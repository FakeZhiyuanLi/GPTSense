      My stomach is about to fucking burst.  I just housed a ginormous plate of Imperial Chicken, but it was made with the super thin noodles that you get in Singapore noodles.  And it had shitloads of ginger in it, which makes me fiesty, but also makes me happy.  I absolutely love ginger, and spicy-ness.  and this dish had it all.  and then i ate a piece of cake, mostly because i'm a fatty, but also because I was honored as employee of the month today (dunk you very much).    Tonight I have to watch Beth's place.  that blows - she's got those shithole little sugar gliders that freak me out, especially since one of the fucks bit me.  it didn't break the skin or anything, but i still got tested for leprosy, because i know it grows well on the snouts of armadillos.  fun fact of the day!  Tonight we're also having some beers, we being me, CM and MS.  its not like a thursday night ritual or anything, but MS leaves for London on friday, and CM, well, he just needs to get out of his apartment - i worry sometimes that he'll be a recluse.    i had a weird deal on the elevator today.  and i decided that before i go, i want to make out with a girl on an elevator.  i'm sure it seems petty to most people (even though the only person that reads this blog is Jared), but to me, it just seems like a pretty sweet situation to be smooching with your lady friend.  so that was my big decision of the day.  oh, that and the fact that i have to call krisy for her b-day.  by the way, happy b-day Jared.  24, compadre - kudos on a job well done!    started checking out jobs in portland, oregon today.  seems like everybody is so fickle when it comes to places to move.  i've stood fast with portland for a while now, and i know jared is hell-bent on it, but shit, Lutwin is obsessed with Asheville, NC right now, and Shenkman probably won't ever leave Santa Barbara, and chaz is stuck in frikkin rochester.  its weird. I think Portland or Nashville are my two big choices at this point.  mainly because i love Nashville and Portland is supposed to be the greatest place in the states.  per JS, my neighbor...  so what's in the news...oh yeah, that Washingtonienne chick didn't go to syracuse!  i totally would've known someone who knew someone who knew her.  but she's just a frikkin media opportunist.  i wonder if she thought that because she was dishing all that dirt on those people that she'd probably get something out of it?  a bit of indirect blackmail or something....not a bad idea  Oh, I also wish i was voted "Most Likely to Commit a White-Collar Crime" instead of "Most Outgoing" - insert bad joke here  Cheers,   The Peach

      So I've decided I'm going to try and go to New Orleans this weekend to visit a professor of mine from school, Traci.  Traci's the bomb, and the person directly responsible for me trying to start my own magazine ( urlLink placesmagazine@hotmail.com ) and for making me grow up to be someone other than my high school persona.    And regardless, I think she'll have some good advice for MS and my's book about the fashion of African Dictators (and its copyrighted, so don't try to steal it).  But then again, can my body handle another stint in the big Easy?  Can I drag myself through the pain of Bourbon street and the agony of vomit, urine and death stink once again?  I should say so, but I'm not in the mood to waste assloads of money doing it, so I'm attempting to be coy and cost-conscious about the whole deal.  Which means calling Abena, which is one thing I definitely don't want to do...  I'm definitely going to bring my video camera, so maybe I can do a travlog while I'm there, to get my other website up and running.  But alas, its such a bitch to do shit like this.  Oh well, i'll figure it out...  somewhere in between all this, I'm supposed to take the GMAT and apply for biz school - don't know how i'll fit that in.  Tonight though, i'm going to continue work on my very crude mock-up of what the magazine will look like.  i don't know what the market is for something like this magazine, but goddamm, i just want to get it done and pitch it to some publishing houses.  maybe then i can quit my job...  till then folks...

      MH and SB?  Holy shit folks, nothing this weird has come out of Canandaigua in a long time.  Guess its time to finally confront those terribly twisted feelings of non-closure I always had with SB.  And to think, I was hoping he'd be hooking up with JH, because that would take a lot of pressure of seeing her on the 4th off of me.  But whatever, kudos to MH and I hope he gets her to submit something to my magazine - that would be incredible.    SB is: 1.  The first girl I ever said "I Love You" to 2.  The first girl I ever cheated on (thrice, with JH, SBr and KL) 3.  The first girl I truely did love. 4.  The only girl I ever respected and dated.  I'm stupid - my whole deal in high school was to come across as some smooth fucking kid, and I managed to sidestep the whole issue of that little thing I call 'my emotions.'    I had the perfect setup with SB.  It was January and I was still with JH, but had been talking to SB since like October.  We broke up because of my first cheating incident.  I hooked up with SBr (who, coincedentally, has a kid now and who's sister died in a car crash - weird).  Anyway, we broke it off, but could never quite put the fire out.  She was with Munn, I with JH.  Anyway, I gave her a ride home after school one day, and drove her out to her house, but only kissed her hand because I didn't want to appear as a cheater to her too.  That night, I broke it off with JH and got back together with her.  It was an incredible ride until about June, when I realized I'd be going to college and started to freak out.  I cut bait...completely.  No calls, no contact, no nothing.  And it was nothing she did, it was just that I was consumed with the fear of leaving everything I had grown to know and preside over.  I called her in July, said it wasn't working out, and hung up the phone.    And I think thats why I'm creeped out that MH and SB are together.  I mean, I know how awesome she is, and I'm sure she just got more awesomer when she went to college (she's 2 years younger than I).  And thus its the lamentations of someone who missed their chance - an epic theme that runs through my life...  There's a lot of things I regret when it comes to life, but to girls, there's only 4: 1.  Fucking things up with SH 2.  Not talking to SL that fateful night at the Tick Tock when I had the chance 3.  Dream Girl 2 - BS - Not picking up the obvious signs on that one. 4.  Getting involved with JH after the first rollercoaster ride in high school.  So there it is folks - that list can only get better, as I add more and more weird stuff to it compliments of Houston, TX.  Lates,   Peaches

      JM just put up a poll asking which, out of all my friends in the Patriotic Drum Club of Canandaigua, would make the best uncle.  While he also added Big John, CKP's dad, as an option, I think it'd be fun to delve into this topic a little deeper.  Out of all my friends, Jared I think would be the best person to introduce your wife too - he's sweet, sincere, positive, and thoughtful.  I don't know if he could handle a couple of buns that came out of my wife's oven though...because those would be some jumpy, spicy, weird buns.  Then again, I'd freak out if I had to deal with anyone's kids too.  Chaz, too, would be really good with kids.  Until he found my emergency 12-pack of Genny Creamers in the fridge and I'd come home to find him passed out on the floor, a dirty diaper slapped on his back, and my kids running around buck naked, having drank like 5 Hi-C coolers.    I think dalas would freak out really quick.  Same with Josh - they'd think way too into everything and be like, "this is your   child  " and then like freak out and run out of the county or something.    Rich would be that cool uncle you see every two years.  Of course, he'd probably teach your kids how to shoot guns and hide the evidence.  No he wouldn't - he'd probably bounce them on his knee and play sax all day.  Which is what i'd do if I had kids and could play sax.  Honestly, I would NEVER leave my kids with Wade.  Not only is he so irresponsible that he can barely take care of himself, but he smells weird and has horrible hygeine.  If my kids' needed a diaper change, he wouldn't do it - he'd probably just hose them down in cheap perfume and put some powder on his own butt.   I think I'd be a good uncle.  I'd play with kids, take them wherever, spoil them absolutey rotten, sing stupid songs and play stupid games with them (like hide and seek).  But the good news about being an uncle is that at the end of the day, you get to give the kids back.  which might actually make me sad.  I want kids for sure - in fact, i love kids.  something awesome about their innocent spirit and wide-eyed happiness - and i could give them pony rides.    later taters,   Peaches

      So referencing an earlier post, "Friendship Grievance," this weekend gave me some serious time to really consider what I'm going to do about that whole situation.  I think thats it - Wade is too much of a waste of space to even be bothered by now.  Everyone has tried to motivate him to get out and do something, and he just lays on the couch like a worthless slug, stinking up the apartment and making people realize how terrible he truly is.  Thus, that's it.  I'm washing my hands of the whole affair and breaking ties with him diplomatically.  Here's a list of things that will happen as a result:  1.  I forfeit my ability to obtain free drinks at the Temple and my ability to order drinks and receive VIP status. 2.  He is immediately removed from the automatic-invite list for future Canteen functions. 3.  Active attempts to visit him when I go home will be ended. 4.  He is now just another person and enjoys absolutey no communication with me.  I'm sure there are a lot more things I'll do, but for now, that list should suffice.  Sure, he's probably got some sort of psychosis and needs to be on medication.  Sure, its all a cry for help.  But we already did this - he got a 0.0 at college and everyone tried to get him to get back on track.  He never did, and thats not my fucking problem.  Its hard enough for me to take care of myself down here, on my own, reforging my own existence - its not my role to step in and pick up the slack for him.  I mean, shit, he didn't even finish at bonaventure!  and he only had to take like 3 more classes!  what a cockwad!  Anyway, enough of this crap...  Peaches

      Meetings are the most worthless workplace-oriented ritual I've ever experience.  I go in, sit there for like 2 hours, stare at the wall, or obsessively chew my pen to bits, nodding and smiling, making occasional eye contact with the speaker, pretending to write stuff on my notified, and try to keep myself awake.  Yesterday's meeting was about how our office needs to work harder to cover phone calls that come in and don't get answered.  Now, logically, one would think that, rathter than tacking on another low priority duty to everyone in the office, we'd just hire a fucking receptionist for 8 bucks an hour and have the problem solved.  But no, my department would rather try to force everyone else, who has more important shit to do, to pick up the tab on this one.  Well, as you can see, I lost it.  Here's a transcript of my comment from yesterday:  BOSS: "Are their any other comments or questions about the phone problems?"  ME: "Yeah, ummmm, instead of calling all these meetings, instituting a completely new phone line, retraining 60 staff members, and wasting money by catering all these informational sessions, why don't we redirect that money into hiring a secretary?" ROOM: SILENCE BOSS: "Ok, if you come up with any other comments, email me.  Meeting adjourned.  So my boss totally dissed me, which I'm used to (SEE: trying to pin information security issues on me) but the fact that nobody had the sack to step up and back me up is ridiculous.  Such a climate of fear and its disgusting.  I'm just glad I really don't have anything to lose at this job.  Not that I'm advocating getting fired, but shit, I need to be doing something else with my life than sitting here, listening to old-ass secretaries bitch and moan about how hard it is to work...  So anyway, as a consolation to my comments from yesterday, I was voted departmental employee of the month, probably because everyone felt guilty for not backign me up yesterday - what a load of shit.  But i'll take that 25 dollar gift certificate and get bomblasted with it.  OTHER NEWS  So I was sort of seeing this girl - actually, not even that, more like pre-mature seeing, if there is such a thing.  We smooched twice, which ruled (because smooching always rules), but whatever, then she went to the Indio festival in California and got railed six ways from Sunday by her ex-boyfriend.  So she got back and I accepted the excuse that she gave me - "I'm gonna give it another try with my ex-boyfriend."  But anyway, so last weekend a group of us went out to the River Cafe - her included.  Well, I found out last night that she was hitting on MS, my boy.  Now I'm not mad at MS, because he's the Mack and can't help that beautiful ladies hit on him, but I am a bit confused about what this girl's deal is.  Her response to the query: "I just want to have fun."  I laughed - don't all 21-year olds just want to have fun?  A foolish gamble on my part - but one that felt really awesome at the time.  Being liked by/liking someone is awesome, especially in this case, because it was such an "out of the blue" sort of deal.  She tried to apologize to me at the River Cafe though, which was odd.  She said, "sorry about not getting back to you" and I said, "no worries."  what I should've said was simple, "no worries, I've got better things to do than to wait around for a girl to make up her mind about me.  I did that in college, which explains why you're pulling the same bullshit right now."  So I can add her to my infamous list of "One Strikes."  I have a seriously stringent policy - I was such a hounddog in high school and college with going back and breakign up and going back with girls that I've instituted a one-strike policy with all girls I date.  They've got one chance with me (and vice versa) and then its done, because I have serious problems with closure in relationships (SEE: Jaime).    good news is that I'm starting to come out of this haze I've been in lately.  lalaland is a mess, especially when you just move to a city.  and now that I'm out of the haze, my confidence/tolerance level is slowly creeping up.  Ladies of Houston - watch out!  Peaches

      So me and all my friends sort of treat our friendship community like its a state entity, with all sorts of personal accountability, rules of law, and binding contracts.  Well, yesterday I found out, as did JM, JS and the whole kittenfoot gang, that Wade is going to see the Pixies in August in NYC.  And suffice to say, that is a gross violation of one of the oldest contracts in the bunch.  Josh and Kevin have   always   agreed that they'd see the Pixies together whenever they came out of retirement.  Well, just goes to show that Wade is not a team player, or else he's just a raging dickwad(e).    So i took it upon myself to file a grievance on our message board (no, you won't get the address) and chastise Wade for this move.  anyway, long story short, nobody will answer, because everyone thinks i post on that site just to hear myself talk.  which is why i started this deal, because i really do love to hear myself talk, but now i can slowly withdraw from that board.    it is a dick move on wade's part though.  i mean, first off, josh liked the pixies before anybody (not that its a contest...actually, it is) and wade, the serial-bandwagon boy, hopped on right behind him.  i mean, its like the vice president giving the state of the union address - completely inappropriate.    and what's worse, Wade may go see the pixies with Kiara, the embodiment of evil, the end of the world.  Kiara, as very few know, was part of the "Infamous Three" that came to Canteen III, drank all the booze, and nearly started a forest fire.  If it was up to me, I would've left that bitch (the other girl besides Kiara) in the goddammed gulch and let her figure out how to get back up on her own.  fucking worthless bags of dogshit.  So now Wade will probably bring Kiara, who has no respect for anyone, or anything for that matter - probably including herself, but I'm not one too judge (often).    Needless to say, Wade is a sore spot in my world.  I'm absolutely convinced that Wade harbors a deep-seeded hatred of me, primarily because he thinks I overtook his place in "the group" during high school.  Which i obviously did not, because a.  I'm not the worthless, repetitive funny man that he always tries to be, and b.  he was being phased out during early high school by everyone else.  He also hates me because of Kate Lillis, but I hate him equally, so I won't elaborate on that point...  Anyway, enough ranting out of me for now - back to the grind...  CatCrap

      So this is it, the first post in what may turn out to be like 5 actual posts.  No, I kid.  Actually, since I have absolutely nothing to do at work most days, this could be a pretty productive waste of my time.    So let's see - the big hubbub with me and all my friends is when our annual party, The Pristeen Canteen - will be held this year.  Since its a N-S enterprise, with JM as the silent partner, we have ultimate creative and logistical control over the whole deal.  So this year, we put together quite an elaborate scheme that makes it seem like those that attend are voting on the location, when in fact, I still control where it'll be.  I'm advocating New Orleans at this point, but if worse comes to worse, we can always have it in Houston again.  Just, unlike last year, people will only be allowed to stay for like 3 days - after that, I'll probably pull out a shoe with a leather sole and beat Wade to death or something - but thats his problem.   So yeah, I don't think I've actually done any work in nearly a month.  And everyone says, "well you must do something" and I snarkily retort "actually no, I send out maybe one work-related email every day, that's it!"  And I get paid generously to do this job, even though nobody is actually quite sure what it is that my job is.  and I intend to keep it that way...  I think my friends are actually freaked out that I'm the one, out of all of them, that's supposed to be in the "real world," when in fact, I'm not - I'm in a fucking fantasy land where nobody even knows (nor cares) what I do.  Which is fine - I'm Mr. Clutch when I need to be, swooping in, cleaning up messes and putting out fires, but I actually prefer to stay way the hell out of the whole scene.    Besides that, I don't do much.  I live in an apartment complex much like Melrose Place, only nobody's getting their fuck on.  Well, scratch that, MS is and Courtney is always making the downstairs neighbors slam their broom into her ceiling, even at 56.  She's a real trooper.    The quality of my complex has suffered immensely recently.  I have to say this, and knowing completely well that absolutely nobody will read this, I can't stand Chad - he's one of the sketchiest dudes I've ever met.  First off, he sounds like someone hid a chainsaw in his throat.  Seriously...try talking to someone using only the spot where your throat connects to your body.  Second, he's just sketchy - he like says in appropo things all the time and constantly tries to drag people into debate.  And third, well, he's definitely an underhanded dude that has officially come up on my radar.  Dacus was rocking it for a while, I didn't give a rats ass what he did, and thats cool.  But shit, when he threw the old K-curve, dicing me like I was an onion, well, I was a little bit furious.  No worries though, he's a messed up dude if he thinks he's gonna get away with that...  I like John - he's a good dude, but goddammm man, that dude talks like the old host of the Micromachine commercials.  SIDEBAR: I had like 100 of those stupid-ass little cars, and I have no idea where they are now.  MS is the jock dude, a great guy to chill with and I feel honored to have met him.  LH, well, he's all good in my book, but dammit man, I think I've been supporting the smoking habits of two people for like a year with all the smokes he's bummed off me.  Not to say that he hasn't returned the favor, but mutherfucker man, thats my lifeblood right there.    Courtney - shit, I can devote an entire psychological thesis to that woman - but she's my neighbor and she makes me breakfast every so often, so I've got no complaints on that.    Well, tomorrow I think I'll start tearing into the boys from home, which could get ugly - everybody bring your "I Hate Wade" hats, because its gonna be a bashfest tomorrow.

      Well, its time folks, its finally time.  Tomorrow, I make my thrice yearly pilgrimage back to Canandaigua to revel in some 4th of July fun.  But alas, and I say this with all honesty, this is perhaps my last year of going back to Canandaigua for this pilgrimage.  Slowly but surely, I am attempting to phase out visits home, simply for the reason that there's nothing really there for me anymore.    Don't get me wrong - I love to go home, to sit out by the lake, with the cool breeze, and just shoot the shit.  But so much has changed - the city has become an eyesore, the cottage is gone, hell, most of my friends are gone.  Its an empty city, and I need to help my mom and stepdad (but not meg) escape.    Interestingly enough, this year, I may in fact phase out my Thanksgiving visit, and instead travel to Paris to hang out with Sagar in the middle of that city.  I should probably work on my German before I go there, just so I can be the jerk that is American and only speaks German in Paris.    Anyway, this year's Canandaigua 4th of July crowd is going to be markedly different from last year.  Not to delve back into the mayhem of one year ago, but lets just say that one particular person is now absent from the group.  What a weird, weird time that was, but I digress.  When I arrive tomorrow, it will probably be me, Chaz and Rich in Canandaigua at any one time, supposing that Chaz doesn't go back to Rochester, which is a slim chance.  No worries there though, I've been looking forward to spending some quality time with Rich.  A lost gem that has returned in the wake of the post-graduation blues (not to be confused with the positive blues).    I am excited though - Drumm and Dave both get into Canandaigua on Friday, and the weather for the weekend looks to be really nice.  I'm super-excited to just sit, grill and drink on the party liner all day on Saturday and Sunday.  Plus, I have to cook up some ribs for Mr. Parkhurst, one of my yearly duties, since I abducted his son and took him to Houston with me.  Man, what a weird road trip it was with that lanky bastard in the Acclaim.    So the other major problem with going home is how to avoid the infamous ex-girlfriend, the devil incarnate who entices me to do stupid things, especially with the aid of my good friend gin.  I'm stupid, and I'll admit it.  I see her, get all weird nostalgic like I have to talk to her and make things right, and then something bad ends up happening.  I'm not goin to delve into what exactly happens - thats patient-doctor confidentiality, but it isn't in my best interest.  The good news, thankfully, is that she hangs out at a different bar in town.  But that doesn't exactly guarantee that I'll be able to avoid her completely.  My best bet on drinking establishments for my vacation at home are simple - stay out of town, or stay very low key.  Thus, the Boathouse, The Sandbar and Wally's are my best bets.  Wally's was a great callled, made by Jared (http://thisiswhat.blogspot.com/) when we were discussing possible drinking strategies in town.  Another good angle to play is to just hang at someone's house and buy a ton of beer.  Beer is so much cheaper up in Canandaigua than down here in Houston - and I have no idea why.    So I'm also trying a new policy of non-PR tour when I go home.  I am not going out of my way to see people - if someone truly wants to hang out with me, they'll need to come and find me - its as simple as that.  That way, when people say, "oh man, why didn't you hang out?" I can retort, "Because I don't have a car, and you do, so thusly, why didn't   you   hang out?"  I'm also hauling my video camera back up with me, hopefully so I can capture some good footage during the vacation.  Not that I'm that inspired to - I think I need someone else there to really get me into the filming type of mood - be it Jared, Josh or Dalas.  Of course, video that Jared and I would make would probably be the most non-funny funny clip ever, mostly because we'd be the only two that'd understand just what was happening.    I even have some official business to take care of while at home - Dave needs me to find a disk with some of the old invitation files on it, plus we need to keep going over layout business - which sucks so bad.  Oh, and I have to get a haircut.  At least I wasn't dumb enough to try to have dinner with Meghann Connor - which would've been a terrible idea anyway.    So that's it - I don't know if I'll have a post between now and Tuesday, but you can check out all the photos I take at http://jessenull.fotopages.com...  Take Care,   Peaches  P.S.  Beth Slater, if you're reading this, will you marry me?

      So this weekend was pretty sweet.  And I'm all spaced out and confused to prove it.    Friday was cool, but also really weird.  I mean, I think its actually my dream to plant myself at the W. Alabama Icehouse and just drink ice cold Lonestars for the rest of my life.  I think if I won the superlottery jackpot thing, I'd totally do that for the rest of my life - and St. Peter would give me a huge thumbs up at the Pearly Gates for using my time so wisely.  The Press people though, outside of MS and CM, are bunch of nuts. I get the feeling all the Press people are like, "who's this douchebag middle manager who rolls in with Golden Boy and the Sexual Deviant" all the time.  which is fine, because I rule and they drool, but it makes for awkward social events.  But the response to both of our books, plus our magazine idea, was overwhelmingly positive, so I think I can't discount them completely yet.  I had a hot dog there with chili on it, but the chili definitely didn't taste quite right.  Regardless, it filled me up, and that was all that mattered.    After that, we went across the street to T.K. Bitterman's and I realized one obvious thing.  That George guy who's one of the editors is a big retard.  I mean, I hear basically every reporter bitch about how he destroys their pieces, and then you see him out and he acts like a retarded dude with a mustache.  I mean, I'm sure he's seen some cool shit, and I'm sure he has an inkling of what his job really is, but based on all the criticism, it seems like he's out to steer all the stories towards his views, and thats some seriously fucked up shit.  I mean, to direct all the news stories opinions in the same vein that you think, thats crap.  once that happens, it becomes propaganda.  i mean, its cool that the Press is already a total waste of news space, outside of a few key articles, but too add insult to injury, jeez.    Mike joked that I was macking on SF, and thats not something to joke about.  The more I talk to her, the more I try to figure out how she came out of Cleveland, went to Wooster, and remained Republican.  and she called herself a Neo-con, but that that phrase was misinterpreted.  I just think she's retarded.  Don't get me wrong, she's a very cool girl, but I think she's a total mole, and a behind-the-scenes management girl.  I mean, not to Novak her, but someone mentioned she's doin one of the big wigs.  Its cool though, nobody reads this blog, so I'm not worried about breaking news or anything.  Regardless, T.K. Bitterman's ruled, and the other guy, Stephen, was a seriously chill dude.    The more I think about it, the more I'm interested in raiding the Houston Press office for an editorial staff if I get my magazine off the ground.    So Saturday was interesting too.    Most of the day was spent just hanging out.  That is, until Schilling Conversation Vortex showed and sucked most of the life right out of me.  I mean, this guy talks about how much he hates his job and the people he works with, but then goes out to these functions and what not and gets completely wasted, then comes back and unloads this shit on the people around him.  I don't know about you, but I don't deal well with people like that, which makes me become more and more scarce when they're around.  He's a cool guy, he just needs to absolutely fucking relax and stop drinking margaritas and then telling people his life story.    So after that incident, we headed over to a BBQ that was at another Press person's apt.  It was me, MS, CM and Schilltron 3030 (along with 6 margaritas).  First off, the place was in a parking lot, and it was insanely hot that day, with no breeze whatsoever.  Second it was an apt. complex wide party, so I didn't know a lot of the people around.  Third, CM was sweating like it was going out of style, and Schilltron sucked a ton of people into the conversation vortex (thank god it wasn't me).    It was supposedly a vegan bbq, but there were tons of rotting corpses of dead animals, in the form of hot dogs, hamburgers, sausage, etc.  All very tasty too, I might add.  And tons of beers.  So much so, that Schilltron went off, drank a ton, and then would disappear into this girl's apartment and play the guitar.  I think he got really pissed though, because every time I came in to take a leak, I'd say, "oh, playing Redemption Song again?" and then sing the first 5 chords of the song.  I bet he was playing some shitty ass Foo Fighters song, because Schilltron is in love with Dave Grohl. Creepy.  Anyway, back downstairs, SF and Stephen, as well as Trent Steele and Kathy were all there.  I get the feeling that Kathy doesn't like me at all.  I also get the feeling that Keith is a cool dude, but Kathy has him by the balls (totally) and he can't loosen up when everyone is around.  But that whole situation is another headache that I'd rather not discuss.  Stephen's girlfriend was there, and its nice to meet someone that can sympathize with working in organized healthcare.  She hates her job, I hate mine, so we have even ground there.  And she was really chill.  So this one chick had a Bichon Frise dog, the one that looks like a ragged cottonball, and I wanted to kick it over the fence, except the girl who had the dog was pretty hot.  Actually, she was in a big gaggle of hot girls, and she totally diced MS at one point.    MS: "What's your dog's name?" Girl: "Oh, it's name is DON'T EVER TALK TO ME AGAIN!"  You'd have to see the scene to appreciate it, but it was seriously funny.  She gave a really cold response, implying that he needs to step off.  We all just laughed.  But another girl in the group she was with was very attractive, at least to me (Malisow mentioned complexion problems) and I really wanted to go up and talk to her.  So I plotted my move by goin to get a beer and then offering her one, but she disappeared before I could even offer her a beer.  So alas, no success, and I got so disheartened by it that I lost my will to do it.  I need to get out there more, because thats the only way I'm gonna get a stupid girlfriend.    Anyway, that party winded down, so we headed back to the old BV to finish off the night.  This is where the night got super-weird.  When we walked up, Jimmy, my old downstairs neighbor, was at the apartment.  That dude hasn't been around in like months, and he was just hangin there, like old times.  That was creepy, because that dude is completely weird.  He's a total frat-rock guy, but the stories I've heard make me think he's seriously messed in the head.  And I got all weirded out because I wasn't in the mood to have the "hey man, i called you a bunch of times" conversation with him, especially when i'm wasted and Dacus and Kalyn are hangin around like vultures.  Just absolutely weird.  Not to mention, Schilling is cruising in and out of my apartment like its a Sonic and I'm serving cherry limeade - what a bastard.    But yeah, it was a very weird weekend.  Not to mention, Wade decided to phone me up and tell me that Reagan was coming to the Canteen.  So today I had to double-duty it and contact Chazbo to make sure it was cool that she was coming.  Jared keeps mentioning Wade is going to try and take control of the Canteen, and if indeed he does, I'm going to flip out and disappear in the Big Easy and let all those bastards sort it out.  If Wade wants to be in control, have him try to coordinate 15 fucking people coming to one city and getting bottom dollar for it all.  And I hope he's got enough money, because New Orleans can become a downright expensive place if you just want to drink all day.    Anyway, I'm tired of ranting...  Cheers,   Peaches Joyale, the most beautiful Wiffleball Player ever

      In case anyone other than Jared reads this little suaret into the inner workings of my brain, I'm attempting to start a magazine.  I think I've mentioned it before, but I just wanted to give everyone an update:  1.  Dave is finalizing the website.  Last time I talked to him, he was working out the glitches in the online submission mechanism, which absolutely rocks.  I saw a demo of the intro page, and it rocks.  Dave style, definitely, with the smooth steel look and lots of intricate designs, but awesome nonetheless.  2.  Julia (the soon-to-be CFO/CPO of the company) is hounding all of her journalism school friends to submit to the magazine.  I don't know how big the initial press run is going to be, but I'm hoping we get like 15 good, solid pieces in, plus a bunch of pictures.  I'm not sure whether Dave is talking about launching the website by the end of July or the actual print magazine - I guess I should clarify that.  3.  I've been pitched the idea of starting a publishing company for the first time.  Instead of a magazine, we publish the travel essays and photos in like a limited book release.  I think its a good idea, but I like the fluidity and constant freshness of a magazine.  For the reasons that its safe to do a book, its also boring and void of good ideas.  However, a publishing company could also be utilized to produce my book on the Fashion of African Dictators, which will be an instantaneous hit.    4.  I've got to get some potential donors/advertisers lined up as soon as we get a proof of the magazine.  Then, hopefully, people will line up to associate with this corporate juggernaut.  I also need to do a bunch of operational shit, like find an office and see what that costs, etc.  Goddamm, there's way too much involved in starting a fucking business.  I need my MBA.  Its a great setup though - here's the designations:  CEO, COO - J. Null CFO, CPO - J. Ramey CIO, CTO - J. Moran Manager - C. Parkhurst Design Director - D. Barry Editors-at-large - M. Serazio, C. Malisow, J. Shenkman Then there'll be a bunch of staff writers, plus some interns that i get to yell at.    I keep having this vision of the executive offices above the "pit" where the writers are, and me, peering through the blinds with binoculars and a cigarette strategically placed between the blinds.  I am a management maniac, and I'll stay the hell out of the way of my writers, but goddammit, I'm a nasty fucker when it comes to getting shit done.  Not to mention, Julia is a good bearer-of-bad-news.  Jared, well, he'll probably design an office that like floats in space on some sort of semiconductor or mag-lev theory.  He's good at that shit, and thats why I want him being head of the tech shit.  Oh yeah, and he's exempt from the dress code, under the condition that he starts a band with other people in the office.  As for the writers, my god, i don't envy them.  If Shenkman thinks its tough running a fucking carousel, I don't think he'll be prepared for corporate America.  I'm not trying to be a dick, but I don't think a lot of my friends take this seriously.  I will get this publication off the ground, if it kills me, which it probably will.    It'll be plush though - they get to go all over the world on my dime and write stories.  So if their work lacks something, I won't hesitate to fire them on the spot.  Goddammed Julia won't fire anybody, even though she's director of personnel.  I like the idea of me being seen as an office tyrant.    Anyway, enough rambling, I need to develop a business proposal on a magazine and a publishing company...  Lay-tron Means  Peaches

      Well, ladies and gentlemen, I think its all coming together now.  As most folks know, my summer wear tends to push more towards the Hamptons/Martha's Vineyard style, what with the abundance of linen and pastels.  Well, to complete the transformation, I need only a few more items.    1.  Linen Suit 2.  Seersucker Suit  3.  White bucks 4.  Madras Pants  Well, we can knock #4 off that list, because I bought a fucking pair of Madras pants at Nieman Marcus yesterday, while shopping with my sister and Stephen (STEPHEN!).  What's worse, Stephen bought these unsightly red pants with all sorts of designs all over them and he's goin to debut them when he goes to Provincetown.  YIKES!!!  Good news is they were on sale and that they really do fit good.  Its weird to shop with girls and gay men - it does a lot for your self esteem.  In this case, it made me feel good that my butt really wasn't all that big and that the fit of the pants didn't make me look like a walrus.    What, you ask, do I wear these pants with?  Well, interestingly, and simply enough, the only shirt that would actually match well with these pants is a simple white, short-sleeved polo.  That's it.  Nieman's had this awesome Polo brand one that was ultra light, made out of Peruvian Pima Cotton, but shit, that shirt was like 85 bucks!  The pants themselves were only 50, and I could totally rationalize spending that much on pants as awesome as these...  I'll take a picture and post the link for all to see.  Next stop, a Captain's Hat!

      I spoke to JS on monday night, in regards to the Canteen.  Its a N-S venture, with JM as the silent silent partner.  It was weird - and I don't think he gets the fact that it takes a serious amount of planning to pull off an event like this, especially when you're not holding it in a fucking field in Naples.  Its just ridiculous, and its taking its toll on me.  I've got Rich, dalas and Wade who are fighting me every step of the way, and we're actually about a month behind on shit like this.  I haven't even thought about a fucking invitation, nor am I going to.  I say if JS wants in on this, he needs to pull some weight.  The thing that infuriates me though, is that I'm getting second-guessed on everything, and its getting old.  Originally, I was investigating a way to have the Canteen at Cape Hatteras, but good lord, you wouldn't believe how expensive that would've been.  Well now, dalas and Rich, the naysayers, are asking why I didn't choose to have it there.  When, for some odd reason, they forgot that it doesn't matter where I choose to have it, as its JM's, JS's and my fucking project, not theirs.    This business with the Canteen, however, is bringing about a fundamental change in the dynamic of this group of friends...we are becoming bipolar, with one side, represented by me, JM, KD, KS and all the others that have real jobs, and the other by KW and dv, the two that are obviously worthless sacks of shit.  Everyone else sort of falls into the gray area between those, but its gettin dangerous.  Wade has the balls to say, "I can see them anytime" and decides to go to the Pixies show?  Fair enough, because when I'm home for the 4th of July, I'll be shaving my asscrack hair, because "I can see Wade any time."  And you can forget about the Temple - I'll be spending my money at any other bar, besides that place.    I'm getting into one of my blue periods, which usually happens right around the time I go home for the 4th of July.  I think this is the last year.  Next year, maybe I'll go to France and see Sagar or somewhere just for me...  I hate going home, in many ways.  I miss my mom and stepdad to death, and like to be sure that they're doing alright, but I despise seeing my little sister, and every john, tom and steven that you see at Wegmans (another inevitable trip).  I hate seeing the same people, and having the same conversations.  And worst of all, I hate seeing my ex-girlfriend, because its super awkward.  its like, "hey, sorry i bolted and didn't talk to you for two years while you got railed by every dude at cortland."  its a real weird paradigm there, and rather than deal with it, i usually just try to avoid it all together.  pretty sad vacation, where you try to avoid everything thats there...and then i usually end up hooking up with her, which doesn't help the cause at all...  MS also mentioned to me that sagar may be considering moving to toronto.  if so, i think i may pull up my stakes in london and head north of the border to work with him.  i really miss Thakrar - he's a great dude and should be in houston.  Period.  End of Sentence.

      Tonight is the big night...  John and I have decided to get Dacus back for all the beers, all the off-the-cuff remarks, all the dumb shit he's done since John and I got there.    So here's the plan:  Some time around 9 pm (give or take), I'm going to put 4 crushed up laxatives in a beer.  I'll then give the beer to Dacus, who won't know its been spiked, because he drinks all my beer and never pays me back.  Stage One complete.  Some 15 minutes later, we'll serve him up some free taco bell tacos, and because he's a giant slop of a troll man, he won't turn down the free tacos and instead will devour them like a vulture picking apart a groundhog.  this will add a good base to the giant shit he'll take in a half hour.  Stage Two complete.  15 minutes after that, we'll proffer some shots of obscure alcohol up to him, accusing him of being weak that he can't do shots.  Only his shot of booze will actually be syrup of Ipecac.  He'll say it tastes weird, and we'll say its from Austria and to shut his piehole and get out of the apartment.  15 minutes after that, we'll watch, quietly, waiting for him to burp, for his face to turn pasty white, and for him to run off to puke/shit.  We're hoping that if he pukes first, it'll set off a chain reaction for him to shit.  By the time he starts puking, the body will be primed to crap out everything that was in there.  We're hoping there's a public display.  Mission Accomplished.  I don't want to hear it - Dacus deserves it, no matter how cruel this punishment is.  I've got to go to the pharmacy,   Peach

      So another battle with Wade today.  On the old Kittenfoot message board, he has the balls to put this up:   I wouldn't even call Null if I were you. He won't answer if it is after 6 pm, your name has a D or an E in it, or if you leave a message that makes no sense. He has so much anger. Now that is a good question: "Who is the angriest friend?"   I don't answer that fuckwad's calls because its usually something to the tune of "dude, i'm so drunk" or else some terrible comedy bit that he's trying to pass off as new material, but is just the rapist voice, like maybe 2 keys lower.  We know who the brains of the Sentences and the Comma Dereks are, and they're Rich and Josh.  Kevin is so 1996...  But the thing that really angers me is that he has the balls to call me out as the angriest friend...  Look, I'm not the one that still hasn't dealt with the divorce of my mother and father that happened like ten years ago.  Plus, I don't have serious intimacy issues and obsession complexes with every fucking girl I meet.  I think he better reconsider his definition of the word "angry" because if I was his shrink, that'd be the first thing I figured out about him.    So lets do some self-recognition, and let me delve into a little bit more of my personality.  Kevin is a fuck.  He is just like my little sister.  We are of different generations.  In all of his relationships, he emphasizes ownership, even of abstract things - Radiohead is   his   band, the Temple is   his   bar.  I, on the other hand, have given up that designation structure.  Sure, I listen to a ton of rap music, but I don't explicitly state that each and every group is   mine  .  And lets consider the gaffes that he's made with bands that were his, and their dwindling musical ability, such as Gomez, who figured out how to immediately sell out to the world and do a Phillips/Magnavox add.   Do I need to go into it more?  I'm not painting myself as some bastion of maturity, whereby I do everything right in today's world.  But I am not Wade, and if that makes me angry, then so be it, just so I never actually become like him...

      I hate my job, by the way.  So tomorrow at noon, myself and Schilltron embark to New Orleans, the bastion of sin and hedonism.&nbsp; I am looking so forward to it.&nbsp; Hopefully, we'll arrive around 5, grab rich at the airport on our way in, and then set up shop at the Royal St. Charles Hotel.&nbsp; Then, after I drop them off, I'll have to contact Dave/Sarah J. and have them meet us at the hotel to drop their stuff off.&nbsp; Then I get to drive back out to the airport to pick up the rest of the gang.&nbsp;   I'm vexed at this point, because I'm not sure whether to tell Josh to take a cab into New Orleans or for me to go and pick him up.&nbsp; What a split I'm at.&nbsp; Any suggestions would be useful.&nbsp;

      7 cd's of ROCK under the guise "Where's My Bandana?"   CD1 - The Prototype of Rock  CD2 - Rock (that Rocks)  CD3 - More Rock, Please  CD4 - Rock Ate My Homework  CD5 - Rock is Bigger Than France  CD6 - God Speed, Rock and Roll  CD7 - An Epilogue of Rock   The day started not unlike most saturdays.&nbsp; I woke up, washed and waxed my car, and then hit up the salvo with two things on my mind - t-shirts, and bandanas.&nbsp; I found a great shirt that said "Louisiana Bass Fishing" with this awesome picture of a Bass on it, AND I found a Karate Kid style headband for Malisow.&nbsp; Oh man, how funny it was.&nbsp;   So I bought around 70 bucks worth of groceries, set up everything back at the apt., and started pounding out burgers.&nbsp; The party started at 3, but we commenced rocking at 2:47 PM when Nova Lomax showed up.&nbsp; The Coors Lights were cold, the grill was ready, and the rock was...well, rocking.&nbsp;   Let's see, I'm not gonna go into too much detail, but here are some highlights:  1.&nbsp; Malisow chasing me with the pool skimmer  2.&nbsp; Malisow jumping in the pool with his clothes and his cell phone in his pocket  3.&nbsp; Mike appearing with the life preserver on  4.&nbsp; Everyone being drunk  5.&nbsp; Nova Lomax losing both his keys and his glasses  6.&nbsp; Craig driving home (shame shame) and having Lomax's keys with him  7.&nbsp; Stephen killing almost 3 inches off a bottle of rum  8.&nbsp; Me, taking the award for the longest amount of rock.  9.&nbsp; Julia passing out at like 7 Pm from too much rock  10.&nbsp; The fact that it was almost 100 degrees out when the party started  11.&nbsp; The downpour and uppouring of rock to combat it  12.&nbsp; I twisted my ankle  13.&nbsp; Pounding on Malisow's door to get Lomax's keys  14.&nbsp; That creepy En-freak-ay guy  15.&nbsp; Simon giving a solid rock face...   So thats it, thats all you get!   Go well,   Cory    UPDATE:&nbsp; Stephen&nbsp;caught a ride back to his apartment, thanks to Qamar.&nbsp; Well...Stephen didn't make it into his apartment.&nbsp; Apparently he puked everywhere, then&nbsp;laid in his own filth and passed out.&nbsp; He woke up to the paramedics slapping him out of his slumber.&nbsp; Some cops, some firemen were around for good measure.&nbsp; To make matters worse, they called his girlfriend, and she kicked him out!&nbsp; He's now staying with his parents!&nbsp; Holy shit.&nbsp; Guitarmageddon is an&nbsp;evil force! &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Man, I had this dream last night, but I think I've either had it before or thought about it consciously.&nbsp; So I'm back in high school, and its Spirit Week or whatever, and there's this lip-sync contest.&nbsp; Well, its mostly cheerleaders entering, doing the latest dance to "Here Comes the Hotstepper" or whatever, and me and Jared get the brilliant idea to enter and lip-sync to "I Heard it Through the Grapevine" by CCR.&nbsp; Anyway, our "team" consisted of me, Jared, Tony and Simon.&nbsp; And we had to like audition or whatever.&nbsp; So we all go in, Jared has his axe,&nbsp; Tony has his, and&nbsp;Simon had a few drums.&nbsp; I was playing the role of Mr. Fogarty.&nbsp; Anyway, we all just like sat in a circle, not looking at the crowd, not doing anything, but just fucking lip-rocking out to CCR and it was awesome.&nbsp;   Well, anyway, the panel was 3 teachers - one was the cheerleading coach, and she absolutely hated our idea.&nbsp; One was Mrs. Monje, and she loved us, so she was down.&nbsp; This is where it gets tricky - in my dream, it was Mr. Gray, and he happened to love CCR, so he voted that we perform at the big pep rally.&nbsp; But for some reason, when I think of this now, I thought Mr. Black was the 3rd judge.&nbsp; Regardless, both loved CCR and so we got the go-ahead to perform at the big Pep Rally.&nbsp;   Well, it was an awesome scene.&nbsp; there's the little stage and all the cheerleaders are doing their flips and dances and it was really stupid.&nbsp; Halfway into the first act, CCR-sync comes cruising into the gym, decked out like it was 74.&nbsp; This, of course, after we were drinking Jack out in the parking lot.&nbsp; Here's a description of each person:   Jared :&nbsp; Oh man, Jared is the quintessential CCR member.&nbsp; He had like the bushy brown hair, tied back with a bandana headband.&nbsp; Then he had his aviators, which were silver frames.&nbsp; He had a super-tight t-shirt on that was like a 79 Seattle Supersonics shirt or something.&nbsp; And he had blue corduroys on.&nbsp; Oh, and like old school Pumas - like  authentic  Pumas.&nbsp;    Simon :&nbsp; Man, simon had these super-tight Wrangler jeans on and like the awesomest pair of cowboy boats.&nbsp; They had a rattlesnake design on them and he was rockin the ginormous belt buckle.&nbsp; He had a Harley t-shirt, but the best part was he had this awesome fake beard that was really bushy, and he had a wig that made his hair mad huge.&nbsp;    Tony: &nbsp; Tony had the best mustache I've ever seen.&nbsp; It was bushy and like went down past his chin.&nbsp; Oh man, I'd kill for a mustache like that!&nbsp; He had long hair too, and it was tied back with a confederate flag bandana.&nbsp; And he didnt' have any shoes on!&nbsp; just a pair of cords and a john deere t-shirt.   Me :&nbsp; I think I had the worst get-up out of everyone.&nbsp; I had some tight, dirty jeans on, with a Jack Daniels belt buckle.&nbsp; My t-shirt was super-tight (and I was still a tad chubby in high school) with just a wolf on the front.&nbsp; I had no facial hair, but a giant blonde wig with my aviators with gold rims.&nbsp;   So we walk into the packed gym and sit down with everyone staring at us like we were nuts.&nbsp; And none of us sit together either - we all sit at like opposite ends of the bleachers.&nbsp; Well, we sit there, silent, while all these other groups of kids do like "Ice, Ice Baby" and other crappy pop tunes.&nbsp;  Then they announce it.  "Would Tony, Jared, Simon and Cory please come down.&nbsp; You're up next!"  So each of us like pours out of the bleachers.&nbsp; I've got a tambourine, Jared magically pulls his bass out, Tony's got his guitar, and Simon whips out his drumsticks from his pants.&nbsp; Oh man.  Well, we get down there, and by this time, Mr. Gray is about to burst from wanting to rock out so bad.&nbsp; And Mr. Richardson has this smile on his face like, "Fuck yeah, CCR rules!"  Well, we sit down in our circle and pretend to tune our instruments.&nbsp; Then Jared looks at me and nods, and right on cue, he goes into the familiar starting bass line of "I Heard it Through the Grapevine."&nbsp; And man, for a lip-sync group, we were on point.&nbsp; So I break into, "oooooooohhhhh, I bet you wonder how I knew, bout your plan to make a fool, of some of the guuuuuuuys that you knew before, two of those guys, you know I love you more."&nbsp; And we're just staring at each other, all just rocking hardcore, not even paying attention to the crowd, which is absolutely silent.&nbsp; I look over, and Mr. Gray is like nodding his head and slapping his knee and all the guy teachers are like rocking out silently as we go on.&nbsp;   Well, most folks didn't realize that this tune was about ten minutes long.&nbsp; So Mrs. Biddle like gets up (the cheerleader coach) about five minutes into and is giving us the "wrap it up," sign.&nbsp; I look at Jared and he shakes his head.&nbsp; And Simon's eyes are like wide.&nbsp; So I stand up and turn around, and she's like right there.&nbsp; And I just start lip-syncing, right in her face, "Ohhhhhh, I heard it through the grape vine/Not much longer would you be mine/Oohhhh, I heard it through the grape vine/And I'm just about to lose my mind"   To say the least, Mrs. Biddle got the point that this song rules and she needed to sit down.&nbsp; Kids in the crowd started cheering and I noticed that Munn and Hartnett, who were drunk as well, were totally air-guitaring in the bleachers.&nbsp; Man, it was awesome.&nbsp;   So anyway, we jam out for the next 6 minutes and just keep it on point.&nbsp; The tune ends and Munn belts out, "Born on the Bayou."&nbsp; By this time, we're all actually sweating and tired from air-rocking out so fucking hard.&nbsp; And like maybe 20 kids start clapping - probably the only kids who knew how awesome CCR rocked.&nbsp; But Mr. Gray and Mr. Richardson were all stoked too.&nbsp; Mr. Richardson said, "Boys, its great to hear the classics again!"  Anyway, we didn't win.&nbsp; I think some cheerleaders won for some thong song or something.&nbsp; It was pretty weak.&nbsp; But we just went back outside and hung by Jared's car, drinking Jack and smoking Camel Lights the whole time.&nbsp;   SIDENOTE:&nbsp; This is probably in my top 5 dreams of all time.&nbsp; The fact that, at least in the dream, we did it, made it that much better.&nbsp; And the fact that I actually remembered it made it even better as well.&nbsp;   So there ya go, a little fodder for "Guitarmageddon!"

      Holy shit, One week until the Canteen and my BP (blood pressure) is fucking skyrocketing.&nbsp; No turning back now, we've only just begunnnnnnnnnn...  But before that, I've got to work through GUITARMAGEDDON this weekend.&nbsp; We tried this once before, with the Tricky Dick Springtime Jamboree, but we got rained out (sadly).&nbsp; Mikey came up with the name, but I designed the flyer - and if I may say so, its the best combination of Vans and Nugent the world has ever seen...  Should be fun, just a simple BBQ at the BV with mostly Press people there, maybe some stragglers from the hospital, etc.&nbsp; But the best part is that its gonna be all Classic Rock blaring out of the speakers the whole time.&nbsp; Man, I forgot how much I love Creedence.&nbsp; And GFR.&nbsp; And the Marshall Tucker Band.&nbsp; Can't you see?  Also, I played tennis yesterday with Mike and Julia.&nbsp; It was fun, but I also worked out, so I've got a serious water deficit running in my body right now.&nbsp; My serve is still dead on, but&nbsp; I need to clean up my net game - I hate people that play the net on me.&nbsp; Usually I just smoke the ball right at them and they learn real quick, but for some reason, my backhand wasn't as reliable as it usually is.&nbsp; Oh well, more practice and I'll be fine.&nbsp;

      So i'm designing a shirt that says "Kevin Wade - Stealing Credit Since 1997."&nbsp; Hope he likes it, that goddammed jerk.&nbsp; He still claims he came up with "Goin back to the Harrrr-borrr, whoaaah whoah."&nbsp; But I don't buy it - Chaz was the one that remembered it, and I still think it was a group effort.&nbsp; But you know Wade - always trying to steal everyone's ideas.&nbsp; He even had the audacity to declare that he was "The Face of the Canteen."&nbsp; Well, if you like pimples and a nappy looking beard, then he can be your face.&nbsp; But not on my watch.&nbsp; Not to mention, he thinks he should be on the executive council of the Canteen Committee.&nbsp; Well, the best part is that Dave is probably the next member, mostly because he works his ass off on invitations every year ( pro bono  i might add) and comes up with something awesome.&nbsp; The kicker?&nbsp; Dave and Wade hate each other (Wade more so than Dave, though).&nbsp;  &nbsp; So its getting closer to Canteen Time.&nbsp; I have to admit, I'm super-excited, but also super-nervous.&nbsp; Here's the latest visitor list: &nbsp; Jared Charlotte Josh Kevin D. Kevin W. Chaz Rich Reagan Krisy Dave PJ  Sarah J. Schilltron 3030 Mike (perhaps) Julia (perhaps) &nbsp; Now, in case you can't tell, thats a lot of fucking people.&nbsp; But all I know is that I'm gonna come soaring into town in my car with my Allmans blaring out of the speakers.&nbsp; Josh wants me to pick up some "ahheeemm," but I think I might leave that to Schilling.&nbsp; Lord knows, if that comes out, it'll be the dumb Wade and Josh show all night - doing bits that aren't funny and ignoring everybody else.&nbsp;  &nbsp; You see, ladies and gentlemen, the one thing I absolutely despise about the Canteen is that once the event begins, Josh completely disowns himself of any responsibility.&nbsp; Sure, he'd wake up during the night and cover up the sound equipment, but at Canteen 3, when one of Dalas/Kevin's friends almost started a fucking forest fire, he was too busy off doing his bit with Wade to even give a shit.&nbsp; And that really steamed me.&nbsp; Steamed me to the bone - like a mussel.&nbsp; And then Wade, after the whole incident, decided to come and help, but only got the girl even more in trouble when she almost fell down a gorge.&nbsp; Part of me wishes she did.&nbsp; I was so pissed that night - I stepped on a board with a nail in it when I was trying to put out that damned fire.&nbsp; What a dumb bitch.&nbsp; Excuse my language, but she was...a dumb bitch.&nbsp; Thank God we don't have to pick up those giant yellow lights that Jared had - those were a bitch too.&nbsp; Bitch...too.&nbsp; And I had to catch a flight at 6 am.&nbsp; That was ridiculous as well.&nbsp;  &nbsp; But anyway, I digress.&nbsp; So if Josh completely washes his hands of it like he usually does, then I may be  out .&nbsp; I know, I've threatened this before, washing my hands of the Canteen and what not, but it really is starting to take its toll.&nbsp; It used to be really fun, when the Canteen and all attendees were centrally-located, denying the Ellsworth's any role in the planning, keeping everything a secret.&nbsp; But now, its a bitch.&nbsp; Even last year, just have 5 people fly down was a pain in the ass.&nbsp; But 14 - I worry.&nbsp; The Canteen used to be an event where everyone took care of themselves.&nbsp; But now, with Hotel Accomodations, flights and pick-ups at the airport, I'm starting to get gray hairs.&nbsp; And the diversity of attendees - Rich, Schilling, Sarah J. - I wonder if we're losing the focus of the whole thing, or whether we're just diversifying.&nbsp; Its not that I'm mad these people are attending, but I'm anxious to see how they act.&nbsp; &nbsp; The sad thing is,&nbsp;if I'm  out , I wouldn't be surprised if Jared was too (not to put the pins to ya or anything!).&nbsp; I mean, shit, its one thing planning and coordinating this thing when you're on summer break, but when you're workin full-time, and trying to find a different job somewhere else, it can be extremely stressful.&nbsp; And I know if I pawned all this over onto Josh, he'd run away, mostly because he won't accept responsibility.&nbsp; Jesus, I wish I could just win the lottery and buy a beach house somewhere, so we could have it there every year.&nbsp; That'd just be way easier.&nbsp;  &nbsp; SIDENOTE:&nbsp; Sometimes I get really pissed when nobody really shows any appreciation for what the&nbsp;hell goes into these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;And when I say nobody, I mean Kevin W. - mostly because he's a pompous asshole.&nbsp; So fuck him, and fuck his requests to have more say in the Canteen.&nbsp; 30% of why I keep planning this thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;spite his unclean, bitter ass.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

      Well, I think I sold both Julia and Mike on the idea of New Orleans, so I may have to once again revise my attendance projections...by the way, Julia officially lives in Houston now.&nbsp; Let the games begin! &nbsp; My tooth hurts like a motherfucker.&nbsp; It's like a mid-molar, but the pain shoots back to a part of my brain thats by my neck.&nbsp; The wonders of brain circuitry and pain sensations.&nbsp; Fucking A

      Well, the time has finally come.  Julia, as of 9:10 PM tonight, will officially take up residence at Mike's place in Houston.  What a weird move, from Boston to Houston.  I mean, hey, at least they both end in "on."  Craig and I are planning on watching the whole scene from right outside their window, mostly because we have no lives and because it promises to be an incredibly hilarious scene.    Oh, Schilltron 3030 (the most advanced Laundry/Sleep Machine ever) is considering a run to come to New Orleans for the Canteen.  He also said he'd book another room, which would rule, because it'd give me someone to drive to New Orleans with, and it'd reduce the load of people jammed into 2 rooms.  We shall see I guess.    I've got killer gas today, and a wicked hangover.  The only cure for that is Kam's - best Chinese in Houston.  I know what you're thinking, "i've never really had good chinese food, or bad for that matter."  Well, Kam's is GOOD, not decent, not normal, and you should try it if you're ever in this city.    I just heard a rumor that we're gonna hit 100 today.  Fucking A Peter Man...  J

      And I fixed my playstation 2.  FYI, if you want to open up the box, take all the rubber stoppers off the bottom - thats where they hide the screws.  then take the cover off the disc tray and clean the lens.  That was the only problem with my machine.  Now it plays everything perfectly.  Not to mention, John just beat Red Dead Revolver, so now its my turn to fuck some shit up...

      Well, I talked to my mom last night, and she's terribly concerned that I'm going to wear myself out worrying over this Canteen.  She thinks its a great idea, but there should be more responsibility in the hands of the attendees, rather than the Canteen Executive Committee.  Just like my mom, the Mississippi native, to argue for more States' Rights.  But to that I say, Viva La Federalismo!    And PJ officially bought her ticket.  She gets in pretty early on Friday, and for that I could kill her, but that also means that I'll be up and goin to get some Beignets at Cafe Du Monde right around noon.  Hopefully Jared and Charlotte will accompany me.  I expect everyone else to just get really stoned and do their dumbass bits all day.  Not me though, trying to stay clean and free from it all.  It will be extremely hot though, and I really don't think anyone is comprehending what I say.  Yesterday in Houston it was 96 degrees with 95% humidity.  In New Orleans, it will probably be 99 degrees with 100% humidity.  Which means that Wade will melt, Josh will die, and I will sweat, like a leaky fuckin sprinkler.  But oh well, I'm buying a very light pair of shorts this weekend to combat the heat.    But enough of the Canteen.  Weirdest thing happened on Saturday night.  Courtney's daughter, Shannon, who's like 32 or so, pulled me aside and went into this big speech about how I'm a great guy and I should date older women because I'm more in touch with their mindsets.  I got all weirded out, but was strangely flattered.  And hey, who's against hot late-20's ladies?  I sure am not!  Its tough to talk to shannon those, because she's got giant boobs from these implants she got.  and they are seriously distracting, like someone flashing two giant laser pens right in your field of vision.  Dammit!

      So I'm on this really really big Kebob kick.  Yesterday I whipped some up for me, John, Mike and Courtney.  They were good - 4 colors of peppers, pineapple, chicken, baby potatoes (make sure you boil them first) and some zucchini.  I need more vegetables that I can cook on kebobs.  I almost tried corn on the cob, but I got a little freaked out at that - undone corn is gross, like a fart in a jar.  Anyway, I season it really simply - salt, pepper, and Tony Chachere's Cajun Seasoning - my god it makes it so good.  Makes me want to cry and shoot stuff.  At the same time...  By the way, Kevin Wade is Gay - spread the news like margarine.    Gave Josh the 2 hour rundown about my trip back to the Daigua.  I think he was jealous and happy at the same time, especially when it was Boys Club out on the party boat.  Oh well, there's always next year.  JM mentioned something to the tune that Josh thought Wade should move out to Santa Barbara.  Dumb idea, if you ask me.  I think Josh would finally learn that Wade is a deadbeat thats worth about 2 pounds of unprocessed wheat flour.    Mike and I got wasted on Friday.  I mean Ben-Fuck-Wasted.  We went to Little Woodrow's, met up with David and Ronnie, guys I used to work with, and just started pounding Lonestars like they were the last ones left.  Then David was like, "let's go to Bronx bar" and I was like, "Word up son."  I really like quotation marks.  But Spillers was there, and man, he is some West Texas trash if I've ever seen it.  And Ronnie's buddy Putney kinda looks like Collen from SLU.  Weird.  But we went to the Bronx Bar, which means that David buys shots of Jager.  I try to abstain, he calls me a pussy, etc, etc.  But I had to drive, so Mikey did the shots with him.  Then Mike bought shots of vodka and I was like, "good lord, thats just rude!"  Regardless, we sat there for a while, then went to the ginger man, then back to Bronx to meet up with Angie and Angie's friend who I've never met before.  Didn't get her name either.  But Angie kinda flipped out about how she has no direction and doesnt' know what she's doing.  It was weird - I was drunk and was like, "ummm, nobody knows what they're gonna be doing in 5 years, so just relax."  Then I pitched the magazine idea on her and that got her thinkin - which definitely rules.  Because she could do a piece on Hong Kong.  And for some reason, I have her phone number now too - which is weird.  Regardless, I hope she calls - her family owns Miyako and Rickshaw - which are some pretty nice places.  And she's hot.  But babes don't go for the Null - only creepy chicks that are really opinionated.  And that doesn't help.    Saturday I didn't do crap.  I sat on my couch, saw Anchorman (ehhhhhh) and reminisced about how I wish I had every Will Ferrell sketch on video, because they all rule.  He was good in the movie, but nobody else was.  But what I wonder is this - are Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Ben Stiller, Will Ferrell and Jack Black like all best friends or something?  I know Stiller and Black are buddies, but what about the rest of them?  Or is this some dumbass dude club that only dudes like them are allowed into?  If so, I want none of that.    Anyway, I'm done - more later.  Ted  P.S.  We left Julia like 30 minutes of messages of me and Mike doing our worst Boston/Ted Kennedy accents.  I think she was NOT amused.

      Mike is sitting outside, reading his favorite book, "How to Boil Water - Volume II," while Julia runs in a mini-marathon sponsored by Vodka Crans.  Mike smiles, noting the absolute perfection of his living room rug, with its soft, cream color and beautifully textured surface.  No lines, no scuffs, no dirt - just perfectly manicured carpet.  As he's grooming his carpet with a fork and knife, Cory's shades snap open quickly on both sides of the window, the familiar pair of binoculars and cigarette appear.  However, on the other end are another pair of binoculars and another cigarette.  "Hmmppffff, apparently Craig has moved in," Mike says, catching the shades snapping closed in the reflection.  Julia bounds up the stairs, still wearing her marathon number (sponsored by Grey Goose).  She steps over Mike and walks into the kitchen.  J:  "Do we have any vodka?  I need a drink"  M:  "Babe, you just got done running a marathon, wouldn't you like a gatorade or some other sports beverage?  And have you forgotten that we take our shoes off before we walk on the carpet?" J:  "Forget that, I had to run through some guy's puke in the marathon.  I'm not touching these shoes."  Mike's face goes white as his head slowly pans down to see the puke tracks left on the carpet by Julia's running shoes.  At this moment, Dacus walks by with a pair of Blue Blockers on and snaps a picture.  M: [Frantically] "Where is the sponge and carpet cleaner?"  J:  "I think its in the drahhhhhh."  M:  "Now maybe you'll understand why we take our shoes off in the apartment"  J:  "What is this 'we' shit?"   Schilltron 3030 walks by, laundry detergent and bag of laundry in hand.  He stops to admire the carpet, and is disgusted when he sees the puke marks.  S:  "Mike, you should be ashamed...and now I'm going to do the robot."   Cory's blinds flip open again.  Mike's phone rings.   PHONE:  "A little club soda will get that right out.  Click."   Cory's blinds flip shut again.     P.S.  I just fell asleep at my desk for 10 minutes - and yesterday's episode was a tough act to follow, but my resolve will not waver...

      I just realized we're at t-minus 8 days until Ramey officially moves to Houston, so I thought it'd be fitting to fire up a little taste of what the best reality tv show in years will bring to the table.   EPISODE #1 - How'd this water get on the floor?  Mike enters scene from behind the camera, carrying his mail, wearing a pair of purple "Vietnam" pants and a shirt that says, "I ADOREGON."  Julia is sitting outside in the lounge area, reading "Dummy's Guide to Medieval British Literature...Now with translation into Middle English!"  MIKE:  "Hey babe, what's up?" JULIA:  "Nothing, just finishing up some Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. How was work?" MIKE:  "Work was cool, had to interview the main DJ at South Beach." JULIA:  "Oh, for a story?" MIKE:  "No, for Craig - he wanted me to get his number." JULIA:  "Ohhhhhh..." MIKE:  "Well, let me throw this stuff inside...did you want an uber-chic mineral tonic?" JULIA:  "No thanks, I've been drinking beers since noon."  Cut to shot of Cory's blinds, partially split by a pair of binoculars and a burning cigarette.  As Julia looks at the blinds, they snap close  quickly.  Mike walks back out of the apartment, eyes wild-eyed, holding a phone  book.  MIKE:  "Julia, did you just take a shower?" JULIA:  "Ummm, about two hours ago.  Why?" MIKE:  "Did you forget to bring down the instructions I gave you?" JULIA: "What instructions?" MIKE (raising his voice): "The ones I gave you on how to close the  goddammed shower curtain!" JULIA:  "What's your problem?" MIKE:  "No problem, except when there's water all over the floor of my bathroom." JULIA:  "Well Jesus, maybe if you'd turn the a/c on once in a while, I wouldn't have to take 3 cold showers a day!" MIKE:  "My way or the highway, Julia...get used to it." JULIA (mumbling): "Better get used to me kicking your ass..."  Cut to scene later that night.  Mike's bedroom door is closed, Mike is carrying pillow and blanket to couch in living room.  Mike walks up to blinds and closes them.  Last glimpse before blinds close is Julia,  throwing a shoe at Mike.   That was just a teaser of what's to come.  I'll be tryign to crank out one episode a day until the fateful day when she arrives folks!  Feel free to give me any comments....

      Wow, just flew in!  No, but seriously, I did just get in last night at midnight, and now I'm at work (woonnnnderful).  Anyway, upstate NY was wonderful weather-wise, and downright decent otherwise.  Checkmate....  So here's the rundown.    WEDNESDAY:  Airplane ride was decent from Houston to Cleveland, but I think I'm gonna start going with the window seats because I always freak out when those giant beverage carts come rattling through.  Yeesh, its like the mining car that Indiana had to use to escape from the Temple of Doom.  The flight from Cleveland to Rochester, however, was divine.  Nobody on the plane, beautiful skies and a fast tailwind.  It was weird coming into Rochester - I always get really disoriented in that airport.  Makes me kind of freak out.  Anyway, came outside, and there was Chazbo with his shit-eating grin and silver Isuzu.  And it was 64 DEGREES!!!!  It was 94 when I got on the plane.  I almost needed a sweatshirt!  So Chaz showed off his giant macerated leg that he got from sliding in softball (with shorts on).  God, what a dumbass.  Anyway, we went to get some drinks at a Sports Bar on Monroe, right by Jared's favorite bar, Acme.  The beer was cheap, flowed down my throat like Tahitian Treat, and wings were on the menu.  We destroyed 30, wrapped it up, and headed back into town.  Even weirder than coming into Rochester is coming into Canandaigua.  Everything is weird on 332 - the car dealerships, the new Topps (or somewhat new, rather), there's an Eckerd's going in, no more John & Bob's.  Good lord, I feel so old now.  But we went straight to the Temple, mostly because we needed some serious beers.  Which was good, because Wade gave them to us for free.  Then little Andy showed up looking like a stoned lacrosse player.  Bastard needs to cut his hair...Not much happened that night, besides drinking at the Temple, which was really good because now its really empty, unlike previous visits.  Ever since that Lumberbutthole opened, I think business has sank badly.    THURSDAY: So Chazbo had to work on Thursday, but the good news was that Krisy and Rich were up for some drinking.  But anyway, in the morning, I woke up and went for a run.  It was just around the VA once, but it felt good to be out doing something.  Oh, and I woke up at like 8:30 AM and wasn't even tired.  It was really weird, but I think the air in upstate NY makes me sleep solidly so I don't need a lot of sleep.   I got home and realized that we've got a new white-trash neighbor who's renting the house next to us.  I put him out of my mind, put on my aviators, and hopped on the Cub Cadet.  I mowed most of the yard, but the goddammed PTO belt popped off, and i didn't have a belt cinch to get the fucker back on.  What a bitch.  And then the John Deere pushmower wouldn't start for like 20 minutes.  I finally got it going though, so problem solved and the lawn looked really good.  And it wasn't hot at all, so it was nice to be outside.  Then I just sat on our rocking chair on the patio and watched the cars drive by.  Its simple pleasures like these that really make me happy.  Anyway, I went to the mall with my mom, and she kept trying to buy me shirts, but I told her "no" and then took her out to dinner.  Always fun taking the parents out to dinner.  When I got back into town, I decreed that I'd meet Krisy and Rich at the Temple.  Now I love Krisy to death, I really do, but sometimes she gets way too heavy on me.  Like she came right in and was really layin on the "I miss you guys so much" angle.  And its not bad, because I definitely miss her a lot too, but shit, the last thing I'm trying to do at home is be all nostalgic, and here she is throwing high school curves.  Then Rich showed up, looking like he was in a death metal band with his beard.  It was pretty funny.  Rich is a seriously weird dude, but he rules, and thats what rules about Rich (and weirdness).  Plus, little Parkhurst and some of his chums, notably Ben Rose, were at the Temple.  We all hung out and played pool until like 2 or so.  Then I drove home and passed out with the cool breeze blowing.    FRIDAY:   Friday again was good.  I woke up at 9:30, made some breakfast, then went for a run.  After the run, I watched "Intolerable Cruelty."  It was good, but the end was really predictable.  Reminded me of an "O Brother Where Art Though" in the world of LA divorce lawyers.  After that, I finally decided to take a shower, then I took Meg out to lunch at Koozina's.  Koozina's is crap now, finally, but one of the best restaurants in that butthole of a town.  Meg has chilled out  a   LOT .  I talked to her about getting back into school and working.  And her friends are actually a lot better than normal.  She floated the idea of Houston, and I quickly deferred to Uncle Charlie on that matter.  I think she and my mom would be a lot more compatible if they weren't around each other.  And it'd give Meg a healthy dose of responsibility if she was out on her own.  Of course, her friends may be questionable.  Anyway, after that lunch, I went home and watched Barbershop 2 - which was good, because I like black movies, but also kinda corny, like Next Friday.  Cube is a great actor though.  Then Charles called, he was on his way from Rochester to the marina and we were taking the boat out.  I got really excited at that point and fell down when I twisted my ankle.  But no breaks or swelling, so I was cool and the gang.  I made Meg drive me to German Brothers, and to Rank's, where I got a 12er of Coors Light (Chazzy's fave) and brought my day/beach bag.  We hopped on and sailed off for Kershaw.  We also had to do some maintenance on that piece of junk boat.  One of the lights didn't work, probably because the front is always taking on water, so we had to rewire the red front light.  Chaz basically just poked and prodded the thing for like 10 minutes before I hopped in, half having to pee and half wanting to fix the damned thing.  So i traced the wire from the source to point, figured out which wire was fucked (Chaz had the right one) and then clipped the bitches together.  It was a pain though, doing it when you're floating and gripping the pontoon with  your feet.  Not to mention, extremely unsafe - I don't think the lake was grounded.  But i was willing to risk it.  After that little foray, we headed over to the Sandbar for a Labatt's oilcan.  Dave, coming in from Cleveland (pony tail and all) met us there, as did his half-sister, Jen.  Jen is Chazzy's new playtoy, and she has the worst Rochester accent I've ever heard.  Makes me want to fart on a frog.  Anyway, we headed back down to German Brothers to seal up the boat and head out for the evening.  Again, of course, we went to the Temple.  Meder was working, and it was awesome to see him.  Big props to that guy, especially since I've been drinking there since I was 20.  The big deal though, was that Jaime was at the Temple.  I felt sort bad, because I kind of disappeared from everybody, but I got to really talk to her and basically address the fact that we do "it" every time I come home.  And then we talked about what's been going on, etc.  I walked her home (both Friday and Saturday) and everyone seems to think I hooked up with her.  I know I didn't, I didn't even feel compelled to.  But it was good talking to her both nights, and then I never called her the rest of the time home.  That was a weird night though, because I trounced through old towne CA for a few hours and got home around 5 AM.    SATURDAY:  Saturday was a tough one to wake up for.  I rolled out of bed around noon (finally) after both Drumm (at 10:31) and Charles (at 10:44) had called.  I was in pain.  Just rotted out from the amount of beers I'd consumed.  I started horsing the water and the advil and throwing a bunch of junk into my day bag (yes, my fucking day bag, alright, and it was a canvas sack).  It was crystal clear, beautiful, and just plain good.  So i threw on my swimsuit, slapped on some sunblock and had chazbo come and pick me up.  After dropping Chaz off to get his car, we went to Wegmans to get supplies for the day.  The list was as follows:  1.  Ribs 2.  Hot Dogs (Red and White) 3.  Buns 4.  3 Cases of Beer 5.  5 bags of ice  Somehow the whole bill added up to like 100 bucks.  I gave Chaz twenty and said good deal.  Anyway, we headed over to his parent's house out on Wyffels and fired up the grill.  Big John was out, mowing the lawn, and stopped to have a Coors Light with us.  Always a pleasure to see Big John - the man with the plan.  We threw some dogs on first and I prepped a rack of ribs.  Drumm, Chaz and I just chilled and then Rich, Dave and Wade all showed up.  It was a good crew, and the dogs were cooked, as were the ribs.  I got the big seal of approval from John for the ribs.  As most folks know, I only come up once a year to cook these ribs.  They're somewhat of a legend in the town of CA (and some how Serazio manages to eat them with a knife and fucking fork).  Anyway, we loaded up the coolers and headed on down to the German Brothers dock.  We loaded up, cracked some fresh beers, and headed out.  First, we went to Shenkman's cottage to pay homage to the wiffleball field and then gawk at the giant, ugly deck they had put in.  Surprisingly, Wade and Dave got a long the whole day - which was a wonderful blessing.  We ripped a bowl right in the cove by the cottage, and that got me feeling super-torqued.  Then we threw the giant in drive and took off for Kershaw.  We finally found Meder's boat and tied on.  They were close, but not attached, to Pennise and Masterson's boats.  It was blatantly obvious that there were probably 20 underage girls drinking on those boats, so slowly people started to migrate over to our little flotilla.  First Matt Wood, then Danny (who, with his shirt off, looks like an 80's drug kingpin worth of Miami Vice) and finally Ben Noble.  All the old men were on the party boat, not wanting to get arrested when the young girls got busted.  Then, out of nowhere, Christina O'Hara, in her Gucci sunglasses and hot yellow bikini, flew up and tied on to the other side of chaz's boat.  She looked great, as the pictures demonstrate (http://jessenull.fotopages.com) and Shannon and Melissa D. were also with her.  It was great to see all of them.  Not to mention, the Allman's "Blue Sky" was playing on their cd player when they pulled up, and I was in such a good mood that I took a mental picture of that moment.  It was absolutely perfect.  Except that even the SPF 30 shit wasn't keeping the sun from turning me into a lobster.  But I didn't care.  We hopped in the water and started tossing the old pigskin around.  Every time I threw it to wade, I'd intentionally throw it over his head.  Finally he swam back in, like a baby, and told me to get it.  I did, and then threw it at his head.  I'm sure it was the beer controlling me, but he can kiss my ass.  What a baby.  Oh, and we came up with a great chorus for a song, "Going back to the harrrr-boorrrr, whoaaaaah whoaah."   Wade claims he made it up, but Chaz was the one that remembered it, so I give him credit.  Just like Wade to steal all sorts of personal things from people.  After getting sufficiently burned/drunk at Kershaw, we decided to head up to the Boathouse to grab a bite to eat.  Turns out, we had a table for 16 and the Valedictorian of the Class of 1997 was our waitress, and she gave us a couple of cigarettes.  I tipped her 30% because she was awesome, and I really owed her for the smoke.  I also got to see Kate Lillis, who looks absolutely incredible, and was really happy about that.  Except that I didn't get her contact information, and that kind of bums me out.  Oh well, always Christmas.  But anyway, we wrapped it up after that and laid the good party boat to rest for the night.  This is where the night gets hazy to me, but after talking to several people, we came to the conclusion that we first went to the Lumberbutt(I think) where I sat in the car (I think), and then we went to the Temple (I think) and spent the rest of the night there (I think).  I do know that Chaz left his car at the Temple, and that he went to some afterhours place with Wade and Sarah J. out in the country, and that he was like, "I really need to get home now" and Wade took him home 3 hours later.  Poor Charles.  I also know that I walked Jaime home, with Drumm in front of me at one point, on his cell phone.  Damn, that was a late one too, somewhere in the vicinity of like 5 AM.  And Charles insisted that we go out on the boat for the 4th as well.    SUNDAY:  Sunday, the true celebration.  It was painful getting out of bed for that day.  I didn't make it up before noon, even though I was up at 9:30, laying in bed, staring at the fan.  I went to pick up Chaz, and we got his car.  Then we drove out to his place, grabbing Drummer on the way.  Everyone was in very rough shape, but it didn't matter, because it was a vacation.  and thats how its supposed to be.  We got to Charles house, and fired up the grill for the last 2 racks of ribs.  It was a motley crew this time again, with me, Charles, Rich, Kevin D., Kevin W., this girl Steph from Rochester, Mike Johnson (the infamous) and his friend Traci, as well as Dave's sister, Jen.  The sky was cloudy, and the sea was very choppy.  We had a hell of a time getting the boat out, even with Andy as captain and Chaz as first mate.  The wind was howling, the waves were crashing, and we were going as slow as balls.  We ventured back down towards Kershaw, attempting to find Tim Meder's boat once again.  Unfortunately, they had turned back, almost swamping their boat and giving up.  We fought slowly, stopping near the pier for everyone to jump in.  I jumped in, and swam to get a magic stick.  Unfortunately, the chop was killing me and the boat drifted far from the stick.  I got it though, and fought powerfully to make it back.  There's nothing scarier than thinking you won't make it back to a boat.  With every wave, it pushed further, and I had to push harder.  Christ, I was so tired by the time I got to the boat that i just hung off the front for almost a half hour.  Finally I got the energy to get up, and we were off again.  We headed into the pier to pick up Mike Johnson's girlfriend (?).  Only everyone decided to deboard while the boat drifted down and almost slammed into someone else's boat.  Then Rich, the absurd and extreme asshole, decides to buy a hot dog while we're about to go.  So I"m holding the back end of the boat to the fucking pier, and Rich walks, no, saunters back from the hot dog stand, just to be an asshole.  It was old Rich, coming through, the Rich that made me want to shoot him in the ass.  So we finally get out of the pier, which was extremely treacherous, and Krisy starts calling like every minute.  Of course, my phone is in my day bag, so I didn't hear it, but she called everyone else's phone on the boat.  She wanted us to meet her on the pier, but the waves were so bad we couldn't chance it.  Then we thought about trying ot get her at the Inn on the Lake, but we tied up there and it was terrible.  So much wind, and we kept drifting towards shore.  Finally, Andy planted us into the mud and we held.  It was at that point that Mr. Black pulled up in Pennise's boat.  I yelled "Ahoy Milloy!" to him, but he gave me the cold shoulder.  Black, for being the most prominent member of Canandaigua Academy's faculty, sure is an asshole.  I'll get him one day though, because I still have his cell phone number.  After a while, we started pulling out, and as we did, the cops told us that a giant storm was coming (as if we didn't know) and to get our asses back to the marina.  Well, by this time its whitecap country on the lake, with a good 3 foot chop.  So we have two options: to haul ass and take on a lot of water, or to slowfoot it and keep it drier.  Well, it didn't matter all that much, because Wade's friend Steph got completely soaked on the way back (all while Wade sat in the back of the boat, basically ignoring her).  At one point, we had to open the side doors to clear out the water that was piling up.  Finally, we pulled the boat in and got her all tied up.  Which was a huge relief.  It was at that point that we heard the fireworks were cancelled due to bad weather, so I guess it was good we got off the lake.  Then we just chilled at Chazzy's slip and drank a bunch of the beers we had.  Krisy also met us there, finally, and was nice enough to bring us more beers after we basically screwed her over.  I love just sitting by that slip, sucking down cold Labatt's.  I think it may be my favorite past-time.  After we were thoroughly drunk, we all headed up to Charles house and finished off the beer.  It was fun there, and Chaz and Jen were all over each other, and Drumm and Steph were talking, and Wade was being dumb (as usual).  I think we were so obnoxious that Mrs. Parkhurst had to leave the living room.  But hey, she's Mom of the Year, she can do whatever she wants.  Anyway, we started figuring out what we were gonna do.  Jen, annoyingly, kept screaming that we should all just go up to her apartment in Victor, but I was definitely anti-Victor at that point (although Chaz was all for it).  Someone threw out the Lumberyard, and I denied it.  We finally decided on MacGregor's, although part of us went to the Lumberyard.  Chaz and Jen met us at MacGregor's for a drink, and then disappeared, probably to Victor.  So we just hung there, me, Drumm, Wade, Rich, Sarah J., Missy, Krisy and Steph.  And this is where it gets good.  But first, a quick backgrounder:    People who have hooked up with girls that Wade likes (while he likes them):  1.  Me (Kate Lillis) 2.  Josh (Kate Lillis) 3.  Jared (Charlotte Olefinetical) and now... 3.  Drumm (Steph)  So anyway, we go to some sketchy ass party out on middle cheshire road.  I go there to hang with Sarah J. for a little while.  But the creepy thing was that while i was there, like everyone kept talking to me, trying to elbow out the other (i.e., Sarah J., Missy and some other girl that I didn't know).  I got all bugged out, and had a beer while I stayed out of the way.  Wade got some beer called Bernt or something, and it was nasty shit.  Somehow, he always manages to buy expensive, nasty beer, but he thinks its good, because he bought it.  So this place has a camper, and people are hanging out in it.  I passed, thankfully, and sat on the deck.  The mosquitos, however, were pretty randy that night, and I've got a ton of bites all over my hands.  What a bunch of bastards.  The most important thing that happened that night was huge...Drumm made out with Steph.  Steph, ironicaly, was brought by Wade, because he liked her.  But i think she figured out he's a dick when he totally gave her the cold diss on the boat.  Drumm, being the spry gentleman he is, totally jumped all over it.  She was hot, no lie, and Drumm made a good move.  But its tricky business, avoiding Wade when you're hooking it with a girl he likes.  I tried to run interference, oh how I did, but I think he managed to catch them making out on the couch at some point.  Wade got pissed at that point.  And then got even more pissed when he called josh on his cell phone, and I called Josh, and josh hung up with Wade to talk to me.  Just the powers of persuasion I guess....So Wade was doubly pissed, plus Krisy kept fucking whining that she was tired.  And I understand that, but cripes, what could you do.  Wade was her ride, and that sucks.  I just would hate to be Steph, having to ride back to Rochestere with Wade after smooching with Drumm (obviously the better choice here).  At that point, Rich decided to light off some fucking fireworks.  Christ, Rich has to be retarded, plus he was drunk, so if a cop caught him, he'd be in jail - simple as that.  And so we leave, but I was kind of pissed, because Missy is a cool chick (and no, i'm not attracted to her) but I do need a contact in Japan if I ever do end up over there.  Oh well, I've always got Serazio for that.  Anyway, so me, Drumm and Missy pile into Rich's car.  First off, he's sucking on a beer, and second, he just starts running lights.  It was a one-way ticket to a DWI, especially on the 4th of July.  We got real lucky that he didn't get busted.  At one point, the dumbass must've realized that having a beer in the car wasn't good, so he basically hands drumm the beer and says to throw it, but not on the ground, in the grass so it doesn't break.  What a fucking dumbass.  So by this time, Drumm and I are flipping out, hoping to god we get home ok.  He gets to Missy's house, and then to my house, and Drumm and I swear to never ride with rich again.  Not only is he chronically late, but he's a terrible driver.  Good lord, and he keeps you on the phone for like 2 hours when its a 5 minute conversation.  what a pain in the ass.  Finally, finally, finally, I get home and its like 5 am.  AT this point, I say fuck it and I'm done.  Absolutely done.  No more.    MONDAY:  Monday was an easy day.  I hung around the house all day, did little chores, helped mom with things.  Dave stopped by in his corvette to say goodbye and god speed.  I gave him a big hug - I was so happy to see Dave, and he looks like he's doing very well.  I missed Drummer, and I was pretty bummed about that, but I'll see him soon enough in New Orleans.  Lutwin came to Canandaigua, which is rare.  But it was so awesome to see him.  He's so happy with this girl he's seeing now, and he looks like he's got his optimism back.  We just hung out and talked about everything for like 4 hours, then had dinner at my place (that my mom cooked) and rapped a little more.  He had to get back to cuse though, to see his girl.  I didn't mind - its not like I was doing anything.  After that, Rich called to go see Fahrenheit 9/11.  I'm not gonna sit here and go political, that's for another entry, but I like three things - the beginning with all black, the shot of Wolfowitz spitting on his comb, and Ashcroft singing.  What a bunch of freaks.  After that, I gave Rich the parting handshake and told him I'd see him in New Orleans, but I don't think it registered with him.  Oh well, I'll see him in a month.  I went to bed superearly on Monday, because I was dead.    TUESDAY:  The big day, the day for my exit strategy to be demonstrated.  There wasn't much to say, besides watching tv, tracking down my Dreamcast, cleaning my tennis rackets, and packing my bag.  I gave my mom a huge hug and Brad gave me a lift to the airport.  The flight was ok, except for these young boys that were like bouncing around in their seats.  The guy behind me told them they needed to shape up before they got on their next plane.  I agreed, in theory, but silently read my latest edition of the Economist.  Mikey picked me up around 11, we rapped about our respective trips.  Always good to talk to Mikey, especially when unpacking everything that happened on the trip.  Sounds like he had a great trip up to NYC, and is doubly excited that his girlfriend is moving down here in about a week.  I'm writing a series of brief episode plots regarding the first 2 weeks of them living together.  Its going to rule.  Craig is gonna move in for that period and we're gonna record at all times, just to witness the hilarity first-hand.    Anyway, that was the week - post your comments if you want.  By the way, Jared, I'm sending this on to Mike - its only fair, and probably to Drumm, so I can get some comments for once...  Thats all for now...  Peaches Joyale

      I am officially addicted to Creedence.  My favorite song is "Cotton Fields," with "The Midnight Special" a close second.  My God - I rocked out for like 2 hours last night, just downloading and rocking.  But, my rocking inadvertently saved me from Schilling's hullaballoo with Vanessa (GroomMama), which he is none too pleased about today.   So the BV is officially in turmoil.  Everyone hates everyone else, and I'm taking the Swiss stance and staying the fuck out of it all.  Of course, everyone is pressuring me to come back out, probably in hopes of me somehow burying all the hatchets that are dripping with blood.  Courtney officially has disappeared and thinks I don't like her anymore, which is ridiculous.  I think its safe to say that everyone hates Vanessa, save Dacus.  Its a bad mix out there - no wonder Lee doesn't come around anymore.   So here's two solutions, and both are pretty drastic.  Either a.  we (being the keepers of the lounge) move to a different common area, far away from GroomAnnoying and Dirty Dacus.  Or, we just start putting invitations on Enfreakay's door and have him come up and clear out the party.  Which I think is the smarter move, quite honestly, sort of like scaring off the whole bunch, then rebuilding.  Either way though, it sucks, and its super-annoying.   And we've got two new neighbors, and I'm hoping to give them as good an introduction as I received when I first moved in, but with all this bullshit going around, its gonna be a pain in the ass.   Good news though, Missy is sending me a package from Japan, and that rules most supremely...  Anyway, probably another post this afternoon...  Ted

      The official song of my magazine (Where) will be "Rocket" by the Smashing Pumpkins, as it provides a clear corporate vision for where I want this publication to go to.   Does anybody know how to actually start a company?  I can do the sales pitch, thats not a problem, but damn, the logistics and technicalities of it all are daunting...  So I've received yet another question on "Who's the redhead?" and thus, I feel as if I should justify just exactly what the situation between myself and Ms. Corliss is.  But not today, ass monkeys, because I'm too busy rocking out proper!

      Post Partum Canteen Syndrome - Just reflecting on the events of the past few weeks.  Still hooked on CCR, still hooked on the Postal Service.  Man, I'm a weird dude, especially 7 cuba libres into the night...  Weird weekend, weird world, good quote:  "My greatest fear is that when they finally turn to love, we will have turned to hate," Kumalo,  Cry, The Beloved Country .  I'll address the question of PJ sometime this week - not to worry, my 4 faithful readers...  Peculiar - I feel like I'm addressing a corporate convention.  I need this magazine to become a reality...  Not much else, I entered a picture of Jared in the achewood.com photo contest.  Its so blurry, i'm sure Onstad will reject it (Ansel Adams Apologist - chew on that alliteration, bitches!)  Ashley Goble once cheated in 6th grade on a spelling bee - she wrote the word, "Onomatopoeia" on her hand.  Needless to say, she had giant hands, even back then.  And her dad charged like a $3000 tip to his credit card.  But, interestingly, it wasn't at a strip club, it was at fucking Rocky's...  All right, the booze marathon has finally lapped me, but i'll leave you with this thought - dog names...

      I think its time for me to go remarkably silent for a while.  All this communication between myself and my friends is extremely tiring.  I mean, obviously I'll still talk to Jared on IM, and Mike, Craig, Schilling and Julia.  But as for the rest of the folks, just leave me a message, maybe I'll reply with an email, but I'm finally upon the time where I need to reconsider what happened last weekend....

      So after the whole weekend, PJ and I got back to Houston on Sunday evening and stayed at my uncle's.  It was weird, mostly because I was working on extreme exhaustion.  Here's a rundown:  Monday:  Went to work - work blows, especially when you're tired.  Got back to Uncle C's at like 5:30, went to dinner with Heather (so someone could prove that PJ was in town) at Pappasito's and ate way too much.  It was fun, but I wasn't in the mood, plus, I was looking forward to calling in sick on Tuesday.  We hung at the BV for a little while, but the whack pack is a bit too much for me, especially with friends in town.  Went back to the house and went to bed.  Tuesday:  Big interview with Pharm-Olam - the interview went well.  After that PJ and I went shopping at the Galleria and had a late lunch at the Cheesecake Factory.  It was fun - and I got an unlined new tan jacket, which I was super-excited about, because it was on sale for only 100 bucks.  Which sounds steep, but it wasn't.  After that, we had drinks at the BV, then headed over to the Marquis II, and PJ and I were amazed at how many of the people there reminded us of St. Lawrence people.  It was actually quite freakish.  After that, we headed back to Uncle C's and passed out.   Wednesday:  Went ot work early and hungover.  At noon, picked up PJ, ran her up to the airport, gave her a lackluster hug goodbye.  Then flew back to work (I took a 2 hour lunch that day).  After work, I had to fly back up to the airport to pick up my uncle from P-town.  Had dinner at Teotihuacan (on Uncle C) and went home and crashed hardcore.  It finally hit me, right after I got the last person out of Houston.  Good lord...  Thursday:  Exhausted, got 12 hours of sleep.  Went to work exhausted.  Work sucked.  Played tennis with Julia, which ruled, even though it was 1000 degrees outside.  Went out to dinner at Star to send Mike off to his family reunion.  Had one rum and coke, passed the fuck out.   Friday:  Still to be said, but so far, I've done nothing at work and had Zydeco for lunch.  Shaping up to be a good night too - have some party at Kathy's, which should be interesting.  Especially if we bring Dacus...  More after the break,  Ted "I thought this was a party" Kennedy

      Sunday was a very painful day for me...but also very satisfying in a way.   I woke up at about 9 AM to take Rich to the airport, as his flight left around 10:30.  I was sad to see Rich go, as he genuinely had a good time and thanked me properly for it.  I think it was at that time that I was the happiest.   After that, I got back to the hotel room and went into crazy "Check Out from the Hotel" mode - taking a shower, cleaning the whole dungeon up, etc.  I thought we had to be out by 11 am, but we didn't have to leave until noon, which was nice.  PJ and Drumm went off to go shopping, i.e., make out probably, but whatever.  So I just basically cleaned myself up and tuned everyone out.  Wade didn't shower, and he smelled like someone left a crab bisque out for a week in the Everglades.   So everyone had gotten up and cleaned up the clutter, which was good.  The car valet had been paid for, so Jared, Charlotte, John and I went to get some Dunkin' Donuts down the street.  It was good to have some sweet, bad food in my stomach, although only a bit better than having a bag full of tacks in there.  Then we just hung out in the room until everyone's shuttle came at 12:30 PM.  Part of me was sad to leave, part of me was ready to get rid of everyone there.  Sadly, I can only handle being around my friends for a very succinct amount of time before everyone gets on my nerves.  SIDENOTE:  Dave came in wearing just a blanket - I don't know what happened, but I believe Krisy was naked as well.  I'm not making any judgments, but any children conceived at the Canteen have to be named after the Executive Committe, in this case, Louis Walton Corbin Barry.   So we wrapped it up, after saying "Meaalll Beellllll Muelllll" a few times and handing out hugs and handshakes to everyone.  It was a bummer to see them load onto the shuttle and head for the airport, but also relieving.  I also learned that Dave brought pot on the plane with him, which is dumb.  And I wouldn' be surprised if Drumm did it too...  Anyway, everyone got home alright, and PJ and Schilling passed out the moment I got onto the Basin Bridge that runs into New Orleans.  It was a fitting departure, at least for me, psychologically.  I listened to Creedence, I checked out the Bayou, and reflected on the weekend.   It was a long slog home, but really sunny for most of it.  It started to rain between Lafayette and Lake Charles, but I knew to slow down and take it easy.  I also bought a tin of Cherry Skoal to keep me awake.  My car already smelled like sweat and feet, so I didn't want to add cigarette smoke to it too.  Oh!  We saw a car totally spin out in the rain too when we had just gotten to Lake Charles.  It was awesome, and the guy was really lucky.  PJ and John would come in and out of sleep every now and then, but no good conversations.  Had I been a little more rested, I would've preferred it that way, so I could just delve into my brain and think.  As you can tell, I'm very introverted and like to be in my own head most of the time.   We got into Houston around 6 PM and I dropped off John, picked up some clothes, and headed straight to my uncle's house.  I was in the mood to rest and sit on the couch with my babies - Abigail and Nowell.  They were happy to see me, and I passed out cold at 10 am with those two in the bed.  I woke up nearly crushing Abigail, but she didn't seem to mind, which was actually quite funny.    So that's it, the big Canteen weekend - any comments or questions, throw them up on the board and I'll address them...  Stay Well,  P. Dansfield III

      I woke up very angry on Saturday, angry for a lot of reasons, actually. First and foremost was the previous night's problem with Wade, and the fact that we had a complaint against our room. I guess some of these idiots just don't get it, that if indeed we get room charges against us, it goes on my credit, not theirs. I think thats what really gets my goat. I was also pissed because I knew someone had fucking coke the night before, and that shit does not fly on my watch. Not that I give a shit what other people are doing, but something like that is not something to fuck around with. And since PJ and Drumm stayed up all night, I figured it was the old culprit. I guess I was partially disappointed that Drumm had done it, mostly because it was exactly that shit that fucked him up in college.  Anyway, I need beignets and I wanted to walk. Unfortunately, Drumm was just coming up, so he tagged along. I really wish I was by myself, so I could just let everything diffuse out of me, but no such luck. The beignets were great, I stunk to high hell, and Drumm wanted to go to an Urban Outfitters. Not to be a style-Nazi, but I think Urban Outfitters is the downfall of society and responsible for evil trends such as trucker hats and funny t-shirts. and Drumm is like the epitome of a metrosexual, boston flavor. thats part of the reason i still think he's bumping candy, which i talked to dave about, but now i'm not worrying about, because its not my life.  the best part of the day was getting rich a XXXL shirt that he'd been talking about the night before. We wanted this one with all these kittens in like masks, and on the back it had their backs and buttholes, but that one only came in XXL. The XXXL one we found was some stupid crawfish t-shirt, but it was knee-length and thats what mattered.  we got back to the hotel, and presented Rich with his absolutely awesome t-shirt. Then, when Wade started trying to recount the night, I yelled at him for being a dumbass and forgetting his room key, also mentioning that we got a room complaint, compliments of his behavior. of course, he won't take responsibility, which i've come to expect, so i let it go. let it be known though, next year, my room will have myself and my date in it, for i will most certainly be bringing a date next year, just to avoid the situation of having anybody else in my room. not to mention, i may stay at a completely different hotel to avoid any incidents at all.  Charlotte was really sick that day from the night before, so I feel really bad that they didn't get to go on our next adventure, the Garden District, via Streetcar. It was fun, except the Streetcar lady kept yelling at us to pay up, etc and she was super-freaky. and loud. best combination of a woman = large + loud + black - makes for an interesting day. it was hot again, and we got off at Washington st. to check out some cemetary. We brought the bullhorn too, which I knew could turn into serious trouble if Wade and Rich just begin to blatantly disregard people around them, which is their specialty.  Charles and Krisy headed back to the hotel because they were hot/tired/hungry or something like that. sometimes Krisy can be really annoying. and this was one of those times where everyone looked at me like a fucking tour guide. god i was pissed, so i said, "do whatever you want!" and started to walk towards the opposite direction. its like the retards don't want direction until there's some sort of dissent in the group. what a headache!  So instead of walking around a cemetary, we hid on Wade and he sort of bought it. The residents of that area looked absolutely confused/pissed that we were fucking around in their neighborhood, but whatever. Then, we turned on the camera, gave rich the bullhorn, and started shooting a weird little clip about a photo shoot. god it was hilarious, especially with rich barking out orders in a super-long t-shirt, holding a half-eaten sub from subway in his hand. the footage will be up soon, probably on  urlLink www.allwomenaredead.com , so keep your eyes open for it.  after that, we just walked around from house to house, remarking about how beautiful they all were. we ended up at a starbucks because everyone needed some sort of refreshment. after cooling off/resting for a while, it started to rain outside, and not just rain, i mean deluge, monsoon-style rain. so josh, dave and sarah started dancing in it, which was funny. we got some great shots of it. at one point, a flash of lightning hit, and josh freaked, then the thunder hit and he ran back under the awning. it was so funny! good thing we got it on tape!  anyway, after that, we all regrouped, grabbed a bunch of garbage bags for ponchos, and began the slow trudge back to the trolley line, all the while with rich yelling "Beellllll buaaall llll billlll" and "Save Union Jobs" out of the bullhorn. Christ, that thing rules, but when its in Rich's hand, not in Wade's hand. So we all loaded up on the trolley and headed back to the hotel for our final dinner.  well, in the meantime, i guess Jared, Charlotte and Charles went and had a few beers, and some food somewhere around the hotel. I was glad to see everyone was up and about.  so, after an arduous trolley ride, where the thing stopped a bunch of times, we finally got back. not after wade had a funny encounter with some little girl - which was awesome! anyway, we got back and showered up for dinner. dinner that night was at the Crescent City Brewery. I had on a nice white polo with a beautiful pair of Madras pants. I wish I had a blue blazer, but I wasn't too concerned about all that - it was way too hot.  So we all walked down to the restaurant, only they didn't have the reservation, even though Jared made it like a month ago and gave them his credit card! i hope he checked the credit card! but anyway, i was pissed, so i walked to the next place, asked if they could take 12 people (they said yes) and started directing everyone that way. Then, magically (wink wink) the original place had a space that opened up. What a bunch of shit - I was so mad. And so was Jared, only he was like Silent Mad, which is when Jared becomes scary rock god mad. It was pretty funny, I'm glad someone else was mad besides me...  Dinner was awesome - the stuffed porkchop was great, the ribs were tasty, and those cheddar chipotle potatoes rule supremely. creamed spinach - ehhhhhh... In classic form, we fanned out the check to make it look beautifully, and it did (check the pictures at  urlLink http://jessenull.fotopages.com ).  After dinner, we headed up next to the Old Miss, the Old Man himself, for a little something that Jared and I had prepared.  It was great - Friendship Jeopardy had finally reared its ugly head, and I was so excited!  I think it was great, and there's no question Charles was the winner of the match.  I wish we'd gotten a lot more participation, but whatever, the enthusiasm was excellent.   After that, we dove into one of those hurricane huts that was pretty much empty.  we picked up a couple of huge beers and spread out in the back to relax and digest.  it was really quiet, so we decided to use it as our speech hall.  now, i'm not one to toot my horn, but my speeches are very corporate, direct and visionary in style.  but Sarah J's speech was one of the best I've heard in years.  Wade's was good too, especially since he acknowledged that we'll never let him do anything to help with the canteen.  We stayed eerily quiet about the induction of Dave into the Canteen Executive Committee (as a junior member).  My speech was off the cuff, I had to improvise because I left the copy down in my car.  It was cool though, I think mine was fun.  Usually, I end it, but I guess Drumm and Charles had other thoughts.  Charles was great because he got caught up and just yelled "Goulet!"   After that, we just fanned out on the strip near Frenchman Esplanade and just sort of did our own thing.  I went to my favorite reggae bar, and they were playing my favorite song by the Scientist, but everyone got corralled outside for apparently no reason.  It was late though, and we were a ways from the hotel, so I concurred.  Except that Rich told us to leave him.  So we did and went to the bar that Josh, Sarah and KW were at.  I hated that bar - too many people trying to be 80's freaks.  Annoying.  So I walked out and went to an open bar that was empty.  There was my home base, and I sat down, and got a gin and tonic.  I was not about to let others have all the fun - I needed to get drunk and let loose.  I put some tunes into the jukebox and just set up shop.  PJ was on her own, but I"m sure Dave and Drumm could shadow her like shadows.  I didn't want to have a conversation, I didn't want anything but to reflect and think forward.  Lots of thoughts, mostly about where the hell I was.  The Canteen always forces me to put myself in perspective.  It drives me batty.  But whatever, I left that bar, mostly because Rich didn't know when he flew out on Sunday and I was super-tired.  So we got back, looked up his info., rocked out to the Postal Service for a bit, and then I passed out.  I was so fucking tired.  I heard everybody else headed to the Hustler club.  Good luck and god speed, but I had to wake up in 5 hours to take Rich to the airport.  What a pain in the ass.   Meeaaauuulllll Biaaalllllllll Huuuuaaaaaahhhhh!!!!!!!  Cory      Hold the phone, I just got a message from Charles Evans - he's back in Houston!

      So let me just say real quick that I didn't get more than 3-4 hours of sleep per day, so there's always the background of impending exhaustion in all of these tales...  Anyway, Friday I got a wake-up call at about 9 AM, so I geared up, took a shower and went and picked up PJ from the airport. It was weird though, I stopped before I got to the airport to smoke a cigarette and watch the planes come in. I actually think I saw hers! These quiet moments were the only ones I got in NO, which was nice, because I really needed them after dealing with absolute insanity for 4 days.  Anyway, I picked her up and we flew back into town to drop her stuff off and get some breakfast. PJ looked great - seeing that I haven't seen her in 2 years. After a quick spoon with a sleeping Rich, everyone got up and headed down to some diner for breakfast. I gotta say, breakfast was great - and I got to hold hands while sharing some pancakes with Josh. Which was doubly awesome.  Did I mention it was a cloudy, absolutely sweltering day that day? But it didn't feel like it at first. The heat was incredible, but I'm so conditioned to it now that I just sweat it out onto my back and keep on trucking. Everyone else though, I think they were hurting...  Anyway, everyone went around - Josh, Dave, Rich and Wade did some bit in some art store. We went into the quarter, stopped at a bar, had a beer, and just worked our way towards the riverboats/central square area. Sarah wanted to go to some bookstore, so we finally got everyone into the main square and just hung around. I gave a quick history lesson on General Andrew Jackson, until Wade started asking really stupid questions and I just blew outta there. It was fun though, because like 10 of us just screwed around and acted all dumb. We finally ended up at some corner store bar that was tucked back in an alley, next to the infamous book store that Sarah was looking for. It was cool, just hanging out, yacking with the bartender, who definitely wasn't a local because she had a kansas meets mississippi accent. and she played the accent up too much, because she knew she didn't have it. wade had some bad impersonation of an absinthe drink (you can't sell real absinthe in the U.S.) and i think it got him absolutely shit-boxed. Krisy kept asking for a mojito, which got really frikkin old after a while...No offense, but at that point, I just wanted to disappear into the city, into my head, and get my shit together. I think I committed a cardinal sin upon my soul in New Orleans, I allowed all my friends into a city that I consider sacrosanct. Whenever I go to New Orleans, its always been a bit of a purging of the evils of Houston (ironic, seeing how many evils there are in NO as well), but its more a spiritual experience (not to get all new age). But trying to coordinate everyone, and worrying about other stuff, rather than just taking in the absolute serenity of it all was wrong. Then again, it's hard-pressed to do that when you have 11 other guests in a city they've never been to, not to mention, you kind of put the damned thing together (along with mucho assistance from Jared, and Beau Bridges). I think thats when my irritation started...  In between walking and dinner, I picked up Drumm from the airport. Again, we were almost hit by a car turning into our lane while not looking. God, that was the 2nd time, and it absolutely freaked me out...  After walking in the French Quarter all day, we headed back to the hotel to rest up and shower for dinner. We went to dinner at some place called "French Corner Market" or something like that, down on Decatur, damn near the Frenchman Esplanade area. The jambalaya there was shit, but they served Dixie beer, my favorite in the world, and it had a balcony that could seat like 12 people. We overlooked a jazz band for a while, but not a long while. After dinner, we made our way to Pat O'Brien's, home of world famous hurricanes (charles bought like 20 bags of the mix) for a round on my uncle's amex. He insisted, which was awesome, except that I spilled mine, but no worries, Kevin gave me his, and they brought me a new one! It was awesome! So we downed those things and just got absolutely wasted.  So part of the people headed out into the hedonism of bourbon street (drumm being one of them) and just proceeded to get absolutely wasted. We corralled them to start heading back to Jean Lafitte's, as PJ and Drumm wanted to go there and relax. Drumm started buying shots, which was very worrying. See, the thing that worries me about Drumm is that he has an addictive personality, so when he starts boozing hardcore, not only does he hemorrhage a ton of cash, but it can (and many times does) lead him to do harder things. Anyway, we drank there for a while, then stopped at a pizza/beer/daiquiri store and danced to some rockin' early 90's tunes, which was awesome. After that, everyone wanted another drink, and Chaz wanted up on some balcony bar, so we did that. I got cornered by some shot girl (who touched my butt 3 times by the way) and i did a few shots with her. That sucked, sorta, except that the shots were superweak. Chazzy did a couple too, which made me happy. I went inside and some other girl tried to corner me with shots and I was like, "do i have to pay for your cellulite on your legs too?" and she walked away. I think she got really pissed, but I was drunk, so I didn't care...  The rest of that night is a bit of a haze. I headed home because I was exhausted, and I think Chaz may have been with me. But i got back there and passed out. Then I remember everyone coming in at like 6 am, all loud and yelling. I passed back out. The next time I woke up, Wade was outside with the hotel manager and hotel security. I didn't know what the hell happened - I was asleep, but apparently we got complaints from all the people on the floor (thanks Wade) because of yelling and someone kicking on a door. That pissed me off super-hardcore, but I went back to bed, slept next to Charles butt-to-butt, and noticed that PJ &amp; Drumm were not present, but the bathroom door was closed. Ahhh, I should've known. This is why I'll never marry her...  So think about all that,  Cheers,  Cory

      So, I'm gonna break this down and recap only one day of the Canteen at a time. That way, it'll be easier to digest....  Thursday: By far, Thursday was the most difficult day to get through, even though I only worked a half day. It was weird, like totally weird. I threw Schilling in the car and took off, flying as fast as possible towards New Orleans. It was a decent day, except some thunderstorms around Lafayette. We were almost crushed by a U-Haul towing a car in the middle of a thunderstorm. Either their wipers didn't work, or they just weren't looking, but jesus, this guy cut in front of me and nearly hit me. It scared the shit out of me, but i let off the gas, got on the horn and held the wheel for dear life. Not to mention, Louisiana isn't too good about providing shoulders for cars, so I was rocking it on the rumble strips for about a minute while that fuckhead got into my lane. And then, when I caught up to him in better weather, he didn't eve acknowledge that he did anything. Of course, I wouldnt' either, but I'd also hope that the person I cut off didn't have road rage as bad as myself. What a dick...  After that, it was pretty smooth sailing, we'd pick up Rich and Dave at the airport around 6 (since Dave missed his first flight - how can you confuse Cleveland and Akron airports?) and Sarah J. had already successfully checked into one of the rooms. We finally got to the airport, threw those two in the back and headed to the hotel. The hotel was nice (Royal St. Charles) and really close to Bourbon Street. After everyone had settled in, we just walked around the French Quarter in search of dinner. We found a creole restaurant right off of Jackson Square and hit it up. The first wave of people was really chill - Schilling, Me, Rich, Dave, Sarah J. It was really nice - easing our way into the night. After dinner, I let them go and headed back to the car to pick up the next wave. Well, they were almost an hour late, so I just kept driving in a circle around the NO airport because they wouldn't let you park. Man, I was so pissed about that. So they finally get in and I throw them all into car, fly off for the hotel, unload them and meet up with everyone that got into town. Then I sent them all in the direction of Bourbon Street and hopped back in the car (again) to pick up Josh, the final person on the night.  So Josh and I make our way down Bourbon St., half trying to find everyone, half trying to avoid everyone. We curl up in a small jazz club past all the hubbub of Bourbon, and damn near Jean Lafitte's, my favorite bar in NO. We sat by the window, and I called Jared to alert him to our position.  Well, slowly but surely, everyone begins to migrate towards us, and we all head over to Jean Lafitte's, grab a table in the back, and sing a long for hours with the piano player. He was a shitty piano player though, because he didn't take any fucking requests. The other dude does, but I didn't know who this douchebag was. Anyway, we hung there for a very long time, just yackin and talkin'. After that, we fake-fought outside (me and charles vs. wade and josh) and wade tied charles up somehow, so i came up behind him and half-nelsonned him and stuffed his face into chazzy's junk.  well, josh hopped on my back, so it was a 4-way clusterfuck outside the bar.  but we swore to end the fight later...  So we decided to move on, back into the evilness that is Bourbon Street.  I think we ended up at some dance club where everyone just sort of disappeared.  Dave was macking it on some 40-year-old, I had a Coors Light, and most folks were down on the dance floor, getting mad rutty.  I hung back - I hate dancing and I hate dance clubs.  This club was exactly what was wrong with New Orleans - blatant, commercial hedonism.  But whatever, not my problem.  So we left there and headed out onto the street again.  Judging by my pictures, I think we headed back to the hotel after this (around 5 am).  But kevin did find some sweet pumps on the street and was modelling them.  Oh, and we had a terrible piece of pizza.  Do yourself a favor and get a lucky dog, because New Orleans pizza is the worst in the country, and I should know, I'm from Houston.   Back at the hotel was the fun part.  We all went back and forth between our rooms (405 and 408).  Schilling had been lost, but later called and said he was hanging with townies (sweet!).  At one point though, Kevin was jumping on the bed and tried to bulldog Charles.  Well, drunken Charles stepped to the side and tossed KW into the wall.  It was hilarious.  Then he got the crazy eye and started coming after me.  I laughed, because I'd been waiting to drunk-whoop wade for years.  I never realized how light wade was.  I easily hooked him into a full nelson and stuffed his head between the headboard and the mattress and held him there for like 5 minutes.  Well, he escaped over to the other bed, so i pounced like an angry leopard, tied him up in a bit of a figure 4, only to gain leverage, i put my feet up on the wall and went for the 2nd pin.  Somehow, again, he escaped, so i jimmied him on the other bed (again) and got him in the small package and just started cinching tighter and tighter and he started screaming.  it was awesome, but nobody came in to confirm the pin.  Finally, people came in and he was on the floor, so i sat on his back and tied his legs up until he tapped out.  What an amazing win!  felt great!  VINDICATION!  Thats it for thursday,  Cory
