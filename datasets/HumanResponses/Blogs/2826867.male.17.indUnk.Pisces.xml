      I hope that Microsoft funds (but not manages) a private spaceflight organization that will work on colonization.  It would be so cool.  Do you think we ever actually got to the moon though?  Hmmm...

      The first private spaceflight!  And just when I'm about to switch the theme from space to dinosaurs.  Wow, even though I hate Microsoft, it's still pretty dope.  From what I've heard, the pilot lost control, but used backup systems to regain it.  This is pretty exciting...  Maybe we'll be able to visit hotels on the moon soon.  I am slightly worried that our governments will try to take control of other planets/the moon and will not allow for private settling, which is becoming more and more possible.  Oh well, dinosaurs are better.   Vs.   The other day coming home from the wedding... the sun was in my eyes, the garage door opener fell down, and an eyelash fell in my eye so I couldn't see, and it hurt, not that this is a run-on sentence or anything, and the road was curvy, and I ran over the curb, and the hubcap fell off!!!!!!!  Too bad.  Winner?

        urlLink playlistId=5365125&selectedItemId=5365109">The Bad Plus - Stacks of Cash    So yesterday me and Miguel Hurtado and Chris Smith went down to the Dakota after practicing for the gig today.  Doug Little's quartet was playing and we sat in this small, stupid annoying little booth thingy. Wow, all of the sudden, this random dude comes up like "Hi, I'm blank!  Can I sit with you?"  He smelled bad, and was drunk.  Hmmm.  It was uncomfortable as hell might be if you are going there.  I had to be in the middle.  It was wack.  Wack Attack.  The show was cool though and the waitress was soooo hot.  We left random stuff in the check book thing.  Chris left his permit in there.  I wonder if she will send it to him.  But today, we played at a wedding and got paid alright.  65 each for an hour.  The food was somewhat wedding like, which was ok I guess.  I am excited for the gig I have coming up on July 9th.  It will be tight.  Here's a question:  What would you do if you saw Berit Ulseth and Owen Nelson together.  Like "couldn't keep their hands off of eachother" together.   Together.   I personally feel that it would be quite awkward.  Chris said he would cry.  Miguel said he would also cry.  I might cry too.  Is it the age difference?  What is it?  I don't know?!  I really don't!  I think that I'm done now.  Here is a new project of mine.  I'm making a dinosaur animation.  It'll be dope.   urlLink Click here to see the progress of this so called "dinosaur."  By the way, I am thinking of changing this theme to something having to do with dinosaurs...   Space got old really fast.    urlLink Ludacris - Hoes In My Room

      There isn't really much to talk about except for the ideas that are  manifested through the random things that I will be putting on here.  I have been trying to figure out an easy way to post and I've done it  probably:  This post is coming from an email!  Wow.  For real though  that "Who's Who" thing is real.  I have until July 7 to send in my  biography and it will be put in the book!  I makes me feel like I am  worth something.  Wow, thanks who's who of america.
