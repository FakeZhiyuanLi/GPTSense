       There.  I've decided to finally move my blog from  urlLink  my old journal   to here in an effort to get myself into an easier (and customizable) format.  Now all I have to do is learn a little more HTML  ----  Anyway, watch this space everyone! :)  There'll be a ton of layout bloopers, but at least the reading will be worth it. ;)  Catch you guys later!  I've got some fixing up to do on this site. :D

       "This... Lycanthrope you speak of, has been p-plaguing us for months."  Hans began,  trying to compose himself as he looked out the window, staring at the evening sky, "It started with several attacks on the wildlife on the edges of the town."  The Confessor listened quietly, his eyes narrowed.  Hans wrung his fingers nervously, "It was just a few weeks ago when it attacked" Hans faltered, "or rather ate, a person." His eyes met the Confessor's before dropping down to look at the floor.  "Who was it?"  This time, it was the strangely angelic voice of Joanna du Winter.  The woman sat demurely, as she opened her fan.  "Jonas,"  Hans replied, grateful for the distraction from the Confessor's piercing gaze,  "The local c-cobbler."  The fat constable turned away from the window,  "His body was found half-eaten in his bed.  Gruesome sight... and the smell..."  "There have been others?"  the Confessor asked.  "Three more."  Hans replied quietly.  The Confessor pondered the situation quietly.  This was unlikely some mere  circumstance of random maulings.  He looked at Hans, "How much would you be willing to pay for the death of this beast?"  "Father!"  the voice called the attention of everyone in the room.  A young lady dressed in a riding suit and pants stood by the doorway, a rapier on her side.  Her golden curls were tied back neatly by a black ribbon and her face was a mask of contempt.  "Alice."  Hans gave a weary sigh, "p-please, these are guests..." he said touching his brow as if to ward off a headache.  "What is the meaning of this?"  Alice said, walking into the room, looking at the assembled group of unwashed  strangers  in her home, "Have you lost all pride in your heritage that you've decided to hire  mercenaries  now, Father?"  Hans opened his mouth to speak, throwing a fearful and apologetic glance towards the Confessor when Joanna spoke.  "And what would you have your father do?"  Alice whirled to face the woman, her eyes narrowed, "To take up a sword and to hunt the beast down."  her voice dripped with barely contained disdain, "To honor the family line and prove that he's not a sniveling rat!"  Joanna fanned herself calmly, "And you think that charging headlong to fight a beast that has slain four people with nothing but that overgrown knitting needle of yours is a prudent choice?"  "And what do you think  you  could do, harlot?"  Alice spat, "All dressed up in frilly dresses and-"   "I can do  this "  Joanna replied calmly, cutting off the girl's angry speech.  Alice's face suddenly seemed alarmed as she fell silent, and Hans choked back a scream as he watched his daughter's fall limply to the floor, her eyes rolling up into her head.  "Alice!"  Hans rushed to his daughters limp form, cradling her in his arms, his hand stroking her cold brow, "Please!"  his teary eyes imploring Joanna to cease her spell.  Joanna watched the unconscious girl for a moment, seeing the father crying over his ungrateful wretch of a daughter.  "Joanna,"  the Confessor spoke, "I believe that you've sufficiently proven your point."  Joanna's eyes turned to the confessor and held his gaze, as if to question his judgement.  Already she could feel Alice's life draining away with her magic, it was a fascinating experience, really, to squeeze out someone's life from a distance, slowly strangling the tethers that held her to this mortal coil.  "Joanna," the Confessor spoke again, his voice stern, "enough."  Joanna gave a theatrical sigh as she fanned herself, letting her control go, releasing the bonds that drained Alice's life away.  Alice gave a startled gasp and began coughing in spasms as she her eyes snapped open as if from a nightmare, her hair falling over her face and shoulders, tears streaming down her face as she fought for air.  Hans cried, holding his daughter close, rocking her back and forth.  The Confessor nodded to Joanna, then tapped his staff on the floor once more.  "Three hundred gold for each of us."  He said, as he crossed the room towards the exit, not bothering to look at Hans, "Expect the beast's corpse to be brought to the town square in not longer than a tenday."  The Penitent rose from their seats and followed the Confessor out into the darkness of the Allensburg night.  ----   Heya, been having a rough time at home and work lately, so I'm sorry about the delay.  Looks like some of my frustration and stress is leaking into my work, but don't worry, I'll keep the story going to it's conclusion.   It's part of my new years resolution to finish what I've begun. :)  Hope you guys are having a better day than I am!

       A dense green-gray fog covered the forest trail, slithering like a great snake around the trees and wrapping all within it in a cold chill that soaked through clothing and cut straight to the bone.  Within the mist, the faint strains of a violin playing a soft and mournful song, haunting in it's melody even as the music grows louder.  A silhouette of a caravan wagon comes into view, pulled by two large workhorses.  Their dark brown coats shimmering in the dim late afternoon sun, their large eyes peering under their jet-black manes.  On the wagon's seat was a man dressed in a weather-worn shirt.  It was once a florid shirt that would have been the height of fashion had it not been subjected to the kind of travel that the man had seen.  The man played the violin, seemingly heedless of where his horses were leading him, one booted foot on the edge of his seat, his mass of black curly hair obscuring his eyes as he focused on playing.  The caravan wound it's way down the trail until the mist broke, revealing the small, grass covered hill that they were on, and the gloomy looking town that was nestled at the bottom.  The clouds above rumbled slightly as a soft rain fell down to meet them.  The man put aside his violin, taking a bandana and wrapping it over his head to keep his hair out of his eyes and stopped the caravan.  He stepped off, his boots sloshing in the muddy ground as he knocked on the side of the caravan with his fist.  "We are here."  The man spoke, his voice thickly accented and foreign.  The door to the rear of the caravan creaked open in reply.  A single figure, broad shouldered and with the bearing of a military officer, stepped down.  He wore a black tricorn hat down over his eyes, and the collar of his longcoat was pulled up to keep the rain away.  In his hand he carried a long black-iron staff, with a cross decorating the top, and he wore a heavy iron key in a chain hanging about his neck.  The gypsy nodded quietly as the man approached,  "Confessor," the gypsy acknowledged, turning to look down from their place on the hill, "The town of Allensburg."  The Confessor looked at the town below with his piercing gray eyes, "Excellent, Gregorio,"  The Confessor's voice was deep and authoritative, as he turned to his companion,  "awaken the others.  If the letter from Hans is correct, then this is where we will find the Lycanthrope."  The gypsy man gave a smile as he walked to the rear of the caravan to rouse the rest of the Penitent.  This would be a very interesting stay.  ----  For a moment, Hans the constable questioned his sanity for writing the letter to solicit the aid of the mercenary company known as the Penitent.  His eyes flitted from one figure in his study to the next.  The rogue gypsy Gregorio, Thorne, the man who slaughtered a tavern in a fit of insane rage, Kwairen the Betrayer, Joanna du Winter, the witch of Crawford and finally the mysterious cleric known as the Confessor, the man who gave them a second chance.  "I-I was w-w-worried that you would not arrive, Father Confessor,"  Hans said, his double chins bobbing up and down as he stuttered, "It is nearly a t-tenday after I sent the letter."  The fat constable paced back and forth in his study, rather unnerved at the presence of his...  guests   "Oh ye of little faith..."  The Confessor gave a wry smile, before rapping the bottom of his staff to the floor as if to call things to order.  "Now, what information do you have on this lycanthrope?"  ----    that's it for today's installment of the Chronicles of the Penitent. :p  I wish I could write more, but sleep is calling me. :)  In case you're wondering, this is really an incubation story for a Ravenloft game I'm itching to run. :D  By the way, please feel free to place any comments, suggestions and points of improvement on it.  I've got a lot of writing practice to catch up on. :)  Good night everyone!

Cool. :)  Never knew I'd make a fairly interesting FF character. :)  I imagine this guy to be a bard type of guy that the ladies keep falling for.  :D  Of course, his rather colorful history with other women lends the comedy relief for the series.  Kind of like Captain Jack Sparrow in Tortuga, getting slapped by every other woman.  Except without the smell of cheap ale and rum, and more than his fair share of charm. ;)

       I'm not quite sure what it is about today, but I have a little tightness in my chest that just won't go away.  I've been rather irritable for the past few days, and my patience has been wearing thin.  I've been rude, crude and most likely offensive.  The part that pisses me off about it is that I don't know why.  I guess this is the reason that I got tossed to the 6th circle of hell in that blog quiz thingy.  Wrath and depression. :p  ----  I'd like to take this blog to apologize to  urlLink  k8   and my  urlLink  kitty   who were victims of my irrational behavior yesterday.  I should get a better grip on myself.  ----  On a lighter note, I finally got to hold my first game of  urlLink  Adventure!    I had a lot of fun holding the game (though my irritability reared it's ugly head again in mid-game) and I'm just glad that people had fun.  I never knew that GMing a dogfight would push my spatial intelligence to new limits. :))  Good work to all my players,  urlLink  Vlad  ,  urlLink  K8   and  urlLink  KJ  !  I had a great time GMing the game. :)  ----             Enneagram Test Results      Type 1    Perfectionism    ||||||||||||||   58%       Type 2    Helpfulness   ||||||||||||||||||   74%        Type 3    Image Awareness    ||||||||||||||||    66%       Type 4   Sensitivity    ||||||||||||||||||    74%        Type 5    Detachment    ||||||||||||    42%       Type 6   Anxiety    ||||||||||||    50%        Type 7    Adventurousness    ||||||||||||||||    70%        Type 8   Aggressiveness    ||||||||||||||    54%        Type 9   Calmness   ||||||||||||    50%

       This from today's newspaper:   urlLink   Millions of students may flunk this year     ...  I'm sorry, but unless I'm reading this wrong, this has to be one of the  stupidest  things I've heard of.  Teachers are trying to stop the passing grade from going up to 75%?!  I smell a bunch of scared teachers worried about their own evaluation once they see that the students that they  failed  to teach start taking nosedives in terms of passing exams.  Sadly, there are public school teachers in this country that are better off being shot and turned to fertilizer rather than teaching.  These are the ones that force their students into memorization automatons, drilling mindless idiocy rather than true learning.  These are those who slap down on imagination and original thought.  I hate you.  I had an experience trying to undo what you twits have done.  Back in high school, I taught English to a class of grade school students in public school.  When I asked them to speak in front of the class to introduce themselves, I was appalled at the incredible amount of brainwashing they've been through.  They all introduced themselves to the same formula, no originality, no personal flair, no charm.  "Good morning.  My name is _____.  I am _____ years old.  I live in _____.  I have ____ brothers and ____ sisters.  I study in ____ in _____ grade."  I stood there,  dumbfounded.  This will take a while to undo.  For the better part of the time I spent there teaching them, I tried my best to undo the damage.  I began engaging them in a little role-play (and they say its not a teaching tool), getting them to open up, letting them practice their english speaking skills in an environment where they could learn without fear of being graded, where mistakes were corrected,  but never punished.  My only regret was I didn't have enough time.  In the end, they were able to converse in english better than their peers, having learned the confidence to actually  use  the language to communicate rather than to just speak formulae and verse, no longer docile sheep prodded by unthinking idiots dressed in pea green uniforms.  This is one of those days when I really want to take an arnis stick and do a little practice in a public school, stalking teachers who act like little tyrants, or even those who spend their student's resources and time on worthless projects for "extra points" to make up for their lack of teaching ability.  WHACK! WHACK! WHACK!  God that would feel so damn good.

       Heya!  I'm here typing this now just before I head off to work, because I want to put everything that's happened yesterday down onto the blog before work whisks off the more important stuff off my mind. :)  The AEGIS recruitment drive was in full swing, and we got  99  signups interested in joining the mailing list.  It was fantastic how many different people end up enjoying the same hobby.  I got the chance to talk to a Dragon enthusiast, a lonely gamer who spoke of how long he had gone without a game, a Literature teacher from De La Salle University, a real-life Virtual Adept and a ton of other interesting folks.  On the game demos, We had four games running simultaneously  (better than yesterday) with my Matrix demo,  urlLink  tobie  's Vampire: the Masquerade, Jyli's Planeswalker and Elvin's Deadlands.  The demo's were all excellent as everyone who signed up left happy and excited about their games.  I was intimidated at first about handling a game for five newbies at the same time (especially when you consider that I needed to keep the pacing and action set on "high" all the time.)  But I guess it turned out okay.  Kudos to  urlLink  k8   for her brilliant idea of bribing newbies with chocolate. ;)  ----  Many thanks and pats on the back for everyone who joined and helped including such excellent individuals as:   urlLink  Vlad   - Mastermind of AEGIS' participation in the event and the head honcho of the Osias 11.   urlLink  K8   - The Auditor that just won't quit, who's boundless enthusiasm kept everyone going, and attention to detail kept everyone alert.   urlLink  Knight Jinx   - The hardest working man in the planet, who provided transportation, oversaw the booth, talked to potential recruits and put his RO merchant skillz to the test in real life.   urlLink  Tobie   - The Vampire Lord himself, who managed to put some darkness and angst into our demos, much to the delight of the Vampire lovin' recruits of the day.  Adrian and Nabs - The Great Old One himself and his better half, for their invaluable support and assistance.  Jyli - For being a Horny Man who Plays with His Wand in Public.  And all the other members of AEGIS who dropped by, stayed a while, and kept the whole group going.  ----  Well, I guess that's it for this entry.  I'll probably put more stuff as soon as I remember any more details worth telling.  Hope you guys have a great day! :)

       Hello,  I'm blogging this now to keep the details fresh in the electronic medium of my blog.  Started off today trying to experiment with my depth perception.  I figured that walking to Rockwell's Power Plant Mall all the way from the Guadalupe MRT Station would be inconsequential in terms of distance.  My depth perception failed.  It wasn't  horribly  long, but it was certainly far enough to give me second thoughts. :)  ----  Anyway, to the event proper.  The Convention was pretty cool, as it was nice to see all these niche groups come out in one single event.  My role in the AEGIS booth was to basically chat people up, and get them to sign our record sheet and maybe recruit them as new members.  Ended up standing most of the day, and talking even more, especially since I held an rpg demo based on the Matrix.  The Matrix demo I ran was pretty good,  had three players attend the game and we all had a blast.  Funky acrobatics and gun-fu stunts galore. :)  Agents flipping cars and going all kung fu on them helped a whole lot too.  Aside from that, we've been getting new players into the group, some of which were interested in the games for a  long  time but never had the chance to play, or didn't have anyone to play with.  That's where we step in. :)  We offer them a chance to play the games they've been looking at (and owned in some cases) for so long,  with people that won't make them feel left out.  It's a win-win situation in my book.  I'm glad though that things are working out this way, with the new blood entering the AEGIS' aged veins, we're bound to see new ideas, and maybe (hopefully!) a new generation of GMs taking the reins of their own groups.  There aren't enough of us GMs in the world, I guess. :)  ----   urlLink  Vlad  ,  urlLink  K8   and  urlLink  Knight Jinx   were all present and giving 200%, we were up and running and we never let up.  Great work guys! :)  Anyway, I'm tired and sleepy and it's gettin really late.  I've got an encore Matrix Demo (different plot for the players who want a second go) tomorrow along side the  urlLink  tobie  's Vampire demo, and Jyli's Planeswalker demo as well.  It feels good to be a gamer.  I'm tired and sleepy, but at least I can go to sleep content and proud to have done something for the gaming community. :)

        Portents   I've been flipping through  urlLink  It's in the Vlad   and I saw a link to  urlLink  Raymond-Lo.com's   predictions for the year of the monkey.  Lot's of interesting stuff up there, but here's something that caught my attention:   Property industry is classified as Earth element, as earth produces metal, the strong presence of metal this year will bring strong activities in the property market. This will be more obvious in autumn and winter. The other industries represented by Earth elements are insurance, mining, chemical, computer software …etc. These industries will be active and productive in 2004. Another industry more favourable in 2004 will be business related to fire element which are energy, electricity, entertainment, restaurant, and electronic goods…. It seems there will be more activities in fire industries as fire conquers metal, so a strong metal year means money profit for the fire industries. This favours oil prices.    Property, software and retaurants eh?  Interesting indeed... ;)  On a negative note:   The other animal sign under negative influences is the Monkey, which is offending the year. Also the Snake is having a penalty relationship with the year. Penalty is related to hidden danger, hidden sickness. So people born in year of Tiger, Snake, or Monkey should also be careful of their health this year, as this three penalty is of fire nature and they may bring sickness related to blood and heart.    I guess I should take better care of my blood pressure then :p  If you guys are interested in what's going to happen to you specifically, try checking out  urlLink  This site    -----  On other interesting places to check out, try drifting over to  urlLink  Facade   and get free tarot, rune, i-ching and a bunch of other readings for fun :)  Hope you're all having a great day!

       "Us?!"  Gregorio held his dagger up, swearing in his native tongue as he began looking frantically around them, "Did it just say 'us'?!"  The mists roiled around them, as if stalking their every move,  eagerly waiting for the kill.  Throne did not reply, instead brandishing his axe as he began circling around the hideous creature, taking cautious steps, readying himself from any sort of attack.  The creature followed Thorne closely with its head, twisting at an unnatural angle, one limb poised in mid-air, pivoting on all fours like a spider.  "Die!"  Gregorio hurled his dagger, the blade making a curious whistling sound as it sped towards the creature,  burying itself on the thing's shoulder with a dull THUNK!  The creature flinched, hissing and crying out as it jumped towards the injured gypsy.  Thorne chose this moment to strike.  Grabbing the handle of his axe with both hands, he rushed forward, intercepting the beast and spinning around quickly, placing all his weight, and uncoiling from the waist with ferocious strength, burying the head of his axe into the beast's ribs with the sound of snapping bones.  The thing's claws swiped mere inches from Gregorio's face when Thorne's axe wedged itself into it's ribcage.  Thorne followed through with his blow, swinging his axe and dislodging it from the creature's ribs, leaving a gruesome chest wound that spewed vile black ichor even as it thrashed about, drowning in its own blood as it filled its lungs.  The mists responded with a low moan, seeping towards the thing's corpse, concealing it with gray-green vapor.  Thorne turned to look at Gregorio, who fell down to the ground, clutching his wounded leg.  Already the flesh near the wounds had begun to turn into a vile shade of purple.  "Hold on."  Thorne said, picking up the smaller man and hauling him over his shoulder, "I'll take you to a healer."  Taking one last look over to where the beast's corpse lay shrouded in mist, Thorne began making his way through the forest back to the town of Allensburg.  As they left, six other figures crept out of the mists, jerky limbs and misshapen heads creeping down from the treetops.  The largest, with a body of a hairy spider and the face of a beautiful woman,  watched as Thorne left, her eyes gleaming with a hungry glow.  ----  "Hail, Jonas Ervin."  Joanna intoned, completing the summoning ceremony, and regarding the ghost of the slain cobbler.  Jonas was a slight man, whose form betrayed a lack of any kind of martial training.  His hair was blonde at some point, though the spectral pallor that shrouded his image left many details bare.  He appeared as he had died, his ribcage torn open, and shreds of his intestines hanging out, dripping ghostly blood.  Kwairen kept alert.  He had been with Joanna long enough to know how some of her magic worked.  The Keepers of the Dead are loathe to allow the slain to return to the lands of the living, and many of the denizens from beyond follow such summoning trails in the hopes of attaining an extended stay in the mortal realm by slaying the summoner.    He was Joanna's shield.   "Speak to me of the beast that slew you."  Joanna stated her voice clear as a church bell, "Tell me of the Lycanthrope."  Jonas' dead eyes fixed upon her, and another wave of cold wind assaulted them, "They were not Lycanthropes."  he spoke, his voice distant and hollow, "Ghastly misshappen creatures, composed of parts both animal and man, yes,  but not shapeshifters."  Joanna narrowed her eyes,  misshappen creatures?   This was not something they had encountered before.  The Confessor must be informed.  "How were you slain?"  she forced herself to speak, suddenly realizing that she had very little time to maintain the spell.  "They came to my home."  Jonas replied, "crawling through the fireplace, the windows and the doors.  Claws and teeth.  Claws and teeth held me down for their mother.  Their mother, beautiful and horrid feasted upon my innards..."  "Beautiful and horrid?"  Joanna raised an eyebrow, "what do you-"  Her question was cut short when she heard it.  A low piercing wail coming from the depths of the graveyard soil, the very ground quaking in fear.  Kwairen looked sharply at Joanna, making a cutting motion with his hand.  End it!  Now!  Joanna began chanting then, unweaving her spell, her voice rising with urgency as she felt them, the Keepers of the Dead, clawing their way to her enchantment, using it as a lifeline to locate the spirit of Jonas and draw him back to whatever fate awaited him in oblivion.  The ground shook harder as the wail turned into a scream.  Kwairen dropped into a defensive stance, ready for anything that could possibly appear.  Joanna unweaved her spell, her heart beating furiously in her ribcage as she felt the Keepers sniffing out her spell, tracking her down.  Words of power and binding tumbled out of her mouth as she weaved symbols with her hands, sweat beading her brow.  A tearing pain in her mind told her that the Keepers were near,  the agony threatening to break her concentration.  Joanna fell to her knees,  tears streaming down her face, her hair falling over her features as she gasped out the final syllables of the spell, and Jonas' ghost faded into nothingness.  The lights in her eyes told her that she was just on the verge of passing out, and she felt Kwairen's strong hands helping her up.  "Kwairen,"  she gasped, "We must warn the others."  -----  "It was Annabelle."  the priest spoke, his voice quaking with fear, the effects of the spell still lingering in his mind.  "Annabelle?"  the Confessor released the priests collar, watching the wretched holy man sprawled on the pew.  "She... was a local midwife." the priest said, his voice steadier now, as he tried to sit up, "We caught her enacting a pagan ritual."  The Confessor did not reply, waiting.  "You do not understand me."  The priest said, his eyes pleading,  "She was praying to those before the gods!  To her woodlands deities and spirits!  Abominations!  Jonas was the one who saw her, following her out into the woods one night."  "And what crime did she commit?"  the Confessor asked.  "Crime?"  the priest asked, dumbfounded, "She was a  heretic !  Her worship is not that of our people and her ways are not in our understanding!"  The Confessor was impassive, "To be different is not a crime.  Did she use her magics to harm anyone?"  The priest was silent.   "I thought so."  the Confessor gave him a disgusted look, "And you cursed her?  You used your own holy abilities to punish her simply for being different?"  The priest's eyes were haunted by shame.  "That is all I need to know."  The Confessor turned to leave, his boots clicking on the empty Church's floor tiles.  "Now I must put an innocent woman to death, for your curse has turned her into a monster."  The priest merely followed the Confessor's figure with his eyes.  "Know this."  the Confessor said, "Her crimes are marked on your soul."  With that, the Confessor stepped out into the night, his hand tight around his black iron staff, tricorn hat pulled down, and heart weary at the thought of the task ahead.  -----   Hey guys! Just finished part 5.  I'm dedicating this one to my kitty, whose birthday is today! :)  Happy Birthday! :)  Anyway, as always,  I'm open to suggestions and comments.  This is the first attempt to do action for this series, and I'm eager (and nervous) to see what you guys think about it! :D  Hope you guys are having a great evening!

       Heya,  Stumbled upon  urlLink   This Sinfest Strip on innuendoes    and realized how much it sounds like the GB3 group.  :p  Check it out guys, you know who you are. ;)  -----  And for all it's crassness and bluster, here's a  urlLink   heart warming    moment from sinfest.  Trust me, it's one of the few things that I've encountered over the past few weeks to really make me smile.  -----  I'll most likely post more stuff tomorrow.

       Hey guys,  Taking a break off writing Chronicles of the Penitent for now. :p Gonna enjoy my weekend a bit.  Work was admittedly very strange.  I was headed to the office when I saw three people about my age looking very distressed and knocking on the glass security door of a nearby Automated Teller Machine.  It took a few seconds for me to realize that they'd been locked inside, and no amount of budging on my part could open the door.  Fortunately a quick slip of a laminated ID card by the latch got them out, I was able to head off to work no later, and oddly amused by the amount of relief on the faces of the three trapped people.  -----  On another note, please visit India's blog over on the sidebar, it's the one with the title, "For orange skies".  India was nice enough to link to me, so I'm giving her a little plug of my own as a show of thanks and appreciation. :)  -----  Well, aside from that, things are pretty quiet.  I'm giving myself some time to relax and ease off my brain.  I don't want to burn myself out. :)  Anway, hope you guys are having a great day!

       A talk with  urlLink  Vin   about the Chronicles of the Penitent stories had him mention a contest where the winners got money and their works published.  After reading one 1st prize story, I have to admit that I am definitely  intimidated .  *takes a deep breath to focus*  Have to keep myself going and write this whole thing down.  I'll worry about edit later, and then  maybe  it'll be good enough to consider as even worth submitting.  -----  For now here's a little something I've discovered...   urlLink   OBEY!     -----  Now that I've attacked my wookie, I'll focus on getting some writing done for part 5. :)

       Mercy..." Thorne whispered quietly as they approached the rotting corpse, suddenly aware of the incredibly nauseating smell as they drew near.    She's only a child...  Thorne realized. Her body was twisted unnaturally, her shoulders almost completely twisted around in an unnatural angle. Her stomach as torn open and her entrails feasted upon by some unknown animal. She would have been fair-skinned, but death had stolen away her beauty, leaving only the bloated, blue-green hue of a corpse.   "Dead for some time now." Gregorio spoke somberly, "Mauled by the beast, it seems. The manner of death matches the constable's description."    "No child should be doomed to die so horribly." Thorne spoke, when he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. He began looking around, his eyes darting among the trees around them. The cold, insidious fog had crept up around them, rising ever so slowly, concealing the very ground they walked on.   Thorne felt his body tense as he felt the cold grip of fear strike his heart. They were vulnerable, he realized, even as the mist rose to shroud the forest in a ghostly haze making it difficult to see anything past a few meters. Gregorio seemed to feel the same way, flipping his dagger into his palm and holding it ready.   "It would seem that even nature conspires against us, friend." Gregorio spoke, breaking the oppressive silence around them.   "Get ready." Thorne warned him, even as he drew out his axe, "Something's watching."   The two stood still, with nothing but their breathing disturbing the eerie silence that surrounded them. Gregorio said a quick prayer even as he held his dagger up, weaving the tip back and forth, keeping his stance light.   Suddenly, a frenzied burst of fur and claws and teeth came from nowhere, the mist swirling with it's passing. Gregorio let out a cry of pain as he dropped to the ground, his thigh bleeding from a large claw gash.   "Gregorio!" Thorne whirled around to face the beast. It was easily the size of a horse, and vaguely wolf-like in appearance. It stood on all fours, but it's limbs ended in what looked like hands with wicked black talons rather than paws. Coarse black fur covered it's back and it's limbs, and it's face resembled a man far more than it did a wolf. Cruel rows of razor sharp teeth lined its gaping maw, it's eyes wide in sadistic anticipation of another kill, even as it circled around them with strange loping strides.  "Many, many more things to eat."  it spoke, it's voice soft and pure like a child,  even as it's eyes betrayed it's malice, "Come to play with us tonight?"  -----   Joanna frowned a bit as she raised her skirt slightly, making her way through the muddy graveyard soil.  Gathering herbs to make poultices and love potions were one thing, she thought, but tromping around muddy graveyards are a different thing altogether.  "The things a witch must do."  She complained to her silent companion even as her footing almost failed her on a patch of mud.  Kwairen only gave her a smile as he followed, his surefooted steps finding the driest path in whatever mud they crossed.  Around them, the graveyard was a somber sight.  Lopsided tombstones and markers dotted the landscape, and weeds choked the life out of whatever little vegetation that grew in the place.  The two companions found their destination soon enough.  It was a somber looking grave, with freshly dug earth covering the grass, and a simple tombstone marked with the name of Jonas Ervin in solid block letters.  Kwairen looked at Joanna, and stood quietly off to one side of the grave.  "Well now, Jonas."  Joanna smiled, as she knelt down to take a handful of grave dirt in her hand, "time for you to wake up."  Taking the dirt in her hand, Joanna closed her eyes and sent forth her will, calling for the soul of Jonas the slain.  She began to sing, her voice cold and crystal clear, resonating with the anguish of the fallen, the despair of the unavenged.  Kwairen looked at her, watching the weave her magic.  Joanna's song continued as she sprinked the grave dirt over Jonas' resting place, calling him, urging his soul to rise, fanning the flames of revenge and hate, calling for him to aid them in finding his killer.  "Arise fallen one."  Joanna intoned, breathless as she shaped the song into her will, feeling Jonas' spirit respond, seeking her out, fueled by the tragedy of his demise.  With a peircing wail, a shadow of a man drifted over the grave, hovering silently in place.    "Who promises me vengeance?"  the shadow man's voice was distant, almost inaudible.  "I, Joanna du Winter, the Witch of Crawford."  she replied, her lips in a satisfied smile.  -----  "I know this."  The Confessor spoke his eyes never leaving the priest's, "Creatures like these do not strike without reason.  They are borne of hate and damnation," his eyes narrowed, "Who would have reason to strike against the townsfolk?  Who have you condemned with your foolish judgement?"  The priest clutched at his collar, trying to loosen the Confessor's iron grip.  "I... I know nothing!"  he cried.  "You  lie !"  the Confessor roared, his voice echoing throughout the abandoned church, "I see guilt in your eyes."  he slammed the priest down into a pew, his fist squeezing the collar even tighter.  The priest's eyes were wide as the confessor looked  into  him, his mind flooded with an incredible burden, as if his very soul were being measured.  Everything he has done, his doubts, fears, and secrets spilling forth from the chambers of his consciousness, brought forth, stripping him naked of all his  pretenses, parading his weakness and his vulnerability.  The Confessor held the priest down as he watched the priest's eyes open wide in shock, his face growing pale as the Confessor employed his gift of  Remorse .  Tears came, unbidden, streaking down the priest's face as he stopped struggling, curling up into a fetal position, sobbing quietly.  "No more..." the priest begged, his voice wracked with sobs, "please..."  "Then tell me what I want to know."  -----   Got some action coming up in the next installment. :p  I hope you guys like it!  I'm surprised I've gotten this far.  I expected to write a short story, but the way this is going, it might be far longer than that. :D

       The clouds over Allensburg hung over the moon like a funeral shroud, rendering the brilliant moonlight into an ash-grey haze that concealed as much as illuminated.  Shadows pooled like tangible, living things, staking their claim over the town,  retreating only from the piercing glare of the lamp that the Confessor carried.  They stood in the center of the town square, all of them clad in thick coats in a futile attempt to ward off the cold.  "We have ten days,"  The Confessor spoke, his breath misting in the air, "We know too little about this Lycanthrope as of yet, so we must gather whatever information we can."  He turned to Gregorio and Thorne, "The two of you will scout out the surrounding wilderness."  He allowed himself a small smile, "Both of you have excellent tracking skills... and whatever Gregorio's daggers cannot bring down, your axe will."  He nodded to the larger of the two.  Thorne nodded grimly, his hand subconsciously wrapping itself around the hilt of the broad axe strapped to his back.  Kwairen looked at the Confessor, gracefully gesturing to himself and Joanna.  "You two will serve as my eyes and ears to the people."  the Confessor answered, "I fear that Hans will not be of any help to us regarding this beast.  Perhaps the family of Jonas the cobbler would be able to give us more information."  "It shall be done."  Joanna replied quietly, as Kwairen bowed.  The Confessor turned his gaze towards an old church building on the far side of the town.  Birds, ravens perhaps, were perched on the bell tower, watching him back.   "We meet back here tomorrow at noon."  He said, as he pulled his tricorn hat lower over his eyes and walked towards the church.  ----  "What do you suppose this Lycanthrope could be, Gregorio?"  Thorne asked, his large frame moving with surprising grace as he followed the small gypsy man through the forest trail.  "A Werewolf, perhaps?"  Gregorio replied, his voice thick with his accent, his hand playing with a narrow, pointed dagger.   "Maybe."  Thorne replied, as he looked around.  Already the green-gray mists began to rise again, the icy tendrils of fog wrapping about their legs.  Thorne grit his teeth,  as the cold brought back memories of his crime.  A bloody axe, and a terrible feeling of being so cold.  Fingers stiff, wrapped tightly around the axe hilt with the grip of a drowning man.  Legs cold, rapidly cooling blood pooling at his feet.  Icy silence ringing in his ears, save for the distant crackling of a fireplace.  "Thorne!"  The larger man snapped out of his dreadful reverie when Gregorio stopped, pointing something out near a clearing with his dagger.  Thorne walked up to the smaller man, squinting his eyes to see...  There was something within the mists,  an odd shape breaking the smooth outline of the meadow.  A mass of torn edges and odd angles, of caked mud and matted hair.  ----  Joanna moved with sure grace, Kwairen following quietly beside her.  "I do not wish to waste our time speaking with these townsfolk."  Joanna stated, "They are too paralyzed with fear to give us anything of value."  Kwairen gave her an inquisitive look.  "It's really simple, Kwairen."  Joanna flashed him a smile, "We seek out first-hand information."  Kwairen finally nodded in understanding, looking towards the direction of the Allensburg cemetery.  ----  The doors of the church swung easily enough, the Confessor thought, as he pushed open one of the large double-doors to the church.  The interior of the church cried out of faded glories, lifeless tapestries and grey paintings hung on either side.  Shadows filled the church where the faithful should have been, and a lone, incomplete candelabra lent it's lonely light to the altar.  A single figure stood by the altar, dressed in simple robes.  His square-jawed face was one of dislike the moment the Confessor entered.  Almost protectively the priest circled around the altar and walked briskly up the center asile to meet the Confessor.  "You."  The priest said, with barely disguised disapproval.  "Greetings."  the Confessor replied, with a sardonic smile and an exaggerated look over the church interiors, "Has the donation tray been getting a little lighter as of late?"  The priest leveled a glare at his unwelcome guest,  "I have heard of you, Confessor.  I do not know what madness it was that drove Hans to send for your aid, but we do not need you here."  "Really now?"  the Confessor said propping up his staff beside him, "It doesn't seem that way considering four of your flock have met their untimely demise over the past few months."  The priest narrowed his eyes, "They are  my  flock, Confessor, and it is  my  god that will watch over them."  The Confessor looked over the altar to see the image of the priest's god,  a proud and haughty fellow, holding a sword and looking very much like a protector and conqueror at the same time.  "As it will be."  the Confessor said, moving with a speed that caught the priest by surprise, the Confessor's fist wrapped around the priest's collar, "Your god  will  watch.  It's what he has always done.   I  however, will act."  The priest opened his mouth to say something when the Confessor rapped the side of his face with the cross-shaped tip of his staff and tightened his grip on the priest's collar.  "I have not come here to discuss the finer points of theology with you."  the Confessor hissed, "I come here seeking information on this Lycanthrope.  What your god thinks of me is none of my concern."  "Then why do you seek me out?"  the priest gasped, trying to breathe.  "Because,"  the Confessor leaned closer, "No one knows the flock better than it's sheperd."  -----    OOoookay... this project is getting longer everytime I type a new installment. :p I this one isn't as quickly paced as the previous one, but I hope you guys still like it!

       Hey there,  I'm still alive.  Albeit rather on the wrong side of the employment spectrum for now.  The demo class held in Xavier went pretty much okay, I guess.  But I'm getting a little nervous that they haven't called back.  I'm trying to keep calm as we speak. :)  On other news, I'm catching up with a few things that I've been remiss in (like Chronicles of the Penitent) and I hope to get that done sometime this week as well.  ----    This pretty much sums up how I feel right now.

       Yes, before you all start shoveling dirt into the hole you've dug and lowered the immobile body of this blog into,  I was to take this moment to startle mad scientists everywhere and twitch.  *twitches*  There.  Now that I've suitably proven that I have not yet grown to the relative IQ of a carrot, I will take this opportunity to explain the relative silence of this blog.  The past few weeks have been  really  busy.  Vin, I know I haven't put up the latest installment of the Chronicles of the Penitent.  Don't worry, it's in the pipe.  For those who have successfully proven that my Left Brain Right Brain post does not apply to everyone, congratulations.  You've just won a chance to play  urlLink   Battleship!     And for those like me who'd rather sit and make money, try your hand at a simple little business simulator based of a  really  old commodore 64 game:  urlLink   The Lemonade Stand Game!     And finally for those who don't want to think and have insane amounts of hand eye coordination... go  urlLink   Save the Goldfish!     ----  Seriously though, I'm working on the next installment of Chronicles... but right now my brain is really tired. :)  Hope you guys are having a great day!

       Hey guys,  Just wanted to put up a real life update for once.  Yesterday was a good day for me, having picked up the latest issue of Seeker, the local hobby and gaming magazine.  It turns out that my article looks pretty good in it. :)  It's a small thing, really, but I'm proud to have at least  something  out and published, both to promote the hobby and to add something to my resume.  The good news is that I'm being asked to make it a regular column.  :)  I've accepted it, but will most likely end up still being freelance.  *crosses fingers*  here's hoping that things will start looking up from here.  ----  Held a short game of  urlLink   Final Stand   , the irreverent kung fu RPG for a group of gifted students yesterday.  It wasn't a very long game... and neither was it very coherent, but it looked like they had fun.  I'm just glad to indoctrinate new people to the world of RPGs. :)  Here's hoping that they'll find the hobby an enjoyable one to try their own games.

       hello all you control freaks! :)  Just because I have the amazing ability to go to weird sites, try  urlLink   ordering this chicken around   .  I've given it a shot and to be perfectly honest, it's downright freaky that he really does whatever you type...  Some commands I've given it are: - jump up and down - flap your wings - lie down and flop like a fish (yes, I'm aware I'm giving this instruction to a giant man in a chicken suit, but it's fun anyway)  I'd go on, but I felt sorry for the guy.   ----  Now that I think about it, it would be nice if I had the power to make people I dislike as subservient as that chicken.  I'd be like the Crab in the Obey the Crab game, only meaner. >:D  ----     Some new artwork from the upcoming Vampire: the Requiem RPG from the new World of Darkness.  Looks interesting... I wonder how the new Mage will look?

       Remember the result that I got from the "What book am I?" Quiz?"  They've made a movie out of it.   urlLink   I, ROBOT    by Isaac Asimov  It looks nothing like the book, I hear.  However, since I have not read the book, I'm going by sheer eye candy.  :D

On other news, I've discovered a device that I'd definitley want to  urlLink   have   .  ----  Trying to rule the world is an expensive hobby.  In fact, I've been looking around the internet for some things to help me in my endeavor, but all I could find was  urlLink   this   .  Not very promising, I'm afraid.  Thankfully, one of my henchmen informed me that there was another way.  And so I went out and found a perfect place where I could spend my well stolen American Dollars to finance my quest for Global Domination.

It's a rules light RPG that's designed to be easy to play to provide as much help to people who haven't played an RPG before.  If you're interested to run this game for your group of friends, you can download the PDF  urlLink   here   .  Please check it out and tell me what you guys think.  I'm working on it to give it some more polish and to work out any kinks in the system, and I might even add some artwork into it. :)  Who knows, it might actually be a hit. ;)

        urlLink   The Theocracy of Pointymandia    is a very large, safe nation, notable for its compulsory vegetarianism. Its compassionate, cynical population of 86 million are ruled with an iron fist by the dictatorship government, which ensures that no-one outside the party gets too rich. In their personal lives, however, citizens are relatively unoppressed; it remains to be seen whether this is because the government genuinely cares about its people, or if it hasn't gotten around to stamping out civil rights yet.  It is difficult to tell where the omnipresent government stops and the rest of society begins, but it juggles the competing demands of Religion & Spirituality, Education, and Defence. The average income tax rate is 50%, and even higher for the wealthy. A large private sector is led by the Arms Manufacturing industry, followed by Automobile Manufacturing and Soda Sales.  Public loudspeakers constantly tell citizens they are "happy people", Pointymandia's educational system is the envy of many and regarded as a pinnacle of educational acheivement, high-income earners pay a 100% tax rate, and citizens are allowed to rise or fall based on their own merits. Crime is totally unknown. Pointymandia's national animal is the wallaby, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the point.

       After a visit up to La Union with Alex, Lenard and Ross for a project, I'm finally back here at home with my computer.  The trip was interesting to say the least, with the infernal bus rides of around 6 hours long.  The bus rides were long but a considerably amusing experience, with the lessons of freezing buses at night, and the mouthy grandmother who complained to anyone about anything.  Add mighty balancing food vendors, the occasional missing passenger and a late night viewing of 13th Warrior, and I can say that I wasn't  too  bored.  The trip consisted of taking a lot of pictures off the digital camera for a project, but we did get to take a few pictures including:   Secret Agent Alex doing his best Solid Snake Impression!   urlLink     and The Funky Eagle Plane!   urlLink

       Hey guys,  The RPG community in the Philippines is still not exactly large enough to be recognizable, unlike the gigantic behemoth that is the Pinoy anime community.  As such, I guess it's time to hit low by promoting RPGs that require next to nothing to get into.  In fact, I'm linking to several places where people can get samplers of games that are currently in the market.  As my Uncle say, "Free is very good price"  ----  1.  urlLink   Final Stand    by Tim Denee  Final Stand can be best described as "one part Tekken and two parts Kung Fu Theatre".  This 23 page PDF download contains one of the most amusing combat systems I have ever encountered in  any  game, amateur or professional.  Set in a rather generic backdrop known as Big City, Final Stand has a five minute character creation process using Stereotypes from Chinese movies that anyone can immediately recognize.  In fact, playing up the quirks of each stereotype actually  rewards  the Character with Chi that he can use in combat.  Fast, Fun and a must have in any RPG collection.  2.  urlLink   Exalted Quickstart Rules    by White Wolf Publishing  Exalted.  By far  the  best new fantasy game out there that isn't related to d20, Exalted has players taking the roles of demigods.  Champions of the gods whose awesome powers and incredible deeds can build kingdoms and topple empires.  Anime-influenced action, epic storylines equal to Greek myths and storytelling potential that White Wolf is famous for.  While this free quickstart has some information on the game, I'd highly recommend checking out the real thing.  I might cover Exalted's expansive setting in another article.    3.)  urlLink   Spycraft Lite    by Alderac Entertainment  d20 Fans shouldn't be disappointed, at least  one  of the developers has decided that it would be good to show what their game can do without any cash out.  Spycraft is a game of modern espionage much to the tune of Mission: Impossible.  Unlike most other d20 books, Spycraft's Corebook doesn't require the use of any of the D&D corebooks to use... as long as you know how to generate character scores.  Game wise, Spycraft is excellent.  While a little heavy on the GM planning part, the game boasts of excellent classes and gadgets to get the espionage vibe going on any dungeon delving group.  For Spycraft Lite Character Sheets, click  urlLink   here   .  4.  urlLink   Steampunk Mafia    by Jay Steven Anyong  This alternate world game takes place in a fictional American City known as New Providence in the middle of 1920.  It was a time of terror, as the mafia families took to the streets, robbing banks and stealing from businesses without fear.  The police were powerless to stop them, because the Mafia had one very powerful advantage: 12 foot tall, Steampowered Mecha known as Kodiaks.  Players can take the side of either the Mafia or the Police and take to the streets to either protect, or conquer New Providence.  This RPG is complete and free, and is designed by me.  If you've got time, download it and give it a shot, heck you could even review it and post your thoughts over in the comments section, I'd be glad to hear from any of you.

       Given my penchant for running into strange games, I'm thinking of doing a series blogs about games that I personally think would rock, but aren't available here.  First up would be  urlLink    Jadeclaw    , by  urlLink   Sanguine Productions Ltd.         Just what  is  Jadeclaw, anyway?   Jadeclaw would be pretty much summed up as an Anthropomorphic Fantasy Roleplaying Game set in a place that is similar to Mythic China.  The one thing different about it though, is that you don't play humans.  You play animals.  Remember all the Disney TV shows you've seen like Duck Tales, Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers and Tale Spin?  Think about that and you've sort of got an idea of what the characters look like.  While some people don't really care much for "furries", I think that the decision to make a game like this using animal races adds to the charm of the game.   urlLink     Click on the picture to see a bigger version (opens in a new window)   So we've got humanoid animals running around a setting that's a reflection of Mythic China, what now?   Well, for one thing, Jadeclaw is actually pretty well recognized for the fact that it has a very well thought out setting, complete with Myths and a history of it's own Emperors and legendary heroes.  Players can create pretty much any kind of character they want, from Serene Panda Monks, to wily Snake Advisors, to powerful Monkey Sorcerors to even roguish Fox Swordsmen.  The thing that I think is key to RPGs is that the setting has to be large enough to sustain a campaign.  In this case, Jadeclaw has it in spades.  To check out a rather lengthy (but very cool) background on the setting, click  urlLink   here     I'm pretty much impressed by this game despite the fact that Sanguine Productions isn't a very large company, and they don't have that much in terms of Marketing budget as compared to White Wolf or Wizards of the Coast. However, they've done very well in making the setting for the game,  and while I've heard some detractors to the system it uses (number one complaint being the fact that the system get's very complex at times) I'm sure that it's still a book that's definitely worth checking out.  If it ever finds it's way over here, of course.

       If there's one particular comic strip character that truly makes my evil side laugh, it would definitely be Milkman Dan, the evil milkman who perpetually torments Karen in  urlLink   Red Meat   .  here are a few examples of his utter lack of mercy:        of course, Karen is a quick learner.     interestingly enough, there's one particular strip in the series that made me wonder why I had a warm fuzzy feeling when I read it:

       The steady beating of wardrums, accompanied by the steady rhythm of the clanking armor of a hundred thousand troops marching in perfect formation drew Harkan's attention.  Harkan stood alone at the bottom of a smoking crater, a massive pit of upturned soil and broken bodies.  Tendrils of steam rose from the bone dry soil and the charred corpses around him, scraps of armor welded to dead flesh.  Even as the cacophony drew nearer, Harkan nonchalantly made his way up the slope of the crater.  Over him, the clouds grew dark with the promise of rain.  Harkan stepped out of the crater into the grassy battlefield, watching as the sounds stopped.  A forest of weapons and warbanners filled the horizon, an army, twice as numerous as the one before stood before him.  With a loud cry, the army began to descend upon him, the ordered marching devolving into an ear-shattering rumble, the very earth shaking at their steps.  Harkan raised his hand to the sky and called forth his blade, a massive bolt of lightning arcing down to the palm of his hand.  Wrapping his hand on the shaft of the lighting bolt,  he drew it in, shaping it to the form of a glowing, crackling sword.  It was then when the rain fell, a massive downpour followed by torrential winds, forcing soldiers to the ground.  Harkan marched wordlessly, swinging his blade in crackling arcs, hewing easily through shields and swords alike, leaving nothing behind but smoking severed limbs and the groans of dying men...

       Hey guys,  I've stumbled upon a site called  urlLink   Creative Commons   , it's a website for an initiative to create a different kind of Copyright.  Instead of a complete copyright, it enables people to cover  some  of their rights while allowing other people in the web to alter, distribute or sell it depending on how the author allows it to be.  The cool thing about it is that it allows individuals to tailor their own copyright and it produces three versions, a People-readable version, a Lawyer-readable version and a Machine readable version.  Either way, it covers all your bases and gives you control on how you want your work to be protected.  Since I'm not all that well versed in it, check out the  urlLink   flash video    explaining how the whole thing works.  ----  Speaking of creative endeavors, I've got the updated version of my FREE pen and paper RPG creation, Steampunk Mafia up over  urlLink   here   ! Please check it out if you guys can and tell me what you think. :)  It's been improved since the last update, with a little more background information on the setting, a new character sheet and cleaned up rules for the Kodiaks.  Well, I think that's it for now.  I'll catch you guys later!

       Check this out:     Well, okay it's about knights (again) but heck forgive my fascination with them.  Anyway, the point I was trying to make is that this little illustration over here was actually painted way back in 1917, by an American painter by the name of N.C. Wyeth.  Admittedly, it's a very well done piece, and I'm sure a lot of illustrators today (like a few guys which paint the images for Magic: the Gathering cards) could pick up a thing or two from this guy.

          I remember reading through Battle Angel Alita in comic book form way back in High School.  A classmate was generous enough to lend me his copy and I was hooked.  The story of a cyborg girl who was found in a scrap heap by a mysterious doctor (who weilds one of the coolest weapons I've seen, the Rocket Hammer!) and repaired to find her true self was something that struck me as very cool.  Alita's struggle to find her identity, coupled with the emotions of a human faced with a world that is essentially a post-apocalyptic scrap heap made for a fascinating read.  Of course, the action of the series was also fantastic, as it turns out that Alita somehow retains the knowledge of the supreme cyborg martial arts known as the "Panzer Kunst"  (as evidenced by the picture above).  In the course of her adventures, she switches bodies several times, joins a futuristic killer sport known as Motor Ball, and (in the anime at least) falls in love.  If you guys haven't read the comics, give it a shot.  The anime is also very well done, even if the violence is rather on the high side.

          I'm suffering from a nostalgic fit right now, and to be perfectly honest, I feel like putting up a little tribute to The Metabarons, a comic book series by Alexandro Jodorowsky.  To those unfamiliar with the series (which will be a lot of people) try picking it up in your local comic book stores.  It's a series with an insane idea with every page but has the storytelling punch of a Greek Myth.  Anyway, what brought about this particular post is news I saw  urlLink   here    regarding DC comics picking up the Humanoids TPBs and converting them to the smaller format (no more oversized books, I guess...) and the Metabarons is one of them. :D  Vin, if you're reading this, I have yet to get the first compilation as well as Warrior and Poet. :)  Good news is that  urlLink   Dreamshifters    may yet see the light of day...

       "Confessor."   Joanna spoke, her throat burning from the pain of the summoning spell's feedback and her near brush with the Keepers of the Dead.  Kwairen was holding her up, supporting her weight on his shoulders.  They had found him back at the town square, having just exited the Church.  The Confessor looked up from the brim of his tricorn hat, his eyes narrowed at Joanna's weakened state, "What  happened?"  he asked as he drew near to inspect her for any wounds.  "I'll be alright."  Joanna rasped, "We're not fighting Lycanthropes..."  she winced from the pain, "They are something else entirely."  "She's right."  Thorne said as he ran towards them, carrying Gregorio's unconscious body,  "We ran into one in the forests.  It managed to poison Gregorio."  "To the constable's house."  The Confessor said, "We must see to his wounds at once."  ----  The Gypsy woke up with a start, before letting out an oath in his own language as a massive headache hammered from the back of his skull.  He narrowed his eyes against the light, and tried to get his bearings.  He was stricken by that beast... Gregorio looked down at his leg to find it bandaged.  He immediately recognized it as the Confessors handiwork and smiled, at least he was safe.  "So, you're finally awake,"  a vaguely familiar, female voice said.  Gregorio turned his head slowly to spare him any further pain to see Alice, the Constable's daughter.   She was dressed as a woman for once, in a dress that in all honesty, actually made her look feminine., "It took you long enough."  she sniffed, "My father isn't paying you to bleed unconscious on our couch after all."  "Of course."  Gregorio answered, his voice thick with his accent, "I'm sure you could do that all by yourself."   The Gypsy swung his legs down to stand up, as Alice's face registered the insult.  "Don't underestimate my lineage you filthy Gypsy criminal."  Alice replied, her eyes hateful as she watched Gregorio stand, "I'll have you know that our family comes from a distinguished line of hunters and soldiers, no matter what my father looks like."  Gregorio ignored that line, his headache overriding the need to trade barbs with the spiteful wench instead sucking air through clenched teeth.  "Where are the others?"  he asked.  "Out, trying to act competent."  Alice said, her temper cooling down a bit, "Your shirt and your knives are on the table over there." she pointed, "They say they've slain one of the beasts,  and that they were not Lycanthropes."  Gregorio nodded, and then winced at the headache, reaching out to take his shirt and slipping it over his head, "Thorne and I managed to run into one."  he said, "Apparently it has poison in it's claws."  he said, looking down at the bandages that marred his perfectly good pair of pants.  "No matter, perhaps Lady du Winter's magic can do something to the others."  "That witch?"  Alice asked, "Why  is  she with you anyway?  I thought the Penitents were reformed criminals... so why is she still practicing her witchcraft?"  "Because she is the lesser evil."  Gregorio replied, wearing his knives, "She may practice the ways of a Witch, but she has the heart and honor of a lady."  "She nearly choked me to death with that vile spell of hers!"  Alice accused.  "You deserved it."  Alice was about to say something when Gregorio looked at her, "Rather than insulting us, why don't you try something useful for a change?"  he asked, smirking before he walked past her and outside to find the others.  Alice looked on as the door closed with a dull thud, and looked up to the portrait of her grandfather on the far wall.  "We'll see about that."  she said.  ----   I'm guessing that this will be a surprise to some people, I know it's not much compared to the previous installments, but hey, at least  something's  moving on this end. :)  I'm trying to get back into the groove of writing, so please send me any remarks on the story, I need all the criticism I can get  :)

          Rationals, are the problem solving temperament, particularly if the problem has to do with the many complex systems that make up the world around us. Rationals might tackle problems in organic systems such as plants and animals, or in mechanical systems such as railroads and computers, or in social systems such as families and companies and governments. But whatever systems fire their curiosity, Rationals will analyze them to understand how they work, so they can figure out how to make them work better.  In working with problems, Rationals try to find solutions that have application in the real world, but they are even more interested in the abstract concepts involved, the fundamental principles or natural laws that underlie the particular case. And they are completely pragmatic about their ways and means of achieving their ends. Rationals don't care about being politically correct. They are interested in the most efficient solutions possible, and will listen to anyone who has something useful to teach them, while disregarding any authority or customary procedure that wastes time and resources.  Rationals have an insatiable hunger to accomplish their goals and will work tirelessly on any project they have set their mind to. They are rigorously logical and fiercely independent in their thinking--are indeed skeptical of all ideas, even their own--and they believe they can overcome any obstacle with their will power. Often they are seen as cold and distant, but this is really the absorbed concentration they give to whatever problem they're working on. Whether designing a skyscraper or an experiment, developing a theory or a prototype technology, building an aircraft, a corporation, or a strategic alliance, Rationals value intelligence, in themselves and others, and they pride themselves on the ingenuity they bring to their problem solving.  Rationals are very scarce, comprising as little as 5 to 10 percent of the population. But because of their drive to unlock the secrets of nature, and to develop new technologies, they have done much to shape our world.  The Four types of Rationals are:  Architects (INTP) | Masterminds (INTJ) | Inventors (ENTP) | Field Marshals (ENTJ)  ----  Thanks to Mitch for pointing out this test!  you can try it  urlLink   here!

       While tinkering with the new template I used for this blog, I realized that the little Blogger ads on top can be thought of as a personality meter.  Blogger takes note of the little things that you write on each post, reading into your interests and subconscious and using that offer you products that will most likely interest you.  Fascinating.  Okay, so I blame my strange sleep schedule for thinking that up, but hey, it gives people something to ponder whenever they see the ads on their blogs...

       Well, talk about a big surpise.  I get home from work this morning, trying to sort out some overseas family stuff involving ebay and credit cards and I find an email from the Webster's Online Dictionary saying that a few stories I've written have been picked to be part of their references to modern literature on the use of a few words.  All I can say is, wow.  I know it's still not the same as a written page in it, but at least now I can say that I'm in a dictionary. :D  If you're interested, they're over  urlLink   here    and  urlLink   here.

       If you guys are wondering on the sudden change of description on my blog, it's a little about how I feel right now.  After my birthday and all, and with my new job and the change in my home life and the experiences I've had, I think it's time for me to get to work.  I'm realigning my Chakras, finding my source, seeking enlightenment, sailing for new horizons and questing for the Holy Grail.  Not necessarily in that order, and more often all at once.  I've had enough fooling around.  My mistakes are done and over with, and my experiences will always be a part of me.  Now it's actually time to work towards Maslow's favorite part of his heirarchy.  Self-Actualization.  While it's true that I'll still have to contend with everything else in that damn heirarchy, I feel more than a nudge towards seeking something else.  Call it ambition or madness, but I can sense that there's something waiting for me, beckoning me to find it.  I feel like an Arthurian knight errant, lost in the woods with nothing but his steed, and his sword, and faith in the existence of the Holy Grail.  I can't define my Holy Grail to you, to be honest, because I can't even define it to myself as of yet.  I just know that it's there.  And that somehow,  all is right with the world.

       Well, since I had nothing else better to do, here are a few old stories I've written in my old web journal.  I figure that I might as well move them here for redundancy, and as a reminder for me to keep writing.  It's funny how you read something you've written from before, and realize how well you actually wrote them, or how badly they turned out after all. :p  ---   Despair  by Jay Steven Anyong  "Greetings," spoke the old sage, his snowy beard trembling with his quavering voice, "what dark thoughts ail you, young man?"  I turn to look at him, dressed in the luminous robes of a scholar, holding a long inkbrush as tall as I was, "Hello, Great Sage." I greet in response, "I was merely musing about the nature of despair."  "Ah." The old man nodded slowly, "Despair... such a powerful emotion for the young."  "For the young?" My eyebrow shot up, "Explain yourself, Great Sage."  "Despair is at it's most powerful, when one experiences it for the first time." the Great Sage said, sitting down with some difficulty on a small rock beside me.  "The first time?" I snorted, "That's comforting. You've only informed me that there will be others."  "Verily," the Great Sage replied, "There will be many more times when you will be awash with despair and hopelessness... however, there is a lesson to be learned in all our experiences."  "And this lesson is...?"  "That despair, while seemingly overwhelming, is but a passing shadow to one who looks towards the light." The Great Sage replied, looking out into the horizon, "Only cowards turn to violence upon others and themselves in the grip of despair. True virtue shines in those who brace themselves and conduct themselves with humility, grace, honesty and love, for those four are what will give you the strength to bend with the storm of despair and grow with it's passing."  I listened quietly, my heart and mind at war with each other.  The Great Sage looked at me and smiled, "My words are of little comfort, as they should be, young man. For my words cannot grant you humility, nor grace, nor honesty nor love. These can only come from you."  I nodded. My mind agreed, and my heart sighed with sadness.  The Great Sage was right. Mere words cannot take me away from my despair. Like an alchemist, I must seek to rise above the base and ascend to the divine.  I bow low to the Great Sage, and hoist my pack over my shoulder looking out into the coming storm.  ----   Cold Shower  by Jay Steven Anyong  He sang.  Throwing his head back, his eyes squeezed shut, feeling the icy water of the shower biting into the skin of his bare chest, he sang.  He sang a song of loneliness and of heartbreak even as he bowed his head, feeling the sharp sting of cold water on his scalp, before trickling down and raking his back like little claws, trailing their way down from his shoulders to the small of his back.  Warm tears streaked down his face as his voice cracked, a soft sob escaping his lips as he took a shuddering breath to sing the next line. The warmth of his tears washed away by another icy blast of cold as he reached the chorus.  He opened his eyes, forcing them to focus as the cold gripped him tighter. He sang harder, his voice getting louder as he looked down at the blood seeping down the drain, swirling around like a little crimson whirlpool.  He gasped, his next breath seemed so hard to draw...  He sang softly as he felt his knees give, and the razor fell from his hand, clattering on the bleached white tiles of the shower floor, as he finally felt his voice waver, no sound coming from his mouth.  He gave a sad smile as he felt his vision begin to fade, ending his song with her name, lost in the sound of the icy cold water hitting bleached white tiles

       Well, it looks like my body clock hasn't completely adjusted after all.  I'm awake two hours early typing out this blog trying to figure out how to knock myself out into lala land again.  Oh well.  Since I'm here anyway, might as well make my half-awake state useful.  ----    You're a Speak & Spell!!  You nerd, you.  Just because you were disguised as a toy doesn't mean you weren't educational, you sneaky bastard.    urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Great.  I'm a Nerd Toy.  ----  Well, then again I am technically a Gamer Geek, so I guess I'm not really offended.  Heck, I play RPGs and miniatures games and all sorts of other stuff that people would consider to be "toys".  (Okay, minds out of the gutter to those who are thinking of other toys right now.)  Heck, I guess proof of this would be the fact that my favorite game , Mage: the Ascension, deals with heavy Philiosophy and a lot of high weirdness, conspiracy theories, religious conflict and the power of the singluar world view.  The basic premise of the game is this:  If you realized the spark of divinity within you, and found that you could use it to rewrite reality... what would you do??  Would you take advantage of it to make yourself rich? Will you solve world hunger?  Would you explore the extent of your abilities?  will you make yourself into a celebrity?  Would you pimp yourself out to first world countries?  That's what Mage is about. :)  It's about people who've found the ability to alter reality, and the things they have to go through in pursuit of their goals.  Be it power, love, happiness or salvation. :)  A little heavy on the reading, but excellent stuff. :)   oh, and just out of curiosity, if you guys are interested, can you guys take this quiz and tell me what you guys got? I think I can learn a lot out of the results of these.  Most of the Game Bandits and Kirsikka already know the results they want, but I'm also curious about the guys who  don't  play Mage     You are a Euthanatos, bound to the Wheel of Fortune.  Others label you a "death mage", but they do not see the necessity of destruction, or how it allows new creation. That is the burden you must bear, along with the tragedy of Jhor: hold up your faith in your vocation, lest you lose sight of your reason for being, or worse, become a mindless killer. You stand on the knife's edge, balancing between extremes; your will must be strong indeed to balance the universe with you in the face of ridicule.    urlLink   Which Tradition Mage Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       Well, it looks like I've pulled off part of my sleep pattern modification program, having spent the entire night awake until now.  I'll hit the sack at around 6 or so, and hopefully my body will get enough sleep to prepare me for the night shift training that's starting tonight.  I've had some time to think about what I wrote last night.  I guess I needed to blow off some steam...  Thankfully the blog is designed for this kind of stuff.  At least I don't have to take up too much of other people's time with my bitching. :p  So to make up for it, here's a cute and simple strip from  urlLink   Sinfest!

       No sleep No sleep until I'm done with finding the answer Won't stop Won't stop before I find the cure for this cancer  Sometimes I feel like going down, I'm so disconnected Somehow I know that I am haunted to be wanted  I've been watching, I've been waiting In the shadows for my time I've been searching, I've been living For tomorrows all my life   In the shadows  by The Rasmus  ----  Sometimes I wish that I could change the world.  Sometimes I feel that I could take away pain.  Sometimes I think that I can give all the answers.  Sometimes I'm told that I'm just fooling myself.  It's hard living a life where you just want other people to be happy.  I've always been accused of being too much of a pushover and of trying too hard to please everyone.  I think that they might be right.  I get twinges of guilt when I see someone I consider to be a friend struggling through a situation.  I feel the call to reach out and help in any way possible...  Even if it may be wrong for me to do so.  Maybe I'm a wimp.  Maybe I'm a pushover.  Maybe I find gratification and some semblance of place in the world by the way that I am percieved.  Perhaps this is all a little selfish streak in me that wants to be noticed and praised for being a good little boy.  Or it could even be the plain vanilla explanation that I just want to  help .  A good friend of mine dubbed it the "Hero complex".  I think she hit it right on the head.  There's a little buzz you get when you help people out, and there's a corresponding pain of guilt when you feel that you're responsible for someone else's suffering.  Maybe I should learn to care selectively.  That might do the trick.  Care only when it is convenient to do so.  Help only when you will not lose anything while doing so.  Listen to those who would be able to repay you for your kindess.  Expect something in return.  Yeah, right.  I'm not like that.

        urlLink     I've always thought that the coolest thing in mainstream comic books was the Gotham universe.  Here's a little pic showing the current crop of people which are making waves in Gotham, though I have to admit that Catwoman's new "goggle" costume seems a little... off to me.  Also included are some of my other favorites, Barbara Gordon as the Oracle, Tim Drake as Robin, Nightwing and Helena Bertinelli as the Huntress.  I'm actually rather tempted to see if I can dig up the Hush storyline sometime.

       Great, 24 now and still going.  :p  I guess nothing much to write about honestly,  aside from the fact that I've managed to get my  urlLink   co-worker's deadjournal    address and I'm putting it up on my sidebar as a link.  Shar's a pretty cool girl, and from the looks of it, she does poetry a hell of a lot better than I do.  Which is probably also why I stick to prose.  For other links, here's  urlLink   Lara's website   .  Lara was our instructor for the Sykes Core Skills Training module, and it turns out that she's friends with more than a couple of AEGIS people, Adrian, Nabs and Tommy Lim.  Small world, I guess.  ---  I really should get back to writing.  Maybe living with only the night to guide me will help out in bringing the angsty, moody, and melodramatic stuff out of me.  ;)  I'll end up as a coffee zombie, with dark circles under my bloodshot eyes, my hair haggard and unkempt, drooping over my face as I walk down the streets of Makati.  I can't wait.  Then again, I have to admit that Gothic stuff has it's appeal.  I'm not a full goth by any means, but I find the culture fascinating.  Then again, I'm a big fan of the whole World of Darkness, so big surprise, right?

          You are most like Robin! A leader and fearless by nature, you tend to dive straight into something without thinking. You have a hard time trusting your friends sometimes and you are extremely serious when you have to. You don't like being compared to someone you are a rival with and sometimes your temper gets the best of you. Out of all of your friends you might be the one who dreams to be leader or is the leader.

       Hmm...    It looks like that blogger is getting more and more complicated by adding more features to dress up the posts. Not that I mind, but it does tempt one to spend more time sprucing up the posts with colors and stuff now that it's easier to do.    Anyway, first of all I'd like to repost the Mage: the Ascension Quiz for the benefit of my co-workers who are interested in the game. It might help you guys with what Tradition in the game fits your natural perception of the world best:    Here's my result for today (it varies on my mood apparently)      Rock on; you're a Cultist of Ecstasy.  Magic is the result of moving beyond the limitations of the human form, the constraints of body, mind, and perception.  You do this through EXPERIENCE: the physical, the emotional, and the spiritual. Chances are you're rebellious, artistic, philosophical, radical, meditative, or all of the above.  Most people see you as a hippie, a druggie who sees "enlightment" in a ketamine haze, but you merely rediscover what the ancients saw in the natural world: rhythms that are gateways to the trance state, through which anything is possible.     urlLink   Which Tradition Mage Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Whoa... never got this result before.

       Well, it looks like that the  urlLink   Crimson Skies    packs I've ordered from ebay just arrived today, and I have to say that it's satisfying to open a package and sift through foam peanuts in order to see six factory fresh packs all still sealed in there.  I've developed a liking for the Crimson Skies universe ever since I've heard of it.  Originally a board game from FASA Corporation, it's a game based in an alternate version of the United States of 1937, with a few drastic changes. As their blurb puts it:    "The year is 1937. The United States has shattered under the weight of the Great Depression, regional Prohibition and mounting isolationism. The transcontinental railroad and the budding highway system have become useless as they now cross hostile borders. Commerce and trade leave the ground as air travel—once a national obsession—now becomes a vital lifeline connecting allied countries. Giant zeppelins crisscross the skies, carrying both passengers and cargo. It is a time of gunship diplomacy and airship piracy. It is the age of the fighter pilot and a time of daredevil adventure and sinister intrigue. It is the world of  Crimson Skies… "   The game focuses primarily on pulp action and dogfights with miniatures.  I'm not lucky enough to have discovered this game when it was still coming out from FASA, so I got the next best thing.  It turns out that  urlLink   Wizkids    came out with a simpler, miniatures based version, and that's the game that I picked up.  Alas, it looks like Wizkids is also putting the brakes on the production on other expansions on the game (apparently it's a niche thing) so I'll have to content myself with the ones that I already have.  ----  On other notes,  I've been taking a few live calls already for the past two days.  So far the experience has been interesting, though I don't really have all that many funny stories to relate yet.  I'm pretty sure that'll come in time, once I start taking calls full time.  Getting a hang of the system that we're using at work takes a bit of practice, and I find myself trying to figure out how to handle an issue as effectively as possible.  My trainer wasn't kidding when she said that the work we'd be doing would be relatively complicated compared to the other accounts.  We're sort of operating as part researchers, part customer care and part educators.  It's not enough that we find what the hell went wrong, we have to make sure the customers don't get pissed and tell them what they have to do and what we'll be doing to fix their issues.  So far,  I think I'm doing okay, but I'm pushing myself to learn how to do things faster and more efficiently.  I'm planning to work my ass off all day, and apply to any and every promotion that rears it's head in my presence.

       I just got my finals results today, and I'm really happy about it.  Passing was what was on my mind while taking it, but it turned out that I got 98%!  That's just the beginning though.  Tonight, I'll be taking on real calls for the first time,  and technically that's when I get to see how things are on the floor for real.  ----  Speaking of beginnings, we ran into a group of D&D gamers in Greenbelt 3 last weekend, and it turns out that they're a relatively new group to the hobby.  I've invited them to the AEGIS mailing list, and it looks like they're all hyped about the prospect of meeting new people and trying new games.  Now I remember why I became a semi-active advocate of the hobby.  It's not enough that I enjoy the games I run (or play in), but I want to share the experience with other people.  There's a lot more to these games than just rolling dice and drawing looks from other tables in greenbelt when we announce our character's actions, or speak in character.  It's fun, and that's exactly what I want to share.  Besides, the more the hobby supports it's fans, the greater the amount of money goes into the hobby, driving down prices, and expanding the diversity of games.  It's a win-win situation for me.  I'm sure that most of the hobby store owners will agree with me.  In the long run, what makes a game sell is the fact that there's a community for it. Playing is a social activity for the most part, and like kids, if there's nobody to play with, it just won't be fun anymore.  What I'm hoping though, is that we can sustain their interest and their continued participation in the AEGIS community.

       Finals today.  This is the other "Make-or-Break" part of training for my new job.  I'm not really nervous, but I'm pretty sure that I'd still need good luck.  I've studied, and I've got little mental notes floating about my mind right now on little reminders, rules and things not to forget.  This is as ready as I'll ever be.  Wish me luck?  ----  On the hobby end of things, I came upon this  urlLink   review    of Mage: the Ascension as a game line in general, dealing with the themes and changes of the game from its initial incarnation over to the revised edtion that currently graces my shelves.

       Sometimes people get handed the short stick.  Saturday morning came with a rather sad announcement from those who were taking the English assessment tests for the call center I'm working for.  Of the six that took the test, three were taken out.  One of them was ecstatic, the other indignant, and the last quietly accepted the event.  After much haggling, our trainer managed to pull the indignant one out of the fire, but the quiet one was denied a second chance by the people above.  She joins the two others who have left before, but for a different reason, and to be honest, I can't help but feel sad about the whole affair.  I'm just hoping that the rest of those in training with me do extremely well in the finals on Tuesday.  I'll be working my ass off to score as high as I possibly can.

       I guess it just occured to me that I don't really write much about my life here in this blog.  Most of the time it's about my hobbies, or with random musings that I've come up with.  While that's all fine and good, I can't help but wonder why I don't seem to have much to put up here.  Right now, I'm living in a curious sort of zen-state.  I've learned to deal with the pressures of work, the issues at home, and my responsibilities as a friend, companion, significant other and game master.  I've dealt with everything the world has tossed at me at one time or another, various paradigm shifts that have decimated my expectations and beliefs at fundamental levels.  A few of the lessons I've learned are the simple ones that everyone should learn at one time or another:  - Learn who your true friends are and cherish them, nurture your relationship with the deserving, and you will also be elevated to their stature.  - Public opinion is hardly ever an accurate indication of anything.  Most people are too concerned thinking about what other people think that they lose themselves.  You forge your identity, be proud of your handiwork.  - Inspiration is a rare and wonderful thing.  No matter what the cause, run with it, play it out, write it down or put it on paper.  Everyone has the soul of an artist, it's just a matter of applying what you feel to a medium of expression.  - Words are good, but we take deeds.  Honest and sincere intent, coupled with words and promises are only the beginning.  The rest of it comes from good, hard work.  - What seem to be great sacrifices now, reap greater rewards later.  Karma comes and goes, often hitting you in the back of the head when you least expect it.  - Time is money.  Hence if you can pay with time, rather than money, do so.  It allows you to spend your current cash on more important things.  - Cattle prods are the wave of the future.  Do not hesitate to zap fools if they approach you.  If enough of us do it, it will become socially acceptible by the principle of common usage. (taken from Dilbert)  It's not much admittedly, but I guess it's a start.  I mean twenty four years of living is probably not what most people would consider to be a long time, but I think that these things are worth bearing in mind.  what do you guys think?

       Okay, here's my take on Enchantresses and Sorceresses in general as I mentioned in the last entry.  Personally, I find the Enchantress more endearing primarily because of the fact that they need not resort to crude methods such as the promise of violence (although they  can  if they really want to.  While I will admit that the term, "Sorceress" is really a catch-all for women who cast magic, I find that the Enchantress has enough merit to stand on her own.  The Myths are full of women who have used magics that fall under the umbrella of Enchantment rather than the more direct magic attributed to other practices.  Take Medea from Jason and the Argonauts, for example.  Her  urlLink   exploits    paint her as not the kind of woman you'd like to anger, but she admittedly has style... even if she exhibited a kind of sly murderous streak that most modern individuals would consider to be mentally disturbed.  In most fantasy literature, Enchanters and Enchantresses usually get the job done with the judicious use of wit, cunning and charm.  Rarely relying on destructive forces, they empower objects (like the ever popular magical swords), brew potions, and achieve a form of mental domination over people.  There is hardly ever a grand display of special effects of light and sound, but the results are still as potent.  I guess I'm writing this as a tribute to the other side of the Arthurian mythos.  While the Knights are certainly those that set off (often with only courage as their only companion) on their Quests, it is the role of the Wizards, and the Enchantresses to provide them strength.  Even as Circe helped Odysseus, Medea assisted Jason, and the Lady of the Lake watched over King Arthur, no epic is complete without the wise, cunning and sometimes frightening female enchantress watching from the shadows.  It's certainly something to think about as I go on with life, knowing that somewhere, the Enchantress is waiting for me to find what I've been questing for.

       Yes, for the first time in my life, I've actually had a chance to celebrate the Fourth of July for a real reason. :)  Working for a call center with a US Bank as an account sort of allows for that kind of thing.  I know it's a minor thing, especially since most of the Philippines' three day weekends are now working days (or nights, rather) for me, but I like to celebrate things for the heck of it.  ---  A guilty pleasure of mine is to sift through several Art Boards such as  urlLink   the Sijun Boards    or  urlLink   Conceptart.Org    for pictures that grab my attention or grand inspiration for my RPG games.  The picture in my previous post came from one of those boards.

I really like the whole Chinese vibe she has going on with the details of her costume.  For some reason, I find myself liking Enchantresses more than I like Sorceresses (is there such a word?)  Blame it on my fascination on the Arthurian mythos again, but I find the Enchantresses seem to have a hell of a lot more style and finesse than a sorceress.  While a Sorceress may call down lightning or fry her foes with fireballs, an enchantress doesn't have to go that far to achieve her ends.  Heck, an enchantress makes a great friend,  just don't go pissing her off.  Anyway, I'd go more into this discussion on Enchantresses vs. Sorceresses when I get back.  Gotta head off to work.  Catch you guys tomorrow!

          If there's something that this picture reminds me of, it's a roleplaying game that I'm really fond of called Exalted.  I'd go into detail, but rather than bore you guys, it's a game about demigods elevated by their deities to perform feats of greatness and bringing about change in the world.  The game itself styles it's heroes in a similar fashion to the Mythical heroes that we only see in books (and in very few movies, like Troy).  These are individuals with incredible power, and yet possess crippling hubris and failings that can make their losses into tragedies that sweep entire nations.  While I'm a big fan of the Epic storyline and world-sweeping adventures, I also appreciate the smaller things in RPG worlds.  In Exalted for example, I'm currently playing a Zenith Caste Priest King.  It's my first time to play something that even remotely looks religious (even in game terms) but I find that my character spends more time trying to forge bonds in his community and fostering the love and trust of his people rather than going out and fighting the good fight.  Which is odd considering that he's fashioned to be a cross between the  urlLink   Rock in "the Scorpion King"    and  urlLink   Moses from "Prince of Egypt"    carrying a 5-foot long golden ceremonial warclub.  You'll see once I get Nicco to scan an image of my character. :)

       Virtue is more to man than either water or fire. I have seen men die from treading on water and fire, but I have never seen a man die from treading the course of virtue.      Confucius, The Confucian Analects   ----  The man's got a point.  Of course, the saying points to men of virtue in their daily lives.  Martyrs and patriots who die in the service of their beliefs are exempt from this. :p

        You are  Optimus Prime!     Vast, red and ready to turn into a lorry at the slightest provocation, you are a robot to be reckoned with. Although sickeningly noble, you just can't resist a good interplanetary war, especially when Orson Welles is involved. You have friends who can shoot tapes from their chests. Tapes that turn into panthers. And other friends who are dinosaurs. Dinosaurs who jump out of planes. Will you have my children?    Tell the world you're an Autobot with the following non-heat-sensitive sticker:   urlLink     urlLink Which Colossal Death Robot Are You?    urlLink Brought to you by Rum and Monkey    ----  Woohoo!   Autobots, transform!

       Hey guys!  Just wanted to make sure that people still know that I'm alive.  The night shift has done nothing to aid in my blogging to be honest, as my schedules revolve around getting to work, working, and crashing to bed when I get home.  It doesn't leave much to be done, believe me.  I'm starting to think that the sun actually fuels people similarly to plants.  Even with the same amount of hours in a day, working in night shift tends to screw with your energy levels.  ----  Work-wise I think I'm doing okay though.  Got two commendations for getting "happy customers" over the phones this week, which is most likely a freak accident of being lucky enough to get callers who ask to speak to your supervisor to say something  good  for a change.  It's an interesting experience to be honest.  But I think I need a lot of stress release.  You can't always avoid speaking with people which will teach you just how limited your patience is.  Because I'm working in customer support, I've experienced being shouted at for just greeting a customer, getting scathing insults and generally trying to smooth over ruffled feathers, all while trying to maintain an average talk time of 5.25 minutes.  Hey, at least I'm earning money.  ----  Going to be in Arnis today, and I think that's a good thing.  While I'm usually a lazy bum who couldn't be bothered to get out of my chair, I think hitting things is a good way to release stress.  I'm not that good at it though, and I'm pretty sure that somewhere my instructor is still a tad disappointed at my lack of mobility.  I do make a good training dummy apparently.  I don't flinch from near hits in demonstrations.  ----  Gaming wise, I'm thinking of how to plan a game for once.  While I'm confident with my abilities as a GM, I do tend to be on the low end of the planning side, and thus some of my games seem to lack the same amount of detail and focus that the other GMs have.  I'm not ambitious enough to think that I can run a gigantic epic on the fly, and so I'd better get to rolling up my sleeves and learning to sit down and plan for it. :p  Seeker #4 article is done as well, and I'm looking forward to seeing it in print eventually.  ----  Man, I'm grateful for weekends.  It's the time when friends are there to keep me sane.  The lack of actual social contact with people outside the office is driving me just plain nuts.
