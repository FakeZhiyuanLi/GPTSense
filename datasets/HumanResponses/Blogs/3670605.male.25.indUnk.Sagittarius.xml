      Ok.  So, I'm writing this with some sort of vague idea that anything I write, think or do is of any interest to anyone else other than me.  But on the off chance that someone's interested:    I live in Edinburgh in the UK.  At the moment in the UK there are two things happening that are REALLY important.  The papers are full of two things. You might think it was the disastrouss local/European election results (just what is it about Europe we're so scared of any way?), or the news that in the U.S. an official report has just been released that basically says that the White House (and therefore, more specifically George Bush) was wrong about Iraq's involvement with the 9/11 incident, or the new law that's going to ban young people from hanging out in the streets (as if they've got anywhere else to go!).  But it's not.  There are two much more important things going on in the UK.  Things of such mind boggingly huge proportions that if you were able to find some way of linking the two things together we might finally have an idea just how huge infinity is.    The first of these two world destroying colossi is the European Cup. Now, please understand I love football (or if there are any American's reading this, soccer).  I'm English and I want England to do well.  I will watch all the games I can.  I will listen to Graham Taylor talk crap at half time.  I will shout and probably swear at the screen when things go wrong.  BUT when the leading story of the news, is about the football when SO MUCH is going on at the moment, it's just mad.    The papers would be full of the football if it wasn't for the even bigger event going on at the moment.  I am talking of course,about Big Brother. You know, the programme where a group of stereotypes talk about themselves all day whilst we gawp at them like goldfish that have lost the will to live.  WHY is Big Brother so popular? It just annoys me that we spend so much money on what is basically the equivalentt of putting two dogs in a pit and throwing one bone in to see who will get it and which dog will get killed in the process [please note, I'm not recomending this as entertainment].  It's pointless, uninteresting and futile.  The people in there are SO uninteresting.  It's obvious that the tv company's just after ratings.  It's almost obscene that it's even on BUT I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING!  I'm hooked. Everyone's talking about it and even as I'm sat with a group of friends moaning about wasting our time watching it, I want to know what's going to happen next.  I want to see them have a fight and fall out.  What's wrong with me?  I know it's utter rubbish but I can't help watching it.  I need help.
