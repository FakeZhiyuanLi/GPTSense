       Hmmm...sitting here, chatting off-hand w/people I'd rather not be talking with. (just being honest!!!). So, the one-sidedness of this blog is kindof pleasing right now. HAHA...im talking and you're not....and there's nothing you can do about it...meh  I spent most of my day playing video games, and  waiting for a call . So, nothing exciting i guess. I mean, there's only so much satisfaction one can get from taunting and yelling at the characters on the screen.  ("haha...just try and shoot me NOW...i dare ya")  All the while blowing each one to bits with one of the 15 guns your man can carry. (ive always wondered...where does he put them...*scratches head). I'm not saying i dont enjoy the games...i just prefer human contact. It's kinda nice...all warm and fuzzy.  (still waiting for a call)  I must be one of the most indecisive persons out there. I havent been able to make up my mind lately. Honestly, I feel like...i have mush for brains sometimes. I can't decide where to eat, where to go,...who to date. (*hits head on desk) Maybe if i wasnt so scared of getting hurt, or so worried about pleasing other people...i could be more assertive......less of an idiot. Oh well...  -The Rose  (still waiting for a call)

       So...I went to this jazz festival thing tnite...it was kinda fun. We basically just layed around and enjoyed the jazzy-goodness. Every once in a while, we'd see some strange old man walk by, and we'd giggle. Not in a cruel manner...we were just somehow amused. It could've been the neon blue sweater....or maybe the little wallet chain hanging out of his pants.....or even, his comical shuffle. (It could've been just girls and a bunch of sugary ice-cream....maybe thats a bad combination from the start). At any rate, we found the whole experiance entertaining.    (especially seeing Gracie do the awkward dance...*grins and shakes head).      -The Rose

        Well....i had yet another lovely morning, as i awoke to the sounds of my little brother's friends. (not exactly something i wanted to wake up to...the shrill voices of pre-pubescent boys.). But now that I'm awake...i feel compelled to do all these random things.       Out of all the random things on my mind this morning...the worst was a strong need to "return to middle-earth???" (Not only is it entirely impossible....but ive never really been there in the  first  place.....so how could i return??? Im so confused)      I blame the whole "middle-earth thing" on the crazy dream i had. As far as i remember, I was a hobbit...traveling with some really tall man named.....Ventorn??? Apparently, we were wandering through the Shire, searching for....something important (*scratches head). Then, suddenly a strange man wearing...a lion suit...jumps out of the bushes. The lion/man was clearly asking for a beating, so Ventorn clopped him on the head while I (the stupid hobbit) ran around in circles. After Ventorn and I had beaten the living daylights out of the lion/man,...we then proceeded to the "NEXT LEVEL."       Very strange. (*ponders the insanity....then shrugs)      I must go...barbershop calls to me....: )    -The Rose

       (So...thanks to Gracie for putting these crazy ideas into my head. Too much of reading your posts i suppose. Ah well,...maybe it'll be good for me. : ) Who knows.)  Once again...waking up did not appeal to me today. It's nice under the covers....all safe and cozy-like. After all, there's no need for forced smiles, and happy-go-lucky attitudes when no one's around to watch. As long as I stay buried under layers of blankets and fluffy, white pillows...nothing can hurt me. That's my theory.  It used to be a good theory too...worked nicely...but not today. I guess there was just too much on my mind. Too many bad experiances to stiffle with covers alone. Even the pillows failed to drown out the noise of unpleasant memories. (*shakes fist at pillows).  So i just sat around....staring blankly....thinking WAY too much for my own good. Wondering why things dont work out, and people change. How distance, difference, and time has a way of messing with you....playing with your emotions. How joy can slip through your fingers in seconds....and sorrow can grab hold of you for what seems like an eternity.  Do we live for the seconds?  No, i am not a twisted soul full of dark emotions...im just venting..... (*sigh...great way to make friends kaylyn....just great)       -The Rose
