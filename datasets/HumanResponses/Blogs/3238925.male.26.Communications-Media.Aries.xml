      Start: 9:57 I stared at myself through the shattered mirror. I looked how I felt. The pain in my right hand took the pain away from my heart. Watching the blood drip to the floor from my sliced open hand kept my mind occupied. I could call the doctor's or I could just bleed to death or at least until I passed out. I'm not sure what I would do.  The sound of passing cars bothered my ears.  "Too loud," I said to myself. I could only see one eye reflected in the mirror and that one was barely visible because of the tears almost blinding myself. I placed my hands over my ears and shouted, "TOO LOUD," when a car that passed beneath my second-story apartment window honked it's horn.  The blood coming from my right fist, which I used to use to stroke her hair, began to drip on my pants. I looked at the slice on my knuckles would have required stitches, but there was no way I was going to get them. When enough blood dripped onto the pants and soaked through, I felt the cool sensation of it running on my leg.  I looked at the blood on my pants and it reminded me of our first kiss. She spilled wine onto my lap and tried to clean it off. As soon as she came close, I couldn't resist the smell of her hair or the beauty of her skin. I took her hand, pulled her even closer and kissed her. Now someone else is savoring her hair and skin.  I started feeling woozy from the amount of blood I had lost and sat down on the bed. I had a hard time sleeping there now because it seemed so empty without her. I've tried to hold onto the pillows to try and imitate what it felt like next to her, but the smells, sounds and body warmth I used to sense when laying next to her could not be duplicated. I grabbed the pillow that used to be hers and smelled it. She was still there, but barely. My blood dripped on the pillow.  The phone rang and I rushed to answer it. It wasn't her number that popped up on Caller ID. It was my mother's. After hesitating, I answered.  "What?" I asked.  "How are you feeling?"  "How do you think I'm feeling?"  "I think you need to get out of your place and do something. Sitting there and rotting won't do you any good."  "I don't care what you think," I told her and hung up the phone.  What did I do wrong? I did everything she asked of me. I loved her. I shared every part of myself with her. I asked her to marry me! What else could she have wanted?  She didn't have to say yes and lead me to believe we'd live a long, happy life. She didn't have to make me believe she was the only one in the world for me. She didn't have to come up to me and say that she met someone who shared more of her same values. I shared her same values.  I walked to the bathroom and poured rubbing alcohol over it. It burned and turned my thoughts away from her just for a few moments. Those few moments of freedom made me feel good. Then I wrapped gauze around my fist, went to the couch and fell asleep.  Finished: 10:17

      Start: 11:40 p.m.  I tried to scratch my right leg yesterday, but then I realized that it wasn't there anymore. The doctors amputated more than a year ago after my diabetes made it useless and dangerous to my health.  Since the amputation, I've become even less healthy. Every time I have the phantom pains, I feel like eating and then without access to cardiovascular exercise I am unable to burn off the extra calories. It's a bunch of bullshit. I blame the parents by the way. They shouldn't have fed me so much McDonald's when I was a kid.  But I decided that I'm changing my life today. I met a girl. She's beautiful. Big blue eyes, a smooth face and a voice that sounded like singing even when the words coming out were, "This might hurt a little."  She's my new nurse. Her name is Jennifer. She's from St. Ann's Medical Center.  "So you're the big famous author, eh?" she said when she shook my hand. "Mr. Matt Henderson."  "You got the big part right," I told her.  For the last year I haven't had to leave my home. I have enough money to pay for the nurses. Enough to pay for the medication. Enough to pay for my food.  "You can't eat this," she said holding up a carton of ice cream.  "Bullshit, I can eat whatever I want."  "And this? You trying to kill yaslef?"  "The doctors won't do it for me." This actually made her laugh.  "I don't want you to die. You're a wonderful writer."  At this time, I started noticing her looks. I looked at her left hand and the ringfinger was empty. There wasn't even a tan line on it.  "Not married, huh?" I asked her. "You a lesbo?"  "No," she said tying a rubber cord around my bicep and rubbing my veins with alcohol. "We're not going to talk about my personal life."   That was it. That was the extent of our conversation. She tucked tubes of blood into her bag to have the proper tests performed and walked out the door.  I laid in bed for a few minutes; my heart still beat fast after being energized by Jennifer. I decided to end my shower and bath embargo and rolled myself out of bed into my wheelchair. Then I rolled myself into the bathroom, filled up the tub and rolled myself into the hot-warm water. I thought of her climbing in with me, but realized she wouldn't be able to fit. I was barely able to fit. The only solution: lose enough weight so she and I could both fit in the tub.  Finish: 11:57 p.m.

      Start: 12:21  The woman's name was my first misconception of her. Her deep-set eyes, dark hair and exotic lips made me think her name was something foreign like Xotchilt (say: Sochi) or biblical like Rebekah. But no, her name was Diane. And like her name, there was nothing particularly striking about her personality or background. I expected her to be from Peru or Istanbul. Instead, she was just a valley girl. Yet that didn't stop me from asking her out.  Date 1: Dinner, movies, little kiss. But maybe it was the movies that didn't make me realize how annoying she was. I started getting little hints on the drive home to her house though.  "That was like so good," she said, her deep-set brown eyes now bulging from their sockets.  "Yeah, it was OK," I said, still trying to ignore her annoying hand gestures and hoping that they'd become "cute" the longer I knew her. They didn't.  "Like, when she pulled out her eyeball. Oh my God! That was like crazy," she said. "Didn't you think that was crazy?"  "Yeah, I was shocked."  "I know. I couldn't believe it." Thank goodness she didn't live too far from the theaters. I walked her to her down, she tried to trip me up, I don't know why, but I didn't fall. Then she laughed like a goat. I looked at her a little annoyed, but the way she stared at me reminded me of how hot she was. I took her hand and kissed her on the lips. She giggled and then bounded up her porch and through her front door blowing a kiss as she entered her house.  "What the hell was that date?" I asked myself in my car.  Date 2:  I picked her up for our second date. Dancing this time. She came out of her house looking amazing. She wore a tight, red shirt that hung down her shoulders and a black pants that showed every curve of her muscular legs.  "Hello, darling," she said squeezing up close to me and kissing me on the cheek. "Let's go."  I felt out of my league. I wore black slacks and a collared, button-down blue shirt and looked OK, but she was gorgeous. I wondered what a woman like this was doing going out with a guy like me. Then she talked again.  "Oh my God! My best friend Susie, I told you about her, her boyfriend Dan bought her a new car. It's so nice. Then my friend Janet..." blah, blah, blah. I shut my ears off after about five minutes of blather. I nodded my head and said, "No way!" a few times, but realized what was wrong with her.  We couldn't have gotten to the club any sooner. Valet took my car and she took me in through the VIP door. I was surprised that she had that pull, but then I looked at how beautiful she was it didn't seem so odd.  The salsa music drowned out any type of extended conversation, which was just fine with me. She put her body close to my moving to the thump-thump of the music. She was a great dancer. A few times she brought herself close to me and kissed my neck.  We left about 1 a.m. We were both soaked and exhasted from the dancing when we got in my car. I took her home.  If she didn't say one word on the way home I would consider the date a success and say I had a good time. But I knew that that wouldn't happen.  "Like, did you see that ho wearing the see-through blouse with no bra? What a whore."  I said no, just to seem like it was only her I cared about at the club. This is true too. She was so much more beautiful than any of the other women there.  I walked her to her door again and she asked me to come inside. I knew what would happen if I went inside. We'd kiss, end up touching each other and then end up in her bed. I didn't want that to happen. It'd form a connection with this girl I wasn't sure I wanted.  "I can't. I have to wake up early," I said.  "You can wake up early here," she said as she leaned forward to kiss me.  "I can't." Then I gave her a kiss on the cheek and walked back to my car. She stared at me from her door until I drove away.  I got a call the next night. It was her.  "I don't think we should date anymore," she said.  "Why not?" I asked.  "Well, I'm not really into you. You talk too much and I think all you really want to do is sleep with me. I hope we can be friendly if we ever see each other on the out and about. I'm sorry," she said.  "OK," I said and hung up the phone and went back to sleep.  End: 12:49

      Started: 11:04  I cried when Bob hit me. I didn't want to. I'm much bigger than him. But he came at me so aggresively that by the time I slapped back my nose was bleeding and my testicles hurt because of his knee that he had pressed there.  I'm Jim. They call me "Sissy" or "Sappy" Jim here at work. I'm a pushover. A coward, some would say. But after having my nuts kneed, I think it's time to toughen up a little.  I cried all the way home after what I've come to call "The Beating" took place. When I walked inside my home, my 15-year-old daughter asked me why I looked so down. I told her about the fight.  "So you fought over a donut?" she asked me.  "Not just a donut, but a cherry-filled one," I said. "Plus I was there first and decided it was time for a stand."  "But you instead got your ass kicked?" she replied.  "Watch your language," I said, but it came out as more of a request.  "Can I have $20? I'm going to the movies and then we're going to smoke pot."  My eyes widened and my long, thin 6-foot frame towered over her.  "I'm just joking about the pot, dad. But I do need $20."  I pulled out my wallet and handed her the money. I asked her when she would be coming back. She said not to worry about it, so I didn't.  I sat on my couch and thought of all the times I've be run over by people. Not only at work, but throughout my life. I remember I let my first-grade teacher make fun of me in class and was never able to say anything in response. My first girlfriend crashed my first car, but I didn't have the guts to have her pay for the repairs. When I was in college, I wrote an essay for a friend, but when I asked him for the money he said, "Fuck you," and punched me in the stomach. My wife left because I never challenged her. She felt "guilty" for being married to me while having sex with a handful of other men. And today Bob kicked my ass.  That's it. It was time to make a stand.  I jumped in my car and drove to the gym and signed up. They got me on the "all-club" plan, even though this was the only one in the state. I could've signed up for one that was $20 less per month, but couldn't tell them no.  I hired a personal trainer and after making me do the stair machine for 20 minute, he took me to the weight room. I immediately felt intimidated. There were 40 Bob-like characters walking around. Their muscles bulging, staring at themselves in the mirror. A man grunted when he pressed dumbbells over his head. I had the sudden urge to tell the trainer I made a mistake.  "I can't do this," I told him.  "You can't be intimidated by people forever," he said. He stared at me. His deep, green eyes penetrated me. I could see pain in those eyes. He reached into his back pocket and pulled out a photo. It was a fat kid with a freckled face who had an extemely sad look on his face.  "That's me," the trainer said. "I used to get my ass kicked all the time when I was young. I stayed fat throughout high school too. But I just snapped one day and new that it was my turn to kick some ass."  He told me his story of working out everyday being inspired by the faces of those who picked on him. He said he lost 50 pounds and went from 25 percent body fat to 10 percent.  "I can be like you?" I said.  "You can be a stud," he said.  "I can?"  "You can."  "Can I make Bob my bitch?" I said.  "You can," he said.  Testosterone filled my veins, anger welled in my hands and then I layed down and bench pressed the bar doing 5 repetitions before my arms collapsed with exhaustion.  "You still have a long way to go before you make anyone your bitch," the trainer said.  End: 11:25

      Started: 2:40  "You stupid little bastard." Can't say that. "I wish I could pick you up and toss you ever that fence holding you up solely by your hair." That isn't too diplomatic either.  There is a certain diplomacy needed when writing letters of recommendations, especially when they come as a result of much frustration and anger directed at the boss who not only drove you down the path of madness, but has done so unscathed by any corporate criticism. There needs to be a balance of anger and of thankfulness and of humbleness.  I remember one time when my little bastard boss of mine told me that I was no good at my job. Although I felt like punching him in the nose, I held back and kept the frustation within. Another time the little nazi told me I needed to make work my "No. 1 priority."  F--- that. He could have kissed my ass and sucked on my toes before I put work ahead of family, education and God. Yes, I put "ass" and "God" in the same sentence. You might not like it, but too freaking bad. It's there and it isn't changing.  Anyways, back to the letter of resignation.   Step 1: Be polite. Don't begin with either of the aforementioned salutations. "Little Nazi," although accurate, might not be the most responsible thing to say in a resignation later. Try something like, "Dear Sir, or Dear Mam, or Dear "Little Nazi's real name." Following the initial greeting, which might be difficult, simply state that you are resigning and when it is effective. But don't, I repeat, DON'T use the phrase, "So blow it out your ass!" As in, "Today is my last day, so blow it out your ass." Instead say, "Today is my last day as I am about to pursue other opportunities, so blow it out your ass." Just kidding. I wanted to see if you were paying attention.  Step 2: Make a statement. Maybe your statement is the single line written above, "Today is my last day as I am set to pursue other opportunities." But the statement could be more profound. "I was harassed, harangued and felt like a hackeysack with the way I was kicked around here."  Step 3: Sign your name. Kind of obvious, but if you don't sign your name it isn't really, truly official. A letter without a signed name might signify a practical joke being played on the boss and a reporter.  Step 4: Deliver the letter. This might be the most difficult part of the process. You might want to hit your boss or run him/her over with your car. But that's not wise. Any type of pain on the boss might result in jail time. Instead, stick the letter on your boss's desk and leave it there. Wipe your ass with the envelope if you want to make a statement.  Step 5: Sit at home and wonder if anything you said in your letter of resignation will be taken into account by management.  So that's it! I hope that you can now write a successful letter of resignation whenever you are ready to quit your job.  End: 2:58

      Started: 6:35  I almost talked to a girl today. Almost. I saw her walk into the coffee shop. Tall, lean, Mayan-shaped and colored face. And she smiled at me. Not the smile given to little kids, but the smile that's given to dinner. I almost said something but stopped. I had to be dignified. I pulled up the newspaper and started reading about basketball. I positioned my head and the newspaper just right so that it'd seem like I was reading, but was really staring at her.  She concentrated really hard on her book. Looked like a science book. It looked like a science book I had back in college. Was it?  "Excuse me," I almost said, "is that book for an environmental studies class?"  She would have said, "Sure is."  I would have said, "Who's your teacher?" And next thing I would've known is that she'd be walking down a flower draped aisle with her arm hooked around her father's and I would be standing nervously next to my buddies. My insides already anticipating the end of the wedding and reception.  I decided to concentrate on the article I was reading. It was very interesting. So I moved the newspaper over so that my eyes wouldn't be straining as much. Unfortunately it covered the Mayan princess.  I panicked when I put down the newspaper. She was gone. Stealth-like, my future wife disappeared. I didn't want to seem too alarmed, so I glanced around the room, but didn't see her immediately. Then in the corner of the room I saw a perfectly tanned and trim stomach. She was still reading the science book.  Play it cool, I told myself. She was comfortable in her seat meaning I'd have time to talk to her. So I pulled out one of my books and started reading. I glanced up every once in a while to make sure she was still there. Once my fears were alleviated I continued my reading. One chapter was all I wanted to read. One chapter and then I'd march over and talk to her.  I finished the chapter. Very boring stuff. Then I packed up my bag, flung it across my shoulder and walked toward the door. I glanced in her direction and saw her staring right at me. I didn't know what to do. Say something. Say something. Say something! I smiled back and waved.  The last thing I saw was a surprised/amused look on her face when I walked out the door.  Finished: 6:50

      On a Monday, George W. Bush woke up in Ancient Greece. He thought he'd be at his Crawford, TX ranch, but found himself asleep next to the Parthenon. He looked inside and shrieked when he saw followers placing incense, flowers and&nbsp;dead lambs before the Greek god Zeus.  A tall, thin and bearded man walked up behind him. He placed his hand on W's shoulder. W again shrieked.  "Sinner," the president said.  "What is this sinner?" asked the man.  "You are a sinner," W replied.  "No, I am Socrates."  "Socrates, eh? Sounds like bin Laden to me."  "Who is this bin Laden?" Socrates asked.  " 'Who is bin Laden?' " Bush repeated. "He is only the leader the of the world's evildoers."  "Why is he an evildoer?" Socrates asked.  "Look at him," and at this point, Bush pulled out his wallet and where there should be cash was a bin Laden playing card. "Look at that beard and doesn't even know Jesus."  "I have a beard and don't know this Jesus, am I an evildoer?"  "Do I need to answer that?" Bush asked.  "What should happen to decent people who don't know this Jesus and have beards?"  "They should be bombed."  "Why should they be bombed?"  "Because bearded, non-Jesus knowing people don't know democracy and hate our freedoms."  Socrates opened his eyes wide and looked at W with a curious look.  "You have democracy where you are from?"  "Abso-freakin-lutely."  "Does it work OK with every man voting on every law?"  "Wo there, wait a minute.&nbsp; Every man does not vote on every law. Only people in Congress do that. We don't want there to be complete anarchy," Bush said.  "So you live in a republic?" Socrates asked.  "A democracy," shouted Bush. "Don't give me this 'republic' nonsense."  Socrates shifted his feet and then tilted his head looking at Bush quizically. "But if only a few vote for the entire country, that is&nbsp;a republic, is it not?"  Bush seemed speechless. "We try to prevent colored people from voting too," Bush added. He seemed to hope that this will add to the weight of his democracy argument.  "Ah," Socrates said. "So keeping the colored people from voting is good for your repub---, I mean democracy?"  "Hell yeah, except for the Democrats. They like the colored people voting."  "So the Democrats are in favor of everyone voting for every law?"  "No, the Democrats are pretty much like us Republicans. Wait, I guess we do live in a republic."  Socrates now seemed to be getting frustrated with Bush's lack of straight answers. He knew what&nbsp;a republic and democracy were, but this man with the weird accent didn't, but tried to act like he did. Socrates looked at Bush and noticed that the man's eyes seemed to be lacking depth. They stared straight ahead, but seemed to be looking at nothing, but kept mouthing, "Evildoers will die." Socrates, who enjoyed talking to everyone decided that this man was not worth talking to.&nbsp;Socrates looked at him one last time; Bush now seemed to be trying to catch flies with his mouth. Socrates then turned and walked away. He heard the man shout "evildoer" a few times, but ignored him.  "I'm glad he'd never be placed in charge of our republic," he said.

      2:57  I jumped off a building. Your life really does flash before your eyes. At first it seemed fortunate I didn't do much in my life to regret jumping. Then I remembered Beth. Beth. Paris. Beth.  Too bad I wouldn't see her again. Her caramel skin, her dark eyes, dark hair. That smile. I couldn't believe a woman could have so many teeth. And white!  I thought about the smells. Italian restaurants. Vanilla coming from her skin. The cats that lived in her apartment building. The weed her brother would smoke out on the balcony.  Of all the thoughts streaming through my mind I would have thought I would have hit the ground already, but 60 stories I guess is high enough for all of these throughts to come out clearly.  Where was I? Oh yes, Beth and her smell. I remember kissing her the first time and tasting her Big Red gum. I remember kissing her the last time. The rancid smell of someone incapable of rising from her bed. Too weak.  The sensation of falling 90 floors reminded me of the sensation I had when we bungy jumped off that bridge in Arizona. It reminded me of the day we got married. It reminded me of the day she told me about our son and the miscarriage. Of the day she told me about the cancer.  Would I see Beth once I hit the floor? I remember the first time I saw her. It felt like falling. Not like this though. It felt like falling into a pit, but not being sad because this beautiful woman was with me. I remember wanting to grab her and kiss her. I felt like crying because I couldn't believe that this girl actually wanted to talk to me. And then actually wanted to date me. It seemed like a dream. Then I woke up when the doctor gave her six-to-eight months to live.   I looked down and could see the cars approaching so much faster now. They were so much closer. We made love in a car once. It was during that same trip to Arizona and the Grand Canyon. Our hotel room was given to someone else and we were forced to sleep in the car. We put the seats down in the back and popped open the trunk. We cuddled in our sleeping bags and looked up at the stars. It was so clear. Not like home. Everything seemed so clear. I could've spent every single moment for the rest of my life there. I felt like Adam and she was my Eve.  "Kiss me," she said. And I did. I kissed her and then she climbed on top of me. A shooting star screamed across the firmament.  Please, Lord, make this moment last forever. Please, Lord.  I could see the faces of the people on the ground. Shear horror. I knew the feeling they had. I went through it. But no more. No more. No...  Done: 3:14

      Start: 11:50  As Tom slid the envelope over to Bob, he gently placed his 9 mm handgun on the table.  "This is enough, Bobby," Tom said. "If it's not, too fucking bad."  Bob didn't realize it until later in the night, but he had pissed his pants as soon as he saw the gun on the table. He slid his hand forward on the table; he didn't want Tom to see his hand shake. But he had to pick up the envelope to open it.  "There's nothing in here," Bob said. His heart started to beat faster and his hand shook so much he joined his two hands together and placed them on the table right over the empty envelope.  "That's fucking right. Marco said you didn't do the job right. He said that the cops will be able to trace it back to you."  "I thought it was good enough. I used all the resources I had. I'm going to jail, Tom. My family needs money."  "I don't give a fuck about your family, and neither does Marco." At this, Bob's hands stopped shaking and he looked at Tom with hatred in his eyes.  "My family needs to be taken care of." And he shoved off from the table and stood up. He was much larger than Tom and knew that he could take him down in a fight. But Tom had a gun.  Tom reached for the gun and pointed it straight at Bob. "Sit the fuck down, Bob." He motioned with the pistol toward the chair. "I can kill you right now. But we like you. After you do the time we want you to work for us again."  "But what about my family?"  "They'll be taken care of. You wouldn't think we'd let one of our brother's family suffer, do ya? DO YA?" Tom was on his feet. He cocked the pistol and went straight at Bob. Bob scrambled backwards and tripped over a chair and fell on his back. Tom stood over Bob and shoved the pistol onto his forehead. Bob closed his eyes and prayed for the first time in more than a decade. He felt the pistol rise from his forehead and he opened his eyes. Tom had a big smile on his face and had his hand extended toward Bob. "Get the fuck up. I wouldn't kill you. I told you, Marco liked you and wants you to work for him again..." Bob didn't want to work for Marco and he definitely didn't want to work with Tom. He began to feel relieved. "...But you did fuck up," Tom said and raised the pistol.  Bob closed his eyes and waited.  End: 12:05

      Start: 7:43  "Shhh, don't tell anyone," the man told the girl. "It's our little secret."  He moved his hand off of her shoulder and put it on her head, only to tussle the hair.  "Why can't I tell anyone?" asked the girl.  "People will talk and say bad things about us," he said.  The girl, looked at him with tears in her eyes. She leaned over and put her head on his shoulder.  "But why will they talk? Is what we did bad? You said we  had  to do it. Things would only get worse if we didn't."  The man started crying as well.  "If we didn't do it," he said pausing to wipe his eyes. "If we didn't do it, then people will wonder why we didn't."  "He shouldn't have been touching the boy like that, should he have, uncle?" asked the girl,  who was no older than 7.  "Shoot, I got blood on your shoulder," the uncle said. He grabbed the water bottle that he had in the cup holder. The water was warm after sitting there all day. He had the girl pour it over his hands while he rubbed them getting all of the blood off of it. He was about to tell her to take off her shirt but realized it was inappropriate. "I had to do something. They were doing it in front of everyone."  "Will he be OK?" the girl asked.  "I don't think so."  "Are you going to get in trouble?"  "Maybe they'll be easy on me because of what the guy was doing. But we had to do it, right?"  "We had to do it," the girl said.  End: 7:55
