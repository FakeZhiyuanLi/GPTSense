      Onto the East, I die to the Twilight.  The engulfed feeds The crows of the night Conjoin me to the fate of life weakened By Life itself.  Wretched for retribution.  God be Damned with Mercy deep within the Soul of mourning doom.  Human enigma encroached with anarchic  Belonging.  Home, the murder of every Prey in the service of the system.  Roam through the valley of vultures Wherein wholeness breaks diversities Of a world never existing in the mouth  Write the blank, the emptiness of vastness Rejuvenate gloom in the eyes and see Nudity, Freedom.  Walk tread, and fall through Death’s River.  STYX.

      Waves, engulf me I do not want to live Waves, engulf me I have my life damned Waves, engulf me She is gone  Look at me and see none Empty as black, death Have you no heart To beg my love Why have you become silent Are you still there  See me as I am No love for myself My heart is exhausted You drank it all Save me life’s taste  Walk, walk out For my hand is frail I’m soaked with your nothing Could you give me some more 	I could not die Death would only make You a smile I wish I would die For you to smile

      With the sheer cry of the child I glance at nothing and hear him Without remorse, I scream As the sun Fades.  The sea whistling its agony Leaving me in the Dark.  The absence of hope, reverberating through The river, below the land I seek Peace. In the valley of the dead.  The child is now at my grasp I welcome his presence and his Death.

      “We will be together again in this world or the next.”  	They never found her body.  It was as if the sea’s emptiness welcomed her death.  It was so like her to die that way: concealed, hidden below the trenches.  There was no suicide letter nor indication why she did that.  Her family wondered as they wept without tears.  I didn’t.  I knew why.  It was because of me.  And now I am here where she breathed her last.                                           ***  	I met Yoshiko a year ago.  She was sitting on my favorite spot, the largest rock by the sea and her gaze was far away beyond the horizon.  It was midnight then and time seemed to stand still.  The wind was silent and the sea was in utmost tranquility.  I sat beside her and as I looked towards her face, it struck.  A lightning bolt to the heart.  She was the personification of nature’s beauty.  Her skin was as white as snow, and her eyes were as black as the night and as deep as the sea.  Her hair followed her like the waves as she glanced at me.  And then, there it was, that sparkle of comfort, that breeze of peace.  	I asked her why she was there but she kept on looking at me, smiling with her lips of dainty red.  She bowed and began to stand.  I held her hand to stop her.  She went back to her sitting position with her sight again on the horizon, but she never let go of my hand.  And when the wind began to whisper, she moved closer and her head found sleep on my shoulders.  	When she awakened, I noticed that tears flowed from her eyes.  I asked why.  Again, her eyes turned towards mine.  A minute had passed yet her eyes never left mine.  Then, she kissed me tenderly, softly.  With that moment of reverie, I felt heaven.  	The flowers were blooming and their fragrance flooded the air.  The sun’s rays were mellow.  I was in a vast field where harmony seemed endless.  The breeze tickled my nose and my lips were soothed by the warm air.  But my eyes were closed.  	When I woke up, she was already down at the beach.  I ran to meet her, for I forgot to ask for her name.  When, I had already reached her, she smiled and said, “Yoshiko,” without me asking.  She told me to meet her next month at the same spot.  Then she bowed, and continued to walk away.  	And so I did meet her the next month, and the month after that, and so on.  Those days were the happiest days of my life, and were also my saddest.  There were times that all we did was to look at each other, and there were also times when we kissed and held our breath wishing our lips would never part.  But there were times when she cried, when she fell silent and whenever I asked, she would just wipe her tears off and smile.  That smile has a lot of meaning, of concealed emotions, and hidden sadness.  And all I could do was to embrace and kiss her. 	I knew it was impossible for us to be together, always.  She never told me what she feels.  She never even told me her life.  It was all locked up in that smile.  And yet, I risked it.  I risked feeling sadness and loneliness whenever we parted.  I risked the thought that all of this is transient and would go away at some time or another.  I risked all of these, for I knew I would never feel like this or love like this, again.  	It was in the eleventh month when she wanted to say goodbye.  She was going back to Japan.  I asked her not to and said that I love her.  Again, her tears.  	Wiping them off, she said, “In that case I will not go to Japan.  I will stay here where I met you, looked at you, and loved you.”  Then she smiled and walked away as the sun cast its final light.                                            ***  	This day should’ve marked our twelfth month and it should be.  I now shudder in loneliness and in tears. In tears by the sea.  The sun’s light is again fading and I don’t know can stand the darkness.  I have risked everything.  Except one.  And now, I will end transience and begin permanence.  I will see her again.  	Her tears belong to the sea and I will go there to wipe them off.

      A bullet through my head Sacrificed my blood of holy red The peace of the birds awakened As leaves rustle,  saddened  Tears soak the book of grief And the edge of a distant cliff What have I but a gracious fall Through heaven where bells toll  The knife subdued the weak Into Eden of which they seek Through our hearts is a cross Punctured within hope’s loss  The flow of water into the sea Carried Ophelia and the free Naked as we are Of life’s glaring scar  Poison, the liquid of life anew Nostalgic of an evening dew The moon is beholding The Grim Reaper’s appearing  I encroach the wolf’s cry In the desert where vultures fly The sand hears my moan I faint, I am not alone  Below the graveyard lies Zion Where the hunted hunts Orion Through the looking glass is vengeance As I feel the soul’s penance  Long have I passed judgment To the world’s daily lent Now I end life’s nightmare For I have become Icarus’ heir  In death, happiness…

      (haha! first short story ko to! hope you lyk it!)                  I lay there in the sand, my last place of solace, my last place of belonging -  thinking of what might have happened between the two of us if I have only stayed in the city.  But, fate dictated our lives and though it is true love’s fibers that fabricates our two souls together, the circumstances are against us.  The sea in front of me appears unreachable, an immense element that can never be grasped.  The crimson sky encompasses the horizon with much melancholy that all substance of happiness has flown out of my body.  The breeze is not comforting at all as I welcome with wholeness, the feeling I dreaded most – loneliness.  	I was a freshman in the State University when I first met her.  I was studying under a tree when she suddenly appeared in front of me and asked if I could help her in her term paper on Crisanto Evangelista.  We were both famous back then.  In my case, I was the freshman walking encyclopedia who ventures mostly on the revolutionary struggle of the Filipinos.  She, on the other hand, was famous for her intoxicating beauty and glaring riches.  She was the daughter of a crony capitalist but at the same time, the dream in the eyes of the proletarian students, for everyday, her beauty immediately vibrates throughout the campus as she walks out of the limousine.  I couldn’t believe it back then that she was talking to me.  She, the embodiment of a goddess, was in front of me – a street rat with only a peso in his pocket.  Of course, I gladly agreed with my heart throbbing with joy.   She smiled and took my hand.  She led me to her limo and for the first time, I was indulged in the cold profligacy of the rich and warm comfort of her presence.  	She held my hand with intimacy and sidled with me.  The closeness was alluring, a poisonous honey to which I want to succumb.  She told me she was an avid fan of my writing.  I merely nodded.  She kept asking about my personal life and all I answered was silence.  I couldn’t tell her that I belonged to the lower class, though I think she already knew because of the clothes I had been wearing.  She looked at me with her clear eyes that reflect eternity and questioned why my mouth was shut tight.  Silence.  All I could do was inhale her breath with deep reverie.  She leaned on my shoulders and her eyes closed.  I looked out the window to see the sun’s effulgence fading beyond the Manila Bay.  	The limo came to a halt.  My eyes glistened, for the vehicle stopped in front of Manila Hotel.  She woke up and told me that she would treat me for dinner.  I would like to refuse then but somehow, minutes later, I found myself inside the hotel.  When I had been presented with the menu, my eyes and mouth widened.  I was speechless in disbelief.  The names of the delicacies were not in my vocabulary and the prices were over the roof and probably even over the sky.  She laughed as she witnessed my split-second trance.  To free me from shame, she was the one who ordered.  	A sparkle of delight, or shall I say, love entered in my eyes when I saw her manner of eating.  She put the spoon between her two lips ever so gently, ever so tenderly.  After eating, her eyes gazed at mine.  The thread of love bonded them.  I shook my head with eyes closed, as if waking from a daydream.  Bowed, I said that her term paper would be finished the next day.  I left, walking back to my plain reality.  	On the next day, true to my words, I gave her the term paper.  She thanked me with her cherubic smile.  I thought that was the end of my relations with but as I was about to leave, she asked if we could go out together.  I nodded, treading softly to a dream that could never be.  	The days that followed were pervaded with an ethereal coexistence between the two nuclei of our felicitous emotions.  There were strolls in the park, lolls in the beach, lullabies in the halls to lull our eyes that have been jaded of looking at each other.  The great disparity that alienates our two class seemed just an oblivious matter.  I guessed that was what the philosophical imbalance called love could do.  But, I was wrong.  Reality will always be reality.  	It was dusk and great somber crept through the shores.  It was time to separate the supposedly inseparable bind of God for us.  Her tears flowed down her clear pallid face.  She still looked angelic even if she was crying.  Her embrace encroached my presence and I surrendered to her caress.  But, we both knew this is not our fate.  The indictment of society towards our togetherness obliterated even the whole essence of love itself.  I had my own principles and she had hers.  She lived in a mansion, and I would be in the mountains.  She is rich and I, poor.  What a castrating cliché! But, for the balance, yin-yang, to progress, we, the polars of our world, should stay apart.  But was not love, faith and hope created to unbalance the equilibrium of this science-bound world?   	Our lips met. Her breath was life, immortality even.  I succumbed at last to her wish and our oneness was complete but the dream was over.  The mountains awaited me.  	The waves seem to be closing in on my wounded body.  Do these mighty waves see my past, my life, my future?  The sun seemed to moved farther away.  I looked up but I saw a cloudless sky with no birds.  My eyesight is failing but I know that it is already dusk again.  I walk towards the sea.  I can reach it.  I must reach it.  The waves are rising.  I raised my two bloodied arms and shouted to the heavens her name.  Then, darkness.

      Wicked as the light of the day Is your stench of Deception.  Look at me, Distraught with malice About to wake from the Dream.  The bitterness appears And I, wail, weep in Pain, for you took away Truth.  Let the crows hear my plea Let the vultures devour Your waking hours And leave you in the night, Clothed with naked truth Thus, I give you A Love.  Let’s tread in the Nightmares life showers So that only I Comfort you With my vengeance, My proof of Life, Love.

      A solitary star was glistening in the dark sky and below it, the wind was swaying the leaves of numerous trees.  Flowers, although devoid of their daily hues, were still offering their amorous perfume, and while birds were in distant slumber, crickets were providing the symphony of the night… 	 	They were the only ones who were witnessing that night’s wonder and Mina thought it was best that way.  They were holding each other’s hands, looking at each other’s eyes, feeling each other’s warmth.  And the whole place was engulfed in silence.  Mina wanted to say something but the beating of his heart enthralled her. So time passed through them, without any sound disturbing their togetherness.  	Until he uttered so softly, “Mina, promise me one thing: never open your eyes…”  	But she did.  She had to.  It was another dream and the sun had already taken its place in the sky.  When light fully entered her eyes, she closed them quickly.  The light seemed foreign to her.  She has not been used to it ever since he left.  She got up from her bed with her eyes half-opened; walked towards the windows, and closed the blinds.  She welcomed the slight darkness.  She went back to her bed and laid there, not knowing what to do next.  	She thought of the dream.  It was different from the others she had in the past.  It was more vivid, more lucid.  She really felt his hands, his warmth and his heartbeat.  She could still hear the crickets, and the fragrance still caresses her nose.  It appears to have happened just minutes ago. And his voice, his plea; it still echoes in her ears.  She began to cry.  ********************************  	It was dusk and they were both lying on the grass, looking at the sky’s fading and morose light.  There were no clouds, no birds, no wind.  Mina was smiling, for they were together.  But, his countenance was filled with uncertainty.  She wondered why.  	Suddenly he stood and said, “Mina, I have to go.” 	Startled, she replied,” Why? It’s still early.” 	He helped her stand up, looked at her and uttered, “I really have to go.” 	“Oh, sure.  I’ll call you, ok?” 	“Don’t” 	“Huh, why?” 	“Because I have to go.” 	 And she understood.  It was over.  She lowered as the wind finally announced its presence. Leaves began to rustle.  She wouldn’t cry.  She never cried in front of him.  	Then she heard again his voice.  This time it seemed far away, though he is still near.  “I loved you, Mina.  God knows how much I loved you.  But, it’s all over now.  I wanted to tell you sooner but I didn’t have the courage.  I have fallen out of love, Mina.  I’m sorry.  I hope you understand.  Please understand.” 	 	“I understand.”  That was all she could say.  	“Thank you.  Please move on.  I wish you luck.  I wish you happiness.  Listen, I’m just not the right man for you, ok?  You’ll find him soon.”  	“I know.”  	He looked up.  He seemed to be thinking of the right words to say. And finally, he said solemnly, “Mina, have a final glimpse of light.  Night is coming.”  With that said, he walked away just as leaves and tears began to fall.  ***************************************  	She went to her drawer and found it.  Her face was still drenched with tears.  She walked again towards the windows, but this time very slowly.  She stood there for a long time, gazing at nothing, but thinking of him.  He was her life; her breath, her sight, her music, her purpose.  	When her tears had dried off, she opened the blinds and whispered, “My final glimpse of light.”  	Her eyes closed, never to open again.

      I held your hand And I fell Without grace  I love you till forever fades Into the twilight.  And night. The sun is just rising And dawn is far from approaching  Yet you let go And I fell again Without life  The sands fly around us and they enter my eyes I am blinded Only seeing the hand that was  Echo. The sound of every footstep. Vibrating.  Fading.  But how come? I am deaf  I shouted, but no wind To carry my voice And I am mute  Goodbye? No, useless... Night.

       Hampered hopes on the swinging light  Floating above the precipice and below it,  Falling behind the dampened love  &nbsp;  Sweet despair, sweet and tender  Swaying with the clouds, far and yonder  Fragrant vengeance, fragrant and amorous  Praying in the fire, alongside Prometheus  &nbsp;  Soaring down to Hades, a lonely  Gone is she, the innocence of Persephone  Burning within the requiem  Is a dangling priest, angry at the loss  &nbsp;  Mercy for the souls of the  Weak.&nbsp; For theirs is the kingdom  Where Cerberus lives  Undying and Suffering.

       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ever since Ma’am elucidated the canons of writing, I have been losing faith in my words, and in my life.&nbsp; Everything that I have written seems to be a worthless tautology that does not deserve a place in any paper.&nbsp; All of it is meaningless, useless, futile; for all of it does not really convey what I want want to express.&nbsp; It appears I am only seeking to impress.&nbsp; It is all an act of obstentation.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried following Ma’am’s teachings, but the results were as destructive as my previous writings, probavly even more.&nbsp; They were trash.&nbsp; Thus, I found myself in doubt and uncertainty, not knowing what and how to write.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Am I merely a barbarian who does not know how to write a decent material (specifically a precis)?&nbsp; Why have I not the ability to express myself in a simple but beautiful way?&nbsp; What is wrong with me?&nbsp; Am I even a writer?   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By doubting my writing abilities, I have doubted myself, my purpose.&nbsp; For a long time now, I have considered the pen as my primary instrument to serve God and to fulfill the purpose He has assigned to me.&nbsp; The paper has served as my sanctum whenever everyone was at a distant place I could not reach.&nbsp; Words have comforted me, reminding everytime that I am someone.&nbsp; But now, with all that Ma’am said, I have no knowledge and wisdom to know and understand my purpose. &nbsp;I have lost my singlemost refuge.&nbsp; And I have become no one.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am grounded.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Humbled.

              It is with my most sullen remorse that I write to you now, for this has long been delayed and in order to write this with truth, I still have to delve the deepest remnants of our past.  I just hope my words may still find refuge in your heart.  	Our past.  ‘Tis the sweetest and most amorous blend of harmony between two hearts whose beats form the perfect music of a world only seen above the sky.  ‘Tis a gift that gave me a peace that is absent from my being.  ‘Tis the time I felt life, heaven, you.  And I cherished it with all the vitality I have left.  It gave me the strength to withstand the raging tides, the hope to see something fruitful in the days to come.  And ironically, our past gave me a future to hold on, to dream on.  It gave me all of these because it is the only entity in my life where I can find your love.  	Time does not heal wounds; it worsens them.  And I have my heart to prove it.  Many times, I tried to find someone to suffice my longing for your return, and many times, I thought I succeeded.  But every time I found one, the scars of the past kept going back, and every time that happens, the pain deepens.  It has become so deep that only my wounded but hoping heart could sustain my soul’s existence.  	Betrayal.  I have betrayed myself, my love and you, by trying to replace a love so pure and so true to another love that has yet to define its essence.  I’m sorry.  	I deserve my loneliness.
