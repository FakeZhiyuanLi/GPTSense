         Last week I was Up North. We have a simmer house up in Pentwater. It is right by Ludington. Our family has a very long line up in Pentwater. My grandparents were raised there.&nbsp; Anyways, we have alot of people that now me and our family. My grandpa always tells me I have 50 grandparents there. It is great. There is one family though that really stands out. The pearles's. I dont know if you know them or not. The father and grandpa were both coaches for Michigan State football. Weel, The pearles"s have a son named Micheal. He is my age and he is really nice. Not that cute though. They also have a daughter and an older son. Their family is very close friends with onother family, The Bloohm's. They also have 3 kids. They have 3 sons. One of the sons is my age. He is also very cute. If you get the picture. He is always out on boats or in the sun so he is very tan. A hottie.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That day they asked if we wanted to go tubing. Me and my mom and litle sister decided to go. It was so fun. The best part was spending time on the tube with alex. We went all by our selves, just me and him. It was the best tubing experience ever. I am so exighted to go back up to Pentwater. We are going up in a couple of weeks for the homecoming up there. Alex told us to come back and go tubing with them again. It is going to be twice as fun. Their boat goes really fast and Mrs. Pearles drives the boat crazy so we go flying everywhere on the tube. Alex and I even flew off a couple times. So super fun. One thing I really like about him is his personality. He is really funny. He even tried to go fishing with a net on the beach. I knew that was not going to happen.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to boyz and my grandma. There is nothing in commen. With her, you cant even mension boyz without her thinking something bad about you. My mom even told me about how she couldnt even dress cute without my grandma thinging she was kissing boyz and stuff. If you know whaat I mean. I guess you could say im a little boy crazy but in a grood way. Why not have a little fun with boyz. They are just }awesome!

        I am a very social person. It really doesnt matter who i socialize with as long as I am socializing. For all of the years that i have ever been in school, all of my teachers have mentioned how talkative I am. It doesnt really bother me that much, but my parents really have some what of a prblem with it. I have traveled from friends to friends. It not like i cling to people or anything, its just that i like to hang out with all sorts of people. Just this year i have gone through alot with friends. I started out with a best friend that i had been with for 4 years. We always were together. LIteraly. All of a sudden, she started being so mean. Now, i know it wasnt puberty, there was just something that was bugging her about me. Personaly, i think she was jealious of me. I do have a pretty goiod life. She called me some racial slurs. My dad is black and my mom is white. Not a big deal for me. Ever since all of that happened, we have never spoken again. After all of that happened, I started hanging out with another group. To me they all seemed really nice for a while. But after a while I started seeing what kind of people they really were. I noticed the behavier of bullies or druggies. I knew that some of them had smoked but i didnt really think about it. I had never done anything like that in my life and i was not about to start. After their big turn over, i decided it was time for a better scene. So I went on a "search" for some new friends. My old friends still talk to me and everything, but it&nbsp;isnt the same. I finally found the people i belonged with. These girls that i met had a good reputation and everything. They were really funny and so nice. We totaly hit it off.&nbsp;We have been friends ever since. They are so awesome.&nbsp; I have also met alot of people in cheerleading. That is another advantage to the sport. My life friend wise is so awesome right now. I think i have it pretty good.

         Todays lesson i learned is that cheerleading totaly can take up alot of your schedule. I have practice 2 times a week and that takes up alot of time as it is. Then you have to&nbsp;add on all of the extra tumbling (gymnastics practices). Our coach has us go 2 times a week for&nbsp;2 hours in total. Every night after a practice, my body is so sore. Today&nbsp;I had tumbling. I am already tired. Cheerleading can also get tangled up with friends and vacation. I have been&nbsp;wanting to do something with one&nbsp;of my&nbsp;friends almost the whole summer. Cheerleading got in the way.&nbsp;Our coach only lets us miss 3 practices. That is trouble when you want to go on vacation. So if you think you are ready to start cheerleading, maybe you&nbsp;should check your schedule. One of the secrets to being a succesful cheerleader is being&nbsp;willing to give up things you like to do something you love. &nbsp;
