      geography was a sucess.   the science room "kitchen" is from the 50's.  it HAS to be.  besides teh fact that the nobes are switched and it wouldn't pre-heat.. we still managed to look like idiots.  then after like 45 minutes, we finally got the noodles to cook, after numerous taste tests (haha) so in the end we cooked: two pizza's, pasta and jalopa.. we better get a good mark.   JAYS BACK!!!!!!!!!    so today is saturday.  emma and i went shoppping for michelle.  i got a shirt.  then we got tortellini. and i want a green bathingsuit.. BADLY.  we then went to p.p.m (don't we sound cool!?) but that's a secret, just incase michelle reads this.  tonight is michelle's party.. some people are going to zach's though..   but whatever.. were gone to make pizza ON TORTILLA SHELLS.   yum.   the always interesting, megan.. accompained by miss emma.

      well well well.. if it isn't tuesday.  my little brother, jay left for camp today.. camp wahoway? or something like that.. well yes, he's gone.  i'm sad.. i miss him.  the best thing about today was realizing how hot veins (BIG VEINS) are.  next time, look at a guys arm.. and i guarantee if he has big veins.. yeah- it'll be HOT. = LIKE TYLER!!  his veins are godsent.  definetly.  THE MAIN TOPIC OF THIS BLOG.. IS DEEM'S AND MY HIGHLY ANTICIPATED FIRST SOCCER GAME OF THE SEASON. way to ruin is florohghgklhjlgh.  so.. we get to the feild. then these hotshots show up.. pfft. they think there all that. BUT they ain't. na-ah. so we start the game.. PS- I WAS CAPTAIN!!!!!!!!!!! anyways, we started off (and i hear from some girls that this team is rough)like that's just gay.  why we rough, when you can be nice!? okay, so then they start beating on us.  the average height on our team is like 5'4, where as on their team, it's like 7'9!! (so maybe im exagerating.. a little, but like they were tall and muscular.. so ill say they were all like 5'7..around there. but yeah, they thought it would be fun to like kill SARAH.  deem did not like that.  what a rough girl, but i love her.  THIS REALLY MEAN GIRL PUSHED CAITLIN INTO A PUDDLE.. then laughed. then said it was priceless, it was so mean.  i cried.. on the inside.  but caitlin took it pro, like alot of things.  yeah, i like how i got a shot on the net.. SLASH NOT!! i didn't get one freaking shot, not one!  sheeeesh.  well i got a breakaway, but #5 insisted on poping my elbow out of it's socket, and stepping on my toes.. thanks loser.  so we lost 5-0.  PLEASE, (for my confidence)..dont laugh.   MY DAD'S "4RUNNER" BROKE DOWN TODAY!! bahahhaha.  BECCA, RYAN, BARTY, DAVID, KATIE.. and all them are leaving for montreal today = have a blast babes :)  ..that's all for now really.  i hope you enjoyed my endless complaining!!  the always interesting, megan.

      ps, i'm sorry my blog's suck.  so kelsi and i have no friends.. except each other. aha, honestly.  we did nothing "productive" this weekend, as my popsey says.. by the way is it disrespectful to call my dad popsey?.. cause that's what caroline said.  ANYWAYS.  so kelsi and i (AND JORJA) walked to video king.  the considerate person i am, i stayed outside with kelsi's dog..and i thought kels would ASK me if the movie she picked out was okay, but NOPE she never did that.. she just.. proceeded to rent the movie without my concent, but whatever, it was all smiles.  then, like always we went to subway (aww yeah) this time, no man with a pullet in his head. who would have thought?  then we got to my house.. where it started to TERENTIAL RAIN!! wtf, why so much rain in ontario.. like honestly?  anywayyyyyys. kelsi INSISTED we dance in the rain, it's so over rated.  when ever it rains, you think.. "hm, why NOT dance in the rain" ..see what movies do to us?! i shivered, kelsey didn't "birdy, birdy, birdy" that's what everyone at her cottage screams when she jumps off rocks.. yeah, i don't even get that one either.  the highlight my night you ask? definetly JONAS PHILLIP WHITE not calling us "fuckfaces" thanks bud! OMG THOUGH!! that was definetly the freakiest night of my life.  kelsi, in the middle of the night (halfasleep.. or totally awake) woke me up, to her in my face saying all the most random things. kels: "leave the hosue. do what your told.. the cheese!" meg: "kelsey.. what the hell are you talking about?" kels: "dont you understnad!?" meg: "no.. your definetly scaring me" .. then she falls to her pillow sleeping.  also, kelsey likes to roam around my house, insisting on popping popcorn, and eating it for breakfast.. yeah i know!?  hahaha.. well yeah that was our days.  the always interesting megan.

BUT WE CHASED IT. with cranberry juice MMMMMMM!  but yeah hahhaahahah.  don't worry all you L-C'ers. i did not get drunk (unlike kelsi,what an alchey) but we did look like ass' the whole night = my boyfriend worrying, and pissing this guy off. AKACHUUUUUUUUUUUU.  yeah, hmm.. what else, too much stuff.. last night was definetly my first introduction to "the bottle" but all in good fun my dears.  i also remember waking up,and being afraid cause kels was asleep hahah and i also lost my sock in my sleep NOOOOO. i woke up to the sound of a printer printing off a bajillion pages. and kels "TYLERS ON" wow. thanks baby "i thought you were a litte baby smarty insy winsy cookie.. but i guess your a motherly apple pie".. suit yourself.  plus, kelsi has a weird family.. where all they have in thier house is like a bajillion bags of natcho mini bites .. or somethign like that.. so..

"bonjour"-darcy *french girl doesn't respond* "..bitch"-darcy "bonjour"-darcy *french man doesn't respond* "asshole.."-darcy  "bonjour fence, bonjour garden, bonjour chair, bonjour grass"-darcy "oh, so your not going to answer me too?

"dont you just want to strangle him sometimes?"-kels  so then we toured some mre, adn went back to the hotel.. where i had a huuuuuuuuuuuuge spaz..  "do you know where bus 1+2 are?"-me "..yeah i think they already left"-mr.walker. *i go back into my room, angry* "bus 1 and 2 already left."-me *lindsay and i freak out* *i go by the window* "i cant belive they left"-me *suddenly i get super pissed and throw mny brush as hard as i cna at the wall, it then ricoshades off the wall and hit randi.. hard* "HOLY SHITTTTTTTTT, megan that hurt"-randi.. "sorry.."-me "OMG BUS 1 .. THERE HERE!!!!"-devi.    then we left for the spaghetti place..  "theres no sauce on mine"-devi "it's real italian ceaser dressing"-me "theres no sauce though"-devi "thats because it's authentic real italian ceaser"-me "but look theres no sauce"-devi "i give up!"-me  that night, horrible. so much shit flying around, and most of it ended up being fake, i say that was like the biggest thing in quebec that happened, for me. and it was sad.  i like how everyone crowded into the girlsroom though..  *you+you=love*-darcy, showing peter through glass "what?" "YOU+YOU=LOVE"-darcy "oh.. yeah, okay?"-peter.  "frig, i got sauce on my jeans, and before the boat"-connor angry "aw, now you can't be pimpin', too bad"-emma. I LOVE YOU.  "DUDE. he is soooo going to break up with you!!!!!"-jeremy, thanks bud!  so then we walked around for a bit, where it got even more confusing.

      greg, i think.. you need time to cool off man.  kay, so today was round one of the ontario cup.  thanks for telling us we were playing against ELITE teams there greg! appreciate it.  i like how i was wearing a knee brace today, how PRO did i look? demi's only jealous cause "she doesn't have a knee brace, so she doesn't look like a good enough player that gets hurt.. cause there sooo good."  we went to harvey's for lunch, after our first lose.  then we came back and demi told me this hilariouse story.. it goes like this:  demi and jacquie were at dem's and they were on msn, they clicked on abid's name, and there was a phone icon.  they didn't know what it meant, so they proceeded in sending messages like "what the fuck", "bjhbdgsdglhjtuy" and "this is gay.. what the hell, bye." then a couple days later, demi was like "ABID WTF WAS WITH THAT CELLPHONE THING" and he was like "OMG!!!!!!!!! THAT WAS YOU!!.. i was in a tense moment with my family, and it started going off and making these soudns (demi can only make then haha) and then i couldn't get it to stop, and it was so tense.. and MY AUNT! and it was buzzing and ringing, and i got all these messages, i couldn't understand it.." "yeah, it was definetly jac."   (ps, while im writing this, im hysterically laughing, props dem)  ew.. worst soccer pitch EVER. and considering it cost over a millino dollars to create.  firstly, it backs onto the 401, so you get all this dirty shit air, and you can feel the gross heat coming from the exhaust. and jesus, like they CANT afford grass, they had artificial turf, fucking idiots = THEY PUT TAR IN THE TURF.  grossest thing ever, it would get hot, and smell like ass.. and like we boiling hot.  it was the worstest experience ever.   im not telling the scores = too high for my liking.  we play again tomorrow.. my prediction: megan will have a sudden outburst of sunstroke, and mysteriously won't be able to play the pathedic game!!  "GO FATTY!!!! GOOOOOOO" - demi (directed to me)  the always interesting, megan.

      first i'll start out with soccer..  branford, your terrible.  sorry, but we won, 3-0 :)  props to katja and sarah for scoring.  g'job girls. ps, i ALSO scored!!  and it was a left footer, AND it was in front of the whole u14a guys team, yeah connor what was that? PRO, "wut wut" yeah pro.  so today, was indeed the track meet..  yeah it sucked. FOR ME ATLEAST.  okay, so hurdles is the first event, and i got to finals.. all is good.  then this girl decides to PUSH me when im jumping over the hurdle, leading to me falling/WHIPING OUT in front of like about 200-300 people. oh godddd.. so then like that wasn't bad ENOUGH, i had to go infront and them call me for 6th place. = last place (in the finals atleast) then my knee really hurt, and i coudln't do 200m, but i had to or else i would go back to school..so i did, and what did i get? oh yeah 6th again.  so for the rest of the time, i sat on the bleachers with people.  baha, i got demi goooood.  you know i did demi..  YEAH and apparently i look like bambie? .. and bambie's a boy, so wtf? hahhaa  anyways, my knee is pissing me off, and i have the ontario cup this weekend, frigging gay trackkk  aaah,  AND TYLER, it will stay bad, adn get infected adn be hurting for the rest of my lifeeeeeeee.
