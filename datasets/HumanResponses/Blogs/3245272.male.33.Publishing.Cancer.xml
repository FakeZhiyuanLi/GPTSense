      That's it. I've had enough! Two-hour commutes down 880 in the East Bay get me horny as a dog. All of those truckers. All of those unsatisfied married men. I'm out of town this weekend, looking for dick in all the right places. If I'm lucky, I'll let you know, in grand, explicit detail. Friday night, after work, I'm on the road. I'll be back by Monday sometime...I hope. :) Never know what (or who) I'll end up doing. I can't wait. Fuck yeah!

      Work, work, work, house-hunting, grocery shopping, laundry...doing I guess, work, work, work. I just don't have time for cock this week! And today is no exception. It's a gorgeous day as seen from my windows, but I can't go out and play. I simply  have  to make more time for sexual pursuits! I must try. Perhaps I'll go all out again next weekend and sow some more oats.  Sorry I couldn't be more fulfilling.

      I was just as horny this past Saturday as I was last Saturday, so I jumped in the car and drove back to that little spot in Kingsburg. As I've learned in other things, sometimes too much of a good thing isn't a good thing, and I think I'll take a break and not make the third time the charm. It was fun. I had some good cock, but let's not become a regular, K?  So I get there around 9 p.m. There were fewer cars and trucks than there were last weekend. I thought my first trick was going to be a trucker, but it turned out that he liked young latinos, not 30-something white guys. So we just talked for a few minutes. He was amped up on some allergy medicine and didn't want to drive or sleep with the stuff. "Why waste good energy?" Trucker drove for Knight and said it was a good company. I've thought about driving OTR for a while now and have had a problem when it comes to picking a company to drive for. Fuck, I have to pass the CDL first!! Anyway, this guy likes Knight, has driven for 20 years, and said it's a good company.  The real first trick was two hours later, in an RV. Trucker mentioned that RV was out looking around, but 'cause Trucker likes 'em young and hispanic, RV didn't cut it. RV was a former Marine turned Daddy who gave me his really nice, thick cock and forced it down my throat. Normally I don't go in for the role playing, the scenes, the whole "talk to me dirty" crap. Save it for the stage, dude. Just give me your load so I can git. But there was something about this guy when he said, "yeah, you gonna make Daddy happy?" that made me feel OK and made me want to assume the role. Maybe it was the inner child in me (fear of that), but it just felt good to have his dick in my mouth at that moment. So I kept it up, and shortly thereafeter, with my head resting on his thigh, his hand brushing my hair, he came a huge load and shot part of it clear to my throat. It was awesome. We talked for a few minutes afterwards, and he told me of a couple of other spots along I-5 that I hadn't been to before, and then I was off to find more cock.  The moment I stepped out of his RV, with my hard cock bouncing in my gym shorts, there were three other guys trying to sit me down. One of them got me, the other two got each other. The second trick was another married guy in a big pickup. He invited me in, dropped his shorts, and fed me a load. He was a nice guy, heavy smoker, though, didn't stop smoking the whole time I was going down on him. One after another. I was afraid he'd drop his ash on my head or neck while I was sucking him off. That would  not  have been cool, needless to say. He was eager to get off again and asked me to stick around for a few minutes while he built up another one. I didn't have anywhere else to go, so I hung out, playing with myself, watching the parade of cars pass by. Fifteen minutes or so later, he pulls himself a hard-on and asks me to suck him off again. "Why ask? I'm mean, that's why I stayed," I said to him. Yummy, yummy, in my tummy.  The night was pretty slow after that. When I was talking to Trucker and RV, they both said that Saturday night was dead compared to Friday nights. That's one reason why I probably won't come back here for a while. I was thinking that if Friday night really was a better, more busy night to come by, I could leave right after work on Friday afternoon, like right at five, drive down here, get here by 10-ish, and then spend Friday night sucking cock. I could return home by noon-ish on Saturday and have my whole weekend before me with no interruption on Saturday night. Plus it gives me time to go out to my other haunts that I've neglected because of this extravagence. (I have a tendency to over-plan.) And it really is an extravagence, too. It's almost six hundred miles round-trip, and while gas is really expensive now (or at least Americans think it's expensive here), it only cost about two tanks of gas, about $50 bucks, total. So that's not really that bad.   There was one other guy that I met before I left. He was another white guy, Southern, very polite, and very eager to get off. He approached my car and saw me fooling around with myself, and asked if I would suck him off. Well, he asked what I liked to do, and when I told him definitively that I suck cock, he said, "oh good! That's what I need right now." So I followed him out of the lot and across the highway to a campground. It was busy that night, there was a tavern full of people, loud music, drunk fools spilling out everywhere, so it was easy to blend in. We parked near the back of the lot and walked over by the lake. It was dark and very quiet where we ended up. This guy was so eager to get off, I felt like it was a setup for a few minutes. Even when he took out his nicely scuplted cock and even after my mouth was full of it, he kept asking me questions like "when was your first time?" "Mmmph, 15, mmmm." "Were you forced?" I stopped, pulled his dick out of my mouth, looked at him in the face, and said, "no. No one ever forced me to suck cock. The guy was hot. He took off his pants, I went down on him, ate his cum, and we became friends." "Wow, that's hot." I went back to work, finished his briny spunk down with a swig of Sprite that I had with me, and that was that. Before we left, I asked him if he considered himself straight. "Oh yeah. I love to fuck pussy, but I've never met a chick who can suck dick as good as a gay guy can." "Well, we have dicks, we know what it's supposed to feel like, and most of us enjoy it and the cum you shoot, so why shouldn't we be good at it?" "Yep." Honestly, if I lived closer, I would have let this guy call me up just for the blowjob. He was pretty cool, and I'm sure with a little time, I could loosen him up enough to take his pants down past his knees so I could massage his balls with my tongue as well. He looked like he could have used that.  One final note before I leave the truck stop:  If you're cruising someone in their car, don't automatically assume that they're interested in getting it on with you just because they look at you. And  don't  try to get in their car unless you've been invited. This little faggot (and I'll use that word sparingly here, and only for emphasis when the details merit) passes my car, stares me down, and parks right behind me. I watch him walk up to the passenger door and pull on my locked door handle to get in. He bends down to meet my stern gaze, and I shake my head no, you rude person. He walks over to my open window and says "let me in." Not "please," not, "may I," but "let me in." I'm all. Uh uh. No. I'm not interested. He tried that on one other car in the lot and drove off squealing his little Honda tires in a huff. It's called manners, you punk-ass pansy.  At about 4:30 a.m., I took off and left the stop. I got to thinking about the other places that RV and Trucker told me about, and I wanted to check them out before I had to get home on Sunday afternoon. I did make plans for the afternoon, and I felt like I was on a tight schedule. So I drove up I-5 back to a vista point north of Santa Nella. There are a couple of vista points along I-5, and two of them are very cruisy indeed. The first one is on the southbound side up, high up on a hill. When I got there at 6:30, there were two cars and a big rig. One of the cars had a vanity plate that indicated that he was into bears, and I knew that I could score with this guy. He wasn't visible in the car, so I figured he was lying down asleep. The other car was a guy who looked really familiar to me, like either from school or from San Francisco. He cruised me for a few minutes, I showed my erect cock, he smiled, and then he left. OK, whatever.   A little later, the trucker emerged from his cab and saunted up the hill in my direction. At first, I couldn't tell that he was interested so I put my dick away, but as he approached, I could tell what he wanted. He tried small talk at first, "you a Mac user? You like Apples? What's the difference between that and the other kind?" Obvious small talk to get the conversation headed in his direction. He looked into my car, "nice leather seats," and saw my pent up erection, "you look a little restricted there." I pulled out my dick, he reached in and stroked it a few times, "you know, my truck has curtains." And on we went down to his cab. This guy had a nice cock and balls, but one thing he did was dust them, heavily, with baby powder. After he laid down on his bunk, he smiled at me and I gingerly brushed some of the powder off. He laughed and said, "you're not the first person who's done that." Ha ha. I'll bet. It was over before I knew it, and I was in my car and on the road again. This is what you get when you're desperate to break your own records!  Heading north again, there was another vista point that I hadn't ever paid attention to before that morning. I pulled off and drove up the hill to the lot. There were a couple of cars and a rig. One guy was out prancing around in his tight jean shorts which revealed his fairly long cock trailing down his leg. He walked by my car a couple of times emphasizing his crotch as if that were going to make me more horny than I already was. So, I invited him into my car. He got in and immediately took off his pants. He said, in a slurry almost drunk accent, "Doan suck me. I want hand job only." Hand job? Uh, well, being as I aim to please, I gave him his hand job, but only grudgingly so. He thanked me and left. I didn't realize that I was being watched by the other car and the rig while I was jacking this guy off. The trucker in the rig rolls down his window and yells "thank you! Now he'll leave us alone!" As I said, this is what desperation gets you. The trucker was cute, but nothing happened there. I left shortly afterwards.  These two stops have great potential, but I don't think Sunday morning was the best time to be there. They're also much closer to home, so perhaps these are viable options to driving to Kingsburg.  There was one other place I had to try before I went home. This was a reservoir out by Tracy, off of Grant Line Road. Grant Line is back in the country, and there is one little spot that is mildly cruisy if the cops aren't around. But this reservoir is so far out in the country, it's a perfect place to cruise. When I got there, the place was empty, but I could see it has enormous potential. So, we'll have to check this out sometime, perhaps later at night. Hey, I could swing through Altamont Pass (if there are no cops), down through Grant Line to the reservoir, and then out to 5 south and then back up 5 north! Maybe next weekend! (What did I say about planning? And it's only Monday.) It is a good spot, though. It's far out which might not be easy for some people, but it's quiet, and it's easy enough to see traffic to stop what you're doing in time. Details, darling, details. We'll see. I'll write about it, I'm sure.  It's Monday now, and I'm writing this at work with a hard-on bulging beneath my chinos, so let me wrap this up quick. See ya! If anyone who reads this has comments or suggestions, please let me know! I'm always eager to find new things! You can leave a comment here or send an  urlLink e-mail . Would love to hear from you.

      On the way home from work last night, I took another trip out to Aquatic Park in Berkeley. I was too horny to pass this up, and since it's not exactly out of my way, why the hell not? When I got there, the sun was just setting over the Golden Gate. Mt. Tam was in silhouette, the horizon was a brilliant orange, the sky above it a slow gradient to a deep blue. Add the roar of traffic from I-80 and you've a great scene. Anyway, I'm walking along the path when I come across a guy I saw on Sunday afternoon. We'll call him Queenie Little Bitch One (QLB1), and for good reason. He smiled at me, I smiled back. I said, "didn't I see you here on Sunday?" He replied affirmatively, saying that he was here, Sunday and last night, with his friend who we'll call Queenie Little Bitch Two (QLB2). QLB1 asked if I remembered the guy in the SUV who I sucked off, the  S&P  bear who was parked right next to me. I'm not one to kiss and tell (really, I'm not), but I wanted to know where this was going so I said, "sure, how could I forget?" "I saw him later on," he said, "and he was really impressed with your cocksucking skills." "Oh? That's nice of him to say." "Would you care to take a walk?" I gave him the once over, shrugged, and said, "sure."  We ended up in the bushes again, he dropped trou, I dropped to my knees. I did my stuff, he shot his stuff, and that was it. It was a total release. There was nothing more to it than two horny men getting off. I don't even know if there was a mutual attraction. Well, at the time I didn't know if there was, but now I know there definitely  wasn't . So we pack up and head out of the bushes to find his friend, QLB2 waiting off to the side. He started laughing and said, "girl! You did  not  go in there with  him ." "Shut up, fool." "Yeah, what did that other guy say to you?" OK, what the fuck? People are, like, talking shit about me? No way! "What did the other guy say?" I asked. QLB2 replied, "he said that you were fat but like all fat people you sucked good cock, so it was worth it." My mouth dropped open, but not in the good way. "Oh, really? So he could put up with being disgusted long enough for me to swallow his load? How chivalrous of him." QLB1 started to say something, and I cut him off and said, "OK, well, gotta go. You queens have fun!" And I took off.  Let's be honest here. I'm not a gym queen. If I were, I'd spend more time cruising the showers and the steam room than working on the weights for the whole gym experience to be effective anyway. And while I'm clinically obese because of my BFI, I'm not horribly fat and ugly. I am tall enough and blessed with a solid bone structure to be able to carry it well. I wear sensible clothing, and I know I'm overweight. I've never heard something like this before and I'd be lying to say that it didn't hurt. I know, I know, who cares what a couple of tweaked out, anorexic queens think? I'm good at what I do, and I don't go cruising to make long-time friends. I go out to suck dick. That's all there is to it. So I guess I can let them talk as much as they want. As long as they get their dick out.

      One of my favorite places to cruise in the Bay Area (BA) is the river at Niles Canyon in the East Bay. The trails alone are worth the drive. Every year after the rainy season, the trails are "re-created" in a slightly different pattern than the year before, so it's always an adventure for me, discovering new nooks and crannies that may have been carved out by an overflowing river.  Upon my return to the Bay Area from my road trip, I was still horny, so I decided to hit the trails. By the time I got there, it was 12&nbsp;p.m. and really hot out, something like 95&deg;F. And by this time of the day, the place was already overrun by families, so much so that the parking lot had two rows of trucks, cars, and mini-vans. At first glance, I thought it was a bad idea. I parked anyway and hit the trails looking for dick. Usually on the weekends, there are plenty of guys around, but apparently the families scared them all away, as perhaps they should have me as well if I hadn't been so cock-craving horny. As it was, I only found and did one guy, a completely sexy latino with a beautiful uncut cock who I had serviced during a previous visit. He led me into the dense shrubs and pulled his shorts down. (I'm really hoping there was no poison oak in all the greenery. I didn't see any, and as of yet, I haven't started itching, so I think it's OK!) I immediately assumed the position and got to work. Right before he exploded in my mouth, he said, "oh, s&iacute;, papi, s&iacute;." Not knowing Spanish enough to recognize the word "papi," I'm not sure what it means, so I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not. Nevertheless, his thick cum tasted so good. It was savory, almost like eating spoonfuls of gravy, and I'm not exaggerating.  After he left, I did, too, figuring it wasn't the best idea to stay there. Plus, it was so damn hot and there was no shade at all. So I took off for one of my other places in the BA, Aquatic Park in Berkeley.  Once upon a time, almost five years ago, different life, different car, I was busted, evicted, and banned from this park for "indecent exposure." I was sitting alone with my dick out when I was caught by a cop. This wasn't an undercover copy, either. He was in full uniform, driving his Crown Victoria police cruiser to boot. I was too much into my fantasy to pay attention. That's what you get for being sloppy. He approached my open window, chastised me very loudly, took all sorts of information from me, and warned me never to come to this park again. No ticket, no fine, no problem. But in recent months, because I have a different car, I figured it was safe to return, and so far it has been safe and profitable! Besides, I've later been told that jacking off in the privacy of my own private car is not against the law. I'm no law expert, so I don't know.  When I arrived on Sunday, I quickly found a coveted parking spot and enjoyed the view. There were lots of people out enjoying the fine (and much cooler) weather of Berkeley. The cars around me shuffled position and owners too frequently to really get it on, but I had a good view of the drivers that parked. At one point, there was a guy next to me, shirtless, salt-and-pepper hair (which really turns me on), glasses, hairy chest and a little on the back (which also really turns me on). He was looking over every so often, and I took it upon myself to pop tall and show him a little something. He reacted positively and invited me to come over. I left my car, got into his car to find his shorts down around his ankles and a respectable, erect cock in his hands. I didn't even ask as I leaned over and took his cock in my mouth. His SUV as high enough off the ground that most people around couldn't really see much. I hadn't ever been this overt in this park before, and my previous indiscretion sprang to mind the moment I started fellating the guy. But thankfully, he came quickly, and I had yet another load to keep me and my stomach satisfied.  After sunset on this Sunday afternoon, I changed from my shorts to my jeans and got out to prowl the bushes of the park. These bushes are much more busy at night than they are during the day, and tonight was no exception. I walked about halfway down the park when I ran into one guy whom I'd seen there and at Niles Canyon many many times before. In fact, once at Niles Canyon, he walked in on me and another guy who I think is his partner/boyfriend/lover/whatever...they're always together as I sucked him off. This guy stood back and watched as I ate his friend's cock, and didn't offer me any of his. So when I saw him there tonight, I didn't know if he recognized me, but I sure recognized him. These two latinos are just so fucking hot, I can't stand it. I would love to be in a trio with them. They're cute and hunky and ooh, damn. Anyway, tonight, this guy grabbed his crotch and nodded for me to follow him. I instantly did as he wished and followed him to a sparse set of trees with a view of the lake but mostly hidden from the rest of the park. He pulled out his generous, thick, meaty uncut cock and, as I am prone to do in these situations, I melted in front of him just enough to take it all. He was a face-fucker, too, and his cock was so thick and long, I have to admit my gag reflex couldn't take the fucking. So I gently slowed him down a little so I wouldn't ruin this moment. After a while, he laid himself down on the grass and I cuddled up next to him, slurping his cock, while he ran his fingers through the hair on my head. I heard him groan, I felt him shoot, and he heard me groan as I started swallowing his hot load. After I finished getting every last drop from this beautiful man, we stood up, thanked each other, and went our separate ways. He's the kind of guy that I could get used to sucking off. I know I said what I said about fuck buddies and commitments, but this guy was fucking awesome.

      This weekend was set up for unrealized goals and sexual needs. For a long time, I had been meaning to go on a road trip in search of sex with strange men in strange places. So, on Saturday, I got in my car and drove 200 miles southeast of the Bay Area (BA) to a rest stop on Highway 99. This place is fabled as one of the cruisiest rest stops in California, and I had wanted to see it for myself.  I arrived at just after 7&nbsp;p.m. The sun was still up, and there was plenty of daylight left. I decided to take a short nap so I wouldn't be tired later on in the wee hours. Gotta be prepared, you know. I only napped for about an hour, though. This stop is closer to the highway than most rest stops are. In fact, the only thing separating the parking lot and the highway itself is a chain link fence and a five-foot ditch. My point is that it was really too loud from all of the traffic to sleep effectively.  At just about dusk, I saw a few more cars drive through. It wasn't as busy as I had expected, considering the amount of stories told about this place. I usually take most cruising stories with a grain of salt, but I was so horny that I  wanted  to believe what I had read. Still, I was there for the night and had to give it the benefit of the doubt. It wasn't until closer to 1&nbsp;a.m. that I had my first excursion, and that was due mostly to the looky-loo who had been the target of the flashing brake lights to which I responded. I guess it's a universal fact that men who cruise would rather their "trick" come to them instead of being the more daring and approaching someone else. There were, at one point, four big pickup trucks sitting, parking, driving through, flashing their brake lights, none of whom showing their faces. So when I saw the brake lights flash, and because I had been there for six hours camped out and hard as a rock, I jumped out of the car and almost ran down to the truck. For one thing, it was a big rig and I had never scored with a trucker before, but more importantly,  it had been six hours!   When I got to the truck, I found a big, burly, hairy, bare-chested guy sitting in his cab. I saw him and said, "all mine." I approached his window and chatted for two seconds before he invited me in. Two seconds after that, I was all over his cock, balls, and ass. Mmm mmm good. After he came copiously, we talked for a few minutes more, and I was on my way back to my car. I didn't get his name, but as with any other name I use here, I wouldn't post it if I had known it.  One thing I've learned about cruising me is that they're not always keen on being remembered. And you know what? Neither am I. I don't want a romance, I don't want the commitment of a relationship. Fuck, even a fuck buddy is too committed. So when it comes to anonymous, no-strings-attached gay sex, I'm your man.  So after I had finally had sex with a trucker in the privacy of his cab, I left and quickly found two other men who had needs to fulfill. One guy was probably straight and married because he didn't like it when I deviated from his cock. He quickly brushed my hand away when I tweaked his nipples through his tight wife-beater or when I started to grope his asshole. And when he came, he was real quick to shoo me out of his truck and practically burn rubber out of there. Sure signs of a man in fear of becoming a "homo queer." The big gold band on his big left hand said a lot, too. The third load I had was also from a married guy who openly proclaimed that my oral skills far surpassed those of his wife, to which I replied, "too much teeth?" "Yeah, and sometimes it hurts." Well, considering I have a dick, and considering how I like my blow jobs, I should be able to recreate the experience for someone else, for the most part, anyway. He was grateful and offered, I think jokingly, to take me home as his personal, live-in cocksucker, "wife be damned." Ha ha. As tempting as that may be, thanks, but no thanks. He was rugged and cute, and he did give me his name.  After that, the traffic in the rest stop (and the sex) died down a little bit. I sat in my car listening to Art Bell an AM radio to pass the time. I know I said that I wouldn't add social commentary here, but this guy is either spot on or a complete whack job. Pick one. That's all I'll say. The other entertainment offered at the stop this night was the various sexual acts committed out in the open for all to see or in the cars, pickups, and big rigs dotted here and there. I'm a voyeur as much as a participant. Sometimes watching two guys get it on is better than participating.  Round about sunrise, my fourth load of cum rolled in in the form of a business man on his way to work (on a Sunday morning). He parked right in front of me, flashed his light, to which I responded by meeting him at his window. He had his cock out and was gently stroking as he lowered his window. "Nice morning for a blow job, you think?" he asked. "Indeed," I replied, glad to be rid of small talk for this encounter. I opened his door as he pulled his pants down around his ankles and then reclined his seat. Being in an overblown and tricked-out pickup, his cock was nearly at mouth level and it was easy for me to go to work. His cock was absolutely beautiful, by the way, and I try not to judge cock size simply because it's a little rude to judge something that you can't change. It's like saying "ew, you have brown eyes." But this specimen was as close to my definition of perfect as I have seen in a long while. The thing was just about six inches long, not too thick, with a full and solid head. His load was thick and creamy, and it shot with the kind of force that I always remember: it hit the back of my throat. After cleaning up every last drop, Businessman thanked me, expressed his hope to run into me again, and drove off.  I left the place and set out on the road for the BA by 0800 hours. I was completely satisfied and not all that exhausted.

      This blog was created with the express intent to discuss and reveal a life of anonymous gay sex as experienced by an anonymous gay man,  BJ Cruiser . I have been cruising for sex for half of my life now, which no matter how old I am is a long time. I'm not going to get into the whole, sordid history of it all (much of it will be revealed through these entries anyway), but suffice it to say that I know my way around and love, love, love it. I'm totally horny all the time, and I love to seek out new cruising grounds to meet guys and engage in anonymous, consensual, adult, gay sex. And that's all there is to it. No politics, no theological discussions on whether we're all going to hell, no commentary on what Britney Spears is wearing in her latest video. There are far too many blogs that will detail all of this (and more!) for you to find. While this blog is devoted to my escapades, and while I don't expect to entertain everyone (or anyone, for that matter), I hope that it will bring insight or amusement to some people. And special note, the language in these entries will be frank and explicit. I intend it to be, and if you're easily offended or affected by frank speech, well, perhaps this isn't the right kind of topic for your perusal.

      ...while I had my mouth firmly clamped on the beautiful cock of a hairy bear the other night in the park, that the reason some people find this site offensive is that they're completely ignorant that such activity exists at all! I have been cruising for sex with men for fifteen years at least, and cruising for sex has been around for much much longer than any of us have been around. However, before the age of the Internet, most of this cruising for sex was handled very discreetly, with secret messages left in bathroom stalls. Now that we've got instant access to anything man can dream of  gr&acirc;ce &agrave; l'Internet , more and more people are discovering our little secret and are finding more reasons to tell us that we're all...wrong. But before I get too "preachy," I thought I would put that out there for consideration. Just because you're not familiar with this lifestyle or activity doesn't make it wrong and doesn't make it some new fad, either. It just makes you all a little more aware of who we are. Welcome to the club, so to speak.

      I had no idea what I was getting into when I decided to put my cruising experiences online. I mean, I should have seen this coming, but I didn't think it would erupt like this! I went to check the blog stats, very vain you know, and I saw over 5000 hits! WTF? Must be a mistake. It took over four years for my real blog to reach 5000 hits. Then I read some of the comments left here, and I realize it's for real. Wow.  So, let me just clear up a few things.    I suck dick only. I rarely ever fuck or get fucked. And when I do fuck or get fucked, I use a condom. And lots of lube. I like sucking more than fucking and so that's what I do. And I'm not about to debate with anyone the risk of transmission during oral sex. I'm just not gonna.  I get tested for HIV and other STDs as regularly as is prescribed by health professionals everywhere. I engage in "high-rish sexual encounters with persons of the same sex" and therefore do not donate blood. I don't sleep with women.  shudder  So there's no risk of infecting a woman with any possible STD that I may have or with my cum that would get her knocked up. I can't think how having to become a responsible adult would curb my appetite for cock, but from what I've seen, it's pretty common.   I  never  take cash or any other payment in exchange for sexual favors. Well, maybe a cigarette now and then. I'm not a prostitute. Being gay in Northern California, I think it's silly to pay for sex when you can find it anywhere you want. In fact, I was having lunch with a friend on Saturday in San Francisco. We walked past a building on Market Street, and my friend says, "Doesn't this place have a cruisy bathroom?" I replied, "Everywhere in San Francisco has a cruisy bathroom if you wait long enough." It's true. Men have sex all over the place, and if you sleep through it, that doesn't mean it doesn't happen! My god, people, wake up! No pun intended.  I'm doing what makes me feel good and what other consenting male adults deem feels good. I'm not hurting anyone. (I strive to not use my teeth as much as possible, regardless of girth.) If the other guy is married or otherwise cheating on a partner/significant other/whatever the fuck you call it, how is that my fault? He's the one who strayed to the rest stop/park/tearoom in the first place. I didn't drag him down there. Please.  I should interrupt this flow and tell you that while I was growing up in the medium-sized Iowa town that taught me the joys of sucking cock, I met a lot of guys who were both married and religious to the point of being almost evangelical. One guy that I met was a pastor in a farming town outside of my hometown who needed the release of orgasm with another man. When I first met him, I didn't know who he was, and after all was said and done, he wanted to talk to me about God. Whatever. I told him that I was an altar boy and being raised Catholic, and he seemed to think that that was good enough. I saw him almost regularly in the four years that I spent cruising before I joined the Navy. He never preached at me. In fact, one time, he even showed up in his minister's collar. Now that was hot!  I want to think that the world is becoming more enlightened, and that one day, we won't know the meaning of guilt or envy or shame. Anyone who looks on these posts and considers them to be afoul of human nature or of God's nature is in serious denial. Sexuality is part of the human experience, and to deny it is not only harmful to ones psyche and soul, it's dangerous to the flow of the world around us. We need to embrace our sexuality and cherish it for what it is. Why deny such a basic need? We need to stop lying to ourselves and allow ourselves to feel good about our bodies and what makes our bodies feel good. If you're gay, straight, lesbian, bi, transgendered, transsexual, whatever, follow your bliss and follow your heart. Do what feels right to you. As long as you're not hurting someone else, what difference does it make?   I fear that I've gone on a terrible tangent here, as I am naturally wont to do.  Thank you for writing and sending your comments. I'm glad to hear them. To those of you who compare this to "Steam," that's really cool; I miss that magazine (and Scott), too. To those of you who find it informative and entertaining, that's what it's meant to be. To those of you who find it repulsive, figure out what about it repulses you and look deep within yourself to see if that same thing is there inside of you. If it is, consider accepting it as part of yourself, or else consider a life of lies and denial and heartache. If it's not there, well, stop judging because I'm sure we can find something to throw through your glass house, mmmkay?  I'll post my exploits of Memorial Day weekend as soon as I can. Life happens, you know, and I haven't had a chance to finish typing it all out. Thank you for your patience and support.

      I was waiting for the elevator at my hotel last night, when I looked around to see a big side of beef staring back at me. I did a double-take, but he was still staring. I followed him into an empty elevator, he pushed his button, I pushed mine, and as we ascended, we stole furtive glances of each other through the mirrors of the lift. When he got off at his floor, he turned around and smiled, and I followed him off thinking that he would take me to his place. He said he was going to visit a friend, I gave him my room number, and he told me he'd stop by later.   I went back to my room as fast as I could to shower and clean the day's grime off me. I was determined to be as fresh for this hunk as I could be, if he showed up. About an hour and a knock at the door later, this man was naked and rolling around with me in my bed. It was unbelievably hot.   We spent three hours kissing, cuddling, hugging, making love. It was more passion and romance than I've had in so long I don't even know how long it's been.   Eventually, he gave me a raucous blowjob, he came an intense orgasm with our lips locked, and then he was gone.   No more sordid details.   He left me two of his phone numbers and his e-mail address. He leaves for Europe at the weekend, and we'll see if I ever hear from him again.   He was gorgeous. Big brawny chest. Beautiful blue eyes. Luscious lips. Embraceable arms. And a brain.   It was totally by chance. I wasn't looking for it. All I wanted was a glass of wine and a hot bath, and I ended up with a beautiful stranger in my arms for three hours of really hot sex.

      I've been really really busy for the last two weeks, and probably will be for the month of August, so bear with me. I'm headed out to the East Coast (not for the DNC, though that would be fun, wouldn't it?) for a week on business. I really hope I can find some cock out there. I know that our nation's capital must be teeming with high-strung men who need to shoot their loads down the willing throat of an anonymous cocksucker.  I was out and about what, two weeks ago already? I spent the night at vista point cruising my dick off. I tried to snag so many guys but there was always something that interrupted us. There was a cigar-smoking bear in a van who was so fucking hot I couldn't stand it. I tried to get on his cock, but there were so many straight couples up there fucking that he got too nervous and bailed. There was a trucker cruising the lot, a rare sight up there I must say, who would have been perfect to blow, but apparently he was looking for something else. I even offered him, out loud, "blow job?" He smiled and walked away. Fuck. But my release came along around 4 am, I'm up waiting for the sun to rise when a huge Ford F-250 diesel pickup pulled up right next to me. A very very cute bear nodded and smiled and I practically flew out of my sunroof to get at his cock. He was totally cute and cuddly-looking, but unfortunately not-to-well endowed. Still, as I've said before, as long as he cums, I don't care. He leaned back and let me do my work, and he was pleasantly surprised when I swallowed his load. He was fairly quick to zip up and get, but that's OK. I expect that. It was creamy and very tasty.  Later that morning, I went out to Aquatic Park and had two guys in a row.  I walked up to a big bear with a dripping cock in the bushes and didn't even ask. I got on my knees, took his cock in my mouth and sucked him to completion. He also was quick to get away. The other guy followed me way down the other side of the trails, right next to I-80, who then insisted that he suck me off. I let him, but I also got a chance to sample his load before he took off. I think it's so funny that guys are so desperate (or something I can't quite explain) to have their dick sucked, and then so desperate to get away from the "scene of the crime." Like running away will push it out of their minds faster. But that's life on the down low...or something.  I am itching to go out cruising real time. When I get back, I'm going to have to head south again. I love that place down there, and I miss it. That's strange. I know there's a 24 Hour Fitness down that way, and I've already got the plan all mapped out. Do I have anything better to do? No, this is what I do as I'm falling asleep, really.   Oh, and what galls me right now is that my hand-held tape recorder turned up missing or stolen. It was what I used to record all of my goings-on. I was at work one Saturday when I noticed it missing. For some reason, I'm ready to put the blame on this  SBC  who has it out for me. She's tried already to fuck up me and my work, and I simply won't have it. So I can totally see how she might try to get the upper hand by stealing my secrets on tape. Ha, if she did take it, I would love to have seen her face when she heard my exquisite detail of taking a married man's cock in my mouth and sucking out every last drop of cum. How funny. Anyway, that tape had almost a month's worth of tales on it, and they're all gone. Serves me right for not writing them all down first. I bought a new recorder and will make every effort, really, to keep my stories up-to-date. But thanks for visiting all the same.  Cheers, and happy hunting!

      Long time no post.  I spent the Fourth at the Vista Point looking at the fireworks on the delta. It was a pretty busy night, all things as they were, which turned out to be an impromptu cruise fest. I met a really nice guy who chatted with me for so long that we didn't get to fool around. Maybe next time, please. I ran into the RV Guy who I've seen before, but different from the Daddy down in Fresno. This guy likes to lay back on his bunk and unload his creamy spunk down the throat of an eager cocksucker. Last night, that was me. He's cute, and I think he's friendly, but when you're in his camper, it's all about the orgasm. No small talk. No sharing the joint. Just walk in, his shorts are already off, you do your business, he does his, and then you leave. That's pretty simple. That's why they call it anonymous.  There was one guy up there last night who I'd never seen before. He was a stud...a fucking stud...beautiful caramel skin, curly black hair, cool and limpid green eyes, in a sleeveless t-shirt and a big full luscious mouth. Unfortunately, though, before I got to get on it, a local cop pulled up through the parking lot, and dude was powered up and out of there. Scaredy cat, you know? That's not worth it for me. If you're going to freak just because the cops cruise the lot, too, and supposedly one of them does cruise for real, even when your pants are on and you're just watching the fireworks, I can't help you. So maybe I'll see him again someday, at least I hope so, and then we'll talk somewhere else. He needs a good knobber, I just know it.  I left around 11:30 pm, and drove east to Sacramento and then south down I-5 to another vista point I hadn't hit in a while. When I got there around 1 am, there was a car with a straight couple, and another car with an awesome Greek inside. His cock was primed and wet when I walked up to his window. He opened the car door and invited me to taste. He said the straight couple were too involved in their own coitus to be bothered by my fellatio. Well, that's nice, now, isn't it? He came pretty quickly, and it was a tasty load, I'll say. I hung out until daybreak and only sampled one other guy that came through. He was a big boy, I'm talking tall and wide, and a chain smoker. I am always leery about guys who smoke cigarettes while I'm smoking their poles. I just can't bear the thought of a hot ash burning my head. Now that  urlLink Joe the Barber  is buzzing me, I haven't got a lot to burn off before there's skin, and how the hell would I splain that one to the girls at work? Anyway, Big Boy couldn't come, so he left instead.   Later in the morning, I drove over to Niles Canyon for a looksee. I got there around 8 am, and there were already a few cars in the lot. The holiday, must be. I quickly hit the trails and found one guy eagerly jacking off on one of the trails. I said, "here, let me," and in seconds, I was on my knees sucking this guy to completion. He was a screamer, I could tell, because he had to cover his mouth during the orgasm so as not to alert everyone to our presence. That was funny. I've met a lot of guys, and most of them just breathe hard, like they're afraid to make any noise while they're coming like it'll make 'em more fey or something. When I first started fucking, the guy who was showing me the ropes told me to let it out, make some noise, whatever I felt when I had my orgasm. Since then, I have developed a bit of a voice, but still, in the woods, it's best to keep it to a minimum. Whatever.  After he left, there was a cute Hispanic guy waiting for my mouth. He took forever to shoot his huge load out of his tiny balls, and I was glad to have him gone. There was something about him that kinda struck me wrong, so I ended up jacking him off and watched him come instead.   And then! Oy! I was walking back to my car, watching the ground so I wouldn't trip over a wayward tree root, when I almost bumped into this dream of a man. I mean, this guy was so my type, I did a double take. And then I had a mini anxiety attack. I have always had a bit of a problem with guys who I thought were too good to be true. It's an insecurity thing, I know, and I should be over it by now. But every once in a while, I meet a guy who is just drop dead gorgeous and I can't move. This guy was one of those. And he was interested, too. I won't lament this here because I've done enough of it in my own head. But it was necessary for me to share that.   And then I came home, tired and sweaty and day-old. I joined  urlLink 24 Hour Fitness  a couple of months ago, so I should really take advantage of all the California locations while I'm out on the prowl. Not only can I get a workout, I can take a shower and clean myself off, and maybe even get some in the locker room! I love 24 hour anything. It's so ace. I can't wait to explore that just so I can write about it here.
