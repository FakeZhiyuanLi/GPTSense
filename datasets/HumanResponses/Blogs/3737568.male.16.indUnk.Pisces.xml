      The day started off with me sleeping in (as I do when you’re on holidays, partly more of that later) into Canberra’s icy winter morning starts at about -10 degrees Celsius. After telling my self I should get up after two hours of lying in bed think about how cold, windy and generally dodgy the weather was outside I managed to coax myself out of bed and get ready for my fun eventful "miniday" at college. What is a miniday you ask? well its where you go in to your classes for about 2 minutes get your marks back see how bad you went, think “well I could of done better in that but I didn't, oh well”.... then leave. Pretty stupid invention if you ask me. You’re telling students to voluntarily turn up to school, do nothing but see how bad they went then go home. All with the weather being like its in sub-Antarctic…. in winter!    I think it’s a sham. Foolish teachers trying, and succeeding, to irritate students who are basically on holidays other than these meagre couple of hours they have to wait at school for when they could be out (trying) to have fun somewhere. Anyway where was I. after that I went home trying to keep my hat from getting blown away by the furious winds that were flying by swirling man, animal and woman into a vicious windstorm of destruction…...well maybe not that insane, but it was windy ok. So I get home and sit down for about five minutes read my newly purchased monthly issue of Atomic when the phone would ring and who would it be, who else rings you just when you think its safe to have fun again?.   Work, just when you think its safe to have fun again. They were kind enough to ring me up about three hours before I was supposed to start there saying I’m not needed. Well that’s crap since I’m poor and I need money to fund the ludicrously expensive computer I’m trying to save up for but cant due to that fact that I have to live. Splurge. So I go and tell my mate, who is over as usual since…well…I don’t know I think he was here when we moved in actually and my sister who thinks my dog is a real person and that you should talk to him and act as though he is a person in all respects of the word (by the way my sister is 19 turning 20 this year…yeah scary isn’t it) that work rang me and said that they don’t need me to work. Well. They both said that “you should of got them to pay you for your shift since they didn’t give u more than 24 hours notice etc.” I’m like shit guys you need to tell me this before the situation happens so I can get some free money and to that they responded in their usual dull sultry manner “whatever” so I sat down and tried to figure out what I was going to do for the rest of the night……I still am and its not the evening anymore, it’s the morning. So essentially I did nothing to of worthy note for humankinds existence on this arctic day on the 24th of July 2004.   Fare thee well.
