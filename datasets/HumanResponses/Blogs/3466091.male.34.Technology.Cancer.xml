      A tornado swept through Lexington last night.  It was accompanied by a huge thunder storm.  150 homes were damaged, 50 of them were completely destroyed.  One of my offices is on generator power.  It may be a couple of days before power is restored.  My wife and I sat up on the top floor of our house watching the lightning.  All the while the weather man on TV was telling everyone to get to the lower floors and take cover.  I guess we aren't too smart.    The electricity went out for a few seconds.  It blew out one of my computer monitors.  It's dead.  It was my newest monitor.  It probably just blew a fuse...I'll pop it open this weekend and see what's wrong with it.

      I just got back from a two week vacation.  I'm back to the beat and grind of my life.  I spent most of the time with my wife's family.  I really love my wife's family.  It seems as time goes on I've become closer to my wife's family than my own family.  They really are fun.   I decided a while back that I need to assign all of my responsibilities to my direct reports.  I took a vacation 2 years ago, that turned into a big nightmare.  I was on the phone the whole time, and I really was just miserable.  That's when I decided that I needed to make myself not needed.  I restructured my business unit and assigned all of my responsibilities to my employees.  It's worked out great.  If you can't be replaced, you can't be promoted.        I'm finding it really hard to get back to work.  I've been keeping busy, but I keep looking at the clock waiting for 5:00 PM to roll by so I can leave.  I usually like to work, so I feel bad about that.  It must be spring fever.    It's raining and storming here in Lexington.  There is a tornado warning for the county.

      I started working out a week ago.  I was doing really good last year.  Winter came, and I got real sick.  I have a little COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) that springs up in the winter time.  Basically, I have a little difficulty breathing sometimes.  Especially during the winter.  It makes me cough, and I just get worn down from coughing so much.    Anyways, I started working out again, and I'm really pumped.  This is my workout for right now.  I'll change it each week or so.  1. 35 minutes cardio on the elliptical.  My favorite routine is the random, which randomly changes the resistance each 3.5 minutes.   2. 3 sets of 15 dumbbell extensions from the bench. 3. 3 sets of 15 dumbbell fly's from the bench. 4. 50 situps from the lat bench with a 10 lb. Weight.    I need to loose a few pounds, but I hope to replace that with muscle.  I weigh 205 right now, and I wouldn't mind gaining a few pounds.  My body fat scale says I'm 20% body fat.  I would like to drop that down to 12%. I'm feeling most of the workouts in my upper arms and chest.
