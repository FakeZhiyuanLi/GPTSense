        It's raining today, something I'm very happy about.   Everytime it rains it reminds me of the clash and I love that. Well anyways, yesterday I hung out with Crystal and we went to a couple of places, first we were at Barnes and Nobles then we went to Tower Records where we made fun of Hilary Duff. Then we went to Blades but we weren't there for a long time like literally 3 minutes tops. Then we went to Rickys which was fun, we looked at some t-shirts that were really cute and we plan on buying when we have money. Then we went to Urban Outfitters where we looked at cool guy t-shirts and chilled in the awesomely comfy chairs. Then I had to go pick up my sister so I left and she left. Today, I went to Community Service and then came home, Crystal couldn't hang out, I was really sleepy and didn't really wanna hang out. I came home and slept until like 2 then I got tired of staying home so I went outside. I went to the Shops at Columbus Circle where I couldn't find a seat to sit down and read Rule of the Bone by Russell Banks. That book is really good but I can't really relate to it and there are so many sad parts to it that I cannot at all see myself in those positions. Anyways, so I went back out and walked to Tower Records I went upstairs and looked at some cool books. Then I went downstairs and looked at some CDs I wanted to get The Killers so badly but I couldn't because I was broke man I can't wait until school starts cause then I start getting paid again and I'm gonna save like a bitch I'm not gonna spend any money until I have like $500+ man that would be sweet. I would buy my own computer or something. Damn 47 days left of summer. I'm ready for school again. I wanna have a buy life when school starts. Monday Through Friday: School, Community Service, homework. Saturday Sunday: Promote, Seaport. Damn that's gonna be so sweet if I can pull that off. I will be so happy :). Well I'm gonna go do some small cutesy things.

        Waking up early sucks so much. I have to wake up at 7 in the morning Monday through Friday. I hate that. But I gotta do it. Anyways I went to community service today, it was alright. As good as work gets I guess. Later I'm going to meet up with Crystal at Barnes n' Nobles. I wanna hang out more because. I need to make plans with Natalia. I haven't hung out with her in a long time. I wanna hang out with Diamond too but Crystal said she is hanging out in Brooklyn and skateboarding a lot. The last time I talked to her was when she asked if I could hang out, I wanted to but I couldn't cause I had to pick up my glasses. Oh well, I know we have hang out atleast once this summer cause I have a little present for her from The Core Tour. I gave Clare the present I got her last Friday. She didn't say anything about it so I don't know if she liked the stuff or not. I want to make the best of July cause I have a feeling August is going to suck. Unless ofcourse my family gets it's act together and makes plans to go to Six Flags and other amusement parks. I need to start reading the summer books from school. I chose such huge books that I don't know if I'm going to be able to finish them. Maybe I'll go to the park today with Farah and she can read her book and I can read mine. Yesterday Farah said some stuff that really scared me. She said that she attempts to kill herself by holding her breath because she thinks that I don't want her in my life. I told her sometimes people get upset and says things but she can't take them that seriously. I don't know what's gonna happen I need to talk to my mom about it. Anyways...I really wanna do more volunteer work so I have stuff to put for my college applications. I think I'm going to volunteer at P.S.191 next school year. And I e-mailed the people from Seaport so I'm hoping they call me often to volunteer for them cause I can do the P.S.191 thing monday through friday and then Saturday and Sunday I either do the Seaport thing or the split7 records thing. I need to e-mail them because my mom approved so I'm happy. But I need to tell Crystal that my mom approved. I'll tell her when I meet up with her. Well I have nothing else to say so....
