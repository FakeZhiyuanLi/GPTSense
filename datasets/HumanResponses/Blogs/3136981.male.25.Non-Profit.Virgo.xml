      Ah...  so...Lois Lane got keyed up about the blog again.  It is nice to see she still has it in her to be a bitch when she wants to.  I miss ya already. (and I look forward to the response!)  On a side note, if you are bored and are looking for something to do in Richmond this eve, you should check out  urlLink this link.    Talk about the original "one _hit_ wonder". HAW! I crack myself up sometimes.  Regards,  Brett

      Hmm...  well...if you are anything like me (and I hope you are NOT), you have just woken up (3:42 in the afternoon), to the grumblings of 2:30 am DQ blizzard, that you ate...not realizing you are lactose intolerant.  So...  As this frozen treat passes through me like water through a sieve, I encourage you to check out some of these odd-ball sites I have been to in the last few days. Most are interesting, and even have free software you can download.  1. the Knoppix Website :  urlLink Knoppix   Knoppix is a nifty version of Linux that you can burn onto a CD. It comes full-featured with a browser, and allows you to launch into Linux off of a CD...really cool, because you used to have to format a chunk of your hard drive for such a task.  2. The MythTV project :  urlLink MythTV   This dude has dedicated the last few years of his life to programming a VERY stable linux-run, free version of a Tivo Emulator. Here is the deal...his whole thing is completely free, and includes DVD emulation software, a networking media link, that will play most Mpeg encoded stuff, Mp3s and here is the kicker...it includes a MAME emulator. So...go out and get yourself a beat PIII box for $100...jack it up with a $45 DVD player, and a $55 video out card w/5.1 sound, and you will have yourself a full-featured computer/tivo style box that can play DVDs, movies, Mpegs AND all classic Atari, Nintendo, Sega and other games for about $200....Of course if you are like me, you already have a heap of old-ass computers laying around...so for about $100, you can have yourself a bitching box for a media center. Pretty wild, eh?  3. and finally... Zuma! :  urlLink Zuma   This is a terribly addictive flash game. Neat and...as they would call it 15 years ago... "educational" (Yeah...right....remember when tetris was "educational"?) Actually, it is a brilliant diversion...try not to spend more than 60 on it a day.   So...go out...have fun...hack your computer apart, and think of me while you try to screw all of the pieces back together.  Best to each of you.  Love,  Brett

      Why is it that _I_ am the one who feels so hurt, when in fact I really ended up hurting the other person?  Perhaps it is because, contrary to what men are instructed, we CAN'T talk through everything.   Sometimes in life you end up hurting people and there simply isn't a resolution.  So, why does it always happen on one of the most important days in one's life?  Perhaps it is because, buried deep down inside of me is a real jerk.  A genuinely mean person I have tried for the last 5 years to forget.  He creeps out at the _Worst_ times.  Apologies don't make up for his actions.  But believe me...I'm sorry.  Yours,  Brett

      hmm...  What is the deal with grown adults collecting toys?  I have fallen prey to it...though I don't quite consider myself to be an "adult" yet.  Are these cheap, mass-produced mini-statues really that exciting.   Certainly, they are more exciting if they stay in their celophane bastille.   Let the toys out!  Comments?

      ...Okay...now that I got that last post off my chest, it is time for me to talk about a topic which touches me...deeply:   Masturbation   What an interesting phenomenon this topic is. For several years I have claimed the following:  "I have a VERY healthy sex life...now I am just looking for someone to share it with." heh heh...  Does anyone else remember the Gilbert Godfried (sp?) sketch at the Oscars that got him "blackballed" from the industry for about half a decade regarding masturbation? What a joke!  Oh...and this is rich...the fact that women don't do it...HAH! I know for a FACT that Miss Lois Lane masturbates as much as possible. Oh...and if you chastize her about it in the morning....woooboy! Watch out! Ugly Ugly!  This of course spins me into the other direction....Is pornography bad?  Well...let's take the flipside...Is voyeurism bad? Because, of course, THAT is what is so exciting about pornography.  People don't get aroused by simply SEEING folks do it, but rather the fact that they are catching a raw glimpse into a very real, and quite frankly, interesting activity.   So...Voyeurism and masturbation. I raise two hands in support of ...well... Actually, my left hand is quite busy at the moment....um...I'll finish this conversation later.

      Have you ever met a TRULY dispicable person? I mean, a really WRETCHED person, to their empty cold soul?  I never thought I had until about a month ago. I met this unfortunate young lady. Let's call her "Tiffany".   Tiffany is the type of person who blames EVERYONE else for her problems, but never admits that she is the one that causes ALL of them.   Tiffany whines on and on about not having ANY friends, but obviously fails to look at the source of her problems.   Granted I have only known this person for a month, but it is alarmingly apparent to me that she is the most scared, self-absorbed, REDICULOUS person I have ever met.   Now, I TRY...I really _do_ try...to find the good in people. I attempt to always look at the flip-side of a coin. As of yesterday I really almost felt sorry for poor Tiffany. I have never met anyone whine and moan so much about being so poor and broke and miserable.  Until I found out that Tiffany lives in a country mansion.   Cry on someone else's shoulder Tiffany. I am not lifting another finger for you. No more pity from me. EVER.  You should be ashamed of the people you have hurt. The people you told that you loved, and the people that you continue to saddle YOUR financial burdens on.   If I was a church-going individual, I would pray for you everyday. Thank Gawd you found religion...you will definitely need it.  Best,  Brett

      Bill...I am soooo jealous.  Bonnaroo sounds like a blast. I had two tickets last year, but could not make it due to scheduling issues. What a ball-buster.  Don't do anything I wouldn't do.  Also...a bit of a rant on comic books. I have read at least 20 comics cover to cover in my life. I know you may not believe it, but it is true.  Here are my top titles of all time. If you ever have the pleasure to read them, you will know what I mean. If you DON'T...too bad for you!  1) Justice Leage (1986) 1-60. The best comic book run of all time. Period. Best ever: When booster and beetle rob the league to build a casino on a living island. BWAH-HAHAHAHA!  2) Major Bummer. Almost made it to first. only lasted 15 issues...but greatest 15 contiguous issues EVER!  3) Thanos issue 1-6. I really, REALLY don't like "cosmic" books. They seem so lame. Probably why I never got into the Legion, or Silver Surfer, but this book was quite a bit of fun. I just wish Starlin lasted a bit longer on it.  4) Quantum and Woody. The only thing published by Acclaim that was original, and laugh-out-loud high-larious. Best scene...of course:  Quantum and Woody switch bodies. This is fine and dandy until they have to go pee. So...easy solution...stand beside each other at the urinal, and hold each-other's pieces. Who writes this stuff?!?! Would you believe it is a fellow named "Priest"?  5) Get Kraven. A Fabulous 6 issue mini series. Drawn and written so well. Puts hollywood execs in their place. Cool!  Ok...That is the short list. Of course it doesn't even begin to list the various books I read right now, which include: Flash, Green Lantern, Hard Time and a bunch of other things. Sorry...but anyone reading this that wants to get into comics should at least check out the collected paperback of "Transmetropolitan" and "Formerly Known as the Justice League". Great books. Truly. Just ask Miss Lane. She has read each of them.   Good night, Lois.  Love,  Brett

      Two quick things:  First: I _NEVER, EVER, EEEEVVVVEEERRRR_ want to hear information second hand again.  Stop it. Right now. No more BS from anyone. No more Roomates talking to mothers who might have heard something, but didn't quite know. No more Mothers who heard something talking to fathers who may or may NOT have heard something.   No more BS. Period. If I don't hear it from the horse's mouth, I ain't believing it. Period.  Second: Quit acting self-ritious like all of your sh*t is more important, and you don't have time for anyone else. F*ck you. We hate it, and it makes you look like a pretention pr*ck. Both of you know who you are.   Finally, this is for someone who has helped my company grow through the fat and lean times. I know you won't read this post, but I really am grateful to you. I hope you enjoy the new corner office.  Regards to all. And...  get a grip.  Best,  Brett

      Have you ever tried to co-ordinate one little thing, but there are 3 or more people in the party that is doing that little thing?   Somehow EVERTHING becomes an ordeal. Time to slap the balls on, and make executive decisions. Too bad executive decisions can be completely cut in half by the first ladies.   Ughhh....  Here's a tip for women: Make a rational decision...tell everyone what time and where to be, and just DO IT.   Oh yeah...same goes for spineless guys: DO WHAT THE WOMEN TELL YOU... makes life a lot easier.  Of course you can always do what YOU want to do, and screw whomever gets in your way...man or beast....  Like listening to the Grateful dead, outside on a patio while eating trash.  ...Sometimes you DO get what you want after all of the squabble.   Thanks guys.

      okay, okay...so the last post was a little out-of-character for me. I am generally a mild-mannered reporter for a major metropolitan newspaper who wants nothing more than the affections of little Miss Lane.   So...some good things in my life.   1) three weeks ago one of my best buddies in the world bestowed an honor upon me which is both humbling, and a tad ego-inflating. He asked me to be his best man. Now, this dude is a strange cat to say the least, but I love him to death. Thanks, man. You really know how to cheer up a fellow who is having the blues.  2) I often find myself facing overwhelming anxiety. I have those "God, I really don't want to get out of bed today" days. Today was one of those days. If anyone has experienced mild depression before, do you know that strange weight that can set in on your shoulders, and drag you around all day? That same feeling that makes you second guess even the surest of actions? Well...I woke up to one of those days today. I cannot explain it, only say that the best thing to do is to work your tail off. Today I handled comic complaints at the store. Great stuff like "What is the cover price of this 28 year old bundle of paper? Gosh, is it 30 cents or 35 cents? Because if it is 30 cents, I don't want it, but if it is 35 cents, I gotta have it, and will bid through the roof." WHO CARES?!?!?! It's a smelly bit of paper. Read it because you enjoy it, dammit! So...basically, I answered peoples BS for a few hours, and got one of the more tedious...and diplomatic tasks out of the way.   I have also sucessfully unloaded an entire truck of comics by myself. Not really an AMAZING task...but certainly contradictory to my typical sit-around-the-place lazy spells. I am about to take off from work here in an hour (10:30 pm) to clean up my part of the house. Damn...who is writing this Blog again? Ha!  3) I am looking forward to tomorrow night. I will be having dinner with three truly fantastic people. One person I met remotely a few months ago, but have since had some splendid converstaions with. The other two people I have known for several months. And to them I say: L - I don't know why you put up with me, but you are a saint. B - It is fantastic to have you back in my life. I look forward to seeing our friendship grow.  4) Yesterday I hired a person to step in as a part-time manager of the comic shop. Why, you may ask....well.... Up until now, _I_ have been manager of the store. Anyone who knows me will understand what that means. I am great at analyzing and dissecting situations. I can probably sell ice to an Inuit, but I often have trouble seeing the bits and pieces of running a company. Hopefully this fellow will help to be my "ears" while I continue to be the "eyes". On a passing note, if anyone has NOT seen the "pile", just shoot me an email. It is an odd thing to see, but it is truly overwhelming to actually walk through it. Fantastic!  5) I forgot to pay the phone bill, and they shut me off. Actually not too bad at all...I hate the telephone. There is nothing that drives me up the walls faster than a ringing phone. And if you call me after 10 pm? I feel sorry for you. It should be on in the next 48 hours...but my god, how fantastic these next 48 hours will be ....ahhhh.....  So...Happy but tired...sounds like a full day's worth of work to me. Best to all of you, and have a fantastic week. Check back for more BS from BSC.  Best,  Brett

      Ughh...ok...now it is time for me to bitch about the one institution I bet EVERYONE could do without: The IRS  I know this one poor sap...Lets call him...say..."bsc"...for hypothetical's sake. Poor ol' bsc was wandering through his life thinking that he has paid all of his taxes out of pocket for the year of 2003 via withheld salary. Awesome! Great! The rock and mineral shop holds out his wages so he doesn't have to puncture a lung when April 15th rolls around.  HAHAHAHAHA!  What a grand joke on him. The Calander rolls back a bit, and he is smacked with having to pay-down $4800 ADDITIONAL money to the IRS, on top of the cash with-held. This is lovely because he had already busted ass all year to save up the meager $3000 to plunk into an IRA account, which in effect means...bsc will have $3000 more dollars when his kidneys give out in 40 years to eat gov't cheese.  are you with me now? Witheld salaries to the tune of 32%, PLUS $4800.  and then this poor bastard get AUDITED!?!?!?! WTF?!?! poor bsc has to sell his left testicle to conjure up ANOTHER $1920!!! Good crap! that is almost $2000.  Oh well...at least it is made easier by being told he owes $2300 additional in property taxes on a building that he may or may not own in trust with TWO other people, and has never seen the deed for, nor has he seen proceeds of, because bsc's pop fleeced it from him systematically over the last 4 years.  And the kicker?  BSC's problems are nothing. I know two people who have been slapped with tax bills from the last 4 years they didn't even know about.  to the tune of $12k+  so don't feel sorry for BSC. Feel sorry for everyone else.  Thanks IRS...we love ya!  Best,  Brett

      OK...It's been quite a while since I have posted much of doodely-squat on this here page. So...let's change that as there are many things in my life that are beautiful, and quite a few things in my life that are ugly.   I have many things that I am fortunate for. The first is my parents, whom I believe deeply love me, and want me to succeed as an individual.   Unfortunately, my parent's vision of "success", I _think_, involves working for them at some level. It is quite difficult for my parents to believe there is any level of success to be achieved by hoc'ing old paper.   Granted they are most likely right, but isn't that MY decision...through ACTIONS...to succeed? I think it is, and I will try everything in my power to be a success. So far I have made the following successes this year:  1) Solidified myself as a business owner on the path of success 2) quit not one, not TWO, BUT THREE substance abuse habits 3) met and helped to morally and mentally support a beatiful person 4) hired a cracker-jack team of people to run my company 5) reduced my outstanding debt using _MY_ resources by 85% in 5 months 6) bought and have begun rebuilding a historic structure  Now...why do my parents still harp on me?  You wouldn't believe it if I told you, but it is because they love me.  As opposed to other parents who either abandon or reject their child, or some of those who simply see their offspring as a mental whipping post, I am pleased to have my parents in my life.  Now I wish they would simply back off a bit.  Thanks.  -Brett

      Hmm...  So, I am always working at these silly comic book conventions. It is really good fun for meeting folks that make me feel a LOT better about myself.   You know...when you are feeling down in the dumps for being a bit overweight, short, having red hair and very pale skin. Well..maybe not...but trust me...whatever your physical or mental affliction is, keep it in your mind.  Now...Go out to your local comic book convention. You will feel a Helluva lot better...trust me.  They should truly have a deal made out with the rite-guard folks and the Heating and air-conditioning folks. If we could get some antibacterial anti-perspirant in the air of these events, we would all live a tad easier.  Well then, now to the point of this blog. Someone at a recent convention tried to convince me to read Aquaman. Well..I have never really read aquaman, because I always thought he was a lousy rip of a marvel comics character named "Namor the Submariner"... who also happened to be the first ever Mutant, and first ever Marvel superhero. So...aquaman seems quite lame when compared to ol' Namor ("Roman" backwards) who wanted nothing more than the death and destruction of the human race for polluting his underwater kingdom. Neat!  So...I go out and get one of these $50 hardcover archives of all of Aquaman's tales from the 1960s. This is a good place to start because of the short stories and ease of reading. This book covers Aquaman's origins and all of the other dull stuff about him.  I used to think Aquaman was lame.  Now I KNOW he is lame.  What a sh!tty character. No wonder I never read about this guy. All of the funny stuff people say about this character is true. His best friend is an octopus. He dies if he is out of water for 1 hour. his uniform blows.   In one story, he acts as a police officer for Venice, and issues speeding tickets for passing boats. What splendid cleverness. Superman is out destroying sun-eating giants, and aquaman is busy using electric eels to help politicians make glowing election signs. Lame. Super-lame.  Mad weak.  Most superheros are dumb. Aquaman just happens to be the dumbest.  Regards,  Brett

      So...as a young man of....peculiar shape...I had a rather fun experience yesterday.  Now...keep in mind that this experience has two facets.  The first facet is that my deodorant ran out yesterday. No worries...I will put on some baby powder,and everything will be fine...Right?  WRONG!  After 35 minutes on the hamster-machine at the gym, I do a series of wacko ab excercies...so when I lose another 30lbs, you may see some definition.  Well... As everyone knows, I am a perspirated monkey. I sweat simply by thinking of work. It truly sucks. This is even better in our unventilated bathroom at home, where the sun pours in, and I sweat bullets whilst making waste, not haste.  This is fine, and dandy, as I sit there pouring sweat while I do my business. One must never forget that the root word of "toilet" is "toil". Keen. And then I have to peel myself off the seat and take a shower because I am drenched...  Sorry for the tangent.  Here is where not wearing deodorant and going out in public comes in real handy: See...ol' Lois drags me out to the arcade. Now...this arcade doesn't totally suck. They have all of the old school games that I actually enjoy playing. You know...skeeball...Galaga, Ms. Pacman and the such.  Well, they also have this crazy thing called DDR-Max. The basic jist of this thing is to hop like mad onto this pad on the floor in beat to the music...kind of like a physical UnJamma Lammi (for those of you who have seen this Opiate inspired game...it is truly sick).  Well...I get my funky-fresh white a$s up onto this thing, and set the program for level 1 (I think it goes up to level 10). You are supposed to get 3 shots at playing the game. Now...also important...the game only has 4 buttons. Any old fool can do this right? Certainly a 26 year old college graduate who has been listening to Phish for the last 4 years can do it. Hell...I have rythm...Right?  WRONG!  The game ejected me in the middle of round 2. Yep...the 3 round game booted me off in the middle of round 2. On level one. This is especially humbling because just before were two 12 year olds working the sh!t out of the thing on like level a million before I got all sweaty and funky on the thing.  So...short answer...stick me with joystick controlled, single button games. Thank you Namco.  Ughh...  -Brett

      Whew...  Ok...it is 5:25 in the AM, and I am about to go to bed.  But before I do...I think I should tell everyone that I have FINALLY found the right cell-phone. Here is a photo of it:    On an entirely different note, most people know that I am not political at all. I hate to say it, but I am pushing 26 years of age, and have NEVER cast a vote, other than for a school election.  Of course, with snappy lines like this from our president, who knows...I may show up this year:     Whew...  That is about it. Oh yeah...one more thing....ladies, those topless photos haven't arrived yet...what's the hold up? If you need a private photo sitting, just let me know.  Best,  Brett

      Not much happening today.  I went to the vet, which is good. They said my balls finally dropped. Keen.  Today is payday, so I get to write another pile of bad checks. that usually rocks.  I am REALLY looking forward to going to the gym today. Nothing more attractive than seeing a fat white kid sweat through his undies. Really.  On a passing note, if you know what TV show the following frame is from, give yourself a 1-way ticket to nerdsville.      Best,  Brett

      And now for something completely different.  Questions I ask myself when no one is around:  1) Why in the world would anyone want to have single-ply toilet paper.   2) What clever person came up with smoking? Hmm...let's see...take these leaves...dry them...wrap them in paper...IGNITE THEM...and then inhale while trying not to cough.  3) Why are drug dealers busted by the police, while a bar is nothing more than a licensed distributor of one of the most wicked substances ever discovered. If Alcohol was discovered today, it would have all of the properties of schedule I drugs...such as Crack and Heroine.  4) Why can't kids afford comic books anymore, but the typical pack of Yu-Gi-OH cards is in the $4.60-$6.25 range.  And finally...  5) Why the Heck did B103 change to P*ssy 103.7 ?!?   Best,  Brett

      Hmm...  I had an interesting conversation with Miss Lois Lane today. It seems as if she has passed the address of this blog around the Daily Planet, and even furthur into this wonderful Gore-invented World Wide Web...more commonly referred to as the "Internet".  So...Basically, there are dozens of women out there having a good chuckle at the exploits of the writer of these passages.  Of course, having dozens of women laughing at me is nothing new...but now I have heard about it first hand. No more is it a mere rumor.  So...This leaves me to the following proposal.  As I have so openly exposed myself via the prose of these postings, I invite all young ladies to expose THEMSELVES to me.   Just click the link to shoot me an email, and attach the most revealing photos of yourselves you can muster. Don't worry...I have seen it all...but here's a tip...I'm a total T & A freak. So...use that to your creative minds' whim, and be clever, dammit!  I am talking landscape, motorcycles, public exposure, whatever. Just send me naked photos of yourself.  Oh yeah...please be over the age of 18. A scan of a drivers license, credit card, ATM number and mother's maiden name will suffice to prove you are as legal as the Olson Twins.  Best...and thanks in advance,  Brett

      Everyone knows I am a gadget freak.  Yeah...I'm that one dude that had the Atari Lynx. And all 6 games they put out for the f*cker rocked!  Another thing that everyone knows: Brett doesn't own a cell phone.  Well...  Too many missed biz opportunities have necessitated that I get one of the infernal contraptions.   The only problem is....they have become too darned...neat!  So...I roll into the Sprint store (Ask Goodlovin'...I went to EVERY wireless store that exists)...this afternoon to finally sign up for the program.  They have the neatest phones by far. Sure...my buddy Mikey got the Bluetooth compatible something or other phone that allows him to change ring tones, and wirelessly control his i-tunes, but the thing I looked at blows the socks off of that.  It has a fully-functional web-browser, and LOADS of other programs. You know...everything you could possibly want. Hell...it even had something like 68 thousand different colors...which means you can get boobs on the screen, and then look lifelike....as lifelike as a 1.5 x 3" display CAN look.  So...are you with me....I pick out THIS brick of a phone:     Just what every broke comic dork needs...more bullsh*t for the utility belt...To accompany a wallet full of receipts, but devoid of cash, and about 40 keys.  I have to slap down another $250, because my credit sucks...PLUS $500 for the phone, and a bunch of other hassle to port my current number.  so...$750 BEFORE I can make the first telephone call. We yak at the sprint place for another half hour, and then there seems to be a problem.  What could it be?  Um...well...  It seems as if this brick of a phone that I have selected is SOLD OUT. Oh yeah...it isn't just sold out in Sh*t Pump, it is also sold out at the South side, AND Colon-ial Bites.   Oh...They also don't know when they are getting more in, because the "Warehouse doesn't work like that". Um...ooookay.  Seems as if I am destined to never have a cell phone. No worries...you can still get in touch with me via...um...smoke signals.  Best,  Brett

      Crud.  I know I am normally very Puritan in my postings of late, but even though... it appears I have used certain "naughty" words which have been deemed violating to Lois Lane's blocker software they installed over at the Daily Planet. So...I took a few moments to clear things up.  Let me know if it allows the following "clean" words:  c*ck c*nt d*ck sn*tch p*ssy sh*t f*ck as*h*le  and, of course:  ch*cken-f*cker  "Don't worry Kooper...he's just trying to feed his robot family."

      Don't you love it when there is that new gadget that you gotta get, and it isn't available ANYWHERE?  This past winter, it was that nifty "plug it into your TV" joystick that had 6 classic Namco games on it like Packman and such.  Now it is this damned Ipod Mini.   This filthy thing has been haunting me ever since my cousin-in-law (?) got one for his birthday.  Hell yeah, I want one!   I have been trying to get one for MONTHS. The f*ckers are tough as dog-balls to get. What the Heck!?! Apple advertises the bejeezus out of these things, and then they are impossible to find.   Reminds me of the Reebok pumps, and when Nintendo released "Double Dragon".   What a bitch!  I even ordered one off of X10.com, when they said ipod minis were "in stock" and guaranteed. So...what do these punks do? Well...apparently "in-stock" means "we don't have 'em...but we will be more than happy to slap you on our several email lists to hock our lame-o paranoia surveillance kits."  Yeah...like what I want is to have some silly camera make sure no-one is getting into my computer when I'm not at home...  I want a butt-load of MP3s on a sick little device and I want to be the envy of kids and grown-ups NOW, Dammit!  I am certain by time I get the ipod mini I will be the least cool kid on the block, and that will suck, because, as we all know, having tons of crap is what makes people happy...right? I think Jeezus said that somewhere down the line:  Get junk, stimulate the American economy, listen to noise.  It's 5:15 in the AM.  Im sacking out.  Best,  Brett

      A beautiful Sunday afternoon to you guys! For those of us that were blessed with having a three day weekend....too bad, folks...it's almost over.  On the upswing, it seems as if Lois Lane is a bit happier today. We cracked a month long no-drinking rule and went out for some post-birthday fun last eve.  It was a good time. Lois was able to get double digits, which totally boosted her female-reporter ego.   She did the ol' batting eyelashes trick to try to nab a free drink off of Jimmy Olson. Unfortunately, it backfired when, not only do we discover Jimmy is broke, he is ALSO drunk off his can, and decides to come home with us.   After about 2 hours of beautiful conversation with Jimmy about such things as "The F*ckin' Smith are totally C*ck Sucking, F*ckin' great and all...if you are into Sh*t like that...", he finally gives up.  After throwing a few more drinks in his direction, _I_ get the pleasure of driving young Mr. Olson home.  Oh well...at least we got to listen to total horse-sh*t like "My band started playing in a chicken-coop" and "Everyone who wore Reebock sneakers in my high-school was assaulted by a man named Dyke". Lordy.  Of course the oddest thing as well...while we were sitting on my front porch (Trust me, Jimmy was NOT allowed inside unless he had to evacuate his bladder), a young thing comes stumbling down the block. Here name is Laura. She had just moved to Richmond, after living in Pennsylvania. She was thrilled at how cheap it is to live here, and at her brand new mercedes.  She happily took our beer, and gave my roomate some lip. She asked for an escort to a house 1 block away. Keep in mind this is around 2:45 in the morning. She was going to see...get this...a person she met at a CATHOLIC SINGLES night.   I am certain at 2:45 in the morning, after a few drinks in this lady, the fellow she was heading to see was going to do several CATHOLIC things to this young lady...but...as they say..."when in Rome"...  So...long story short. Alcohol helps you meet people you would NEVER want to spend time with otherwise.     Hey, but at least Miss Lane got her two sets of telephone numbers.  ...Of course, she could have probably received dozens if she really tried.  Best,  Brett

      Good afternoon!  So...everything is rolling along. I just ordered another 20 thousand bags and boards for comics! So...c'mon by and help ol' Brett bag out these suckas.  On a side note, There has been VERY little interaction with the blog readers of this site. I have had almost 500 hits in a month, so SOMEONE must be reading it other than Lois and Mikey.  SO... This is the first blog request:  Post _ANY_ response to my blog by leaving a comment to _THIS_ post.   You can say anything you want...but please sign it to this post. I will use it as an informal "guestbook".  Feel free to post anonymously, but be clever if you want. It is fun trying to decipher who said what. I don't even mind fun stuff like "Get out of my head, you F*cker!". Or "quit writing about me...you know I know who you are talking about, F*cker!". Neat!  So...Begin writing/responding....NOW!     on a side note...I really want to see Farenhiet 9/11, but don't have time this weekend. If anyone is fortunate enough to see this guerilla documentary, let us know how it is.  Best,  Brett

      Hmm...This is an interesting one. Right from the Reuters Headlines.  It seems as if an Oklahoma City judge is being accused of masturbating on the bench.  Here is a quote from the article you can find  urlLink here.   >> "'On one occasion, Ms. (Lisa) Foster (Thompson's court reporter for 15 years), saw Judge Thompson holding his penis up and shaving underneath it with a disposable razor while on the bench," the petition reads.    Several witnesses, including jurors in Thompson's court and police officers called to testify in trials, said in the petition they heard the "swooshing" sound of a penis pump during trials and saw the judge slumped in his chair, with his elbows on his knees, working the device. The witnesses said the pump sounded like a blood pressure cuff being pumped up."   So...a long time ago someone said "never mix work and pleasure." Of course if you are in charge of upholding state law, AND you wear a robe, apparently you are allowed to go a bit...er...slouch on the rules.  This is why I have a mostly "stay at home" business.  Personal gratisfaction comes at my discretion. Of course, If I had a pump, it would be even more fun.  So...This is an open call to everyone...if you have a working-condition male-masturbatory product that you would like to donate to my cause, let me know. Work can get awful dull, and who knows when I might start wearing a robe.     On a side note, Lois just took me to see "The Terminal". I give it a C+. Not really a love story, not really terribly exciting, but certainly an interesting take. It is a clever idea, and was probably worked best by Spielberg. In lesser hands it could have easily been a D.  Take care.  Brett

      So,  The entire family went to my Grandma's birthday party, which was hosted by my aunt. This was kind of an impromptu B-day thing, as EVERYONE forgot about the birthday (which was on Sunday), including my Grandfather (her husband).  So...We are invited to attend this gathering. My aunt tells my mother to invite me. When we ask if we are to bring anything, she says 'no' and that everything is going to be cold food, buffet style. Just bring ourselves. We are going to do it simple.  Well... When we show up, there is Baked Chicken, two types of Salads, birthday cake, Hand-pulled crabcakes and loads of fruit. Not exactly simple.  When the meal is finished, my aunt announces that it is time for presents. Presents?!? What in the world?  Well...my Aunt, Uncle, Two cousins, their spouses and kids each give my Grandma a gift. It is like Frickin' Christmas day.   Well... Guess what _my_ parents and myself have to give my Grandmother for her "Simple...just bring yourselves" birthday party? That's right....JACK SQUAT.  So...one half of the family doles out gifts from Goddamn Talbots and such, and my folks and I are sitting there with our thumbs up our asses.  Great fun. Especially since we were the ones to drive my grandmother and grandfather home. She kept thanking us over and over again.  Well...you are welcome....for NOTHING. What a lame deal.  It is always nice to have a token a$shole in the family. I guess my mother, my father and myself make 3.  Ughh.. It is 6:30 AM. I am going to bed.  Happy Frickin' birthday, Grandma.

      Hmm...  seems as if the funnybone has an open-mic night every once in a while. Now... the question remains: do I think I am funny, and do OTHER people think I am funny.  Sure, it is no problem making old Lois Lane laugh. Just drop a fart joke every once in a while, and that girl is in hysterics. Now, if you get her a bit excited, she may even _drop_ a fart joke of her own. Especially when playing Monopoly.  But, regardless...folks seem to think I am a stitch. Several people (well...3) have told me what a hoot this blog is. Well..time to own up. This isn't funny, dammit! This is _my_ life! Is that it?!? Am I here to amuse you?  It would seem so.  Also, much of what I find funny is only because I was dropped on my head as a child.  Honestly, there is nothing funny about the muscle guy running on the tread-mill with his silly 1986 butt-cut hairstyle bouncing around.   Additionally...the sign at the Sheetz restaurant with the guy puking, and the statement "report employee illness" really isn't funny at all. I mean...do you really have to report puking? Isn't it kind of self-explanatory.   Case in point....someone yaks all over some dude's cheese fries. Is it really necessary to say "Are you OK?" I mean, sh!t, the guy puked for crissakes. Better go report it to the manager....we MIGHT have someone sick over here.     Another case in point. I had a good laugh at my roomate the other day. Granted the laugh was AFTER the fact, but it was still funny to me. See...My roomie was out drinking up a storm. We find his barely conscious body in his bed room and rouse him. He demands that we have a drink with him. No problem, so I pour myself Tonic, and him Gin. No...I didn't say I poured a Gin and Tonic...I said I gave him straight alcohol and I gave myself sparkling water. So of course he passes out cold at the table.   So...mister responsible that I am....I leave him at the table and go watch pornograpy. See....NOT FUNNY!  Or is it?  Don't worry...I'll tell you the male masturbator story later...but trust me...It's NOTHING like "the real thing".  Best,  Brett

      Ok...  so...enough bitching about my weight. It is time to end it. So...Lois Lane and myself begin our fantastic diet today. Goal: To look better and feel better by the ol' 26th b-day in mid-september. I have packed on a good 5 pounds in the past month, and I am looking forward to losing it soon.  As is customary, I have put a BEFORE picture that I took last night below:     Wish me luck!  Best,  Brett

If you are gonna suck down the same number of calories that is in a twinkie, at least go full throttle.

This link from one of 'em held my particular interest for about 1/2 hour. I hope it does for you too:   urlLink  Virtual Poker    A splendid site for all of you sadists out there.  you know...sick people who can't keep themselves away from sickness like the  urlLink GoreGasm .

      Hmmm...  Here it is, around 2pm...and I am waking up. So a few quick comments before my daily defecation and shower:  1) Mikey...Thank you kindly....now I can no longer bitch about not having an iPod mini. Of course, I went ahead and dipped into my savings to go on a $100 shopping spree at the ol' CompUSA apple store. Got an armband, with the SKIN, and the MONSTER cig adapter w/decent FM transmitter for the ol Saturn.  2) I REALLY love driving my sniper van around. This POS is a blast on Saturday night when everyone is drunk. My old two-seater Saturn is lovely, but I get the crap scared out of me when I am rolling through the Drunk-Hour-Traffic from 1:40-2:40 in the mornings Fri and Saturday. I really dig sitting up in the van, so I can see around the Fan corners. Keen!  3) I have met two really DUMB people in the last 3 weeks who operate the check-out stands in stores. Now, I do not have any mean-spiritedness towardspeople of below average intelligence. We aren't playing Jeopardy here, folks. All I ask for is a bit of COMMON sense. Now, if I am being too tough on my expectation of people, please respond to this post. believe me, I will take it all worth a grain of salt, but at least SOMEONE will know that I am/am not a primadonna.   ok...First case: I am helping these fine folks RE-build a closet. No worries. These folks make me constantly laugh at either rediculous BS they have been through at far-off schools, or just at how silly the fact is that all I want to do is eat some fried crap at 12:30 in the morning, but some LOUD-AS-SH!T lady is screaming into my ear singing some nonsense like "You've got friends in Low places" or some other forgettable tripe...whoops...off-topic here. Ok...so...I was at the Lowes that popped up in the FAN (?!?!), and picked up a piece of Dry-wall. The lady scans it, and it comes into the computer. Now...guess what the lady...who works at LOWES...asks me:  "Um...what is that?" by this point I am a little dumbstruck. I mean...she works at LOWES and doesnt know what drywall is? so I tell her: "It is a sheet of drywall". Now the next question is even more classic: "Right...Right...Um, What do you use it for?"   "Well...most people use Drywall for building....Walls."  Euthanize me now... please.  ok...Second case: I was at the CompUSA yesterday wasting time and money. I took my dad to see Dodgeball for the ol' fathers day, and it was sold out at the Sh!t pump, so I take him to places _I_ want to go. Lucky him. So he gets to roll down to the Computer store with me. In my constant search for Cellphones, I notice they carry sprint. So...The only person I can find in a red shirt working there is a counter attendant (of which there were about 8 available, and doing nothing). So...I ask her "I see you have a Sprint banner hanging up, can you show me where the cell-phones are?" - "No problem, sir....right this way." Yup....she takes me right over there in a flash....to the CORDLESS WALL-PHONES.  It's a good thing that now, in 2004...people who work at a store with a CELL-PHONE banner outside still have no idea what the contraptions are. If I give you a sledge-hammer, will you please put me out of my misery?  Best,  Brett

      What is it about flatulence that is so funny?  seriously? Belching is quite amusing, but nothing, and I mean NOTHING is funnier than a solidly ripped fart.   Why is that? I have had this conversation with my roomate on a few occassions. He contests that it is funny because it is uncontrollable. An interesting theory...but the SBD is certainly...containable.  Now, there are certainly goodly ripped stinkers that fall into various categories of humor. There is the 'let's drop this one over here, while I walk over there' fart. These are always clever, because the game goes quickly from pinching one's nostrils to one of amateur detective work. "who was it? was it you?...(I hope it wasn't me).  I have found one thing for certain with this variety of SBD. It is _usually_ the oldest person in the room...assuming there are persons above the age of 60. If you want to find someone who simply doesn't care anymore about public emission of gas, it is the old lady in the corner. Trust me.  This, of course, brings us to the next level of flatulence humor. The public place flatulence. I remember the worst case of bad flatulence I had. It was on an airplane. Now...in general, you can cover up a solid one by simply bearing down on the seat. Well..this is what I did...thinking no one would notice. Well...it was a particularly rude smell, and it was on a small plane.  Now...here is what I _really_ didn't take into account. See...when you are a mile up in the air, you cannot bring in fresh air, because it is well below freezing. So...what does an airplane do, in all of it's cleverness? Yep...it recycles the air. Trust me on this one...this fart was so horribly greasy (I am also lactose intolerant), that it took a good 3, maybe 4 passes for it to clear out....oh yeah...EVERYONE smelled it. You should have seen people looking around...everyone blaming everyone else...Well...guess what? It was _ME_! Too bad, f*ckers!   At least farts always smell the least bad to the poor sap who dropped it. A sort of blessing in a foggy disguise.   Now...if you ever want REAL humor....  Try to find the elusive girl-friend fart.  guaranteed laughter for days. Especially if it is in public. HA!!!  Oh well...just got back from the midnight+1 showing of Spidey 2. 4 stars without a doubt. I recommend seing it in the loudest theatre possible.  ...and try not to fart in it.

      Ah...  so I am less than a month from being booted from this beatiful hole I have called a home for the last 9 months. See...we got verbal approval from the ol' landlord that we could extend our lease until the end of September, which is approximately the same time that my new house would be built. Well...about 3 weeks ago, they rescended the extension. Yee-freakin'-HAW!  So...how do I live it up, knowing I will be booted in three weeks with nowhere to live? By scoping the ol' housewarming party photos.   Ah...this reminds me of the time that I went to my buddies' housewarming party down on Main Street. As they live about 1/2 block from the GHETTO...I help them celebrate the ol' move-in by giving them 10 different varieties of 40's and a 6 pack of MD 20/20s.  Well I down three of the 40's and then crack a 4th...AGAINST everyone's wishes. Well...splendid fellow that I am, I swear up and down that I will finish it. Yeah...bullsh!t! I then get it into my head that I wanna go to the bar for margueritas, and leave the 40, 4/5's full on the counter.  Thank goodness my buddies help me live up to my swearing, and keep the opened 40 for me....  for 6 months.  So...at MY housewarming party, my good buddies _kindly_ remind me of my swearage, and...in their earnestness to be my friend, drag the 40 out for me. Well...I have to keep a promise.  So..in this photo, you will see my best buddies Andy and Frankie, and me holding TWO drinks. 1 - part of the 40 I started, 2 - a soda chaser for the swill. It smelled like decaying feet, and was of the flavor of armpit and disease.  Yummy!     well, old house...it's been a blast. I especially liked the fact that there was NO ventalation in the bathroom or basement, and that the ceiling leaked and the top of the basement collapsed when I did laundry. Ah...the fun.  Below is the house before and after that I WILL be moving into around October. What do you think of my paint re-designs?     Best,  Brett

      Boy oh boy!  Two quick points of note on this fine fine day.  The first is that I just read an archived report about a fellow I am to be the best man of next year. Seems that in order to protest some poorly-managed energy measure his school proposed, the boy sat outside, WITHOUT showering. This even went on to include the folks from the Guiness book of records to get him on file as the person who went the longest without a shower. Clever indeed. I hope those folks at the school took notice...and I am glad to see his fiancee got him to change his ways. Yick! I get the rudest crotch-funk after just 1 day without showering. I think this guy went like 600 days. But don't worry Frankie, ol' buddy ol' pal....as your best man, I will INSIST you take a shower at least a month before walking down the aisle.  On another note, I was able to use my beat old laptop for the first time in what seemed like a year or so. It was on loan to my company, and well out of my hands. I used it to hop over to this whack old Southside bar. It is really neat, as it has this great fireplace, stained glass and wainscoating. It also happens to be in a GODDAMN strip mall. WTF?!?!  Well... I got a great recording of this swell jam-band. Glad to see I still have it together. Ughh...  There was one misfortune. See...the old case I used to haul it around in got all funky and rusted in the past year. So...I was researching cases. The one pictured below seemed to be ideal for not looking like a total a$s-hole. What do you think?     -Brett

      Ah...it seems as if my own stupidity has backfired on me...but at least I took a lot of dummies with me.  See...If you go WAAAY down to my previous post a few weeks ago, I am lamenting on how I wanted to see "Farenhiet" 9/11. Clever, Brett...you managed to mis-spell a word. Not the first time, not the last time, but this time, you took a bunch of morons with you.  See....if you go to Yahoo, and type in "Farenhiet 9/11" my page is on the first set of links.  So...I had a few dozen hits yesterday from fellow morons.  In closing....Idiots unite! I gotcha!  Best,  Brett

      Well, kiddies...I am off to my Fifth visit to the annual All Good festival (www.walther-productions.com). It should be a blast.  Well...at least better than the 2002 all good festival. See, April-May festivals sound quite nice in spirit, but the reality is....the weather blows.  At that show, we saw MASSIVE rains, Snow, Sleet, MUD, MUD, MUD, slippery port-a-jons and loads of music.  At the end of the show, there were about 20% of the people that showed up, the rest having bailed for dryer and warmer ground. It is always fun standing outside in 38 degree temperature listening to Keller Williams...but that is just me. Oh, yeah...I think I was the only one who brought a jacket: a lightweight wind-breaker. Sure the weather called for a low of 60 degrees for the weekend...who was I to care?   At least there was plenty of booze and p-t to go around.   Not so at this trip. Ol' Brett has tried his best to clean up his act. Other than a few bottles of cheap red wine that ol' Lois Lane procured, life will be quite a bit more simple.  Hopefully I will remember more of this year's festival. Wish me luck guys!  Oh yeah...here is an old photo of me and the ex at the All good a few years back...may she rot in hell, where she belongs.     Best,  Brett

      Whoops, I forgot to mention the funniest thing about the KK experience mentioned in the previous post. When I went to the counter, the lady before me, who clearly had already packed some donuts into her face, went up to buy some more.   The counter attendant said something like "Ma'am...there is something on your face", to which the lady responded "Whoops, I got some Kreme on my chin".   Sometimes in life you REALLY have to stifle the laughs. Otherwise you will be tossed into the loony-bin, which is exactly where you belong.     Regards,  Brett

      Well...I had the rare occurance today of actually waking up while the sun was out. After the initial shock, I decided that I had a strong desire for one thing:     So...I drove the Brett mobile over to the Kreme to pick up some tasty treats.  Well...What I _didn't_ know was that Y101 was having a promotion. Buy one get one free. So...when I ordered my two donuts, I got two bonus ones. AWESOME!  THinking ahead, I asked for a carry out bag for the two extra donuts.  Well...do you ever do something you REALLY know you shouldn't? Like whack off, when you are already late for an appointment, or simply decide not to shower for a week, because you don't want to waste the time?   Well, I had one of those moments today. See...I really only intended on having 2 donuts. ONLY 2. That is why I got the carry out bag.  Um..yeah...so...that bag went into the garbage at the end of my meal. There wasn't anything to take home with me.  My tummy is going to regret this later.   Well...maybe not as bad as Lois' tummy. It seems she was up all night long with a slippery case of the runs. I am old hat at getting the trots. See...my parents didn't know about things like "Lactose Intolerance". They thought I spent 3 nights a week crapping my brains out in high school because of "nerves". Trust me...NO AMOUNT OF NERVES ARE THAT BAD. I must have spent 10 hours a week with the most unfortunate cases of re-re the world has ever seen.  Take it from me, there are only two ways to pass the time while suffering from the brown waterfalls:  1) beat off 2) imagine yourself ANYWHERE but there  If you want to REALLY suffer tho...I mean like masochistic suffering, try having a loose movement in MY bathroom. First off, it is like 90 degrees and humid, but the best part: NO VENTILATION. Sweet!  So, in closing...Lois, have fun trying to stay up. Word on the street is you only got four hours of sleep because of rectal mucous and gas. Here is what I recommend as a solution:     I am going to clock out for 2 hours. Have a _beautiful_ day!  Regards,  Brett

      I always like digging up old photos of me. Especially when I am thinner. It makes me feel like I am important, and it is always nice seeing me in my younger years. Here are two photos I have had of me in the past 8 months. The only thing is, I did a double take on each of them. The following photos have been UN-EDITED for your pleasure. Enjoy!  First we have this:     me with the beautiful adult actress Aria Giovanni. Golly she is cute. I bet she was really impressed by this:     ...the scabbed over zit that I popped an hour before the photo was taken. Cool!  Now, here is another one...you will have to use your imagination. It is another photo of my housewarming party:     and what have we here?     A horrible beard that looks like a darned Vag!na. Thanks for telling me I looked like a schmuck. Thanks a lot!  So...have a few laughs at my expense. It is now 6:30 at night, and I think I will go to work.  Regards,  Brett

      So, I got myself a new hit counter (the series of numbers at the very bottom of the right column). This thing is supposed to track unique hits, and eliminate all visits from yours truly. It should give a much better representation of how few people genuinely give a sh!t about this blog. I'll be shocked if it ever goes up in value. I knew something was off when the other counter had 547 hits by the time I changed it.   Quit lying to me, numbers!     Regards,  Brett

      So...  I just finished up watching 5 hours of pornos with Lois Lane.   We went to ye ol' movie store. There are several of these around...you just have to hunt for them. They have these insanely old VHS movies in the front. Crap like "Pete's Dragon" and "Cops and Robbersons" or any number of Steve Guttenberg movies. Yep...the store that you would NEVER want to rent from. That is...of course....if you don't step into the "BACK ROOM"!   This is brilliant. The front of the store is a true "front" for all of the delicious mischief that goes on in the back. It is uncanny how you can miss this stuff. Seriously. There is like NO ONE in the whole movie store, but then you go in to the back room, and there are the strangest members of society hanging out (and me, of course).  And of course, no one knows that you are dragging PORN to the front counter, when they give you these silly little black baggies to bring the filth up to the main counter in.   Oh well...see...the "family video store" that we went to had a brilliant "buy two, get two for free", which is great, considering your typical porno flick is like twice the cost of a typical film.  So...we of course end up getting FOUR flicks. The first one was a swell little two-disc set. It is was some sort of science fiction flick with an INCREDIBLE budget. It had legitimate science fiction special effects, which rocks.  The other two were lame, but the last one was interesting. It had something to do with Cleopatra, and Aincient Egypt. This was fun, but the film was so doggone advanced, that you had a choice of FIVE languages... yup...5 languages for the same porno flick.   ...the only problem is, none of the languages was the "true" language of the film. This might not sound like such a bad deal, but imagine how wildly unerotic a porno flick is when the moans don't sync up. Yep, ladies screaming while their mouths are closed and such business. Ugh!   So...four pornnos (one is a two disc set), and way too much free time makes for a sore monkey.  I'll catch up with all of you losers on the flip-side...gotta catch some Z's.  Feel sorry for ol' brett...staying up WAY too late watching garbage with tired ol' Lois Lane.  Oh yeah...if you have had the pleasure of meeting the fair female reporter known as LL, besure to ask her what in the world _this_ picture is for:     Best to each of you putz's,  Brett

      Well...I didn't quite make it to the Spiderman Music Show I wanted to hit up this weekend. It is a real shame. I was looking forward to it, but some bullsh!t came up, and I still had a good time.  So...who is going to the Allgood show this weekend? If you are a true appreciator of music, you will take the weekend off, and all subsequent weekends off to see this stuff. The Allgood show should be one of the best events on the east coast for raw, live music, and it is less than 6 hours away from ol' Richmond-town, so be sure to visit, dammit!  Um...a few things on my mind... ebay has REALLY slowed down this season. People warned me. I just never believed it. I would have thought that all good comic dorks sit on their ass indoors bidding on ebay no matter WHAT season it is. Welp, I was wrong. Poop on a stick! that sucks.  So...I get to run all over the country selling these silly books. Take it from me. NEVER invest in comic books. SERIOUSLY! This is a disposable entertainment medium, folks. Compare it to say....Investing in VHS tapes. Sure, they are fun to watch, but don't drop little Johnny's college fund into them. Ughh....  Hmm...I always scour the internet for the more attractive information to share with the 2 readers of this blog (Lois Lane and myself). Here is one that is not only quite contextually funny, but funny by de facto. If you miss it the first time, re-read it. It is sure to put a twist in your lip:      HAHAHAHA! Now that is rich...doncha think, Lois?  Ok...now here is a great little deal for us who are hooked on  urlLink real dolls  but don't have the scratch to invest in them. See...I was talking about this with the ol' roomie. We wanted to do one of two things:  1) figure out how to buy the real doll in installments. See...really you only need the critical parts at first. Like : Pelvis, Head... Hand (if you are into that sort of thing), or feet (if you are REALLY into that sort of thing)...then you can add to it like a china set until the doll is complete. It works out for us who are on a budget.  2) Now, if you REALLY have a lot of money, I recommend you can go in the opposite direction. I recommend opening up a REAL DOLL rental shop.  What a great deal. The things go for like $5K, but you could rent it at like $250 a night, and the f*ckers could be paid off with 20 rentals (under a month!). It can even be more profitable if you charge a fee for various outfits (schoolgirl, Dom, Marilyn Monroe, etc.), and you can make a bit of cash if the things aren't cleaned up when they are returned. Like..."be kind, rewind".     Have a lovely evening...and remember...I'm looking out for you.  Best,  Brett

      Ooooh Baby!  What an exciting weekend. I am certain many, MANY things will make it's way onto this blog before too long, but until then, here is the short list of new experiences:  1) I slept a full night at the rest stop 2) I took a shower at the truck stop (It was a great deal: Private, cleaned single shower with sink and toilet...soap and fresh towel all for $3!) 3) I met a person who rambles more than me about these silly things known as comic books. 4) I ate cheesecake in a boat 5) I got to Jam with the Digeridoo 6) I got to spend three solid days with the most beatiful person in the world (and I am NOT talking about myself) 7) I got to live my dream of eating Cheeseburgers two days in a row, complimented by a massive burrito, a cheesteak, a good deal of booze, spaghetti and another burrito. Keen!  Thanks to every mook who helped to make it a glorious weekend. Other than the literal "Wake and Bake" in the tent, everything went wonderfully smooth. Even the small amount of sunburn I got doesn't hurt anymore. I hope it becomes a tan (and then I will wake up from the dream).  Thanks Lois, I had a blast. Meeting Mr. Bravo was exceptionally keen. Always nice to greet a kindred spirit (dorky as he may be).  Looking forward to moves, yardsales and September. What a beautiful day!  Best to all,  Brett

      Whew....it _has_ been some time since I have posted to this thing.  &nbsp;  Lesseee....what has been going on recently....  &nbsp;  Mostly I have been psyching myself out over my impending move. I think I mentioned this before, but I really cannot remember. My current landlord lost their control of the house I am renting, because they are complete losers. They told me I could have a lease extension through the end of September. Well...when they lost the contract, I lost my lease extension. W  &nbsp;  What does this mean? That's right! Brett is homeless. Well...kinda.  &nbsp;  I plan on moving back in with the folks until this house of mine is done being built. I went over to it yesterday. It seems like about 1/2 of the walls are framed...so it can be some time. Lois bet me that it won't be done until the first of the year....and she is right about most things.  &nbsp;  So...big plans right now....get the f*ck out. I have a week, so it shouldn't be too bad.  &nbsp;  Of course I get bogged down in the small stuff. Like last night. I looked at my living room for like 5 straight minutes, just overwhelmed by what needed to be done, rather than actually doing it. I hate having 200 things to do. I would much rather do 20 things systematically. Of course 1 thing is easier than all of that.  &nbsp;  Well...not a terribly funny post. If any of you guys find yourself in Richmond this Saturday and want to do unpaid, under-appreciated manual labor helping me to move furniture, please....let me know.&nbsp;  &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  On a few final notes, if it wasn't for my sordid past, I would be all-over this job opportunity. As much as I love comics, I would much rather sqash the hopes and wills of other people on network television. If anyone applies, please get fired for me.  &nbsp;   urlLink http://hotjobs.promotions.yahoo.com/apprentice   &nbsp;  Also, this dude still never ceases to amaze me:  urlLink Will Hung &nbsp;  I cannot believe there is a professionally produced video of him. Sure he has about the best name going (Imagine all of the ladies my son will get when his name is "Will Hung Carreras"), but honestly...when will the world settle down from this craziness? Sure, Miss Kelly Clarkson will have my love child, but the rest of it is pure silliness.  &nbsp;  Regards,  &nbsp;  Brett

      Manomanoman,  It has been quite a bit of fun here in the past week or so. Sorry about all of the hubaloo, but like others, I have found myself without an "at home" internet connection. So...it is not like I really cannot post at work, it is just that I seem more like a slob while all of the other people are working hard, and I am typing away.  Quite a bit has happened here in the past week. I have moved out of my rented house, and back in with the parents. This is swell and dandy...unless you take into the fact that certain familiarities I have grown to love and appreciate have been quickly dashed out of the window. Sure, I still find time to waste with a certain so-and-so, but it is a hushed operation, and generally ends long before the clock strikes midnight (usually when the operations would START up).   It was a pleasure seeing one of my best buddies last night. We went to this place (on my recommendation) down the block from where I work. It was written up as being one of the most vegan friendly dives in town. Well...This certainly is NOT for the granola-crunching type. We ordered an appetizer and water, and quickly made a jet-set for the door. $20 for a meat-less entre? What the G*ddamn F*ck?!? ... so we went to the Thai place around the corner. This was quite entertaining. I love Thai restaurants, because their menus are a hoot. Like the one entre "Thai Prik King". Awesome.  They should have named the appetizer that. I ate like three ass-thin slices of beef, and they were so spicy my balls were sweating up a storm. Yummy!  My filthy cat is finally adjusting to the miserable fact that she only has two rooms to live in. She still walks all over my comics, but I learned a long time ago that almost any thing published in the last 25 years is worthless, and not to get the ol' tighty-whiteys in a bunch.   I did have a bit of a windfall come to me recently in business. I sold a book from my personal collection at internet auction for $36,750. Yes....a single book. The only problem is, I bought the thing back when I was young, stupid and thought  I had money. Now I am older, tired and broke as Sh*t. After all of the fees, I actuall ended up LOSING a few hundred dollars on the thing. The good thing is it pays off a majority of my bills, but the lousy thing is, I am STILL left back at square-nothing. Oh, well...such is life. It is as if I am some form of Plastic-man...I keep bouncing back.  On another note...I have seen a few movies recently. Here is my quick take:  (out of four stars)  The Princess Bride : **** Incredible  The Bourne Supremacy: **1/2  A decent crash and ride story...but got convoluted quickly. Ignore the plot, and just watch the too-cute-for-being-a-super-spy Damon get the crap kicked out of him, and still be washed clean with a bit of soap.  Anchorman - legend of Ron Burgandy: *  Total insipid tripe. Waste of money. The only regret I have more about paying for this film is paying for my date as well. Ughh!  Dodgeball: *** A great film...think Zoolander meets Old-school. Laugh out loud.   Spiderman 2: **** Perfect in every way. I don't mean to toot the old comic book horn, but it was a brilliant picture. the best of the summer. Trust me.  I am off to see Vinnie and Kumar go to White Castle. Kind of funny for two reasons:  1: I will be going sober 2: There was a kid named "Vinnie Kumar" in our high school. He was a twitchy dude to say the least.  Best to each of you...especially those about to move residences. Keen!  -Brett

      Finally...a job opening!  I should never have hassled my "better half" about her potential job opportunities. Here I was fretting about her moving a mere 80 miles away.  Unfortunately for her, I will be taking up an esteemed position across the ocean. Sorry babe.  From the Reuters:  >> LONDON (Reuters) - WANTED - A court jester to fill a post vacant for 350 years since England executed its king.  English Heritage said in an advertisement in the Times on Thursday applicants for the competition at the weekend should bring their own costumes with bells, but said it would provide a bladder on a stick -- a traditional jester's prop.  ... Would-be fools should attend a public audition Saturday at Stoneleigh Park in central England, wearing their costumes.   The worst part of all of this...I cannot bring my own stick-and-bladder. How in the world am I to be a great fool if I cannot weild my bladder-on-a-stick? How do I know the provided bladder will fill my jesting needs?  Well...these are concerns for later. Now I just have to arrange the flight. Gotta sew those extra bells on too.  Happy days. I am going to Salem tomorrow evening. Should be fun.  Best,  Brett

I cannot even begin to tell you how lucky I am.  With sincerest happiness,  Brett

      Hmm...Interesting story in the news today. No...I am not talking about Tom Ridge, I am talking about this bit of info from the ol' Reuters:  >> LONDON (Reuters) - A police sniffer dog died of a suspected overdose while out hunting for drugs, British police said on Monday.   Todd, a 7-year-old Springer spaniel, had been looking for drugs in a field and car in Preston, northern England, when his handler noticed he was looking unwell.   He was taken to a vet and then rushed to an animal intensive care unit at Liverpool University, displaying symptoms of ingesting amphetamines, a Lancashire police spokeswoman said.    See...That is the problem with amphetamines...You have to ingest the things. Now...I wonder if the cop would have noticed anything had the dog say...eaten a bag of marijuana. Could you imagine that? What would the cop do? you know like..."Todd was fine, until he ate all of the food in his bowl, AND the cat's bowl, and then zoned out to infomercials for about 5 hours." Or something like "Todd chased his tail for 2 hours, and then took a nap for the rest of the day". Hmm...really ODD behaviour for a dog.   Speaking of odd behaviour...  There is a human out there that has been a real thorn in my side for sometime. Not really kryptonite to my superman, but more like...a head cold to Lois Lane. I go through every motion possible to include this person in activities, and I really do think they actively seek to hurt me. Right now the best thing for me to do is back the hell off. Now is the time for level-headed understanding on my part.  When I over-react, I make people I care about cry. Everytime I turn around, I feel like I am facing depression head on, and SOMEHOW manage to stave it off another few weeks. If I have the energy and the power, I beg the powers-that-be to allow me peace and solace for a mere 4 weeks. I need it...heaven knows I need it. The burdens become too much sometimes. Lean on me, and I will do my best to lean on you. I am the type of person you HAVE to pressure information out of...otherwise I will be the catty-est MF in the world.  I apologize.  ...To everyone.  Especially Todd, the drug-ingesting dog.  Love,  Brett
