       What a fun contradiction! Back at each others' throats so soon .Throwing Mammeo in my face again . I need G.S. like I need that extra testicle I always wanted . S. is  danger  and that excites me.  It is very important that I sit back , detach as much as possible and watch .What happens ,how S. acts in likely situations and reacts. The "what ifs" are there... Jacob got out  twice since her return . Not too far . Caught and returned by a neighbor . When I hear a bark or whine ,  I act . Check out the situation .That could mean danger , it could mean trouble . It could mean the mail was delivered... I don't  have to  answer the phone . If it is important to the caller they can leave a message .That's what caller i.d. is for...  Now that S. is back to her usual self... emotional rollercoaster , drinking wine  all  day looking for and finding someone/anyone to blame I can distance myself . She played the same game with Hal earlier . " Get the phone , it's probably for you ". I said if you can't speak up or don't have anything to say , don't call . All I heard was unintelligible mumbling . Then S. took the phone , said it was MR. Rappaport , called him back and was  mean  to him . For caring enough to see if she had returned safely .  Obviously things had not gone great with them . There's G.S. Ready to intervene , rescue her  baby  and defend her from this cold , cruel world . Find someone who can deal with that sort of emotional trauma . Happy with being both G.S .and S's. garbage dump . It is a package .  I cried from relief .At first thinking I was falling into a profound depression . Coming quickly around , I realize that I no longer have any obligation to S. I 'll be her friend , but I won't lose myself to her drama . Nor accept her terms as condition of my existence . I won't be that miserable anymore .  I may never find the person who 'completes' me , makes me happy .Which is not going to be found externally. That person never left - I was me all along .

       When I see her . Not that I expect her to return . She "played" me , hope she's pleased. Susan is the type of person who thinks only of herself. She drank my Doppelbock and didn't replace it , nor offer to buy me another . She  will  call . When she  needs  something . I'd say she's  acting  like a spoiled child , but it's  no act  ! My kindness is lost on her . She shows no gratitude .  Now I need a  vacation  from all the fur and stupid dogs !

       Far from lonely . Always something to do with critters and share food with them . A new friend asked me to come hear her sing/jam again . All that held me here was dog loyalty and  cheap  beer.  Jacob  wasted  the hose I foolishly left next to his water bowls...Who else could I blame ? The  likely  suspect ...other dogs too laidback to be  that  destructive.  Got paid early .Check dated tomorrow , 5/28 . Cashed anyway - desperate. Must fill up gastank in Jeep if I hope to go to "El" tomorrow and p/u Susy Sat. late .Appt. on S. First tom. at 11 a.m. tom. also.  Liz S. wants to 'talk' . I feel a sharp , distinct foreboding...She could be good for me ? Only in dark ,only in  deep  dark . And she has come a long way , compared to where she was . I'm not desperate - my Left Hand .   Rain came in at 9:50 p.m. Had a feeling it would .Off to West , two co's. away 2 hours ago . Wind was gusting up to 30 mph at that time ... Would be good to finish back fence before leaving and let Jacob have run of yard all day. But I do not trust him . At all .

       I had to call Mistress of Hounds . Seeking reassurance that I was doing the best I can and giving these mutts all the love they deserve . The 3 'youngsters ' were discards , emotionially and likely physically abused. Certain they live with the dog -version of P.T.S.D. That's my armchair dog psychology for tonight .  Limitations placed on me I cannot accept...other people projecting their fears and insecurities onto me . The worn out , unproven thinking that one  must  "hit bottom" before things turn around and get better .  Everyone  needs to be hospitalized every now and then. If they have mental health concerns .  Every day , I need a challenge . Physical and/or mental. My lifeforce demands that I learn something and always work toward the positive. Five years ago I never would have dreamt that I would be using p.c.s as much as I do . Certainly not working as an instructor .Most of what I have learned has been self-taught . Through trial and error. As it was for Thomas Paine , Abe Lincoln , Thomas Edison and Luther Burbank . In moments of clarity , I recite W. Churchills' Battle of Britian speech . Then proceed to "seek a fresh grip on my bullet-proof mask " because I do hide behind " Paranoid Eyes " .  Cauition : Do  not  slip into espanol around Susys' mother figure.It intimidates the carpetbaggers come lately .Like I always say - F.U. if you can't take a joke .BASTA.  I am pleased with the progress I have made . That I have 'outed' myself as a  heterosexual . I can have friends for  who  they are and not for  what  they are labelled. Some are social outcasts , as I consider myself . For levity , I chant Hookers ,Junkies and Queers Oh My to the cadence of Lions ,Tigers and Bears Oh My from  "The Wizard of Oz " ... My personal ' blow off ' tag - Pog m'hone .Irish for Kiss My Ass. Are you reading any of this Geraldine ? Two "Squirtys" in one household .Who could imagine? Not me.

       Jacob went over the back fence again .Found the swimming pool.I was only gone 20 miutes on foot. Upon my return , my intuition told me to call roll. " Is this your dog " ? Always fun capturing Jacob... Now we climb/jump fences. Score: 2/2 .  Wild Boy goes on the chain when I go to work .Let him howl.

       Was the way Mark Twain said it over a century ago . Dogs , plants  and an alleged girlriend who seeks to run away . To a wonderful East coast . If that seems familiar , it is . Linda Sue did as much , the same thing to  Virginia Beach . There is nothing to be compared to the outpouring of rage of a MANIC woman .Quite out of control.  Which says so much about Susan...Dog hoarder. Not a 'safe' situation . I feel better alone . One hot meal per day minus the dogs .   Forget the JEEP...I ride the bus for FREE .  Hungry 90% of the time since I've  become Vegetarian . Still eat eggs and milk products .The thought of dead flesh repulses me .Fish , fowl ,pork or beef seemed to sit in my gut ...Now I eat less and feel better for it .  I refuse to trim my mustache , as it is me .  OOOOPPPPSSSS....

       Acting in that capacity , I will be emphatic in stating that I would wish JACOB on noone . He is not a pet , he is a monster .  Susan left at the start of molting season....these dogs , except Jacob ,don't shed.They molt . I could vacuum thoroughly daily and there would still be clumps of fur all over. It seems such a futile situation esp. since Susy doesn't bother to call and ask how things are going .Where is my money for yardwork?  I will gladly give this up for a life of solitude again , to go roving ...

       I was going to take Jacob to El Jardin and let him enjoy a change of environment. Better than being chained in my absence. He was leashed through the top of back door. I parked in front to get something in front yard , looked over and he was gone. Headed toward Balcones.   A foot chase was futile... Caught up with him at the Bap't. church. He likes it there and they like him too . Figures he can get sanctuary? So , I cornered him and held him tight when I heard , " Don't be MEAN to that dog " . I said ,lady  you didn't have to CHASE him . That is I took him down . Didn't beat him there.   Jacob went on the chain in bkyd. and I went to El Jardin .H2Oed and weeded a little .Talked to a cute girl , asked her if she wanted to use my rose .Which she had no idea of. So , She watered wrong. As  I live , I water as intensely as my bed are full .  First squash...not a male flower. Mucho green tomatoes and cream peas are vining . Everything sprawls.Hard to believe  that I'll be out of here in 8 days .

      the way that circumstances go ?  " Dumbass " , a.k.a Jacob climbed backyard fence .Wire on top bent down. I heard , was alerted to the high pitch of his eunuch - hound  howl. Fortune prevailed ,he waited next to the fence. Grabbing a good handful of skin along Jacob's spine ,I simply  lifted him over . I understood how the loose skin was practical for fighting and now another use for it . Did he get a good talking to ,down to ?  Almost 3 weeks with no escapes - three days shy. Spraypaint in dayglo/safety orange SKP on his sides ?  He will go on chain and I will put in a full days' work outside of here. Hardware cloth and cableties are my means to the end of escapes. I am the master of these hounds . A position accepted through a friendship . Glad when I can relinquish it.  The "owner of record" extended her vacation two weeks , left me with no compensation or consideration in kind .Which is the way spoiled brats are .

       Dear Mrs. Rappappaport,      Your dogs are fine . It is me who longs for HUMAN companionship. I keep up with them.Fresh food and water,that is why I named this what I did . Should you ever read this , try to understand my needs . I will NOT be your emotional garbage dump . Find another fool , cause I see beyond these walls in front of me all too soon I get my kit and SPLIT .

       I'm somewhat sad....The mistress of hounds won't be back until the 29th -late. Now she's in hospital in Md. Doesn't know what is wrong. I'm waiting to hear what her dx. is . I'll carry on ,keep her house and dogs the best I can.

       Found out this morning that I have a 13 day extension here at casa de Shawdogs.This information was not divulged freely , but through my instigation,Grasshopper , Tomato ,Fieldlilly ,Mrs. Rappaport if you ever read this ,I feel betrayed and screwed .I got my Alexander Haig act down. I am in charge here. Do I get paid for the work I do here ? For my money spent  on the pack ? That remains to be seen as to how parsimonious the Shaw ma and da are. After all ,they are Christians.... I'm proud to be an Infidel.  It simply doesn't set right with me . That a 44 y.o. mujer gave power of attorney to her elderly , adopted parents. The 'girl' has the emotional maturity of a 14 y.o. Far too unstable , with violent mood swings . I've been there . I know that Prozac doesn't work forever and can make one aggressive.  I'm getting out in the world . Other scenes - my jardin. An actual 'pet' dog to visit. Quite a cutie.Five pounds of pure fun.
