       Umm Michael, what exactly is a Michaelism, and whats up with this blogger?   Simply put the Michaelmiester will explain all there is to know about Michaelisms and this blogger. First a Michaelism is a thought, concept or belief that may or may not be ficticious in nature. It may trip with irony, you might even find a bit of humor behind it, but utmost of importance is that it provide a little insight, knowledge and comfort. I'll give you a good example of a Michaelism.  People in life use this old cliche: When life throws you lemons make lemonaide.  Here is a Michaelism: When life throws lemons at you, break out the barcardi!!   Now another thing you will find on this website, is my own personal jabber about anything I feel like jabbering about it might be interesting jabber it might be boring jabber if you don't like reading it you can click and go on to the next blog, if you do like reading it by all means you can make a comment and or even request to be added to the jabber team so that you can jabber along with me.   I may add some poetry from time to time, and those of you who have ever read my blog's in the past may remember me attempting to do a horoscope once a week in the past I may do something like that again, the horoscope was very time consuming so I'm not sure whether or not I will actually pull this one off or not but I will certainly attempt to do some zany, wacko things here.

       May 19, 2004 - Discharged From Broward General Medical Ctr             I am starting this journal so that one day I might be able to make sense, so that some day I can maybe make peace with this disease, so that some day others might find courage in knowing that someone else has walked in their footsteps, and as a sources and means for my own sanity.  I was diagnosed HIV +, I had been tested a few different times in the past and always it provided me the comfort of being negative but not this last time. It all started with me getting an infection around the outside of my eyelids, I was given a good dosage of antibiotics. Shortly after this, my ears became infected and a rash developed around my mouth, then a rash under my armpit. I went to the hospital and the symptoms would almost disappear but then they would re-occur it started in Aug 2003, and it wasn't until May 2004 that I was actually diagnosed. I was admitted namely because my platelet level was dangerously low, according to the medical staff was partly the cause of the infections not healing. It totally made sense, of course now to find out why the platelet levels were so low. Of course they wanted to rule out everything from lupus to leukemia, some of those test I'm still awaiting the results of, in the interim I was asked when my last HIV test was taken, or if I had ever been test, I did confirm that I had been tested a number of years ago, and that I didn't feel at risk as those tests were negative and taken after I had been with my last partner, and I hadn't been with anyone since.  But to my surprise my test revealed that I was infected with the HIV antibodies. Now I'm awaiting more information, awaiting social services and government assistance and wondering why. I am not really sure exactly what will become of this, there is a number of directions it could go. At the very least if I can gain something it's wonderful, and then it even becomes greater if someone else besides me benefits.   I guess it's all a matter of how you look at it that counts, is the glass half empty or half full? - Some view being positive as a death sentence and others are able to embrace it and accept it. I was told now-a-days HIV was like diabetes that patients are living years and years with the disease, so exactly how do you embrace and accept death when faced with it? Unless you make peace with the disease and accept, and embrace it the disease is simply going to eat away at you quicker, because of this it's essential that you not run away and face the light that shines ahead, for me the way I try to look at it. I should quickly learn and evaluate what is important in my life, what I appreciate in life, and even more on the other hand, what is it that I need to do in my life.    June 02, 2004 - My First Clinical         My Day began with my landlord (Duane) knocking on my door to discuss an issue about another tenant that lives on the property where I currently reside, I took the opportunity to inform my landlord that tomorrow June 3, 2004 when my rent was due that I wasn't going to be able to pay him my rent and explained to him that I had been diagnosed being HIV positive, he explained to me that his partner (Charlie) has been positive for 20 plus years and told me that although this disease could be terminal how it will change my life, how it will make my life different, and how many avenues would be open to me now.  When being newly diagnosed with HIV it kind of opens the doors for all kinds of benefits and assistance with your living and well-being but the system is set up as such that Nobody will talk to you until you have a Case Manager. So on June 02, 2004 I had my first appointment with Comprehensive Care Center off of Broward Blvd and 11th Avenue in Ft Lauderdale, Florida it was quite the ordeal. First my morning had started with the Medicaid social worker calling advising me that I need to come into the hospital so that I can submit an application for Medicaid & Food Stamps. I inquired with her about seeing a Case Manager and when I would see the Case Manager, she stated that she really wasn't sure. I had a gut instinct and feeling that I would meet and see the Case Manager at the clinic. The thing about applying for any assistance you must be linked to the resource, program by a Case Manager. I asked the Medicaid worker if I'd be meeting my Case Manager she stated, no, so I called the clinic I was told that my first visit with them as an Intake, and would be to see a Financial Counselor and then immediately following that I'd see the Case Manager. I was approximately about 10 minutes early for my 2pm appointment with the clinic. I signed paperwork and continued to wait. Finally after waiting for almost 2 hours and knowing the clinic closed at 4:30 I asked the receptionist if they were ever going to call me. She said, they haven't called you yet... I was sitting in front of her the entire time, and she went into the back. Immediately following that the financial counselor called me I wasn't impressed with the idiot at all. She continued to call me by an incorrect last name continually over and over again, she was loud, and obnoxious and just slightly rude. At the end of her paperwork she said let me see if I can't get the Case Manager to talk to you, when she did get a hold of the case manager, she stated that the case manager was leaving and 5 minutes and that I'd have to come back. I was enraged by this action, especially being as my need is somewhat urgent. Finally another Case Manager had agreed to see me.      Helen Stolin who is remarkable, and wonderful stated to me that she would from this point on be my Case Manager from this point and had explained that she no longer does intake but she is the Case Manager that usually get transferred the emergency cases or people who really are in need. She gave me a couple of different places I could go and receive immediate food.  urlLink Poverello , as well as a Church, she gave me information about  urlLink Housing Opportunities for Persons With Aids (HOPWA) ., She also informed me to go to Mount Olive Development Corp and stated they would provide assistance to persons who needed help with rental payments who were HIV+, she stated that there was a 6 month waiting period but to go ahead and apply because many times she has seen cases where people think they won't be in a position and 6 months later they are still in the same situation.   At the end of the day I called my landlord and spoke with Charlie explaining that I needed to discuss some things with Duane upon returning my call we got together and I explained the information that I had found out about  urlLink HOPWA . Duane said that he wanted to read the documents over and that he would decide whether or not he wanted me to pursue this avenue of assistance that was available to me.    June 3, 2004 - Assistance Starts To Begin.          My morning again began early about 9am which for the average bird isn't early but considering the fact that I've not been able to sleep well at night, considering the fact that over the last 24 hours I had only had about 2.5 hours worth of sleep, and I didn't fall asleep until about 5am, it is amazing that I was up and awake at 8:30 in the morning. I was however, aware that today was a very important day for me, Patti arrived at my house at approximately 10:15am. I gathered all the information I needed for the Medicaid & Food Stamp applications and then called Brad at  urlLink Poverello , I informed him that Helen had referred me to the food club and she was asking if they could set up with an emergency basket of food. He told me show up any day this week between 10am and 1pm and he would set me up with an emergency basket of food.   I was at the hospital's corporate office at approximately about 10:45am to meet Ms Roberta Dalhouse so that I could apply for the Medicaid & Food Stamps however she was unable to assist me stating it was a busy morning however she immediately got another worker within her office to take my information and fill out the forms and applications needed for both the Medicaid & Food Stamps. The process was rather quick considering the amount of paperwork that was needed and considering the fact that Ms Dalhouse had the case load that she had that morning. I was out of there by 11:30am, I called Patti to let her know I was done and needed to be picked up, standing outside of the hospital I ran in Tari Johnson from Humana Biscayne a former co-worker and she told me that her mom Betty Johnson was working in the admissions office there at Broward General. Patti picked me up about 12:10pm and we were off and on our way to  urlLink Poverello . I saw Brad he explained that he was going to set me up with an emergency box of food, and explained the way the food club worked. I have another appointment with Alex for the intake at the food club on June 9th at 2pm then I will be able to go to  urlLink Poverello  once a week to pick up a basket of food. Jason tells me that you can choose to pick up food weekly or monthly. But I wasn't given that option. Maybe Alex will give me that option when I talk to him. I'm not sure. I was really surprised at the amount of food they give you. They gave me 3 pieces of chicken, 2 hamburgers, 2 pork chops, carrots, potatoes, onions, 3 cans of soup, a can of tuna fish, toilet paper, bread, grits, eggs, milk, isotonic drinks (cranberry, lemon-aide, fruit blast) dried black beans, rice, macaroni and cheese, blueberry muffins, cinnamon snack cakes, 2 oranges, 2 bananas, 2 apples, and there are probably a few items that I'm missing or forgetting to mention, but whatever the case is they made sure that I will be fed this week. Patti, Jason & I hung out over at Patti's house, and when Cathy got home we ordered Pizza from Dominos. Patti & Cathy took us both to the Indian Reservation to pick up cartons of cigarettes. I arrived home at 10:10pm and called my Duane to make arrangements to pay him some of the rent what Jason & I both could afford to throw him. Jason paid $500.00 dollars, and I gave $80.00 towards my rent, total $580.00 and to my surprise Duane had filled out the forms for  urlLink HOPWA , which I will be submitting tomorrow.    June 4, 2004 - Nothing to Worry About???       I woke up later than I had originally planned to this morning not getting out of bed until about 10:30am. I called the information I had found online for the local  urlLink HOPWA  administrator, and was informed that Duane was correct in stating that I did not need the 3 day notice, however Duane had omitted his signature on the W9 form that is required. I attempted to call Helen to inform her of what Michael had told me about not needing the 3 day notice, and to find out if I could possibly just fax over the information to her, and however she didn't return my call.  Then about 12:45pm Rose-Marie called from the clinic, she stated that my lab work had come back and she was concerned and wanted to know if I had ever had any bleeding problems? I informed her that platelet level at the hospital was dangerously low and she asked what my platelet level was at while I was in the hospital, which was 28,000, when I asked her what my level was at she responded it's gone down to 14,000. Which according to the doctors I had at the hospital is a sign that either someone is possibly bleeding internally or at the risk of having a brain aneurysm. Now I'm extremely curious as to what the results of my Bone Marrow Biopsy will be when I get it on Tuesday June 8th from The Cancer Center at the hospital. I will tell you know that I'm not going to be doing too well if on top of the HIV it is determined that I have leukemia. So now I have the weekend to be worried, and concerned. I asked Rose-Marie if I was going to be okay and she said, you'll be okay if you cut yourself and/or start bleeding go to the hospital, and she was going to see if there was anyway I could get in to see the Dr Sharma prior to June 10. I communicated with Duane what information I had found out about  urlLink HOPWA  today, and informed him that I would be submitting the paperwork to them as of Monday    June 6, 2004 - A New Week       This is the beginning of the a new week, and there is a lot to look forward too, first up on Monday I need to get in touch with Helen Stolin and submit the paperwork for  urlLink HOPWA , so that they might be able to provide me with some assistance as far as my rent goes. Also up on Monday I want to go ahead and being as I'm going to be going into the clinic I want to contact Rose-Marie and see if I should plan on trying to come in to see the doctor because of my platelet levels. I spent a good portion of Friday night out with some friends, and then came home from I-hop and started doing some research. One of the links I've included on my website, are links to  urlLink Project Inform , I found this site to be very informative with information about the types of lab work that is done with HIV cases, what to come to expect, and how to read and interpret T-cell count and Viral load counts I'm still interested in finding out what these figures are at, currently. I've told some friends of mine that it is a big desire for me to get everything for my care coordinated so that I can focus my time volunteering and helping others out who are newly diagnosed. Being positive I want to make sure that I treat this thing positively and the only way to do that is to live with it each and every day If I can influence someone who is infected to be tested so their disease is caught in early stages, or if I can be the one who inspires someone to stop and think before putting themselves at risk then there will be purpose and value added to my existence on this earthly level. I must by morning formulate a work plan to show  urlLink HOPWA  that I am working towards being self-sufficient.&nbsp; So I must work on that a little before bed, it's already 2:46am. I have tentative appoints on Tuesday with the Oncologist who did the bone marrow biopsy, Wednesday with intake office at  urlLink Poverello  food club and Thursday with Dr Sharma and Helen Stolin.&nbsp; Also I hope to hear from Department of Children and Family Services (DCF) in reference to my Food Stamp Application, and my Medicaid Application. Hopefully these are benefits which will be prompt with their findings so that I can coordinate the type of care I wish to receive outside of the hospital district, and can take advantage of other services such as Life-Line which will lower my Telephone Plan or Assistance with my electricity bill,and things of that nature. Of course I'll keep you posted on my day-to-day ups and downs. Also I will more than likely be following up with the Social Security Office to find out if there has been any determination made about possibly finding my claim to be Presumably Disabled. This is another thing I need to be discussing with Dr Sharma or whoever I choose to be my primary doctor. I'm really unclear as to whether or not I'm going to stick with the doctors at the hospital clinic although I would love to be treated by Dr Faureau, which is the MD I had while I was hospitalized I seriously doubt that she is in practice for herself. I did however notice that she was at the clinic during my last appointment, so if I get the chance or opportunity to follow up with her at some point I would be very open to that idea    June 7, 2004 - Paperwork Submitted        This morning started early as a matter of fact last night I had yet another sleepless night after going over everything again and again I drafted a letter to be included with my application to  urlLink HOPWA , this morning first thing at 8am I was on the phone attempting to call the nurse about my platelet counts and calling Helen about the paperwork she needed. Finally after reaching Rose Marie I was able to get a hold of Helen about 9:15am she advised me to come in at 2:30pm, after getting a hold of Helen I then touched base with Rose Marie and let her know that I was going to be coming into the clinic at 2:30 she informed me that she had spoken with Dr Sharma and the doctor had stated that I could wait until my scheduled appointment on Thursday. So in the morning I have the appointment with The Cancer Center at the hospital because of my platelet levels I've been a little bit concerned about that, but my hopes remain high that the bone marrow is going to come back with good results. At the very least those are my hopes, I'll obviously know more and write more tomorrow. After going and meeting with Helen I came home and went to sleep, and slept for the majority of the evening. Now it's approximately 2am and I'll be attempting to sleep tonight. So that I can have a productive day tomorrow. Helen said that she'd be submitted the application today and that she would touch base with me tomorrow. Her hopes honestly didn't seem all that promising however it's worth a shot I have nothing to loose and everything to gain. I am hoping that I can receive some assistance if not I will be going insane on this end. For now I am going to try and get some rest and I'll be writing more tomorrow after Dr Taub's appointment at the Cancer Center over at Broward General Medical Center.     June 8, 2004 - Bone Marrow Biopsy       I got the results of my Bone Marrow Biopsy and everything appears to be normal though they are still curious why my platelet levels are down as of the CBC done this morning my count was at approximately 6000 so we are even lower than on June 2, 2004. The term used to describe a low platelet count is Thrombocytopenia. They wanted me to come in to have IGIV and originally I was going to make that appointment for Friday until I realized that I was taking Patti & Cathy to the airport on Friday. So I made the appointment for the treatment for Wednesday of next week. I was told to expect the IV treatment to take about 6 to 7 hours, and to eat something prior to coming in and also bring in food as food wasn't supplied there. Today has just been a slightly okay day I checked in with Helen from Comprehensive but wasn't able to reach her, I left a message for her to return my call. We shall see if she does or not. I'm still in moderate pain but I am under the assumption that is going to be the case for awhile.    June 9, 2004 - Intake At Poverello Food Club    Well I met Cathy for lunch, we went to Skyline Chili off of Federal Highway just right outside Wilton Manors, I had a Jumbo 5 way which was really out of this world. I really enjoyed it afterwards I dropped Cathy back off at work, and continued on my way to  urlLink Poverello  for my intake appointment with Alex. I was a little worried about possibly being a few minutes late but as it turned out it really didn't matter much as when I arrived Alex had someone in his office already and I ended up having to wait until approximately 2:30pm until he was done, when Alex walked out of his office. I immediately recognized his face, at first I couldn't place where I had known him from but I knew that I had dealt with him, someplace in my past. Shortly into the intake interview with Alex it came to me where I had known him from, and I asked him, "You don't remember me, do you?" his reply was "yes, but I don't remember from where". Then I said, I trained you and you worked for me at Direct Mail Center and he was totally shocked we talked a bit about the past, and he revealed that he had been positive for 17 years, again a reassurance that HIV is no longer a death sentence. He explained the food club in better detail than Brad had done, he also told me that they have a gym located across the street that I could use for free, and they have a fitness instructor in the gym and the nutritionist Lee would be glad to set me up with that information. In addition Alex informed me that everyone gets a 10 dollar voucher for the thrift store next door for clothing items only. He gave me my voucher and told me that if i ever needed anything additional they will try to provide me with whatever I need to just let them know, and they can't guarentee it, but they will attempt to get me what I need. With that I picked up my food basket and was going to go next door and look through the thrift shop however I was exhausted and wanted to go ahead and get home so I figured I'd wait and visit the thrift store the following week.    June 10, 2004 - Finally Meeting Dr Sharma.    Finally my first appointment with the Doctor, I felt a relatively good vibe from Dr Sharma however the news he gave me wasn't the greatest news in the world. My CD4 or T Cell count was 111, and my viral load is over 750,000, these are not good numbers at all. According to the  urlLink Centers for Disease Control  therapy for HIV should begin anytime the CD4 count is under 350 or the viral load is over 100,000 as with those counts you are in jeopardy of developing OI's (Opportunistic Infections). Some examples of OI's include Bactrial Pnuemonia, Toxoplasmosis, Herpes just to name a few diseases that I've learned that I'm in jeopardy of developing now. In addition to finding out this information there are several refferals they are setting up through the center, they want me to see a cardiologist, an optamologist, a dermatologist, a pharmacologist, I informed Dr Sharma about the findings at the Cancer Center and fact that I had been scheduled for the IGIV on June 16. Dr Sharma asked if I was going to be getting the IGIV once a month? I told him that as far as I knew they only wanted me to in for the one treatment. He gave me Kaletra, Viread, Epivir, and Bactrim, those are the medications specifically for the HIV, he advised me to get them filled but not to start taking them until I met with the pharmacologist. In addition, he gave me percoset, flagyl, cipro, lexapro, trazadone, and prenatal vitamins.   I immediately went to the health department to get the prescriptions filled, again more red tape. I needed to take all the documents I had previously given to them 100 times over just to be approved to get my medications, I arrived at the health department at 3:15pm and they informed me that I wouldn't be able to get them as I need to be there prior to 3:30pm. It was only 3:15pm the pharmacy tech says "well it takes about 45 mins to process the paperwork. Of course I raised hell and she gave me the information to take over to the intake office to be certified, I immediately ran over and it only took about 10 mins for them to process the paperwork and then again I was off to the pharmacy area at the health department 30 mins later I had all the medications with the exceptions of the Percoset, they wouldn't dispense that but I was informed to go over to Broward General and they would fill that prescription for me, in addition they wouldn't dispense lexapro they called Dr Sharma to find out if he would like to prescribe me something different then lexapro, he stated that he wanted to wait until I saw the Psychiatrist. I was alarmed as I only had 5 lexapro left, and I wasn't due to the psychiatrist until June 29. From the health department I headed over to the Broward General and they filled the percoset script for me within a matter of about 10 mins.    June 11, 2004 - A Day Off At The Airport    Well finally a day off without an appointment, it is nice to be able to relax for a day. I had to take Patti & Cathy to the airport at 12:30 this afternoon, they are flying out to California to see Patti's mother and her brother, and Cathy has made arrangements to visit her Niece and Nephew, Cory and Sarah, and to see Sam (her other brother) and her other Nephew Jared. They have a really long flight because even though I took them to the airport at 12:30 they aren't getting into California until about 10:30pm pst. In the meantime I have the use of Cathy's car and in return I am going to be making sure their cat (Furby), and dog (cokie) are taken care of. I will very possibly just end up spending the time over at their place, however I may travel back and forth I haven't yet decided. I could also pack up the animals and take them back to my place, but it's easier to keep the animals in their own house as opposed to packing them up and taking them back to my place. I will be picking them up from the airport on June 17, and then on the June 18 or June 19 they will be taking off to go visit Patti's Daughter in Arkansas. The bad thing about that is that right now Patti's car is broken down and they will be driving to Arkansas which means that unless they rent a car (which they aren't planning on doing to my knowledge) I will be without transportation while they are gone to Arkansas.    June 14, 2004 - A Day with the Psycologist    This morning at 10:00am I had my first appointment with the Psycologist whose name is Betz Davies, the appointment seemed to go rather quickly she asked me so many questions and things seemed to go rather quickly she explained to me that she was a part of Broward House and comes to Comprehensive only on Monday mornings to provide counseling to the patients at Comprehensive she suggested that I take part in some of the support groups there at the center which are held every other Wednesday and incidentally the support groups are run by Helen, yes the same Helen that is my case manager. I find that very wonderful and another great thing about the Support Group is that they meet at 12:30 in the afternoon and they provide lunch. I do intend on attending the next support group which will be on Wednesday June 23, 2004. Betz also gave me a copy of Poz Thinking a wonderful magazine which is all about newly diagnosed people and how they handled being diagnosed there was actually some very interesting articles and I have enjoyed reading the magazine. I mentioned my concerns about the situation with the lexapro and not being able to get that prescription filled. Betz thought it would be best if we meet once a week for the next several weeks and stated that I could talk about anything I wanted to talk about, also when she sent me to the scheduler she asked if there was anyway they could get me into see Dr Abi before June 29, and to my surprise they scheduled me to see Dr Abi, the very next morning. So now I have an appointment with the psychiatrist tomorrow morning at 8 am. I also figured since I had that appointment and that since I was scheduled to pick up my weekly basket at  urlLink Poverello  on Wednesday and that I was basically told to expect a full day at the hospital that I would try to pick up my food basket from poverello on Tuesday after my appointment with Dr Abi. The scheduler also informed me that the appointment with Dr Abi was basically an open slot where they schedule 3 or 4 patients at the same time and it's on a first come, first serve basis so if i got there early chances are I would be the first one called.     June 15, 2004 - Psychiatrist Dr Abi reporting    I woke up this morning at 7:00 am just in time to make it early for my appointment I figured let me just get another 5 minutes worth of sleep. I closed my eyes when i re-opened them to my surprise it was 8:30am and I was late for my appointment I rushed and scrambled and still half asleep jumped into the car and headed out for Comprehensive as quickly as possible. I signed in and explained that my alarm had been reset at some point during the night and that was the reason why I was late. Maria at the front desk said that it wasn't a problem and soon enough I was being called by Dr Abi. He is a middle aged balding man who talked with a really funny accent, he basically asked me some of the same questions that Betz had asked me just previously the day before I explained to him that I had an appointment orginally scheduled with him for June 29, and explained the situation with the lexapro to him. I also let him know the dosage of Trazadone really wasn't always working for me that more often then not after taking the one pill at bedtime that 2 or 3 hours later I was still not able to sleep and then I'd end up taking another pill to try and go ahead and sleep. I told him in the past they had given me Buspar and that it seemed to help me with anexity which is what it was originally prescribed for previously. So he stated that Buspar was formulary and wrote me a prescription for Buspar 15mg to be taken twice daily, also in addition to that he increased the Trazadone from 50mg to 100mg and stated that I could take 1 or 2 tablets at bedtime.   After my appointment I stopped by the house and called Alex and explained that I was going to be having the IGIV at the Cancer Center all day Wednesday and had no transportation on Thursday and asked if it was possible to pick up my food basket on today and he stated that it would be okay to do that and then from then on out my regular pick up day would be on Tuesdays. I headed out to Poverello stopped by the health department and dropped off my prescriptions and then headed home and dropped off the food. I then stopped back by the health department and picked up the prescriptions and then headed back over here to Patti & Cathy's house.     June 16, 2004 - Immune Globulin IV    I woke up this morning at 7am, got dressed and stopped by my house, I picked up a huge container of sliced Mangos, a bananna, an orange and a blueberry muffin and headed to the Cancer Center for my  urlLink Immune Globulin IV  (IGIV) at the Center Center.   Upon registering I was taken back to the treatment area and told to choose a lounger I felt comfortable in, they explained where everything was located the restrooms, the nourishment center (where I could store my lunch, find boost and insure, and find juices) they even had a little video libary where I could choose a movie to watch during my treatment. I immediately picked out Jumanji with Robin Williams. The nurse (John) came over and asked if I had ever had  urlLink IGIV  before? I stated that I hadn't ever experienced a treatment before. He was very informative about what he was going to do, he explained they would infuse it very slowly so that I wouldn't have any kind of a reaction, he also told me that before stating the IV that he was going to dispense a couple of tylenol and that in the IV they were going to put benadryl and that this would probably cause a little drowsiness. He offered me a headset for the television and then gave me the tylenol and got the IV kit and started the IV. He didn't lie when he said that it would make me a little drowsy because I was passed out before the movie previews where over and had passed out prior to the movie beginning. I woke up at about 3:30pm and still had a couple of hours of infusion left. I finally finished the infusion about 5:30pm.    June 17, 2004 - Blood Pressure Check    This morning I had a 11:15am appointment with the Comprehensive to have my blood pressure checked however I woke up not feeling that well and felt very overwhelmed so I called up and cancelled the appointment. I told them that I need to come into the center monday to meet with the psychologist and asked if it was okay to have my blood pressure checked when I come in on Monday. It just so happens shortly after that Helen called me and stated that she needed me to come in on to sign the application for Tuesdays Angels so that she could submit my application to them for rental assistance. I told her that I really wasn't feeling well, but that I would do my best to make it into the office to sign the paperwork she needed me to sign. I arrived at the office right prior to lunch time, she had the paperwork sitting at the front desk and Maria had me sign the paperwork. I had loaded up the dogs and had them in the car, I intended to take them to Bark Park so they could run around the park unleashed and have a little bit of fun. I hung out at the park for about 45 mins they had a blast playing around in the park. I picked up Patti and Cathy at the airport shortly after 8pm and we all went out to Lesters Diner for dinner. I had bbq pork loin and mashed potatos, split pea soup and rice pudding with iced tea. They dropped me off at my house and we made arrangements to pick up things at the store and discussed them possibly bringing the dog and cat over when they leave for Arkansas, or they might end up renting a car to drive up to Arkansas. I was glad to be home because I was able to call my lover Frank and talk to him on the phone. He has absolutely been solid as rock ever since I told him about my diagnosis and I am really thankful that I have him in my life, for without him I think I'd be totally going insane, without him in my life.

       June 21, 2004 - Chaos Again   This week has begun with some awfully eventful happenings already first I had an appointment this morning with Betz Davies, I attempted to lay down at about 4am this morning and all the sudden my little chihuahua girl I had noticed was acting very strange. As I began petting her, I realized that she was starting to have contractions. This wasn't something I had looked forward to happening at this venture in time. If you can picture it I rushed around finding her water dish, food bowl, leash, clothing (for myself), the car keys and rushing out the door. I wasn't sure how long I'd have before she started having the puppies but I knew it was only about a 10 minute drive without traffic. The minute I started the engine the dog starting to pant very heavily and so I started stepping on the gas and flying trying to get to the my house in time so she felt save, and secure in her own environment without any other animals around. She had the first chihuahua puppy about 6:45am and the second puppy about 7:30am by the time I made sure she was okay it was about 8:30am and I laid down until 9:40am for my appointment with Betz.   I barely made my 10am appointment on time actually I was about 10 mins late but that is because of the slow ass woman behind the counter at comprehensive care, her name is Maria and she's really friendly, and actually she works probably harder than anyone else but none the less she still takes her sweet ass time.  The appointment with Betz was pretty good, she asked me what was going on and I basically told her everything that had gone on, told her how exhausted I was from not sleeping all night, told her about me becoming a new daddy all over again. I told her about the buspar making me feel dizzy, and the the trazadone giving me headaches. I mentioned that I was worried about being able to pay my rent and so forth. She really didn't provide any relief to me as all she could do is listen, she offered me no advice what so ever. She thought that it would be good for me to come in and see her again next week, while I am standing at the scheduler I discover that Betz name isn't Betz it's BETH as in ELIZABETH, why didn't anyone correct me?? I feel like a real putz but I guess this most be a joke with the center, nobody knows their real names??? -- It just makes me remember when Debbie kept calling me Mr Jackson that first day I had to go through the financial interview.     June 22,2004 - No Need For Approval.    I realize today how much good I'm doing having this Blog in existence at first it was something I created just for myself and then the more and more that I began thinking about it the more I had decided that I wanted to include a list of resources I had found out about that has helped me out, then the logistics set in, what purpose would that serve unless I shared it with the other people. I knew that doing this would expose myself to certain jerks who would use my own words to attack me with. After making sure that I got the lay out just the way I wanted and had the links included on the sidebar I pasted a link on my Yahoo profile. I knew that some people would be ignorant about the disease, and well again if this works to educate a few then there is a lot of great things it does.   Today Jamie (j2k) asked me in the open chat, if I was HIV and at frist I was slightly put on edge or guard 1/2 expecting a stupid comment (why i'm not sure because jamie has always struck me as a pretty intelligent guy, but I also know he can be a bit of a smart ass at times) so I asked if he had read my blog, he said that he was getting ready too, and that was the reason he had asked. The conversation that followed was absolutely fantastic as he shared a story about a young man he knew that that had a difficult time dealing with being diagnosed HIV positive, which is exactly the purpose is to give strength to others through my own personal journey. I was very embraced by Jamies conversation and embraced by a few other people like Cassidy aka Stryder19la  and quite a few others embraced me and to those who did, THANK YOU. There were also some others who thought they could use the issue of me being positive to wish me harm, or to attempt an attack on me based upon me sharing this journal in the open manor in which I share, those who do that take a minute to realize how STUPID you look when you open your mouth with your comments like "hope you die soon", "he probably doesn't love himself that much".  Your approval is neither needed nor is it required. If this journal helps someone it's all worth while and after today I know that I'm on the right path for what I wish to accomplish which primarily is to provide support, and strength for other people especially youth like myself inflicted with this disease and secondly to education ignorant asses who don't have a clue.    Also again I need to thank my partner the most, he's been the biggest rock for me to lean against, hes a wonderful man and I love him very deeply from the bottom of my heart. It's really through his strength that I'm able to open myself up the way I have done so. I love you baby don't ever forget that!!!

      I sort of fell off a little bit last week with my writing on the blog as my brain had become, mushy pure mush. Between the puppies, the dogs, the cat, doctor's appointments I just wasn't up to releasing things on the blog So I'll bring you up to date. On Wednesday June 23, 2004. I attended the Support Group run by Helen, also I had my appointment with the pharmacist. I really enjoyed and got a great amount of support with the group. At first I set back and was the little wall flower listening but it didn't take very long before I was interjecting my thoughts. I think i'm expeirencing a tadbit of depression seeping through all my positivity. Prior to going to the support group I contacted the hospital unit that took my application for Food Stamps and Medicaid and the woman there told me "oh we'll have to call them and find out what is going on with your appointment?" I was like OMG, and figured i'd wait and give her a day or two.  After the support group I had my 2:30 appointment with the pharmacist, of course the dumb bitch financial counselor had my chart on her desk and nobody could find it. So I set there a lot longer than they had anticipated. I finally started medication for HIV Wednesday evening taking my first dosage. I am now on Keletra, Epivir, and Viread in addition i'm taking a mutli-vitamin (pre-natal go figure). I feel like I made out like a bandit. I was given a week dosage planner, a watch with an alarm to set for medication time, a water bottle, and a thermal bag to carry my medications in. FANTASTIC!!! I never did make Poverello this week but then the fridge is packed tightly with plenty of food. Wednesday passed still no information about the food stamps and medicaid, Thursday passed still no word. Finally Friday I called Ms Soust-Sims and she informed me that she had just gotten the appointment for me and that it was scheduled for 10:30am Monday. OMG when where they going to notify me??? it's only taken me a month to get the appointment to begin with!!!   Okay so Department of Children and Family Services was the appointment that I went on today, SHEESH what is it that these people want. THEY are really unreal, first of all I get there at 10:30 im not called until almost noon time. Then all the woman taking the information about my case can do is look down upon me and show absolutely no emotion, Her name was Ms Jordan and if i have to deal with her anymore I will totally loose it, she was so emotionless she was like a fawkin ice cube. Yes today was a little frustrating because I really dislike being treated like I'm not even a human being. I did find out today that Tuesday's Angels did pay atleast one month of rent for me and hopefully they will be paying another month. Helen did tell me on I believe it was Wednesday or Thursday that they had agreed to pay 2 months of rent, but duane only recieved a check for $650.00. So some things are looking up. Tomorrow I have treatment and then the Psychiatrist.

      Alrighty I felt that it was really a time to update, I had been keeping this journal on a daily basis in the beginning as it seemed that I was bombarded with a myriad of appointments and yes they are still all on-going. However they aren't as badly as in the beginning and THANK GOD for that. It would just happen that I would decide to update the blog and bring things up to date at point in time when I'm having a conflict with Treatment I am currently getting. I actually wanted to update the blog last night but then it would have just been an vent and bitch session.  Okay so on with update.  &nbsp;  Last I posted it was about the 28th of June's appointment with DCF and how the (un-racially motivated) Monkeys at the  urlLink DCF (Department of Children &amp; Family Services)  office work. Which just to re-iteriate is totally emotionless and almost robotic in nature.&nbsp; The case worker had requested additional information for me to bring into her office and set a deadline of July 9, 2004. In the interim I recieve a letter&nbsp; on about 7/1 dated 6/29 the day after my appointment with  urlLink DCF  of approval from the Food Stamp program for 0.00 dollars worth of benefit from 6/25 - 6/30. She didn't go by the application date, which was actually 6/3. I was basically screwed out of benefits for the month of June being as I hadn't applied directly with  urlLink DCF  of course this totally set me off I immeidately called Rose Soust-Simms at the hospital district and informed her that the next time someone had mentioned they were in "Dire Need" that she suggest to them they immediately go apply with  urlLink DCF  so that they will recieve benefits (atleast the food stamp) portion immediately. Then the information said that I was eligible to recieve $10.00 in food stamps from 7/1 - 7/31. then on the next page there was a notice saying that my eligibility had been increased from $10.00 to $114.00. I was like wow significant change.&nbsp; I&nbsp;swear the&nbsp;way they inform you of the you're&nbsp;eligibility is just a way to confuse you even more so.&nbsp;At the end of the letter there was information about&nbsp;"lifeline" so I immediate faxed over my letter of eligibility to the phone company.  &nbsp;  Lifeline is a program that is run by Bell South, where they issue you a $13.50 credit, the requirements are that you must provide Bell South with 1. Food Stamp Eligibility Letter, proof of SSI,&nbsp;a Medicaid card or be on the low income home energy assistance program in order to quailify for the credit.  &nbsp;  I saw Dr Sharma on 7/1/2004 a couple of days early because of the some of the issues I was having such as Nausea, vomiting and diahhrea in addition to feeling sore and achy all over. I had told Dr Sharma that some of the specialist that he originally wanted me to see, that i'm not able to see them on an expeited basis. Example of this is the Nuerologist they want me to see the soonest appointment that could be made was for Jan 26, 2005. I discussed with Dr Sharma that I wasn't going to be dealing with the pain until he was able to get me approved for imitrex (for the headaches I have).&nbsp; Dr Sharma consulted with the pharmacist on staff and they decided to give me Fioriset #3, which is actually the pain medication that works the best for me anyway.  I went over to the health department's pharmacy they attempted filling the script for just regular Fioriset of course I had to argue with the pharmacist but sure enough when he pulled at the script he noticed that it was Fiorset w/codiene. He stamped the back of the script and sent me over to Broward General Hospital for their pharmacy to fill it (as is the case with all class 2 medication). I arrived at Broward General right before closing only to find out they don't have the medication in stock, they said they would order it and that it would be available the next morning by 10am.  &nbsp;  On Friday July 2, 2004 I went and picked up the prescription from the pharmacy, and all was great.&nbsp; Had a wonderful July 4 weekend, spent the fourth with Patti &amp; Cathy, and they knowing&nbsp;my italian heritage suggested we order food from Sal's one of the best Italian Resturants here in&nbsp;Ft Lauderdale over all a great time was had by all of us.  &nbsp;  On Tuesday July 6, 2004 I had my appointment with the Opathmologist they were ruling out Retinis, Glucoma, light sensitivity and a host of other things. Prior to his appointment I dropped off the letters at the  urlLink DCF  Office for the additional information that monkey required me to get filled out. Since the office was located right behind a warehouse where I once worked I decided that I'd try to track down some old work acquaintences much to my surprise Direct Mail Center had closed that location but the girl was very helpful she gave me the new address where they had moved, still having about an hour to kill and knowing the address was only a few minutes away off I went. When I pulled into Direct Mail Center not a car was insight, I entered the building and was greated by the NOW owner of the company (Ken), Ken and I talked for about 30&nbsp;- 45 minutes and the bottom line is that I may have just landed myself a part-time work out of my home job. I explained to him what was going on with my health issues and told him that I was not necessarily interested in returning to work full time atleast not until I get my health issues more managable (which they are becoming). He was totally cool with it, and I figured I'd follow up with him in a couple of weeks. I think proceeded onto my appointment. They put drops in my eyes which Dialited my eyes, and then I was told "you can go ahead and be able to drive without a problem", at first I was fine, then went i stepped out into the sun I could hardly keep my eyes open let alone see two fingers in front of my face. Some how or another I managed to make it over to poverello (about 2 miles away) and there I wasted some time looking at things in the thrift store, and then going to request my food, after a couple of hours had passed I figured let me attempt to drive home, again I am not sure how I made it, but with the grace of god I did.&nbsp; I arrived home to find an additional letter in my mailbox from the Disability Claims examiner advising me that he had scheduled the appointment with SSA's pscyhiastrist for July 13, 2004 at 1:30pm  &nbsp;  I have noticed since starting HAART (Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy) that I have a tremendous amount of muscle pain, it's almost as though my legs feels like i've walked 25 miles or taken a long long run. I am sore just walking across the room and obviously being sore it takes me a little longer to get around right now. Also I noticed talking to a couple of different people on the telephone that all the sudden just from holding the phone to my ear my right hand was going numb, several people have said it is a since of neuropathy which is a muscle disease and can be one of the long term effects of HAART however I just started medication so it shouldn't be happening this soon.  &nbsp;  On July 9, 2004 I contacted the bitch at  urlLink DCF  and advised her that I still hadn't recieved my benefit card and asked why my date of application was considered to be June 25, when I had actually signed all the forms June 3. She advised me that it takes up to 2 weeks for me to recieved the Electronic Benefits Card, and that they go by the date the office recieves the paperwork. So basically the hospital district set on my paperwork from June 3, 2004, until June 25, 2004, which totally pissed me off. I was also approaching another week where it seemed like there was an appointment every single day.  &nbsp;  On July 12, 2004 I had an appointment with Beth (the psychotherapist) I am really finding that I'm getting absolutely nothing out of talking to this woman, although very nice, and sweet and sometimes it's great to get things off your chest, bottom line is that I'm beginning to view this as wasted time. At the end of our session she wanted to see me back in 2 weeks which puts that appiontment on the day of my birth. I mentioned that and she still encouarged me to make the appointment which I did but am considering cancelling and not making any other additional appointments with this lady.  &nbsp;  On July 13, 2004 my day started with of course my treatment (my weekly treatment day is Tuesday), then from there I had a few errands which cathy had asked me to run for her and being as I was borrowing her car felt obligated to do. Then at 12:30 I was rushing over to poverello picked up my food basket for the week and proceeded over to Dr Adele Bessner's office which is the psychiatrist that SSA had scheduled me to see. I felt that the appointment with the psychiatrist for SSA went some what well, i didn't try to fake any answers but I didn't give the most obvious either (ie... What does a bike &amp; a bus have in common).. most people would have answered that question with "They are both methods of transportation" .. i responded "they both have wheels", so anyway&nbsp;I don't know how long the process will be before they get the report back&nbsp;I know when I spoke to the medical examiner he stated that it would take a couple of weeks to get the appointment and probably a couple&nbsp; of weeks to get their report he should have all the records he needs, and although&nbsp;numerous people have told me the first attempt will be denied, there have been others that told me they were approved within 2 1/2 - 3 months.&nbsp; So i'm just hoping that they will&nbsp;rush my case along.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only thing I can really do is sit and wait.  &nbsp;  On July 15, 2004 I had appointments with the pharmacist at comprehensive, and also the doctor. I told the doctor that i was in major pain from&nbsp;every muscle in my body that&nbsp;twice talking on the phone that my hand went completely&nbsp;numb and inquired whether this was a possible side effect&nbsp;of the HAART medication I was on, he&nbsp;assured me that it's not a side effect. He gave me an additional script for the fiorset #3, only hitch here was that went&nbsp;I got over to 84 they refused to fill it, said that it wasn't on the forumla. Then pharmacist then insists that they didn't fill the script for me back on June 30, 2004 when I last saw&nbsp;Dr Sharma &nbsp;then finally after calling the supervisor they discovered that someone had to have given the approval because Broward General had actually filled it and they lost revenue because it was a medication that ryan white wouldn't pay for.&nbsp; I left the prescription at walgreens.&nbsp;I got home to find a notice&nbsp;about my food stamps seems they increased the benefit&nbsp;from&nbsp;$114.00 to $141.00 a month, how sweet of them.&nbsp; &nbsp; On Friday July 16, I called  urlLink APFL  to find out about my options for coordinating my care through them, I also placed calls to Helen (my case managers), Rose Marie (the clincial nurse) who claimed that Dr&nbsp;Sharma was refusing to give me Percoset or Vicodin. I called Sami&nbsp;(the pharmacist) who immeidately called me back and after telling me that she would call and find out what was going on, proceeded to tell Rose Marie had already gotten it handled Dr Sharma had given me a prescription for Darvacet. &nbsp;after also talking to some great friends like vitki it was discovered that there are two IMPORTANT side effects to the Epivir which is the muscle pain and the tingling of fingers and toes which relate to the epivir even though the doctor refused to acknowledge these as side effects. David from  urlLink APFL   called me back and explained they have no more funding this year for ryan white patients, however once I got the medicaid approval I would be more than able to use their services. Now i'm praying strongly that medicaid is approved quickly in the meantime I have some major choices to make, go off the epivir until i'm able to see another doctor?, continue on with this doctor with my pain, attempt seeing another doctor at this center?? -- I am not really sure what the hell to do.  &nbsp; Over this weekend I was armed with sites, and even pointed towards the AMA site and still have alot more research and fighting ahead of me, but I'll be dammed if i settle of uneducated doctors whose bedside manner or who lack trust in their patients. I will back both Sami &amp; Dr Sharma into a corner with this muscle pain issue being a side effect this week because they both have stated "No", more so Doctor Sharma than the pharmacist. BUT we will see exactly what happens in this week to come. I do intend on keeping my appointment with the psychiatrist but not sure about any other appointments I have outstanding.  &nbsp; I will try to post events that happen this week in a timely manner being as all of this is going on and it leaves some concern about the medications that i'm on, and whether this on drug in particular could be doing more damage than good. &nbsp;   &nbsp;
