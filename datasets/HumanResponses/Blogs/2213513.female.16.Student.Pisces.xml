      SUNRIVER wow, I had fun I guess til I got sick last night...which was saturday night. It was my idea to go look at the lodge lights and the I get sick on the way there...I was mad. Well, I left wednesday after school and got there at like 8. The next day was Turkey Day! and Lynzi was in Sunriver too so Ben and I went to meet up with her at the sled park. We had a nice snowball fight. Then we had a big dinner and I actually ate a lot this thanksgiving, usually I don't. Friday we went shopping, which was actually not bad considering it's the busiest day of the year shopping wise. I got new pants, lol, and shorts for PE and earrings and a necklace for winterball and Lynzi's xmas present! OMG I just realized I haven't watched the tape with Paul Walker on the View yet! I'll go watch it after this! Ok, so then saturday I did pretty much nothing and then got sick after dinner while we were driving to the Lodge, stayed in the car while everyone went inside. Then while everyone played Mexican Train I stayed in bed. (Mexican Train is a domino game, it takes too long to explain.) Oh, and we rented 2Fast 2Furious and Lord of the Rings, Two Towers on friday night and watched them both that night. I reccomend the 2Fast 2Furious DVD if you rent, it has some funny outtakes. Also we played UNO thursday night, which got kind of violent. We learned a bunch of new rules though and I played where you keep score and stuff, which was weird! OH and my camera doesn't work still, which im pissed about! Anyway, I'm out. See ya later! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play PS: OMG IM SO MAD I DIDNT EVEN GET TO GO SNOWBOARDING WHILE I WAS THERE!

      ADVENTURES IN NEW PANTS I got new pants on sunday because my mom and I went to the mall. So I wore them yesterday (11/24) and I really like them. I also got my winterball dress. It's really cute. It's black and red. I'm not going to describe any more of it because I don't want my date knowing, lol, I want it to be a suprise. Other than that sunday was uneventful. Just the mall. Monday was like any other monday. My photo teacher still hates me but likes Kari now. She always sends her on little arrands around the school now. I swear. Today was really boring, Lynzi left for sunriver and I might leave tomarrow but I'm not sure, it depends on the snow. You know the new Dashboard Confessional song, Hands Down, I LOVE that song! I just had to share. I really want that new CD. Oh I got 47 out of 50 on my spanish oral, so I was really happy. Haha today on the test my teacher put "el gato es muy feo y malo" and for you non-spanish speakers that means "the cat is very ugly and bad" I started cracking up. Paul Walker was on The View this morning and I taped it, I hope I got it all because I started it late. I had Paul Walker on the Late Show already on the tape and I'm really hoping The View didn't tape over it or skip any parts with Paul. Hes so gorgous! His new movie comes out tomarrow! Oh and also The Starting Line's new acoustic ep came out today. I've downloaded almost all the songs but I'm still asking for it for christmas. It's pretty good. Today after school I had a really bad stomache ache but it went away after I took something for it. It's weird because I've been feeling kind of iffy latley. Maybe if I don't feel good tomarrow we won't have to go to Sunriver. Some of you might ask why..I'll tell ya...I don't want to spend fricken 4 days with Mark. (To refresh Mark is my moms boyfriend.) Anywho, I better go! Adios! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play

      ODS CRAZIES Wow, today was soo fun! I met up with a few student leaders from my week of outdoor school and a staff member. Sushi, Apples, Cascade, Salamander and Zehas, Odin was with us for like half an hour but didn't acutally do any of the running around. First we all met up at Lloyd Center and then from there made an unplanned stop at this oreintal store, it was the coolest little place and we got these sodas that were sooo cool! lol, I can't really explain it but they were just awesome. Then we went to Saturday Market and listened to the live music for like 10 minutes and went to pioneer courthouse square and went pee and saw Wolf! the nurse from outdoor school! Then from there we went to Powells books and played Sardines, which was a lot of fun. Sardines, if you don't know, is like hide and seek but when you find the person you hide with them and then the last person to find everyone is it. And if you haven't been to Powells downtown, its HUGE! Theres like 10 different sections of books and most of them are really big. Then from there we got pizza at Roccos Pizza, I had never been there before but it's a cool place. The pizza is pretty good, not as good as Escape from New York Pizza but pretty good. So then after that we were heading back to nowhere, just kind of wandering and Zehas, Sushi, Salamander and I ended up ditching Apples and Cascade because we ran around a corner when they went into a store. So they went to Nordstrom and we followed them and then finally got back on the max and went back to Lloyd Center and then Zehas, Cascade, Sushi and I wandered for 10 minutes and then I had to leave. I had a great time though, even though we really didn't do anything. But yeah, since I spent all day just wandering around tomarrow I have to do a bunch of housework and homework. It was worth it though. I also have to look for a winterball dress tomarrow! Well I gotta go, talk to you later homes! lol  *Kate ~love is like a role that we play

      CHINA with the Heideggers! I love going out to eat with the Heideggers, they are the funnest family. Kare I know your reading this and yes, its true. Lol, they just all crack me up. I was so pissed today when i woke up because I really didn't want to go to school. I pulled a Korey and when my mom woke me up I said "mmmmm I hate my life" and went back to sleep. Just to be awoken again 5 minutes later with my mom saying "KATE YOU NEED TO GET UP NOW!" so I got to school with my jaw hurting because I was yawning so much. I really dislike B days too, which is tomarrow. Lets see...2nd period I hate the teacher. 4th period the class is useless. 6th period I hate the class and 8th period I double hate the class. Ehh, sophomore year is not really all that great. I'm excited for next year though because I'm going to have a bunch of fun classes. Well, I guess I thought photo and journalism were gonna be fun. Which they are, but the photo teacher just hates me. Journalism is good. I was really excited because we watched Shattered Glass. The new Hayden Christensen movie in there. It's really good. It's out in theaters right now, the fox towers. I reccomend seeing it. Anyway it's thursday and I totally missed friends! Thats kind of upsetting. I'm begining to watch less and less TV. I guess that means I'm getting more and more busy. Plus we don't have cable, so half the time nothings on anyway. I should go though. I'm gonna go be fat and get ice cream! See you in a while, crocodiles! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play

      THE GOOD AND THE BAD the good is that it SNOWED! OMG i was flipping out at school! I was so excited! I want to go snowboarding so bad now, like no joke. I'm so excited. The bad is that I still don't have a date for winter ball. I want to go but I'm really tired of asking people to dances. I really hope we don't have school tomarrow because I have to write an editorial for my journalism class and I haven't even started. Wrestling is so boring you don't even know. I really don't like it so far. It's kinda just a waste of time. Were watching Cast Away in my health class, it's so random. I have no idea why were watching that movie! I got a 9/10 on my math quiz tho, I was sooo happy. Thats like the best I've ever done on a math test. As for my grade in that class, I still have a B, which is good, I'm not complaining. I have a B in my science class also, I think I can get that back up to an A tho. It's a high B. Timeline comes out the 26th, which im soo excited about and Kari and I are going to go see it the day it comes out! Anyway, I should get started on my editorial!  *Kate ~love is like a role that we play

      So this is my first post and I just want to say that I love Paul Walker..I think he is the most gorgous guy I haven't met. The most gorgous guy I have met is *****. All my close friends know who that is...lol. Anyway, I'm really excited to start the snowboard season! I'm going to sunriver for thanksgiving, and it's crap because we only have 2 f-ing days for thanksgiving this year. But yeah, so I'm going to sunriver, which isn't always a plus...my moms boyfriend, who can be annoying, his parents live there, and they are nice but that means I have to spend a week with Mark, my moms boyfriend. Mark's kids, Teagan and Ben, are 16, a year older than me, and they are nice but Ben beats me up sometimes. I'll put stories on here periodicly. They have their licsenses, which would be helpful to me, you would think, but no, because they just got them...oh well, I'll be getting mine soon! Feb. 24th, thats when i turn the big 1-6! lol, but yeah, SO I'm really excited to go to sunriver this time because one of my bestest friends in the whole wide world is going to be in sunriver at the same time. So Lynzi and I are gonna plan a time to get together because I dont want to be stuck at that house all the time and I know she doesnt want to be stuck at hers either! This is it for now though, check back later! Later Gators! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play

      TRAVLING BUNCO..RIGHT HERE! Haha, at the party I won the travling bunco prize and I was at the head table, parterned with Joshua!...for whoever doesn't play bunco I'm not going to explain it but when you get a bunco you get this little bunco box or something and then when someone else gets a bunco you give it to them, and i was the last person with it so i won that prize! also I had to roll off with like 3 other people for most wins, which was exciting! lol, bunco was so fun at that party, usually i get bored with it after a while. Other that that this weekend, lol friday we had our first tourny for wrestling and we got 2nd out of 8 teams, which was really good. Saturday other than the party I had to go to a frosh wrestling tourny, which sucked, Kari, Kaitlin and I really didn't have to be there,  If  the other F-ing managers knew how to score! I woke up at 5:45 for those mo's. Then I spent the night at Kari's, i really didn't want to be at home because Mark was here and I never do anything when he's here b/c he and my mom always go run arrands all day long. Then my mom got all mad because I didn't call her when I was at Kari's to tell her what was going on, BUT she always calls me when I'm at Kari's....tell me how that makes sense...it doesnt. My mom is just dumb, it was because of Mark and I know it. She knows it too, she just wanted a reason for me not to feel forgotten, so she blamed it on me! I hate how shes changing because of Mark! I know shes happy but does that mean she has to sacrafice my happiness!? I just wish I was old enough to move away, then she could just do what she wanted b/c I wouldnt see her anyway. Seriously, I'm tired of him. I don't care if he's the reason we go on rafting trips and the reason we go to sunriver. I would rather not do those two things than have to keep watching my mom change because shes going out with him. Sorry, if you are totally lost or if that was kind of harsh, I had to vent. I've been thinking about just not caring about my D in photo and seeing what she does if I have a D on my report card. Except that if I do that, i'll become a majority. All the kids who do that, do it because they have family problems and they need attention and/or just stop caring. I don't want to become one of those people. The thing is, my mom is marring this stupid guy even if I keep not liking him. I wonder if I could just not keep in touch with my mom but still keep in touch with the rest of the family, like when i grow up. B/c shes not marring him till Teagan, Ben and I are in college...Ok, I need to stop, this is getting long and too rude. Aloha. *Kate ~love is like a role that we play

      HANDS DOWN TIMELINE WAS WATCHED LATE IN THE EVENING lol, If you didn't catch the title, Hands Down is the new Dashboard song, Timeline is the new Paul Walker movie, that I saw tonite and loved!, and Late in the Evening is a Paul Simon song I'm obsessed with. Anyway, Timeline, is sooooooo good, Paul Walker isn't even in it that much and I still liked it. The main girl, that Paul likes, her name is Kate...it was soo weird hearing him like saying my name like that. The girl was dumb though. Tomarrow there is a wrestling tourny, our first one. OH, and for my journalism class were making newspapers in groups. One of the articles I'm writing for it is an interview with a wrestler. LOL, it's a feature story. I just don't know which wrestler to do yet. I also have to write a news story about our winterball. I'm also the editor of our groups paper. I'm kind of upset though, because the photographer is a frosh, so all the pictures are going to be of freshmen...oh well. As long as we get a good grade! I think it's going to be a really fun project though. Yeah, I have a D in photography. It's because my camera was broken, so I couldn't take pictures! As soon as I turn in my film though I'll have an A, which should be really soon, like end of next week. I think if I met Paul Walker, I would sit there staring at him, not knowing what to do. Hmmm I'm tired so this entry is going to be short! Night! *Kate ~love is like a role that we play

      SUNNY SOCAL Why is it that there are so many more good looking boys in California? Don't get me wrong, there are some lookers here, ahem *****, ***** and a few other random boys, but it just seems like every other guy you run into downt there is cute. Maybe I should go to UCSB. When i was visiting my family they all decided i should go to Uiversity of California, Santa Barbra. They also said that if i decided to go to University of Hawaii, Manoa that they would come visit. Actually they would probably visit me if i was at University of New York too. Since we have family there also. Talking about family from New York, i miss my cousin (actually not my cousin, hes my mom's, cousins son...it's just easier to call him my cousin) Keith, he better come this winter like he said. It would be really cool to take him snowboarding. I'm really bored right now, I wish I could go do something tonight. Wink, wink, someone call me! Well this will be a short blog, there's not much to say about my trip...sadly. I did have fun, but i just don't have any crazy stories...well till i write again, *kate ~and i'm the king of them, pushing everything thats good away

      MAGNUS AND MR. MOON I was just listening to the song Chanson Pour Les Petits Enfants by Jimmy Buffett and it talks about Mr. Moon and his best friend Magnus and they fly away to a magical land and meet Princess Leia, lol it sounds like the guy was on crack when he wrote the song, and maybe he was, but the chorus is all in french and it translates to say something like sing for the little children, sing for all the world. But anyway, wow crazy times these past few days, i wont go into detail because well, certain people might read this. Yesterday&nbsp;Kyle Buck had another party, it wasn't as crazy as the one before. Christina almost beat the record of how many people you can fit in a car, it was crazy, Stina was driving, Stephanie was shotgun, Coty, Kari, Cameron and I were in the backseat and Josh was laying across all of us, we couldnt fit his legs in all the way so the rear right door was open a bit as we were driving around Josh's neighborhood. I spent the night at Karis with Christina and there was alcohol involved, lol. Triple Sec is really easy to take by the way...you like don't even need a chaser. I was kinda tipsy and so Kari and I stayed up till 4 talking about who we would make out with, lol. Lets just say&nbsp;we would make out with quite a few people. Tonight was Kari's SURPRISE PARTY!!!!! WHOO!!! That was fun, Kari was making me mad though! She wouldnt leave her house! Her mom had to like hold her at gunpoint to get her to get in the car! The good thing was she didnt expect it tonight. Tomarrow I leave for SOCAL!! *southern california* Get myself a surfer boy, mmm surfer boys are so cute! Too bad they'll be like, uh oregonian, get away! Hopefully there will be someone cute sitting next to me on the plane! I'll be all by myself! Anywho, I probably won't write when I'm in Cali but when i come back there will be stories, hopefully! KARI AND CHRISTINA...WHAT DOES L STAND FOR!? good times... *kate ~i have seen the others, and i have discovered, that this fight is not worth fighting

      CARRY THIS PICTURE  If you didn't notice thats a Dashboard Confessional song, one of my favorites. Christina and I were belting it out as we drove through all these side streets to get to sandy. Christina, Kari, Jessica and I all went downtown Tuesday. We tried on prom dresses at Mariposa in Lloyd Center just for fun, Kari found a really cute pink one with silver stars all over, Christina complained that she didn't have anything to hold up the dresses, but CLEARLY she has more than I do...Jessica tried on a less dressy one that was really cute too. I tried on a really cute polka dot dress that wasn't dressy enough to wear to winterball and too dressy just to wear to school and a black version of a dress Christina tried on. Finally yesterday I got some color, Kari and I laid outside like the whole day. My cousin Stephanie&nbsp;got here yesterday, she lives in LaGrande, she drove up because she was catching a plane today to see her boyfriend in Alaska. I think next summer I'm going to go with her for like a week. She says some parts of Alaska can get up to 80 degrees in the summer. 2 days till kari's bday!! 2 days till i leave for california!! 16 days till camp!! Yeah, I'm leaving for california on Kari's bday, but I'm going to call her before i leave, at like 8am, to wake her up and say HAPPY BIRTHDAY! You know you love it Kare. People keep talking about how I'm so close to going off to college and Its starting to worry me, what if I don't get in to either college i want to go to? Right now I'm really torn between University of Hawaii, Manoa and New York University. Two very different schools that are both very far away. That's what I want though, to be far away. I don't want to stay in Oregon, I want to go be on my own. Actually It would be nice if like at least one of my friends was with me, and&nbsp;both Lynzi and Kari&nbsp;said that they might want to go to college in Hawaii. If i go to NYU then my family will all be like half an hour to an hour or so away. Anyway, it's summer so I'm not going to worry myself with those things! *kate  ~your smile is the most genuine thing, that i've ever seen

      20 DAYS TILL CAMP!!  OMG, i totally didn't realize how close camp was! I'm so excited! I found out&nbsp;a few of my favorite counselors are going to be there and its&nbsp;making me even more anxious! Here's a good story from last summer, actually its like two stories in one, 2 for 1 today! Ok, here we go: The last morning of my second week (i was there for a total of three weeks) one of the counselors had decided to sleep through breakfast so my friends and I got permission from the camp director and went to wake him up...with water. All total there was 6 people with pitchers full of water. When we found his cabin we were all cracking up so hard that we woke him up before we got to pour the water on him. Of course we did it anyway! He was so soaked by the time i was close enough to pour the water on him, that i didnt, and just ran out instead. When i saw the look on his face i could tell he was really pissed. We had gotten a bunch of his clothes and books and stuff wet because it was all sitting near his bed. We all ran back to the dining hall and ended up leaving without talking to Flame (the counselor). Welllll the next week he vowed to get us back and said he was going to get ahold of our parents to get their permission to wake us up with water like we did to him. All of us did not want to be woken up that way and so we tried to get him to forget about it. By the end of the week he couldnt get ahold of our parents so he waited till we were waiting around to leave the last morning. My friend Kari and I saw him coming up the trail&nbsp;with two big pitchers of water and she immeadiately hid behind a tree. All the other people that were with us that hadn't gotten him wet the week before were freaking out thinking he was just going to get anyone. My friend Brennan and I started running down the path behind him when he was distracted but he ended up getting Brennan. After getting Brennan and some other people he only had about half a pitcher left but i still didn't want to get wet! I saw some bluewingers (6 year olds) with a counselor down the trail a little farther and so i decided to&nbsp;hold a little girl&nbsp;hostage while Flame came after me. I&nbsp;yelled "you cant&nbsp;get a little bluewinger wet!!" as i hid behind this random&nbsp;kid. Flame and the counselor that was with the bluewingers were just cracking up. Then i started telling Flame how i hadn't even gotten him wet the week before and he called a truce between us. When he poured out the water he had left i came out from behind the kid. lol it might not sound funny, but it really was. Well considering those stories were really long, im going to say "stick a fork in this post, its done!"  *kate

      HOLY BLOGGER BATMAN OMG I totally forgot i had this! Sooooooo much has happened since I last wrote! I don't even know where to start, so i won't lol. If something exciting comes to mind i'll post it. I can't believe all my friends and I are going to be juniors, thats so crazy. Today i went to Red Robin with the group and there were 16 people there, only 3 of them weren't from H.B.Lee. I guess that could be good and bad. Good because we've stuck together and stayed friends for so long. Bad because we've stuck together and haven't branched out. Actually a lot of us have though, we all have friends from other social groups. Which reminds me, I'm going to go to the Zoo to visit a staff member from ODS with Lynzi next week! I'm really excited, the staff member, Casper, is the coolest guy and i haven't seen him since my spring week of ODS and i wanted lynzi to meet him. I don't know why i think hes so cool, he just is. He's my field instructor for plants. OH that reminds me, I'm going to be a CIT this year with Kari and Kaitlin at Namanu, and im sooo excited! Except a few of my favorite counselors aren't going to be there :-(. Well i think this entry is going to stop here, I'll write again soon!  *kate "ever so sweet, you baked it in cakes for me"

      i changed my mind...this is my new favorite song, the brilliant dance by dashboard confessional *NOT PLURAL...JUST ONE CONFESSION! sorry its a  really big  pet peeve of mine when people say "dashboard confessionals" IF YOU WERE A REAL FAN YOU WOULD KNOW THAT THERE IS NO 'S' AT THE END!  So this is odd, the painful realization that has all gone wrong. And nobody cares at all, and nobody cares at all.  So you buried all your lover's clothes and burned the letters lover wrote, but it doesn't make it any better. Does it make it any better?  And the plaster dented from your fist in the hall where you had your first kiss reminds you that the memories will fade.  So this is strange, our sidestepping has come to be a brilliant dance where nobody leads at all, where nobody leads at all.  And the picture frames are facing down and the ringing from this empty sound is deafening and keeping you from sleep. And breathing is a foreign task and thinking's just too much to ask and you're measuring your minutes by a clock that's blinking eights.  This is incredible. Starving, insatiable, yes, this is love for the first time. Well you'd like to think that you were invincible. Yeah, well weren't we all once before we felt loss for the first time? Well this is the last time.

      IM IN LOVE! (BUT NOT REALLY...) So yeah...this guy i saw on myspace.com is like absolutly gorgous and i want to meet him very badly. His name is Davis, good lord hes hot, he lives in Milwaulkie, i dont know how to spell that by the way. Yeah, so Lynzi better call me because i really want to go to the zoo tomarrow...so because i dont really have anything else to say other than happy birthday jessica!! im going to leave you with lyrics of my favorite song right now, another lonley day by ben harper...  Yes indeed, I'm alone again. And here comes emptiness crashing in. It's either love or hate, I can't find in between, 'cause I've been with witches and I've been with a queen. It wouldn't have worked out anyway.  So now it's just another lonely day. Further along we just may. But for now it's just another lonely day.  Wish there was something now I could say or do. I can resist anything but the temptation from you. But I'd rather walk alone than chase you around. I'd rather fall myself than let you drag me on down. It wouldn't have worked out anyway.  And now it's just another lonely day. Further along we just may. But for now, it's just another lonely day.  Yesterday seems like a life ago, 'cause the one I love today, I hardly know, You I held so close in my heart, Oh dear, Grow further from me with every fallen tear. It wouldn't have worked out anyway.  So now it's just another lonely day. Further along we just may. But for now it's just another lonely day. For now it's just another lonely day. For now it's just another lonely day.

      GOSH! I really want to see that movie Napoleon Dynamite, it looks so funny. It's only playing at the fox towers though...i'm in a weird mood right now. I don't even know why im feeling so weird. i can't describe it either its like im enerjectic, depressed, pensive, nervous, excited, lonely, tired...basically a really random selection of emotions...all at the same time. I also have a weird urge to be outside, would it be totally odd if i slept outside tonight? Yeah it would. My mom would think im crazy, maybe i'll just do it. I also have an urge to be on my own, like i really want to go somewhere alone. Hmm i could go downtown to go shopping, that might be fun...well im really fumbling trying to write stuff tonight so i think i'll just end this rambling here, ta ta... *kate ~we can live like jack and sally if you want
