      Well today was the first official day of summer! A new beginning, a beginning of freedom and NO ALGEBRA!!!!!!  It was also an end for some. Some of my best friends graduated tonight! I tried my hardest not to cry but found it impossible during some parts. :( LoL  Poor Mikey was unable to attend cuz it takes him 10 minutes just to get up much less get up and around like going into town. I love spending time with him though. Even if we are just sitting around watching T.V. I have this feeling like I am where I am supposed to be. I love him SO much! :) I wouldn't want to be with anyone else for a long long longggggg time. I feel VERY lucky and I think I would DIE without him! LoL  Have you ever seen "You've Got Mail" ?? It's SOOO good. I love how Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks act together. It's so natural!!!  Today I was discussing with Mikey's dad what I was going to do with my future. He said that Mikey had mentioned to him how I was going to go into Nurse School after highschool. Well, that's kinda what my mom wanted me to do. Not really my aspiration, but I guess it would be ok? I dunno. I would much rather major in English and be a journalist or something. I love to give my natural opinion and what could be better than getting paid for it!?!...while using my awesome typing skills! hehe... Well, I'm going to go. I'm staying the night with my Grandma. Sometimes I miss little things like that from when I was young. Hehe, I'm crazy. Adios amigo! ~ChRiStIn

      Well, I took the top off my Jeep yesterday.. how smart I was for doing such a thing. LoL It just happened to try to rain today. I had to go move my Jeep in the middle of a test cuz it was starting to sprinkle. Pretty bad! Well then it cleared up and on my way home from town, running errands for the mommy, it started raining on me, but instead of freakin I just enjoyed it! Not many people can do that! So it was kool.  We're taking out semester tests today and tomorrow. BLahhhh! But the sooner we do it, the sooner it'll be over with. Cuz Thursday all I have is P.E. and I'm actually exempt, sooooo school can officially be out then. Fun funnnn! My mom's like, "RAAR JOB RARR!" LoL Just kidding, she's not freaking too much, she just doesn't like fishing out the money every week for gas. Not my fault! LoL I just drive to school and sometimes to Mikey's!!! :) My Mikey's getting his surgery tomorrow morning. :( I hope it goes well. I'm gonna go see him after school tomorrow, bring him some soup or something. :) Well words low! Adios! ~ChRiStIn

      Well, today I'm supposed to go to Fort Worth. I have a dance for my Church. Mikey is supposed to go with me but I don't know if his parents will let him. They were going to let him, but now they're changing their mind cuz they want him to stay at home and "Study".:( But yeah.. newayz.... My cousin is graduating tonight. It's so weird cuz we're only two years apart! That's going to be me in two years!!!! :S Thinking about the future in that kind of way scares me. I don't want to grow up! I don't even know what college I'm going to right now or nething. I kinda want to go on a mission, but I guess if it's meant to be then I'll know. So yeah. Gotta go! Later! ~ChRiStIn

      Well, it's finally here! Thank goodness! Friday! Tonight is the sports banquet. Fun funnnnnn.... I am going to town here in a couple of minutes to get me an outfit just for the occasion. :D I love to go shopping! :)  Mikey left school today at 11:30 or so to go to Fort Worth.. :( I didn't get to see him much yesterday either. We had this stupid Spanish field trip day.. it was ok but they divided us into groups and Mikey wasn't in mine.. but yeah. Newayzzz...  Tonight should be interesting. Since Coach Manos isn't our coach anymore she's not even handing out our volleyball awards tonight at the thing. Some people said, "Oh that's so immature." But I dunno. I dunno what I would do if I were in that situation either. She just kinda got booted out of her job.. so I think I'd be a little resilient too. (right word??)  Well, I'm listening to my cd that I made at Katy's house! Katy's so kool! LoL She rode with me yesterday to Woodson for our Summer League Bball Game. It was funnnnn. Well gotta go! Later!!!!!! ~ChRiStIn

           Welllll, today was kinda different. School is just kind of dragginb by because there's really nothing to do in every class cuz school's almost over. We're making a web-page in BCIS... so that's pretty kool. The only class that remains the same is Mrs. Bozeman's Alebra class. I love you Mrs. Bozeman! lol...       We got our clothes in for cheerleading camp today. Mrs. Smith kinda messed up and ordered two of the same shirts with different colors..... uh.. yeah.. lol ANYWAYS......      I don't know what to change my MSN name to?? LoL I want it to have something to do with My Mikey... but I dunnno!?!?!  G2G! Later!  ~ChRiStIn

      Well, here is my first offical blog! (Tada Ross!) I think I should be quite good at this. I do have a journal but this should work out well too!  School's almost over, thank goodness. I'm ready to get this whole mess over with. I know that I have to take all of the semester exams because I was absent more than 2 days at school. :( Poopy (as Ross would say... lol)  Speaking of Ross, I think that what he is going through is CRAP. I wish that I could just hit the poo out of some people. Ross is one of the sweetest guys in the world and one day he will find the RIGHT girl for him. I hope that's soon, because I'm sick of seeing him hurt. :) Mikey... hmm.. Mikey... things are going good between us. Really good. I love having him there with me to make me smile. He is truly the greatest! I couldn't ask for more.  As for movies, I just watched Gothika the other day. (Definately not as scary as they made it out to be!) It was really good though. I dunno, I thought it had a really good plot that kept you guessing and everything.  Sunday when I went to Church guess who was there!??! Sean Bradley. He plays for the Dallas Mavericks. Some people may say oh poo, he stinks... he's not that great.. he's a bencher... whatever... I think it's awesome. He's 7'6 and it was really kool to see someone famous in the little town of Graham at MY church!!!!  Have you ever head the song, "I Believe In A Thing Called Love"...? It's by "The Darkness". It's hilarious. Ross and Mikey introduced that one to me and to our surprise..umm about 2 weeks later... we heard it on T.V. and when we looked it was on the advertising to Shrek 2! Awesome! Have to see that one!!! Well, I guess I'll go! Later! ~ChRiStIn

      Wellll, I just got back yesterday from Church Camp. It was actually closer this year so it only took 30 minutes or so to get home. It was nice! LoL Mikey went with my parents up there to pick me up. After we got back to my house I took a shower and him and I went to eat out at Golden China. I looooove that place! My fav. place to eat! After that, we came back to my house and sat there for awhile, then him and I took Cat and Nate out to watch a movie. We watched Dodgeball. It was an o.k. movie, kinda perverted but pretty funny at some parts. Yup, well, today I went and talked to the guy at United,(the one by Wal-Mart) he told me he'd call me later when I knew what my decision was for sure. I definately want the job, but then again I would have to work on Sundays, and it would be after church, but that's still going against all that I believe. I dunno.. we'll see. Other than that, I gotta work tonight at 5...Pizza Pro. Hehe, I think I might even get paid since I wasn't here on Wednesday to get paid! Cha Ching! :D LoL Well g2g! Adios! ~ChRiStIn

      Hehe, yesterday Katy Jane celebrated for her 16th birthday! First we all met out on her land to camp out. The guys came out there, (Mikey, Caine, and Will) and we all ate some hot dogs and sausages. Yuummmmyyy. Well the lightning and thunder kept getting worse and worse, and when Deidre called her mom, her mom said that the storm was coming from Throckmorton and it was only going to get worse. So we packed up our stuff and got the heck out of there. When went to Tori's house, and right as we all got sat down to watch a movie the storm kicked in. LoL Just in time!! We watched Duplex and Gothika. The guys left around 2... late late! And we all went straight to sleep. 'Cept for Caine's car trouble, everything else was okey day. Katy and Deidre stayed up a little longer to watch the Fast and The Furious.. one of their favorites due to the famous actor Paul Walker... blah! LoL Luv ya Katy!  Well, I left Tori's house early this morning cuz I had to go to work at 11. :( I only had to work for about an hour. And now I gotta go back tonight at 5. Fun fun! Mikey is at a family reunion so I miss him terribly. LoL Even though I saw him 11 hours ago! :S:S Hehe... well gotta go! Adios! ~ChRiStIn ElAiNe

      Well, today we went up to the gym at like 4 and played some 4 on 4 and stuff, got some defense tips from Mrs. Bozeman. She's like basketball queen. LoL Wednesday I'm going to the lake! Woohoo! Swimming! Finally!!! :D:D:D Mikey and Ross get to come over tonight! I'm just happy I finally get to see my Mikey!! :) It's been a long long time! :D A whole 5 days! LoL We have a basektball game tomorrow night. And it'll be a here game, so that should be way better than driving for an hour or so. LoL Well, gonna go! Adios! ~ChRiStIn

      I went outside this morning to help my dad with the stupid garden. Well, I was cutting the stem off of a radish and it sliced my finger open. :( Ouchy...  Well, my plans for today are kinda hazy. I was gonna go on a date with Mikey, but his mom decided not to let him and to make him to go Eastland. Her friend is having a birthday party. Yup...  Newayz, I am also babysitting tonight for the cutest kids at church. Which is really really good I think because I really really reallyyyyyyy need gas money! I'm down to less than 1/4 of a tank!!  I don't know when we're supposed to go up to the gym to practice for basketball and all this. Our new coach said he'd be up there like everyday, and when he isn't, his daughter would be. It ticks me off cuz they aren't up there and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. I'm going to start going to the Wellness Center and working out up there. It'd be fun I think! :D  I go the job at Pizza Pro!! I get paid on Wednesday. I've worked 3 days now and it's pretty easy. I've only messed up once cuz I was following what Ross was doing. I'm really kinda clueless there, I really just wash the dishes. LoL Well, I'm gonna go help in the garden AGAIN. My mom's giving me a guilt trip. Adios! ~ChRiStIn

      I had these weird dreams last night.. I'll just let ya'll in on the weird dreams, cuz I find them funny. LoL It first started out with all of us in the school, but of course the school looked different. Then we went to the cafe' for lunch. But we were all ticked cuz a bunch of Jr. High Graham Girls came over to eat lunch there and they kept going back into the kitchen trying to get their food and we were like DUDE WAIT! My GoSH! LoL Then we went back to the school and there was a huge storm coming! (of course, for those of you who don't know, I dream about storms and tornadoes alllllll the time....) Well, I'm trying to go home to get ready for the F-ball game that night, but my Jeep starts acting weird, like was all churning and rocking and making this grinding noise, and I hit someonme's car but didn't tell them, and my mom replaced the jeep with this new fangled neo jeep.. lol don't even think that's real, but I was ticked cuz it was uglier than the jeep. Anways, we all go to the gym to meet our new coach and work out for the new official day of school, but being the name Coach Libby I dreamed he was a girl with white poofy hair. LoL But Jodi gathered all the cheerleaders in a corner and was trying to make us figure out our poses for our upcoming cheerleading pictures. LoL It was FUNNY!  But anyways... lol.... the story of Mikey and I's relationship is a little funny. We started going out in the 8th grade up until the 9th grade.... a full year. We broke up and didn't go out or anything til almost a full year..ish... and started going out again. One day I'll count up the days. It'll be worth it. :)  Well, I'm gonna go. Later! ~ChRiStIn

      Don't ask about the title, I went to type something in and a big list came up of all the things we've ever used as titles. I just used that one. LoL Sounds kool tho. Yesterday I went to Hurricane Harbor. It was fun! The cheerleaders went. Tori and Amy were already in Dallas and they thought that since they were already up there we could just meet them there. So we did. At first it was cloudy and we were all regretting coming. But it cleared up and it was soooo fun! I don't know if u know what I'm talking about, but there was this wire thingy, it's like a swing, they pull you up all the way to the top of the tower thing and you pull the string and you swing way over the wave pool. It was awesome. It was the first time I had ever done that before. Definately an experience! LoL  Well, I've been looking forward to today for awhile! Mikey and I are going on a date to W.F. to eat at Red Lobster's... watch The Notebook.... then walk around the mall. It's gonna be fun fun! :):):) We had to plan it on a day that he wasn't working. And the pool is closed today and tomorrow so woohoo! :D I just hope that I'm not supposed to be working tonight. LoL  Alrighty, I'm gonna go. Adios amigo!!!! ~ChRiStIn ElAiNe

Tomorrow is Bekah Bekah's birthday.. so if I don't get on here tomorrow, Happy 18th Birthday Bekah Bekah!!!!!!! :):) The other day Tori, Katy, and I loaded up in my Jeep and took off to P.K. It was so much fun! I love doing things on the moment like that. It just makes it even more fun. I got a better tan and everything! haha.. Well I'm gonna go..short today!

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been SO busy lately!!! A lot of things have come up. I went on vacation with&nbsp;my family to Port Aransas. It was quite an interesting vacation!&nbsp;Our car broke down on the way&nbsp;down there. LoL We had to get a tow&nbsp;truck and everything. Then we were stranded at our hotel/condo&nbsp;thing and we had to drive this&nbsp;"Dune Buggy" thing around.. it was like an extra long golf cart. It was hilarious. We went shopping....hung out on the beach... in the pool... watched the fireworks on the 4th... it was a lot of fun. I bought Mikey a little guitar thingy..&nbsp;I know what is' called but I don't know if I can spell it. LoL A&nbsp;Ukalayle...&nbsp;lol no&nbsp;clue. Maybe one day when I figure out how to put up pictures on here I'll show ya. LoL Well 4 days after I got home from that I left again for Fort Worth for another 3 day activity. It was a Youth Conference. Something my Church holds every summer. It was definately fun. More fun than all the ones I've been to before! Well, things are going good here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mikey and I are still great. I love him so much... and it's not just the lustful boyfriend/girlfriend type.. it's the best friend, no1 else like him love. :) I'm so grateful for him.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I need to start working out... running and stuff. If I don't, I am going to DIE in two-a-days. LoL They are just around the corner too! Our new coach, Coach Libby, had a couple of practices with us the other day. It was tiring, but it felt good to run and stuff. He's definately gonna keep us running and in shape for basketball and volleyball.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, the other day I was talking with one of my friends from Fort Worth, he's going to BYU.. that's where I have always wanted to go. I think about leaving right after school's out though, and it scares me. I don't wanna leave Cathryne and Nathan yet, they're still young! I wanna go to their basketball and volleyball games and their trackmeets. And my parents, it'd kill me to not have them around anymore! LoL So I think I'll stick around for awhile. :)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think I'm gonna go! Gotta get some stuff done today, maybe even some running! I've got volleyball games tonight at the G. Highschool! Ne1 who's interested needs to come watch! LoL AdIoS! ~ChRiStIn
