       You wore your smartest suit; flirted shamelessly with airline staff; inquired politely and knowingly about load levels; or even claimed a recent sports injury; and yet you're drinking cheap wine and choosing between chicken or beef at seat 58E.   Have you ever wondered just how the airlines decide whom to upgrade? Nowadays, is it still possible to smooth-talk your way into a better class?      Why an upgrade?    With perks such as free-flowing champagne, world-class cuisine, seats that recline into beds and cabin crews so charming and attentive that it's not hard to understand why there're so many people who'll try anything to get a free upgrade.    Urban Legends of Free Upgrades    We all have friends who brag 'techniques' and 'success' at getting upgraded (bumped up) for free. Being as cyclical as I am, I like to think they're just pure urban legends. Here're a few examples:   Check-in Timing - They say it's best if you check-in very early for your flight because there're more unallocated business or first class seats available.   But others recommend checking-in very late because if there're still empty seats then, the check-in agent may consider upgrading you, for free!   Dress Smart - Another common myth is that if you're smartly dressed and look the part, you're more likely to get an upgrade.   But increasingly, the 'genuine' first-class travelers dress casually, and only those seeking upgrades wear a suit and tie or the female equivalent.    Be Charming and Polite - Some people say if you can be both charming and polite, and pay plenty of compliments to airline staff, they may reward you with a free upgrade.    These 'techniques' might have worked in the past. But the truth is getting 'bumped up' isn't a popularity contest or a fashion parade.   Most airlines now have their own set of unpublicized rules for free upgrades, which leaves you wondering just how do they decide whom to upgrade, for free?      The Unpublicized Rules for Free Upgrades    Most airlines often overbook their flights to ensure a full load and last-minute cancellations. Therefore, you can argue complimentary upgrades are only a 'by-product' of their greed. Beyond that, some airlines don't want their passengers getting used to being moved up for free because they might hold a grudge when they're stuck in economy.   Different airlines have different set of rules. However, complimentary upgrades are generally awarded to people who are the most valuable to the airline, such as:  •	Frequent Fliers who hold the highest level of memberships of any rewards or loyalty programs; •	Passengers who pay full ticket fare;  •	Corporate travel planner or anyone who has direct dealings with the airline sales representatives; •	Friends, families and employees of the airline; •	Celebrities or well-known people.      Last Resort...   If you don't belong to any of above categories, the situation is not entirely hopeless. Follow these 6 strategies and get an upgrade without paying extra on your next flight:   Build good relationships with Travel Agents - Try asking your travel agent to add an 'OSI' (Other Significant Information) message to your PNR (booking record), such as 'CIP CEO Big Corp' (CIP = 'Commercially Important Passenger'). Then keep your fingers crossed and hope someone in the airline will see this tiny message if they're trying to look for passengers to upgrade.    Avoid Regular Business Hours - Saturdays, holidays, mid-day and late evenings are times when you won’t see as many business travelers. You'll have fewer competitions.    Travel on Your Birthday - If you're lucky, they may bump you up on your birthday.   Be Persistent - Ask everyone you see from check-in counters, boarding gate to inside the cabin. However, be subtle and discreet.   Get voluntarily bumped - Volunteer to give up your seat in oversold situations; not only you may get a compensation, you may end up getting upgraded on the next flight out.   When On-board - If you've a genuine problem and I do mean 'genuine', because there's nothing you say to do that hasn't been tried before, try asking a cabin crew discreetly if there's any chance of a courtesy upgrade as a quick and easy solution. Please note that being a 'Diva' on-board will get you no where.    If none of these tips have helped you to get a free upgrade, you can always buy your way to a better class or use air-miles to upgrade, instead of getting it free just for being you. Good luck.

       Don't you love loyalty cards, frequent flyer's perks and access to restricted VIP lounges? Taking that concept a giant step forward, the Thai Government in November 2003, launched the Thailand Elite Card, the world's first "Country Membership Club".   Membership is issued only by invitation; celebrities, businessmen and luxury travelers are all being targeted as potential "Elite Tourists", enjoying an array of benefits and privileges across Thailand.    No longer a haven for scruffy backpackers holidaying on the cheap, Thailand is shifting its focus to luxury travelers who have high-spending power.        Membership Benefits    Thailand Elite offers its members VIP treatment for life, including:   o	Fast-track passage through immigration, customs, luggage pick-up and check-in; o	5-year multiple-entry tourist visa, renewable every 5 years; o	Right to purchase land in Thailand; o	Limousine transfers; o	Heavy discounts with Thai Airways International; o	Free daily Thai massage; o	Waiver of green fees and full access to more than 25 world-class golf courses across Thailand; o	Free medical check-up at 14 selected hospitals and clinics; o	Pre-negotiated discount access to Thailand's luxury hotels, resorts, restaurants, etc; o	24-hour concierge.       Membership Fees    Currently, it costs US$25,650 (1 million Baht) for a personal membership and US$51,300 (2 million Baht) for a corporate membership.    Although the website www.thailandelite.com suggests memberships are by invitations only, actually, anyone who has 1 million Baht to spare are welcome to join, though the Thai authority has the right to refuse applications.        It's a Good Idea…     Tourism is a major source of income for Thailand, contributing more than 6 percent of economic output.    With the help of the Elite Card, the Thai Government expects they can generate even more income from the tourism industry to help further strengthen and sustain the Thai Economy as a whole.        but Bad Executions?    Despite having massive publicities and giving away complimentary cards to the likes of David Beckham and Posh Spice, only 500 Elite Cards have been sold, a far cry from the Thai government’s ambitious target of 1 million cards.    In response to the poor card sales, Prime Minister Thaksin is planning to double the cost of the Elite card from 1 million Baht to 2 million Baht, a strategy which I find confusing. Under normal circumstances, the way to increase sales is to lower prices, not double them.    What's even more confusing is, undaunted by the failure of the Elite Card, the card company plans to offer a "Super Elite Card" for the super rich, paying a membership fee that could be as high as US$100,000 (Bt39 million).        Thailand Elite Might Be Illegal?    The Elite cardholders are suggested to be granted the right to buy land in Thailand. However, under the current land laws, foreigners are forbidden to have any direct or in-direct land ownership in Thailand, even with an Elite card.    The Elite Card Company - a state-owned limited company, came up with a "cunning" plan in order to avoid legal issues. The card company has agreed to buy land and hold the ownership title on behalf of the cardholders, whom will have full right to access and use the land.    Giving the poor reception of the Elite Card, there's always a possibility for the card company to go bankrupt. So, what happens to the company's assets then? My guess is that all assets, including the land which were paid by cardholders, will end up going to the creditors, not to the cardholders.   The Thailand Elite Card is all about style and offers nothing in substance. But it’s a novel idea though.

       Dr. Wei Siang Yu, also know as Singapore's "Dr. Love" shot to the spotlight last year when he launched "Love Boat", a package holiday designed to set couples in the mood for loveÂ and baby-making.    Apart from "Love Boat", Dr. Wei also gained a following hosting a radio show called "Sex in the Air", a name with a hint of irony as the hit TV series "Sex and the City" is banned in Singapore.    In 2004, Dr. Wei is starting a love plane; a midnight TV talk show featuring bathtub tutorials; and a reality TV show where 10 couples of different nationalities will compete to be the first to conceive.    Crazy as it may sound, the Singapore government, known for its straight censorship laws, actually approves and supports Dr. Wei's "sex tourism" initiatives, for a reason.         The Love Boat      The Singapore government is alarmed over the trend of couples marrying later and having fewer babies. In the long term, SingaporeÂs population will become significantly older, resulting in higher social welfare costs and lower productivity.    In response, the government has set up numerous campaigns and policies to encourage its citizens to pair up and have babies.    Pro-family initiatives have included everything from subsidizing candlelit dinners on ValentineÂs Day and speed-dating, to providing financial incentives that came to be known as a "baby bonus".    Despite the government's effort, the fertility-level continues to fall. Singapore has turned to Dr. Wei for help.   ÂEverything canÂt be solved via national policiesÂ Money canÂt resolve everything. We must also take into consideration peopleÂs feelings and emotions,Â said Dr. Wei.   Before setting sail, on the "Love Boat" program, couples get fertility seminars on pre-pregnancy planning, hormonal wellness and sexual health, supported by the Singapore Planned Parenthood Association.   Couples are then ferried to a luxurious Indonesian holiday resort and experience everything from massages and mood-setting music to aromatherapy and aphrodisiac meals. They'll even have an on-site sex counselor, whom they can approach or consult via SMS text-messages.   These trips from Singapore are expected to soon expand to Japan, which is also facing the dangrayinga greying population; as well as China, where affluent mainland Chinese may want to have "quality" babies since they're restricted by the "one child" policy.   But the baby-making holiday doesn't come cheap. Would-be-parents fork out as much as SG $1,000, with no refund if the holiday produces no babies.       Love Airways    Followed by the great reception of "Love Boat", Dr. Wei is taking the concept to the air, partnering with a regional airline.   'Most major regional airlines are interested in the idea, and at least one will be rolling the package out from Singapore in the second half of 2004,' said Dr Wei, without yet identifying the airline.    However, those hoping to join the Mile-High Club will be disappointed, for now at least. Beds won't be available on-board yet, as the initial destinations such as Phuket, Hua Hin, Krabi, and Bali, where it only takes 2-3 hours to get to.    "Love Airways" packages will start from SG $1,000 (US$570) per person, which is estimated to bring in an annual revenue of US$2 million to US$3 million for Dr. Wei's company.      Doctor Who?     In 2001, Dr. Wei made headlines when his "Bio-communication" company Meggpower.com, introduced a service to alert women ahead of their ovulation through text-messages or e-mails, encouraging them to make love during their optimal period for conceiving.    Wei, 36, a flamboyant, Australian-educated doctor, earned the nickname "Dr. Love" from his unconventional approach to promote sex and fertility.   Despite being an excellent self-promoter, the effort bringing Singaporeans together, and having a successful career, Dr. Love remains single.
