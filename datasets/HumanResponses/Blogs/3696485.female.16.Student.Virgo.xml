						   Flannery O'Connor's novel  Wise Blood  captures the struggle both for and against faith. Its protagonist, Hazel Motes, epitomizes this struggle when he sets up The Church Without Christ while pursuing a seemingly blinded preacher and his daughter. As this happens, he meets Enoch Emery, whose faith is driven primarily through intuition and his "wise blood."  Hazel Motes's views change throughout the story. When he sets up his church (that consists of him), it is almost as if he is preaching athiesm in order to attract the attention of the preacher. At least, this is the appearance of his preaching when he begins. Still, as he preaches, it changes, showing his continual belief in a god. He preaches that "What you need is something to take the place of Jesus, something that would speak plain. The Church Without Christ don't have a Jesus but it needs one! It needs a new jesus! It needs one that's all man, without blood to waste, and it needs one that don't look like any other man so you'll look at him."  As the story progresses, however, even this belief becomes disillusioned. The incident of the police officer pushing his car over the embankment and commenting that "Them that don't have a car don't need a license" serves both as a microcosm and as a turning point in this story. Before this, he proposed to have a church with no faith, and after this, he has faith, but no church.  The evidence of his faith is far more subtle than it was before. Earlier in the story, he remarks that he is "clean" because Jesus never existed, and that if Jesus had existed, he would not be clean. Near the end of the story, he mentions that he keeps rocks in his shoes and wears barbed wire to get clean.  Furthermore, his act of self imposed blindness serves as a parallel with the preacher who lost faith and ended up not blinding himself. He then remarks that "if there's no bottom in your eyes, they hold more." It is almost as if at the end of the story, he becomes the prophet that he was striving to be throughout the story, only he no longer has the will to preach.  There's so much more about this story that I could talk about, such as his rejection of Enoch Emery's replacement Jesus (the mumified man from the zoo) and Hazel Mote's faith in his broken down car. I could talk about how Enoch changes, or how Hazel interacts with Lily Sabbath. I could talk about Mrs Flood, Hazel's land lady. I could talk about when Enoch steals the gorilla suit. Still, I have to leave soon, so I probably won't delve into these things. This story was amazing and well written, and I would like to discuss it with someone.

						   I don't know. I guess that is the conclusion of this post. The truth is that I'm simply pondering something that is not really going to change, and that I wouldn't change. I really do like my friends. I like talking to them. I like interacting with them. I like having someone to talk to.  The thing is that I can't talk about everything with them. Namely, I can't talk about politics or philosophy. The reason for this is that 1)they don't know much about these topics and 2)they aren't really interested in them. This is fine, except that I feel as if I'm leading two lives. I can talk to certain friends who live out of town about those subjects, and I do so regularly. Its just that I can't talk to them about it when I'm thinking about it.  For instance, today I had been reading the news. I read the newspaper pretty regularly, but when I read the news online, its because I'm thinking about stuff. I proceeded to start talking about it with my friend, and then I realized that she hated it. We don't agree on politics. We never have, and unless she has some radical change in her life, we never will. Still, the fact that we couldn't even discuss it without her breaking into hives (she just hates talking about it, it isn't just me) bothered me.   In other news, I tried to find a job at a bookstore for the school year, and I failed miserably. Apparently, most of the bookstores aren't really interested in part time help. Oh well. At least I'll still have time for speech and debate...  I'm currently avoiding my summer reading (still) and am reading  Wise Blood  by Flannory O'Connor. Its good. I like how she writes; its very concise, and yet, it manages to capture the thought process of the narrator in third person. Yay for third person limited!

						   This is a question whose answer we will never discover. I haven't been posting the past few days because I find it too much fun to stare at computer screens without producing anything productive. On a more serious note, here is what I've really been doing.  I went shopping with my aunt the other day. I love my aunt. She's a really nice and interesting person, and I've always been friends with her. We like talking, and we rarely get together. Still, I HATE shopping. That is the biggest understatement ever. She likes shopping, so we go shopping, and I try to act happy. This is made about ten thousand billion times more problematic because I don't like dresses and I don't like skirts. Hell, I don't even like fitted T-shirts.  I suppose I should be grateful because I won't have to go shopping for the next year and a half (fancy clothing lasts me a really long time but my parents eventually force me to go). Still, I can't help but feel guilty. She's spending money on me, and I'm not grateful enough.  The thing is that I don't wear anything remarkable. I've lived in jeans and boy t-shirts (and shorts when the weather forces me) for two years, and I've no intention to change that right now. Fitted clothing (and sometimes bright colors) make me feel as if I'm exposed. I envy guys baggy pants. This may stem from a subconcious feeling of inferiority when it comes to appearance, but I doubt it. I feel fine about my appearance most of the time.   More likely, it is intertwined with my wanting to hide and avoid being noticed. This is ironic because I can be so loud and active within a classroom. Still, I really don't like being noticed. Throughout middle school, I had wanted to be a hermit when I grew up. I no longer am that extreme but that part of me is still there.  Ok, now it is for the incessant book talk. Today and yesterday, I read three plays by Oscar Wilde. "The Importance of Being Earnest,""Lady Windmere's Fan," and "Solme." Wilde is a master at witty dialogue, but his attempts at social commentary are rather lukewarm. I really loved  A Picture of Dorian Gray  and I do love his plays, but his plays are pretty light reading.  I have read 6 chapters of  In the Shadow of Man  by Jane Goodall. Its good, but I had put it off in favor of Wilde. As for  A People's History of the United States , I'll eventually have to read it, but until I finish other books, its unlikely that I will.

						   "The more patriotic the name, the more fascist the policy. Soon the government will announce operation "Apple Pie" which will allow national guardsmen to shoot American citizens whenever they feel like it." Hangly Man (someone from the internet whom I have never contacted, but whose quote was lying around)  It's too damn true and its scary. "No Child Left Behind" "The Patriot Act" "Operation Iraqi Freedom" Does anything ever just have a neutral name? Obviously, they wouldn't name it "Flaming Piece of Shit That Everyone Should Vote Against if They Are Slightly Decent" but the fact that every name is so charged really gets on my nerves. This was bothering me during student congress because I was surrounded by conservatives. Not only did I have to argue against six sevenths of the room, but I had to argue against names that affect people in a subtle manner. It isn't as if anyone would take the name at face value, but when you are arguing against something like that, you are immediately put on the defensive. Not only are you arguing why the bill is bad, but you're arguing why you aren't bad. I HATE THAT. One day, I'm going to write a bill for student congress that will be named "The American Act" and we shall see how well that gets passed...I'll probably make it outlaw something ridiculous. Any good ideas for what this bill, tell me.  I'm only writing right now because I'm bored, so I'm going to go play minesweeper. My record on expert is 110 seconds, but I shall improve.

						   My nose is very runny, and I'm about to sneeze, and I HATE pollen and dust and everything else that makes my nose run ridiculously. My kitten is playing with wires, and my other cat is absolutely filthy. I think she likes rolling in dirt and grease, because every time I turn around, she has another layer on her, and since she has white fur, it is really really gross looking. At least Socrates doesn't have such a dramatic change when he gets dirty (and I'm sure he is). My three cats are Snowy, Shadow, and Socrates. Snowy and Shadow were named by my sister, and they are older than Socrates, who is my special cat. The other two sleep in my sister's room, but Socrates sticks with me. Shadow is really crazy and hyper, and Snowy is reclusive and hides under things whenever anyone comes near, but Socrates thinks that he's human. Yes, I am a dork and talk about my cats too much. Any maternal instinct I have is completely devoted to cats (I certainly don't like human children, with a few exceptions, I get really annoyed with little kids after five or ten minutes).   Summer is boring. With the exception of camp (which is in itself more than an exception and allows summer to be justified) I would rather that school continued. I haven't felt like that before, but I feel it now. I like my school. I like learning. I like most of my teachers. The ones I don't like, I can still survive because I know that I'm going to a better class in an hour. Some of the teachers I think are bad teachers are still good people. I think that's an important distinction because far too often, people judge the teacher on their skill and not for them as a whole.   My french teacher was in the peace corp, was really involved in the civil rights movement, is a retired hippie with more ideas and knowledge than a lot of people I know. He is also a terrible teacher because he likes to talk about french speaking africa (when he was in the peace corp) and when he was biking around france in college instead of about the subjunctive tense. He also feels bad giving bad grades on essays because when someone makes an effort, he doesn't like to discourage them. My math teacher this year was a nun (yes, in a public school) who goes to protest the school of the americas every year and is an avid pacifist. I've never seen her  ever  condemn anyone. We discuss fairness issues and current events on fridays. She loves abstract math, and talks about proofs as if they are flowers or children. She knows what she's talking about, and she can teach well, but she allows too much to go on in her class behind her back, and she isn't afraid to fail a student who doesn't do the work.  I've only had one truly terrible teacher, both in personality and in teaching methods. Ever. Hew as my english teacher this year, and he talked to us as if we were inantimate objects. I read from the textbook and tested us on the history instead of the literature. (History is important, but by that, I mean the summaries in our literature book.) Not only that, but he got the history wrong. He used  A Doll's House  as an example of enlightenment thought. There are elements of that; however, considering that that play was from a later time period and it was an example of feminism, this is a really bad example. I told him on the last day before exams that he wasted my time, and he didn't understand what I said. Whats more, after I battled him all that semester (we had 3 english teachers this year) he gave me the award for the class. I wanted to tear it apart. It was as if I got an award in PE.  Wow, I've rambled about my teachers, which is...ok, I guess. Maybe I don't have much else to talk about. I think I'll get off and go read. Still reading  A People's History of the United States . Damn I want it to be over.

						   Hi, well here it is. 'Tis inspired by someone who convinced me that it is not something terrible and scary. Actually, the real reason I'm writing this is that I realized that I spend more time on the computer than I do anything else, so I might at least devote some of my time to something that I can look back on.  The thing is that I do not want this to turn out angst ridden like most blogs I have seen tend to do. I do not want this to become a history of my personal life. Neither of those things really interest me that much because honestly, I'm a pretty boring person. I am not bad off, and I have no real reason to complain bitterly. So....  I will write about other stuff. I will write about thoughts, ideas, and whatever is interesting me at the moment. I will not delve excessively in the real world if I can help it. Ok, so I might write about the real world if it affects my emotions or thoughts in a significant way. I might. (This means that I most probably will, and that I am quite likely to go back on whatever I said here)  Right now, I am thinking about books. After all, it   is   summer, so I have enough time to read. I shall have an ongoing log of the books I read. I just finished reading  L'Etranger  (the stranger) in french. It was good, and I fully intend to read it again in english so I can assure myself that I understand it. Existentialism is fun.   Right now, I am reading  A People's History of the United States  by Howard Zinn. It is pretty good; I had seen it referenced in a few other things I was reading, and I've heard people talk about it. So when I saw it on the list of choices for school, I chose it. Still, I really am not that interested in American History. I would much rather be reading something that is either fiction or about somewhere or something else. This is how I feel about US history most of the time. I mean, I'm outraged by the injustice and interested in innovations, and I know that it is pretty important if I'm to understand the US as it is today, but it simply doesn't interest me as much as other places. At school, I'm taking Russian history along with US history so I can have something that is more interesting.   After that, I will read  In the Shadow of Man  by Jane Goodall, and then, I will write a report on it. Thats for Bio 2, but I'm actually interested in it. I have heard much of Jane Goodall, and it will be interesting to see what she has to say. Then, all my required reading will be done, and I can read whatever else I want. Dunno what that will be quite yet, but I'm sure it will be something fun. My reading has been getting progressively less and less light, and with the exception of  Life of Pi , I have not read anything really mainstream in a while. Well, no, I did read  Running Away on a Fast Camel  by Louise Rennison a couple weeks ago. Somehow, I get the feeling that I will be correcting myself here.  Actually, I do know what that might be. I probably will read  The Da Vinci Code  even though I hear it is pop history ridden with conspiracy theories. Everyone around me has read it, and I'm beginning to feel left out (the reason I have read Harry Potter). After that, I'll probably find something a bit more fun, but who knows.  Perhaps more writing will come in the future

						   I am at TIP. HOORAY. Ok, so politics and economics has been ok (even though I miss consensus and am annoyed with certain people in my class). Currently, we are learning about how the global economy works, and since I do not fully understand it quite yet, I will post on that topic later. What I can say is that I've achieved a better understanding of how globalization has become the main global system. I've also learned how the internet and increased technology has factored into democratizing information and decisions.  I love seeing my friends. Its a lot different here; I'm not afraid of talking about stuff, and I don't have to worry about my family. I'll talk about this more later, but since I'm in the library and will have to leave soon, I think I'll do some other stuff (like email my parents). Oh well...

						   I've never had cramps during my period before. Never. For me, my uterus was always an afterthought, an minor inconvenience, a mark on my underwear that would wash out in the sink if I caught it early enough. Thats not how it feels now. It isn't unbearable, but it is persistant. I feel like my lower body is being squeezed too tightly, like its all constricted inside. I try lying down and all it does is make me bored and uncomfortable. I try ignoring it, and it still persists. Its like an ugly secret that won't go away, and since I don't believe in complaining to any person (computers don't count), I just keep thinking about it.  I can see how miserable it would be for people not to believe you. My neighbor (who's in her mid fourties) grew up at the time when people were still insisting that menstruel cramps were physcological. Every month, she got piercing cramps that kept her in bed for at least two days. Her parents took her to the doctor, who told them that she was an artistic type, prone to such problems. That's terrible! I mean, if someone were to tell me that my cramps weren't real, I'd probably want to be very violent.  Still, I can see how easy it would be to deny. I never thought other women were faking cramps, but I didn't feel that bad for them. It had never bothered  me  so I didn't really think about them as that terrible. I think thats a very human tendency to ignore what doesn't affect one's self. Still, it's one that must be fought. Because even if I don't get confined to a bed two days out of a month, my neighbor still gets that bad, even after two kids. Even if mine aren't that bad, someone else's are worse. Even if I never felt anything, someone else did.

						   I'm still reading  Little, Big  by John Crowley. It really is superb, but the writing is so intense and dense that it's been taking me a while. Here's an excerpt from "Suppose One Were a Fish" (my favorite part)   Of course (the sutters bean to drift closed again) it was possible to imagine he was one of them, himself a secret-keeper, curse-maker, malign manipulator; an eternal wizard intelligence housed for its own subtle purposes in a common fish. Eternal: suppose it to be so: cetainley he has lived forever or nearly, has survived into this present time (supposing (drifting deeper)) this to be the present time); he has not expired at a fish's age, or even at a prince's. It seems to him that he extends backwards (or is it forewards?) without beginning (or is it end?) and he can't just now remember whether the great tales and plots which he supposes he knows and forever broods on lie in the to-come or lie dead in the has-been. But then suppose thats how secrets are kept, and age-long tales remembered, and unbreakable curses made too....   This chapter is amazing because it is told from the (third person limited) view of an enchanted trout who can only remember his past humanity when he is asleep. Those who turned him into a trout and imprisoned him in a barren lake denied him his memories, and by doing so, erased his knowledge of why he was there. This chapter really blew my mind, but there are so many parts like that... Here's how that chapter ends.   Only suppose this man imagines remembering, imagines his only and final memory to be (the rest, all the rest, is supposition) the awful strangulated gaspin in deadly waterlessness, the sudden fusing of arms and legs, the twisting in air (air!) and then the horrible relief of the plunge into cold, sweet water where he ought to be-must now be forever.  And suppose he cannot now remember  why  it happened: only supposes, dreamin, that it did.   What was it he did to hurt you so?  Was it only that the Tale required some go-between, some  maquereau , and he came close enough to be seized?  Why can't I remember my sin?   I don't know what else to talk about today, all I know is that I'm getting ready to go to TIP. I'm stopping by in Atlanta, and I tried to email some friends to see if we could meet up, but none of them answered me back yet. Oh well, maybe they will soon...  Really, I can't wait for TIP. It is much more like home that home actually is. Its a shame I can only go this last year... More later, I just wanted to have quotes from  Little, Big  before I left.

						   Ok, I took time out from  Little, Big  to read  The Wee Free Men  by Terry Pratchett. Its a lighter read, and I had finished it by 5 that night. Now, I'm going to be getting back to  Little, Big  It really is a fantastic book. The writing is superb, and the story is interesting. Its just that...I feel compelled to put it down every five pages or so because it has so many sections. Its strange...  Tommorrow is the Fourth of July, which is Smay and Richard's birthdays. That is why I am happy. NOT because I am patriotic in any way. Well, I could be...if I knew what patriotism was. As far as I can tell, everyone has a different definition of it, and uses that definition to their advantage. I refuse to be part of any label that I cannot define. I am a feminist. I am left leaning politically. I am a tenative athiest. I am a reader.  TIP is a week away tommorrow. I can't wait! I'm really looking foreward to it, and mom's having me start preparing already, so I can feel it coming. Yay!

						   Maybe its just a writer's thing, but I hate titles. They're lame and stupid and have to be changed ten thousand times because no one ever thinks they're appropriate.   So, moving on... I finished  In the Shadow of Man  by Jane Goodall a few days ago. I really liked it, but I'm having trouble bringing myself to write the report on it. Right now, I'm reading  Little, Big  by John Crowley because I can't bring myself to start  A People's History of the United States  by Howard Zinn back up. Its just a little too much socialism and american history for me.   Little, Big  is amazing. I love the way he writes. He manages to make everything sound elegant and beautiful. I also like that he combines magic and modern day without making it seem cheesy. There's this one section called "Suppose one were a Fish", and every time I read it (I've reread this part several times because its amazing) I get shivers. I had started reading it last year at the suggestion of a friend, but after summer reading got evil, I had to put it aside. I'm glad I picked it up, though, because its amazing.  All my friends are gone. Smay's in europe have a super fabulous time. The twins (though they'd kill me if I said "the twins" in front of them) are in Florida. My other friends have jobs and family obligations. Boredom is really consuming.  Still, I did see Farenheight 911 the other day. I don't trust Michael Moore as far as information goes (he really isn't that accurate), but he's definately hilarious, and he makes some good points. I like the part where he tries to get congressmen to enlist their children in the military. Also, the part where he reads the Patriot Act in front of the Capitol is great.   I haven't been writing anything. I thought I was going to be writing another long story, maybe shoot for a novel, but I just haven't been doing it. I've been really lazy, and I need to get back into it. Oh well.

						   Thats the gist of what my friend just said. True, I was not having the best time in my life. True, I probably could have been more talkative if I had put in an effort. STILL, that is no reason to assume that I had a bad time!  I went out with two of my friends for the first time in a few weeks (we were finally all in the same place at the same time!). Unfortunately, three other people from their school came along. Not that I don't like them...I just don't know them. So, they all talked about school stuff coming up...and I sat there. Smay kept looking at me and saying "talk!", but really, I didn't know what to talk about, and no one was really that interested in listening anyway.  So everyone was going to go back to Sarah's afterwards, and Smay goes "You can go home if you want, I don't really care since you didn't have any fun anyway". WHO THE HELL SAYS I HAD NO FUN. I wanted to fucking see them! I wanted to! I'm tired of being the only one sitting at home on the fucking computer because no one else wants to talk to me! I'm tired of it, and if that means I need to learn how to talk fluff, or learn how to sit there being quiet, I'll fucking do it.  In truth, it was ok. I felt kind of left out, but I do regret going home. Everyone else is heading to Sarah's, where they'll all do exactly the same thing, and it would have been no more fun to go there, but I still regret it.  So the question I have to ask myself is...is it better to have a kind of unfun time with friends or a boring time alone?  The answer? I just don't know right now.

						   And I'm too lazy to retype it, so bah. I've read  The Lexus and the Olive Tree  by Thomas Friedman in its entirety. It is a book about globalization and its benefits and what must be done to make it better. Right now, I'm reading  Madame Secretary  by Madeleine Albright. 'Tis quite good, and it is interesting to hear her recount what happened during the Rwandan Genocide. What struck me was that she asserted that they had very little information at the time of what  exactly  was happening. Is that true? Hopefully. I don't want to think about how upsetting it would be to know that policy makers knew all this and did nothing.  The funny thing about Madeleine Albright is that she looks just like my grandmother. They look so similar that my brother commented on it when my book was just laying on the table. Apparently, they even walked the same before Bubbie started having back problems.  Ok, right now my room is a mess and school is about to start. I have to do all these assignments for NOCCA, and 'tis annoying because it all seems to be sneaking up on me.  I'm sick of writing for now, so I'm going to go.  Farethewell...

						   I'm at Dad's house again, and wow, what an adjustment. Its always when I go there after being at mom's or away for a while. The thing is that he always expects me to act in certain ways, and I'm never good at being that person. See, Dad (and Janie) tend to value appearances much more than sincerity or for that matter, reality. They're the type who like it when someone looks smart more than when they really are smart.  I mean, they're nice to me (at least right now) because I'm going along with what they say. It's when I disagree, or when I don't want to do what they tell me that they freak out...  Anyways, I'm reading  The Truth  by Terry Pratchett. T'is a very funny diskworld novel about the beginnings of a newspaper in Ankh Morpork. There are so many good quotes...I'll put some up later (or not, they might float off into space with the EE Cummings poems I was going to post). The best parts involve the vampire photographer. He takes a picture, then because of the flash, rolls around screaming in pain and turns into dust. Then he recovers and does it again...bwa ha ha.  After this, I really will have to read the last of my poetry books.  The Ape Woman Story  actually looks pretty good...its just that after the  Girls on the Run  fiasco, I went into poetry overload and needed to recover with some witty prose. Anyways, I'm gonna go read some more. I'll post again soon...

						   I love The Phantom of the Opera. I do. I've listened to the sound track since I was six or so. My dad used to tell me the story when we were in the car. I loved the music, and when my mom took me to see the musical...well, it was amazing. Then I read the book, and that was amazing too. Then I saw the musical again. Yeah, I'm listening to "Down Once More" right now (the last scene, which is fantastic and amazing and I lack enough adjectives to describe it)  The story always appealed to me. The phantom is a repulsive character, especially in the book. He is hideous, both in body and in personality. The personality part is skimmed over in the musical, but he was basically a psycopathic murderer. His only redemption was that he loved music...and Christine. In a love that verged on stalkeresque, he loved Chrisitine, and he built up her voice and essentially coerced the opera house into letting her sing. THEN, he discovers that she had fallen in love with her childhood friend, Raoul, and he kidnaps Christine. He gives her a choice: marry him, or he'll blow up the opera house with everyone in it (yeah, this is very stalkerish and it sounds worse than I thought). Then, Raoul shows up and a lot of stuff happens, and Erik (the phantom) lets Christine and Raoul go...  I always thought that the Phantom should have killed Raoul. Ok, yes, I was a strange child, but I have always sympathized primarily with Erik. I always though that Christine was mean, and that Raoul was a prick. (especially in the musical...the book was different). I always thought it was unfair that in the end, Erik sat alone and dying in the Opera House basement, singing to himself.  The thing was, he did all the crazy and scary stuff because he really did love Christine. At the end of the book, when he's talking to the Persian and saying how he's ready to die, I cried. You see, in the book, he lets Christine and Raoul go after she kisses his forehead and promises that she'll really marry him (and not kill herself) if he'll let Raoul go.  It seems to me that in a way, everyone is kind of like Erik. I mean, a lot of his problems stemmed from how convinced he was that he couldn't be accepted. This made him afraid of really talking to Christine (I mean, who ever falls for the "Angel of Music"). He was capable of cruelty and terribleness and beauty. He did have beauty. His opera (at least in the book) was supposed to be fantastic, but was lost when the the basement of the opera house flooded. And he was willing to give up everything for Christine.  Well, its obvious that I'm biased. If I were Christine, I would have married the Phantom. Anyways, I'll just go off humming "Music of the Night" and be done with it.

						   Yes, this is time to explain how I am not very good with poetry. I've read the book of E.E. Cummings poetry, and its great. Even  I can see that. Still, I probably understood about 3/8ths of it for sure. Now, I'm reading this book by John Ashbery, and it is WAY too confusing. Its called  Girls on the Run , and I really don't understand ANY of it. Well, at least I get to read  The Ape Woman Story  (a book of poetry by Nancy Harris) afterwards. I read the first poem, and I like her a lot more.  I really don't know why I'm doing the poetry workshop. Well, yes I do. You see, I like nocca. I like reading the stuff they give me. I love the atmosphere. I love learning there. I'd rather be taking Fiction, but if they make me take poetry instead, I'll take it if it means I can keep going. Thats just how I am. Still, the next challenge will be to see if...I can learn to understand and *gasp* write poetry. We shall see.

						   Yeah, the title sums up the contents of this post...I'm reading  Girls on the Run  by John Ashbery. Its a very strange book of poems, and it is confusing me right now.  I've finished the book of poems E.E. Cummings  We're fostering kittens right now. You (being the void that I write to) see, if a pregnant cat or very young kittens get taken to a shelter, they have to put them down because young kittens' immune systems can't handle so many other cats. There's this organization in my area called Friends of Jefferson Animal Shelter that works with the shelter to foster out pregnant cats and kittens. Here's their website  urlLink http://www.petfinder.com/shelters/fjas.html  .  Right now, we're taking care of a cat and her six kittens while the real person fostering them goes on vacation. The kittens (and the mom) are adorable, but I feel bad for the mom. She is so damn skinny, its a wonder she moves around. When you pet her, you can feel her spine and hips. The sad part is she probably won't start gaining weight until after the kittens stop nursing, and since they're four weeks old, that may not be for a while.  I'll try to put up pictures of the kittens later...

						   I emailed Amnesty International just now. I must say that I don't understand. I mean, I understand the reasons, and I understand that politics are involved. I understand that countries are obligated to respond to genocide and don't want AI saying its one. I understand that AI doesn't want to lost credibility. I understand all that.  What I don't understand is how AI could do this. I don't understand how people can make this decisions without hating themselves. People are being killed, and no one is doing anything. Yeah, right. Threaten sanctions. We don't fucking trade with Sudan anyway, what good will that do? If anything, it'll block aid, and thats even worse. There'll be a famine in Darfur soon because the Janjawid militia is burning crops and the region is subsitence farming.  I can understand why countries are avoiding labelling it a genocide. I hate it, but I can understand it. What I cannot understand is how AI is going along with this. Why aren't they speaking out? I thought these were the people who devoted their lives to fighting for human rights. I thought that they would do better.  This makes me sad.

						   Ok, I'm going to post the paper I got to write at TIP. Basically, it's an analysis of what's happening in Darfur, Sudan right now. It is slightly outdated because Congress recently defined the crisis as a genocide, but overall, the analysis is up to date.  It disturbs me that someone, much less the entire world, would ignore this. The feeling I have isn't logical, and it isn't nice, and all I can think is that it shows that complacency is one of humanitys greatest faults. Rwanda shouldn't happen again. Genocide is genocide, and using other words to make it sound better is NOT acceptable. The biggest dissapointment in this whole thing is that even Amnesty International is afraid to call it a genocide. Everyone's afraid. People are dying, and everyone's too afraid to do something. It isn't fair.  Here's my paper...   Darfur: Genocide or Ethnic Cleansing?

						   I am back from TIP now. It was my last time going, and I already miss it. The thing is that it hasn't sunk in yet. I've always wanted to stay there, but I don't fully realize right now that I'll never be able to go back. I've always hated change (probably the product of having divorced parents), and it bothers me that I won't be able to recreate TIP. I loved it (and still love it) there.  While I was there, I finished  Little. Big.  It really is quite fantastic. I read a sizable amount (ok, only a chapter or two...) outloud to my roommate because it was far too fantastic to keep quiet. After I finished that, I read  The Gate to Women's Country , a mediocre book I picked up from the free books pile at TIP. It was an ok examination of gender roles, but the dialogue was completely unrealistic and some of the descriptions were pretty cheesy.  I have to read three poetry books for NOCCA, so I'm halfway through  100 Selected Poems  by EE Cummings. He really is fantastic. I'll probably post a poem or two by him as examples, but not right now because I am lazy and do not feel like choosing them. Also, I have to write three poems before class starts. I've got one and a half, so that third one will just have to come quick (one is a response to  Nostromo  where I address Linda and the other is a piece of crap that I wrote at midnight when I found out that I needed to write three poems).  Alright, I'm tired(ish) and need to read. I'll write more later.
