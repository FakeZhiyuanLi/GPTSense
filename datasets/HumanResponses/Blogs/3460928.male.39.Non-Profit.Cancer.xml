      I recently watched the very well done "Adaptation" movie with Nicholas Cage. The movie is a about the quest for beauty , passion, change, and other deeply basic human needs. The movie  manages to entertain with its great dialog and interesting characters along with touch you very deeply... . I would watch it again. Brian Cox was brilliant...  Anyhow.. Darwin was a chief symbol in the movie. I am a Christian so therefore I believe in design, purpose and creation. Darwins dominant presence in the movie was sort of disturbing to me because I basically see a contradiction. How can a piece of art touting value in beauty, the human soul, relationships,  quest for meaning... use an underlying theme of natural selection to anchor its themes. The question is,  if Darwins 19th century "science" theory is true and the creative force behind life is a magical force called chance (though chance is not a force) , natural selection in a process that is violent , bloody in both tooth and nail who cares about a ghost orchid?   I know that if I was an intellectual atheist if I had to produce a rational explanation for life that Darwinism would not even be close to my conclusion .

      Wow, I am now a blogger! Nothing much to offer the world but I would like to use this as sort of a selfish way to get things out of my head and out into open air....I want to make the point (to my self) that I actually realize that writing is far from any

      Well, Im off with my daughter to the courthouse. These have not been normal family activites these past months. I am not sure but words like "daddy Im seeing things" were never the kind of loving statements you expect to hear from one of your darlings. Whitney is an extrordinary women with some fantastic human qualities that make her one of the coolest people to hang out with. On the other hand she has some demons that want to hang out with her too. These demons are trying to destroy her (more to come..her she comes staggering down the stairs.

      Well lets see, Bubba began his masterful journey of life back in 1965. If you scan the 1965 newspapers and cull through the turmoil that plaqued our country (the world for that matter) you will be able to pin point exactly the day of his screamingly wicked birth. It was the, the only day during the crazy sixty's where ever (to be continued)

      Okay , so I want to introduce you to a man I know only as bubba. Well, I also know him as dp, ballflamer, doody and donny but thats besides the point. For all practical purposes I only know him as bubba. Iâ€™m not sure why I feel like that is a point to keep cramming down your throat because its simply not relevant ..or is it? This is not an article with only poorly written words, incomplete sentences and a subject that no one cares about but this is about a fellow that I only know as bubba. Bubba is perhaps the quintessential cosmonaut of the post french renaissance era..of course I do not really know what that means , it probably does not mean anything but if you say it real fast over and over it sounds quite insightful. Okay Im sticking to it,  if there ever was a  quentessential cosmonaut of the post french renaissance  era it would be Bubba,  CPFRE for short. Bubba the CPFRE! Anyhow, I find it hard to really begin this piece because mere writing will not accomplish for you what I would like to accomplish for you. That is to say I would like to open you up to a man that will not only fascinate you , confound you, botox you, but will also meld with your inner being. A full introduction would smite you with sheer unbelief. For this man that I call bubba, the man I know and lovea lives in a world that mere mortals only dream about. Yes, its a make believe world that includes some really scary morphed creatures and peanut M&M's the size of the goiter in Seinfeld episode 37 dangling from the necks of flying gimps..yes its a scary world but its sort of beautiful kinda.  I cannot show you everything I know and nor would I want nor will to but I can try and tie you closer to the world of bubba,I promise you will never be able to wrap your little bitty brain around it completely, no way.. its too much, too rich and far to poor to really get that involved with on any level other than the surface..surface, who said anything about a surface? Is there a surface in bubba's world? For a surface would be way to ordinary and almost too outlandish to tie down to bubba's world (we will call it bub's place from now on.. is that okay?) . Bubs place is like a magical place thats absent of any real magic. I guess you would call it a non-magical place that houses only a hint of the word magic but not much real magic if you dont know what I mean. Not that bub's place does not have magic in it but your not grasping the concept here. There is magic in bub's place but its the kind that has no real magic in it. get it? ....exactly! The place we call Bub's place is so intertwined molecularly, dna-erly, fused with dark magical powers that the very place itself is completely absent of any ray of magic. Okay, Im losing you , I can tell youve already tuned this whole silliness out. But before you take a fork and begin gouging your own eyes out just to get the excitement level I want to go further.. yes even further.  Before I can let you into the the dark mind of Bubba the CPFRE I will need to start from the begininng.  Who is bubba?
