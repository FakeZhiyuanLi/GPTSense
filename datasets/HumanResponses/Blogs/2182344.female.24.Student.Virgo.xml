      I'm not looking forward to going back to work tomorrow.  Today was my day off, and I did absolutely nothing.  No regrets.  I can't remember the last time that I felt so bad that I simply layed on the couch for the entire day.  I have some sort of a sinus thing going on, and it seems to have completely handicapped me.  I can't concentrate, I can't smell, I can't make a decision, and I feel totally ambivalent to everything going on around me.  I should call in tomorrow because I doubt that I'll be able to work efficiently.  However, the guilt of calling in, regardless of how bad I actually feel, will prevent me from actually doing so.  My co-workers wouldn't be concerned with how I'm feeling, they'd only be concerned with how my absence is affecting them.   I tried to go to the Jenny Toomey show with a friend last night.  The person who suggested that I go, told me that the show began at 7:30.  I thought that it was a bit early, but it was a Monday night, so I didn't question the time.  When we got to the club, there was a sign on the door that read:  "doors at 9, show at 9:30".  So, we left.  My friend has two young children and she was already worried about getting home at a decent time.  We went to a fabric store and bought knitting equipment and a how to book, and then grabbed a bite to eat.  I guess that I still could have gone to the show without her, but by the time that I got home, and she drove off, all that I wanted to do was get into my pajamas (of which I am still in) and go to bed.  This sinus stuff is really getting the best of me.  It doesn't usually hit me this early in the year, so I hope that it doesn't mean that I'll be dealing with it again in December or January.  It was Christmas last year, and I was miserable.    The Joe Schmo show is coming on in ten minutes.  It's the last one when Matt (Joe Schmo) finds out that it was all fake.  That show cracks me up!  It's hilarious.  Whoever came up with it was brilliant.  I've seen most of the episodes, and I wonder how he hasn't caught on.  Some of the stuff that they did was so bizarre that it seems like he would have thought something was up.  But, of course, who on earth would ever think that they had gotten themselves into a situation like that.  It's sad that it's ending tonight.  I don't think that they'll be able to pull it off again.  Man, it's FUNNY!!!  Well, I guess I'll end this entry here for today - gotta get to tv in time for Joe Schmo!

      So, I'm trying this blog thing.  I don't quite understand why I'm doing it.  I've looked at a few others, and it seems that the point is really to use it sort of as a journal, or to showcase your particular talent.  I'm going to learn to knit.  Maybe I will post pictures of my knitting accomplishments in the future.  I've wanted to learn to knit for a while, but never took the time to do so.   A friend of mine also wants to learn this old hobbie, so I think that we're going to learn to knit together.  Oh what fun!    This is sort of strange.  Writing these rambling thoughts on this "blog" which I suppose (if I understand it correctly) can be viewed by those who choose to view it.  Although, I don't know who on earth would choose to read my rambling thoughts.  Except for my husband perhaps.  Or perhaps not.  So, why am I doing it?  Why not, I guess.  If I get bored with it, I suppose I'll stop.    I'm dreading going to work tomorrow.  Of course, I always dread going to work.  Talking to superficial people who think that the world revolves around them and their mink coats is not something that brightens my days.  It makes me sick.  Regardless of how much money I obtain in the future, I hope that I never become like that.  That's not to say that they're all like that.  However, just one of those a day (and there are usually more than one per day), can make me forget about the couple of nice people that may have dropped in.    I can't wait to find my path.  I can't wait to know where I'm going, to be focused, committed to something that I feel is important.  Right now, my life is pointless.  I'm not making a difference in anyone's life.  I'm not changing anything.  I'm going to work everyday and helping rich people choose light fixtures.  I wish that I was one of those people (such as my husband) who never had to question what they wanted to do with their life.  I've been to three different colleges, and had three different majors.  I'm getting ready to go back to college (my fourth) and choose my next major.  I'm not going to allow myself to get diverted this time.  I'm going to focus, and I will not let any small obstacles force me to change my path.  I'm going to focus on the positive aspects of what I'm working towards, and not the negative.  I know that, that has been my problem in the past.    Sometimes I feel so old.  I'm 24 and I feel like I'm not living life to it's fullest.  It's all a matter of perspective though.  I'm living the life that makes me happy at this moment, and I know that there is change in the very near future that will make me even happier and more content.  Comparrison is so dangerous to your emotional health.  I compare myself to people I see on the street.  "She's so skinny", "she looks like she's got it together", "they're really happy".  Small thoughts disguised as observations that tear at my confidence.  I can't seem to control them though.  Of course I do it with people in movies as well.  That's when I begin questioning whether or not I'm getting the most out of life.  I begin to want things that are presently unobtainable to me; wanting things that my previous choices will prevent me from experiencing.  That's when I have to remind myself that I'm doing better than most people my age.  I can pay my bills on time (at least until I return to school.  hmmmm...), I have parents and siblings living nearby who love and respect me, I have a husband who is my best friend and looks at me as an equal, I have friends leading their own complicated lives that share their stories with me and listen to my rambling complaints.  I guess it's human nature though to always compare yourself, your life, to the rest of the world.  To always want more than you have.    I'm going to a show tomorrow at a local music club.  Jenny Toomey is playing.  I've never heard her music, but a girl that I used to work with suggested the show.  She said that her music is similar to Diana Krall.  I like Diana Krall.  I'm going with the above mentioned friend who I am learning to knit with.  It's something that I wouldn't usually do, so hopefully I will enjoy it.  If we don't enjoy it, I guess that we could leave early and go to the store to purchase our knitting supplies.  Hmmm. . . what shall I knit first.  I better start simple:  a pot holder.  Surely, I can knit a square.  We'll see.  My husband seems a little baffled that I want to learn to knit.  He said it's a stereotypical woman thing.  How stereotypical of him to make a statement like that.  I guess that I'm not what he thinks of as "stereotypical", but I'm not one to let the idea of being stereotypical get in the way of my interest.   He likes comic books.  How stereotypical of him.    Okay  -  so this is the start of my blog.  How fun.  I actually like writing in this format to get my thoughts out.  I used to keep a handwritten journal and found it very therapeutic.  Eventually, for whatever reason I stopped.  I tried to start it again a few times, but after only a few entries I would stop again.  Typing is a much easier way to get the words out of my mind.  I can type faster than I can write.

      Well, my chest isn't aching too badly today, but now my back is bothering me.  It hurts to lay on my back, or to lean back against a chair/couch.  It sucks.  I went to the Dr. on Tuesday, and he said that it could be the acid in my stomach backing up into my esophagus (sounds so pretty, doesn't it?).  I have to go to the UK hospital and get some xrays on Monday morning.  Hopefully I'll find something out soon after that.  I don't think it's the acid back up thing, because my back is effected.  I'm really worried about what it is.  Hopefully, it's something simple that can be taken care of easily.  Went to Logan's first birthday on Tuesday as well.  Of course, he didn't really know what was going on.  It was cute though.  As all one-year-olds should on their first birthday, he participated in the tradition of smearing his cake all over himself.  Connor is his big brother, and everyone ended up buying him some gifts as well, since it's the first time that another kid in the house has had a birthday.  I wonder what he's going to think next year when he doesn't get any presents on Logan's birthday.  It was really cute though.  He was soooo excited and hyper.  He probably felt like it was his birthday.   My class began today.  It's going to be rough sitting through 2.5 hours of algebra three times a week, but at least it will be over in six weeks, instead of nearly six months.    We leave for TN a week from tomorrow.  It would be really nice if this little health problem that I'm dealing with would subside while I prepared for the trip.  I have soooo much to do!!  I'm going to Cynthiana tomorrow to swim.  It's sooo nice having a pool available whenever I feel like swimming.  Of course, it does mean that I have to drive to Cynthiana, but it's usually well worth the trip.    That's all for now.

      Robert's working on his laptop on the couch, and my back and chest are aching, so I don't even want to get out of this chair.  I'll just sit here, listening to George Noory on Coast To Coast, writing my rambling thoughts.     I got up at 9 today.  I didn't get to bed until around 2 am last night, but I guess that getting up at 9 am isn't too early.  I had to get up to get the house prepared for my meeting with the pet sitter.  I looked at her website (a few times), and she had pics posted of other pets that she's watched, and one of herself with what I assume must be her dog, in front of her house.  All of the pics show very nice houses, including the pic with her own dog.  So, I am sure that when she drove up to our house, with the dead bushes lining the front yard, and the neighbors house with the gravel parking lot, she must have wondered what kind of house she was about to walk into.  I know that I shouldn't make excuses for where I live.  I'm only 24, and still in college, married, and own a house.  That's pretty good.  Our house isn't all that bad either.  It's not the most attractive from the outside, but that's because vines took over our bushes, and then mysteriously died - after killing our bushes.  I attempted to remove the vines last year, but they were so attached to the bushes, that it seemed almost impossible.  I also found some poison ivy vines in there, so I probably gave up a little sooner than I would have otherwise.  We would have to get a bulldozer out here to dig the dead bushes up - roots and all.  Then we'd have to spend alot of money replacing them.  Being that my neighbors yards and houses aren't extremely attractive, I wasn't too concerned with the appearance of our bushes.  On regular days, that's how I feel - who cares.  But, on the days that someone is coming over, that isn't family or regular friends, I do care.  Anyways, I wanted the front porch and the inside of the house to reassure this woman that our house is presentable, clean, and interesting.  We're not rednecks, we're not lazy, and we don't have velvet Elvis or Jesus pictures hanging on the walls.  Robert thinks that it's ridiculous, and he's right.  It doesn't change the way that I feel though.  I know that people judge you based on how you look, how your house looks...and this woman isn't going to be my friend, she's going to be my pet sitter.  A friend shouldn't judge you, and you shouldn't worry about what they think - at least as far as appearances go.  But, this lady will be in my house when I'm not here, taking care of my pets, and I want her to like me and like my house.  So, anyways, that's my explanation, however ridiculous it is. So, I swept our porch, hung a curtain, swept our floors, straightened the table and kitchen, and cleaned off the back porch.  I made some lemonade to offer her, and then I forgot to actually offer it to her.  I should have offered her something to drink, it was rude of me not to.  Oh well.   I don't have alot in planner for this week.  I had the appt. today, I straightened our bedroom, and did some laundry, went to the grocery store and bought about 33 dollars worth of food (which is really, really low compared to what I usually spend), came home and took a two hour nap, got up and made dinner, ate, watched "Bridget Jones Diary" and went to Speedway and bought some sugary, fattening snacks, and now, here I sit typing this boring blog.  I have alot to do to prepare for this trip that's coming up in less than two weeks, but most of the stuff needs to be done the week of the trip.  Doing them now, would only mean that I'd have to do them again next week.  I hope that everyone enjoys the trip.  I've printed out info on what we can do, where we can go...but I'm making no "plans".  My dad hates plans (the exact opposite of me).  So, we'll just wing it.  Hopefully (and what will probably end up happening is...) we'll just spend the time at the cabin, or in the smokies - not doing the touristy stuff - museums, shopping...There's a park near our cabin called Cade's Cove, and I'd like to go there.  It has cabins, horseback riding....and it's near our cabin.  So, that's the only thing that I want to make sure we do.  The rest of the time can be spent at the cabin, just hanging out.  Dad deserves some rest time anyways.  They're bringing Buddy (Bear's brother) because he's too aggressive to have someone else watch him at the house.  Robert's very against this.  I hope that he doesn't voice his annoyance of the dog coming too loudly or too much.  It will just make my parents feel uncomfortable and angry.  If I say this to Robert, though, he'll get angry with me.  I wish more than anything that he enjoyed animals.  He see them as nothing but annoyances.  He's often too mean to them, impatient with them...He doesn't understand that they're just small, helpless little creatures, totally dependent on us, and giving unconditional love.  We supposedly have this "deal" stating that when all of the animals that we currently own pass away, we will go through the same ammount of time that we have had pets, without pets.  I claim to acknowledge this "deal", but I don't think that I could live without animals.  I have NEVER lived without animals.  I will at least have to have one or two.  Not as many as we have now, but a couple.  He doesn't understand, and nothing that I say seems to have been successful in making him understand.    My new class begins on Thursday.  I'm not looking forward to it.  It's college algebra, and I HATE algebra!!!  I took intermediate algebra last semester - worked my butt off in that class - and still couldn't get above a B.  I'm taking it with the same professor as I had in that class.  He taught it really well, and he was very patient in answering our questions.  There's another woman who was in my class last semester who is also taking it this summer.  I'm glad that I'll have someone to talk to.    I have a dermatologist appt. next Monday.  Yet another Drs. visit to look forward to.  I need to get some moles checked out.  Sounds so attractive doesn't it?  then in September I have the worst Drs. visits of all possible Drs. visits.  That's right - the female-only kind of Dr. visit.  Not looking forward to that AT ALL.  I tend to want to cancel these things last minute.  I've considered cancelling my appt. tomorrow so many times.  I have to go through with it though.  I'm sure that I'll feel sick to my stomach tomorrow.    Ugh!!

      I go to the doctor tomorrow, and I am not looking forward to it.  I haven't been to the doctor in six years, and then it was only for a bladder infection.  I hate going to the doctor's office.  I wish that they still made house calls.  It would be so much less uncomfortable if you could get a physical in your own home.  Well, maybe not - it may seem a little more perverted and creepy.  Less cold though.    I met with the pet sitter this morning.  She seemed very nice.  We've never used a pet sitter before, so I hope that it goes well.  If it does go well, it will be convenient for future trips.  I love having animals, but it's such a hassle to take care of them and travel.  I just worry about Bear snapping at her.  I gave her some dog treats to give him when she enters the house.  Hopefully that will calm him down a bit.  Father's Day was yesterday.  We went to Cynthiana and had dinner at the country club (at 12:30!!), then we all went home and changed, and went back to swim.  Dad, Mom, Robert and Aaron hit some golf balls on the golfing range before getting in the pool.  After swimming, we all came to Lexington to see a movie.  The boys went and saw "Chronicles of Riddick".  It's a sequal to a movie called "Pitch Black".  I haven't seen either, and can't say that I care to.  Us girls saw "Terminal" with Tom Hanks.  It was okay.  Not as good as I had hoped.  After that we went to Ted's Montana Grill and had some burgers.  That restaurant rocks.  The food is fabulous (buffalo), and the ambiance is beautiful.  It's reminiscent of the 1920's - the way the waiters dress, the lighting, the booths, the water pitchers, the music...everything.  I loved it.  I think that dad had a good day, but overall I'm sure that he would have preferred to stay home and rest.  He works soooo hard.   I'm supposed to go to Faye's tomorrow night for Logan's first birthday party.  I don't know what time though.  She hasn't been on the IM all day.  I guess I'll find out tomorrow, if she's still doing it.    Robert and I had a great anniversary.  We spent the day doing things around town.  We decided that we didn't want to do anything extravegant because we're going on vacation on July 2.  We ate at Red Lobster, went to the bookstore, had desert at a quaint, small, expensive restaurant downtown, and went to see "Supersize Me" - which was hilarious, and incredibly sad.  After that we came home and watched "Wyatt Earp" until 3 am.  To most people our lives would seem unbelievably boring.  It's perfect for us though.  Perfect.  We had such a great anniversary.  We decided that for our fifth anniversary (in two years), we'll do something special.  Go somewhere.....California maybe?  That will probably happen before that anniversary though.  Maybe a bed and breakfast in Maine.  I've always wanted to go to Maine.  It looks so beautiful.    We're going to Baltimore and Washington DC in September, and Dallas in October.  I'm a little worried about my school schedule.  I figure that I can miss one day of classes per trip.  That's a bit much though, and hopefully I won't have any exams on the days that I'd have to miss.    Need to get directions to the Drs. office.     That's all for now.

      I made an appointment with the Dr. today.  Faye reccomended her Dr. but he's on vacation, so I'll be seeing another Dr. in the same office.  I've been having chest pains.  I don't know what else to call it.  My chest hurts when I swallow, take deep breaths in, and when I turn over in bed.  I don't know what it could be, but it's lasted for five days now, so I figured that it's probably a good idea to get it checked out.  Unfortunately, the appointment isn't until next Tuesday.  Hopefully I'll be okay until then.

      Went to the Harry Connick Jr. concert last night.  It was amazing!  Not that I expected any less.  He's soo funny.  At one point he was talking for 15 minutes straight, and the crowd was laughing the entire time.  The music was great of course, and his band was wonderful.  He had his band members come down to the front of the stage and perform quite a few times.  I went to the concert with Faye and her mom.  We ate at Reno's before going, and stopped at the Regatta after because Faye didn't want to go home yet.  Unfortunately nothing in Lexington stays open very late.  The Regatta bar was full of drunk college kids hanging all over eachother.  Not really our scene.  I had a great time, and I think that Faye did too.  It's good that she's able to get out of the house every once in a while.  Robert and I are going to see Tim Wilson at Comedy Off Broadway tonight.  We've seen him twice before.  Hopefully his show will be a little different this time.  The second time that we saw him, it was basically the same show as the one we had seen before.  There's a new smoking ban in all public places in Lexington that he'll probably have something to say about.  Maybe he'll touch on the election, Reagan's death...I don't know.  I just hope it's different.  It should be fun regardless.  We're going with his friend Terry and his wife, and two of their friends.  I think that they bought the tickets, and I'm a little uncomfortable with that, because they bought our tickets last time too.  In return, last time, we paid for the pre-show dinner.  This time however, I think that their friends will be at the dinner as well, so I don't know if we'll be able to pay.  We're eating tonight at Bella Note, an Italian restaurant that I LOVE.    It's raining again today.  Imagin that.  I don't think that it will ever stop raining.    I was supposed to go to an auction with mom tonight, but plans changed when Robert told me about this Tim Wilson thing.  She's still going to the auction, so hopefully it won't rain all day.    That's all for now.  Not much on my mind today.

      It's muggy outside, and threatening to rain.    I just came in from class, and Robert's not here.  He's probably out eating lunch with someone.  He goes out to lunch ALL of the time!!  When I suggest going out for dinner, he says something like, "we go out too much.  We should stay in and save money."    Class was shitty today.  We had a group project.  My group consists of myself, and three other people.  One person is foriegn (from Yugoslavia), and she's very nice, tries to understand everything, but has trouble sometimes, I think because of the language used in statistics.  Another person in the group sits there and complains the entire time about how much she wants to finish so that we can leave (when we're through with the project, we can go).  She drove me crazy today!  She said that she's going to NYC this weekend, so I understand her being excited and anxious, but come on!  Shut the hell up, and we might be able to get this thing done!  As we were answering the last two questions, she was talking to someone on her cell phone.  I guess she had done her part.  She was complaining about how much she hated school.  I guess that she doesn't realize that college is optional.   Anyways, enough of my ranting.    What do I have planned for this weekend?  Let's see:  Friday:  Harry Connick Jr. concert.  Very much looking forward to that.  I need to wash my jeans so that I can wear them to the show.    Saturday:  There's an auction in Cynthiana at a woman's house, who I believe was my great aunt.  Not sure on the specifics.  But, a couple of weeks ago, I discovered a love of auctions.  Hopefully she'll have lots of good stuff.  The rest of the day, I'm sure, will be spent in Cyn. with my family.  Sunday:  Spend day with Robert.  I'm not sure what we're going to do.  We haven't made any plans.    Then it's back to school.  Next week should be my last in my stats class.  After that I have to make it through six weeks of college algebra.  Ugh!!    I need to figure out how to post pics on here.  It would be nice to post them so that family and friends could see them too.    That's all for now.  I guess I'm not in the writing mood.  Maybe later.

      Okay - so it's been a while, but I'll give this another chance.    Ronald Reagan's funeral has been on television all day.  I've been rather intrigued by it.  It's sad to see Nancy Reagan having to go through this never ending ceremony.  After being married to one man for 52 years, I imagine that she's wondering how she will go on.  He's "laying in state" today, and going back to California at the end of the weekend to be buried.  I'm in school full time now.  No more working at Kentucky Lighting (thank God).  It's been six months since I left that job, and yesterday was the first day that I have gone in to see all of the people that I used to work with.  I was actually a little nervous walking back into the store.  When I left I tried to get all of my accounts/customers in order, so that there would be as few messes for others to clean up after my departure as possible.  However, with a job as hectic as that one was, it's almost impossible to tie all of the loose ends before heading out.  So, I was afraid that I'd walk in and they'd all hate me, because I had left them with numerous problems to fix.  They all seemed very happy to see me though.  That doesn't necessarily mean that I didn't screw them over (inadvertently of course), but that they were simply hiding their frustrations.  Oh well.  At least I got the visit over with.   My first semester back at school went very well.  I got all A's and one B (in algebra of course).  I'm taking a statistics class for the first summer session, which will be ending next week.  And, I'm taking my last algebra class in the second summer session which will be beginning in a few weeks.  Then comes the fall semester, which should be my last semester at LCC, before I have to transfer to UK.  I have to contact an advisor in the education dept. at UK to advise me on what I need to do at UK.  I'll probably do that in the fall semester.  Robert's still doing the comic book thing.  I say that as if it was just a hobby that I expected him to drop soon after beginning it.  That's not how I meant it.  Of course he's still doing it.  That's WHAT he does.  He's a comic book writer.  He's doing very well at it too.  He's working on a bunch of stuff for Marvel (which is great), and of course still working on his stuff for Image.  He's traveling alot.  More than I like.  He just told me tonight that he might be going to St. Louis this month to meet a couple of other comic guys.  He's going to Chicago and San Diego this summer, and possibly LA sometime soon.    We've done some traveling TOGETHER this year as well.  In March we went to NYC for spring break.  I don't know what in the hell we were thinking.  It was FREEZING!!!  We were there for the St. Patricks Day parade, which I thought would be fun to see, being that I have never seen a parade in NY.  I was very wrong though.  The crowds were so thick that it was almost impossible to round corners on the streets, it was snowing, the coldest day of our visit, the parade was very unimpressive (although I was impressed that all of those men in kilts braved the terrible whether to march in the parade.  I wonder if they cheated and wore something underneath to keep warm?), and a CRAZY lady stopped and asked me about my heritage.  We had a polite, awkward, and short conversation about our ancestors, and then she handed me a photocopied piece of paper (from a very thick stack that she was holding in her arms) and told me to read it, because she was sure that I would find it interesting.  I stuffed it into my backpack, she walked away, Robert took TONS of boring pictures of the parade, and we finally left.  After hours of fighting through the crowds, asking a very helpful police officer for directions, and walking for what seemed like miles, we finally took refuge in a comic shop (guess who wanted to stop there).  I have never been so happy to be inside of a comic shop in my life.  My legs were numb from the cold.  While he looked at the comics, I pulled out the photocopied piece of paper that the crazy lady had given me.  At that point I hadn't realized that she was crazy, just extra sociable.  Of course, I knew that she had an agenda because she was handing out those papers.  However, once I read what was handwritten on that paper, I realized that she was crazy.  It was all about how she was molested as a child by her black neighbor, and her mother lived next door to a Jew, and all Jews and Blacks should be killed...Of course, as you would expect from any crazy individual handing out racist, threatening material on at a St. Patricks Day parade in NYC, you could only read a portion of the paper.  The handwriting was so bad that at least half of it was unreadable.    Besides the parade, which was only a small fraction of our NYC vacation, we did all of the touristy things - the Met, the Empire State Building (which was very unimpressive - Robert hadn't ever been to the top, so we went, but we could go outside because of the weather, and visability was only a mile because of the snow), Central Park (it was beautiful because of all of the snow, but I've seen plenty of snow on trees...here in Ky, so I would have preferred no snow, and warmer tempts.  However, I'm the idiot who went to NY in March), the Frick House (not as impressive as I was hoping, but I may have just not been in the mood)....We saw some great shows.  Match (Ray Liotta play - very good), The Boy From Oz (Hugh Jackman musical - good, but kinda wish that we had seen something else), and Blue Man Group (FANTASTIC).  I feel a little guilty saying that the Blue Man Group was my favorite show, when the other two are far more artistic (or maybe that's a bad judgement on my part), but they were so entertaining!!    Overall, we had a great time.  By the end of the trip, after the cold weather, and our frustrations with not being familiar with the subway...we were both very anxious to get home.  In fact, we both said that we didn't care if we ever went back to NYC.  While I don't see myself going back anytime soon (there are too many other places in this country that I still haven't seen), I do want to go back at some point.  We bitched alot while we were there, but everytime I think back on it, I remember all of the good things.  We really did have a good time.    We also went to Florida in March.  In fact, we went there and saw his family, and then flew to NYC.  During the July 4th weekend we're going to the Smokies.  It's our gift to my parents for their birthdays (which fall like 3 days apart).  We're renting a cabin, and my parents, my brother and sister, their dog Buddy, and Robert and I will all be staying in it.  It's a large cabin. I'm excited about it.  Hopefully it will be very relaxing.  In September, Robert has a convention in Baltimore.  I'm going to go with him, and after the convention, we're going to go to Washington DC and spend a few days going to all of the monuments...I'm really looking forward to that.    Robert's making one last phone call (he spends so much time on the phone that I don't know how he gets any work done), and then he's giving me the rest of the night (we'll see...).  So, I'm off for now......................
