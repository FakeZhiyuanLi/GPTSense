      Well, I've just finished my 9 hour shift, and quite frankly, It was... GREAT! Today had to be my best day at work yet! I finally got to use the Truck to wheel around the millions of trolleys that awaited me on the carpark of lurve, I made one little crash at the beginning and then for the rest of the day, I was error free and flying around with a bazillion trolleys attached to a battery powered toaster on wheels. I made 2 new friends today who are probally the coolest guys on the trolleys - Mark and John. Mark is 19 and John is oldish with grey hair and a moustachio. Today I finally got to use some teamwork that years of internet gaming had taught me so well to collect the trolleys and we kept on top of the work load all day by clearing out bay at a time all together. It was fantastic! And then me and mark got sent on an adventure around the world to collect a trolley that a person had complained about being outside his house (Most likely that he pushed it to his house with all his shopping and couldnt be bothered to bring it back himself as it was about a mile or so away) For anyone who lives near me, It was down on St. James road near the wellington pub. I got to have a good talk to Mark and we laughed at how everyone should be called Mr. Miyagi and we both wished we had his healing hands.     Yeap, that's right, I've figured out how to add imaged to my posts! Prepare to face many more of them in the future.  John was right about the heatwave, it was sooo sunny and hot today, I was nearly melting into the carpark tarmac! When I got home, I looked in the mirror and I think ive got slightly sunburnt cheecks! Which means I now have rosy red cheecks and feel quite stupid I didnt actually wear any suncream. A text of clare defeated the heatwave we had here in Liverpool though because it was 34 degrees over where she was, so I shouldn't really complain about it being hot, actually bring on my nice weather! The more the merrier I am!  I got to enjoy my an hour and a half long break today, but instead of having it all in one go, I split it up into 3 half hour chunks, for the first two I came home, and one time my family were watching the School of Rock which my sister had rented out, It's such a good film! And its also the movie me and clare went to see were we had our first sober kiss! *sings* Because you're not hardcore... Unless you live hardcore!!! and the legend of the rent was way HARDCORE!  Tomorrow dawns a new month, the lovely summer month of august! What will it have in store for me? Hopefully lots of parties, having friends around for drinks, cocktail sausages (a la clares house) all this will only be possible if my family go off on holiday again! Which im 99% sure they will, if they dont I will scream and be forced to smash stuff... Please email me suggestions of things I can smash to -  urlLink jaybones@gmail.com

      Well, Today is the 30th July and that means its Clare's birthday! *dances* I got RUDELY woken up by a text off clare saying that she had just rang my house but my brother didnt wake me up to speak to my girlfriend who I really miss (grr) but she loves my present (wahoooo!) and it made her friend cry!!! (In a good way of course). Before I carry on, I don't know why I'm putting so many brackets in this post but it's lots of fun I can tell you that (It suuuure is!)  I texted her back saying ring again, and I prodded my brother for not waking me, and when she rang I screamed at her HAPPY BIRTHDAYYYY! and apparently she was having a really good day, and she liked the present and her friend organised a special surprise party for her, which wasn't so much a surprise because some lady couldn't keep her mouth shut, but apparently the party was really good! I only got to speak to her for 7 minutes on the phone, but when she gets back from France, she'll have to spend several hours talking to me about all the adventures she had in France along with the many many photographs :D  I'm going to buy her tickets to see  urlLink Hell Is For Heroes  live the day after she gets back from holidays as a little "Welcome back to the best country in the world!" (Ha!) kind of thing.  Of course I'm going to buy myself a ticket too!  Not only is it Clare's birthday but its also my first day off! *boogies* yay! But seeing as I cant get enough of Tescos, I ended up going down there looking for a Computer game with John (Counterstrike - Condition Zero) so that I can get the CS: Source Beta when It's released but he had already bought the last copy in the store, so thankfully I saved myself 20 smackers there really! I got to enjoy my big day off by playing lots of computer games, watching TV, sleeping, watching DVDs and generally being a slob and I quite enjoyed doing nothing for once this summer. The worse thing about a day off is that you know that soon enough you will be back at work/college/whatever doing the same thing yet again but I tend not to think about that side of it... because tomorrow I am working my first full shift (9 hours - Midday till 9pm) and it's gonna be a killer, according to John, it is going to be a heatwave and a half, so I best get my shades and suncream because hopefully tomorrow is going to be a scorcher!

      That's right folks, I had a crappy day at work! I was just in such a gloomy mood and the time just dragged on and on. Firstly it was REALLY sunny until 2 minutes after I got outside my house on the way to work (I was actually running 2 minutes late too) when all of a sudden it just decides to rain, and rain and rain a bit more! 6 hours pushing trolleys in the rain, I know its something I'll have to get used to but it was sunny allllllll day upto when I started work! Arrrgh. But that's not all. I was making loads of mistakes because loads of stupid customers were around, bugging me and leaving trolleys all over the place, I got mixed up and put loads of trolleys in the wrong place and people LAUGHED AT ME! I wasn't impressed to say the least, I grumbled and got back on to work, and remember how I said I was looking forward to using the magic trucks today? Well with my luck, one bloke had lost the keys earlier the same day, so there was only one truck available, but that was in use by this 60 year old man - Mally who spends most of his shift laughing at my expense!  That's not all of my bad day at work, because of all this laughter and rain and mistakes I kept on crashing the trolleys into ballards and I really hurt my stomach, shins, toes, hands, fingers, thumbs and groin, all on seperate occasions!!! I bruised my thumb nail and made it crack nearly in half and it bled and I was like owwwwwwwwwwwyyyyyyyyyyyyy my thumb!!! And I had to go see a first aider and they were like GORDON BENNET! Look at that! Ewww! which didnt really make me feel much better but theres not much I can do about that now. I got a plaster on it, which was ok but it wasnt a colourful plaster with little cartoon people on it, so that made my day at tescos even worse, but thankfully 11 arrived and my new friend Chris the Security guard was leaving that night only to get a job in the Home and Bargain warehouse, easy come easy go I suppose! I was so glad to get home though, I just sat down and loaded up a nice game of Worms Armageddon (which I'm addicted to now)  It's clare's birthday tomorrow and shes in france a good few hundred miles away from me, I really wish I could be there to celebrate it with her, but we dont get what we want sometimes unfortunatly! I just text her wishing her a happy birthday (It's after midnight there in france) all I can hope is that she has a great day with all her friends there in lourdes!

      I've finished my training on the trucks (Quickarts to ordinary non-trolley folk) and I can forsee my job becoming much much easier! With these trucks, I get to push around nearly 20 trolleys in one go, without having to push them one bit, just press a button and steer! Nothing better! I can't wait for tomorrow when I get to fully try it out, to go along with my super training completion, it was really sunny and hot, and it was a fine day for SCIENCE! *ahem* and trolley dollying as well of course!  In the 3 days I've been there, I've already made a couple of mates who seem pretty swish! But I've noticed that most of my trolley co-workers are extremely bitchy (sounds awfully similar to Clare's Health and Beauty Dept. Workers at Over-priced Sainsburys) When one guy isnt around, all I hear is bad stuff theyve done, and no doubt theyll end up talking about me, but I dont care, I'll just get along with my job and enjoy the paychecks every 4 weeks!  I forgot to mention, today I saw my first shoplifter umm.. shoplifting! He ran out the door, only to be chased by 3 beefed up security guards and several managers, he dived across the bonnets of a few cars and jumped on top of a few roofs to get away, but thankfully they caught him, and used extreme force!!! They threw him on the ground and dived on him! It was better than sitting through an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie marathon! The funny thing was is that the shoplifting nutter was not stealing anything too valuable like a digital camera, batteries, or DVDs but he decided to try and steal a few packets of bacon and a steak. What a guy I think now he'll be sitting in some prison regretting he wasnt a vegetarian.  Apart from that, my day has been pretty much uneventful, apart from the and several televisions exploding in Tescos and being punched on the way home... Nah only messing =)  Day Seven is near, Will I survive another day at work? Who knows, watch this space...

      My second day at work is over and my feet are still just as sore as they were yesterday, but I'm not complaining because I have a super duper cool job! It's loads of fun, and because I worked the night shift, the place was empty and I got to stand around and talk to my new friend Chris about random crap for 2 hours with pay! Wahey! Tomorrow is my final day of "Training" as it were, which really should of been over within 15 minutes of me starting because there's not much to learn about pushing trolleys around but nevermind, and after tomorrow, I get to use the magic Trucks to push my trolleys around! Ohhh my job is going to get 30x more easier! I can't wait!  After working from 5pm till 11pm, I arrived home at 12:40am. How? Ohh because I got some supplies in of course, and talking to Chris for about half an hour after work, poor Bonny was sitting by the front door with her legs crossed dying to go for a walk when I arrived back home aww poor doggy. Want to know what I got on my shopping trip? No? Tough luck, I got some skimmed milk because im now being much more healthy (Ive managed to lose half a stone in the last few months just by cutting back on crappy foods a bit, and ive become much less spottier which Im VERY pleased about), some lucozade, mini scotch pancakes for breakfast (yum), and some chewies for when im working tomorrow. Hopefully soon, I'm going to buy some music playing device (MD player probally) and take that to work with me to help me get by those lonely, lonely days.  It's actually 2:13am at the moment and I'm still here typing up my bloggy, I should really get to sleep because I'm at work at 10 for 6 hours and im going to end up curling up in a trolley and going to sleep. So for now, I think ill end this and make a bigger post tomorrow with some more rambleing about nothing in particular... I miss clare =(

      Well, after moaning earlier this morning about the rain and starting my new job, It wasn't as bad I first imagined! Yes, It was raining a bit, but I managed to get hold of a spare illuminous yellow jacket and I managed to blind a total of 7 people today, which is a new world record for jacket related blindnesseseseseseseses.   I got there and my Work "buddy" - Jimmy -&nbsp;didn't have a clue that I was starting or even existed so he was a bit surprised and ranted for about an hour about how he never gets told anything nowdays, but hes a boss fella and he helped show me the ropes, or the trolleys as it were. *bdum tsh* I get to use a little "truck" which is just a little radio controlled electric powered box on wheels that helps you push around several thousand trolleys in one go, its soooo much fun, surprisingly I was actually enjoying my job, UNTIL (oh yes, you knew this was coming) one of the managers asked me politely to scrape up all bits of grass and weeds that were growing in the cracks of the flagstones outside!!! Apparently it's under the job description (Ha, No it ain't) but another manager (Jill - She was my interviewer too) said you're best off doing it, but you can get asked to do all sorts of crazy crap, but dont worry about it. Jill is the cool manager who gave me some over-time hours on my first day! Wahooo! Pushing around trolleys for a bit with a super electronic truck at my disposal was fun but the scraping the grass (only for half an hour mind you) just extracted the michael in my opinion.   Jimmy and I had to go into the warehouse to try and find some scraper thing that the cleaners use to scrape chewing gum off the floor outside, but alas, no scrapey thingymabob was in sight, so we used our initiative (20 points to us) by getting a mop handle without the mop, and a wallpaper stripper dolally and celotaped them together to form our own scraper majig! Woosh!   One of the best parts about my day at Tescos was that I got called with Jimmy to go into prescot town centre and collect the stray trolleys that had gone walkies, we went up to somerfield and stole back a few trolleys and walked around for a bit which was a nice change of scenery (I say this and I've only worked there a day) Apparently theyve been called out as far as Rainhill or Huyton Village to retrieve trolleys (and thats a long distance for a trolley to go missing) and I'm looking forward to a day when I get called out to go walking for a couple of hours with pay!   I get to my only half hour break, and as I'm about to enter the staff restaurant (which is Hella cheap) we get called out to the back where a new delivery of trollies had just arrived, 35 baby carrier doodars and we were like OoOOoOooO bugger off, we're going for our break! So after a nice lunch and a cup of tea, we go back and find out that we're going to need the Truck, and the truck is ALLLLLL the way around the front of the shop, so we cut through the store, but to get back with the truck, we have to leave the car park, go down a main road and down another road just to get to the back of the store! And it takes about 5 minutes to walk it without a truck or a load of trollies, so as you can tell, that took up the rest of my day! By this time, my feet felt like they had been powersanded into a coffee table.   Finally 4 o' clock arrives and I get to come off duty and go home! Hoorar... or do I? NO! I decided that I should get some shopping in seeing as my family is away and we have no milk or bread or BBQ sauce! It came to a total of £5.23! How good is that!!!!! And I bought lots of stuff too, I'm so proud of tescos! *dances* I got some skimmed milk too because I felt like a change and I want to get rid of my tummy, soooo why not go for the healthier, less fatty, still as yummy skimmed option? It's all good!   Enough of work in this rant, let me move on to this evening, I done 3 loads of washing, done some ironing and the dishes, all in preparation of the movie I was going to watch! The name of that movie? "I am Sam" I have seen it before, but it is probally my favourite film ever, they story line is great and it's so moving, I managed to tape it, but I want it on DVD! Maybe there will be extras! Maybe. The only problem is, well not a problem but a very small annoyance is that the film doesn't have a definitive ending, I know that alot of films do, and its not like a cliffhanger ending, but just a "Guess what happened next?" kind of ending, It's kind of obvious but there are still a few loose ends and it makes me scream out for more! Maybe it's just because I dont want the film to end, Every minute, every second I enjoy it and If you havent already loaded up amazon.co.uk to order your copy, DO IT NOW! You wont be disappointed! Hopefully Clare hasn't seen it yet and we can spend an quiet evening together watching it and go through about 70 different emotions together in just under 2 hours.   Speaking of clare, she rang me today! All the way from apparently super sunny and really warm Lourdes, France. Picking up the phone to hear her again just made so happy, I didnt realise how much I miss her already, [getting soppy now] but it was so thoughtful of her to ring me and even though we only spoke for about 3 minutes, It was the best 3 minutes of my day! It's her birthday this coming Friday and she has taken a my present with her, I really wish I could be there with her when she opened it, but i'm sure she'll enjoy it, I spent hours taking photos of lots of places we have been together, and searching all across liverpool for a suitable scrapbook to stick the photos in, the easiest part about it was buying a Pritt Stick to glue the photos to the page, but finally after walking around Liverpool for about 6 hours I think it was, I finally managed to finish taking photos (all the photos are just from liverpool =P) Blood, Sweat and Sugar, sorry Tears&nbsp;went into making it and all I hope now is that she'll enjoy it as much as I did creating it!   But before worrying about if she'll enjoy my present, I have to worry about my poor feet tomorrow as Im working from 5 till 11 pm (6 hours =P) pushing trollies around, I'll end up with no feet by friend, pushing myself around in a modified trolly. Day 5 approaches...

      Its 9:30am at the moment and I start work in 30 minutes! Argh!!! The worse thing is that it's just started to rain and seeing as I'm a trolly dolly, I'll be outdoors all day, without my uniform, meaning I'll have no warm fleece, no waterproof coat, no safety shoes! *sob*    Hopefully no one will come shopping  ever  whilst I'm on duty and I wont have to get any trollies, that or just no-one that I know, so that they can point and laugh and chuckle and fall over in hysterics at my new job =( I just can't handle it!

      What can be better than google? Google Email or Gmail of course! Just when everyone was starting to fall in love with google (I've been a die hard google user for years) they bring out their amazing email system! It's fantastic webmail, with spam filters, conversational emails (hard to explain) but shame for those who haven't got one as it's only in its beta testing stage at the moment! The only thing is that I never get any emails in my gmail (Ohh I can Rhyme) and thats what I love most about having an email account, actually getting emails!   Today with all different Instant Messaging programs such as MSN, ICQ, AOL, Yahoo! etc, I think people are forgetting all about how great emails actually are! It's worse with the Royal mail, with so many people just using the internet to send letters to friends and family, the only post we get are either bank statements or random crap spam mail from the likes of Mecca Bingo.   Everyone feels special when they recieve something which isnt spam or bank statements in the post, and its the same when I get a decent email to read! Its a shame I never get more, Maybe Its because I dont have any friends? NEVER! I do have friends (I think ¬_¬) but no one sends emails nowadays! Having said that, I do get emails fairly often from my girlfriend, and on the rare occasion I get an email or two from my friend Mike, but apart from that, the rest are just annoying forwards where by I'll either day by being run over by a bus in the next 3 hours or I will never fall in love and live alone with my pet rock called cliff if I dont pass it on to 60 people or more within the next 2 minutes. Gah! Forwards are the bane of my life, but back to Gmail and Email!  I try to encourage people to email me, but no one ever does, If anyone is reading this email me! Make me feel loved! =( I'm going to try get everyone on my MSN Messenger list to start sending emails, like it or not, and hopefully get my gmail account active with emails flying everywhere! Come to think about it, I might even start sending hand written letters to people soon! Spread the love! Anyone who might be reading this, send an email to a friend of yours and make them feel special! And whilst&nbsp;you're at it, send me one too =) *wink*   Gmail how I love thee! Its just a shame that emails are too few and far between nowadays! Let's start a revoltion people! Get email-ing!  My Email Address -  urlLink jaybones@gmail.com &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just incase you were wondering ;)

      Well, what can I say? It's been a long day today, it went from bad to good to even better... allow me to explain.  Sunday - Recognised through-out the world as a day of rest, so what does your honourable Jaybones do? He has no time for rest, he fights on! He does all the clothes washing, he does the ironing, he watches a movie, HE HAS A BATH! Yay! No longer is he the smelly daemon he once was! But let me get back to that...  Let me start with this morning - The bad part of the day.  I woke up and to my surprise, I couldnt talk to myself, not like I do, ever... No I dont! ARGH *ahem* but yes I couldn't talk, I couldn't laugh, I couldn't sing, I couldn't LOVE! and also I couldn't swallow, that's right folks, my head had been decapitated by the Prescot Ripper, No seriously, I had the worse sore throat of my life. As you could guess I was not in the best of moods when I woke up then, so after taking the dog for a walk after it tried to scratch my eyes out from excitement (My dog gets hyperactive whenever you pick up a set of keys and tries to jump on top of your head)&nbsp;Where was I? Oh yea, Having just taken the dog out, I stumble down to Tescos (with my keys this time thankfully) and I found some Strepsils Extra (Pain Relief ones) when all of a sudden, Disaster Struck! *horror music* Some grossly overweight, mega obese, scarily ugly 13 year old girl in a shockingly short mini-mini-mini skirt PURPOSELY bumped into me, just to piss me off. I was a bit annoyed but I ignored it, carrying on looking around, I find myself drooling over some loaves of bread when the same girl is walking towards me, and I ignore her presence when she walks behind me, she elbows me on purpose! Grrrrrrr so by now I was fuming... so I walked around the shop a bit more to get away from this psycho biatch then she comes at me again in some other isle, so i turn around and try to scream at her "FUCK OFF WHORE" but it ended up sounding like a hamster being squeezed, sort of like this "FucJFheuiheurher GrrHrlgrlg" I just couldnt talk and I just kind of whimpered, found her mother and whispered what she was doing to me, and she shouted at her infront of everyone, Score one for Jaybones!  After this my day started getting better, after some lozengers my throat felt much better, I done all the ironing and washing, but saying that I have some new washing to do! Oops! After all this, I sat down and enjoyed watching Orange County on TV, Id recommend it to anyone who hasnt seen it yet! I was going to tape it for the "other half" but I missed the first 15 minutes of it because I was playing "boy games" (Worms Armageddon as a matter of fact) and then the moment of glory arrived..  I started to run my first bath in about 4 years! I think the whole world cheered for no longer would they have to put up with my grotesque smell! You've probally guessed that I always get showers instead because theyre much more quicker and less water consuming ("Save the planet" I always say) Whilst the water was running, I made myself a big mug of coffee and put on some music, then once in the bath, it was one of the most relaxing things ever! I'm going to get a bath more often! (Sorry world!) And that leads me to now, just gone past midnight once more as I've just entered the realms of Day Four...  What will tomorrow (today *prod*) bring? Who knows but what I do know is that I start work for the first time today at 10am and finish 6 hours later at 4pm, pushing trollies around all day, there's going to be plenty of fun to be had, I just hope that crazy girl shows up so I can ram 30 trollies into her kneecaps! Grrrr...

      Let me start off by saying WAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I was woken up several times this morning by my family coming in and out of my room, but I finally got out of bed at 11 to bid farewell to my family (and sister!) as they departed for the South of Wales! Yay! As soon as the door closed behind them, I just started to dance around the house shouting and screaming because I was FREEEEEEEE! Yes, WAS... 10 minutes later, my Dad bursts through the doors looking for a spare light bulb for the brake lights in the car! Jeeze, that ruined the moment of freedom but nevermind! I had to get ready for my new Job (Trolly Dolly =P) so I dived in the shower and went down there all dressed up in my fancy white shirt and pants, I get there to be welcomed by 10 other people for their Induction to the job, each person had a different position to me so I felt a bit left out, most were in the Café! But what struck me was how EVERYONE was wearing their own clothes, I felt a bit stupid showing up like that, but nevermind, No harm done! 4 hours of watching videos, joining the Workers Union, sorting out uniform needed and ordering it (I get the most uniform because I work with the trollies! I get super water proof pants, safety shoes, a Tescos Fleece and a glow in the dark blind-everyone-in-a-53-mile-radius jacket and some more pants and shirts all because I rule!  I even found out my lovely working hours, I work for a total of 19 hours a week but I'll be doing lots of over-time during the summer holidays whilst its not too gloomy outside with British weather kicking in any time soon! Without the over-time I get a nice total of £81.32 a week which aint bad at all in my opinion! Take £1.50 from that for being in the union and I get just under 80 smackers which again is still not too bad at all! and when I go back to college, I'll be getting EMA payments each which which are a total of £30, which I can't complain with one bit, Getting paid to go to college, nothing better! So in total that brings me up to £111.32 a week! Not bad going if you ask me! That's $204 or €167 or 22,403 Yen wahoooo! If only it was 22,403 pound a week, Id be super rich!  If only I was super clever too, I managed to lock myself out of my house today, and with no family in for a week, that's not always a good thing! I was just taking my doggy (bonny) for a walk and shut the door when I realised I didn't bring my keys out with me! I quite literally screamed and said a few naughty words which I won't discuss here, thankfully my Nan has a spare set of keys incase I do anything stupid like that so I plod over to her house with the doggy and i'm saved! Apparently she was going to be leaving 5 minutes after I got the keys for a few hours so I had some good luck there!   I did my first clothes wash today, I put my shirt in the washing machine and turned it on, BIG ACHIEVEMENT I know, but it's the first time I've ever washed clothes, and I have to do it all by self this week 'cause I'm a big boy now! But what's even better is, I did lots of ironing whilst that shirt was in the wash! I ironed a few of my shirts and some other bits and bobs that my family left on the washing lines! I was so proud of myself, Of course, It's impossible to do ironing if you're not watching Spongebob Squarepants! That makes ironing SO MUCH more fun! (No, Seriously It does!) Day Two without the missus ordering me around or without one of my best mates hasnt been to bad because I've kept myself ocupied but I got a text of her saying how good the swimming pool is there and now I wish I was with her swimming :( Even though she wouldnt ever let me see her in a swimming costume :/   One last thing before I leave, Today at "work", I wore a pair of shoes which were a size too small for me, I didn't realise until I got there and my toes were REALLY hurting, so I basically took the shoes off and killed everybody in the room with the foul smell of my feet! It was fun! I didnt realise how painful smaller shoes can be after 4 hours of torture! Anyways, It's hit midnight again and I must prepare myself for the spooky Day Three when another of my best friends returns from his holidays! Many games of counter-strike await me! Yay! Hasta Luego...

           Hi there and welcome to my blog! My name is Jay Leather and I should already know that seeing as I’m talking (writing) to myself! Where do I start with these things? Well I’m just going to ramble and if anyone actually reads this *waves*   hello to you! And if anyone actually reads this and doesn’t fall asleep, then email me because you’ve won a prize! *claps*                  I thought I’d create this blog to just let me ramble about everything going on, because as of today, my lovely girlfriend Clare, has gone on holiday for two weeks to the sunny south of France! So I’m girlfriendless in Seattle for two weeks, which might seem bad enough, but it gets worse! One of my best friends – Mike – has gone to Tukey today as well for two weeks also! Argh! I’m all alone, there’s no one here beside me! (Name the movie!) but it doesn’t end there, tomorrow, My family are all going on holiday for a week! Yay! I got quite scared this morning though, after being woken up by a text message from Clare whilst she was on the coach, my mum tells me that the family are going on holiday tomorrow! That kind of shocked me into a state of woken-upness! But not everything went my way, it turns out that my sister (Jessica) was going to stay here with me too! ARGHHHHHHHHHH                If my sister were to stay, all we would do is argue, fight, and throw plates at each other leading to a gun fight, a few lightsabers, then a civil war, leading to world war and of course the end of the world, all because my sister stayed at home, so I had thought all this through, and explained to her in terms that she could understand, (“You’re not staying here! You can get lost!”) and so she is going with Mum, Dad and my brother to the also sunny – South of Wales. =)               I start work tomorrow, and it’s the first job that I’ve ever had! I'm quite scared about it all but I'm sure I’ll be fine! Does anyone want to take a guess at what my job title is? No guesses? Nobody? I guess I shouldn’t really expect a response seeing as I'm talking (typing) to my self! But I'm a Trolly Dolly for the glorious Tescos Supermarket! Don’t you laugh at me, it’s mean!                 All hail the mighty shopping trolly/cart!!!               Its only been a day since my girlfriend has gone, but I do miss her already, I went to her house yesterday with my new digital camera and took some pictures of her so I don’t forget what she looks like whilst she’s away for all those years… well, 2 weeks! It’s just gone past midnight and I now enter the gloomy shadows of Day 2...

      Bad Boys, Bad Boys! *ahem*  Sorry, Tonight I watched the awesome Bad Boys II starring non other than Will Smith and Martin Lawrence!       I might as well the rest of the day first! I had to force myself out of bed at 11AM! That's seriously messed up for a holiday, generally I'm never awake to see the morning but today was an exception because I was going to Liverpool with the infamous Holly Miller! I haven't seen her since her party-thingymabobba over a month ago back at the beginning of the holidays! I met her on the train and we just talked and chatted and nattered and jibber-jabbered for ages about everything and when we arrived in Liverpool, we went to the Albert dock because she wanted to go look around the Tate Gallery! Before we got in there however, I had the biggest shock of my life, the island they used for Fred the Weatherman's reports from "This Morning" has gone! They've removed it! I almost felt like crying, I sometimes went there as a kid to watch him give the weather and scream "OoOoOOOooOh" Everytime he jumped across from england to ireland!  Anyways, We finally entered the gallery after me moaning and crying for several minutes and to be honest, It was a lot better than I expected! They had some pretty cool exhibitions going on, and I got to put my really heavy coat in their Cloakroom! FOR FREE! How great is that? Very. One of the best bits was an artist had made a DVD about Aeroplane Hi-Jackers and shows a very light hearted side to it all, and how they arn't all as bad as they seem! (At least the ones from Israel back in the 60s/70s) they just did it to prove a point, as some anti-israelism protest, no one ever got hurt, and there were interviews with the hostages and they said they were not scared at all! Infact half of them said they enjoyed it and the Hi-Jackers were really nice! That's americans for you! But one example was that it was a lady's birthday on one of the days they hi-jacked a plane, and for the "terrorist" demands, they wanted a birthday cake and champagne for the lady! That was all! How cool?   I walked around the Tate Gallery with no shoes on, because the night before, due to the thunder storms and torrential rainfall, I couldnt wear my trainers, so I had to wear proper shoes, which REALLY hurt my feet! So I took them off and walked around in my socks because I rock, and people were like "Oh my! He's setting a new path for art!" and I was like "No suckers! My feet just hurt! Haha!"  Anyways, after I got back from liverpool, John came around and we went down to the Video store, and after spending over half an hour just staring at VHS and DVD cases, we finally decided to rent out Bad Boys II, I have never seen the original Bad Boys so I was a bit worried that I might not pick up on what excatly is going on but that was not the case at all! The movie kicks off with the Ku Klux Klan having a gathering by the water, chanting for "white power" when our man Will Smith pops out in the middle of them and it just gets better from there! Its a great mix of action and black comedy, playing on lots of techniques of the blaxploitation movie era with lines like "Damn nigger!" and if that kind of stuff floats your boat I'd highly recommend this film, I suppose the story line isn't the greatest but nevermind! Maybe I should copy and paste some of this into "The Review Centre" but nevermind!  Then after the film, John and I were just talking and ended up talking about some really mad things. He thought he was clever coming up with the idea of a Bicycle-Car, where the driver rides a bike to power the car... Energy efficient and a rain cover, but he forget how the driver would operate the brakes and how hard it would be to move a car fixed onto a bicycle. It was funny at the time, believe me =P  There was not much else to my day really, so if much happens tomorrow at work (9 hour shift argh!) I'll probally rant on a bit longer and with more coherence! Day Sixteen awaits!

      Today was just damn crazy! Before I get to what happened at work let me start in the day! My cousin's PC just refused to work with the internet and he wanted it formatting for when the Blueyonder Internet Fix-it-All megaman came around, the computer *should* run much faster! So happily I waltzed over there and began the format, and I got to enjoy watching Spider-man 2! It really is so much better than the first movie (Even though that was brilliant) but there are thousands of cheesy lines in this movie that are so obvious and well, cheesy for example...   "The power of the sun in the palm of my hands..."   That one gets repeated a few times by crazy crazy Doc. Ock. But despite that, it's a really good movie and is well worth watching!  Then after the PC was back up and running, the Blueyonder man came around, and basically just said that running the Broadband on USB for your computer is just going to be really slow, and you need a network cable! This should of really been provided free, but he just told my cousin to go and buy one and fit it! The cheecky sod, thankfully I know how to shove bits of metal into a computer (barely) so after my cousin (Anthony) bought the network card, I had to fit it, and get the internet up and running! That didnt take too long but as I just got it all sorted, I heard a huge clap of thunder, the time - around 4:30pm... That's 30 minutes before I started work! Arrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Another crazy thunder-filled, stupidly wet night was ahead of me!  I got there and it was really warm and humid for the first hour or 2 but there were random bits of lightning and thunder claps dotted between, but without the rain. I thought this was really odd because according to the song, Thunder only happens when it's raining, but OBVIOUSLY this isn't always the case, but of course, after some time, it began, but it didn't begin lightly, oh no, It was lashing it down with rain, and within a couple of minutes, there were huge puddles all around the car park. Me and this other lad were hiding in the Trolley bay until it calmed down but there seemed to end, so we finally got the guts to go out there, get the trolleys we had collected and get them to Tescos as quick as possible, whilst gathering some sympathy for ourselves too (This later paid off) We went inside whilst the storm was on and I was wet right through, even my shirt under my "waterproof" jacket. LIES! But anyway, we went for a cup of tea whilst we were wet to try warm ourselves up and as we ended the staff café, one of the mangers of the mangers (really high up on the Tesco's ladder) just went OH MY GOD YOU ARE SOAKING! And after much sympathy, she called for a manager to get me a t-shirt off the shop floor and to sit and dry off for a bit! Yay! I was so thankful, but the funny thing was that instead of getting a manager to get the t-shirt for me, she ordered the crazy red haired biatch who screamed at me 2 days earlier! I laughed when she gave me it, but she was actually being kind to me today, so I'll let her off for the other day I suppose, because I'm such a forgiving person!  The rest of the night, I didn't get as wet, because I just came inside as a storm kicked off (There was about 8) and avoided the really heavy rain, but still got very wet as I had to work when the storms died down a bit! My shoes we're the worse, well Trainers. They were sooo wet it felt like I was walking around in slime filled boxes. It was truely disgusting but there was not much I could do about it! My shift finally finished and I dashed home, but the shoes in the washing machine and got a well deserved shower! I made another couple of amigos at work today though thanks to the rain and the sympathy! I just went straight to my bed after that and slept the night away! But my sleep was going to be interupted because I was going to have to get up early, why? Find out in tomorrow's post! =P

      Today wasn't nearly as wet and stormy as yesterday, and thankfully I didn't have to work either! So during the day, I sat at watched television, playing computer games, got shopping and generally lazed around the house doing nothing until the evening came, when I invited John and Charli to come around and watch a movie of some sort! What movie? Goodfellas!       Made in 1990, this has to be one of the greatest films I have ever watched! The actors are great especially Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci! Charli had gone home before we started to watch it but that just meant more sweets and random crap for me and John! We all went to tescos when they arrived to buy lots of sweets (mainly flying saucers and cola bottles) and we were going to rent a movie out from the video store but nothing really dipped our donuts so to speak, so John suggested we wath Goodfellas, which I had never seen before and apparently this was a crime against humanity, so he phoned him mum and got her to bring the DVD along with some other random stuff as he was sleeping over!   We put on the movie and sat there with a giant bowl (We used a casserole dish) with sweets and other things thrown in, and a big bag of Latino Doritos with dip and enjoyed the 2 hour 20 minute movie! Then we ended up staying up till some stupid hour in the morning (about 4 or 5 am) talking about nearly everything possible! I know this kind of leaks onto Day Fourteen but it all counts as the same day in my books and after hours of talking and munching on cola bottles, we ended up going to sleep, to ready ourselves for the crazy Day 14... meaning a full 2 weeks without Clare, and another day at work with predicted thunder storms in their masses! BRING IT ON!

      Today was a complete and utter messed up day, nothing was normal and I'm just sat here going ¬_¬ about the events I went through today, All will be revealed soon enough after I make myself a cheese toasty...  Yummm that was very yam yam. Anyways back to the point, I'll start with the morning shall I? I kept getting woken up by my family coming in and out of the room, I didn't think much of it at the time, until my mum made make up by telling me that they were going on holiday in just under an hour! Short notice to be honest! I climbed out of bed, and I found an letter for me! Yay! It was my Hell is for Heroes tickets! I thought I had better ask when my family are coming back from their holiday... it turned out to be Monday... MONDAY?!? That's the same day that Clare gets back from France! I texted her telling her about it, and apparently my family do it just to spite me, I'm sure shes got a point there... *grumbles*  So after being a little bit grumpy about this, how does it get worse? My sister tells me that she is staying with me for the week! NOOOOOO! I couldn't believe it, I wanted her to go, we just don't get on. At all. I suppose it wasn't so bad because I wouldn't be having any parties or big gatherings this week, all I wanted to do was just sit around, or work when I had to, so I just asked her to keep out my way for the week!  If my family go away on holiday again, there is absolutly no way that she is going to stay, I won't let her, I will force her to go, and that's a promise!  So after a few hours of sitting around the house with my sister, and sitting out on the balcony enjoying the sun, 5pm arrived and I had to go to work, generally 6 hours of pushing trolleys isn't that bad! And it wasn't at first! I got to use the truck all to myself and get loads of trolleys, but it was surprisingly busy, and people just kept using up ALL the trolleys and there were a few comments about lack of trolleys because people had left them all over the place (They complain about things they do =/ very odd) but after I just started to get on top of the work load, what happens? It starts to rain... I thought nothing of it at the time, until it turned into a something similar to someone getting a bucket full of water and tipping it over your head, but just continuously, yes that's right torrential rainfall in lovely prescot! This quickly turned into a thunder storm and big bolts of lightning shooting everywhere. Me and a bloke called Michael came inside because it's a breach of Health and Safety to handle lots of metal objects whilst there is lightning going on. The storm went on for about an hour and I was soaked to my skin, my shoes were squeaky and I quickly got the sniffles! (aww) I went for a cup of tea to warm myself up which really helped, and as I came back and stood at the front door waiting for the thunder storm to go, it happened...  This tall, red haired lady came storming over and shouted at me, "Seeing as you're not doing anything and just standing there... Go and get all those F***ing baskets collected now!" This REALLY annoyed me, because firstly, She was not a manager and she was a worker on the same level as me, and she dared to try and order me around, she stands at the front end of the store and orders everyone around, a Wanna-be manager, and secondly, I wasn't just stood around, I felt like screaming back at her and ordering her to go outside and collect trolleys with there being lightning and torrential rainfall and see if she isn't just "stood around doing nothing" after 5 seconds of being out there. Grrrrrr  I got the baskets and the storm wore off, just as the rain was dying down and I was about to leave, she came over again and told me to get back outside and start collecting the trolleys. I should of really rammed a trolley into her knees and watch her give out orders to the nurses in hospital as she gets new kneecaps made from paper maché.  It continued to rain for the rest of my shift (a good few hours) and finally 11pm came but for the last 30 minutes and about an hour after I finished work, I was talking to the security guard on the front door about everything, I made a new friend! Wooo! His name is John and he is a host for the internet serving it to the masses and an ex-army officer and fully trained sniper. Scary stuff, I would just like to see a shoplifter running as fast as he can across the carpark to get away with a pack of bacon and John just pull out a sniper rifle and take him down from a mile away. Shoplifters arn't cool!  Can anyone guess what I done as soon as I got home? I got a shower! Congratulations to anyone who got that, a prize is winging its way to you as we speak. I got all warmed up and played a few games of Counter-strike and Worms Armageddon against John! Nothing better after working several hours in the rain! Tomorrow is here already and I'm not at work, will I have any adventures to talk of? Maybe... Maybe Not. =/

      I think today was a bit more exciting that yesterday's installment of nothing. First thing's first... I actually got out of bed before midday today and I was quite pleased with myself about that, only to find myself blowing up some worms yet again, but today had a slight change...  After an hour of being back in the real world, my mum comes into my room and tells me that the family are going on holiday again for a week starting tomorrow! Yay! And I think my sister is going too so another week of having the house to myself, walking around in my underwear and showering with the bathroom door open! YES! I think they enjoy winding me up because they said they are coming home on the same day that Clare gets back from france, so I wont get to spend some quality time with her unless we want Matthew bouncing around babbling about pokémon or my sister bursting in the room every five minutes to check we arnt up to anything suspicious or my mum entering the room every 7 minutes offering to make us a drink or a bite to eat! To be honest, That's not my idea of some quality time...  On the other hand, whilst theyre away, I might get a few people around for a small social gathering, whereby we talk, and drink, and laugh and watch a movie of some kind whilst devouring some yummy doritos (salsa dip included), but then again I may not and I might decide to be a hermit and never leave the house once during the week I have to myself and ponder "Why does it always rain on Travis?" for several hours a day followed by massive amounts of sleep, but I seriously doubt I'll be doing that, Small social gathering here I come!  Not only did I find this information out, but I actually left the house today! *shock* Yeap, Me, John and Charli went on a big exploration around the marvelous town of St. Helens, and I bought good ol' (but new) Counter-Strike: Condition Zero at PC whilst Charli got yet another addition to The Sims *rolls eyes* but saying that, The Sims 2 is out this september, and I wouldnt mind having a bash at that! I doubt I'll be buying it however, maybe secretly obtaining in some secret way *cough* download *cough*. But the highlight of my day was spending about 2 hours sat in subway, with tomato sauce smeared across my face after eating a Meat Ball Sub talking about random crap such as the Death Penalty, Taxes, Political crap, Computers (who would of expected?) and just life in general, I think it was a bit more constructive than being sat at a computer all day playing games, or writing out my thoughts into a blog... hmmm ¬_¬  Another great thing however, was that there was a big thunder storm tonight and I love them! Being the "safety first" kind of guy that I am, I turned off the computer, unplugged any plugs and taken them out of the sockets, then sat back in the dark, listening to the loud crashes of thunder outside, but at the same time, trying to comfort poor bonny who was super scared of it all and was hiding behind the toilet seat (apparently she is safe there). What a night! But now I think its best if I got to bed, and get well rested to bid my family farewell and to begin my second week at work! ¡Buenas noches amigos!

      Well, Day Ten has been and gone, and I can't say much happened! I didn't hear from clare today, probally because shes livin' la vida francia, but life goes on! I think I set a record for doing nothing today, I woke up just after 2 IN THE AFTERNOON! And I was kind of shocked at my lazyness, so i crawled out of bed and made some breakfast, or is it lunch? But its close to dinner? So it was kind of a breaklunchyinner meal, and then I just enjoyed multiple games of Worms Armageddon for the remainder of the day, swinging along on a rope, blowing up tiny little worms with bouncing sheep filled with explosives, this is the life.  There's not much to really say about my day to be honest, but tomorrow If i wake up at some sensible hour, I might go down to the gym and do a bit of swimming which I haven't done in a while, because I have another day off from Tescos! Hoorar!  The one thing that has been bugging me ALL DAY is that I can't stop singing a little tune from the School of Rock, I couldn't get to sleep last night because I was humming it, and when I stopped humming, I was singing it in my head! Arrghh, and it's been the same all day, Why won't it stop! Maybe it's because of the great bass line, or the face melting riff? Or even the gut-buster drum solo? Who knows? But if you want to be tormeted for the next few days,  urlLink download this  and enjoy your doom.  Actually, Theres another thing that has been bugging me, but only at night times. My little brother! ARRRGHHHH I just want to scream at him, but even if I did, It will do no good. He grinds his teeth in his sleep, and because I have to share a room with him, I have to put up with it EVERY SINGLE NIGHT! He does it every couple of minutes for about 10 seconds, and its one of the most disgusting and annoying noises ever heard! I swear I will go insane soon, He never used to do it but over the last few months he just started to and if he doesnt stop soon, Im going to take drastic measures.... I'm going to buy some earplugs. ROAR! Fear my threat to purchase! Not only that, but I might also invest in some blackout curtains for my room because I always get woken up by the sunlight and thats also rather annoying, but I might save that for a later rant.  This is Jaybones signing off... hasta pronto.

       Don't you just hate it when people use fake accents?   This is one of my pet hates and it really winds me up! You might not have noticed that people around you do it, maybe you just take it for granted that they do and consider it normal, but I don't. I consider it anything but normal. Try the word&nbsp;ANNOYING. I really only know two people that do this, and I hope I don't come across anyone else that does it... for their sake!   There's a girl in my year (I won't name names, let's call her 'Sandra') and she's been through alot this year. She's been engaged and she's suddenly changed from a wollyback to a scouser. Now nothing against scousers here because the two main contributors on this site will kick my ass. No seriously, I was born and bred in Liverpool so you could say I was one myself. My dad's pretty damn scouse too! Just I've known 'Sandra' (yes, put your two&nbsp;hands in the air, extend your&nbsp;index and middle fingers and bend them&nbsp;twice [air quotes lol])&nbsp;since year 7 and she's always been a wollyback! I thought it was pretty weird when she started talking scouse one day! All it took was a liverpudlian boyfriend and 'Wham'... new accent! I've learnt to deal with it, but everyone's noticed and its too noticeably fake. Anyone who's in my year will know what I'm talking about.   And again... my sister. Her and her friends have this annoying American accent they use when they're with each other. ARGH it winds me up!&nbsp;I thought she might have grown up a bit since like 4 years ago, but it turns out I was wrong. Very wrong. Everytime I hear it I cringe! She sounds like a freaking cheerleader gone wrong. Blow my brains out&nbsp;please. Does anybody else have friends or siblings that do this as well? I think it's just me :S   One circumstance I don't mind people putting on accents, is when&nbsp;they're doing an impersonation. Then it's just fun and cool! I'm personally not good at accents so if I'm doing an impersonation it tends to be in my accent (except for Bond and Arnie), so you won't hear an accent that's not mine too often lol.   Phew there's a ton and a half lifted off my chest!

       Ok so the latest on the press? A year ago a kid murdered another kid, they were like 14 or something, anyways the kid said he did it because he played the game 'manhunt' and thought it'd be cool to kill some guy he knew. Now for those who arent into computer games, Manhunt is a game where you basically run around and kill people in all kinds of grusome ways, the more horrible it is the more points you get, or something along those lines (I've never played it but I sure want to!). Anyways if you are a stuck up prick then yes you could say that playing these types of games could lead to angry people going out and killing people, however.... If you are of sane mind, you will see things very differently, here are my opinions on the matter..  &nbsp;  The kid was 14, the game was rated 18.. (can ya see where I'm going with this?) First thing you think is how disgraceful that shops these days selling kids these games thats rotting their minds. I thought that too, but like you i was WRONG! The shop refused to sell the child the game.. how did the pubesant brat with a mind of a sponge get his spunk crusty hands on them???? His Parents bought it him.  &nbsp;  Now hold up, the parents buy him a game rated 18/Adult, and they wonder how their little boy gets a disturbed mind? O.k. Then...  &nbsp;  The reason I'm talking about this now is that i've just heard now that there aer currently talks about how all these not so nice games are going to be banned?! Say What?! Just because this 14 year old who didnt even get served with the game, his parents bought it him, played this game, and murdered someone, ALL violent games are going to be banned?!?  &nbsp;  I've played all of these games:  Hitman (where you play the role of an assassin)  GTA (where you rob cars and kill people)  GTA3 (Same as above but in 3d and more graphic)  GTA:VC (Same as above but the story plot of the game revolves around drug smuggling)  The Quake Trilogy (monster shoot em up)  Counterstrike (Kill the Opposite Team)  &nbsp;  Now just because ive played and in most instances completed these games for the past, oh i dunno 7 years? (yes again some of these I was underage when I played them, however..) I have never killed anyone, stolen a car, smuggled drugs, used a hooker or axed an evil monster, these games havent effected me in the slightest.  &nbsp;  I think its sick that some fucked up kid with crap parents and a playstation can simply blame murder on the fact he played a particular game, does that mean its ok for me to do drugs cos i've seen it on telly? Or 'Fuck the Po-lice' just because I heard it on a CD? Does it make it ok to go around chasing faries just because thats what I did when I played zelda? The answer no its not, I cant believe a bull shit story like this could even be considered, its silly I hope the lad spends his life in prison and is charged with being a bint and never allowed near any form of media ever again for fear the influences given off by media will make him kill more people or some crazsy shit.  &nbsp;  And if they do ban violent games, what will happen to all the people who want to vent their anger in&nbsp;a fantasy role without actually harming anyone in real life.. I.e. when i get pissed off I own some noob on CS and I feel much better, I'll tell you what'll happen, theyll buy guns and take it to the streets.. Good bye Liverpool, Hello Compton!     &nbsp;  I've just found out that the boy in question was a drug addict in serious debt, the use of drugs caused him to not be able to perceive the difference between the game and reality.. they failed to mention however that it was simply the fact he was a crackpot looney kid who just murdered his mate for money to settle his drug debts and is using this stupid idea of the games influencing him and an escape plea, because he's such a white trash piece of shit that commited such a sickening crime that no other type of plea is ever going to work.. I hope they give him the chair.

       No it's not what you think, I'm not gettin married, I'm on about the phone line in my house... constantly engaged. The culprit is none other than my little sis. Grrrrr!!! Her name is Becky and she's 14 and so fustrating sometimes!     &nbsp;   Most of the time she is on the phone to random people, for hours on end, blocking up the phone line. I mean, I don't mind a couple of hours spent chatting to a good mate,&nbsp;&nbsp;like I ring John or even my mate Nicci... but Becky, oh god no... she's different. She can spend 3 hours on the phone to people she probably doesn't know too well and from the sounds of it she never has anything decent to talk about. Maybe the odd slagging session (she can be quite bitchy!) or the silent conversation with the odd "Sooooo, what do you wanna talk about?", which may I add is usually in this stupid accent which really winds me up (but I won't get into that today.. that's a post in itself!). I feel like saying If you haven't got anything to talk about get off the phone and let others use it! People might be trying to get in touch, and there's 3 other people in the house to consider... does she ever&nbsp;think that&nbsp;we might want to ring somebody too?     &nbsp;   The amount of times I've walked into the kitchen during the day to get a drink and she'll be sat there with the phone on speakerphone balanced on the table, eating her lunch, not a word being spoken. I feel sorry for the poor sod on the other end having to listen to her muching away! Wouldn't you at least say like, "I'm having my lunch now, I'll ring you back" or something! Arrrrggghhh!     &nbsp;   Oh and her bloody sleepovers. During the weekends and most days during any school holidays she'll have people sleeping over. Anything from 1 girl to 12. And I hate it. To be honest her mates (and herself especially it seems) are quite immature for their age. They run around like loose dogs yapping and screaming! They have the&nbsp;TV on too loud, so when the rest of the family are tucked up in bed, it takes longer to get some shuteye as all you can hear or think about is those lot messing about downstairs or laughing wayyyy too loud in her room!&nbsp;I'm not being&nbsp;picky, I'm sure you'd&nbsp;say the same if you had to live with her!     &nbsp;   And to make matters worse... sleepovers and stupid phonecalls put together! Her mates and herself&nbsp;usually pile around the kitchen table with the phone on speakerphone (oh yes... yet again!) for about 2 hours, talking crap and usually not speaking at all! And the REALLY annoying thing, is that when you walk into the kitchen when they are all sat there around the table on the phone, they say "Say hello to whatsaface!" and I'm like, "How about no?!"     &nbsp;   LIVING PROOF! (Guess what, at the moment it's 23:15 and the phones just rang... parents are in bed as they both work and have early mornings (especially my dad at 5:30) and I just answered the phone and this rude little shit is on the other end, "Becca there?". Can&nbsp;they not string a sentence together properly? Most of them are scallies (ask John and he'll back me up on this. Oh goody that's another post on the people she hangs out&nbsp;with! The lot that have hidden in my house and my mates had to chase them away at night, when my rents were out!)&nbsp;And they shouldn't ring so late anyway! At least give them warning so they can pick up the phone straight away so as to not wake my rents up!)     &nbsp;   Jeese, I don't know anybody else that&nbsp;could wind me up anymore than she can! And to make matters worse I have to deal with complaints off John and even my nan! My nan lives about 3 hours away and our family don't get to see her too often. Me and John went down the stay there for a week and I felt pretty wrecked when she went on about how our line is always engaged. I had to explain about Becky and she wasn't impressed with her.. she seemed pretty upset as she mentioned that she's never able to chat with my mum anymore as she can't get in touch. &nbsp;   &nbsp;   Nuff Said Biatch

       Now this is something which is going to relate to everybody. We all use the internet, some of us more than others, some of us too much. How come everybody is so cock when using the internet? People seem to think that when they log onto the internet its like starting up some fantasy role playing game where they can do anything they want without consequences, they dont grasp the concept that if they offend people they cant just dissconnect and forget about it because one day theyre gunna offend someone who owns a car, a bad temper and some spare time, and even if they live far away theyre gunna get their ass kicked.   I love to turn up on someones door stop and go hey i'm John, remember me you called me a cunt cos i killed you whilst we were playing Counterstrike!?   Wheres his friggin gun now prick? I bet he's some scrawny sexless git as well. People like that should be banned from the internet.

       OK&nbsp;so as i mentioned I was on my driving lesson today and as I was, I was following this dude, now me and my instructor (who is female) instantly presumed it was a female drver because the car in question was going down a national speed limit road (60mph) and 30, What Fun! Anyways a few junctions later and we were still stuck behind him, we'd been behind the fella for a good 5 minutes, it appears during all this time he had never bothered to use any of his mirrors, because suddenly at one junction he decided he had taken a wrong turn, no problem he thought, the nearest car is oh i dunno 3metres away, so he jsut slipped it into reverse, reversed backwards from the junction and then shuffled forward so he was on the correct side of the junction to turn.     &nbsp;   At this point I had to slam on and was close enough (i.e. a good 15cm) to figure out it was an old man [Shock!]. Kudos to him to realising that he had to change his position in the road so following cars will know what direction he is turning, cos after all he didnt use indicators, my only problem is if he would have actually looked, a mere glance for less than a second he woiuld have seen a learner driver coming up behind him at 60mph. So really Boy Racers? What ever, I'd rather have a nova boy revving his engine thinking hes cool however driving carefully because He and everyone else knows that if he crashes his insurance premiums will go sky high and he wont be driving again till he's 24.     &nbsp;   The Real boy racers are the gits who are fifty years old theyve been driving longer than ive been alive so they obviously own the road, and no matter how expensive their BMW is even if they crash they can afford it! Despite the fact that they havent seena c opy of the highway code in 35 years!

      Ok so I was just watching the news, and there are ALOT of the articles that pissed me off so lets talk:   First of all there was a girl who has started a website because she was gettin bullied, so what did the news do? they posted a picture of her on telly, now maybe its just me, but if i was bullying someone, then i came home and put the telly on and saw that bitch making a website about me kicking her ass, I would kick the crap outta her! F00!   Also theres a new leaflet being brought out telling us what to do in the case of an emergency, one of the things was that if a BioNuclear Weapon is dropped on your head and you get infected and start dying, do not try to go home, you must wait for decontamination, i mean really? Is it that important cos I wanna go put me feet up and watch bigbrother after Osama Bin Fudge Face has just given me leprosy!   Good Lord

       I need to start off apologising for all the different fonts in previous posts, thats cos im a noob to this blogger and i cba going back and fixing it!     &nbsp;   Anyways to the article:     &nbsp;   A few years back I was watching the news when the main headline was "Japan invents Digital Pet". What's this? Sounds interesting! Tamagotchi was its name and it hit the world hard, everyone wanted one, So I did some homework...         &nbsp;   A digital toy capable of simple Artificial Intelligence that acted jsut like a real pet, It got Hungry, It shitted, and had moods and toys for it to play with, OUTSTANDING i thought, they must cost a few bob, to my surprise they didnt, so i bought one. It kept me entertained for a few hours, Then i got extremely pissed off by its annoying none stop bleeping for attention, I cleaned I played and what did i get in return? No stroking licking or loving, jsut more shitty mess to clean up as I watched it grow another pixel bigger! Eventually I ended up trying to play fetch with it but it never came back, no great loss.     &nbsp;   So 5 or so years later when Tamagotchi Connexions was release I was relcutant to say the least, But my girlfriend wanted one and I wanted to see the new infrared capabilities so I bought one too, to be honest it is alot better, Tamagotchi are crap at advertising, I bet by the end of the next paragraph you will want one? Why because its no longer a Toy but a Game.     &nbsp;   Yes this New Line of incorrectly spelt Tamagotchi Connexions has more to offer, same old crying, pooing 10 pixel high gimp, but theres more styles, to the uglyness of your digital friend can vary, 2 Different Sexes are available, and using the IR communication, you can make friends, offer each other gifts, play games, become lovers and mroe importantly Mate.     &nbsp;   No I'm not a dirty Tamagotchi Fetish man, its just that the mating is the main part of the Game, Allow me to explain...     &nbsp;   The reason I am actually interested in this New Tamagotchi and why I am plannign on keeping the little darling is that its now a matter of endurance, When you first turn your tamagotchi on you are a 1G tamagotchi, a First Generation, If you find a lover and have babies, you are a second generation. and so on and so forth so the idea is not to keep the fella alive, but to keep it alive long enough to shag and have babies.     &nbsp;   I didnt realise how enthrauling this was until I was talking to my mate Jam and he mentioned he was on the fourth Generation, now he's had his longer than me but Jesus I want to get into competition and make my digital friend fuck like a horny virgin.     &nbsp;   And so I conclude you should all buy the new tamagotchi and all get competitive as I have its fun honest, they cost just over a tenner and unlike the real pets, you can be interested about them having sex without out sounded like a pervert and when you get bored, just do as Jay did and smash it with a hammer.     &nbsp;   Warning: No Tamagotchis were harmed during the writing of this article!

       I was watching a TV programme the other day, It was a silly kids show you know where they do crap puzzles and a retarded chimpanze could perform, anyways it was doing profiles on the kids and the usual stuff popped up: I like football, dont like school favourite colour is red, I like barbie, dont like boys, favourite colour green. Then the annoying one came.. Hi my name is [who gives a shit] I like playing with my friends and dont like George Bush.      Now I could be wrong here, but before I say anything this kid was ten years old, I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm probably right in saying that what the fuck does a ten year old kid who likes playing with her friends know about international politics?!?      I think its sick that kids get it drille dinto them that G.W. Bush is a bad man because he went to war with IRAQ, and if a kid asks why he went to war with Iraq its because of oil?  OIL ?      If a kid asks who the president is, or why we went to war, tell them the truth or tell them they'll find out when they get older, after all you dont tell your kids the postman is evil just because he does his job? Don't get me wrong the postman might fuck up everynow and then, you know sleep in one day or lose a few letters, but still you call him stupid not evil?! It's exactly the same for Bush, I'm not defending him, I believed in the War and I think its  damn  wrong to call Bush evil, Stupid, yes he is stupid, but he is not a bad man!      You cannot let a kid go on television a show which other children are watching and are influenced by and say something as serious and worrying as that, else we are gunna have a generation of rebels on our hands, who to be honest, won't know what they're rebelling against, or at least they wont understand it fully.      I can only think of two plausable reasons that the kid could have said this... One is that her parents told her to, you know totally scripted because her parents are tree hugging faggots who wouldnt understand why a dictatorship isn't good even if theyre Jewish grandparents died to stop one years ago. Either that or the kid has seen some shit like Newsround the bbc news for kids show, which implants it's bias bullshit views into the minds of young kids.      To be honest it could be blamed on anyone but the kid, as son as she said it she should have been put straight, and something as serious as that should not have been shown in a childrens programme, what the hell do editors do these days?      I hope someone sets the kid straight, and anyone who goes around saying they dont like George Bush without a fully understod and explainable reason should be slapped with a trout and stay out of poitics, its people like this that keep Tony Blair in power :(

       Just a quick on because Jay is bugging me to go play Worms Armageddon!      Anyways, you know it as soon as you walk in the joint who they are, they could be sat there in silence yet somehow you know that, that 12 year old pregnant scally and her girlfriend mates are going to be noisy as hell. I say girls because it always is.      If you havent guessed what I'm on about yet its when your sat in a nice civilised place such as a restataunt or library, and there is a group of people (usually teenage girls) causing unessacery noise. I'd say that it was annoying but its more than that, annoying is when you go down for a midnight snack and theres nothing in that you fancy, or when your about to play a game online with your mate, but a thunderstorm starts and you havta turn your pc off. Not being able to talk over a civilised meal which im paying a good £40/£50 to make the missus feel special and theres a gang of retardo sluts all sitting round a table drinking bacardi breezers witha  bag of crisps because they can legally drink witha 'meal'. Making a load of racket and disturbing everyone else, I jsut fail to grasp what right they think they have.      You know whats even worse than that, when you walk into a place like subway, sit down and all is nice and then the group in question normally girls again says something uber loud, because they want you to hear, they dont want you to think that they are actually talking to them, but they want you to hear, example:       *We all much on our subways*   John: Yum   Jay: Yeah   Charli: *Burp*      Annoying Girl 1: WHAT YOU MEAN YOU FANCY THAT LAD WITH THE HAIR      {Now this is a typical scally wag statement, notice how its in caps to show it is shouted, and her friend is sat, oh i dunno 6 inches away?! also note that the description is about as precise as a potato trying to hit a target with a spoon from half a mile away, everyguy turns round, not because they actually want to be fancied, simply to give them a look that suggests almost certain death, anyway lets carry on with teh scenario..}      Annoying Girl 2: EEEWWWW NO I DON'T      {O.k. so she doesnt, no big loss, after all she looks like she fell from the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down, and shes pregnant with a 12 year olds kid, which was more than likely concieved in the bus stop across the road the month before after a heavy session of drinking cider and smoking lambert and butler. Anyways whether or not she actually fancied anyone or not, no one cares, all you hear from teh rest of teh people in subway is a sigh of relief!}      Annoying girl 1: YEAH YOU DO YOU JUST SAID YOU DO      {Like Hello? no one cares, just shut the fuck up, but the worst is yet to come}      *Annoying Girl 2 gets up and kind of stumbles over towards our table, if your lucky and its early in the day and the double vision hasnt set in from the cider yet, you may get eye contact, but i doubt it, cos lets face it, who eats subway that early?}      Annoying Girl 2: Will you snog me?!      {Now Hold up what?! You sut said you didnt fancy this dude with the hair, and even if you did you can go toss over donkey droppings for all i care because there is not a snowballs chance in hell that those cyphalis ridden lips are going anywhere near any part of my body, and to be honest im rather worried about you standing so close to me and my food just incase there is a rare form of STI that can jump on to me or my food because lets face it, this bitch gets around and it doesnt matter how rare it is, if it exists, this bitch has it.}      And so i conclude how annoying people can be in places where you just cant be doing with all the hassle, i mean sometimes it aint so bad if its on the street and your just wandering by, in that instance your only worry is that the 6ft butch bitch called Wanda isnt going to twat us for turning her down, you can always just carry on walkuing and ignore them, chances are after a few paces the alcopop will kick in and they will forget what they are doing and fall over, but in a public place where all you wanna do is sit down and have a good chat and a bite to eat its not on, there should be a fast food joint with a dress code or something to keep the scallywags out.. and you know... people wonder why im not keen on McDonalds.. Ha!
