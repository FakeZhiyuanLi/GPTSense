      That was a depressing post back there. What a way to start! At some point tonite i need to be the attic monkey.  Here are ways i waste time:  IRC: fef.net channel #subgenius www.neopets.com Smoking Camel Lights Alt.slack The occasional Sci-fi Con Reading anything put on the shelf above the toilet Using toilet while reading Eating Salmon news.google.com trillian chatting with folks i know (using AOL, yahoo, ect via trillian)  (note: no i wont give you my IM addy. I dont know you. And i am tired of trying to humor folks who i dont know. If i know you THEN you get my IM Addy.)  Reading email. forwarding spam to isp's abuse dept (futility yes but fun) scritching the dogs ears talking on the phone. complaining, whining, bitching talking non -stop (even in my sleep)  ok.. thats a bit of my day. except the work part... i will talk about the work part in another post.

      Pissy, I miss you Lissa_Fae. You are too far away. We could go out and eat garlic bread and vegi thins and get gas. Then we could faht all nite and giggle like 5 year old children.  Actually I miss a lot of folks, the major disadvantage to being in the area I am living now, (besides the ungodly humidity and heat) is  the fact that all the folks I feel totally kewl around are AT LEAST 2 or 3 States NORTH of me.  The rest of the folks i like to see are in the damned northeast.. which when i lived in Virginia wasnt so bad, however now that i live 8-12 HOURS from virginia it SUCKS.  A simple weekend trip with a 8 hour drive to Ohio for example,  now take at least 16 hours., pretty much ruling that out all together...  Thats if I even had a car. Which I dont, well not really. I have a non-functioning 93 Toyota Pickup in the driveway. It has a bent frame and needs an alternator installed (in fact the alternator is in a box sitting in the truck right now).  Right now i catch a ride to work with Olebear.  Olebear is outta work, which means he can give me a ride to work, but also means shit SUCKS money-wise.  So we are broke, my credit was hosed long ago, and I have no vehicle. The few freinds I have made here in the area live on the FAR North side of town, where as i live on the FAR South side of town. Meaning its a 30 min drive to there houses, thru major city traffic and crap. And i cant ask them to come down here with out guilt, nor can i just ask Olebear to schlepp me up that far and come back later to get me. Feh.  Three things used to give me pleasure. Driving, Shopping and Eating.  I have no car and i have no money.....  And i cant eat shit...  I am cursed with a pissed off gallbladder full of stones and no health insurance. Which means every time I eat Fat in quantity I writhe about in pain some hours later as my gall bladder spasms, and in turn my whole back and chest clench up tightly.  Did i mention it was hot?  _pisces_

       urlLink  "Recent research has demonstrated that addicted rats have the same compulsive drive for cocaine as humans do. Two new studies, a French and a British one, show that rats can become addicted just like we do."     Well Duh. You just wasted a bunch of money, time and effort to PROVE SOMETHING WE ALL COULD TELL YOU! Add this one to the useless study department. I cant recall the state but a similar study pops to mind, one where the state in question spent a few million to determine "why prisoner would want to break out of prison". Lewis Black talked about that one too, and I agree with him that they could given any of us 2 bucks and we could have answered that question.  Oh and while I am thinking of it.. I understand when you make a movie of a comic character you need to take a few liberties to make things sell. This is understandable. HOWEVER, changing the characters NAME, how they gained their POWERS, and there PRIMARY MOTIVATION is NOT. It disrespects anyone who has ever worked on the character in comics, books even previous movies who attempted to maintain a sense of continuity to a character. If they suddenly make a scooby-doo movie where the lovable mutt was a poodle instead of a great Dane and motivated by his never ending love of Jesus and not by snacks and dinner, would the public still buy?  Probably, if they put the right big name actor in it. And don't EVEN get me started on ruining a good book.  _Pisces_

      So I installed Mandrake Linux on the system, I know its not the best distro but its a great "for idiots" starting point. After all you don't just get in a car when you three right? You have to learn to ride a bike first. I spent most of last nite figuring out how to configure and compile and program to find out this morning I did SOMETHING wrong. What I don't know. In addition I am so damned stressed I bit another hole in my gawderned lip again. *grrrrr*  Well I am gonna go shopping or something today, that something I don't know.. But I need to get out. Wonder if the crazies will want to go bar crawling after all?  -Pisces
