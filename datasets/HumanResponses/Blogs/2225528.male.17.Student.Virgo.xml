      Okler...I'll put up a post to keep Desmond happy. Or else...   Ever notice that when u dig deep into your memories, you can never recall the exact time when your memories first started? Like...when you first started having memories? Disturbing isn't it? We know from modern science that you couldn't possibly have memories as a newborn child, but still...don't you ever wonder where you were before you were born? We justify ourselves today by recalling the past and yet where we before all our memories started? Some staunch religious people may say, "Heaven, or purgatory." Yet it all seems vague to me.    Try and think back to your earliest memories, as a child maybe. In your mother's arms. Before that? And before that? Getting cloudy now, right? As hard as we try, nothing seems to come up to before we started having memories...before we were born. That's exactly what I'm talking about, "Where do our sub-conscious thoughts, or memories, lie before we exist?" A question that's been haunting me for seven years. And it still is. Hmm...something to think about in bed tonight, no?    it's the same thing as asking, "Hey, how many times do you blink in a day?" and seeing the person suddenly becoming aware of his blinking. Humorous and entertaining.

      erm.. spent my time reading quantum physics.. read a few websites.. i found this.. very short and simple to understand..   urlLink click here   .. which actually explain how time travel works eh.. but still.. i think it's impossible.. try this..    ......  MR DEZ  is someone VERY VERY VERY Good in physics.. one day.. he's suffering from depression.. he found out that his life is meaningless (that's what he's been doing always).. he decided to kill himself.. but he doesn't have the gut.. (that's him, too).. so.. since he's so damn good in physics.. he decided to kill he younger self.. he made his decision to travel back time with a time machine that he'll create.. and kill his ownself 10 years ago... here's the catch.. AS soon as he made the decision.. he saw someone appears.. around the age of 28, looks like himself.. but a bit older.. holding a gun.. and shoot right into his head... he's dead  ok..  probably.. when mr dez decided to invent a time machine.. he's already making a starting point. mr dez spent 10 years inventing one.. and finally go back 10 years ago.. when he's 18.. and killed himself... now, tell me.. if he's murdered by himself at 18.. how come he can actually lived until 28 and created the time machine and go back 10 years later and killed his ownself?  now smarties, genuises and physicist wanna bes.. DO NOT EVER try to make a decision to create a time machine and go back kill yourself. Who knows.. you might see your older self appearing.. and kill you, now?  look behind you..

      ok i went to swinburne.. something like a FrontPage Workshop. When i reached there the lecturer was asking me where was i from.. by looking at my white shirt and brown pants, he assumed that i'm from CHUNG HUA!! arggghh! nvm.. during the session.. my stupid friend visited a website.. my school website.. the lecturer asked him who did it.. and all the ppl from my school pointed at me.. and so.. i was disqualified for the web design competition... ended up being a judge :/

      I have no idea how to express myself now.. today for me is the most pissed off day of my frigging life (for now).. so fucking mad! I was supposed to meet up with my friends at the State library having said that my friend would pick me up.. as a result of his fucking stingy reluctant attitude of not wanting to pick me up, he ended up at ANOTHER library himself and deserted me after what I have gone through the whole morning before! Before the deserting incident from that fagg, I was ordered around doing this, doing that till I was pissed by EVERYTHING that happened.. adding to the deserted situation, that made me even more mad.. and ended up my plan B of going to the library has fled away.. ArGH..!! then I had a stupid engagement dinner to attend.. Ugh! it was AGAIN another misfortunate incident for me.. turns out I was invited there last minute as I was forced to be the substitute of one of the "absent" guest, hmmph.. that (arrogant brat).. what pisses me off is the fact that I dun have a proper attire to attend that stupid dinner as my clothes are all at my home..! Ended up wearing a stupid 3 quarter jean pants with a red T shirt and a sandal.. *tears*.. TO MAKE THINGS WORST, during the dinner, I had to accompany my uncle everywhere.. I mean EVERYWHERE! Having said that I had no proper clothes, I had to "bodyguard" the man around the hall to mingle to his old mates in accordance to the showing of my sleezy, lame, cheap, and IMproper clothes.. to make things even MORE worst, a stupid cameraman and his assistant flashed a bloody huge bright light my table directing AT me taking "memorable moments", debuting my first On Screen showing of my pathetic attire which also marks the end of my social string BIG TIME! -_-" God...! Give Me Strength..This time, I MEAN IT..! Ugh.. I'm so fucked up now.. tell me what should I do to get rid of these negative "Aura"s?? Feng Shui? Star Signs? Prayers? -_-" I doubt it would work anyway *sigh*..   Anyway, starting school next monday morning after two weeks break from school.. I reckon there wouldn't be any frequent postings on the blog for the time being.. BUT! all Co-Bloggers!in other words, buddies of mine..! do post something in okay.. also tag in messages on the TagBoard on the right..! u guys will hear more postings bout high school times.. :Ã¾ so blog in at http://beaned.blogspot.com frequently alrite.. ciao guys..

Anyway I just got back from that & it was quite satisfactory... despite the fact that I was miles away from the stage(damn u wei loong for being late =p). That & most of kuching's female population turned out. A short dialogue of four guys surrounded by hot chicks :   russ: yo, 12 o'clock...  wei loong: yeah. okler... not bad. the one behind u better.   tee hiong: where? *blur*   ervin: yeaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh~~!!!!

TH: wtf... I can't see a damn thing...  ervin: omg... jolin's dancing is so... so... so... *drools somemore*  russ&WL: *siiiiiiiighhhh*  That's about how it went 'round the middle of the show. After that paid more attention to Jolin & her background dancers 'cos the songs were starting to pick up and got more jumpy. Go get her CD now. Worth it... for some songs. Hahahaha. Run dun walk to Kenyalang now. LolZ. Short note: Jolin's dancing rocks. Go buy her VCD too. ~^^~  On a side note, I wanna ferret. My friend in KL has one and its the coolest looking pet ever. Damn. Unique... wonder if you can get one ova here? Any ideas? LolZ.   The weekend is here ! Yay ! Sleeping at 2 a.m never felt so good.   ~Fin.

      THe library. u call that a place to study?! more like a place for sick mental patients undergoing recovery.. :/ well, can't deny that we COULD actually achieve full concentration there, erm.. sorta.. Haha.. that is IF none of my friends were there. Yeah.. I did manage to go to the library alright, did some of my work.. BUT I just can seem to get all the points out of my head and put it into words that I'm supposed to write.. gosh.. In NeeD OF ENgLIsh TuItIon man! LoL.. at least still, I got some of my stuff done ;) tonnes more waiting for me to accomplish.. gosh.. speaking about studies! Ugh.. my physics teacher by the way sucked totally in teaching! I couldn't keep my eyelids up during his lessons.. argH! early revision proved to work for me though... FOR NOW! Anyways.. at least today I still had some of my work done.. ;)  I really need to get this out of my fucking soul..! OMG..! Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban, GOSh..believe it or not.. the much anticipated sequel SUCKED! ya heard me! spelled S.U.C.K.E.D..! they din show the full quidditch match.. some scenes were cut out from the book..! and the movie's just about merely 2 hours compared to the last 2 prequels which is obviously more than that..! There's nothing we can do but to blame that bloody director, Alfonso Cuaront.. Obvioulsy we can't blame the actors rite? They all just look too damn good..! Shrek 2's my next target on the big screen..I just can't stand people talking about Shrek 2 knowing that I haven't watched it.. hmmph.. aRGh! just can't stand the constant naggings behind.. need to get ready for bed or else I'm toasted.. literally! Signing Off~!

       Is it love tonight When everyone's dreaming Of a better life In this world Divided by fear We've gotta believe that There's a reason we're here Yeah, there's a reason we're here  Cause these are the days worth living These are the years we're given And these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives  See the truth all around Our faith can be broken And our hands can be bound But open our hearts and fill up the emptiness With nothing to stop us Is it not worth the risk? Yeah, is it not worth the risk?  Cause these are the days worth living These are the years we're given And these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives  Even if hope was shattered I know it wouldn't matter Cause these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives  We can't go on Thinking it's wrong To speak our minds I've gotta let out what's inside  Is it love tonight When everyone's dreaming Can we get it right? Yeah, well can we get it right?  Cause these are the days worth living These are the years we're given And these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives Even if hope was shattered I know it wouldn't matter Because these are the moments These are the times Let's make the best out of our lives

      Einstein's theory of relativity to time for me, means there's hope for time travel.. (GOsh that made me sound so lame).. at least that's what I think.. we've all done things that we've regret and hope we've never done before and wish that we could turn back time to set everything straight again, TIME TRAVEL.. but, we were being naive, I realised making mistakes is one of the factors in shaping one's personality.. Ha.. Ha.. (sarcastically) ya, that's true.. although it sucks to hear the truth, it is the truth :/ anyway, what is done is done.. there's no turning back.. as said in Ashton Kutcher's The Butterfly Effect... but we can do something about it.. by preventing ourselves from doing things that we would regret.. I know I CAN'T do it, u KNOW urself.. people make mistakes all their lives.. well, at least that's what we've or I've been practically trying to do for LiFe..!  Started studying for my math..WOOHoOO!! LoL.. and guess what!? had some help from the geekiest and nerdiest, WOoPz!! I meant the coolest and smartest kid around the block.. no other than Gordon Ho! *grins* Haha.. yUpz.. helped me in logarithms and indices.. that really sucked, those Operators and Exponentiations can really call in for a headache! dun even get me started on Trigonometry!! well.. tomorrow I'll b heading to the library to put into use the other 5 % of my brain which is dormant btw..! :/ GoSh.. that is if my friends are reluctant or willingly enough to drive me there.. damn it's late.. ARGH! I can't wait to finish my homework at the library tomorrow! well, that is IF my brain is following :/ *YaWnZ* Nitez! ciao..

       same thing today as usual.. woke up.. drove to school and attended computer class.. then rushed back home for lunch.. at 12.30pm next thing ya know, Chemistry tuition at 2pm.. it's my least favourite time of the day, imagine wherever u're headed, rows of red lights forming barracades and cars moving as slow as particles.. well.. let's see at least I learnt something today.. did I?    Sent my friend home after hanging out at the mall, sped back home.. for no specific reason for why I'm doing it.. I created a pencil sketched Jpeg format picture of me through "intensive and extensive" touch-ups by photoshop judging by the horrendous pictures I've taken.. and uploaded into  urlLink friendster .. took me about 1 hour for it to be done.. imagine that.. but I'm pretty pleased with what I did.. although I'm not that pleased with the face in the picture.. a good friend of mine claims that it doesn't really look like me.. sigh..

       Today was supposed to be my nite off from my never-ending misery of constant stares on the blackboard, not&nbsp;to mention occasional&nbsp;projector screens.. but since I'm dead broke and miserable.. ended up driving out with  urlLink ken  "makan angin".. today just wasn't my night...    &nbsp;  Sometimes life&nbsp;can't be&nbsp;what u want it to be.. it's really hard to cope with this "long and winding road" without misleading urself.. all u can rely on are only ur friends&nbsp;and people that cares..&nbsp;Thinking back.. I wonder.. am I actually alone in this world or is there anyone or anything that's worth living for? LoL.. well answer's pretty obvious.. NOTHING..    &nbsp;  Pressing&nbsp;the keys on the keyboard now at&nbsp;T1 cybercafe at 3rd mile with my buddy.. One's a total online game freak and one's a net surfer.. guess which one's me..&nbsp;the staff's&nbsp;pulling down the panes and me and my friend still stuck to the monitor screen..     &nbsp;  left..    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

      i'm behind my parents.. dad was driving.. i'm listening to my dad's engine while he changed the gear from 3 to 4... i looked up.. i saw 11:11am.. very familiar.. coz i always see 11:11am on the clock in my car.. couldn't be bothered..   i woke up early in the morning.. brushed my teeth.. washed my face.. ate my breakfast.. when to schoool.. boring subject started my boring day.. BM.. then Physics.. and BI.. then history.. during history i asked my friend.. 'what time woi.. sien ar.. when's the bell gonna ring?'. 'fuck you look at your own watch.. ' he said.. i forgot.. my watch was on my wrist... who cares.. just glanced through my watch.. saw the time.. and continued listening to my teacher. talking about boring parliments..   wait... what was the time again....&nbsp; it was 11:11am.. i looked back.. from 11:11am it changed to 11:12..&nbsp; for the second time.. i didn't care much about what time it was.. the only thing i knew was 48 minutes more for the last bell to ring.  i reached home...in the car.. asked my mom.. 'sometimes.. 11:11 really caught our attention yeah? '11:11 that's the only time with 4 digits the same.. 22.22 are hard to see... you don stay up that late.. and.. there's no 22.22am? as there're 11.11am and pm.. you see them more often' she replied. 'but.. you see them don you?' .. 'yeah.. last night..' she answered.  after supper.. i switched on my laptop.. connected to the internet.. and surfed the net.. went to.. of course  urlLink www.house-o-celebs.com  to check if there's any updates.. and cnn.com.. and so...o..  there's this site.. explaining crop circles.. and there.. i could feel.. like a cube of ice.. ran behind neck in 0.1 seconds... and the wated from the ice dipped on both my hands.. cold..

       so there i was at the local cinema with popcorn/mineral water in hand waiting in line for the 10.15 king arthur show on a wednesday night. damn lucky...there were only 2 good seats left & me and my neighbor just happened to get those 2 seats. at rm5 each...the wonders of wednesday night movies. couldn't believe my luck...there was this guy ahead of us but he didn't buy it...wonder why. hmmm. anyways, we were there waiting for the cineplex doors to open up to the throngs of happy movie watchers, leng luis, annoying ppl who comment on every damn thing that goes on in the movie loudly, etc etc. so then my neighbor starts talking bout stuff...and for some reason i drop my half of regular sized popcorn to the fall, and its contents begin to spill out all over the entrance of the cinema doors. there was this long silence like "...........................". so quiet you could hear the wind blowing. all you could hear was me going "f*ck! shit soi ar!".     &nbsp;   then everyone stared at me...then at the floor which was covered with wonderful honey-coated popcorn. you could almost hear the workers going "aduh...kimak ali budak tok...bikin kerja lebih". sigh...wonderful. we wanted to redeem my embarrassment by ripping off the "Honey" poster after the movie but was foiled by the mentioned cinema workers who were still giving me the eye. an AVP poster would've been nice too...the one with the Alien on it. but damnit at 12.30am there were still ppl hanging 'round the counter facing all the posters. shit. a "Honey" poster would have looked damn gaya in my room, hot babe and all. it was my neighbor's idea. really.     &nbsp;   later that night was kept awake my images from the trailers of "The Sisters" and "The Village". bloody freaky.     &nbsp;   oh, and king arthur was a pretty gaya film.     &nbsp;    &nbsp;

      ArgH.. it's been like hell these few days.. my homework's piling up.. dun even get a single crap what my chemistry teacher's blabbering about (just to make things clear, it's her problem, not mine..) all my teacher seems to be amateurs.. sigh THanks to the excellent administrative arrangements in our school.. :/   Forced to do a physic experiment today based on a stupid INCOMPLETE classic typo photocopied piece of paper.. did it alrite, ended up with no idea on how to finish the bloody report.. honestly, I could care less.. hmmph.. Homework's been like hell.. two separate subjects for Math (imagine that!), Graph for PA and Physics, Chemistry tuition homeworks.. adding on more for the whole week.. it's a miracle I'm still breathing..   Considering hard on whether to take the interview on the second batch Prefect.. hmm.. It's a Freedom thingy kinda dilemma.. something like either choosing to live in a democratic human life or the animalistic dog-colar life thingy.. get what I mean? For prefects, no offense.. really, u're doing a great job! *cough cough*.. :Ã¾   The competition last saturday was an utter disaster.. wait, hold on.. it wasn't.. because, NOTHING HAPPENED!! The headmaster fled to Manila on the last minute and the competition cannot be continued without the "majesty" 's presence.. leaving a whole burden on our Radio Club as we had ordered a huge amount of lunch food with a debt of RM1000+.. Thanks to the school.. hmmph.. I think they should've resolved the problem by now, hopefully.. Anyway.. for those involved.. the competition will be postponed till further notice..   Sigh.. 30 minutes spent on typing this post and 7 hours, 10 minutes, 16secs left till 12am for me to finish my studies and homework..   Lord give me strength..

       Fragile seams,  I opened up too quick and all my dreams,  Were walking out I'd slowly,  Lost my fire,  With every single man a river cried,  I had no sensation,  Completely numb,  left with no satisfaction,  I thought no-one could ever get me high again,  I swear,  I was not looking,  Oh,  waited so long,  I thought the real thing was a fake,  I thought it was a tool to break me down,  You proved me wrong again,   (Chorus)  If love were liquid it would drown me,  In a placeless place would find me,  In a heart shape come around me and then melt me slowly down,  If love were human it would know me,  In a lost space come and show me,  Hold me and control me and then,  Melt me slowly down,  Like chocolate,   Tastes so good,  My heart's been mended who'd have thought it would,  An empty bet and still I won the cash,  A man who I love and who,  Loves me back,  Oh,  waited so long,  For love to heal me so I'd feel it,  Thought it wasn't breathing then you came,  You proved me wrong again   (chorus x 2)   Like chocolate come here,  Zoom in,  catch the smile,  There's no doubt it's from you,  And I'm addicted to it now,  Just one look boy to melt me down,  Just one heart here to save me now,  Your candy kisses are sweet I know,  Hold me tight baby don't let go,  Just one look boy to melt me down,  Just one heart here to save me now,  Your candy kisses are sweet I know,  Hold me tight baby don't let go.

      for the first time since this year.. today, I was late..  went to my aunt's place after school yesterday till late midnight since no one's willing to bring me home.. spent a ridiculous 12 bucks for a cab ride back.. apparently I guess that's the main reason why I was late for school today.. my usual handphone alarm clock wasn't set and my brain was still unfortunately sleeping..  school was boring.. learnt nothing.. spent most of the time talking in class ignoring the existence of the teacher.. first exam's this friday and I have yet to even touch the pages of my math, even looking at it seems impossible..  tomorrow... another day to live.. today... another day to end..

       ...i am quitting mRO.      after thinking things over and weighing the good against the bad, i have finally decided that spending rm38 each month is just a waste of money, and that playing/botting endlessly to gain lv's in mRO is extremely pointless and completely devoid of reward and most importantly...FUN.       seeing that most players, including me, are literally forced to bot to gain exp lv's as well as money because of the absurdly high exp rates i believe it is quite a waste of time, as botting is completely devoid of experiencing the game as players just have to let the bot run to gain lv's. sure, the first 50-60 lv's are easy enough to earn. try leveling at lv70+. even at full bot(24-48 hours) the most you'll be able to gain would be max 2-3 levels. all is right for now. what about level 80+ above? you do the math. my point is, while most players are on desktops computers & ADSL connections which enable them to bot for hours at end, it is completely devoid of experiencing the game as a whole. the experience tables for RO, i assure you, are 2-3 times higher then any other online game out there. sure, you could reach lv99 after maybe 3-4 months, but the whole point of a MMORPG(Massively Multiplaer Online Role Playing Game) is to socialize, make friends and of course, have fun. which brings me to my next point.      in mRO, i am sad to say, the games text translation is so bad that it seems that all the game text was translated, at best, by a Form 3 student. and i happen to know some f3 students with better vocabulary then the whole mRO GM team put together. most of the game players are so terrible at social skills that the whole point of socializing online gets degraded to meaningless conversations which roughly boils down to "I have a better character than you. Better items too. And i have a game GF who I've never seen b4 in real life but who cares, I am l33t ur not. Haha". don't believe me? Try heading to the PvP rooms at any given time of the day &amp; you'll see my point.       if that's not enough, hacks & full botters abound! mRO players please take no offence as i do not refer to anyone in particular. just that the mRO GM team should make an effort to stop these hackers and botters. i realize i am a botter too, but why do i bot? read paragraph 2. in iRO(international RO) GM's and sub-GM's actually walk around in-game to catch botters, cheaters and abusers who totally spoil the overall gaming experience. go ahead and check out the iRO site and see for yourself.       screw this. i'm heading for those private servers where killing 10 fabres gets you to lv50+ no problem. i'm heading there for the rewarding virtual items. i'm heading there to play for free instead of paying rm38 to bot. i'm heading there where, even if unofficial, GM's ban &amp; suspend botters. i'm heading there to meet in-game girls who are well informed, and who do not come off as Ah Lians at first glance. i'm heading there where most of my enlightened friends are already having guild wars at a regular basis(suck on this mRO playas!) and where not everyone is a complete jerk off. i'm heading there to have FUN.       i can't believe it took me a year and 4 months to realise this. oh well. trial and error i guess.       *  while most of this blog consists mainly of my complaints, take note however, that most of this blog is FACT. if you've played it long enough, you'll believe me. oh, and for those guilds who keep "sapu-ing" the PvP rooms, i hope someone teaches them a lesson in ruining the whole PvP experience. those bastards.                ~fin~
