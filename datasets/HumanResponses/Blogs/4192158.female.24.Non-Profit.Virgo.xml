       Tomorrow is the due date. So far, zero pain, zero signs of labor. I have never wanted to be in pain so badly! So, I get to see the doctor and have her probe her fingers in my hoo-ha. On the Glutton for Punishment comfort scale, I give this a hefty 5--and I only give it a five because I know more discomfort is on its merry way. It's far worse than the regular pap smear examination.   I don't care what other women say; one never gets used to having her feminity examined under a bright light while in stirrups. When I used to go once a year, I would psych myself up by saying it won't be that bad, it's only once a year, etc. And I would be doing great--even with my feet in the stirrups, which are so kindly covered in "socks" with birth control pill logos on them just to remind me the real reason I am here: so I don't get knocked up. Then the doctor tells me to scoot my butt down. That's the kicker, because up to that point you don't feel quite so open. And you aren't. But you have to be open to be examined and with a silent whimper I scoot down and destroy what is left of my dignity. Luckily, most doctors are quick about it--honestly, that must be a sucky part of the job, right?

       First off, let it be known that I have basically the best husband around. But.....two days together in house is two too many. Plus, he's sick, so he turns into an incompetent little boy. God love him. Somehow, he loses the ability to put the peanut butter knife in either the sink or the dishwasher--both of which are a mere 4 feet away. And then there's the coffee nipple. That's the little spot on the counter that his coffee stirring spoon makes. How I loathe the coffee nipple.    But I digress, because he bought me a Dyson vacuum cleaner,"because you don't ask for much and you deserve it." I know most people would not consider a vacuum being a good gift, but as you will learn, I am a total dork. This is the coolest vacuum on the face of the planet. Check it out:  urlLink www.dyson.com . I have the DC07. It even has an attachment the looks like a gun. Really kicks ass and will never lose suction. You wouldn't believe how much stuff this thing picks up. Dyson for President!

       Trapper could be here any day now.    We are now two days away from the due date.  That's the supposed date that doctors give you to tell you when your baby will be here.  They should call it "your-life-can-begin-again" date.  I had this little life going last year--you know, go to work, come home, spend money, eat, etc.  And while I did all that while I was pregnant, it was all in anticipation or maybe a practice run for "real life."  It almost invalidates the last 4 years of my life as a grown-up.  Soon, I will be Mommy.  A title I asked for but have no clue what to really do.  And if I hear one more person tell me it will come to me, I'll just puke.  I like to know.  Research.  Plan.  So that's why the name of this blog is "Without a Net."
