       Music: "demonic"or "devil music" as my mom would call it...       well today was a horrible day...and i have no idea why. i don't know what's wrong with me. lately i've been having these really bad mood swings. one minute i'll be perfectly fine...laughing and everything and the next i'll be so upset i can't stand it. i guess it has to do with everything going on lately. if you're close to me then you know about it. i guess it sort of had to do with what me and brandon were talking about last night. something that i'd rather not think about. i'd rather clear it out and never thing of it again. i think i'm way to freakin sensitive. i wish i could freakin change who i am. the way it think about things. the way i drive myself crazy with the stupidest shit that's going on. but i  am  proud of myself for one thing. i've given up on the solutions i used to take when i was sad or upset or angry. i've dedicated my time i used to spend trying to plan a way to hurt myself into drawing and i'm pretty damn good at it too. and of course now that i'm back on the dance team that takes up some time too. i really enjoy dancing...i'm good at that too. i've had so many people ask me if i've had lessons and hell no this comes natural...100%. lol. i don't mean to brag...well yes i do but i am talented in the arts. lol. but anyways...i just need a good concert with my bestest best friend in the whole wide world to make me feel  so much better ...i can't wait!      *6 MORE DAYS!* yeah buddy.   i'm so in love...with you.    -mikayla-

      Music: duality - slipknot   well i bet you all know who my best friend is...she's someone who has always been there for me. she has always offered her shoulder for me to cry on. she's the only one i can come to with my problems and actually help me fix them or at least make them seem better. i've never found anyone like her. she is unreplacable. i'm gonna be honest with you i  have  tried to let her go once but i couldn't stand it. i can't live without her. i practically grew up with this girl. i can never let her go. she has become more than just a friend or best friend at that. she's my sister. we have everything in common and we've shared to much to let go now.  Cayce, girl i love you. i'm never gonna make the mistake of letting you go ever again. because it is impossible to live without you. you're my sister. i'm here for you to talk to any time you need me and i know i can talk to you. *we heya*    7 more days baby!!!! whooohooooo!    i love you cayce...forever.    *mikayla*

      Music: what's happening-ying yang twins    i didn't go to school today because i went to get my learners...and i passed! so i'm a driving machine now. i drove home and then out to eat. it was just as easy as i thought. but we had to sit at the DMV office for 3 hours strait. it was so boring. and plus i didn't feel good. my allergies are acting up again...damn ragweed. (whatever that is) lol. but anyway that's just about it. i hope i feel better for tomorrow night! i can't wait...i'm gonna be hangin with my boys all night long (including my baby!) so it's gonna be a good night. ;)  *9 more days!*      -mikayla-

      Music: slipknot   well my day was pretty good...i had all my hard classes today...geometry...omg that's a whole different story, that class is a major headache. but anyway, i was a little tired all day so it was kinda a drag but i had all of my funny friends around me to keep me awake. john and michael, you guys are so darn funny. michael's a stupid taco!! lol. the walk home was like hell...yes yes it is across the street but you try being 3 feet tall and walk up a hill with a 40 pound bookbag on. lol. but seriously it was tough for me. i'm gonna have like the biggest calf muscles by the time this year is over! but anyways that my day, i'll probably make another post tonight because i'm going to eat with purple gramps (tomorrow's her birthday!) my purple gramps is all growed up!   i'm out like a fat kid playing dodgeball...     *mikayla*

       Music: the cd nic burnt for me!...really hot tunes!         well this is my new journal because i have DSL now! finally, well i've always had it, it's just been in a box in my closet... but anyway today has been grand i guess. i mean all my classes were alright...i didn't do much just took notes and read alot. not to shabby. but i learn some new stuff in German which is so cool. oh and he (my teacher) was playing some German techno that was so awesome. i went up and asked him where he finds his music. oh and me and my friend Luke had to get up in front of the class and greet each other in German and my teacher decided to change my name...so i will be refered to as Brunelda from now on. okay? lol. but anyways i think that German is my favorite class this year. i learned how to say i love you and give me a kiss. i'll be using those alot i can tell! ;) . well anyway, i'll probably be making post from now on...like everyday to tell you guys (who are interested) how my day went...   be looking for my new post tomorrow...because i'm out.     *mikayla*
