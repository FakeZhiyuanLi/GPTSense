      jokes and remark directed at you in bad taste should deflected with good humour. this is one way to avoid enmity with anybody. losing your cool while playing the game will cause you to become strung up. you will forfeit a possible win. that will even spoil the pleasure of those watching the game. there is no way that you can change everyone in this world to your way of thinking. it is not even desirable. if everyone agrees with you the world will soon run out of ideas. there are many ways of correcting a person when he is wrong. by critscising blaming and railing at him in public you will be humiliating at him rather than correcting him one is certain to make more enemies through critiem. if you can show concern for a person with kind words, he will thank you for it someday. never use harsh or unpleasant words whenever you express your views on certain issues. diplomacy, gentleness and politness do not hurt anybody. in fact they will open many doors for more effective communciation. do not feel defensive when your own faults are pointed out. your fault are signposts for learning perfection. termper is a poor camouflage for shortcomings. when someone loses their temper, he will blurt out too many things which are better left unsaid. never reveal a former friend's personal secret, no matter how angry you are with him now. you will only degrade yourself in the process and others would neva acept you as a sincere friend thereafter.others will think that you could do them the same thing that you did to hurt a former friend, no one will trust you.

      you should not come to any hasty decision regarding any matter when you are in a bad mood or under provacation. any decision or conclusion reached during such a period would be a matter that you could regret one day... allow your mind to calm down 1st and think... then judgement will be an unbiased one... cultivate tolerance helps you to sympathise with other ppl troubles... avoid unneccessary criticism... try to realise that even the finest human being is not infallible. the weakness that you find in your neighbour can be found in yourself... it has been said that you should not throw stones at others while staying in glass houses...

      i myself also dunno what is it for... is it good for you or bad for you... nobody can ans this question... it is up to you to decide... you can choose to be happy with tat person but you also can choose not to... however i belive that a lot ppl think that love and being love is a very xin ku thingy... nobody wanna get it but also at the same time they dun wanna it... when they fall in love wit the person who the person dun like them they are so sad which actually wondering why they could not get them... or they may even think that why they choose to love the person... they will think that if i do not know him or her that will be wonderful... but if really there no love at all dun you find are boring... now i begin to wonder what is love... why i am in love... sometime i really wonder why am i a human being which i everyime say i am a ghost... i dun wanna be human being at all... being a human you need to vex so many thing... especially for love... i dun like it at all... but what can i do... this is fate... now i am gettin lost... i dunno which way to go... this really make me wonder... can i choose not to know anybody especially for him... i also dunno... i too love him... but what can i do... nothing... i dunno what to do at all... i am now so stress that sometime i dunno what i am doin... there is a gal which i dun really wanna mention... she gonna cracy... she commit sucide cuz her mother know that she have a boyfreind and she stoping them to meet... her mother now everday come to sch to spot check on her... i know this is hurt and were force not to love each other but ending your life is not good at all... this is the worst matter you doing... if you really die you willing to see him cry for you... you willing to see your friend all worry about you... if you really love him go for it... i am sure your parents will know one... there are the other couple that i know also... we tot that they are always the best couple... cuz we think that they will not quarrel at all as we neva know... however they have break as the gal always like to quarrel which make that guy think that the gal dun understand hime at all... but he actually also dunno that he himself also dunno the gal will enough... the gal think that he is too close wit one of his galfriend which make her uneasy... but it is truth that they were togather but only as a friend... i think tat both dun understand each other well enough and cause them to break... do you think it is worth it... i dun think so... sometime i did really wonder why do couples like to quarrel... isnt this hurting enough... but look at the other way round... if they no quarrel you will neva get to know each other better...

      guys also like to say that to their galfriend or the gal they like"i willing to wait for you... i only love you... you are my one and only..." isnt this full of crap... there is no promise of that... you can promise that after you break up you will not go find other gals... when you know that the guy dun like you n you dun stand any chance you will go find other gals as well... i dun like ppl make empty promise... if the guys who promise... it is not good to listen... it may not be the truth... they may tell you that you are their one and only... the next day find other gals... this is lame...

      what type of friend you like most... there are no one who are perfect at all... not even friend or the ppl you like... friends maybe the worst nightmare or it may be a sweet dream for you... like friend can take you for advantage... and also they will also backstad you... friends have different type... most parents dun like their children to mix with bad sccompany like those ah lian and ah beng... in this ah lian n ah beng world.. there  are ppl who are also good too.. they will not teach you the bad thing as they think that they are bad enough... they dun wanna her other friend be like them... they indeed have good heart... but though she or he is gangster... the other type are the type that will teach other the bad thing which they think that this is cool... everybody  should be like them... however for those who are guai guai type there are also divide into good and the bad part... those good part also those who are like angel... teach you the good... dun let their friend go astray... however the other type is those who like to backstab and those take friend for granted... lie to their friend as and when their like... be the one who ppl think everybody will like it... this is the type of friend i hate most... so you belong to which type of friend...

      there a gal name christ... she doesn't belive that she will fall in love with the guy who name calvin... as she think that they can only be friend... as the guy do not suit her and he is quite flirt... at first she dun like him at all lor... as calvin is thode type of flirt... however they get to meet everyday as their friend also ask them out as usual... she slowly then realise that she like him and slowly having feeling with calvin...but at that point of time... calvin had a girlfriend... so she decided to keep quiet and dun say anything... beside he have a galfriend, their friend jane also like him... christ think that she might not stand a chance as she is not pretty and also close to calvin like jane so close to him... she can only see what they do and sometime also dun really know what they are saying as they share lots of secret... one day he called christ say that her galfriend wanna break with him cuz she dun like him and find the other guy liao... he cry the whole day... christ was so sad to see him like that cry... she dunno how to console him... she only can lend him her shoulder... she feel so pain... jane also there to console her... the next day calvin called christ that he get over it already cuz he think that his galfriend dun treasure him so he dun think he wanna treasure her too... that is when calvin also have the same feeling for christ... they always out and they also neva really call jane out too... calvin always send christ home after her lesson... one day they were at pasir ris park with jane... they were nothing better to do and suggest to play truth or dare... dunno is god play game with them or what... everytime christ and calvin will also get the dare... they dare them to kiss and many more... the next day jane call christ say that she was not happy about the dare thing as she really like calvin... christ dunno what to do at all... she wondering how... can she really put away the feeling for calvin... finally one day calvin admit that he like her and wanna her to be her galfriend... a lot of thing clashes into her mind... like she can accept him... he is damn flirt... and also how she going to face jane... but she herself did have the feeling with him... what to do... in the end she accept him as she always do the way she like... this relationship started here... they did not let jane know as they scared that jane will get angry and sad over it...thing did not go really smoothly at all... after a few weeks jane had found out their relationship...at first she was angry but she say neva mind but just give them the blessing... however nobody know that jane is trying to spoil this relationship... when they quarrel christ will call jane what happen... she will just say some bad comment to both calvin and christ... that one time that christ ask jane to explain everything and what happen to calvin as she know that she is wrong... jane had promise her... but when jane go to calvin she did not say anything... christ was so upset... she did not know that her friend was like that... the only thing she know was to commit suicide... cause her friend betray her and also calvin dun wanna pick up the phone to let her have the chance to explain... she went to 7 eleven to buy panadol... she swallow 11 panadol together as she had gastric and she cannot manage to eat so many... after a few hours calvin finally call her and let her expland and forgive her too... but christ did not know let calvin know that she trying to commit suicide... the next day  christ keep on vomit and was so pale... her friend saw her like tat... she quickly bring her to see a doctor... she need to have some injection to see if her lung was affected... and calvin then realise that she had commit suicide... he then know how much love him... christ think that this maybe the end of everything... she tot that calvin will always with her as she neva really contact jane... suddenly calvin ex galfriend called her when calvin was in camp... she say that she is calvin galfriend and she feel boring wanna find somebody to acc her... christ was totally shock and feel like collapse... she could neva think that she had been two time by calvin... she think that she treat him well... love him why he still wanna two time on her... she dunno how to face debbie who was calvin other galfriend now... christ did tell him before that if he still like debbie go ahead with her... she will not stop them together but she will just disappear...  calvin say tat no... he dun like debbie anymore... christ dunno whether to trust him or her own feeling... in the end she choose to trust him... but what did she get now... calvin bluff her... she was real sad... no matter how calvin say she just dun wanna listen... she dunno what to do... in the end she make up her mind... she continue this relationship but she wanna a revenge on him... since tat she also got ppl who was after her which also her ex boyfriend... however days and week passes... she could not have the courage to take revenge... she love him so much... in the she give up to take revenge on calvin and debbie... she tot that as long as she love him and he could see it he will in the end choose her... but she did not know that the worst part happen... debbie was in her school go round spreading that christ was the 3rd party and snatch away her boyfriend... christ dunno what to do... she was angry with calvin tat he promise to get over with debbie but he neva do it... christ dunno what to do at all... she had to keep quiet... when ppl ask her is it truth she neva say anything... because calvin dun like to let other gal know that they were together... she somtime was thinking... why isnt she given a place for her... she like nobody in calvin world... this is bad for her... plus debbie still keep on spreading that she was the 3rd party... she really feel like giving up... in the end she nevs... she just love him and she think that she should love him the way he is... but dun you think that this in not good for her at all... nobody know what she thinking... one day calvin say that he was charge because he had sex with debbie who actually underage... christ was sad... she dunno how long calvin will be jail... she just prayed hard for him... in the end... the god did listen to her prayer... calvin was only charge for 6 month... she dunno whether to be sad or happy... she feel very lonely foe the next few months... ppl got ask her why she should wait since tat he not good to her... and also he had a record for being jail... the ans always the same... "no matter how long or how far is he... i will stil wait for him... i dun care is it worth it not... but i only trust my feeling... also if i really regret to wait for him or we even break up at least i know i did put the effort in and also i had nothing to regret as she did love him b4 and deeply..." that the end... any comment on this story... dun you think that this gal is stupid or she is the gal you wanna... willing to give in everything for love...

      我知道故事不会太曲折 我总会遇见一个什么人 陪我过没有了她的人生 成家立业之类的等等 她做了她觉得对的选择 我只好祝福她真的对了 爱不到我最想要爱的人 谁还能要我怎样呢 我爱的人 不是我的爱人 她心里每一寸 都属于另一个人 她真幸福 幸福得真残忍 让我又爱又恨 她的爱怎么那么深 我的爱人 她已有了爱人 从他们的眼神 说明了我不可能 每当听见 她或他说(我们) 就像听见爱情 永恒的嘲笑声  　    坐在你的身边是种满足的体验 看你看的画面 过你过的时间 天也晴了 花也开了 微风也沉醉 虽然你不说话 却也早已万语千言 分分秒秒显得清澈又珍贵 只有你才能给我这种感觉 不管心多疲倦 梦想还有多远 有你陪伴一切都无所谓 我要陪你擦拭每个昨天 相片 日记 书签 有暖意慢慢浮现 我要用默默的体贴 让你睁开双眼 看见昨夜梦想都实现 我也愿意帮你打扫房间 把身体好好锻 好让你觉得安全 让你记得我的优点 无论任何时间 对我非常想念 非常想念 我也愿意帮你打扫房间 把牌技好好演练 陪你母亲打八圈 为你写下盈泪诗篇 感觉就像触电 才会对我想念 非常想念 我也帮你打扫房间 帮你的爸爸戒菸 帮你兄弟姐妹买早点 让你时刻觉得很炫 生活过得很休闲 对我非常想念 非常想念
