       Hey crazy ninos!   I've decided to start one of these bloggy things. God has been teaching me suh much lately...tis a shame not to write it down somewhere. So alas, I turn to the wonderful world of internet. So hopefully I can keep up and remember to write the things in here. I guess we will see how it goes, eh? (that was for all of you Canadians out there....)  Peace.

       Weekend Stuffeseses   My modem died so o I haven't been able to type anything on here over the weekend. Darn storms. Well, this weekend was pretty cool. I went to the Riverbats game with a group from Southeast Christian Church. It was the second game I've ever even been to ever. The other one was the Anaheim Angels...well unless you count little league, then I've been to three games total. Anywho, the game got kinda interesting in the last inning and then we lost.   I walked around the stadium alot. It was kinda cool seeing all of the different people. I prayed for alot of them as I walked past. God's really placed that on my heart lately....praying for random people....cuz with God it's never random. All of the people that I have any kind of interaction with whatsoever whether it's as a really good friend or the cashier who always checks me out at the store or the waitress at the restaurant or a person I pass on the street and never say a word to, God has placed them all in my life and in my path for a reason. That's so crazy cool to think about!!! It makes you realize how interactive God is in our lives, whether we realize it or not. It definitely makes me think more about my responsibility as a Christian to pray for these people and, if so led, to start a conversation and possibly some kind of relationship with them. I pray that God would place these people in my path and give me wisdom and courage to take advantage of the opportunities He's given me.  Sunday, I went to church. Woohoo. Kyle Idleman talked about servanthood and how we are called to serve not to be served. And our servanthood is not limited to people who are "servable" (aka: nice, appreciative, respectable, yadda da yadda). We are also called to serve those who annoy us, are rude and unappreciative. And even if we know that they are going to hurt us in the future, it doesn't matter. This is such a big thing for me. I've been praying that God would truly help me to understand forgiveness as He sees it. I kinda hold to a kind of "forgiveness" that says "ok, i will try hard to get along with you despite the fact you've hurt me or ticked me off." It's such bullcrap on my part. I've got to come to the point of realization that I will be hurt and I will be stepped on and even in those times I've got to step out and serve those people knowing that it will happen again but not allowing that to hinder my service or my thoughts about that person....anywho, it was just a whole lot about what I've been studying in Jeremiah....actually, I think I might just go ahead and describe in another post my current spiritual developments cuz they are suh exciting.   The Vine was really cool. Worship was awesome despite the fact that I thought the floor was going to cave in....but it didn't :O)

       Distractions   The need to love. It is a strong and powerful force.  Not just to be loved but to love - to experience the fulfillment.  Relationships falter all around. It's hard to have hope.  Yet the need remains. Our very nature yearns for these things. Yet when I search for the object of my love, I am left wanting.  I wonder how people find each other, where it begins.  Still, the need consumes me.  I pray.  I hear others speak of their need - how it consumes their life.  I pray.  It consumes mine too.  I pray.  The balance between the heavely and earthly is oftern twisted for the earthly I can see.  But the heavenly surrounds me, lives within me. It penetrates my soul, my being.  Yet somehow I'm blinded to it's presence.  I trudge on down the sidewalk - the trees, the car, the people.  My thoughts shift. How can I devote my heart - fully devote - to this God.  A parking meter, a mailbox, a crosswalk.  The God of the universe, the mighty creator.  The gas station, a pothole, the noise.  He calls my name, but I hardly hear.  The traffic, the planes, the songs in my head.  Dear God, scream louder.  **This was written on 10-2-03 as I deal with the vice of allowing the distractions in my life to cloud my view of Jesus.**

       Surreal   I find no comfort in my surroundings. The trees, The sky, Even the very air I breathe -  It all seems so surreal,  As if they were masks created to convince my mind That knowledge is found through sight, That love is found through giving. I yearn to see beyond what is here, Not with my eyes Rather with my very being. There is something more. Something so unexplainable and uncomprehendable. Something that most people shall never see. Nor will they miss not seeing it, For they view the world only with their eyes. To open oneself up to the true source of vision is far too terrifying. Not because of what is seen, but rather for us to truly see,  We must become transparent, Totally exposing ourselves to this harsh world. Yet even more terrifying, we must view ourselves as we truly are. So, we convince ourselves that happiness is found solely  In our state of blindness. A lie that swallows our desire to see.   **This was written on 8-5-99 when I was struggling through depression and God's role in it all. It is so awesome to see what God has brought me out of!! Still I find these words an insightful reminder of how deceptive our world can truly be and even moreso, how deceptive we are with ourselves.**

       The Point Between   Confusion steeps my soul with words much too difficult to say.  And I sit here. Here in complacency, Here in denial, Here is self absorption. I don't want to talk about it. Not because I don't want to deal with it but because I don't know how. How to express the thoughts I'm thinking.  How to make sense of the things I'm feeling.  It all seems so circular.  I don't even want to think about it  Because I keep ending up at the same points over and over again. The bottom line is that it doesn't make sense. Is it me or is it them? Now I don't even know.  And if it is me, then how can I truly know anything? At all? I can't. I don't. So I sit here. Here in confusion.  Here in hopelessness. Only is doesn't really feel like hopelessness anymore. It is beyond that. My brain is foggy. I want to give up. But for what? A life of ignorance? Can I ever truly be happy with these thoughts in the back of my mind, knowing that I would be living a lie? So now, the problem is ever before me. While the solution evades the entire plateau of reason. I'm tired of talking about what I want.  It doesn't make a difference anymore. I just don't even want to think about it My body is exhausted from the constant searching.  It must end. There must be an answer. But where? Not in the frail logic of man. Not in the ever-changing emotions of man. Not in the hypocritical actions of man. Not in man at all. It must be elsewhere.  In a place we continually try to overlook.  Our stupidity drives us in the opposite direction And our pride keeps us there. Now it is no longer just about me. No, now it is about the whole. Humankind. We continue to look the other way as salvation stares us in the face. But we can't give up what little we cling to. Somewhere along the way,  We were misled into believeing that this world is what our existence is all about. Pointless. Ignorant. We have tried to remove the true source of all that is. Thinking that we are the inventors, The discovers, The creators. Can we invent something that is already made? Can we discover what is already known? Can we create what has always been? We must relinquish this false power we believe we possess. For this is not the purpose. But still I sit here. Here as the whole. Here convicted of all that has come between. Here, I sit.  **This was written 2-26-00 during a time when I was struggling through some very tough doctrine and looking at it all in light of how we as Christians, as people, live these things out.**

        The Cost of Love    The world crumbles around me, As the darkness rushes in. All the words I spoke in vain Tear and rip apart my skin. Exposing me to what is real Exposing me to truth. I lay here stripped and naked Looking everywhere but You.  This truth it hurts my wearied heart, It makes me cry aloud. I try to quiet my aching pains As I whisper through the crowd. I smile and laugh and pass You by As if the world is full of glee But every breath I take Brings me closer here - to me.  The darkness - it cannot prevail. Trembling I turn to face my fears. I feel some strength within me. I fight back the showers of tears. You have a plan and this I know A plan to bring me life, A plan to watch my darkest hours To call forth your wife.  I turn to You with tear-stained checks How bright Your light does shine. I realize now, that the darkness I saw Was only because I was blind. By choice I went and shut my eyes Darkness filled my vision alone But when I turned and faced your glory, Radiance flowed from Your throne.  I thank You God that You are King And that You are filled with love. For in my own power I can never attain Your blessings from above. But you have bought redemption You have sacrificed To live a life in love with me Paid at the highest price.

       Freed to Dance   The space between dreams and reality is an ever-moving line. It dances. It spins. It twists and glides. Sometimes my heart is filled with thrill and awe. Sometimes - with aching and anguish. It all depends on how this space aligns itself. The moment of truth. This dance makes it difficult to know with certainty Which way to choose, Which path to walk, Which heart to trust, Which soul to touch. For one side can not make decisions based on the other. They each demand my all, Yet I yearn for the balance. I am pulled and torn and led away- Sometimes for good, Sometimes for bad. I ponder on God's design- His decision to place man in a real world But to give him a mind that can dream up another. Sometimes those dreams rip us apart. Other times they pull us together. So I will join the dance- Performed to the song of God's providence, Led by the hand of God's grace. Sometimes I might fall. Sometimes I might soar. But this space between the dreams and the real, Truly make life worth living for.

       Untitled   Nothing is ever quite what it seems, As uncertainty spins its web, Clouding the hopes I treasured. I try to resist the trap, But I am taken in Through my desire to live, to love. This isn't how it's supposed to be. This isn't what you're supposed to say. I have rehearsed it over and over again On the stage of my mind. So follow the script And we will be alright. But you don't, so we aren't. What am I left with? Disappointment and depression. Can't we try it my way, Just this once?

       Ode to a Night of Little Sleep   My head is foggy as exhaustion overcomes. Faint memories of hostilities expressed fill my mind. What I have feared my whole life is coming to fruition. The uncontrollable release of emotions leave me volatile and unpredictable. I yearn for balance. I desire control. These things evade my grasp.

       Words Float Away   I try to conjure the words to express what I feel. But I can not fabricate them within the confusion of my thoughts. I only get brief glimpses of sanity as my thoughts fly by too fast for me to grasp. The world goes on as if all is well. The sun still rises. The sun still sets. The darkness still consumes the night. And I am left alone to wonder when peace will make it's presence known. The mundane tasks of everyday life bring no passion to my heart. I lack direction. I lack desire. I'm tired of scooting through life doing just enough to get by. I am not able to muster enough strength to take hold of my dreams. I have been beat down by the world. My arms, once strong, are no longer able to lift me from my burdens. My legs, once muscular, are no longer able to carry me away from the pain. So, I sit powerless as the world overtakes me.

       Another Day   Confusion weaves a web around my thoughts. I grasp blindly for something to cling to...some sort of stability. I am met with nothing but empty spaces. As fear consumes me, I transform into an anxious creature, knowing nothing but the fight for survival. Hostilities scream within my head, warring with harmony for my attention. They win. They always win. I fight for control. But I lose. I always lose. As I torment myself, a victim of my own thoughts, I wonder if I will ever know peace. My only choice is distraction. It's a struggle but at least it provides momentary hiatus from the war within. But all too quickly it's over as I'm left to face the harsh reality. Religion, independence, career, confidence, school, spirituality, relationships, family, drama, friends, hobbies, passions, words, prayers, self discipline, understanding, edification, partying, hurts, depression, wounds, dissapointment...my world crumbles around me. Balance is non-existent. My strength wears thin. I can not do it anymore.

        Group Therapy    Hostilities continue to war with my sanity. It sucks. It's never been safe for me to express my emotions. So I've held on to them, internalized them. Now I'm screwed. I'm tired of all the Christian shit about denying yourself, sacrificing yourself, anger is bad, what would Jesus do....God gave us our emotions so I'm sure he intended for us to use them. Not to suppress them in the name of piety. I'm so tired of my life of deceit. Now I'm ticked and I don't care who knows it.

       Fun   Mind-numbing skills increase as I seek to fill my head with anything but reality. I'm getting better at this task. A weekend of wild fun in Nashville made it easier to cope. My reaction of absolute bliss versus my friend's hangover pains makes me wonder. But I don't want to think too hard right now. It was fun and that's all that matters. Now I trudge through the task of milling through my entire life of torment as I sort out what went wrong and where. All this to the tune of a cursing elderly woman who is darn friggin good at dragging things out of people. All this in front of an audience struggling through the same shit. I pray that peace will come.

       Sleepy   I feel exhausted...emotionally, mentally, physcially. It's amazing how life can affect you. I don't know if this is natural or medicine induced or a combination of both. But I am worn out. Unfortunately, I can't sleep. There is no time.

       Overwhelmed.    I don't know what other word to describe how I feel. There seems to be so much that needs work. So much for me to do. I'm stuck. I want it all to just go away. I'm tired of having to think about these things. Having to ponder these things. I understand my problem but I still don't know what the hell to do about it. I continue to distract myself. Sometimes I'm successful. Sometimes I'm not. In the mean time, I'm not about to commit to anything with anybody. My brain is shot. I can't even think straight. There doesn't seem to be a hope through this. Everyone says there is but I just can't even fathom the concept. I'm tired of it all. My obessive thoughts will ever plague me. I guess I should accept the fact that my illness will ever be before me. I can't fix it. Others can't fix it. I don't think it can be fixed. I'm tired of the hurt and the pain and all the shit I've been put through. I don't even care anymore.

        Ten Broeck    Yesterday was my last day for group therapy. I so came to love that place. Hours a day in the midst of honest communication. It was something that I was missing my whole life. It developed into an environment that was safe, calm, and loving with Mary as our surrogate mother cheering us on and ripping us new ones - whatever was appropriate. I miss it. I miss being able to share my thoughts and feelings with people actually listening and me receiving honest feedback. I miss listening to other people and understanding the different fixes we use to compensate for our lost self worth. I miss being able to say shit and hell without being judged. I miss being about to talk about sex in a realistic way without being condemned. I miss being able to talk about my somewhat psychotic thoughts with people who are honest enough with their own shit to admit they've been in similar situations. It's amazing. We all had the same problem, just different symptoms. I need to take what I've learned in this setting and transfer it to my reality. But I'm not quite sure how that will play out.   There are many things I have learned about myself. I know more about my problem and where it stemmed from. I'm learning to not be so critical of myself. It is so amazing how our childhood affects every aspect of our adulthood. Those messages that get stuck in our mind play throughout our lives. Sometimes they are good messages and that's awesome. But sometimes they are lies and that's when we have to step back and separate ourselves from them. I'm tired of the deceit. I'm tired of trying to live up to other people's expectations. I'm tired of wanting people to view me as some super Christian. I'm confused about how my spirituality plays into all of this mess. But I know I've been dished out some fucked up religious views that kept me in a life of shame and guilt.   Well, I guess I will take it one day at a time. Today, I'm realizing that my crazy obsessions that seem to control me are actually my attempt to create chaos in my life because it's my comfort zone. It's what I'm used to. Throughout my life, there has been much legitimate chaos. I became so used to it that when it wasn't present, I was uncomfortable. So I start to obsess over past things to fill that void. I need to continue to realize when I'm doing this and kick it in the ass. Self worth is another HUGE issue. I basically have none. I need to restructure my thinking away from false religious precepts that have held me in bondage and toward the truth. Fuck lies.

       Baptists...Those Dirty Dogs   Ok, so maybe it's the baptists that I hate. After years of growing up under the legalistic dogma that did nothing for me but enhance a sense of shame, I'm realizing that maybe belief systems aren't absolutes, like I had been led to believe. Years of hiding my faults and elevating myself above others as a disguise is coming to an end. And I'm damn glad it is. This screwed up behavior wasn't a conscious effort on my part. It was all that I had known. When things get messed up, you hide it. When you make a mistake, you hide it. When your family embarasses you, you hide it. You don't talk about it. Don't even acknowledge it. This is NOT healthy.   Then you throw in the concept of religion and the stresses accompanying a world view that life demands perfection and so does Jesus. You have people who give you pre-fab answers to life's crappy events and stare at you like you're nuts for not tapping into "God's peace." I spent almost my entire life struggling with depression. Whenever I would try to talk to people about it, I would get fucked up answers like "Whatever is worthy, noble, blah blah blah...think on those things", "You may be unhappy with the circumstances but if you ask God, He will give you joy even in the  midst of it all" and "What would our passive Jesus do...turn the other cheek and move on considering it an honor to suffer for Christ." Ok, so then I pray my whole life and where is this peace....no where. I am angry and hostile on the inside but Jesus doesn't like angry people....so Jesus must not like me then. But what if I just hide the anger and suppress it...maybe He won't notice. Again, these aren't things that I consciously thought about but perspectives I had developed based on the attitudes of those around me.   I don't even want to start on the attitudes of the Baptists as a whole. My time at Seminary was by far some of the worst years of my life dealing with people. As a whole, the Seminary community cared more about proving a theological point to elevate themselves above others than they did about other people. It's so ironic because it should be the one place with the most caring people but it isn't. They sit around and gossip in the name of "prayer requests", they spread rumors and lies with no regard to the people they are hurting, they are dishonest with the things they struggle with leading them to a lifestyle of hidden sin stuck in a perpetual cycle, they get more upset over petty things like language and immodest clothing than they do about the reason they are even at Seminary....because people are GOING TO HELL. My years spent there were one big lie. It was enveloped in deception. They twist God's word to make themselves look better. This is not what I see as the church when I read the Bible.   Then there's my church that I grew up in...a power hungry pastor elevated above questioning and bent on intimidating those he comes in contact with. A church that says shit to you when you wear jeans to church because everyone knows that Jesus hates those disrespectful jeans. So we must all dress up and act like everything is wonderful so other people at church will think we are super Christians, all the while we are falling apart on the inside. Our families are eroding...dads are fucking younger women, kids are doing drugs, moms are popping pills...then we dress up in our Sunday best and act like everything is wonderful. It's bullshit.   I hate the deception and I hate the lies. I've done it for so long but I'm finished. No more. I'm not going to live my life to make other people view me a certain way. I'm going to be myself. If people like me, then they like me. If they don't, oh fuckin' well because I'm not going to bend over and kiss my ass for every person who won't accept responsibility for their own shit.   I don't know how all of this will play out but I know that things are definitely changing and I kinda like it. I have the right to live a life of freedom and not hold myself under the burdens of this shitty world. So, that's what I'm going to do.

       ...                    All or Nothing              Black or White              Rigid or Open            Passive or Aggressive  This is what codependents flip between. It's one extreme or the other. Either side is unhealthy. You are to desire a balance between the two. But now, in my codependency, I have journeyed from the far left to the far right. I don't want to be screwed over again. I don't. And now I'm going to make sure that it doesn't. The problem is...I'm turning into a real bitch. To be honest, it feels good. But unhealthy none the less. I guess it's a process. I wish I knew how to find a balance...until then...I feel kinda bad for those who tick me off. I'm sure sooner than later I will feel remorseful for those I offend. Until then, I'm going to have fun with my new found freedom of speaking my mind.

       beachchick     After a week in Myrtle Beach, I am quite dissappointed to wake up and not have a beach to run and play at in the mornings. The responsibilities of "real life" smack me in the face. Vacation was so much fun. I am so glad I got to spend time with my fam (Mom, Lou, my sister Cindy, her bebe daddy Chris, my nephew Caleb, my step-nephew Tyler, my step-niece Taylor, my step-sister Amy, her husband Mike and my step nephew Alan) and also with Rachel. I was so excited to have a friend on my family vacation. It made the night time fun. It's amazing some of the shit we got ourselves into....all in good fun of course. It's so cool to go and meet new people and get to know them as well.     The first day we were there, we went parasailing. It was way fun. They make you sign your life over and keep saying it's for "thrill seekers" but honestly it wasn't freaky at all. It was very relaxing. The banana boat ride out there was way more thrilling. Also the hot guys who operated the boat thing were more exciting. But I'm definitely glad I did it. It was very very relaxing.     The waves in Myrtle Beach are awesome!! Not as big as Cali but Cali waves are scary. Also, east coast water is warmer and easier to swim in. One night after it stormed. We went and fought the crazy waves for hours. It was sooooo friggin fun. We kept getting yelled at by the lifeguards because we were too far out!!! So much fun....for reals!!    We went out to eat at a seafood buffet place one night....actually it was a friggin Chinese restaurant that had a bunch of seafood. I felt ripped off but that's ok because we got all you can eat crab legs for $15. Rachel ate over 5 lbs of friggin crab legs....yeah, she likes food. We also went outlet shopping.....which seems to be my favorite past time lately. I got lots of fun stuff. There were a bunch of little shops along Ocean Blvd too. I got a cute little shirt for Caleb that said "If you think I'm cute then you should see my aunt". I had to buy it!!! I also got the cutest Corona outfit. I don't know why I'm so obsessed with Corona wear....probably because I'm pretty obsessed with Coronas....but you know....anywho, I got a cute little pink tank top with the Corona logo and a cute little white mini skirt thing with Corona written on the butt in pink.     Also, at one of the first stores we went to, I met this little asian guy, probably in his 30's. He worked there. We started talking and he mentioned competing in Aikido tournaments in Japan and I was like sweet. Cuz you really don't meet a lot of people who even know what Aikido is. So we talked for a bit. I don't know if he was hitting on me or what. It was weird. He was like maybe I can come to KY and teach you Aikido. He gave me his number and everything. I'm thinking um....ok. I don't quite trust him though because when I mentioned the name of the guy who started Aikido, Morhehei Ueshiba, he didn't know what I was talking about. And that's just weird. Oh well.It was weird. But cool to talk to a new person none the less.     The clubs in Myrtle Beach are  pretty fun. The first night we went out, we went to the House of Blues. They have a cute little deck bar area with a live band. We had a couple of drinks and were about to leave when the bartender came over and said this hot guy, Josh, wanted to buy us some drinks so...of course we didn't want to hurt his feelings. We ended up hanging out with him and his family and neighbors, who were all there on vacation, all night long. They were kinda wealthy. They bought us lots of drinks and we all danced (with all of them) and had fun. Seriously, they were all crazy!!! The whole family!!! They were staying in our same hotel so we all went back to their room and chilled. They were very cool people.  Plus Josh was hot....did I mention that???    The next night we decided to stay in and chill. We went all bummed out to the hotel bar and ended up having the most lame time of my life!! The woman who worked there was so annoying and harassed this guy for over 20 minutes about bringing alcohol into the bar. Finally I was like...WE MUST LEAVE NOW BEFORE MY BRAIN EXPLODES. She just wouldn't shut up about it.     So we got dressed up and went out to the Spanish Galleon which was kinda a lame club. We were bored out of our minds there too until we met Sean (Shawn?)....the coolest accountant in North Carolina. He was bored too so we started playing bar/club games to amuse ourselves. These consisted of dancing like retards in the cage (and amazing enough we fit in because most people there could NOT dance) and then picking out really ugly people or bad dancing people for each of us to go dance with. I made Rachel dance with this redneck with a mullett. Sean picked this bald funny looking guy in a 007 jersey for me to dance with. Unfortunately there weren't many busted girls for Sean to dance with so he got off easy. After that I spent the rest of the night dancing with Sean. He cracked me up to no end!! I wish he lived in Louisville because he is so the kind of guy that I go for....laid back and amazing sense of humor. I so regret not getting his contact info. Maybe I can find him with my stalker skills....who knows. Overall, it was a fun night with very little drinking. Probably the most fun I had.     The next night we drove down to the Freaky Tiki. This club is crazy. I later found out it's been on Wild on E and MTV. Fun times for us. We actually had gone to Mother Fletcher's first but it was lame. This older guy there bought us some drinks and then went with us to Freaky Tiki and hooked us up there as well. He was really nice and not creepy. Just said he wanted us to have a good time our last night there. Plus I think he liked walking around with "hot chicks" (ha). Anywho....this place is nutso...it has beds with tables and stuff, flames all over the walls, tv's all over the walls. They even have a "foam room" where you can dance in bubbles....really weird. Rachel went to take a picture and slipped on the steps and busted her ass. She has the biggest bruise now. It so sucks for her. We had to leave soon after that and on the way out this cute foreign guy started hitting me so I talked to him for a bit. Oh....I almost forgot....the boxer short contest!!! Fun times for the ladies.     That was the end of our fun. So sad. I am seriously sad. I wanna go back.  Ok, I'm done.

       Reconciliation     Confusion still clouds my mind. Changes have been made. All or nothing has been epitomized. Things that used to mean everything to me now mean very little. I'm just tired. I feel as though I've spent my whole life trying to live righteously, putting others first and truly seeking a higher power. And now I'm just bitter. I've been run over, taken advantage of and treated like shit. I figured if this is how it's going to be, if my efforts are so in vain, then I'm going to live my life and have fun. Either way I'm screwed so I might as well enjoy it more.     It's just the inconsistancies in life that boogle my mind. For example, why is it that the "good little christian" boys treat me like shit. They are disrespectful and twisted. And these are the people that are supposed to be good and encouraging. BUT...the drunk random guys from the clubs, they are quite respectful. When I say no, they say ok. Now what is up with this shit?!?!?!? It doesn't make any sense.     I feel like things are out of control. I know I'm being used but I'm using other people as well. So does it matter?? I don't feel bad. I don't feel guilty. I do feel somewhat uneasy if I think really hard about it. But I'm not sure if that is guilt from my actions or from my legalistic past that would tell me to never even speak with people who lived their lives in such a way. It's fucked up. So I'm just going with the flow, trying to survive. I am having more fun which is cool. I feel more free.     I'm having a hard time reconciling these things in my head. Beliefs, actions, values, virtues.....how do they all interact???
