      The dream has ended, and it turned out to be another nightmare.&nbsp; I went out on that limb yet again, and not only did it snap, it shattered.&nbsp; I'm sure that at some point I may take that chance again, but I do not believe it will be very soon.&nbsp; My heart has shattered into a million pieces, and only time will help to heal it.&nbsp;   I do not believe that it is not that he didn't love me, but he has a terrible disease that prevents him from living his life.&nbsp; He cannot love anyone until he learns to love himself.&nbsp; It is sad, because he is one of the sweetest, kindest, most loving people I have ever met.&nbsp; I pray for him to get better and be free from the demons that haunt him.&nbsp; I wish I could help, but the only help I can give him is to stay away.  God, please help me have the strength I need to make it through this trial.

        Life is a dream....    After nearly 38 years on this earth, I have finally found my true love.  He is the yang to my yin, my soul mate as it were.  He means more to me than I ever imagined was possible.  I do believe life is a dream.  Unfortunately, up until now, mine had been more like a nightmare.  When that happens, you are afraid to accept the good things for what they are.  You keep waiting for the "other shoe to drop" - the bad to resurface.  Sometimes, good is just good - there is no bad waiting around the corner.  I hope and pray that this is the case here.  The last six weeks have been some of the happiest in my life.  I feel that my will to live has been strengthened ten-fold just by having him near.  He is the man I want to grow old with, take care of, be taken care by....the one great love that lasts a lifetime.  I thank God every day for bringing him into my life and allowing me to recognize my other half.  Life is a dream.....and love is the pillow.

        Cautious optomism returns with his willingness to fight this disease.  The past several days have been filled with hopes and prayers that he makes it through this unscaythed.....and then, perhaps, we can continue to build on this once in a lifetime relationship.  My heart sings when he is near - I love him so.  Nothing would make me happier than to see him recover from this.  Even if we do not continue, I wish him all the health and happiness one life can have - he deserves it!          Thank you, God, for helping him and me get through this terrible time - I know neither of us could do it without you.  I pray that we both continue on this path to healing and recovery.
