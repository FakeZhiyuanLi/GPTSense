       The April Diamond   the winged bird, the king who wished a poetry  "the remembering of the diamond rings" oh am i moved, indeed and yet i ennoble now "the beloved dove is a beauty and so lovely" the windy-looking diamond binds the one of  the kindest minds to unite the findings oh of the careful clue of a rarefied gem  that bears the hot flares of rays - so barely my oldest feeling of yin yang that bore  two sides of a bold light and a cold night;  oh my charming april! i told you, my april!  the diamond is like being the gold!    @William-Kalani Chevy Kekua, April 2004

       Who is my god or goddess?   The GOD can be the universal superior or is it a female GOD that rules the solar system and unspeakable mystery of the hidden systems across the galaxies.  The God can be the world supervior or is it a Goddess that rules the planet of earth that celebrates the trinity of life air, water, and land.  The goddess can be the figure of paganism or is it really a male god that rules the spiritual, mystical, magical realm of each individuals may it be the goddess of ocean or the god of shark.  My GOD is a ghost of my past life memories My God is an unknown figure of my faith My goddess is the GODDESS of Fire, Pele who rules my everyday spiritual needs and wants.  May your chosen one become a map Guide you to the destiny of your purest soul.   ~kekua april 2004

       The Morning Star   Sunrise is bursting with sunlight and full of joys, Singing all morning with grace and care, So, hence the beauty of nature gives me rejoices, And the forest of light bleeds raw and rare  Sunrise penetrates into your skin with warmness, Squirming yourself to death and with simpers, Shoulder for the morning star to burst with coolness, And the blue sky brightens up so pure and simple  Sunrise is forever shining on flowers fruitifully, Striving to emit the plethora of pollens with its bold, Soak the wintriness and to doctor them beautifully, And the meadow of flower shimmers radiant and gold  Sunrise embraces the beauty of life and arts, Siphoning in the light to magnify all dream parts, Sprinkle the stardust on the life's tender hearts, And it's time to hail our dearest morning star!   ~kekua  march 2004

       Bright Yellow Flower   bright yellow flower has thirst for sunshine, giving me a new contentment, but rain came in my way, smothering me in sorrow...  oh flower can be strong to stand, but a pain of being splattered, with tears from the heaven, and fighting to spread my petals...  bright yellow flower represent my feelings, trying to absorb sunshine and to burst, but clouds block the beauty of seeding, and a darkness envelopes my thirst...  oh flower tries to sit still and bloom, but wind blew me away and tumbles, my dear pollens are flying everywhere, mingling with cold droplets...  bright yellow flower is too tired to go on, searching for ways to stretch my petals, but will always forever be trapped with rain, rain, and rain....   ~kekua  april 2003

Show  me about who you are, and  how  beautiful you are, I shall  lower  my head down and  bow , oh my friends and I encourage you continue to  grow  and  know  yourself by loving yourself so dearly  slow .   Shoot for the evening  star  and  unbar  yourself out and hop in a hot  car  to go so  far  away - hey don't you  mar  yourself because I could not  bear  the  scar , so I preserve of our friendship in a  jar .   You are not very  cold , you are never that  old , you are  bold , you and i  molded  our friendship very well, you  told  me that you love yourself first, you  hold  a place in my heart and you are a  gold .   ~Kekua May 2004

       Rainbow   The prickly sharpened thorns Oh sweet smell of red roses Light reflects many new morns Morning orange hue proposes A new day and let the sun bloom Yellow lilies: sun has a class Of being sincere and broom The evil away from green grass I lie down and look up 'noon sky Royal blue calms me and I praise The pale purple clouds up high Above I and the humidity arise Rain shoots us the magicked arrows  And the birthing of rare rainbows  ~Kekua,  June 2004

       Gay Chinese Pride    I always get a Chinese good luck packet colored brightest red  Every year, the Chinese new year, and I like to eat tea bread  I like to dine at Chinese restaurant and order tofu with orange Oh tasty sauce; the Chinese dish, so mysteriously strange I recognize myself as part-Chinese, feeling the royalty of yellow It brings me balance and a peace of mind; as a Chinese fellow I want to own a Chinese jade bracelet - a beauty, so pearly green The joy of wearing jewerly and be a beautiful Chinese drag queen I also wish to obtain another priceless necklace of Chinese blue  Topaz and it accentuates the Chinese silk dress all in white hue I enjoy to eat the variety of vegetables such as the Chinese purple Cabbages and eggplants; the Chinese way to be a healthy person I love the Chinese culture for the spiceness of life and I shall bow  To you and proclaim that I am gay; the Chinese style of rainbow    ~Kekua,  June 2004
