      well, funny funny. me, ashley, lauryn, and daniel went to see meangirls... Well, when me, ashley, and lauryn were in the car on our way to pick up daniel, this commercial was on the radio and it was all "Have you seen Mean Girls? Well, if you haven't you should! Boys, do you know how many hot girls will be at the theatres watching it? Mean Girls is a movie you've got to see. You should go see it on a Friday night." When we heard that we were all "WTF?!" And then by the time we got to Regal, the movie had already started so we ended up seeing Shrek 2. When we got home, we found out that Shrek 2 was already playing at Chabot Cinema >.

      ... jeez! lauryn got all pissed off at me just cuz i went to her computer cuz there was an iMovie that was funny and i was gonna show it to dane. she was all rasing her voice to me bout leaving HER computer alone.   I'm goin to the movies tonight with Ashley, Daniel, and Lauryn. Well... maybe. The only one of the four of us that has already asked their parents is Lauryn. So, me, daniel, or ashley might not be able to go. CRAP. I was sposed to clean my room yesterday so when i asked my mom if i could go to the movies, she would be cool with it, but cynthia and her friend paulina (friend from canyon) came over, i got sidetracked and ended up not cleaning. now i have to clean my room today >.

      Yesterday me n jack sword fought and he got me pretty good in the thumb and i was all bleeding. then i told daniella somethin i shudnt and ashley got all pissed off at me, and so did jack cuz i was talking to his crush.  GOLLY GEE, my parents SURE ARE ANAL IN THE MORNING!! first, there was that annoying conversation with my dad in the car yesterday morning, and today my mom was actin like a bitch... well maybe she was having her period or someshit, but she was hella annoyin. first, she was getting on my brothers case about him being late all the time for school now that he has his own car. and he says that this was ONE occasion. then she gets all mad at him and tells him that hes not going to drive me to school in the morning even though i was dressed and ready and waiting. so i ask my mom if she could drive me to school early cuz i was already ready. she replied by saying "lemme take a little nap first and then get ready, cuz why should i wake up early just to drive you to school when you're not even late yet. so i get pissed off and walk to school without telling ne one. when i was walking to school, about 2 blocks from the school, i hear her car driving  up, and she stops. then she opens the door for me to get in. she drives me to school and drops me off without saying ne thin... she looked pretty moody. ahh well, we'll see how things go tonight.

      fukkk... my dad drove me to school today. TODAY OF ALL DAYS!! He was looking at the flowers and eyeing me all funny. Then he asked "what was the occasioon?" and i told him that there was no occasion. THEN he started going off about how all he saw now-a-days was B's and no A's although he only saw ONE B that was in hoovers that i get every quarter. He started talking about my studies and how i needed to study more during the weekends. how i needed to work more around the house and was the car and.. stuff. he then asked again of what the occasion was for me bringing the flowers to school. when i told him AGAIN that there wasn't an occasion he started talking about how him and mom are already having difficulties economically and that i shudnt just buy flowers for no reason for a girl and then he said that i was a spoiled brat and that was rotten. U_U

      Hey, in Eberly's class again in the maclab... doing nothing... the only thing i can think of to say is that i lost my wallet wiht 24 bucks in it. I'm gonnn a have to search the ENITIRE house for it cuz i need the money to buy ashton the flowers i promised her ;]. lol... i wish i cud use that money for a hat, but a deals a deal. Daniel is right next to me and lauryn is asking him "whats wrong?" like usual. Wanna go see Mean girls... GOD I NEED A HAT. Right now, growing out my hair seems like a bad idea cuz my hair always sticks up and its all uneven and fluffy. But, in a few months from now, my hair will be... AWESOME. DUN DUN DUN! well... tah tah for now. BB.
