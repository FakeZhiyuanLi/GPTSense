      this is a pretty cool picture of dave and whit, well one of the only pictures i have, so it'll just have to do.  i can't forget to give props to the lil cutie herself, emma!    dave and whit are engaged to get married next year on may 21st.  they met at camp lakeview and have been inseparable ever since.  well other then that one year that whit was in new york going to school at keuka but then she moved here to good ol' indiana to be closer to her dave.  dave is anxiously waiting to get down to another summer of maintenance work at camp lakeview.  he getting ready to graduate this saturday the 15th from purdue university.  he majored in MET and was one of the best students in his class!  he is hoping that after this summer he'll be able to obtain a full time position at lakeview in their maintenance department.  which he'll hopefully be building an extension of camp.  keeping me fingers crossed.  whitney is also waiting to get down to camp this summer to work in the program staff.  she's been a camper or worker at lakeview for a long time i am sure she's also very excited about camp starting.  she has one more semester of classes and then a semester of student teaching before she graduates in may of 2005.  she'll know better where she'll be going after that when dave finds out his plans after this summer.  but she has a long time before she needs to start worrying about that.  i think that i'll be the only person in the vandercar clan that will be able to say that i have lived with both of them.  i've lived with dave the last two years and then i'll be living with whit next semester.  so that'll be a pretty interesting experience but i am excited about it.  all i can say is that dave and whit are two of the coolest people i know.  they are a great couple and i wish them many years of happiness!  here's you dave and whit!!!

      this weekend went a lot faster then i thought it would.  it was great to see josh and to hear some of the stories of his adventure to africa, but at the same time it was hard to see him for so short of a visit and have to say bye again.  i know he is making a difference it is great to know that he made it back safe and sound!  i spent the rest of the weekend in fort wayne at my parents house, i emphasize my parents house.  i packed up the rest of my stuff and packed shel's car as much as i could leaving the rest in my closet.  as i was walking out i took a picture of the most of my room that i could and realized that my room had never been that empty.  for the first time i realized that that place was no longer my home.  i have a lot of great memories there that i hope to cherish always, but i realize that times change and i am excited about what the future has in store.  i am waiting here at the vandercar house for shel to get off work so we can go back down to lafayette and unload the mess of stuff that i have in her car.  then i play the waiting game until dave has a change to get the rest of his stuff packed and moved out of the house so i can start to rearrange and decorate the house this summer.  i am pretty excited to have more then a room to put my stuff in and that will be a pretty interesting thing.  how and what do i want to do with the house!

      this has been a rather interesting week for me.  i've gone from one side of an emotion to the complete other side of that same emotion.  i had a chance to go back to camp lutherhaven this summer for a third summer as a counselor, but i ultimately declined going because i was afraid that when i came back from the summer i would have a hard time finding a job.  now i am second guessing myself so much and don't know if i made the right decision at all.  i've spent my entire life listening to people tell me that God will provide.  that we should spend our lives trying to do good and try to tell and show as many people as we can about God.  now when i have another chance to spend a summer doing just that i have the advice that i should watch out for myself and that i should be concerned about providing for myself.  at what point does that change, at what point do we stop putting our faith that God can and will provide for those who do service for him?  how and when do we actually differentiate between them?  these are some of the things that have been floating through my mind this week as i really try to become at peace with my decision to not go away to camp again.  i see so many people around me getting to go away this summer to camp and other things that i can't help but become extremely jealous and envious of them.  no matter what people tell you, human nature still creeps in and you still wonder why other people get the opportunities and chances that you never did.  i've heard so many people tell me that that is just life.  it's easy to look past these things when you aren't the person who is sacrificing.  i know full well that life will go on and will keep moving, even if i'm not ready for it to.  but at the moment i am pretty down.  here are some staff picture from my summers there.  there is the on "official" pictures and then the "not so official" pictures.  but that's pretty much it.  but here's to the summer of 2004!  i hope that it's the best summer that lutherhaven and lakeview have had yet.

      Clay Walker A few questions  How in this world Can we put a man on the moon And still have a need For a place like Saint Jude’s And why is one man born In a place where all they know is war A guy like me, Has always been free  And how can two people Who built a loving home Try for years And never have a child of their own And somewhere out there tonight There is a baby no ones holding tight In need of love To me that don’t add up  Chorus: But I wasn’t there the day you filled up the ocean I didn’t get to see you hang the stars in the sky So I don’t mean to second guess you Or criticize what I don’t understand These are just a few question I have  Andy why did my cousin Have to die in that crash A good kid Only seventeen I still wonder ‘bout that It seems unfair to me Some get the chance to chase their dreams And some don’t What do I know  Chorus: But I wasn’t there the day you filled up the ocean I didn’t get to see you hang the stars in the sky So I don’t mean to second guess you Or criticize what I don’t understand These are just a few question I have  Why do I feel like You hear these prayers of mine When so many aught to be Ahead of me in line When you look down on me Can you see the good through all the bad These are just a few questions I had

         yes, yes i haven't had working headlights in my new car for a few days.  and no i didn't tape flashlights to the front of my car or anything else drastic like that.  but i did avoid driving at night, i know so daring.     well anyways today i found out that it was the switch that had burned out and was ohh a nice 224 dollars to fix.  but i guess it's better than always having to drive during the day, cause then i'd feel like one of those old west people on a wagon and that just wouldn't be cool.  not to mention holding a flashlight outside your window for a long drive wouldn't exactly be the coolest thing to do.     well i'm not sure what i'm doing tonight, but i might just go to lafayette for a lil while and pick up a few things, like my camera.  i know, i know, you are all bummed that i haven't been putting any new pictures on here or my fotolog.  well that'd be because i haven't taken any new pictures.  see you kinda have to take some to post some.  so hopefully some fun stuff will happen next week and i can start to put some pictures up again.     then i might just decided to run by my favorite lil guys house and take him out to his fav store.  i'm thinking that maggs is due for a trip to petsmart and could def use a nice big bag of treats to get him through this summer!  as for that i'm not really doing that much at all.     ohhhhh wait, i ordered a new cell phone today...wooohoooo i know.  i'll put the number in my profile or something like that when i finally get it.  it's not a flip phone, so i just wont be as cellular cool as i use to be, but it has an all blue display so i'm stepping up in the world.  so i really can't wait to get it!!!!

         i spent today hanging out with my friend michelle.  i haven't seen or talked to her for almost a year now and it was great to see her.  it's always a humbling experience to find out one of your best friends is engaged and there was no way for her to call you because she didn't have your number.  but she seems really happy and is getting ready to go to iowa.  how crazy is this!!!     we ended up going to best buy which for me is always an adventure.  i managed to go there yesterday and not spend any money but two days in a row, that's just asking me way too much.  so i started to look and to search and before i knew it i was convinced, and i do stress convinced that i just had to have a new computer game.  which let me tell you was mainly decided because of the movie i watched last night.  so if the game isn't any good i'll have to write to the people who made the movie troy and tell them that they owe me 20 dollars for being way to suggestive during there movie.     tonight i'm just hanging out and having a night to myself.  i forgot how much i use to enjoy just hanging out by myself from time to time.  it's a great feeling to enjoy myself again, and i can't believe that it took all this for me to find who i was again.  but i'm glad that God has centered me and made me aware of the things that i forgot to make important in my life.  but even through all this i can still say that certain things haven't changed.  like how i feel about a certain someone, God has all the answers.  but it's not my choice what happens from here, i've just got to put my faith in God that he already knows what he wants to happen in my life.       i think that friday morning is going to turn into the all eventful go out and put in app after app.  i have no idea exactly where i want to work but for the first time i know that i wont have to work full time and i will be able to pick and choose something that i really want to do and not worry about how many hours i'll be able to get there.  so hopefully come next week i'll have some major news to write on here...keeping my perverbial fingers crossed.       well i think this is enough until something really fun happens.  hope everyone is enjoying the beginning of your summer.

         and then there wasn't, at least that's the way it turned out for me.  i'd really suggest that you leave the whole making light out of darkness up to someone who is a little bit more experienced than we are.  but anyways i might as well try to explain this whole thing better before you think i was laying in bed and didn't want to turn on the light switch and thought that somehow i was endowed with the ability to produce light from my finger tips.  i know i like harry potter, but i really haven't gone to that extreme just yet!!!     when i first started to drive my new car...oh by the way...side note didn't even tell anyone.  i bought a new car, it's a teal blue 95 grand am.  i know, i know you're all saying that's not that great, but trust me if you'd seen what i'd been driving for the last two years, you'd be doing somersaults all over the place!     well anyways back to the story...the headlights decided the other day that they didn't want to work.  which is really odd because they did the night before.  i was thinking that maybe it was the fuse so i went to auto zone to see if they had that kind and they didn't.  so the next day i went to the pontiac dealership to see if i'd be able to buy one from them and of course they tell me to go somewhere else and i headed off to napa.  when i got there they didn't have one with the right spacing so he told me to go to radio shack.  are ya seeing a theme right about now???  and side note again, who goes to radio shack to buy a part for your car, yeah i was thinking it was a tad bit odd myself.  and of course they didn't have it.  which makes you think that the whole "shaq sized" commercials they have really are a bit misleading.  so he sends to me another electronics store called pembleton's, which i never even found.     phew, are you still with me???  i decide i'll check out another pontiac dealership and he sends me to the tom kelly place and finally woohoo i get the part that i needed.  i tell ya, in the moment i felt as though heaven had opened up and started to shine down on me.  if you've ever seen monty python, that lil circuit breaker was my holy grail for at least 30 seconds.  that is until i plug it and turn on the lights and get out of the car saying, and God said let there be light, and there was nothing.  i couldn't believe it, my whole morning had turned into a scavenger hunt and i didn't even fix the things.  so i am going to take it into a shop to have them tell me what's wrong with it.  i'm not sure exactly what the moral of this story is, but maybe it's...don't try to mimic God's one liners, they only work for him!!!  (just a word of warning...spell check really hates lower case writing.)

         i'm sure that most of the people that will read this will already know how much my life has changed in the past couple of days.  i still can't find the words to describe what i am feeling but what i can do it tell you that for the first time in a long time i am allowing myself to do the things that would make my life better.     i have decided to move back to Fort Wayne and to take classes full time at IPFW.  for those of you who aren't familiar with that college it's indiana-purdue university in fort wayne.  or as we students like to call it "I Pay For What."  i am going to start to pursue my secondary education degree in social studies and for the first time in a while i'm going to be able to concentrate on just being a student instead of all the other things i have worried about for the last two years.     i think that in the last 5 days i've talked to my friends more than i did for a long time.  i've realized how much of myself was falling away because i wasn't allowing myself to keep being who i was.  i was starting to turn into someone that everyone knows wasn't that happy.  i had left everything to come to a place that i hadn't planned anything out.  i'm not sure exactly why things have happened the way they do, but i am just putting my faith in God.  that no matter what i want or anyone else wants he has a plan for all things.  i know that in the end i will be happy through Christ, because he is the only way to find peace.     i want to tell you all that i love you so much and miss you so much.  all of God's love, blessings, and peace to you all!!!

         i got some exciting news today on my cell phone.  why do people always seem to call me when i'm in the shower?  i guess i have this super human power that enables myself to miss almost every call that i get.  but i was checking my messages and mike from lutherhaven called to ask if i wanted to work this next week at camp.  what an awesome oppertunity to get up there this summer.  i can't wait tell tomorrow night when i am on the friendly confines of lake muncie and enjoying the lake breeze.  well okay, it isn't exactly like what you get in chicago, but i can still have my fun.     so you'll have to wait a week or so for me to fill you in on all the cool things that are going to happen next week.  the theme night is hawaii, so i'll have to get a fun outfit or something like that.  =)  mike said that i'll either be in cabin 2 or cabin 3, which is pretty ironic.  those are the two cabins i had in my past summers.  so God must just be smiling down on me.  i can't help but hope i'm in each for different reasons.  but it'll still be a fun week all the same.  and guess what, i getta go swimming...wooohooooo.     laters n' Christ

         i know, i know, you all want my autograph now. just start a single file line and we'll get this done as soon as we can.  umm, only one picture per person and there aren't going to be any t-shirt signing's, i just think that is way tacky.     but anyways you're prolly wondering why i am a movie star now...so there is some mad flooding up here in fort wayne.  it is starting to get pretty crazy when little creeks  start to crest and flood streets.  josh, mary, karl, jessica and me went down to see ken and rachel.  when we got there we wished we had brought a boat cause their street was flooded.  we ended up parking a few streets down and walked across yards to get down to their house and when we got there they weren't there.  i mean come on, we trudge through swamp lands to see them and they aren't even there.  =)  but on our way back there was a news guy interviewing some lady and it got mary and jessica on the shot when we were walking by so they made it onto the news.  so by default since i was there and soooooo coulda gotten onto the shot to, i'm a movie star now.  yeah, i know it's just the 11 o'clock news, but come on.  =)~     other than that my weekend went off without to much of a hitch.  i went to lafayette and grabbed some more stuff and did a few other things that aren't exactly that exciting.  but all in all it was a good weekend.       but here is the biggest news of the hour for ELAN WILLIAMS.  i am officially no longer employed at knights inn.  yes sir, yes sir, i officially quit my job on saturday morning and am free from all the heart ache and worrying that i went through.  i have learned my lesson in staying at a job that you hated, but being in love can do some crazy things to your thinking.  i feel so much better that i don't have to put up with everything that is going on down there.  i know you are all like dude, elan, you don't have a cell phone now.  no worries, i am getting a new one tomorrow and the number is 260-418-5988...so give me a call anytime.  other than that i am just trying to stay dry...  laters n' Christ, elan

         we had an awesome week at camp!!!  it was international week so we had kids from all over the world at our camp this week.  i had two africans, a bermise, and a kid from tailand.  they all spoke pretty good english except for one of the kids from africa.  i think he's only been over in america for two years now and he didn't know how to say a lot of words.  but he talked a lot about africa and it was really awesome to hear how other countries live.  he was talking about how much the people there loved to swim in the ocean and the lakes that were around.  about how it was just soooo hot all the time that they were always swimming.  and every other question out of his mouth was, we go swimming now??  he was a really cute little guy.  it was just so great to see all these kids who didn't grow up knowing Christ at all ask sooo many insightful questions that i didn't have people who had known about Christ ask me in my past summer.  it was truly a moving experience and it humbles me a whole lot.    i am going to be able to work at camp again next summer and there is a possibility that i might be able to work the whole rest of the summer.  there is a guy ben who might have to go back to l.a. to help his mother.  he came to me today and asked if i'd be willing to fill in for him the rest of the summer.  i'll find out tonight what is going to happen after he talked to mike again, mike is in charge of the summer camp itself.    but if anyone wants to e-mail me...send it to...camp@lutherhaven.org, and then just address it with my name on it.  the address there is... 1596 S. 150 W. Albion IN 46701.  so feel free to write me anytime you want or send me as many e-mails as you'd want to also!!!  i love all of you soooo much and i'll try to get some camp pics up as soon as i can.  miss you all soooooooo much!!!!!
