      It's amazing, isn't it, that someone's life can end so suddenly, while everyone else is forced to keep on living. How you can be with someone one night at a party, and then the next morning they die in a car accident. My friend Bradley C. Lybbert did just that. He was killed in a car accident on the way to his high school graduation on Sunday June 13, 2004. He had just been at a party, that I was also at, the night before. And then I find out the next morning that he is gone. It is events like these that make you realize that you don't know when your time is going to come to leave this life. It is times like these that make you realize that you aren't invincible and neither are the ones you love. Brad was a very good young man. He was fun to be around and talk to, he was a very good friend and a really kind person. He is going to missed very much. We will never forget you Bradley. Thank you for being a part of out lives and blessing us. We will miss you, but we will see you again in Heaven.

      Okay yesterday I said that things come in 3's. Well I found out that it holds true for good things too. My third good thing is that I got into AP English for next year. I'm really happy about that and I really wanted wo get into it. I however did not become one of the Vice Presidents for National Honor Society for next school year. I'm kinda bummed about because I would ahve liked to get the chance to be a leader in my school. I've run for class office twice without getting elected and now I won't have the chance to be a leader in NHS. I guess I'm just not supposed to have such a big leadership role at my school. Maybe there is something else I am supposed to do ot maybe the Lord knows that i will be really busy next yeatr that He is protecting from extra stress. I don't know. Maybe someday i will know. But for now things, good and bad, come in 3's.

      People often say that ad things come in threes. But do good things come that way too? If so, then I have 1 more good thing coming, but there are two things which I'm trying for, so which will it be? Alomost 2 weeks ago I became a new member of the South Kitsap High School Acting Ensemble for the 2004-2005 school year. Good thing #1. Then that saturday I became South Kitsap's Junior Miss 2004. I get $1000 for any college I want and I get to go to state in January. I'm so excited. Good thing #2. Now I would like to get into AP English for next school year and I would like to be a Vice President of National Honor Society for next year. So which whill it be? or will I prove the 3-theory wrong and have either 4 good things happen, or maybe only 2? I guess I'll find out soon! As for me I hope to prove the 3-theory wrong, with having 4 good things happen.
