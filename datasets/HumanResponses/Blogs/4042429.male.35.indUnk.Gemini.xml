      No matter your party affiliation, it is&nbsp;difficult to argue with the main points of Jimmy Carter's speech at the DNC.&nbsp; This country of ours is "going to hell in a bucket baby" and I'm not enjoying the ride.&nbsp; My own experience with, what the uninformed call "the welfare system," has shown me that the "System" as a whole is corrupt.    Of course we, just like most people, have no desire to be on, or remain on, any sort of assistance. We would love to be able to stand completely on our own "two feet," if you will.&nbsp; However, as I stated the system is corrupt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard working citizens of this country can be, and often are put under further economic strain because of mistakes made by those people who&nbsp;are paid by the&nbsp;taxes that we ALL pay.  Furthermore the people that process the paperwork that can put struggling families hundreds and possibly thousands of dollars into debt are immune to any responsibility.&nbsp; If one is awarded more money than is allowed, for what ever reason, they are expected to be savoy enough to know that there&nbsp;is an error, report the error, and be prepared to repay the error.  In our particular instance, a case worker in Clay county said 'let me see what I can do with the numbers,' to my girlfriend.&nbsp; We later transferred our case to Lee county and were informed that we had been over paid.&nbsp; And that even though it was the fault of one of their employees, we were being held responsible.  When given a hearing on our situation, the hearing officer (from DCF) said that DCF&nbsp;had followed&nbsp;correct&nbsp;procedure in attempting to retrieve the over payment of nearly $800, and that if we wanted to pursue the mater any further we would have to go through the court of appeals.  This seems rather wrong to me, where is the accountability to do your job the right way the first time ?  I have found that in any 'menial job' my limited post high school education has afforded me, my termination is almost emanate as soon as I gain enough knowledge to make me a valuable enough employee&nbsp;to desire more money.&nbsp; (After all, how does one turn a profit, and line one's pockets with it, if it is shared with the employees who helped to make it for you?)&nbsp; So thusly, it is hard enough to get by to begin with before the 'system' that is designed to help you makes things worse by creating more financial burdens.  First of all is the issue of what is seen to be the poverty level and the limit on how much money one can make in a month.&nbsp; A family of three, like mine, can make no more than $1650 a month, this is merely 130% of the current poverty level.&nbsp; Out of which there should be enough left after taxes to pay all bills including Rent ($600), Electric ($50-120), Phone (2 cells @ $110), Car insurance ($100), Cable/Internet ($100), Food ($300-400), Auto expenses/Gas/maintenance ($100+).&nbsp; This leaves $300 or less for anything not already accounted for; no eating out, no doctors visits, no medications, and no savings.&nbsp; (And even though my son is still covered for healthcare currently, those who provide for, and care for&nbsp;him&nbsp;would have to&nbsp;be facing death, or too ill to&nbsp;work before receiving healthcare.)  Now think about that a minute.&nbsp; This number is divided by 4.3 (the average number of weeks in a month).&nbsp; This means that a single income household of three can make no more than $383 a week gross income (what you end up with after taxes does not matter), or a full time 40 hours a&nbsp;week job paying $9.59 per hour.&nbsp; So thusly a two income family of three, as I understand it, can make no more than an average income of no more than $4.80 per hour.&nbsp; And, if we were to get pregnant right now, then we would be eligible to make up to about $2800. (Krys, wanna get pregnant jk jk)  Anyway, the main purpose of this rant is to say that: while some may not want to support people on "welfare," its nice to know that there is a system in place that is 'supposed' to prevent one from becoming completely destitute.&nbsp; Wouldn't you like to know that if you were in need of assistance that you could receive what was needed without being placed in jeopardy at someone else's folly.&nbsp; And where as I do not agree with having more children to produce a bigger 'paycheck,' I can see the temptation to do so as well as avoid good paying jobs.  However there are some people out there, and I like to think of myself as one of them, who are trying to better themselves and their situation that don't need to be treated like ghetto thugs that are trying to beat the 'system.'  I try to live modestly, eat modestly, and spend modestly.&nbsp; I don't sell drugs, drive a flashy car or wear heavy gold chains around my neck.&nbsp; (I wouldn't even have cable, if I didn't need to utilize it for work.)&nbsp; I also didn't get a degree from college, which has become no guaranty of a high paying job anyway.&nbsp; So why should I, a hard working, generally honest citizen be used by certain parties as a pawn so that others can make more money.
