      Ok, so this is my very first entry in my blog...hmmm, what to say?  I usually lie awake at night with random thoughts running through my head, so I thought maybe if I write it all down during the day, maybe I can get some sleep.  Not that any of it is really worth putting into words, but I think I'll give it a try.  Today I have done absolutely nothing except try to get rid of a splitting headache.  My jaw is aching & I think it's causing my entire head to ache.  I am wearing this stupid appliance in my mouth to try & fix my jaw, but I'm going to get hooked on painkillers before it works.  I did go to the grocery store & buy some milk &amp; stop at the post office to mail a few things, and I took Olivia to a friend's house, but other than that, nothing.  I am annoyed by t.v., have nothing good to read, and don't feel like talking to anyone with my head pounding.  I need a job.  I need to finish school.  The class I need is full.  I am so frustrated by the whole process.  I had an interview last week & he said he'd call me in a week or two to let me know.  It's been almost a week so I am assuming that I am not getting the job.  Surely he has made a decision by now.  I should be studying for my A&P test to finish my Incomplete, but I have lost all motivation.  I'll buy another lotto ticket tonight.  Last week I won $5, maybe tonight will be my big night.  I read a really good book last night, well, finished it last night.  It actually made me cry, which is something I haven't done much of lately.  Even when I feel like it, it doesn't come out.  I am so annoyed at myself, my body, my mind.  It is letting me down.  John is always in a bad mood, worried about money.  I wish I could get him a good job, I've sent his resume to tons of people, I don't know what the problem is.  Jeffery is obsessed with the internet, which is driving me crazy.  I can't wait til school starts.  This summer has been miserable.  It rains constantly & we have no money to go anywhere.  With all of us home together, we are all going nuts.  Life seems so easy for some people, they just sail through w/no bumps.  That must be nice.  Or maybe they are all on xanax.  I really need to get that prescription.  I am so bored, yet to unmotivated to do anything.  I need to paint Jeffery's room.  I so do not feel like it.  I wish Jeff would just pay me what he owes me.  That would help so much.  He is such a piece of shit.  WTF was I thinking hooking up with him?  Hindsight...  I feel sorry for Jeffery, being related to such a shitbag.  Ugh, I guess I can write more on that later...I could probably write an entire book about Jeffery & Olivia's sperm donors.  They are so unbelievable, people have actually told me I should write a book.  Maybe that's where my millions are, waiting for me to write a book.  Unfortunately, I've never gotten rave reviews from any English teachers on my writing.  I'm not exactly entertaining.
