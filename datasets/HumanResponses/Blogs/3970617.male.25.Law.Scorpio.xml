      My daughters will never date men named Glen.&nbsp; I trust Glens even less than I trust Mikes or Matts and you couldn't PAY me to entrust them with anything of even the slightest importance.&nbsp; Matts are date-rapers and test-cheaters. Mikes skim off the register and steal your girlfriend.&nbsp; Glens, however, are on a whole other level of fuckedupedness.   Glens have wispy, prematurely thinning hair,&nbsp; permanent skin and fingernail discoloration from a lifetime of chain-smoking, and they look at least 10 years older than they actually are.&nbsp; They are the fat, pasty-white guys at your 15 year high school reunion who are camped out at the end of the open bar swilling gin and inhaling the Chex Fiesta Mix like the bottom of the bowl holds the secret to eternal youth.   The product of an inordinate amount of time spent indoors, in the dark, prone in front of the television staring at late-night Ronco infomercials, Glens are those guys with zero muscle definition who look like heaps of Jell-O poured into molds purchased from the Failure-At-Life Store.   Glens befriend the bartender and the waitstaff--making painfully-forced small talk as they get drunker and drunker in an attempt to block out the comments their classmates are making about them under their breath:    --Who’s Glen?&shy;  --Jesus, what happened to Glen?  --Hey, I didn't know we went to school with Louie Anderson  --God must really hate Glen  --Hey, that fatass is eating all the Chex Mix!    The indignity is almost too much to bear, even for Glens.&nbsp; But, when you consider that the only reason Glens attend their reunion in the first place is the free food and free booze, it should be no surprise that Glens are the first to arrive and the last to leave.   Glens live at home in the basement surrounded by half gallon milk jugs and Tupperware containers of varying shapes and sizes filled with their bodily fluids.&nbsp; Why is this? you might ask.&nbsp; Well Glens rarely take care of business where business is normally taken care of.&nbsp; They are always too something--too tired, too sweaty, too lazy, too comfortable, too pre-occupied.&nbsp; It is, after all, much easier to roll to one side and rub one out into yesterdays lunch Tupperware than it is to go to the bathroom or the bedroom and risk missing Ron Popeil "set and forget" another fucking Lamb shank in his counter-top rotisserie oven.   Glens also like the weird porn.&nbsp; I'm not talking bondage or foot fetish either.&nbsp; I'm talking anal bukkake gangbang and fisting pregnant Asian women who are missing appendages.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      Hop Sing she rike you put you hand in da poo poo hole rong time.&nbsp; Shove big hand rike jackhammah make Hop Sing scleam velly roud and want to rick you finger.       &nbsp;  Glens love to visit Thailand. They go in small groups with people they meet on the internet--armed with $5000, a small duffel bag, and a stack of mail-order bride catalogues [dog-eared, highlighted, and underlined] that have a number of pages mysteriously stuck together:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Hmmm, BT4565. "Penny." 5'2" 95lbs. Loves to cook and clean.&nbsp; She's 18 (wink, wink)&nbsp;and dreams of moving to Hollywood and meeting Dustin Hoffman   &nbsp;Glens are mouth-breathers and I want them nowhere near my end of the gene pool.&nbsp; They are the Dutch Elm disease of the family tree.&nbsp; Let a Glen park his lemon Jell-O ass on one of your branches and you might as well soak that limb in napalm and strike the match…at least it's quicker.

      I sleep with a flat-head screwdriver.&nbsp; It's lodged between the mattress and the boxspring because I've seen too many Jean Claude Van Damme movies. I have convinced myself that deep in REM sleep and snoring like I invented it, I will sense the presence of a malignant force and--in one fluid badasskungfumotherfucker motion--pull the screwdriver, flip out of bed, and shove it through his neck.   Paint the fence, Daniel-san, paint the fence.   Who am I kidding?! I'll probably just pretend I don't hear him and hope he doesn't try to steal my anal virginity or my Raiders season tickets; if I even wake up in the first place.  _____________________________________________________________________   &nbsp;  Do I get credit for having an impeccable sense of style even if I'm too lazy to put in the effort necessary to pull it off?   I'm inclined to say 'no' unless I pursue a career as a wardrobe stylist or an interior designer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I hate Liza Manelli and love sports...so I'm kind of screwed.  ____________________________________________________________________   &nbsp;  Lazy-Eyed Mormon just told me that her uncle said the reason she was single was because she doesn't like football!&nbsp; HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAAAAAAAA!&nbsp;  FOOTBALL IS THE REASON SHE'S SINGLE!?!  How about the fact that she's 5 feet 7 inches of pasty-skinned, lazy-eyed, snaggle-toothed, double-chinned Mormon idiocy?&nbsp; Oh, well yes...there's that.

      It's 9:10am and I'm already in trouble with the judge for disrupting court proceedings. Let me give you a piece of advice: if you are exhausted in court and need to find something to keep yourself awake do NOT tell yourself all the dirty jokes you know--especially if you're renowned for cracking yourself up. It also helps if you're not fucking retarded...  ___________________________________________________________________   Just before the end of lunch, I went to the men's room to take a leak and wash my hands.&nbsp; The stench was over-powering.&nbsp; Whoever was in the handicapped stall was exorcising some serious rectal demons.&nbsp; As I was washing my hands, the owner of the offending ass emerged from the stall repeatedly looking back over his shoulder with a worried look on his face. I noticed this in the large mirror in front of me and turned to see what he was worried about...   The toilet was overflowing.&nbsp; Large, lincoln-log type turds were floating up over the bowl and onto the green tile floor amidst a river of toilet water, and urine.&nbsp; It didn't seem like it would ever stop.&nbsp; The man stood nervously next to me and started frantically washing his hands--obviously trying to get out of there as quickly as possible.&nbsp; I didn't know what to do, so I did what came naturally:   "Jesus Christ buddy, what'd you eat for lunch? A family of four?!"  -- no response   "If you can do this to a public toilet, I can only imagine what you do to your toilet at home. It must be a Superfund site."  -- no response (his head hung over the sink getting red with embarrassment or rage as he finished drying his hands )  "If I get shit on my shoes, I'm sending you the bill. Do you even work here?"   With that statement he shot me a very stern look, turned and headed for the door.&nbsp; As he reached for the handle, it was pushed open from the other side by one of the clerks from the Records Dept.&nbsp; The clerk shuffled&nbsp;around the man and&nbsp;said, "Pardon me,&nbsp;Your Honor."   Oops.  ____________________________________________________________________   While at trial here in DC, we are working at the offices of co-counsel in a small building near Dupont Circle. They employ as the head of their Office Services Department, a short, shameless black man named Darrell with the personality of a diva--in a non-gay way.   Darrell has yellowing eyes, a missing top front tooth, and a taste for Bud Ice Tallboys (by his own admission as well as the sweet stench of an Anheuser-Busch plant that he wears every morning like cologne).&nbsp; Darrell is always chatty and always smiling--probably because he's drunk. In fact, this man talks to anything with a vagina...and I mean ANYTHING!&nbsp; Coming back from court this afternoon, Darrell came downstairs to help me haul some boxes back into the office. I was pushing the hand truck and he was walking in front clearing a path down the sidewalk when a "woman" passed us going the same direction.   This "woman" was a big girl. A BIG girl. A BIG BIG BIG girl.&nbsp; She was  very  dark,  very  fat, and  very  ugly.&nbsp; She is the kind of girl that&nbsp;might make you and I say "oh sweet jesus, my eyes! My eyes!"&nbsp; Darrell? He shouted at her, "Heeeeey Baaaaaby," then gesturing back toward me, "where you goin'? Come back here and meet my friend Bernard!"    Bernard!!  I nearly pissed myself--partly because Bernard is a funny name and partly because she stopped in her tracks like a buffalo that heard a noise in the grass to consider Darrell's proposition.&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I just start pulling the cart toward the front door of the building laughing hysterically and watching Darrell spit game; completely oblivious to anything else...like, for instance, the fact that the glass front doors were closed. Two steps later--  SLAM!  --the side of my head and my shoulder go straight into double-paned glass. Nice work, NP. Nice work.

      Spending three straight full days in a courtroom listening to expert testimony about semiconductor chips and fighting the impulse to throw yourself in traffic, you start dreaming up some really fucked up things. I noticed this early on and started jotting down the thoughts that crossed my mind. Here is a Greatest Hits Album&nbsp;from the last 3 days:    July 26, 2004 (11:30am EDT)   "Chinese food for lunch today. I'd love to find a restaurant that gives you fortune cookies with fucked up fortunes inside. You could call them MISfortune cookies. I wonder if anyone's ever thought of it? ( authors note: it turns out--thank you Google--that I was not the first person to come up with this idea.&nbsp; Apparently I'm not even the TWENTY-first person to come up with this idea  ) I could come up with some funny shit:  --you're significant other just slept with your next door neighbor --Congratulations, you have cancer --You're adopted --Your family hates you --Your pork chow mein was made with cat. --Rape isn't a crime. It's a past-time --that's not baby fat...you're just ugly    July 27, 200 4 (2:46pm EDT)  "I wonder what would happen if I cracked a beer in the middle of court? I should bring in a small igloo cooler with a six-pack of Tallboys...no no no. I should arrive in a suit with a beer helmet on. OR, I could roll a pony keg up to counsel table and ask anyone who makes eye contact with me if they want to do a kegstand."    July 26, 2004 (1:55pm EDT)--25 minutes after chinese food   "I wonder if the judge would get upset if I farted. A LOT."    July 23, 2004 (8:25am EDT)   "I just found out that the attorney for opposing counsel who is examining our expert went to Stanford for undergrad. I immediately hate him. I consider him the most despicable kind of human being and I have not stopped staring at him with utter and complete disdain since I found out. If I catch him looking at me I am going to jump over the table and hit him in the face with a binder."    July 27, 2004 (10:50am EDT)   "I think the court reporter and I have developed a connection. &nbsp;I'm sitting right near her and&nbsp;she keeps looking over at me and smiling. She's pretty cute...I wonder if I can distract her enough to make her mess up the transcript?  'Dr. Farr is it your testimony that the manufacturing of semiconductor chips require that goddam he's cute I want to have sex with him in the bathroom at lunch strict adherence to MO-220 Industry Standards. '. OH NO, she has a big round potbelly! No wonder she wears so many pants suits!"    July 27, 2004 (3:44pm EDT)    Opposing counsel looks like they were pulled from a comic book convention or the ticket line from the opening night of Lord of the Rings. When I look at them I am at once intrigued and disgusted by the type of pornography these people most likely watch...especially&nbsp;Gus Johnson. Johnson is probably in his mid-50s with beady eyes, a lipless grin, a pale ashen-colored face and a long sloping angular nose reminiscent of New Yorker political caricatures&nbsp;from "Talk of the Town." His suits fit like tarps over mounds of dirt--it's not all his fault really. He's a fucking mess. He's the kind of fat man who looks like he would leak out onto the floor into an amorphous pool of blubber if it weren't for the constrictive, form-shaping nature of men's business apparel.  I don't know if it's just me but I'm pretty confident that if I went to Bangkok next week and asked the cab driver to take me to the section of town with the fellating 10 year old schoolboys, I'd probably run into&nbsp;Gus Johnson

      I had dinner at Pepper's last night in D.C. That, in and of itself, is nothing extraordinary.&nbsp; My BBQ chicken sandwich got its "bbq" straight out of a bottle from the Safeway across the street, my Guinness was served in a plastic water glass, and I actually think I saw the cook slice open the Ore-Ida bag that held my "signature waffle-cut fries."&nbsp; What made this dinner special was the scenery.   If you weren't already aware, 17th St NW on the other side of Connecticut Ave. is D.C.'s own little Castro District.&nbsp; Like The Castro, this little stretch of 17th is remarkably clean--even the homeless look showered and shaved--and well-appointed. Rainbow flags and flower boxes dot the stoops and storefronts along both sides of the street.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;hosts a bevy of over-priced, faux-Italian bistro style restaurants that almost dare passers-by not to come in and spend too much for too little for fear they might seem cheap or pedestrian in their tastes.   Coming from San Francisco, what surprised me about D.C.s mini-Castro was the degree to which it seemed a complete cliche of gay culture.&nbsp; I spent most of my time during dinner people-watching--people dining on the patio around us, people walking up and down the rain-soaked sidewalk, people serving our food.&nbsp; They all seemed to be wearing their Gay Costumes.&nbsp; Nearly every single gay man I saw had short, neatly cropped hair and wore tight fade-front BR jeans and a tight sleeveless t-shirt.&nbsp; I was unaware that sleeveless t-shirts were issued to all gay males once they joined the Gay Army.   I was similarly surprised by the lack of lesbians.&nbsp; Fag-hags outnumbered lesbians by a good 6 or 7 to 1.&nbsp; How would I know, you ask?&nbsp; I'm from San Francisco motherfucker.&nbsp; I own standard-issue San Francisco Gaydar.&nbsp; It was hilarious watching these gaggles of people chatting and laughing and carrying on.&nbsp; Each gaggle had their requisite D.C. gay boys, one super-butch lesbian, and--somewhat oddly--a phalanx of obviously straight girls who think that gay guys just have more fun and won't hit on them ( note to straight girls:  no one is going to hit on you. Why? BECAUSE YOU'RE FUCKING UGLY  !)   There was one great moment from last night, however.&nbsp; About half-way through dinner, one of the guys I was having dinner with called over the waitress to get another plastic-cupped Guinness. He started lightly flirting with her because...well...he could.&nbsp; She reacted like a startled doe.&nbsp; Her eyes widened and she froze in her tracks.&nbsp; Apparently she hadn't been flirted with by a man in some time.&nbsp; This girl was pretty young looking and you got a sense from her reaction to my buddy and to her surroundings that a few months ago she got e-tarded at a Queer As Folk Marathon, hooked up with a girl for the first time, woke up in some house off of 17th Street, and hasn't been able to find her way home since then.&nbsp; I guess Gretel and Gretel ran out of breadcrumbs.&nbsp;   The whole exchange felt like a scene from a Lifetime Movie of the Week.&nbsp; An undercover agent infiltrates the compound of&nbsp;a&nbsp;psuedo-religious cult in order to save a young girl who was drawn in using ill-founded means. He finally gets her alone in&nbsp; a backroom during work detail and exposes himself to her as one of the good guys who is there to get her out.&nbsp; I think the awkward silence at our table lasted a good 30 seconds. As we sat there frozen, a woman walked past our table and, in an effort to maneuver around our waitress-en-tableau, clipped my head with her elbow. The bitch just kept walking!&nbsp; I turned around and stared but she was completely oblivious. Finally, I yelled out "hey lady, usually cold-cocking someone is worthy of an apology unless you're French and don't need an excuse for being a complete bitch!"&nbsp;   As the word 'bitch' flew from my lips, she spun around and came charging back toward my table.&nbsp; I wasn't worried until she got closer and I noticed her abnormally deep voice. And her five o'clock shadow. And her Adam's Apple.&nbsp; Uh-oh.&nbsp; She started screaming.&nbsp; She's bellowing at the top of her lungs like an enraged Harvey Firestein. "You are the rudest person I've ever met!"&nbsp; "I bet you don't even have a girlfriend!" "No woman would stand for someone like you who doesn't know how to treat a lady!"&nbsp; Mind you, at this point my buddy is nearly falling over in his chair laughing.&nbsp; I have a screaming transexual to my left and a cackling attorney to my right.&nbsp; Good times.&nbsp;   Then she broke out the clincher: "As a woman, I find your conduct abhorrent and reprehensible!"&nbsp; I couldn't take it anymore. "As a woman! AS A WOMAN!&nbsp; Dude, YOU'RE A DUDE!&nbsp; You have facial hair! You have an Adam's Apple! Fuck that,&nbsp;that's thing's so goddamn big you must have an Adam's Apple&nbsp; Orchard. &nbsp; You sound like the illegitmate love child of Kathleen Turner and Isaac Hayes!&nbsp; If you're a woman, I'm Marie Antoinette you fucking freak!&nbsp; Now get your tranny-ass away from my table before I call the tranny police, the manners police, and the fashion police to cart your broken-down ass to tranny jail.&nbsp; You're a disgrace to trannies everywhere. Get out of my fucking sight."  That put her over the edge.&nbsp; Now she's bawling  and  screaming.&nbsp; The only thing that saved me from getting clobbered and probably sent to jail for assaulting a she-male was the friend I was eating with.&nbsp; The whole time this tragic comedy is playing out he is bent over, crippled with laughter.&nbsp; Finally, when I told the tranny that the fashion police were going to cart her broken-down ass to tranny jail he fell over in his chair, hit his head on the concrete patio, and knocked himself unconscious.  Now I have a sobbing tranny on my left and an unconscious attorney on my right.  GOOD TIMES!

      I'm on the road this month for trial in a case that, before the day I left, I had never heard of.&nbsp; Working with attorneys I've never met in a town where the people I  do &nbsp; know work all day and head to the shore every weekend, I have been blessed with the opportunity to work closely with a fat girl from one of our other California offices. Her name is Katrina and she's a lazy-eyed Mormon.&nbsp; She's got graying, snaggled front teeth, the fashion sense of an 8-year old&nbsp;Down's Syndrome child, permed red hair, and a huge HUGE ass.&nbsp; She's the anti-viagra.&nbsp; Don't try to throw the football through the tire swing when she's around.&nbsp;   She wore denim capris the&nbsp;other day and I think I threw up in my mouth.&nbsp; There's nothing worse than&nbsp;inadvertantly looking up from what you are doing and catching a glance of a gigantic, denim-clad ass passing in front of you.&nbsp; It felt like I was staring into a denim sun. I quickly averted my eyes so as to&nbsp;avoid the onset of blindness.&nbsp; Unfortunately, all that did was direct my&nbsp;gaze toward her&nbsp;pale, sausage-like calves that--you could tell by the stubble pattern--had been shorn sometime that morning (undoubtedly by an industrial-grade&nbsp;Black & Decker lawn product).&nbsp; A little side note:   there is nothing more unappetizing than the freshly-shaved legs  of a fat girl who doesn't get much sun.&nbsp; Because&nbsp;her skin is translucent, you can see the black hair follicles that have retreated just below the skin &nbsp;after being cut by&nbsp;her (Fat)Lady Bic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Their retreat actually leaves&nbsp;tiny  dimples in the skin that make Fat Girl's legs look like they've been walked  on by golf shoes.&nbsp; It's a horrible, horrible sight and one I don't wish on anyone  Anyhow, as I fought off yet another wave of fat-enduced nausea, my eyes fell upon another horrible sight--her feet&nbsp; (Jesus Christ, I can't believe I am forcing myself to relive this experience. Isn't this what they make&nbsp;incest-survivors and rape victims&nbsp;do in therapy to get past their mental blocks?)&nbsp; Her toes looked like vienna sausages with knuckles and hair.&nbsp; HAIR!!&nbsp; And, like most fat girls swimming in denial, she had her 10-pack of vienna sausages bound inside a pair of Payless Shoe Source sandals that were at least 2 sizes too small.&nbsp; They looked like corsets, the&nbsp;straps of which&nbsp;dug into the pasty flesh of her feet like butcher's twine around a pair of stuffed pork tenderloins. &nbsp;

      I've been living out of a 5th floor hotel room in D.C. for the last three weeks.&nbsp; Room service sucks, the cable package sucks, the pay-per-view movies suck, the porn sucks, the coffee maker sucks, and the comforter smells like someone wiped their ass with it and soaked it overnight in bleu cheese dressing.&nbsp; Mercifully, thanks to the demands of trial and poorly prepared attorneys, I spend little time in my haven of discomfort.&nbsp; Last night, after my keycard demagnetized twice in&nbsp;a span of 15 minutes and room service refused to take my order because I called five minutes after they closed (due to the time I spent convincing some Sudanese reject that I wasn't trying to make her life difficult or stash keys so I--and I quote--"could have loud pahtees in room with many friend."), I decided to have a little fun.&nbsp;   I sat&nbsp;in my room fuming over the indignity of not being allowed to purchase chicken tenders and a bowl of crap-ass soup.&nbsp; Finally, after twenty minutes of pouting, I threw the room service menu against&nbsp;the opposite wall, got dressed, and walked down 17th St to a CVS that was open til midnight.&nbsp; I strolled down the cosmetic aisle and bought two of the brightest richest reddest lipsticks I could find.&nbsp; As I made my way to the counter I started to get a little self-conscious--like the first time you buy condoms or tampons for your girlfriend.&nbsp; What would the clerks think?&nbsp; To balance out the lipstick, I grabbed a Mountain Dew out of the fridge case and a bag of Funyuns.&nbsp; That's when I realized that instead of giving off the impression of being a transvestite, now I was&nbsp;exuding the aura&nbsp;of a transvestite who&nbsp;was going to run home, dress up, and beat off to a pirated copy of Lord of the Rings in front of my computer.&nbsp;   Not good.&nbsp; I should have known better considering where I was.&nbsp; This CVS just happened to be on the periphery of D.C.'s gay neighborhood.&nbsp; A&nbsp;muscular 6'5" white guy with close-cropped hair buying two tubes of bright red lipstick from the CVS on Connecticut and 17th at 11:30pm?&nbsp; For you, that might be weird. For these clerks, that's called Tuesday.&nbsp; So I tossed the Mountain Spew and Funyuns on the floor in Aisle 4 and slapped the lipstick down on the counter.&nbsp; They didn't flinch, of course, and I was back at the hotel before midnight.   To preface this even further, my first few days in the hotel I noticed that the staff was an extraordinarily devout group of disenfranchised African immigrants.&nbsp; Nearly everyone&nbsp;wore some sort of necklace with a cross dangling from it.&nbsp; There was a bible on the coffee table in the lounge.&nbsp; At the bar, there was a bible next to the drink menus and stackable plastic ashtrays.&nbsp; I heard the word "Lord"&nbsp; in the lobby more times over the last three weeks than I'd heard in the last three years of my life.&nbsp; Ultimately, I figured if I was going to fuck with these people, that's how I'd get to them.   I got back to my room just before the midnight edition of Baseball Tonight went into the opening montage.&nbsp; This was going to be great. I was going to fuck with the entire staff of a major hotel chain AND I would get to hear Rob Dibble and Peter Gammons bemoan the state of the Red Sox organization (again)&nbsp;after choking (again)&nbsp;against the Yankees (again)&nbsp;in the first game of a critical weekend series (again).&nbsp; Turning up the volume on the TV, I grabbed my toiletry scissors, the Gideons Bible on the bedside table, the bag of lipsticks, and I went to work:   Step 1:&nbsp; cut out every page except&nbsp;page 666.&nbsp; You'd be surprised how long this takes with a pair of toiletry scissors.&nbsp; I've spent 4 years in a law firm in front of a computer and I think shearing out the pages of a complimentary bible is going to be what gives me Carpal Tunnel Syndrome   Step 2:&nbsp; write something on every page.&nbsp; In lipstick.&nbsp; This part kept me up until 4 a.m.&nbsp; The hard part wasn't coming up with something to write.&nbsp; The hard part was writing it in lipstick on 750 pieces of thin bible paper.&nbsp; To make things easier I settled on a trio of phrases:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;  JESUS HATES ME    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp;  END IT ALL LORD    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.&nbsp;  THIS YEAR'S THE YEAR    Step 3:&nbsp; pick up all 750 pieces of lipsick-covered bible and throw them in the air like I just graduated.&nbsp; The blast radius was beautiful.&nbsp; They scattered gleefully all over the hotel room floor&nbsp;like a psychotically hate-filled&nbsp;Rorschach ink&nbsp;blot.&nbsp; I slept like a baby.   Step 4:&nbsp; before leaving for the office in the morning, place the gutted bible in the middle of the bed, open to pg. 666.&nbsp;   Step 5:&nbsp; laugh hysterically to yourself all day   &nbsp;  I got back to the room around 8:30 tonight.&nbsp; It was UNTOUCHED.&nbsp; I called down and inquired as to why my room wasn't clean.&nbsp; The Sudanese refugee on the other end&nbsp;replied, "maid service refused to clean your room sir.&nbsp; They say it is bad luck because you are a sinner who is going to hell and eternal damnation."&nbsp; I was agape.&nbsp; I didn't know what to say--partly out of shock, partly because I couldn't stop laughing.&nbsp; Finally I collected myself. I said, "well yeah, that's all well and good but tomorrow someone better clean my fucking room," and I hung up.   to be continued, I guess...

      There are five common male names in English nomenclature that produce more nicknames than any other: Robert, Richard, William, Johnathan, and James. These five names and their attendant derivations are responisble for probably 25% of the male section of my high school yearbook. While each of these names is normal and passes through our lips on a daily basis with little, if any, notice, I will forever look askance at any Robert, Richard, William, Johnathan, or James who refuses to take or use a nickname. It is unacceptable. It is unco-operative. It is un-American. The one I am most suspicious of is James.  James is a haughty little bitch. His angst and hostility toward the world and toward adopting a nickname undoubtedly have roots in his childhood. At some point, probably 5th or 6th grade, James had two  other  James' in his class. To differentiate between them, his teacher called one Jimmy, one Jim, and one James.  Jimmy became the class-clown, doing just enough to get by and stay out of serious trouble until he turned 18, went off to a state school for college, and became a career undergrad thanks to hydroponic weed and Saved by the Bell re-runs on the Superstation.  Jim played all the sports and idolized his loser father. He was the first to successfully lie about sleeping with a hot girl from another high school. Jim drank a lot, did stupid shit, got by because his parents were loaded, and ended up doing nothing with his life  James had nowhere to turn for a distinctive male identity. So he fled into the warm embrace of his home economics teacher and her amazing apple strudel recipe. James made a lot of female friends all the way through high school and into his years as an undergrad at Vassar. His female friends bonded with him like he was one of the girls and constantly wondered aloud when some lucky girl was going to snatch him up--all the while secretly speculating as to when he would come out of the closet.  Like any American male trying to feign heterosexuality, James was at once saddened and concerned by his lack of male friends. Luckily, in the middle of his sophomore year at Vassar, James found companionship and solace in the form of Shakespeare in the Park...with other "men" who also refused to take nicknames--Phillip, Ronald, Andrew, Edward...you get the picture.  Oh you don't? Well let me give you one so you know what I mean (you need to be on Friendster to check this one out):  urlLink http://www.friendster.com/user.php?uid=56555   Yeah, exactly. Shit, the man wrote a friend of mine a note that said, and I quote:  "bright cacaphony burning into my synapse perchance we will meet"  Are you fucking kidding me?! Combine that little gem with the progression of the very desperate, very maudlin of circumstances that ARE his life, and it's no fucking wonder James owns a cape. More often than not, he has multiple capes--one of which  must   be  black or dark red crushed velvet.  James was the first person in his school to move from Dungeons &amp; Dragons to playing Magic: The Gathering and owning a full deck. He was (and continues to be) a regular at every Rennaisance Fair he could get his mother to drive him to and he uses words like "damsel" and "indeed" far more often than is either acceptable or comfortable in contemporary American speech.  It's no suprise that James' speech is  affected , though. He refuses to use slang or contractions. If you could see the dialogue bubbles over his head when he speaks--like in comic strips--I guaranfuckingtee you 'theater' and 'center' would be spelled with an "-re." It's like he grew up in the English countryside or the sitting room of William F. Buckley's house.  If Madonna were a man, she'd be named 'James.' And, just like someone needs to tell that pretentious, gap-toothed twat that she's  FROM FUCKING DETROIT !!!, someone needs to tell James that he grew up in Orange County next door to a kid who is now the #2 Skimboarder in the world. His name is Josh... NOT FUCKING JOSHUA EITHER YOU POMPOUS FUCKING DOUCHEBAG !  My favorite part about James is the part he tries to hide. The deviant part. The dark, self-loathing part. Just because his entire wardrobe can be described as "long" and "flowing" and just because he owns a hardbound copy of  Canteburry Tales  IN THE ORIGINAL MIDDLE ENGLISH does not mean that the man doesn't listen exclusively to opera and industrial metal or jab safety pins through his erect penis while staring entranced at his full-sized Michael Hutchence poster and sitting on hold with Ticketmaster trying to get 4 together for the Nine Inch Nails/Marilyn Manson/Slipknot concert coming to the Staples Center this fall.  James projects this faux intellectual intensity that he desperately hopes will at once intimidate and intrigue people. The reality is it just makes him look like an idiot. Dude, it's NOT INTIMIDATING! I wouldn't approach anyone who was sitting alone in the back corner of a cafe who looked like he was trying to push out a turd! So take your Chai Latte and your Foucault reader, and take a big stinking intellectual dump on your own time. You're starting to scare the waitresses.

      My buddy Graham is leaving town for a month or so to hike the Pacific Crest Trail. Last night we met up at a bar in Berkeley so he could give me some shit he was storing for a mutual friend and so we could assail our bodies with unwise amounts of alcohol. We met around 7:30, sat outside on the big patio, had some beers, and got to talking. The conversation went from his great-aunt choking on a chicken bone and then dying because the surgeon sliced her jugular when he tried to excise the bone, to malpractice suits and nationalized health care, to the litigious nature of American society, to the history of Venice as a city-state, to the optimal size of republics, to killing everyone except small enclaves of 1000 people spread significantly apart over the globe. This is where the conversation got interesting:   G:  1000 people is just about right. Small enough where you sort of know everyone but big enough to get a cross-section of skills and abilities.  N:  And enough genetic variation to avoid becoming another England.  G:  Hey dude, I'm English.  N:  Yeah, what's your point?  G:  Seriously though, over the past few months I have become more and more enamored with the idea of just killing everyone except for like a 1000 people.  N:  I see at least 50 on this patio who could go.  G:  Oh no dude, they ALL go. How many of these graduate student dickheads do you think could grow enough food to feed them selves  let alone 1000 people?  N:  Probably none.  G:  PROBABLY!?! Dude, they study post-modernism. All of them. I don't care if they're in med school or the School of Architecture. Somewhere they've used the term "post-modern" incorrectly or they own some bullshit book about it. Dead. All of them.  N:  SWEET!  G:  I know dude, things would be so much simpler.    At this point I noticed that we were getting some looks. Nothing too bad, just some shithead European exchange students who probably heard us say "post-modern" and got erections. Graham, fortunately for us all, continued...   G:  You know where we'd have to start don't you?  N:  Stanford?  G:  No. Well yes, but no. The retards.  N:  HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA  G:  No seriously. Think about how much time and energy and resources are wasted on members of society who don't give anything back. Retards are parasites. Plain and simple. I don't know why human life has so much value to people. THEY'RE RETARDED! THEY DROOL!  This last part was met with a couple "ughs!" from the peanut gallery. I snuck a peek and saw that a few people were listening intently with their mouths agape. Graham had an audience but I don't think he noticed. I, however, did.   N:  Would you stop at retards? I don't think I would.  G:  Of course not. Man, if my wife gave birth to a retard I would smash the baby against the sidewalk and then off my wife.  N:  What? Why?  G:  It's not gonna be MY genetics that turn my offspring into a mongoloid. She pops out a tardpup and she's history  N:  Oh man, that is awesome. You should start a movement.  G:  Nah, people are so touchy when it comes to killing retards. Even parents whose lives have been ruined by some drooling, uncommunicative blob resist the idea. I just don't get it  N:  So who's next? I'd say ugly people. I'm convinced that eugenics wasn't born out of racial hatred or resistance to miscegenation. It probably started because someone was tired of seeing so many goddamn ugly people.  G:  I think you go for the parents of the retards next. When a rabid dog bites someone you destroy the dog don't you?  N:  Then you sell it to a Laotian vegetarian restaurant.  G:  Dude, that's fucked up.  N:  THAT'S FUCKED UP!? YOU WANT TO KILL RETARDS AND THEIR PARENTS!  G:  Yeah, but I have a legitimate reason--the survival of the Republic and the human race as we know it.  N:  If that's the reason, then I would kill 12-18 year olds that have no potential. Kids who have detracted from society to the point where they will most likely never give enough back to balance the scales or who would run the risk of perpetuating their wasteful existence by having kids of their own. Those kids? DIRTNAP!    I noticed that people were leaving or moving far away from us. It's not like we had AIDS or something, we were just speaking the truth.   N:  Next on my list would be the blind.  G:  Really? I think the blind could serve some purpose that would put them lower on the Kill List.  N:  Dude, what purpose do they serve other than to slow down fucking traffic when they cross the street or be great piano playing R&amp;B/Soul musicians. Songs in the Key of Life? Nope. Songs in the Key of DIRTNAP!  This got Graham laughing hysterically. It was almost disruptive. God bless alcohol and a broken moral compass.   N:  I'd probably do the deaf next but they're tricky. Since they can see you'd have to sneak up behind them. That's too much work. So I guess I'd go with the Stanford basketball team next and then France.  G:  See Nils, now your just trying to be funny. I'm serious about this. We have driven this crazy train so far off the evolutionary track that the only way to get going in the right direction is a quick and decisive corrective movement. You know how raising interest rates by multiple percentage points or the bottom falling out of an industry can create a market correction that changes the way people invest and manage their money?  N:  Ummm, sure  G:  That's what this would be. A mass extinction but without the meteor or the nuclear winter. I think it would work.  N:  You're really drunk aren't you?  G:  Yep.  It was at this point that we decided to make our exit and go to a bar that served cocktails and shots and various other concoctions of high-octane forget-juice. Graham and I had several. Of everything. That's all I remember.  My roommate woke me up this morning as she left for work around 6:30. I was on the living room couch. Fallen over. Fully clothed. From the waist up. With a half-eaten Bacon Ultimate Cheeseburger in my hand. There were fries and at least a dozen monster taco wrappers scattered all over the coffee table. I had ketchup all over my face and a huge brown stain down the front of my Mexican-waiter shirt from when I spilled most of my last Irish Carbomb.   R:  Nils, get up and get in your bed.  N:  What time is it?  R:  Early  N:  What stinks in here?  R:  YOUR ASS!  N:  Oh.  R:  Jesus Christ Nils, put some pants on. You look like a retard.

      A couple months ago my friend Will was in town for the weekend and staying at my place. That Saturday morning, after a pretty rigorous night of partying, I came out into the living room to find Will on the couch watching porn on the XBox. The only thing that could have been more disturbing was if he was jerking off when I walked in...and I'm sure that was only a matter of time. I registered my disgust audibly and it was met with laughter and a shit-eating grin. Will knows I don't like porn (the .avi files he was watching belonged to my roommate who, along with his girlfriend, are...how shall I say...connoisseurs), so being the antagonistic prick he is, he likes to put it on whenever he has the opportunity. I contend that porn is boring and superficial. Will argues that it is art. Wait, what? Yep, art. This conversation was going to be fun.  Over the next hour or so, Will tried to convince me that anything that is not a naturally occurring phenomenon should be considered art or, at the very least, an art  form . Bridges, macaroni and cheese, highway overpasses, motor home bathrooms, corn dogs at the Texas State Fair (that one was mine). We went through a litany of thing many of which I granted him either on the merits or for the sake of comedy. I had to draw the line, however, at pornography.   N:  Porn is NOT a legitimate art form, Will! It's the holding pen for the cocaine-addicted incest survivors of this country. I'm convinced porn is a secret government program meant to keep all these miscreants in one place.  W:  One place? You do realize that not all porn stars know each other or live together?  N:  Sure they do. It's called Van Nuys. These people fuck first and foremost for money dude, and that makes porn ineligible for the classification of art or art  form .  W:  Nils, for a smart kid you sure can be close-minded. Art is about personal individual expression. It's not about convention or standards of normalcy or the perceptions of the audience. Just because they fuck for money does not mean what they create is not beautiful or meaningful.  N:  Thank you, Eve Ensler. Are you done with your little vagina monologue? Can we go get some fucking breakfast please? I'm fucking starving.  W:  Dude, you know what I mean. Porn at its very basic level is the artistic expression of personal sexuality.  N:  WILL! THAT GUY JUST SHOVED HIS WHOLE HAND IN THAT GIRLS PUSSY! That is NOT art.  W:  Okay, maybe that part isn't art. But the dialogue in this picture is top-shelf. I know that's what drew me to the Anal Spelunkers series.  N:  No, what drew you to it was the fact that you're a sexual fucking deviant.  W:  Now that was just mean. It's not my problem that my artistic sensibilities are more cultivated than your own. And honestly, I'm not going to take criticism about art from someone who still covers his bedroom walls with signs he's stolen from campus construction sites.  N:  Shut the fuck up dude. Just finish your movie so we can go. Woud you like some privacy Larry Flint? The Jergens lotion and toilet paper are where they usually are…under your fucking pillow.  W:  Nah, I'm fine. I'll just use your couch cushions.  N:  You're such a dick.  W:  Don't worry dude. I'll flip 'em over when I'm done.

      I wrote this about a year and a half ago after going to a basketball game with a friend of mine.    I posted it on the Tucker Max Messageboard and have brought it back here by request and so it gets another moment in the sun. ___________________________________________________________________  Last night I went to the Warriors-Celtics game in Oakland with a buddy from work. The Warriors were getting demolished in the first half so all I had to look forward to was my next drink. We were sitting courtside 7 rows back and, as such, had access to the Club Bar. The Club Bar is never crowded like the concession stands and doesn't have that ridiculous "2 drink maximum, last beer served at end of 3rd Quarter" rule that has so often killed my buzz. My buddy and I took turns getting four drinks at a time (2 Belvedere and Tonics and 2 Crown and Cokes) throughout the first half. By halftime we were shit-housed.  The buzzer sounds at the end of the second quarter and out runs this gaggle of little people in green and white jerseys. I thought I was seeing things. Half the kids bolted to the sideline and a 5 on 5, full court game broke out. Apparently, when I was paying too close attention to one of my crown and cokes, the hoops had been lowered to seven feet and somebody had tossed the ball up for tip-off to a 10 minute scrimmage. Three minutes in and the game had gone nowhere. No one had made a basket. It wasn't until the 5-minute mark that anyone hit the damn rim when, finally, the biggest kid on the floor purposefully grabbed a rebound, started looking around and freaked. He launched the ball toward center court into the hands of the opposing team.  It's at this point that I got suspicious. I got out of my seat, drink(s) in hand and walked OVER the 6 rows of seats in front of me to get a good look at the kids. I almost fell over. It turns out that we were witnessing a scrimmage of the under-13 Bay Area Special Olympics Basketball Team. Tards! Real tards! And there were 16 of them …though I can't be sure because I was counting running and fidgeting little people in a drunken fog. Most of the tards were just standing around waiting to get the ball, but a couple of the kids--conveniently split between sides--had real skills. One kid had a real nice jumper. Another--I'm not sure if he was Lebanese, Iranian, Mexican (how can you really tell when it’s a tard with a unibrow)--has the Tim Hardaway Killer Crossover down to perfection. His only problem was, once he finished with his dribbling exhibition, he had no idea what to do with the ball. Someone would eventually have to come over, grab the ball, and make yet another in a series of ill-advised tard shots.  Time is winding down now and the score is 10-4. I'm screaming at the team in white to get it together and take some good shots but they won't listen to me (it might be worth noting here that upon discovering we were watching tard basketball, my buddy and I each picked a side and bet the next round of drinks on the outcome…I picked the white team). As I am yelling at the top of my lungs for the big tard to "Box out! Box out, goddamnsonuvabitch, Box out!" the PA announcer comes on and says, "OK people, we're coming down to the wire in FIVE, FOUR, THREE…" It's 10-4 and this really skinny tard on my team has the ball and is driving down court. I start yelling "PULL UP, PULL UP," and he pulls up just inside the NBA 3point line at the top of the key and BURIES a jumper at the buzzer. The best part of my skinny tard's shot was that as he shot it he made that little bounce and wrist cock that pro and college players make when they know their shot is going in. As it goes in, his whole team--both sides of the tard scrimmage--mob him in a big, sloppy tard-pile. The crowd is cheering. I'm going fuckin' crazy even though my team just lost and I have to go to the bar and drop 30 plus tip on 4 under-sized cocktails. I'm shouting, "MONEY, THAT WAS MONEY, MY BOY IS MONEY!" People are staring. My buddy is seated crippled with laughter. I start cracking up with him sloshing my drink on the seats in front of me. Then, out of nowhere, almost on cue, the tardpile scatters and all the kids race to center court for a team photo. You couldn't have beaten the smiles off their faces. The photographer snaps a couple of great shots, tells them he's done and, I swear to god, the whole team takes a victory lap around the court! They're getting high fives from the media guys on the other side of the court and fans sitting behind the players benches. Not willing to miss a single MOMENT of this, I leap over the 6 rows in front of me again (spilling my vodka tonic down my leg) and give each one of them a high five. It was awesome! They made a full circuit, stopped, waved to everyone with that limber, non-jointed tard wave that has become the trademark of tard greetings, and bolted off the floor. I challenge ANYONE to come up with better halftime show entertainment than pre-teen tard basketball.

      One of my roommates and one of my best friends work as lab techs at a large biotech firm in the Bay Area.  As the nature of lab work requires a lot of sitting around and waiting for shit to incubate, they--along with the rest of the people they work with--have a lot of time to kill.  Because everyone works pretty closely and because they are all a bunch of nosy bitches, the lab as a whole gravitates toward shit that one or two people have found to occupy their time.   Last year it was browsing the "Missed Connections" and "Casual Encounters" sections of Craigslist.  This year it's setting up profiles on Friendster and Match.com, trolling for suitable mates, and sending them through the vetting process that is the ruthless public scrutiny of everyone in the lab.  The other night, I was chatting with my roommate and she started showing me some of her co-workers' profiles as well as those of the people some of her co-workers have either "winked" at or gone out with.  Like anything else on the internet, the cross-section she showed me ran the gamut.  My favorite? A 28-year old guy whose unsername is "Puppysmile."  Anyway, she told me I should put one up because it's funny to see who "winks" at you and partly, I'm sure, because she wants me to get a girlfriend. So I did.   urlLink www.match.com   my username is naparker  have fun

      I love Cinco de Mayo. I love going out in the city. I love free booze. I wrote a little song about. Like to hear it? Here it goes... _____________________________________________________________________  On a day celebrated by Mexican-Americans in commemoration of the Mexican Army's single victorious battle over the French (pause here, pick your jaw up off the floor, catch your breath, and read on) at Puebla in 1862, I went out drinking Monday night with an Irishman (Jack), a Pakistani (Samir), and a Puerto Rican (Cesar). How the fuck does that work? It was their treat, though. So I didn't give a SHIT how it worked as long as it involved alcohol. Lots of alcohol.  We start the night around 8 at a new English pub around the corner from my office. It generally sucks, thus requiring me to find/create/instigate my own fun. As we make our way to the back of the pub we pass a table full of white guys in sombreros and ponchos drinking pitchers of wine margaritas. As I am more interested in getting my drink on at this point, I merely make a mental note of the ridiculousness inherent in their situation and head to a back table. They'll get theirs.  Jack broke up with his live-in girlfriend of 2 years that weekend and he was ready to get fucked-in-half drunk. He's been my copy-vendor for the last year or so and not once had I seen in him the determination he exhibited when attacking his beers and his shots. I drink quick. He drinks quicker. We spend the next couple of hours getting trashed and bullshitting when it comes out that Jack was an Army Ranger in the first Gulf War. I am floored by this revelation and proceed to pump information out of him while, at the same time, pumping alcohol into him. He told us some stories that could make your testicles bid a hasty retreat into your abdominal cavity. The most interesting tidbit that came out, however, was how to kill a man with a knife:  Step 1: from behind, slit his throat Step 2: two quick slashes across his chest like an "X" Step 3: stab him in the nuts (pause for collective male wince) Step 4: plunge knife into the inner thigh, severing the femoral artery  Steps 2 and 3 might seem superfluous to those of us who lack the penchant for bloodlust, but they have a purpose. They are intentionally non-fatal to trigger the victim's instinct for escape. This gets the adrenaline pumping instantaneously. Multiple wounds + adrenaline + severed femoral artery = 30 second bleed out and flatline. SWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET!!  Jack immediately became the coolest person in San Francisco. Samir and Cesar have heard these stories before since they work with him. They weren't as impressed. Their lack of awe bothered me. So I told them they'd be well-served to display a sufficient degree of amazement or I would gut them like Luau pigs with my new-found knowledge and mash their intestines into poi. Everyone got a big kick out of that one. But I was serious. I was also pretty drunk. So it's really anyone's guess.  The rest of the time at the pub was pretty uneventful except for a couple moments:  ---our waitress was this mulatto princess named Jennifer. She had ass, attitude, tight clothes, and she was serving us lots of alcohol. I was enamored with her and told her so every time she came over. Once, as she went to the bar to get us what turned out to be the last round in a long line of rounds, I got up and yelled to her. "HEY, JENNIFER! DO YOU KNOW HOW GODDAMN HOT YOU ARE!? YOU SHOULD BE THE POSTER CHILD FOR MISCEGENATION!!" I thought this was the funniest thing in the world. So did most of the white people in the pub. No one else got it.  ---this prompted the 22 year-old pip-squeak floor manager to come over and warn us to pipe down or get out. I inform him that we are not going to listen to a word he says until he stops shopping at ROSS, goes through puberty, and can kill my buddy Jack here with his bare hands. He thinks I am joking. I am not joking. He somehow musters the courage to tell us to get the fuck out or face, and I quote, "the beating of your lives." At this point Jack stands up and I am praying to all that is holy and true that he will put into practice the knife lesson he taught me at the table earlier in the night.  Unfortunately, he tries to be "diplomatic." He's not getting anywhere with the low-rent Doogie Howser though, so he turns to veiled threats. Jack leans forward and whispers to him (he relates this to me later), "we are just having some fun. Why don't you do the smart thing and back off. I have at least a $400 tab going back there and if you try and kick us out I won't pay it. I will get my credit card before you have a chance to swipe it. Believe me…I will." Apparently this is enough to convince Neil Patrick Harris to go back to rolling silverware or straightening coasters or doing whatever the fuck he does as floor manager.  ---Funnily enough, we decide to leave 20 minutes later. Fortunately for me, the gaggle of honkies in Tijuana Gear hasn't left. I ask the guy at the head of the table if he owns a mirror. He tells me to shut up. I tell him that he and his entire crew look like a living, breathing promotional video for the benefits of eugenics and partial-birth abortion. This doesn't amuse them. Another guy starts mouthing off and asks the foolishly rhetorical question, "What are you trying to say?"  I inform him that what I am trying to say is that each one of their fathers should have pulled out when they had the chance. That San Francisco would have been entirely better off had each one of them just been a blowjob. That their parents should have been sterilized 30 years prior and short of that each one of them should have had their skulls crushed and brains sucked out during birth.  The dork at the end of the table snaps back at me. "Man you're such an idiot. I'm not even from Frisco." I was absolutely dumb-founded. How do you respond to that? I mean, honestly! So, I do what comes naturally and snatch one of the pitchers of frozen margarita off the table and start chugging it. I get about two gulps down and realize that these are wine margaritas. I register my disgust with the drink and the party full of idiots by spraying the contents of my mouth across the table. At this point my buddies are laughing hysterically and someone at their table has gotten up to get Doogie. Needless to say, we leave.  Outside the pub waiting for a cab, Samir (the only married guy in the group) gets the brilliant idea of going to a strip club. I hate strip clubs. HATE. THEM. I am, however, outnumbered. So I relent with the single stipulation that the place has to serve liquor. In San Francisco, this means we can only go to topless clubs. They agree. We get in a cab and tell the driver to take us to the Hustler Club.  We pile out directly in front of the club and MOB down the stairs past the doorman collecting the cover. We get to the bottom of the stairwell and Jack starts waving his credit card in the air and yelling. "I'M A VIP GODDAMNIT. A V.I.FUCKING.P. I WANT CHAMPAGNE. I WANT BITCHES. AND I WANT THEM YESTERDAY GODDAMNIT!!" The manager meets us just inside the club and tells Jack that he needs to calm down. That the Hustler Club is a classy establishment. That his customers expect a certain degree of decorum. This sends me into a fit of laughter. The manager, who has introduced himself as Larry, asks me what I think is so funny. So I tell him. In a very loud voice. "THIS IS A GODDAMN TITTY BAR. YOUR SUIT IS OFF THE RACK FROM MERVYN'S AND YOU HAVE GLOW-IN-THE-DARK PLASTIC SHOTGLASSES. WHO ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING!!" Larry is not pleased with me but, I don't know why, seats us in the VIP section. Not more than 2 minutes later 4 girls with 4 bottles of champagne come over.  Apparently, Jack has given Larry his company AMEX to cover the bill. Normally this would provoke a cautionary note from the cardholder to his fellow spenders. In this instance, however, the handing over of the credit card was accompanied with the equivalent of a Papal Bull. We had carte blanche. In Jack's words, "Go to town fellas. Go to town." I don't think he was aware of how much things cost in a topless club. Samir had 3 dances. From the same girl. Jack and Eric both had 2 from different girls.  I sat there and drank champagne and vodka tonics with a little topless strumpet in my lap. She was hotter than shit. She was also dumber than shit. SURPRISE! Her stage name was Meghan but her real name was Amanda. Creativity was not her strong suit. She spent 2 hours trying to give me a dance and telling me that I was the cutest guy she'd seen in the club in a long time and that there are certain things "not on the menu" that she would "give me." At this point I decided that if she wasn't going to leave me alone I was going to fuck with her. I alternated between arrogant prick and sweet romantic pushover nearly every two minutes. Nothing worth noting happened over the next hour or so, but some of my lines were priceless. These are in chronological order:  --baby, you're dealing with a future lawyer. In 3 years you'll be paying ME to fuck YOU. --Amanda, you have got to be the most beautiful woman in here hands down. How do you not have a boyfriend? I would pay to be your boyfriend. I bet you get that a lot. --girl, I don't pay for SHIT. Do I LOOK like a black man?! --how about this. We will rock-paper-scissors for a dance. Best out of three. You win I pay you the cost of a dance. I win, you give my buddy Samir here a free dance. You aren't going to win though because I am WAAAAAY smarter than you. --Amanda, I would love to take you out for a nice lunch tomorrow afternoon. Maybe take a walk in Union Square. Feed the pigeons. Talk. --the only way I am going into the champagne room is if you BEG me and let my Labrador retriever eat peanut butter off your body.  I don't know how, but this girl ATE MY BULLSHIT UP. She couldn't stop laughing and smiling. I felt like a king. A king with a very full bladder. I got up, took a leak, bullshitted with the bathroom attendant, got some air. I came back in the club and saw from across the room that she was trying to surreptitiously look through the gym bag I was carrying. So much for feeling like a king.  I go back to the table and I tell her I saw her looking through my bag. I'm fucking fuming at this point and I'm about to go tell Larry what happened when she starts bawling in the chair. Big, 5-year-old, you ran over my puppy, tears. I ask her why she's crying, if it's because she's afraid she's gonna lose her job? She blubbers to me that that isn't it at all. She just really liked me and was trying to find some I.D. because she couldn't remember my name and didn't want to seem insensitive….  RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIGGGHHHT! I wasn't buying it for a second. It was, however, a perfect opportunity to try and fuck a stripper. I immediately put on the sensitive, charming, romantic hat and started spewing hallmark cards. My performance was positively brilliant.  2am rolls around and it's time to leave. The lights start to come up and Jack and Samir are over at the bar settling the tab (Cesar had gone home an hour earlier). I start to walk over there and a stripper catfight erupts over by the restrooms. These two flesh-peddlers are beating the shit out of each other. One girl (a black-haired white girl) is grabbing the other (a big-breasted Latina) by the hair and smashing her head into the carpet. The Latina is gouging the white-girls legs with her nails in retaliation and drawing blood. Finally, Larry comes over to break it up and try to shoo me out. I tell him I'm with the guys at the bar.  I walk over there and ask them what is taking so long. Jack's card is being declined. The tab is $4100. I am speechless. So I go over to where Amanda is sitting and tell her I want to take her home. She says she will pick me up outside the little pizza place up the street at 3 and goes back into the dressing room to shower and change. I head back to the bar and Samir has finally convinced the bartender to just run the card on the manual slide, take the slip to the bank the next night, and Jack will rectify the situation with AmEx the next morning. Little did Samir or I know that while Jack was outside earlier in the night going to the ATM he also called AmEx and had them put a hold on the card. Genius. Pure fucking genius.  Samir, still unaware of Jack's antics, is fuming mad. He wants to go into the dressing room and see the girl who gave him 3 dances. Larry just laughs at him and starts pushing us physically up the stairs. This infuriates Jack who starts yelling and threatening. I am laughing uncontrollably. This is a bad thing because it makes my stomach hurt. I throw-up all over the stairs. Now Larry is pissed and calls all of his security staff up to the front. At this point we figure it's probably a good idea to leave and we start jogging up the stairs. We are met at the top of the stairs by a guy who looks like Stone Cold Steve Austin. He pushes us into the street and tells us never to come back. He turns to head down the stairs pulling the door closed behind him when Jack snaps, runs at the door and kicks the hell out of it. It slams. Against Stone Cold's hand. He kicked it so fucking hard it crunched the bouncer's fingers, rebounded all the way open, and closed again. We could hear him screaming as we bolted around the corner for the pizza place.  At this point Samir decides it would probably be wise if he cabbed it home--being married and all. Jack and I walk into the pizza place and bust out laughing at the absurdity of the last 3 hours. This of course hurts my stomach some more and I run outside to throw-up in the street. Again. I go back inside, order two slices, and come back to Jack still laughing. Out of nowhere we here a voice tell us to shut the fuck up. We look over and it's two San Francisco County Sheriff's deputies scarfing down pepperoni pizza. Being quiet, finishing my pizza, and going home was the wise move. Do you think I made that move? I didn't think so.  I look over at them and I ask them which part of the regular police exam they failed; because the sheriff's office is where failures and fatasses go if they want a job that lets them carry a gun. I ask them which ones they were. The Failures? Or the Fatasses? They immediately get up and tell me to get to my feet. I tell them to go fuck themselves. I am waiting for a stripper to pick me up so I can fuck her brains out. The shorter of the two deputies tries to pick me up by my shirt collar when Jack bolts up.  I tell the deputies that Jack was an Army Ranger and can kill each of them with his bare hands before either of them would even have a chance to draw their guns. This elicits a smile from one of the deputies. He tells Jack that he was in the Army. 12 years. I laugh and ask if it was in the Motor Pool or the MPs. This doesn't amuse the other deputy and he threatens to arrest me. I inform him that not only does he not have jurisdiction, but that he probably can't spell it either. The Army deputy tells us to leave and, for once, we do what we're told. Sort of.  I still have a slice left. As we walk out I hurl it against the side of the Sheriff's van in full view of the deputies. Jack and I sprint down the street and down the alley to the back door of the Hustler Club. I start banging on the metal door until somebody answers. It's Samir's girl. I ask her if Amanda left and she says no. I tell Samir's girl to tell Amanda to hurry up and meet me out back. She finally comes out. Jack is long gone and I am hiding behind a dumpster in case the deputies roll down the alley. I pop out, trying to act nonchalant after hiding behind a fucking trashbin like a bitch, and tell her to take me home. Absolute shot in the dark, but she says okay. This girl is a fucking whore. A lying, stealing fucking whore. I hate lying, stealing fucking whores. So I decided I would hate-fuck this lying, stealing fucking whore.  We get back to her place--a two-bedroom she shares with two other strippers. We go in her room and start going at it. I last like 5 minutes because I am shit-housed drunk and exhausted. She gets up to shower the stink off her. As she closes the door I see her little metal box on the bureau across the room. It was the one she was carrying in the club that she put all her money in. I remember that she was going through my bag earlier. I get a brilliant idea. I throw on my clothes as quick as I can, grab the box and run out of the apartment.  I have no idea where I am. Somewhere in The Avenues but where exactly I don't know. I start running toward downtown until I see a cab. It felt like I ran 2 miles. It was probably only 3 blocks. I get in the cab and tell the driver Berkeley. I catch my breath and starting cracking up. This hurts my stomach. Again. And, again, I puke. This time out the window. The cabbie asks if I'm okay and I shrug him off. Then I get the great idea to call my friend Stydie and tell him what I did. He didn't answer so I left a message.  Amanda's little metal box had just over $700. I am giddy. Fifteen minutes later we are driving over the Bay Bridge listening to Tumbling Dice by the Stones when I get another brilliant idea. I roll down the window and CHUCK THE LITTLE METAL BOX OFF THE BRIDGE AND INTO THE BAY. I giggle all the way to Berkeley. Until it's time to pay the driver. $47.60. I look in my billfold and there is no money. I am officially stupid. Now I have to go to an ATM, so I have the driver take me to the nearest Wells Fargo. Unfortunately, I forgot to activate my new ATM card. I am officially stupid and officially fucked. I have him drive me back to the BART station where my car is parked with assurances that my checkbook is in the glovebox. Cabfare + tip? $58.80. FUCK. And, no little metal box.  I get in my car, gun the engine and take off. I go screeching around the corner, Hollywood-Stop a major intersection and go shooting up the hill. Just as I made the dog-leg right up the hill I saw a police car flip a bitch and come back in my direction. His sirens weren't on and I didn’t see any flashing lights, but I was CONVINCED that the pig was coming after me. I floor it. I'm doing 65 up tight, twisting, hilly roads at 4A.M., drunk and exhausted. Wise it was not. I get to the top of the hill, make the right, and red-line it for the last 1/2 mile stretch to my house. I don't know if the cop is behind me, but I am SURE he is tracking me. I bring the car to a screeching halt, grab my bag, and run inside. I sprint down the stairs, into the back yard, up into the sideyard between the houses and lay down flat in the bushes waiting to see if the cop would roll by and stop.  That's where I woke up at 9AM. 5 hours later.

      One of the questions nearly every law school application asks is whether you've been convicted of a felony or an alcohol-related misdemeanor.  In applying to schools across the country a couple years ago, I wrote this piece to add to my packet.  I found it today and could not stop laughing _____________________________________________________________________   On  May 7th, 2001, I pled guilty in Marin County Superior Court  to the charge of Driving Under the Influence for which I was arrested several weeks earlier.   On the evening in question, I got into an argument on the phone with my girlfriend of one year.  She was up the coast about 100 miles in Sea Ranch, California visiting her mother.  Upon hanging up from that conversation I went out with a handful of people to celebrate the recent employment of one of our friends.  Over the course of the evening I had several vodka tonics and a series of conversations in which my friends and I determined it would be a good idea to drive up to Sea Ranch and iron things out with Kate, my girlfriend.  As such, I left the bar and started driving north toward Sea Ranch.  Feeling completely sober, I approached the first of several exits one must take to get to Sea Ranch from Berkeley and followed what I thought were the appropriate signs.  Unfortunately, I took a wrong turn and found myself lost just south of San Rafael.  Driving up Highway 101 at this point, I reached into the glovebox for a map and let the car swerve to the right as I did so.  Behind me 100 yards or so was a California Highway Patrolman.  Having witnessed the car swerve, he turned on his lights and pulled me over.  Smelling alcohol, I'm sure, he asked me to step from the vehicle.  He administered a field sobriety test which I passed.  He then administered a breathalyzer test which I failed.   At my court appearance on May 7th I pled guilty to the DUI charge and agreed, as a first-time offender, to attend and complete an alcohol education/awareness program.  I enrolled with Occupational Health Services in Oakland and completed the program in short order.  While I--and people who know me well--can confidently say I do not have a problem with alcohol, I participated actively during the Saturday morning sessions and learned valuable lessons about myself, about the nature of addiction, and about impaired driving.   Since this unfortunate and disappointing incident, I have not gotten behind the wheel after having even the slightest amount of alcohol nor have I gotten in a car with someone who has been drinking.  While no one wants to be convicted of DUI, I have taken several positive things from this otherwise negative experience and used them to make me a better person.  Ultimately, I am focused, excited, and ready to spend the next three years studying that which I broke when I got behind the wheel after drinking---the law.

      I went to IKEA tonight to shop for a dresser and a bookcase. It took me the better part of three hours to look at every single dresser and bookcase they stocked and come to the realization that  I'M EMPLOYED!    I am not going to pay money to build my own fucking furniture. What the fuck is this? The New Yankee Workshop? I don't have a full beard. I don't have a closet full of long-sleeved flannel workshirts. And I certainly don't have an impenetrable New England accent that's rendered even more indecipherable by the constant screeching  OF A FUCKING TABLE SAW UNDERNEATH A GODDAMN BOOM MIC!  I want my furniture fully assembled, delivered at my leisure, and placed exactly where I want it by a team of gloved men who offer me something cold to drink while I sit back and watch them toil.  As I came to that conclusion over the course of three hours, my concentration understandably waned. Taking periodic breaks from looking at poorly constructed Swedish bedroom furniture, I was able to look around at the other shoppers. This is what I discovered:  1. lesbian couples love IKEA and shop like men. They know what they want generally but, like obscenity or gay men in a 24 Hour Fitness locker room, they won't know specifically until they see it. Once they find what they're looking for they check the price, double-check with  each other  that this is for sure what they want, and then head down to the "self-service bins" to pick-up their unassembled selection. Watching it happen at least a half dozen times last night in practically the same fashion each time was both shocking and refreshing  2. fat girls should not be friends with other fat girls because all they do is tell each other they look cute in clothes that are clearly too small for them. That is just patently offensive to those who have just eaten and those who lack the intestinal fortitude to handle the sight of cellulite and cottage cheese spilling forth from those places inexorably squeezed outward by the physics of ill-fitting belly shirts and low-rise Frankie B jeans.  3. when married men come to IKEA with their wives they shop like recently-neutered puppies. The wife walks ahead knowingly with a list and the credit cards, while the husband follows behind obediently feeling like he's done something wrong to deserve what he's going through even though he knows somewhere inside his bewildered mind that it's all for the best.  4. while I recognize that pink is in as  the  color of kitschy home furnishings this year, women between the ages of 16 and 33 need to realize that decking your apartment out in pink will not change the fact that  YOU'RE STILL ALONE BECAUSE YOU'RE UGLY AND FAT!     And that, ladies and gentlemen, is one to grow on...

      I just got a call from my god-daughter Ellen. She was on her mommy's cell phone.  She called to say hi. This was our conversation just a minute ago:  E: Hi Neeny-boy, it's Ellen. N: Hi Elly-bell, whatcha doin'? E: Nuffin' hey guess what? N: What? E: Dee-tee showed me how to use mommy's phone!   Ellen couldn't pronounce her sisters names very well when she was 2 and 3.  Christen became Dee-tee and Lauren became RoRo.  Those names have stuck...much like Neen.     N: really? that's very cool. E: Yeah, I called daddy and gramma and Oma and Kelly and Tante Yenni and-- N: Tante Yenni?! In Germany!? E: I don't know where she is silly it doesn't say on the blue-lighty screen. All it said was Tante Yenni.   I guess Christen heard Ellen say those last few words   C: ELLEN!! You called   GERMANY!?!   E: I told you I don't know already jeez! N: Ellen?...Elly-Bell?.... E: okay bye Neeny-boy  click>     urlLink    Ellen (4), Christen (11), Lauren (9)

       I am friends with all of my ex-girlfriends except for two.  There's Tiffany, who cheated on me in college with a guy in my House, got pregnant as a result, and came over one night a few years later to go down on me. I called her a Cum Dumpster during climax. She ran out crying and slept on the golf course.  And then there's Sunny. She's Thai. She's ridiculously attractive. And she's a waitress. None of these things have changed since she fucked the Receivers Coach of my high school football team while we were dating in college. She met him at a fundraiser my high school threw for the athletic program. Apparently they hit it off. Whore.  Our relationship was, by all accounts, a tumultuous one. It ran hot and cold like a Motel 6 shower. One week things could never be better. The next one of us would want to shove the other down an elevator shaft. The breaking point came--naturally for us--over something completely ridiculous.  One evening I decided to go to an A's game with my friend Will. As she recounted angrily in a voicemail message I would receive later that evening, I neither informed her of my decision nor--and this is a quote--"asked her permission." I really didn't think much of the decision to go because we didn't have any plans for that evening. Of course in her head Sunny had already planned a quiet romantic evening at her place. Operative words being: " IN HER FUCKING HEAD! "  The game was unspectacular as I remember except for the surprising and pleasant lack of cell phone calls. Not a single one. Very unlike Sunny. As it turns out, MCI Worldcom was having some service problems. This meant that calls weren't finding their destination and were being routed to voicemail. When service got restored later that evening (on BART somewhere between MacArthur and Ashby stations) any dropped calls that were routed to voicemail started to queue up in my phone. Grand total? 6. All from Sunny.   SIX!   I showed Will. He laughed right in my face. Dick.  Like any string of voicemail messages born out of the paranoid fantasy that you are being ignored and/or cheated on by your boyfriend, Sunny's messages got increasingly...well...violent. I was pretty toasted at this point in the evening so I found most of them hilarious. I would even re-cue them and let Will listen. Then I listened to Number 6. The MOAB.  S: Nils, I am through with you. I'm tired of you ignoring me all the time and spending time with your friends. When I hear you are out with  Will  or  Don  or  Draper  it makes me want to scratch your eyes out with my bare hands. Fuck you. I'm fucking Freddy B too. You know the coach guy you introduced me to at that stupid high school fundraiser you dragged me to. I fucked him at the party and I've been fucking him ever since. We're in love too so fuck you.  Ouch. I would have been really hurt by her little diatribe if I wasn't swimming in unrelenting anger instead. I let Will listen to the voicemail. He stopped laughing. When I saw Will earlier this summer in Portugal, this little incident came up and he told me what was going through his head at the time:  W: See Nils get yelled at. Laugh at Nils. See Nils get cheated on and dumped. See Nils boil with white hot rage. Stop laughing at Nils. Stop making any sudden movements. Get off train.  When I got back to Berkeley I made a beeline to Sunny's apartment. She was waiting. Eagerly. We went at it for what felt like hours but what turned out to be only 30 or 40 minutes. Of course it didn't serve any greater good or purpose to yell and scream at each other like a Sicilian family reunion. I mean,  maybe  it was therapeutic but I would be lying if I said I didn't want to hurt her the way she hurt me. Unfortunately, I am not a soulless cock-swallowing Southeast Asian hooker...so my words would have to do. They would have to do, that is, until my eyes fell upon something I gave her for her birthday during the honeymoon phase of our relationship.  Sunny LOVES Brian McKnight. Any and all things Brian McKnight are usually good enough to salve wounds, stem the flow of tears, and calm the screaming she-beast. Her favorite Brian McKnight song is "Anytime" so for her birthday I had a caligrapher in Chinatown paint the lyrics on a piece of really cool parchment paper. Then I had a friend of mine who worked the doors at the Paramount Theatre (where McKnight was going to play a couple weeks later) get it signed. I framed it in bamboo and no-glare glass.  Beside being a cool gift, the whole thing was actually quite beautiful...at least until the little Thai hooker cheated on me. In the middle of yelling at her for being a lecherous, disease-communicating, curry-eating cunt (  Note to female readers: if you don't like the C-word I have a piece of advice for you--DONT FUCKING CHEAT! ),   I spotted the framed piece on the wall above her bed. I charged past her, leapt onto the bed, grabbed it off the wall and threw it against the hardwood floor.    It shattered like the hopes and dreams of an ugly girl with ovarian cancer. Cheap fucking Chinatown framejob. When she realized what I did I thought she would descend into an even deeper darker realm of insanity and attack me like a fucking puma. Instead, she crumpled onto her bed and started sobbing uncontrollably. Yeah, that's right bitch. Fuck you. I grabbed the paper off the floor and walked out.  ...  Anyway, I was cleaning my room Monday night and I came across the tattered parchment in the back of one of my nightstand drawers. I had completely forgotten about the parchment and what I did to it when I got home that night. Below is a transcription of the lyrics on the parchment paper. What I did to it that night is in bold italics.  Anytime I can't remember why we fell apart

      Last night I drifted to sleep around 11:30 upon the soothing wave of words from Dr. Drew's monotone STD advice and Adam Corolla's gravelly indignation. I was unceremoniously yanked from my descent into REM sleep about 15 minutes later by the buzzing of my cell phone on the nightstand. It was my friend Becca. I answered...foolishly.  In that short period during which I am drifting into sleep, I am more vulnerable than a baby bird. If I were the Prime Minister of Israel and pulled out of my creeping slumber by a phone call from Yasser Arafat, it would not be unlikely that the Palestinians would have a State by morning. When Becca called   I thought she was my ex-girlfried Kate, I thought I was in D.C., and I was convinced she was being chased. That last bit made me shoot straight up in my bed.  Over the next 90 seconds, I was able to get my bearings and realize that she was not, in fact, Kate nor was she being chased. Rather, it just sounded that way because she was drunk and she was talking a mile a minute. This is when I knew I was in trouble...yet I stayed on the phone. FOR THE NEXT TWO HOURS! Like a baby bird, I swear. Becca had just returned from an evening of drinking with her friend Sabrina and Sabrina's boyfriend Dan.  Sabrina is a nice enough girl. I've only hung out with her a couple times--both of which I spent surreptitiously examining her eyebrows...which she had ruthlessly plucked like a self-loathing cutter. Both times I've hung out around her she had them penciled back in like someone just told her a childhood friendwas coming to visit. During our sporadic conversations, she usually had something interesting to say. Which was good. Dan, her boyfriend, however, did not. Which was bad. Dan is an ex-Marine turned lawyer (all of them are lawyers in fact). I've only met him once and immediately got the sense that he didn't want to be there and was in a race against the hands of his watch to get the hell out.  Becca and I have been pretty good friends for the last few years. We are actually quite different in a number of pretty important respects, but we have a good time when we hang out. We go to Warriors games and jokingly mock the poor minorities in the upper deck who can't afford tickets in "the lower bowl." We go to movies--less to enjoy a good film and more as an opportunity for me to offer a running commentary on the crappiness of actors specifically and American cinema generally. And, we hook up every once in awhile--usually when one or both of us has been drinking. This is where things get sticky...figuratively you sick fuck.  Becca likes me. No, I mean she  LIKES  me, likes me. It's pretty obvious to casual observers and it's an issue that we have never really dealt with head on. After we hook up, nothing is said about it...at least not until she gets drunk and brings it up in passing with something like "every time we hook up I think we should have a talk, but..."  She knows I'm not interested in a romantic relationship by virtue of the fact that I have dated women during our friendship and have not done anything that can be perceived, even remotely, as boyfriend-like. I think Becca also knows that-- even if I was interested --the major differences I alluded to above would render it over before it ever got started. She has, I believe, accepted that we are always going to be, to borrow a cliche, "just friends." Unfortunately, the romantic feelings she had/has and the expectations she has for relationships of any type between men and women were poisoning her perspective on our friendship.  Not having dealt with this issue directly--the nature of our friendship being   the crux of it--came to a head last night. I was groggy as shit, but even I could sense that it was coming. Like the collapse of the Dolphins in December or the A's in Game 5 of a first round playoff series, it was inevitable.  It started with Becca asking me why I think Dan never tells Sabrina how much he likes her and spiraled downhil from there This is a pretty accurate paraphrase of the pertinent parts of our conversation:  B: What's wrong with men do they not think about these things do they not have these feelings are they just cold human beings who don't have or express emotion why doesn't Dan tell Sabrina how much he adores her I mean I see her every day and we tell each other constantly how much we adore each other why doesn't he do that is that just a guy thing do guys think it's gay or something  N: Wait. What?   B:  Well they've been together for quite awhile now and he's never said anything about how he feels about her not once and Sabrina is sit left wondering with no idea I mean what IS that do YOU do that you DO you DO DO THAT what's wrong with you you never tell ME how much you like ME I think I can count on one hand the number of times you've complimented me or said something nice to me  N:  You're my friend. They're in a relationship. Expressing things like that are things you do in relationships.  B:  And we're NOT in a relationship what do you call us then  N:  We're friends  B:  THAT'S NOT A RELATIONSHP!!?!  N:  Of course it is, but it's not a romantic relationship like Sabrina and Dan.  B:  So what, it's still a relationship and I'd like some goddamn appreciation for picking up your poo-stained sandals in my driveway, washing them off, and bringing them to work with me  N:  Wait. What?  I said that a lot last night >  B:  YOUR POO SANDALS! THE ONES YOU LEFT IN MY DRIVEWAY FOR ME TO CLEAN UP! Do you even care that I picked them up and cleaned them do you even care about the shoes  N:  Of course I don't care about the shoes, that's why I threw them out of my car when I drove away  B:  SEE! AND I WANT SOME GODDAMN APPRECIATION FOR THAT  At this point, we launched into a good 20 minute conversation about whether I cared about the poo sandals or if I was capable of caring about anything at all. Yeah, that was fun. Then, of course, it came back around to what was really bothering Becca.   B:  Look Neen, this isn't about us this is about Sabrina and Dan but since  you've  made it about us I want to know why you can't tell me you adore me.  I  adore  you  and I tell you practically every time I see you  N:  Yeah, and I hate it every time.  B:  What? Why? That's what people do in relationships. They tell each other how much they care about each other how much they like each other how much they adore each other.  N:  First of all, we're in a friendship not a relationship as most people intend it to mean. Second  and this is where I started to lose it >, WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS!? LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE!!? That's what people do who care about each other?! What world are you living in? Look, what you are seeking is emotional validation and I'm not playin' that. You want me to sit here and emotionally coddle you because you are insecure in our friendship. You overanalyze things and don't think I actually like you. Shit, you just said earlier that you think I only hang out with you when I have nothing better to do because you always ask me to do stuff before I get a chance to ask you  B:  Well? It's true isn't it before last Friday you never asked me to do something before I did. I can count on one hand the number of times just like I can count on one hand the number of times you've said something nice about me  N:  WHAT THE HELL IS THIS? A 7th GRADE PISSING CONTEST!? I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO KEEP SCORE WITH FRIENDS! I DIDN'T KNOW THAT SPENDING TIME WITH YOUR FRIENDS AND HAVING A GOOD TIME WASN'T A GOOD ENOUGH INDICATION THAT OH, I DON'T KNOW,   I FUCKING LIKE YOU AND THINK YOU ARE A COOL PERSON! JESUS FUCKING CHRIST!       This little outburts was followed by a lengthy silence. I don't know if Becca had just temporarily passed out or she was gathering herself inside her little foxhole of denial.   N:  I never have to deal with shit like this with my friends. We hang out because we want to. Unlike most women who actually can't fucking stand each other, we talk and do things because SURPRISE we actually like to spend time with each other. I have never told a single one of my friends that " I adore them" or that "I really like them." You know why? Because it's understood. Friendship is about actions. They know how I feel because we hang out. Because I am there for them when shit goes down. Because WE'RE GODDAMN FUCKING REAL LIFE FRIENDS  B:  Oh what, so now I'm not a friend see you said you don't have to put up with stuff like this with your friends implying that since you are putting up with it from me that I am not a friend   fucking attorneys >   N:  Pardon me for not using a fucking modifier at 12:45 in the morning and tired as hell. I don't have to deal with this with my   other   friends.   My   other   friends seem to be fine with how we conduct our friendships because everything's all good from where we're standing.  B:  Look, friendship is about doing things for each other. It's about sometimes doing something you don't want to do because they want it. It's about changing your diction because the other person likes it.  N:  Becca, friendship is distinctly NOT about those things. I am your friend in spite of those things I may not like or might want to change in an ideal world. Being your friend, I would never ask you to do something you didn't want to do. Shit, right now you are asking me to change how I conduct my friendships. I would never do that. I am going to be your friend in spite of realizing that I am going to have to deal with little drunken emotional outbursts like this from you. I understand that being your friend involves accepting the whole fucking package--the good  and  the bad. I recognize that there is a lot more good about you as it relates to our friendship that there is bad.  B:  No! No! No! As my friend if I tell you that every now and again I want you to tell me that you adore me because I like how it feels then you should as my friend do it not only should you do it but you should want to do it.  N:  Don't hold your breath. Becca what you are asking from me is to emotionally coddle you. Validate your role and presence in our relationship  B: NO I'M NOT!   N:  Yes you are, that's exactly what you are doing. You are unwilling to accept that like normal functional friends the fact that we spend a lot of time together and do stuff is a good enough indication that I like you and think you are a good person. That is not my problem. That's your own dysfunction and something that you'll have to deal with. I am going to conduct my friendships the way I always have and the way I do with my   other   friends. You can accept that or can't. I accept that you want me to change how I approach things and I am not going to ask you to change that. You just need to understand that you won't budge me. So this will be a source of conflict if and when it comes up again.  B:  I just don't see why you can't do this for me  N:  It's just not natural. It's not something I do. I don't spend time with my friends shooting the shit or drinking or doing shit and then say "I really like you Don. I think you're great." HOW FUCKING WEIRD IS THAT! Where do you go from there? What real purpose does it serve? It totally short-circuits normal conversation. I can't think of a single conversation I've had with a friend over the last 5 years where that kind of sentiment would fit naturally into the conversation.  B:  So what! It makes the other person feel good shows you're thinking about them that you care that you're HUMAN  N:  Normal conversation and interaction between friends is like a long tennis volley. Somebody kicks off the interaction--serves if you will. Every succeeding shot, while capable of being judged singularly on its merits, is affected and partially defined by the fact that it's a response to the previous one.  B:  Well I guess, but it would depend ultimately on whether it was being played on grass or clay...  N:  I'm done here  click at 1:10AM!!!>    So much for functional male-female platonic relationships. No more hook-ups for Becca. And I'm never answering my phone when I'm in bed ever again.

      Here's a glimpse at the stupid shit I did this weekend. I was sober for nearly all of these, so take that for what it's worth.  On Saturday morning I went to Urban Outfitters with a friend of mine who was looking to update his wardrobe. He left empty-handed because he didn't realize that "XL" at Urban Outfitters means "Tall Gangly Unshowered Emo-Kid" not "Large Angry Mammal." I, on the other hand, left with:  a pair of brown and orange Pumas  urlLink http://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shopping/product/alternateviews.jsp?iProductID=5048&count=0&amp;edpno=113983  and an 18" Red Velvet Jesus Piggybank  urlLink http://www.seantconrad.com/years/2002/pages/ab_bbq/ab_bbq46.jpg   As we headed back to my car, I held Red Velvet Jesus out in front of me with two hands and exhorted passers-by for change with the reminder that "Jesus Saves." No one got the joke... ___________________________________________________________________   I agreed to run the bar at a party some friends of mine were throwing Friday night. It was a pretty impressive setup, all things considered, so I had my hands full once the party really got going. By 1am everyone was hammered. Girls were making out, people were dancing to really bad Dancehall mixtapes, guys were wrestling on the grass. At some point near the end of the night, a girl who had earlier introduced herself to me as "Delightful" and had been making ridiculous amounts of eye contact with me every time I made her a drink over the course of the party came up to the bar and told me to lean forward so she could tell me something:  D: You look tense. Are you having at least a  little  fun? N: Sure, I'm having a good time D: You look tense, you should let me give you a massage N: Thanks, but I'm more of a giver than a taker when it comes to massages. My neck and shoulder and back muscles are generally always really tight as it is so I doubt it would really help. D: Well I wasn't planning on using my hands. N:  pausing confusedly. Thank you Vodka-Tonic > That's nice. But I promised Graham and Daniel I would tend bar and help them clean up. D: ......    " That's nice?"   WHAA?!?!   _____________________________________________________________    Before the party started, I walked down the hill with Daniel to get some dinner. Daniel is a 6'3" 350lbs Nigerian bouncer with Alopecia, dark DARK skin, and a ferocious appetite for all things Asian (food, women, clothes, anime, women). As we passed the computer science building, Daniel spotted a chewed up surfboard in the bushes that ring the building. He waded into the waist-high shrubbery, yanked out the board, threw it onto the pavement, and jumped up and down on it until the fins snapped off. He then placed the board in the middle of the street on what is a very steep hill, laid down on his belly--engulfing the surfboard in all his large, dark, Africanness--and said "Push."  Who am I to argue? Daniel-and-surfboard took off like a shot under the force of my right foot. They slid down on a relatively straight path and came to rest in the middle of the intersection at a 4-way stop. From the bottom of the hill a good 120yds away, we had this exchange:  D: That was awesome. Your turn N: Hell no D: Pussy N: Fuck You D: Your turn N: Fine  Daniel lumbered back up the hill surfboard in tow, positioned it in the middle of the street, and held it in place with his gigantic foot while he beckoned me over with a huge grin on his face. Reluctantly, I laid down on my stomach. Before I had a chance to really get settled and find my bearings he fucking launched me down the hill. Asshole.  Apparently, I found a better line down the impromptu street-luge track. I went sailing through the 4-way stop. As I made it into the intersection, I was abruptly turned askew by a well-placed manhole cover. It sent me careening shoulder-first into a moutain bike that was leaning against the storefront on the northwest corner of the 4-way stop. I came to rest at the 3 o'clock position flush with the bike and the front wall of the store. I rolled off the board to look at the bike. "U.C.P.D." Shit.  With my luck as good as it is, it should be no surprise that the rider of the offending bicycle--one Officer Diaz--was sitting mere feet away polishing off a slice of pizza and sipping from a can of Coke.  OD: What are you doing? N: Surfing? OD: Into my unit? N: Your unit? OD: My bike! N: Oh, I'm sorry. It was an accident. Totally my bad. OD: Are you drunk? N: Not yet. OD: Have you been drinking. N: No sir.  at this point Daniel comes trotting down the hill laughing > OD: And you expect me to believe you? N: Do you think I would have been able to stay on this fucking thing if I was drunk? OD: Watch your language sir. N: Sorry Officer.  Daniel's not laughing anymore. In fact, he is quietly inching his way into the convient store on the opposite corner of the intersection. Dick. > OD: Go. N: You want to give it a try? OD: Now. N: You sure? OD: Do you want to go to jail? N: Well, no. OD. Then go. Now. N: Yes sir....DANIEL! GET OUT HERE YOU BIG FUCKING PUSSY! ___________________________________________________________________   I am always amazed at how frantically people rush into the BART station when they hear a train coming overhead. It doesn't matter what time it is, what platform it's coming into, what direction it's coming from. They scurry mindlessly like rats to the train's Pied Piper.  This morning I was walking up to the El Cerrito Del Norte station next to a very pretty Filipino woman who had parked next to me. I struck up a light conversation with her as we walked. The conversation turned harmlessly flirtatious rather quickly. She was going into The City--like most everyone else--and actually worked just down the street from me.  We had exchanged names and were about to exchange phone numbers when the familiar low hum of a BART train came within earshot. I swear if this girl was a dog her ears and tail would have stood straight up. She even cocked her head in anxious recognition like Scooby when Velma tries to bribe him with a Scooby Snack. Before I could say anything she broke into a powerwalk, pushed her way through the turnstyles, and vaulted up the escalator.  I didn't do a thing. I just kept to my normal pace because I knew I'd see her in a couple minutes. How did I know that?  BECAUSE I COULD HEAR THAT THE TRAIN WAS COMING FROM THE OTHER FUCKING DIRECTION AND WAS HEADED TOWARD RICHMOND--NOT SAN FRANCISCO!  What's wrong with these people? Can't they recognize when something is coming from the south and not the north?  Well, I guess I have my answer.  Anyway, I found her on the platform a few minutes later still flushed from her sprint:  N: Why'd you take off like that? F: Didn't you hear the train coming? I didn't want to miss it in case it was the DalyCity Train. N: Yeah, I heard it coming. But it was coming from the wrong direction. F: Yeah but you only know that because the platform's still full and the Richmond train just left. N: No, I could tell by the sound. F: Really? How?   and this is where I--unintentionally--busted out quite possibly the greatest single litmus test for the intelligence of riders on a major metropolitan mass-transit system  > N: Jesus baby, haven't you ever heard of the Doppler Effect?!  Good work, NP. No lumpia for you.

      An old friend of mine from my first couple years in college flew into town Saturday night to attend a Sunday afternoon wedding just outside San Jose. I picked him up at the airport and within 90 seconds I wanted to open the door and kick him into oncoming traffic. How was I ever good friends with this guy? Let me ellaborate.  His name is Vijay. He came to Berkeley from India by way of Van Nuys and now works as a software programmer for a life insurance company. He lives just off Venice Beach down south and spends the majority of his free time--by his own admission--playing multi-player, first-person shooter computer games over the internet and avoiding anything resembling proper personal hygiene.  I had forgotton--thanks to a 2 1/2 year hiatus--how much Vijay talked and how full of shit he was. The first thing he said when he got in my car at the airport was "Man, great to see you. What a trip, brother. What's it been? 2, 3 years? Wow man, so much has changed. I can't believe I'm back in SF." (He  actually  said 'brother' and 'SF' in the same breath).  I was thinking to myself " Dude! It's the Bay Area. Nothing's fucking changed. Dude, YOU haven't changed. You're wearing the exact same fucking clothes you were wearing the last time I saw you--TWO FUCKING YEARS AGO--and you have the same long greasy hair and ridiculous Zorro-style facial hair!"  Instead, I nodded my head and plaintively grunted assent as I made like I was concentrating on maneuvering through airport traffic.  In case you were wondering, this was the first time I wanted to throw him from my moving car. It would not be the last.  At this point, though, I still wasn't really aware of how miserable my night was going to be. I got my first glimpse about an hour into the visit when Vijay implored me to call all of my friends that he knew because he "wanted to see as many people as possible while he was in town so he could shoot the shit and talk about old times." He said those exact words, I swear. So I called Don--one of my best friends.  N: Don. Hey what's up dude? What are you doing tonight? D: I don't know yet. It's A.J.s last night in town so we'll probably do something. N: Sweet. D: Is anything going on tonight? What are you up to? N: Well that's kind of why I called. I'm getting off the freeway to Berkeley right now. I just got back from the airport. I picked up Vijay. He's in town for a wedding and we're trying to see what people are up to. D: Vijay? Vijay who? N: Vijay. From the co-ops. D: HAHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHHHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHA N: You guys want to get together a little later for drinks? Shoot the shit. Talk about old times. D:  long pause > HAHHAHHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHHAHHAHHAHHA  .  After a round of similar calls, Vijay mentioned that he wanted to have dinner with another friend of his named David. This was the second time I wanted to kick him into traffic. David is a short, fat, red-headed computer programmer. He's half Iranian and quite possibly the most annoying person in the 510 are code. He has more hair on his back than on any other part of his body--COMBINED--and has made it clear to everyone he knows that he prefers anal sex to any other sort of sexual contact.  The prospect of dinner with Vijay and David should have had me fleeing the scene like a parole violator in a COPS episode. Instead I said sure and headed with Vijay--WHO STILL HADN'T SHUT THE FUCK UP--to an Indian restaurant. Dinner lasted an unmerciful 90 minutes with Vijay and David volleying computer-programming anecdotes back and forth in an attempt to one-up each other as to who has a tougher job and lives a more stultifyingly boring existence.  They tossed around words like "firewall" and "DLL" and "database management" and "sysadmin" with nerdful giddiness. At one point David actually spit a mouthful of tika masala halfway across the table in a fit of laughter after Vijay told him about somebody at his office patching the wrong something or other during a "standard fix" and then running something or other and bringing the whole system down. As they knowingly laughed the laugh of computer nerds, I seriously contemplated stabbing myself in the leg repeatedly with my curry-stained fork just to prove to myself that I was, in fact, still alive.  After the computer talk stopped, Vijay started holding forth on what it takes to be "successful in the real world." What it takes to "prove to everyone that you can do the 9-5 thing." How he has devised a plan to go to grad school, "be an entrepenuer by the age of 30" because he "can't work like this for much longer." If he's going to work for a company that's not his own, it has to be "by [his] rules." He is looking for a new programming job because he wants to be making twice as much as he is now in 3 years and he wants to "continue to grow professionally because [he's] really stagnating in his current position and not having his skill set being used to its full potential."  That was enough.   "DUDE! Vijay. You are so full of shit. Do you hear yourself? You have no idea what you're talking about. Where'd you come up with this shit. I feel like I'm listening to someone audition for the role of Gordon Gecko in a high-school production of Wall Street: The Musical. "REAL WORLD?!" What do you call the last 26 years of your life? FUCKING CANDYLAND?! Dude, you talk about how awesome L.A. is and how happy you are, but all you've done tonight is talk about Venice Beach girls you would never talk to because you're a fucking chicken shit and because you spend all day playing fucking computer games. You love your work but you are quitting and trolling your friends for job opportunities. You love your social life and the free-wheeling nature of L.A. women, but you couldn't name a single great club in the Basin and you haven't been laid since your whore of a girlfriend broke up with you--DURING THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION! DUDE, you're a nice guy and you mean well, but you need to get fucking real. Give me a call when you wake up, get a clue and cut the fucking bullshit."   I slid out of the booth, threw back the rest of a now-flat bottle of Taj Mahal beer, and left. After I bailed, I made my way to a party at my old house intent on getting those three hours of my life back. At the party, Vijay's words started to worm their way into my brain.  I should be writing full time. I shouldn't be wiling away my mid-20s busting my ass doing mindless work for a bunch of fucking attorneys.   As I got drunker some of Vijay's words started ringing truer. I refused to let this happen. I started thinking about friends I went to school with and I broached the subject with friends at the party:  N: Anthony, do you feel like you're not going anywhere? A: Yeah. N: Really? Why? A: Well Sara took my car keys before I left the house. Bong rip? N: No dude, not like that. I mean like with your life. Do you think you're not going anywhere? A:  pause>  Bong rip? N: No, dude. I don't smoke. A: Nothing? Not even pot? N: Nope. A: Ever? N: Ever. A: Really? N: Yeah dude. Answer my question. What  are  you doing for work now? Are you still looking? A: Nilsio man, I am dating a HOT Iranian girl who loves me and my cock. I'm playing in a band that I'm writing the lyrics for, and I'm driving a car that I won off my brother in a Euro Cup bet. N: Nilsio? A: Yeah dude, it's your new name. N: I have enough names. So what about work? I mean you've broken up and rejoined your band once already . What about work? A: I'm working at a butcher shop. N: A butcher shop? A: Yeah dude, it's good honest work. N: Like Brady Bunch Sam the Butcher, butcher shop? A: Yeah dude, it's awesome. I sliced bacon yesterday. I work like 3 blocks from my house. I go home for lunch everyday, smoke a j, jerk off, listen to some music, eat a bowl of cereal, and walk back to work. N: Dude, that's sweet. A: I know man, that's my I'm not trippin about "purpose" or "career path" or shit like that. Bong rip? N: No dude, I don't smoke. A: Oh yeah.  Then I thought about my buddy Dave. I would have called him but it was a Saturday night--his day off from the field camp he's attending in Montana as part of his requirements for graduating Berkeley with a degree in Geology. I remember he was planning on going fly-fishing that day. Dave's on the 9-year plan. He got to Cal in '95. I don't think he's done more than two semesters in a row. But, he's lived in Austin, Portugal, Antibes, Sevilla, and Tucson. He's been engaged twice, he parties like he invented it and, in talking to him in the past, it is clear that he has zero regrets.  Finally at 12:30am, completely drunk, I called my buddy CV. In Portugal. He runs a bar in Lagos and spends the entire summer either behind the bar or on the beach. Surprisingly, he answered:  N: CV, what's up man? CV: I just got in. Got e-tarded at Bahia Bar. N: How's life? CV: Dude, I'm a bartender in a Portuguese tourist town. N: Dumb question CV: Yeah. N: Tell me something, I had dinner with Vijay tonight. He got to tal-- CV: Vijay? Vijay from Cloyne? N: Yeah. CV: HAHAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH N: He got to talking-- CV: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA N: Shut the fuck up. So do you feel like you've got purpose in your life? Do you feel like you're wasting valuable time in your life? Like wasting your youth? CV: Wasting my youth? I RUN A BAR IN A PORTUGUESE BEACH TOWN. Dude are you serious? Did you call me at 8:30 in the morning to ask me that? N: Well yeah. I mean, what about graduating? The future? CV: Nils, since I left Berkeley a couple years ago my penis has had so many different women visit it, I should start stamping their passports. N: But what about your future? I mean after Portgual. CV: You better be drunk. N: Well... CV:  click >    Now I remember why these guys are my friends. I'm such a fag.

       This whole post is inspired by an email exchange I just had with a good friend of mine. Here's the email I sent:   -----Original Message----- From: Parker, Nils A.   To: Katie   Sent: Fri Aug 06 13:43:03 2004 Subject: RE: Blog I haven't cried in a long long time, but this actually brought tears to my eyes. I had completely forgotten about this:  urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/94   ___________________________________________________________________  I was just reading Jeff Merron's Page2 article about Olympic Bests and Worsts on ESPN.com ( urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=merron/040804 ) and he brought up something I had completely forgotten: The Derek Redmond Story ( urlLink http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/espn25/story?page=moments/94 ).   If you don't remember it, Redmond was an English track phenom who at the age of 19 clobbered the British 400-meter record but was forced to withdraw from the 1988 Seoul Games due to an Achilles Tendon injury. He qualified with ease for the '92 Games in Barthhhhelona and was heavily favored to win Gold ( You can read all this in the second link by the way, but I'm going to recount it anyway because it's therapeutic ) when, in his semi-final heat, he tore his right hamstring.   Before the curve onto the homestretch--about 200 meters from the line--his hammy gave out and he crumbled to the ground. Medical staff rushed to him with a stretcher and wanted to shuttle him off like they do in soccer matches. Redmond wanted no part of it. He wanted to finish the race. He got to his feet and started hop-hobbling down the track. Television being television, they had two camera angles on the whole scene: one a wide shot showing the whole track and part of the infield, and another a tight close-up showing every excruciating detail of the pain and the tears that, at this point, have covered his face.   Then, out of nowhere, his father comes racing down from near the top of the stadium (which has an amazing view of the entire city if you ever find yourself in Barthhhhhelona), leaps over the railing, darts past security, runs onto the track, and puts his son's arm around his neck to help him down the track. Both of them are in tears at this point. The crowd is roaring and cheering. The racers who were long since done are standing at the finish line clapping. As they near the finish line--the applause and cheers crescendoing--Redmond's father lets him go so he can cross the line on his own...finishing the race like he had earlier promised his father and himself.  ...  I was 13. My parents' divorce went final earlier that summer and I remember watching the heat on Sportscenter. Like every four years, NBC fucking butchered their Ameri-centric Olympic "coverage" by airing softly-lit 8 minute bio pieces on every single American competitor who either has a shot at a medal or has overcome some sort of obstacle instead of, oh I don't know,  ACTUAL FUCKING OLYMPIC EVENTS!!  As such, the heat either wasn't on or I just plain missed it that afternoon.   I don't know why, but I watched the whole race unfold standing in front of the television in the family room. The Sportscenter anchors weren't really narrating the clip I remember, they just sort of let it tell its own story. I remember standing there transfixed, my mouth slightly open, and tears streaming down my face. Everything about it reduced me to a frozen, mute well-spring of tears.  I'm not a crier. I haven't cried in a long, long time. In fact, I wasn't even a crier when I was a baby. My mom says that when I was really little (if that's even possible) when I wanted something I would just scream. She says I still haven't stopped with that either. Regardless, when she saw the tears coming down my face it scared the hell out of her. She started rushing back and forth between the family room and the bathroom, returning each time with a different item from the medicine cabinet.  Finally, through the tears, I had to stop her. "MOM! What am I going to do with Vick's VapoRub and a box of butterfly bandages!? I'm crying! I don't have LUPUS!" That settled her down ultimately, but not before she went into the kitchen and made me a grilled cheese sandwich. HUH!?  Anyway, when I came across this story today it brought tears to my eyes again. I sent the link to my mom as well and reminded her of that day. As traumatizing as that moment was for her, I think she looks back on it periodically for reassurance that her son does, in fact, have a soul. Who'd of thought?  And before the comments come in on this entry, yeah I choked up remembering this incident. Yeah, I'm 25. Yeah, I'm male. So what. Fuck you!

      These two entries are things I wrote about a year ago but ring absolutely true when it comes to misadventures on the BART system.  Some of you might remember them: _____________________________________________________________________   Walking to the BART station one morning I crossed the path of a little kid--probably 9 or 10 years old--on his way to school.  He was wearing one of those big puffy NorthFace jackets and a pair of old-school Jordans.  I tried to get his attention so I could find out where he got his shoes, but he didn't hear me.  I thought he was ignoring me until I got closer and realized he was listening to an iPod through high-end Sony studio headphones and eating an Extreme Sausage Sandwich from the Jack in the Box across the street.  I have never been more envious of a 9 year old black child in my entire life.  Now I understand why people get mugged for their clothing. ____________________________________________________________________    When it rains BART stinks, literally.  One rainy day last October was no exception.  As I boarded the front car at Embarcadero I was struck, once again, by the oh-so-familiar "wet-BART" smell that will, to varying degrees, saturate the entire train by the time it reaches its destination.  The odor, I have found, is a combination of wet clothes, uncomfortable human body heat, and the ethnically-flavored, gastrointestinal discharge of the passengers on board.  It can be overwhelming to those who lack the capacity to breathe through their mouths.  Eventually we pull into 12th St. where we are met by the typical rush-hour crush of riders transferring from the Pittsburg-Bay Point train who were too goddamn impatient to wait the extra 7 minutes for the Richmond train they ACTUALLY wanted to board in the first place.  It is a particularly heavy commute day, so every available seat and much of the standing room is taken as we depart the station with a jerk.  Being so crowded, I decide to look up from my newspaper to see what the cat dragged in.  Sitting across from me is a woman--I think--who, upon examination, can only be described as functionally retarded.  Under her over-stuffed backpack and clear, rain-soaked poncho, she is wearing a lime-green Teletubbies sweatshirt.  It does not fit well.  To accompany this trend-setting fashion statement, she is wearing a pair of pocketless maroon sweatpants that she has tucked neatly into a pair of fully-extended gray sweatsocks.  The socks, in turn, are wedged into a beat-up pair of knock-off Teva sandals.  I'm telling you, this woman is a sexy beast.  The best part of this woman's ensemble is what she decided to wear on her head.  Oh no, not a hat.  Not a scarf.  She's decided to use the Style Section of the Tribune as her protective cover.  In case you need some help with this image, let me tell you, the irony is delicious.  Even better though, is the fact that she refuses to take it off her head while she is on the train.  At one point it starts sliding off and she actually repositions it atop her head.  If this isn't enough, it seems our "special" friend has the sniffles.  She has to blow her nose constantly--at least once every minute.  I don't take much notice at first, but after Snot-Rocket 14, I make the mistake of looking up from my paper and trying to figure out what her problem is.  As I crane my head upward she brings her hand up to her nose for Snot-Rocket 15.  I cannot believe what I am witnessing. She is blowing her nose into her bare-hand!  This isn’t just some dainty, excuse-me, pseudo-sneeze either.  This is a monster, SARS-laden, mucus missile. I almost threw up on myself.    At this point, if you are a normal human being, you should be saying to yourself, 'Wow, this couldn't get much worse.'  Unfortunately, you would be wrong. So very, very wrong.  Upon blowing bio-hazard all over her palm and fingers, our "special" friend decides to examine the evidence and, once she is satisfied with the results, wipe it down the front of her poncho--her CLEAR poncho.  I am absolutely speechless--revolted beyond description  It takes everything I have not to stare directly at her with the disdainful look of a PETA protestor at a fox hunt.  To avoid making eye contact with her, I begin looking around the car.  To my surprise, everyone in the vicinity is watching her.  And, like me, they all have looks of horror and disgust painted on their faces.  I couldn't tell you what any of them are thinking, but I assure you the thoughts are NOT pleasant.  I spend the rest of the ride fighting my gag reflex and wearily awaiting the next snot salvo.  Fortunately for everyone, when we arrive at Ashby station in Berkeley she gets up, collects herself, and bids a hasty retreat from the car.  The doors close and instantaneously the front half of the car explodes in a chorus of "Omigod's" and "What the hell's?"   There is a phenomenon in human psychology through which survivors of the same major traumatic event develop intense, life-long bonds similar to those felt by members of a normal nuclear family.  Friendships, adoptions, even marriages have been born from these associations.  I dare say, we are no different.  When we see each other on the train, we share a knowing glance and a disturbing chuckle.  Our "special" friend has scarred us for life…and no one can take that away from us

      Yesterday morning I sat across from a Mexican guy wearing a purple and black flannel work shirt and a mullet. He had a small igloo cooler between his legs and a Starbucks messenger bag slung over his back (CAN YOU SAY "FREEBIE"!). He had rings on every finger save his thumbs and he was listening to music on an ancient SONY Walkman. He rocked awkwardly with the beat (which you could hear faintly over the din of the moving train) and tried pitifully to lip-sync with the lyrics. I'm pretty sure he was listening to Mexican rap because the only word he could mouth consistently was "PUTO!" _____________________________________________________________________    Here's a tip for anyone stuck standing on a crowded BART train on their commute home: don't stare unblinkingly at the person 16 inches away from your face even if he looks like a cross between Adam Arkin and Larry David with a tan. It's even more wise not to stare at him if he has 8 rings through the hard cartilage of each ear. It's even  wiser  not to stare at him if he has hair  GROWING DOWN THE TOP RIDGE OF EACH EARLOBE THAT COMES VERY NEAR TO MESHING WITH THE THATCH OF HAIR SPROUTING FROM  INSIDE  EACH EAR THAT ITSELF BLENDS INTO THE HUGE MUTTON CHOPS HE'S SPORTING!!   I could tell he was getting pissed because I never said anything; I only stared intently at his left ear from above the newspaper I was reading. I'm just glad we didn't get off at the same stop. He probably would have tried to kick my ass and that was a prospect I was genuinely afraid of. I'm sorry, I don't care how big you are, when someone with that much body hair gets angry with you, it's time to make yourself scarce ___________________________________________________________________    Conversation is rare on BART. So when it happens everyone is listening. The people around you may be reading their newspapers intently, or knitting feverishly, or dozing contentedly, but they're listening. They're ALL listening. That's why flirting on BART is so difficult...unless you don't give a shit like a co-worker of mine. Then it becomes HIGH-larious.  Quite often I ride home on the same train as this co-worker. Her name is Tandy and she is one of the bigger jokers in the paralegal department. She's the type of girl who talks about her bowel movements like she would talk about the weather just because she knows how uncomfortable it makes the people around her.  One the rare occassion that we find two seats together on the same car, this girl flips the switch and launches into some sort of inappropriate conversation. The first time we rode together and she started in like this, the topic of choice was 9/11 and the likelihood that it was all faked--like the moon landing and the Holocaust. Her best line that night was "I don't know why people find this so hard to believe. David Copperfield makes shit disappear all the time. All he needs are some mirrors and an orchestral accompaniment."  Back near the end of June we ended up riding home on a very warm Tuesday night. We sat down and as soon as the train pulled away from the station she started flirting with me. As best I can remember, this is how the conversation went before we were interrupted by her cell phone ringing:  T: What's your name again? N: Nils. Sorry, what's yours? I'm bad with names the first time I hear them. T: It's Tandy. Like Candy, but with a T instead of a K. N:  pause trying not to laugh already > Interesting name. Were your parents into electronics? T: No.  loooong pause > N: It's just that Tandy is the name of an old electronics company that became Radio Shack a few years back. T: What's Radio Shack? N: You've never heard of Radio Shack? Where are you from? T: Well I just moved to California a few months ago so there are certain things I'm still learning. N: Oh well that makes sense I guess. Where'd you move from? T: Los Angeles. N: You do realize that Los Angeles is like the biggest city  in  California? T: No, not  that  Los Angeles. I'm from the Los Angeles down by San Diego. So have you ever had sex on a train because I haven't although I've had sex on a boat, a plane, in a car, on a motorcycle but it wasn't moving so that doesn't count I guess, ummm, oh on a moped but that wasn't moving either so I guess that doesn't count too N: Actually I'm a virgin. T: WHAT!? WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU!? N: I'm Catholic. T: Ohhhh, so you can't have normal sex but I can still put it in your ass right? N: Excuse me?! T: Yeah, aren't Catholics the ones who have tons of oral and anal sex because it's not normal sex and not a sin? I read about that somewhere. N: DUDE! That's Catholic  girls  NOT Catholic  guys.  T: Oh.  cell phone rings >   I rue the day that we commute home next to each other uninterrupted. I'm afraid she's going to turn me into a hate crime victim.

      I have made numerous mistakes on my trips to Las Vegas.  I’ve given a “dancer” my room key.  I’ve rubber-cemented the room furniture to the ceiling.  I’ve been in a screaming match over the number of drinks I was allowed to have at the blackjack table at one time (The answer is one and it will not change if you call the pitboss a failure at life).  Those little missteps, however, pale in comparison to the biggest mistake I ever made:  driving.  DO NOT DRIVE TO LAS VEGAS.   I cannot emphasize this enough.  My first trip was for Super Bowl Weekend when I was 22.  Five of us—me, CV, Will, Dave, and A.J.—jammed ourselves into Will’s crap-ass Chevy Lumina and left late Friday night. The whole drive was a certifiable disaster but Will took the cake.  While CV did his Michael Andretti impression down I-5, Will played DJ in the front seat chortling along with every damn song. The only thing more painful than his singing was the torrent of Guinness and Jack in the Box farts that seeped from his ass like a natural hot spring.  His farts had me questioning all that was holy and true in this world.  They smelled so bad that, at one point, they actually woke up A.J.  A.J. slept through the Northridge earthquake in 1991, but Will’s farts jerked him out of his sleep like they were his own personal gastro-intestinal reveille.   We pulled into the Luxor parking lot at 7a.m. defeated men. Fatigued, sober, and drenched in Will’s ass-perfume, we wanted nothing more than a shower and a bed.  We missed the entire Saturday recovering from the drive! Never again. Kids, don’t make the same mistakes we made. Learn from them and fly. It’s the only way. ___________________________________________________________________    Las Vegas is a mecca for celebrities during titlefight weekends.  I can't really explain it, but for some reason famous people flock to the desert when they find out that a couple of bruising heavyweights or a pair of feuding, wiry Mexicans are preparing to beat the ever-loving crap out of each other.  During those weekends, the casino floors of the better hotels are an orgy of celebrity, ridiculously hot women, and small groups of drunken friends who call each other by idiotic nicknames while they blow their winnings on hard-way bets at the craps table. I, of course, am perpetually a member of that third group.  There are three things you need to do if you want to maximize your celebrity sightings:  1. Stay at the hotel that is hosting the fight (usually Caesars, MGM, or Mandalay)--if the fight is at Thomas & Mack stay at one of the top tier hotels 2. Don't play the cheap tables.  I promise you Shaq and Adam Sandler aren't playing the $5 tables at the San Remo.  3. Follow the hot chicks.  When you're on the casino floor spot the groups of disgustingly hot women.  They have celebrity radar.  Their senses are keener than truffle pigs.  It's truly amazing, trust me on this one.  Following this holy trinity of fight weekend rules, I have bumped into, seen, and played cards with quite a few celebrities--from the guy who played Rafter Man in Full Metal Jacket to Roy Jones Jr.  My favorite run-in was at the MGM right after the De La Hoya-Vargas fight.  I was playing $100 hands of blackjack with a bunch of random people who were neither famous nor hot. I had just returned from the bathroom where I think I took a leak next to Owen Wilson…or was it Luke? I don't know, who cares? As I sat back down, something caught my eye. Maybe it was the gaggle of grandparents shrouded in a fog of Preparation-H fumes that was passing by.  Maybe it was that low murmur that floats through a crowd when someone sees a famous person. Or, maybe it was this man's deep, bronze tan and perfectly coiffed silver pompadour that produced a glowing aura like the corona surrounding the baby Jesus.  Regardless, I did what came naturally. I stood up and shouted:  "Oh hell yes! Tony Curtis, SWEET! Hey Tony!  T-Money!  T-Curtis! Antoninus! What's up, baby?! What's up singer of songs? I juggle too!"  My Heineken-fueled greeting was met with silence. From EVERYONE.  Tony Curtis froze in his tracks and scanned the tables until his eyes fell upon me standing on the footrest of my chair, blathering incoherently, and gesticulating wildly.  He stood there for a couple seconds just sort of staring at me. I was sure he was going to have me ejected from the premises.  Instead, that familiar look of fear and disgust I have encountered throughout my life melted from his brilliantly-tanned face and was replaced with a smile and a wink as he gave me the classic halfwave-to-thumb-and-forefinger-sixshooter greeting.   It was AWESOME! T-Curtis and I had a moment. I was the king of the blackjack table. For 20 minutes.  Until I lost all my money doubling down on 12 (twice) and all my blackjack-playing privileges for spilling my beer all over the place (again).  I'm not very bright.

      We'll call her Linda. Because Linda is a fat girl's name. She works in an office doing some type of administrative or clerical work, but she is NOT a secretary. Ohhh, nooooo. She's an executive administrative assistant or an Accounts Receivable Supervisor. Linda wears blouses and skirts that hang just below the knee. She does not wear them because they are feminine or sexy. Rather, she wears them because they belonged to her older sister and she is too cheap to update her wardrobe.  The icing on the outfit-cake is the leggings with white athletic socks and white Reeboks. The leggings are typically black--because everyone knows black leggings with white socks and sneakers peeking out from underneath an outfit from the  first  Bush administration is SUPER SEXY! I, for one, find nothing more erotic than seeing a woman dressed like a bloated Border Collie.  Sometimes, though, the leggings are tan. The packaging calls them "nude," but you and I both know there is NO way Linda's legs look like THAT when she is--uggh--naked. We all know her legs are long bulbous tubes of bleu cheese; a pale, pasty white streaked with bluish/purplish veins snaking their way up toward her blubbery gut.  Linda works from 8:30 to 5 everyday and takes an hour for lunch at EXACTLY noon because that is when the rest of the overweight Lindas go to lunch. Linda also commutes on BART. If she walks to the station, she takes the same route. If she drives, she parks in the same spot. To buffett herself from the chill of Bay Area mornings, she wears a long puffy coat (usually grey, brown, or pink) that looks like it came out of the wardrobe room off the set of the first season of  Roseanne .  She comes armed with a tote bag and an unwieldy purse that, without fail, she fights with every morning trying to find her ticket  The tote bag is Linda's magic satchel. Given to her at any one of many Secret Santa gift exchanges, the Tote Bag is a light beige in color and procured by the gift-giver free of charge with a purchase of $20 or more at a local Barnes & Noble. It replaces her old black tote bag that had the words "Tote" and "Bag" actually written in rainbow-lettering diagonally across both sides.  Linda's job is not important and she never brings work home, so there are only a few things she can put in the magic tote bag. First, of course, is her lunch. Lunch is leftovers from dinner the night before. It is crammed efficiently into Glad reusable food-storage containers--the poor man's Tupperware. Next is any combination of knitting, kids' fieldtrip permission slips, and Danielle Steele novels. The purse AND the tote bag are quite burdensome, the carrying of which exhausts Linda before the day has truly begun. Linda is trash.  The essence of Linda doesn't really shine through, though, until her commute home. Like Cinderalla at midnight or the Hulk when he gets angry, Linda turns into an unstoppable commuting manchine at the stroke of 5pm. If anyone ever bothered to timed her, I'm pretty confident she could set a world-record in power-walking for the trip from her secretarial carrel to the BART station platform two blocks from her office. She bobs, she weaves, she ignores traffic signals and oncoming traffic. She will not be deterred from catching the 5:09 Fremont train ( authors note: all Lindas live in Fremont because that is where fat trash lives ).  Once she gets to the BART station and has positioned herself in her usual spot at the very end of the platform, the Commute Game truly begins. She counts how many people are standing in front of her poised to board the same train--some are familiar faces who she can reliably count in or out. It is the random-face factor that concerns her most. How many of these assholes know the rules? she wonders to herself. Do they know that they should be lined up on the right-hand side of the black platform tiles? Do they know that they can't just sit down on a bench and hope to slide in wherever?  Linda comes up with a tentative number of passengers in front of her who will board the Fremont train. At 5:08:30, the train roars in, the last car easing to a stop at her spot on the platform. Linda quickly counts the number of empty seats in her car and makes a split-second calculation as to which way-left or right-she should turn once she enters the car. I've heard of military operations conducted with less precision and calculation.  If there are more than 4 people in line ahead of her, Linda turns into Ben Wallace once she enters the car. She's got her knees bent and her cumbersome bags hung at the elbow to help her box out. She's not above using a well-placed totebag-elbow to get past a less decisive commuter. I've even seen Linda cut the corner on a quadrapalegic and use the wheelchair as a screen. I was at once disgusted and impressed.  Why does Linda put so much effort into her commute home? you might ask. To get a seat. Pure and simple...to get a seat. Nevermind that she just  SAT DOWN FOR EIGHT GODDAMN HOURS!  Oh no, she's tired. It's been a long day in front of the computer watching her vericose veins spread and her IKEA shelf-shaped ass widen just a little further. She needs to take a load off. I don't know about you, but it seems to me that it wouldn't hurt Linda to, oh I don't know,  STAND FOR ONCE IN HER GODDAMN LIFE!   Maybe I'm being unreasonable. And, to be honest, for a second I thought that might actually be the case. Then yesterday evening happened. Linda was sitting in the seats immediately to the left of the entrance to the train car. It is generally understood--thanks to the NUMEROUS signs stating as such--that these seats are to be surrendered to the elderly and the disabled if such a person were to board that car. Well, these are Linda's favorite seats because they are right next to the doors and allow her to exit before everyone else and beat them through the turnstyles down inside the station.  Yesterday evening, we pulled into 12th Street Station and a blind man entered our car. I didn't notice him until he boarded but Linda spotted him as soon as he came into view on the platform. This is all part of her Seat-Strategy. There are 8 seats by each door dedicated to elderly and disabled passengers. During commute hours, all these seats are typically filled. Linda's strategy is to identify as soon as possible if any such person is going to board her car and then quickly bury her head in her knitting or her Danielle Steele novel so as to feign that she didn't notice said person upon their entrance. Yesterday was no different. The only problem was that two of the eight seats were filled by people who were asleep, three others had elderly Asian women, and one seated a mother with a stroller. This left two seats filled by people who should have, without a second thought, surrendered their seats to the blind man who was, at this point, desperately groping his way toward a place to sit down. I stood to offer the blind man my seat at the rear of the car but another passenger closer to him came up and guided him by the elbow to his seat.  Well, if Linda had orchestrated it to make the other person in the handicapped seats get up by feigning concentration on something else, why might you ask did the other person not get up? I wondered the same thing. When my stop came and I rose to leave, I realized why.  IT WAS ANOTHER FUCKING LINDA!  As I walked past them and toward the door I told them in my outside-voice that they were not very nice people. I believe the words  pathetic , and  slothful , and  hideously-dressed  might have been used. They looked up at me in horror like I had just told them I took a dump in their totebags. Whatever.  I hope they get hit by a bus.

      I flew back to San Francisco today. I asked one of the secretaries at my office to book me a flight out of Newark through D.C. that would get me home at a reasonable time. What does she give me? A 6:25 am departure out of Newark arriving 25 minutes before my connecting flight. Thanks bitch. This meant I had to leave at 5am. I stepped out the front door and was met with humidity that had already crept past 70%--perfect for wool slacks and a thick cotton dress shirt. I am dumb.  Adding to the comfort level of my trip home was a packed 60-seat plane the size of a Plymouth Voyager. If the Nazis had passenger jets in 1941, they would have used the plane I was on to transport the Jews to the concentration camps. We were crammed in that damn plane like our last names ended in "-stein." I hadn't been that uncomfortable since I was awoken by a New York City police officer asking me why I was throwing liquor bottles and seat cushions out of a moving RV.  I was one of the lucky ones, though. I had an aisle seat! That meant only my entire left arm was jutting out into the aisle and only my entire right leg was jammed into the seat in front of me. Space was so tight that I had to type this like I had flipper-arms, with my elbows attached to my sternum. I was a sexy manimal.  If that wasn't bad enough, our departure was also delayed by 20 minutes. There were two people to blame for this added bonus: some skinny douchebag in a knockoff Armani suit and a fat half-breed with a trombone. I can't fault the skinny douchebag too much, however. His secretary called him as he boarded to inform him that his connecting flight was canceled and there were no other flights going to his destination through Dulles today. What I can fault him for, though, is standing stalk still in the middle of the fucking aisle while taking his phone call. It's not like the plane didn't already feel like we were all bits of meat fighting for position inside a sausage-casing. I honestly didn't even notice the traffic jam he was causing until someone behind me yelled, " HEY SEACREST! SITDOWN OR GET OFF THE FUCKING PLANE!" God bless sweaty angry Italian women.  The half-breed was truly to blame for our extra "together-time" on the ground. At 6'3" and 300+ lbs, this guy was probably half black, half Guamanian. I could tell he was Guamanian because he smelled like salami...don't ask me, man. It's not my fault pacific islanders love processed smoked meats. Half-Breed looked like he could be Adam Duritz' older brother. In a certain light though, he looked like the bastard son of a black man in the Air Force who lost a bar bet and went hoggin.'  He sported long, braided black hair that hung down to his ass and Fu-Man-Chu moustache-goatee combo a la Tank Abbott. He wore TIGHT brown shorts, top-sider deck shoes, a gold Hawaiian shirt, and a large gold chain with attached gold conch shell. This Guamanian nightmare was a P-I-M-P...until he decided to bring a fucking trombone onto this Plymouth Voyager with wings.  If you've ever been on a small jet you know that the overhead bins are remarkably narrow--so narrow, in fact, that they preclude the secure storage of, oh, I don't know...maybe  A FUCKING TROMBONE!  Well Manila Gorilla insisted it should fit because it fit on his last flight-- A 777 FROM LONDON!!  I was so stunned by this Grand Canyon-sized leap of logic that I couldn't speak. I was unaware that people this dumb did not die in childbirth. The flight attendant, of course, told him she would have to check it for him and, naturally, he refused. This little dance of the morons was what really added twenty minutes to Auschwitz Airlines flight 1939.  I now officially hate Guam. I am going to make it my life's work to eradicate the "Pacific Islander" bubble from all standardized forms. You delay my flight, I erase your cultural and ethnic identity. Fucker ___________________________________________________________________    Power walking through Dulles to get to my connecting gate, I crossed the path of a father and son in full Boy Scout uniform. I probably wouldn't have noticed them--or at least found the scene somewhat endearing--had the son not been  at least  18 and didn't have a slightly modified Hitler-stache... EXACTLY LIKE HIS FATHER!  The father was carrying a Boy Scout backpack over one shoulder and the son was sporting all his merit badges. I'm sorry, but 7:30am on a Tuesday is too early for that much unintentional funny.  I tried to walk past quietly on the way to my gate. I failed. Luckily I was walking next to a guy who saw exactly what I did. I turned to ask him a question. LOUDLY:      "Hey dude, I didn't know the annual NAMBLA convention was held in D.C.?"

      I've been spending the last few days with my cousins up in north Jersey.  Because of work, I haven't seen them in almost two years so I was caught by surprise with how much bigger and more articulate and more savvy all of them were.  There are three girls: Christen (almost 11), Lauren (9), and Ellen (4).  I was there when Christen was born back in '93 so we have kind of a special bond.  Lauren is the super smart one, so I always test her on things. She hasn't been wrong yet.  And Ellen is my goddaughter--so I get to spoil her whenever I'm around.  Over the last three days, these girls have said some of the funniest, truest shit I have ever heard.  Here's a sampling:  --we were all in the pool on Saturday afternoon doing flips and handstands.  I did a handstand and when I came up from under water Ellen, the 4 year old, yelled at the top of her lungs:           Neeny-boy, you have a super-duper gigantic monster weiner!
