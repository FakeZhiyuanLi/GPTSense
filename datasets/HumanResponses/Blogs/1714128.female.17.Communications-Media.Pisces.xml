       Attack of the Dots   Ok ok I couldn't help it.  I mean there was all this talk of these amazing new templates that blogger has published.  At first I was all like, "Mine is better than anything they could make."  But no, I humbled myself and picked one.  The one with dots.  Cool dots.  Not to be mistaken with Dots the candy.  Ewww.  So lets see, It's been a while.  You know what that means.  I have stories to tell.  Woo woo.  The Doctor Visit So I had to get my ears flushed.  You might think to yourself, why?  Well you see I have ridiculously small ear canals so the ear wax gets stuck in there impairing my hearing.  So what happens is that they take this huge syringe thing with a rubber tip on the end and they stick it in my ear while full of water.  Then they let all the water go into my ear and it circles around behind the ear wax and slowly bulids up pressure to send it out.  The first time i had it doe it took about 6 syringes and all was fine.  Well this time after about the 3rd syringe I could feel it moving.  The "physicians asst." went to go fill to syringe up and next thing I know, I'm on the floor.  I didn't even know I was falling.  Odd? yes.  You see it affeted my equilibrium and therefore ripping me of any sense of balance.  It was so wierd.  I was like an out of body experience.  I know that the majority of you who read this have heard the live telling.  But i had to tell it again.  It was awesome.  The English Notes So english is famously boring.  Like put you to sleep boring.  And thats what I do.  I spend the entire class struggling to stay awake.  My eyes are usually half shut.  I'm nodding off.  I'm sure it's hilarious to watch.  But it's horrible.  I live in fear because once last semester I feel asleep in the front row mind you and Maley came over and grabbed me and sat me up straight and yelled.  It was traumatizing.  So to avoid that I take notes that no one can read because I can't see them because I keep going cross eyed because I'm SO tired and my eyes are shutting.  So one day last week it was really bad.  I was falling alseep.  Well much to my surprise I let myself go and did fall asleep.  For how long?  I don't know.  But i do know that I wrote down on my notes what I was dreaming.  Something about "wild toilets."  Yes, no kidding.  I can show you.  I wish I would have remember that dream.  Sounds exciting.  The Run in with the Cops So post-working on Friday night I decided to hang out with Jake for a while to celebrate him making it through his first night of work.  We went and got Whataburger (a love that we share, which is odd because most people hate it, but we're awesome) and then we went to the park to eat it (parks being another common bond.)  So we're sitting around eating our Whataburger when suddenly we are both blinded by this horrific light.  Then we see headlights through the spotlight.  Then a car.  Then those infamous rubber bumpers.  Oh my, it was a cop.  The conversing went a little something like this: Cop: What do you think you're doing? Jake: Sitting? Cop: Do you think you should be? Me: Are we not allowed to sit in a park?  Cop: The park's closed. Me: I didn't know parks closed.  For future reference could you tell me when a PUBLIC park might close? Cop: Well uh 11:30.  Maybe 11. Me: Hmm..ok? Cop: GATHER YOUER THINGS AND LEAVE  Yea I was trite.  I mean come on where does it say you can't sit in a park after 11.  HOW DO YOU CLOSE A PUBLIC PARK?  I mean it's a big space.  A public space.  I was ranting for a good 20 minutes afterwards.  Anyways it was amusing.  I couldn't help but think, what if I were there with a boyfriend and we were going at it?  What would happen then?  That would be scandelous.  An even better story than this.  We can only hope I'll tell that story some day.  Well I think thats all for today.  I'll be updating more regularly.  Last week was just crazy busy.  I apologize.  I'm truly sorry.  Please Comment more.  It gives me more reason to blog.  That way I know people are reading and that I'm not just wasting my time.  Time is precious.  Maybe even money.  Oh I'm Vice President of The Teenage Republicans now.    Movie Quote of the Day: This is to honor the release of Shrek 2 which was amazing.  Go see it now: This is from the first Shrek by the way Shrek: Ogres are like onions.  Donkey: They stink?  Shrek: Yes. No.  Donkey: Oh, they make you cry.  Shrek: No.  Donkey: Oh, you leave em out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.  Shrek: NO. Layers. Onions have layers. Ogres have layers. Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers.  [sighs]  Donkey: Oh, you both have layers. Oh. You know, not everybody like onions.   To all the Republicans: Goodbye To all the Democrats:  Go Play in Traffic

      Crystal The Informant:  I'm just letting you know that I will not be updating on weekends.  This is a business and I'd like to think it's a successful one SO I will be closed for business on Saturday and Sunday.  I'm just telling you because I don't want you to think that I'm pulling a Jake with my blog already.  Fear not my good friends.  The only thing you have to fear is fear itself  Aha. ha.  Wow.  That is all.  If you need entertainment since most people don't feel like updating lately I would check out the daily (and sometime more than daily) rantings and enlightenment of  urlLink Casey Ford .  I'm sure you'll enjoy it.  ~Crystal Out

       Shhh....Ugoff needs Silence.   Well I have just witnessed the end of a great thing.  I knew all those people.  They were my friends.  Ha. Get It?  Wow.  I need a life.  Ok.  Well I didn't cry.  I almost did.  It was surprisingly happy and thanks to Chandlers comedic relief, funny.  I'm happy with the way it ended.  Thats how it should be.  And awesomely enough my favorite character is Joey and lucky me he's doing a spin off.  So I'm not left with nothing.  I have something to hold on to and look forward to.  Yay.  Wasn't that a fuzzy moment?  Let's take a moment and Awwww....  I'm still devestated by is ending.  I mean come on, Thursday nights will never be the same.  The only time that I have ever been this saddened by a series ending was when Sex and the City ended followed closely by Seinfeld.  I mean Sex and the City and Friends in one year.  WHAT ARE THEY DOING TO ME?  Next thing you know they will be ending Everybody Loves Raymond.  That'd be the icing on the cake.  I might lose it if that were to happen in the near future.    An honorable mention into this season of finales is the series finale of Frasier.  While I was not a obsessive viewer in the past 11 years I have seen my fair share of episodes and grown to love Frasier.  Justin is going to be devestated.  Thats one of his top shows.  And with all the TV he watches you know that it has to be good to be in the top.  OK well I hope that you have gained as much from this blogging experience that I have.  This was special.  Don't expect these warm fuzzy moments often.  It's not everyday that your favorite TV show ends forever. *sniff*  This is Crystal Out  Ok I lied.  As a last note, Did anyone else just LOVE that Burger King commercial.  That Ugoff guy, classic.  I quoted it in the title thing and in my profile.  Shh.. Ugoff needs silence.  Burger King bows to Ugoff.  Sexy.  You know they paid a record $2 Million per 30 seconds for commericals during this festivitiy.  I'm really done now.  Goodnight Friends (that has a duel meaning).  hee.

       Free Lorenzi...   Well it's been an interesting past couple days.  Wednesday I had part one of my IB Psychology Exam.  It was nice.  I slept till 3rd hour.  Got up.  Ate a hearty breakfast for my "brain food" and then arrived in style @ lunch.  The test was as I expected.  Difficult and I won't bore you with the details since most of you don't take Psych and would skim through this paragraph wondering what the hell Reductionism is.  Because yes there was a question on it and I didn't know.  The first words out of my mouth upon leaving the teachers cafeteria were " WHAT THE HELL IS REDUCTIONISM?" only to be bombarded with a plethora of "OH I KNOW."  It was an experience to say the least.  I'm not looking forward to next years exams.  Thats for sure.  So you and I are in the same boat since both of us are baffled by reductionism.  Since i talked about it after saying that I wouldn't.  I don't feel bad.  I don't.  Other than the IB torture chamber last night was the season finale of the OC.  It was sad.  I'm happy she kept the baby.  I wanted her to.  I'm pro-life for the record.  It may have screwed things up, but it was necessary.  I didn't cry.  Does that make me inhuman?  I guess maybe I'm just not as attached as everyone else.  Or I'm not a cry baby.   I most likely will cry tonight though.  It's tragic.  Series finale of Friends.  I'll probably post afterwards because I'll either be so happy with the ending and sad that it ended or upset with the ending and sad that it ended.  Either way it will be an emotional blogging experience.  I mean I've been watching this show since I was 7.  Thats 10 years.  Thats more than half of my life.  This is HUGE.  Can you tell?  I wore my PJ's to school today in honor of part 2 of the IB Psych exam.  This was a much more plesurable experience.  I opened the exam book and looked at the first question and I smiled.  Then I giggled.  That might have been distracting but wow it was so easy.  I was thrilled.  The rest of the day was insignificant with the exception of a run in with school securiry.  Dun dun dun....  You see the dead woman walking (Jenna) and I were on our way to the restroom during Biology when we were stopped by the talking caution sign (he was gaurding a spill in the hallway) and given the 3rd degree.  This man was Mr. Reynolds.  Better known as the "attendance dream" in the past.  You may or may not remember that, but it sounded good in my head.  So he gets all tough, puffs out his chest and says "Why aren't you in class?  Where is your pass?"  So of course I laughed at him and he escorted us back to class where we were given the infamous CD pass.  How embarressing and yet amusing at the same time.  It was the highlight of my day. I just can't take that man seriously.  It's funny because anytime that he does the announcements no one listens.  The same thing with Mr. Masterson.  I swear as soon as we hear those two easily recognizable and annoying voices everyone immediately tunes it out.  Well tunes it out even more than before.  It's no secret.  The annoucements aren't all that entertaining.  I like the video annoucements though.  They are usually a good display of horrible acting and the lack of intelligece among the student council.  Was that mean?  Ha.  In true blog form I have a quote of the day.  This won't be a consistent tradition but when something good presents itself I have no choice:  *I walk into Bio* Dominic McDevitt Parks:  Hey Crystal. Me: Huh?  Oh umm.  Hi. Yes? DMP: You know how Maley yelled at you for wearing PJ's to school today? (to clarify she looked at me like a bug and yelled "you wore Pajama's to school?!?!?") Me: *laughs* Yes.  Why? DMP: Well I wear them everyday.  Is that a bad thing? Me: Umm...well maybe fashion wise.  I dunno.  *laughs and runs back to desk*  That was the first time he had ever addressed me specifically.  I wonder how long he had been holding on to it for.  I mean English was 4th hour and Bio is 7th.  Anyways, it made me chuckle.  I'm also glad he realizes that he wears PJ's everyday and that maybe it's no so "hot" or "fashionable" and so on.  I was worried that maybe it was only me.  And the rest of IB.  He's an interesting character.  Let's see.  This blog has no order and is very unchronological.  Suck it up.  This is how I think.  And it's my blog.  Yesterday afterschool I took the Toxic Kid home with me.  We arrived and I saw the big gray van parked in the driveway.  You might be thinking, "Oh No, Your mom was home??"  No it wasn't quite that bad instead it meant that the invasion of the house cleaners (better known by me as Mexico) were there.  You see there are like 12 of them and they go like one to a room and I can't hide.  They are everywhere.  So Jake got to experience Mexico and the funny thing was they made him nervous.  Anyone want to venture a guess as to why?  No, it's not because it's racist.  No, it's because he felt bad making it seem like he had anything to do with the mess that they have to clean up in our house.  He wouldn't eat, drink, take off his shoes, lay on the couch, or basically do anything.  It made me chuckle because as  soon  as they left he kicked off his shoes and sprawled out on the couch and had a cheese crisp and diet coke.  Ah, what a kid.    In the latest news Lorenzi is gone forever.  Rest in peace buddy.  Despite the saddness of the situation he did achieve his goal.  That goal was to become a legend around the halls of North Canyon.  And I'll say he definately did that.  This blog entry is dedicated to him.  FREE LORENZI signs and stickers can be seen posted around the school although now that he is officially gone forever from the halls of North Canyon it might soon change to WHERE'S LORENZI?? upon his request.  He's an inspiration.  I will miss the 4 layers of clothing that don't match in any way shape or form every morning.    I think that about wraps it up for today.  There's about an hour left until the Friend's festivities begin.  I know I know, I can't wait.  I will blog again.  Afterwards because I'm obsessed with the show and with forcing my opinion on people.  Hee.  Movie Quote of the Day:  Today's quote comes from one of my favorite Disney Cartoons of all time.  Finding Nemo.  God I love this movie.  I shall explain that my favorite character is Jacques.  So this quote is all him.  He's awesome.     Gill: Jacques! No cleaning!  Jacques: I am ashamed.   Gurgle: He's from the ocean.  Jacques: Oo, la mer. Bon.  [Spins Nemo around as he cleans him]  Jacques: Voilá. He is clean. [Nemo is sleeping, Jacques throws many rocks onto him]  Nemo: ...uh... AH.  Jacques: Suivez-moi.  Nemo: [stares]  Jacques: Follow me.   Not even the french kids can make me as interested in French as Jacques does.  OUI.

       Wait, is it?  OH my, IT IS DT....   Hello all.  How are you feeling this fine evening?  Ok I lie, it's not fine.  In fact it's quite unnerving.  You see tomorrow is the BIG day.  I won't be going to school tomorrow because I wittingly convinced my mother to let me stay home for the morning till I am forced to enter the Hell that is the lecture hall.  I am so excited.  I get to sleep till past 10, on a school day AND I'M NOT SICK.  It's what is keeping me going right now.  Minus that joyful image and you have a ball of anxious nerves.  I'll keep you posted on how it goes.  I hear the physics kids were in for a real treat and an even bigger one tomorrow.  My apologies.  On a lighter and more fluffy note as shown in my Title I had a Daniel Thai spotting.  Thats right folks, I saw him outside of school with his mother and brother.  He was pushing the shopping cart for her, in Albertson's since thats where this miraculous moment took place.  It was adorable.  Can't you picture it?  Anyways it was Justin that first spotted him and then again Justin who wouldn't go up to him, but rather made me do it.  It went a little something like this:  *I sneak up behind him, get ready and them turn around and walk back to Justin* *Justin pushes me back into the DT force field* Me: Daniel? DT: *spins around horrified* Oh my! Me: Wow, I'm seeing you out of school.  This is odd.  You leave your house? DT: *Signature DT Glasses push up*  Why yes. Me: Can I get a handshake? DT: Ummm... *looks around frantically for someone, anyone he knows for fear of embarressment, you know I'm girl*  Sure  *shakes hands* Me: *laughs*  Are you renting a movie?  I thought you didn't watch movies. DT: NO, I'm filling out a Albertson's preferred Customer Card Application Me: Oh, Justin had one of those.  He's quite proud of it (up to this point you probably forgot Justin was there since he flew the coop on this adventure) DT: *Looks at Justin*  Uhhh, Justin Ienuso, right? JI: Yes.  *Laughs and proceeds to wave hand in the air for an appoaching story* Yea, I used my card today.  Saved a $1.50 on powerade and cashews. Awesome. Me: I'm not sure Daniel, did you say my name?  Do you even know me? DT: *laughs hysterically* YES, you are Crystal Pierce. *glasses push again* Me: *laughs* Awesome. DT: Yes well. Remember when they didn't have cards....*proceeds to explain the conspiracy and rip off of Albertson's* We all exchanged goodbyes and he scurried off to find his mom.  IT WAS SO AWESOME.  I WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IT FOREVER.  HE KNEW MY NAME AND I SAW HIM.  Ok I'm over it and you YOU ARE SO JEALOUS. Ha. Haha. Hahaha.  Hmm, then I went around trying to cash a tax refund check.  No luck.  Quite Boring.  Went to the library.  Boring as well.  Then went on an adventure with Matt MacDonald  Always a good time.  Today's included Wendy's and the library where he found a book on Black Hair Care for his english project.  Only him.  It had a lot of inpiration talking in it like:  Just think to yourself, "GIRL my hair can be clean and I can shampoo it and God gave me this hair and God doesn't make mistakes."  We had a good time reading it.  You can imagine.  We also went through some of my Huck Finn Book trying to read the Jim parts.  You should try it.  Hours of fun.  I then attended the North Canyon Orchestra Concert featuring all sorts of Rock music.  But more importantly the cello man himself, JUSTIN.  It was a good concert.  Jake was loud.  I dropped his camera.  He cried.  Ha.  Other than that we dropped a lot of stuff and made a lot of noise.  We may have been distracting.  BUT I had fun.  Thats all that matters, to me anyways.  Oh yes, Justin was amazing as usual on his pretty sound making piece of finishing wood.  That is all for tonight.  I best be going to bed.  Big day tomorrow.  Wish me luck, you know like the luck of the Irish.  Good Movie.   Movie Quote of the Day: This comes from the classic Sandlot.  You should recognize it and IF NOT same comment from yesterday applies.  This movie, like Happy Meals, is a rite of passage for children Phillips: You eat dog crap for breakfast, geek!  Ham Porter: You mix your Wheaties with your mama's toe jam!  Sandlot Kids: Yeah!  Phillips: You bob for apples in the toilet! And you like it!  Ham Porter: You play ball like a giiirrrrrrrrl!  [entire group stands in shocked silence]  Phillips: What did you say?  Ham Porter: You heard me.  Phillips: Tomorrow. Noon, at our field. Be there, buffalo-butt breath.  Ham Porter: Count on it, pee-drinking crap-face!   I want to be able to insult people like that one day.

       Man am I awesome...Crystal In the Box?  How original and yet unoriginal at same time.   So for the 5 of you who will actually read this relgiously (and I say that because I know that you will check it everyday and that if I don't update you will yell and scream and annoy me to death) I feel good about this one.  I have had 2 in the past.  There was Better Than Cleo which I'll be honest, flopped after like 2 months.  Then there was Old Habits Die Hard which lasted for like 2 days and I never even got the word out about.  But shhh...we are all about new beginnings and forgetting the past in MY BOX.  I will refer to this site as my box for it's like we are communicating in a box. Literally.  I crack myself up.  So today what did I do?  Well I went to school and while I'm sure I could bore you with the details of every minute of my crazy exciting IB life, I'll skip that.  Afterschool me and my pal Jake went to his house and played DDR.  For those of you who see sunlight one every 50 days when you actually leave your computer, that is Dance Dance Revolution.  I'll tell you, it's a revolution all right.  (I'm feeling an Orange County reference here.  Jack Black is awesome. "let's get naked and start a revolution!")  Quite the addicting game.  I've played it on 2 occasions and I'm hooked.  I may not be good.  In fact I may look like I'm doing an Irish Jig, badly, most of the time.  But I try and I will say I am improving.  I'm actually learning that the patch of space in the center is not an option.  You should never stand there unless of course you are selecting which crazy song you will be dancing to.  Sometimes people like Jake don't have a board (or pad) that actually works. *cough*  That makes it a bit difficult.  Jakes pad couldn't handle the heavy flow of dancing, if you know what I mean.  No? Just me.  OK then.  Moving on.  I came home and thought to myself, "I should study for psych."  Yes, my IB psych exam is this wed and thurs.  You can imagine my excitement.  Well I decided that I didn't really want to study.  SO I went to the TV.  I hoped that maybe nothing would be on so I would be forced to study because I had nothing better to do.  But no.  Office Space was on.  Damn it feels good to be a gangster.  If you've never seen it, I recommend it.  Alex Muir lives by it.  You may remember the whole beanie protest.  I am quite certain that movie inspired such antics.  I personally love it.  Of course I Love almost every movie.  You will notice that I will reference this in this box quite often.  In fact I feel a movie quote of the day coming on.  God I'm awesome.  I feel as though I have said enough for one day.  I'm sure that I'll come back in a few hours and add.  Because I'm OCD like that and I'll think about something that would be good in here.    Movie Quote of the Day: Since I have spoken about the greatness that is Office Space here is a quote by my favorite character Milton, played by the Amazing Steven Root.     Milton : And yes, I won't be leaving a tip, 'cause I could... I could shut this place down. Sir? I'll take my traveler's checks to a competing resort. I could write a letter to your nation's board of tourism and I could have this place condemned. I could put... I could put... strychnine in the guacamole. There was salt on the glass, BIG grains of salt.   That may have been wasted on you if you have never seen in which case GOOD because you don't deserve to live you stupid piece of sheltered kumquat.  That is all.  I've been working on my template and I've made steady progress.  I want my old one back but sadly I don't know where it went.  So instead of crying I'm making due.  I don't know what the codes are for all of the colors, like say yellow.  You know my favorite.  If someone could help me out that'd be swell.  And for you who helps me I would retract the Kumquat statement from your general direction
