      Another day in the life of me. boring as ever, with the slight interruption of a cinema visit with Mikey and cycling around Hyde park. Another day to chat to George and wonder why were not together when we both *claim to* love eachother. Another day to dread the ever closer day when I get told of my failings.  I wonder if chatting to George is really such a good idea. The initial idea was that I still wanted to be there for him as a friend, as I do really love him and I know he could really use a friend who cares about him like I do and knows him as well as I do. It seemed so simple, just let the wounds heal and keep in touch as friends. Now it seems I'm just aggravating the wound without even giving it half a chance to heal. Like the old cliche of a scab that you cant stop picking although you know it only makes the wound take longer to heal. I keep needing to 'pick the scab', or in plainer terms I keep needing to call George.  should I cling on to memories of what 'we had' - or at least what I thought we had? Or should I just call it a day and get a big bandage to cover the whole thing. I mean I know that I could put it all out of my mind and focus on writing my personal statement or college work in a few weeks *shudder*. The problem is I don't REALLY want to let the wound heal. If it heals then things are really over. At the moment there is still a small hope that somehow things will change and I will get him back. This seems stupid after all he's put me through, especially as I cant even trust him in the slightest anymore. But as they say, love is blind I guess......  can people really change? Or are we trapped in our 'selves' forever? Are we bound to our fate regardless of our will to change? Or is it just that George doesn't really want to change?  personally I think that people can change, but only if they want to - not if someone else wants them to. I think that my disapproval of Georges behavior has very little influence in his chances of changing. I believe that the only way George will ever change is if he really believes what he does is wrong. Sadly, at the moment I don't think that he does believe this. I think any desire to change will be driven by the thought of getting me back, rather than being driven by the belief that his behavior is unacceptable.  so the question remains. Does chatting to him help? True it makes me feel better at the time, but it does just prolong the hurt and drag up all my emotions again. Its like I have the worst of both worlds. I don't get to feel loved and to hug him and tell him I love him, but I still feel sick when I find out he's chatting up girls or went to the cinema with some whore.  I think the only way I'm going to stay sane it to either take him back or to cut him out of my life completely. However I don't think I could really take either of these options. He lied too much and hurt me too much for me to take him back without any guarantee of change, and I love him too much to let him go. on the bright side, I think sanity is highly over rated anyway.

      Ok.... another day to sit around and relax, blissfully unaware of what's to come on Thursday. Its got to the stage where I don't think I even want to know my results anymore. At the moment I feel ok saying to myself that the worst I can possibly get is ABCD, but really i guess it could be much worse, and they are sure to be a far cry from my AAA grades last year.  I guess I'm lucky as I can re-take next year, but the thought of going back to college having failed fills me with dread. I don't think I could face my teachers ever again if I have failed. However, part of me questions why I care so much. I wasn't brought up to think that education is the most important thing in life, in fact I was told almost the opposite. Nether the less, here I am worrying about my results.  people are constantly told that 'education is the way forward', and I do agree with this statement. However, that is not to say that school is 'the way forward'. There are plenty of ways of learning without going to school. Schools focus on teaching children to be quiet and obedient, not to constantly question their surroundings. The national curriculum is now includes subjects which have little relevance to everyday life, and all lessons are taught to meet 'assessment criteria' rather than the needs of individuals.  What happened to learning being practical and fun? What happened to learning for learning sake? Now it seems that knowledge without a grade to justify it is dismissed as useless. I think that school just teaches people that learning is about competing and is a means to an end, not that learning should be fun and embraced as something that enriches your life.  I hope that I will be happy with what I have learned at college, regardless of what grade an examiner stamps on my work at the end of it all. sadly I fear this will not be the case.

      Ok.... Here goes my first entry...... Don't know what to write and have been asking around for inspiration - the general consensus is I should write bollocks, so that's what I will do. Anyone who has ANYTHING remotely interesting to do leave now.  I guess if your still reading then you are as bored as I am.....  I don't know what to say really, I'm feeling alone and bored and missing George like crazy. I mean, why is it that I still want to be with someone who repeatedly lied to me and cheated on me with a 15-year-old? I'm I that sad or desperate that I believe that's all I'm worth? or is George 'the one' who I'm destined to live out my days with? Although id love this to be the case, sadly I think its highly unlikely.  Surely I'm young and meant to want to go out and have fun, not want a 'serious' relationship. Surely I'm going to spend my whole life regretting not being less uptight and boring in my youth. I mean these are meant to be the best years of my life and all I seem to be doing is thinking about the future, or moping about the past. Maybe I don't want to be a teenager at all, maybe I want to be some middle-aged woman with all the security that comes with having lived out more than half your life. Or maybe I should just get a grip and start being what I am rather than dreaming about things that are not going to happen in years - if at all.  So, how exactly do you 'act like a teenager'? I've spent the best part of my life trying to be 'grown up' and am always "The responsible one" who my mother looks to for advice. Maybe being 'responsible' is my vocation, and I am destined to spend my whole life worrying about other people and advising my mother on another problem that life has thrown at her.  I mean what is it to 'act like a teenager' anyway? Should start being 'wild', moody, taking drugs and going out to squat parties every weekend and taking the week to recover from it all? Should I wear nike trainers, my hair scramped back and wear a permanent scowl whilst shouting abuse at random people on the street? Should I dye my hair black and conform to a strict dress code of black and dayglow in am attempt to be non-conformist? I don't know, but if that's what it is to be a teenager, I think I'l give it a miss.  I'm quite happy with radio 4 waking me up every morning, knitting with my granny and knowing that I don't care if I wear designer clothes or whatever. I may not go out all the time and socialize with sad druggy weirdos, but at least when I do go to parties a have a really good time hanging out with my good friends who are lovely and fun to hang out with. anyway enough pointless rambling, night night all xx
