       urlLink Red Sox Trade Nomar to Cubs (ESPN)   Well, it's official: Nomar Garciaparra, the face of the franchise for almost a decade, has been traded. Just minutes before the trade deadline, it was announced that the 31-year-old shortstop would be sent to Chicago in a four-team deal that brought back Orlando Cabrera and Doug Mientkiewicz. Cabrera will become the new starting shortstop, while Mientkiewicz will most likely platoon at first base with Kevin Millar. The odd men out will presumably be David McCarty and Ricky Gutierrez (once Pokey's back from the DL).  Defense was the plan here: Both Cabrera and Mientkiewicz are Golden Glove winners, and Theo had referred to the Sox defensive play as their "fatal flaw". The question is, can this defensive upgrade offset the loss of Nomar's bat? Neither acquisition is hitting well this year, although Mintkiewicz is known more for his defense, and Cabrera has been forced to dwell in baseball purgatory out in Montreal without Vlad Guerrero batting behind him. Cabrera's bat should wake up amongst the superior Boston lineup. Another plus to Orlando is that he is remarkably rugged, having played in all but two games last season, and every game so far this year. For a fan base that has always worried about Nomar's wrist and Nomar's achilles tendon, this should be a breath of fresh air. Like Nomar, he is unsigned for next year, but unlike Nomar, we have no reason to believe he would refuse an extension.  Another player the Sox dealt for is outfielder Dave Roberts from the Dodgers. Roberts is a good fielder with great speed, who has already stolen 33 bases this season and is capable of 40-50 bags a year. His bat is weak, and offensively he only really offers his speed. With Damon, Reese, and Roberts in the lineup, Terry Francona will have to abandon his Moneyball strategies and let them run. Fenway Park should be a dangerous place for opponents if we let these speedsters loose on the basepaths.  Losing Nomar is difficult, and I will definitely miss him. He was the best shortstop this team has ever had, and one of its best all-around players. From his incredible rookie year, to his flashy defense in the '99 ALCS, to his .372 batting average in 2000, "Nomah" will be sorely missed. This deal looks very good for next year since we were going to lose Nomar anyway, but it remains to be seen what it will bring us in 2004. We did not address our pitching concerns, and that is going to come back to haunt us. I would have preferred trading Nomar for a top starter like Clement, and taken my chances with Pokey, Ricky, and Horns at shortstop. The addition of Terry Adams will help the pen to some extent, but I have always seen pitching as integral to making a playoff run, because you can never have too much of it. Hopefully, our defensive additions can minimize our pitching woes.  Feel free to post about the trade, about the playoff picture, or the legacy of Nomar Garciaparra. I for one will miss him, and I wish him all the best in the South Side. Touch 'em all, #5.

       urlLink David Boston Out For Season (Yahoo! Sports)    This is unbelievable. While the Dolphins are still reeling from Ricky Williams's surprise retirement, star receiver David Boston has injured a ligament in his knee and will most likely miss the 2004 season. What initially looked like a strained patellar tendon has become something much more serious. This leaves Chris Chambers, who recently resigned for five years at $30 million, as their primary offensive thread. Yeah, it's that bad. To add insult to injury, Williams has said that he'd like to come back and play for the Raiders. Ouch.  Looks like the AFC East just got a little easier for the Pats. Let's just hope the Patrick Ewing Theory will not be applied to the Dolphins: it's a known fact that teams who lose their star(s) to injury or free agency can band together and play even better. The Pats (Bledsoe in 2000) are a great example of that, but this Dolphins team has proven listless year after year, no matter who they put on the field. Speaking of the Patriots: Hurry up and get this season started! I need to forget about these Red Sox.

       urlLink LA Gets Mihm, Banks, Atkins in Deal (ESPN)    urlLink Simmons: The Glove Fits (ESPN Page 2)    For those of you who haven't heard yet, Danny Ainge has dropped another bombshell: trading Marcus Banks, Chris Mihm, Chucky Atkins, and a 2005 second-round pick to the Lakers for Gary Payton, Rick Fox, and a conditional first-round pick. Not only  is The Glove coming to Boston, but Rick Fox, former Celtics captain, is coming back.  Payton probably only has a year left; Fox may retire before the season starts; Atkins and his contract are gone. This means that the Celtics will be back under the salary cap. Also, no matter where the Lakers finish, an extra first-round pick will do nicely, even if it's lottery-protected. Al Jefferson and Delonte West have shown that they can start, and Banks, who was once Ainge's golden child, has not lived up to expectations, so he's gone. This will be a much more exciting team than last year, and it should also fare better in the playoffs. Furthermore, they're still building for the future with their excellent draft. Ricky Davis will probably be the next to go: it's no secret that Ainge got him for his  tradable contract.  The Lakers get a backup center/power forward in Mihm, a younger backcourt, and a replacement for Fisher. This trade makes me think Mitch Kupchak is throwing in the towel out there. For a defending conference champion, this team is going downhill fast. Payton may not be happy about leaving the west coast, but it looks like he's going to a team that's headed in the right direction.

       urlLink It Was Time For Him To Go (Boston Globe)   The above link is a scathing article that Dan Shaughnessy wrote about Nomar. It's unlike him to take the team's side; I was expecting him to attack the organization and the Brain Trust like he did after the botched A-Rod trade. I certainly don't take the redheaded stepchild's word as gospel, but if what he's saying is true, then it really was time for Nomar to go.  It's no secret that Nomar hasn't been happy in Boston this year because of the A-Rod debacle, but Shaughnessy poses that he's been miserably here for some time. To think that after tying up the ALDS against Oakland that he would be sitting dejectedly by himself and complaining, that just blows my mind. According to Dan Roche, Theo approached Nomar yesterday and told him that they might be trading him to Chicago, and asked him how he's feeling. Nomar, who had been hinting he might need to return to the DL soon, allegedly told Epstein he'd be healthy if he were traded. That raises some questions.  From one Nomar fan who's sad to see him go, I just hope that's an exagerration. But on the other hand, if he did hate it here so much, that should make this pill easier to swallow.
