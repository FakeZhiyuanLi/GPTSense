      I don't like pessimism. I don't like goths. I can barely stand skaters or preps. I hate cliques. These things depress me, and I don't think anyone deserves that. I think that in the end I want to be alone. I just want everyone and everything to disappear, even for only a split-second, just so I can know what it really means to be alone: to be surrounded by nothingness and to be empty.                                             ...I hope that death is nothingness.

      Thursday, June 24, 2004 11:32 pm- My first entry  It all starts somewhere. "This" is in my parent's basement, sipping on a bottle of IBC root beer, lightly giggling at Colin Quinn's Tough Crowd. This is life for me; mellow and sweet. Hard to believe that I want to leave this and will be in about eleven months. Everything seems to be shorter when placed into months "Hey Bob! When're you getting married?" "Twenty-seven months." "Wow, that close?" My point is proven. My plan Is simple: move up to Royal Oak, Michigan. Once there, enroll in class es at the local community campus (i.e. Oakland Communikty College) and launch my entertainment carreer. Sounds easy, but is probably nigh impossible. I can't think of anything more to write. What an annoyance. I make this damn blogger so I can share my feelings but none of my feelings ever come up! What a fucking pain.

      I wrote about being afraid to talk to N______, but I didn't understand WHY I was afraid...until I turned on the TV. I only had to watch one second of television to see why I couldn't speak to her. How am I supposed to have confidence when no one will help me on the most important form of communication that has ever existed? I've seen movies where the underdog succeeds, but it's only by a stroke of luck. How can a real underdog succeed when he's being dogged?

      I had a dream last night. "She" was in it. I've had a crush on her since school, and I was hoping to lose it during the summer, but it turns out my dreams don't want me too. This is just getting rediculous. Why am I, Adam Garrick Lee Giovanni Otti Ston, in love with ANYONE?!?!?! I've been asked out by many and turned down each one, but the only one that matters I don't even have the courage to even THINK OF? I have to talk to her: not about it, but I just have to see her. I wish I could just hate everyone and get it over with, but for some reason I need them all.

      I look at people who walk down the street and question how they can remain so happy, so false, so faithful. I turn my gazes inward and see my friends and close ones and they are in "love". Love shows me how much "god" hates us. There is no emotion so complicating, so crippiling, so completely maddening as love; people die for it, people beg for it, not realizing the bitter truth of it: Love isn't Tangible. I haven't experienced love as of yet, but I know better than anyone in the world that love isn't something that you can get from the tavern or your bestfriend, you have to have it within you at all times. It's there, you just need o find out where. But even if this is true, why am I so lost?

      So I did my usual monday ritual: I went donw to Woodward, got dinner (spaghetti in olive oil and garlic, delicious), then went to the Planet Ant Theatre in Hamtramck. Planet Ant is the best Improv Comedy Theatre in Detroit (even before Second City left to Novi) and I'm proud to say that I was there this special evening. The opening team was "Dave's Kidz", a group of improvisers composed from the classes that are held there every Saturday (I go to those, too!). They're an OK group, they do a lot of "Whise Line is it Anyway" stuff, but they pull it off creatively. The final game that they played that night was "Questions", where you can only communicate through questions. The leader of the group and a female player were on tghe stage, when they asked for a location for the scene to take place. I screamed "IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET!" They took that idea and the female player intiated. "What the hell are you doing in the street?" she said. Then, the most amazing thing I've ever seen occured. The leader dropped to one knee and proposed...in the middle of the imaginary street...........PROPOSED! AS IN MARRIAGE! My heart stops (as I'm sure her's did) and squeeled in glee as she said "Yes". The house team's whole schtick that night was about marraige.  On my drive home, I couldn't help but giggle like a retard witha drumstick (the ice cream, not the instrument) and I got to thinking, "Will that ever happen to me?" Will I ever do that? Golly...It was...amazing...you have to see it to believe it.
