       as my day slowly comes to a end, i look at the empty bottle of Canada Dry...in a way, that bottle resembles me...  I wake up to the sound of my enemy's voices, also known as, my father and brother.  I lay in bed for a while thinking about the night before in which i got blown off by a rich girl and was slightly hurt, but managed to pull through by riding my bike around in the rain, it always seems to help.  I wont go into detail about the mushy mushy girl crap right now because i took my mind off of it last night and would like to keep it that way.  I climb out of bed, well role, but im out of bed by 10:30 i think.  I get some waffles and start my day on the comp listening to Duality by Slip Knot, not usualll the choice of music i start my day with, but it worked.  Today was a sunday, so that means my brother paintballed today, it got him out of my life for those few hours of paradise, which abruptly came to an end like everything else good lately...  As the day progressed i managed to put on some socks and shoes and head outside, i figured i would go to this tree that i was planning on building a tree fort in...got fucked over there...  The storm that happened a few nights ago managed to blow off a giant limb and move the tree so much it sank into a sink hole...15 or 20 feet deep...so now the tree that i was planning on climbing...is slanted and 20 feet shorter.  I think it will keep sinking...things i have encountered today have seem to be relfrections of my mood.  Today was very odd, one of those freaky days when you expect to get sucked into another demension and start an epic quest for answers...   The day progressed and i got lazier, watched some tv then decided to remake my failed blog that i attempted a few days ago...  But for now, i return to the Canada Dry, empty and still.  I have to go attempt some homework now, which is a bitch, i hate leaving it to the last minute...im out for now...  *Beamed up by Scottie*

       You know that wonderful cup of joy that contains root beer and vanilla ice cream(and sometimes hershey chocolate syrup)?   What do you call it?  Root Beer float...or Black Cow?  Im starting to think that no one else calls them Black Cows and that it is just a Killermann thing (my family)...but if you can say otherwise...you better...

       I was hoping for my first post to be happy or cheerful, not straight out brother bashing, which is what it is going to end up being...im pissed now...see, what happened was: I used to be friends with my brother, well i wouldnt go that far, he treated me like shit, i was nice to him, but now he has crossed the line...You know how its the youngest kid that is the tattle tale?...not in my family.  My brother walks over to me while i am on the comp...and asks me what my CookBook file is, he knew what it was, because ever fucking prep hears these things and repeats them to sound cool...It is an Anarchy Cookbook.  He then runs to my dad (take into account he is 17) and says "Dad, dad, zak has a anarchist cookbook, zak has an anarchist cookbook."...know that this would set my dad off...which really makes no sense(concitering he HATES George Dubja and the government)...but he starts snapping...but in my family no one is persistant like i...so when they looked away, i simply moved it to another file and Hide it...Idiots i live with, Idiots...

       after school and all that shit, what am i to do?   Ive concitered taking a part in the world of Psycology and be a Psychatrist (maybe i should learn to spell it first...) and im really leaning towards that right now.  I figured if all else fails i can be a corrupted cop...  yeah, the corrupted cop who blows things up, knows martial arts and is a master sword fighter...oh yeah, and likes music:O  but then agian, i always thought about being a good cop...damn, so many fall back careers...i want to either be a Criminal Justice Major...or a Psycatrist...what do you think?

       well, its obvisouly the second and its about 5:43...    Today was alright, had tons of those mixed feeling things but now im sittin here in some sweat pants waiting for my clothe to wash and dry.  You want to hear about my day?...sure hope so, caus im telling you anyway...  Woke up bout 5 times last night, mind couldnt comprehend what the eyes saw each time, so i eventually fell back asleep.  Got out of bed 2 minutes to late agian, but thankfuilly my alarm clock is set 9 minutes head...so i has 7 minutes till the bus came.  Did the good 'ol smell and wear technique, used by guys all over the world.  If you do now know what that is, tsk tsk tsk.  Put on those clothes and scrambled for some dreaded socks, which i have to wear now caus the fucking pool got shut down so i cant swim in gym anymore, so i need socks.  Finally make it out of the door and complete my daily jog to the bus stop/aka/the end of my long drive way. Bus comes, after i finish picking up the recycling the fucking racoons torn everywhere.  Get on the bus, thats always the same, same seat same station same mood...dead.  Bus gets me to school, thats all i care.  WE MADE IT TO SCHOOL!:)...ha ha ha.  As im walking through the fucking church door entrance looking main doorway, whoever designed it is fucked up.  Make a dirty face and flash the Rock On hand sign to the camera as usual...bastards.  I'll skip telling you about english, caus it sucked, were reading Juliet and Romeo, and ive learned one thing over the course of reading this book. Be More Observant!...you will understand sooner or later.  Gym sucked caus we played softball, with like 20 kids on each team, i would have rather ran the mile...anyways...3rd hour German! WOO, i did my homework this time, but Herr Ruth called on me alot more than usual, he doesnt trust me when i say Ja, to doing my homework:(    4th hour biology, ill say this, I love you man, Who wants chipperiffics?  Lunch was alright, one of my good friends, who also happens to be my Jewish Brother, Justin...told this kick ass story that he was making up on the spot for like 15 minutes and had us all laughing our asses off...whew!:) After lunch, the class right after, is always a drag, its a bald man who has a super ego and makes corny jokes...and on top of that teaches Geography...WTF?  So i read my book in that class, whew Reading! whew SPIRITWALKER! 7th hour happens to be ONE of my liked classes, not for the class, but because of the people...but its math, so they kindof cancel eachother out:) 8th hour i only like for the following reasons: Its the last hour of the day, and its keyboarding class, the stupidest class ever, every kid knows how to type now, its so lame. Got home and did some stuff for my dad, got 20 bucks out of him...yet he still owes me 200...hmm So we skip ahead a little while end up where we are now, with me sitting here in some sweat pants...yeah...just sweat pants and socks typing this long post which right before i post it it will probaly get deleted something...QUICK...*copy's writing*

       Well ive discovered to relive the old better days of the Ninja or Samarai time, you have to be either rich, or have a gun...  Im slowly making my way there, learning martial arts, ordering a sword, but it isnt the same, what has happened?  Where have the days gone when instead of shooting someone you battle it out with hand crafted unique blades of steel using your muscles and skills to win...not the pull of a trigger.    If anyone has a damn time machine, you better hook me up.    I do admit now a days isnt so bad, but in the ways in which i wish things are, now a days sucks ass.  We have technology, oh whop de do, fuck that shit.  I would gladly trade everything i have to go back, to the times of the old.  People these days are so fucking stuck on materialistic shit they dont even know the meaning of life....

       dé·jà vu- The illusion of having already experienced something actually being experienced for the first time.  I experience that...all the fucking time, and it is really starting to fuck with/worry me.  Having it with daily experiences is normal to me now, but just a day or so ago...i had it while playing Ninja Guiden, and that fucked my head up...   I have dreams, and these dreams are like reality to me, then i forget about them for a while, then i experience that exact same thing (same time, same place, same situation) sooner or later.  My brain flashes and i remember the situation, and i think im dreaming...then i "wake up"...but not from sleep.  When this happens to a person more than often...for me lets say...atleast once a day, it really fucks with ya.  Studies have proven (and all the researchers believe that) the "mind" is not centrally located in the brain, it is made up throughout the whole body, it is affected by physically and mental things.  Have you ever thought about when your reading a book, that you can actually hear yourself reading?  Well take that to the next level and while reading picture yourself reading the book without breaking your concentration.  Now stop reading this and go pick yourself up a copy of SPIRITWALKER by Hank somethin...ask me for more details.  If you know what the Shamans are and what they could accomplish...your on the right track...

       no, not the kick ass Blink-182 (old blink, not the new crappy COMPLETELY mushy mushy shitty blink.) song.  Today is the 12th and i hvae to post a new post to update this shizzle.  My computer seems to have been over taken with spyware, the ones i really like are the ones that open the CD tray for you, i mean how convenient, i always find some way to benefit from it, so ive been watching alot of DVD's lately on my comp...man, i sure am lazy.  Today we had a TKD tourney today and i didnt do half ass bad, it was my first and i didnt have any gear...soooo.  Lets just say things didnt go completely smooth, i used a friends gear and got Second in Form.  I then got my ass handed to me by Sam Wilson's sibling Shayne, Blue belt (im green, he is a rank higher) in my first match of sparing...im glad he won the division though, better than that girl who everone cheated for...but its all good, i got two trophies so im happy.  kaz ma I, it really does...shit nigga, it dont matter.

I got to the beach and sat down, it started to drizzle, no biggie i thought...KABOOM, here comes the giant drops of death that hurt like hail.

Talked to some people, then tried to get some shut eye, went jank as shit and didnt get to sleep, barely even got comfertable...anyways.  Ate a good mix of fritos and ruffles (with ridges) BBQ chips...then had some strawberries in some water...then had the water.  Watched some crazy ass video that Zac suggested...but its all good.

       so i went to sleep and it all begun....  As the dream began, i was riding home on my moped after tkd...( NOTE, this will make no sense for i can only remember parts and will be trying to piece it together as i go)  SO im heading home frmo tkd and for some reason im trying to tow my bike? behind my ped, and i stop in some persons drive way to re attach it...and the first day its all normal...then that day ends...the next day i stop in the drive way and a man comes out and asks me if he can help...i ask him if he has any wire, and he says come wiht me and we go and get some metal hangers....that day ends  the next day i stop by but for some reason go to the door (this part is real scratchy)...and the family has 13 kids...its a father and a step mom, and it turns out that one of the kids was a friend of mine, todd.....  so after that whole thing, i guess my mind was finaly satisfied with that home, so this time after i leave that home i headed off to school...i was on my ped and parked it and saw a bunch of kids doing something on some bleachers outside so i decided i would go chec k it out...  they were on some kind of mini snow board and were trying to gring the railing's, i got one of the boards and did it, then the dream skipped ahead a long time, a few hours, days, who knows...  i was grinding down some super long railing and fell off, and kept falling, and landed in snow...and since it was a mini snow board started going...oddly enough there was a crazy guy with rabies chasing me...blah blah blah my dad pounds on the door i awake...  get out of bed (for real), and walk to the bathroom and there was a frog in the toilet....  blah blah i just butchered my morning, and im getting icked out of the home....later people...
