        so yeah it was a fairly good day kiljoi wasn't here so i was kinda mad and everything but i talked to her at so yeah and i have to go to this banquet type thing for my mom and dad their anniversary and my step-dad's birthday and i really don't wanna go. that made me even madder because i won't be able to talk to hardly ne of my friends and i won't be able to see my favorite shows like angel, the o.c., and smallville. and everything so I'm kinda  but i can live with me shows for a day or i should say evening. so umm i'm starting to develope an new friend for secret circumstances and everything so i guess he is kinda kewl although i thought he was stuck up yet quiet for some unknown reason but after u get to know him he's actually a kewl guy so yeah im just on the phone with kiljoi  now and she is reading a story to me about all of her friends and how they r great people esp. me all though she said i can't keep my darn ( she used another word) mouth shut. so yeah im signing off now must go buy a card for that crappy banquet.

        if you have a friend that is moving away and you have never had to deal with this type of thing what should you do? I think that the person should just like try to keep in touch with their friend in any way possible although the friend in question may be a really good friend that you feel u can tell everything. it like we all have to deal with different things in life and this is another stage that we haveto go through. so yeah another issue is will that person still be your friend when they come back since you haven't seen them all summer? will you and that person be as great of friends as you were before thye left ? or will you like make new friends ? I guess everyone think ahead sometimes but some think farther han others and that can make them great or that can make them paranoid. But if it is something really big like a friend moving for the summer then it is ok to be worried what will happen to you and your friend so yeah if u have any opinions my e-mail address is darckloud_skye29@hotmail.com and beastboy1@sbcglobal.net

        hey everybody I went to the concert and it was kinda fun, I guess I liked mostly all the bands (esp. ours). Although many people didn't thinkthat we did good I think we did and everyone is entitled to thier own opinions. So yeah I had a conference with Mrs.Brennan, Mr. Herz, Mrs. Stonis, Mrs.Lukich, Mrs. O' halloran , and the dreaded Mrs.Smith about my grades. They were all concerned and everything because they were all like " you are a very intelligent student and we know you can do better than you are now, you were doing great the first two quarters then your grades just tanked so...." yeah and they all like put in thier own opinions and everything and it made me fell good and bad at the same time. I think that they made me feel good because I felt that they were concerned enough to do that for me and all and it made me feel bad because i knew what i had to change and I didn't want to do it because I might fall asleep in class and i want to do it because I want to do better so i can be in the honors classes next year and they know I can do better than I am now an they implied that they expect great things fromme so yeah they said that they didn't want to see some with my talent and intelligence in a class where they know i should be. Yeah so i think the whole depression thing kicked in after that and i poured out my feeling to me best friend " the chi" she really puts things in perspective for me and she really makes me feel better. And yeah i really don't wanna have my schedule changed so I know what i have to do and I'm going to do just that and forget about the falling asleep in class if it will help me in the long run so I'm bout to shut down me comp and everything so I'll talk to "you people" (as sonya would say) later.  and yeah chichi I didn't tell sonya just for you and I'll see you later.

        why do i feel i have wronged everybody? why do i cry because one wanted me to go out with her friendand no to go out with the other. then a day later i'm still going out with her and i'm pegged as a back-stabber because i didn't know that the person i'm going out with is a good friend of my ex's . but thing about it is i shouldn't6 be crying i should just leave it alone. but the thing is now they are saying i don't listen to them and when i did i ended hurting myself by listening to and then arguing about it because i didn't and when i tried to do the right thing iended up breadrking up with her to pleaz my friend s and i love my friend but it hurts me. maybe this is just bmy depression talkin but i don't want to loose my friends because they are the only people that i can actually depend on. my mom is in chicago and sometimes i feel dshe doesn't love me and my grandma i love her to death but she can be harsh at times too. my brothers act like i'm not there when they are together they are like the only people i can depend on. wiothout them i don't knoiw where i would be. i love my whole family to death and i pray for my family and friends every night and i just hope this never happens again. my friends have never made me feel this bad before but, like they same there is a first time for everything.  like my motto says EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.  i guess i'll write to u later bai.

        yeah so today my aunt is having company over,a woman and her two girls. Well i guess i'll start with the lady, she is ok i haven't had any runnins's with her and she seems fine. My aunt has known her for a long time so i really don't care. now to the girls, they are very quiet and only talk to each other so far( i thought " how weird") but hey that completely fine with me so far. so when we came back from seeing Hellboy the movie my grandmother seemed fine. then i started to eat and she called me in her room" alonzo can u ask those girls if they wat to play card, jenga, get, on the computer, or eat or something? treat them like u would want to be treated" i said " why, i wouldn't want anybody to ask me anything seeing how i don't know them and all and they don't know me." i said ok ok and didn't do anything and got on the computer and looked for people on aim. then she called me back in there "did u do it?" i said "no"  she said " yoou all ate and don't you think that they might want to eat?" i was like" mommy there probably already ate before they got here" ( yes i call her mommy) " and she was like "alonzo!!!" i didn't say anything and walked away. then she all came out and walked past me " you still didn't do it did u?!" i was like "no" and she was like " I'm gunna tell lisa( my aunt) about this. go off the computer!!(this was when i was on the computer writing in my blog and had to turn it off) i was lik "ok" and thenm she said " u two girls want sumthing to eat?" they of course said yeah and then i have to make them hot dogs so they could eat chilli dogs( nasty hot dogs) and now they are done eating and sitting at the table talk to each other once again. I don't know maybe it will get better in due time but i don't really care so yeah we shall see sometime in the very near future wht shall happen between these girls and I.

        hey peoples, well neway, one of my friends thinks i've been mean and i've nbeen pondering what i have done wrong to make me mean. but yeah she won't talk to me, well she talks to me but when i asked her about wht i did to make me mean she was all " i so don't wanna hear this" but yeah i've thinking and the only thing i can't think of that i have done to her that was mean was when she had my cd and left it in canada and i was kinda upset and then when i called her bf a mofo, but i call everybody a mofo so it shouldn't be a bad thing. I think another thing i did wrong was when i was upset because she didn't call me so i could see wht her bf was like but yeah other than that i don't know. but the thing is she won't talk to me, so i don't know wht i did wrong.     well, another thing buggin me is my other friend is mad at me it was during spring break and it's like  LET IT GO!!!!  because her friend told her that the dude really does like her and she wantsme to apoligize for something i didn't do, and then when i apologized she wanted a reason why i was sorry. then when i gave her a reason she got mad and threw down the phone. but neway all of my friends know that i won't apologize for something i didn't do unless i had a good reason to and my reason was because i really don't wanna lose her as a friend, but yeah she doesn't understand that.   yeah well i'm single again and my ex-girlfriend told me today that she and my friend that is a girlare now going out but hey we're all still friends.

        Hi there well today we had our pool party and I found out that for my graduation present from my aunt and uncle/godparents they are buying me a plane ticket to go to Florida with them and take a tour of Disney World because they live like 25 miles away from there. So over all I had a good day. The only thing that brought me down was thinking about one of my friends ( who shall remain nameless) who is like changing because of this guy she likes and she always ditches me and her other friends just so she can walk home with him. The thing about it is she like spend every waking moment with him. For some reason she calls me all these names and it really irritates me and she knows that but the thing that makes the angriest is when she says these things, she knows it ticks me off, she continues to do it, and now most of the school thinks I am what she said I was becasue of a rumor that started. One of her friends or cousins or who ever beats on me everytime I go to the guy she likes ( who is also my friend) house and she does nothing about it. Then she will share thing with the guy and when I ask her she will be like " no" and I say "Why??" and she'll say "because I hate you" or she will bring up something that happened in the past for a reason not to share with me. Speaking of sharing she knows that most of the time I don't have money and when I do I try to share with her. Like on Sunday I let her borrow my video camera and now it's like it's all her's because she was making a movie and she still insults me with those usual yet very painful remarks she makes and some of the people she hangs around start to believe her and they don't take it from me when I tell them straight out when they ask me. But yeah over spring break she said that I said something that I really didn't say and she was mad at me for like month and a half after it supposedly happened and then when she found out that the guy actually liked her she wanted an apology for something I didn't do and that really ticked me off. I really don't know why she would think I would say something like that when we have been friends from the beginning of this school year. And I really don't want to lose her as a friend but I'm starting to question if she is really my friend because it's almost like she wants to be with him so much that she would give anything including her friend and almost like this attraction she has for him is ruling her life. I try my hardest to make everybody around me feel good and help them through their times of need and help them with their problems. But for some reason I feel like I am making to big a deal out of this and I should just tell her how I feel about the things she says to me, about me, and to other people because it's really bringing me down. I guess if I lose her as a friend I still have my other ones.    But I guess it all comes down to is this a phase or is she really my friend or maybe that's just how she is with guys that she likes.   Well to something less dramatic, my friends and I are graduating tomorrow. Yeah some people don't think there should be an 8th grade graduation. I guess they are doing this because some people don't always go to high school. But yeah my friend chichi is going to New jersey this summer and shemight be moving there but we'll see her threw-out the summer and next year. So I guess it's not that bad. Oh and my other friends Sonya is getting a job and she is going to teach me how to swim and play tennis, and we are going to get ready for next year because she wants to be on the football team and I want to be on the soccer team, so I have to work on my running and endurance.   Well anyway if you don't know who the person is I was talking about it was Kiara and Jonathan. So yeah.

        Well hey everybody, so yeah i actually had fun on the Chicago trip yesterday ( since it's like 12:45a.m.) Well yeah neway we (kiki,chichi,megan,and I) won the scavenger hunt at navy pier it's was actually fun. On monday I wasz really sad, mad, depressed, and disappointed in myself because i found out that i failed my Algebra final to see if I was going to go to Algebra 2, yeah i was actually crying, and what made me feel even worse was that most of the seventh grader in our class probably passed the test ( smart lil brats). My grams told me today that my spanish teacher called and told her that I'm going to Spanish 2 (Yaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy!!!!!!). OMG!!!! this is going to be sooo kewl omg. Well, at least I know i passed one of my finals ( seeing how they were both for honors classes). But still like sonya was saying it's probably for the best seeing how some of it i didn't understand clearly and I'll have to take it in high school now. So yeah I actually felt like I was smart because I was actually in a 9th grade math class and it gave me a since of confidence in my school of 8th grade, but truth be told I actually didn't know anybody in my Algebra class except Joe. Yeah I was lonely.   But back to the chicago trip, we went on this boat ride, it was kind of fun i liked the old building and stuff that we saw, other than that it was kind of boring. So yeah, we won ten dollars. We went to this place called " Excalibur", it was nice they had a DJ and everything and everybody was dancing and stuff, besides the fact that the music was mostly rap ( i don't like rap that much, but i can really listen to anything.). Then we went to Buckingham fountain the was cool. Then when we got back to the school I saw my bike and almost lost my freaking mind, while we were gone "havin' a grand ole time" in chicago, somebody stole or as some would say "jacked" my back tire. But the thing about it is they stole a freaking back tire ( i know they might have needed it, but COM'ON). Dude I was so freaking ticked off I was cursing up a storm when i was actually trying to stop cursing.   Anyway we are supposed to be have a pool party tomorrow and I have to walk to school. It should be nice but I don't know. Well people I hope u liked hearing about my misery. I'm gunna go read chichi's blog, since none of my other friends write in there blog anymore except erich and that's very rare. so yeah well g2g.........xoxox

        Well today we had our 8th grade graduation, which was kinda stupid in my eyes. They said the reason why they had and 8th grade grauation was because alot of kids weren't graduating from high school I can see why they did it. Yeah well there were kids crying and stuff i guess it's because of joy, some people were moving, and others might not get to graduate from high skewlor maybe they just will miss all of their friends and the school. So yeah i got a whole lot of money and a new watch and I'm supposed to be going to Disney world in july with my aunt and uncle. It should be fun.   Yeah I know i'll miss all the friends I had this school year and next year I'll make new friends but i don't wanna lose my old ones that i have because I feel I can really trust them with anything, even my life. But yeah chichi and sonya are really good friends they are like the best friends i have ever had in my life. So yeah well I don't wanna forget any of the friends I made this year or any of the ones I already had. But yeah I was supposed to learn to swim and play tennis but I have to go to my aunt for some of the summer. oh well.  congradulations to all

        I just realized yesterday, since today is technically friday that, Hey I'm a freshman now. But yeah I'm awaiting my classes that I will be in in high school to arrive in the mail. For some odd and extraordinary reason I'm always excited to start a new school year and go back to school,I don't know if it's the fact that i like to learn new things or what but I'm going to high school this fall. I just want to do good in school, be proud of myself, keep my friends, and go to college. For some reason my feelings have changed about high school but I still think it will just be another year of school but I'm rally excited about going to a new school and learning new things at that school. So this is Alonzo signing off.  p.s.  chichi if u got your classes for high school like ian did pleaz tell send mean e-mail and say for u erich if u are reading this, my e-mail is darckloud_skye29@hotmail.com

        Today I went to "Six Flags Great America" with the band and choir. It was fun my mom and my aunt we're chaperones and they were really fun and they said they had a nice time and so did I. I went on "The Raging Bull" for the first time today it was really awesome. My mom she was all scared of all of the roller coasters so she did get on any but we got alot of prizes when we played games. Yeah so all in all we had alot of fun.  So yeah i discovered like three days ago from my friends sonya that I'm body-conscious. Yeah I think I'm fat and everybody is all not you're not but they don't see what I see in the mirror in the morning. But yeah I want to lose some more weight over the summer and yeah well I guess I g2g.

        I'm kind of ticked off now because my family knows I don't like "bootleg" movies and jamille got some bootleg movies and brought them over here to watch knowing that my grams would want to watch them and my grams stopped buying them.   So yeah and last night I felt like I was very lonely because I was single and then  again I want to stay single because I'm too body conscious and I don't see how anybody could like me. But there are people that actually like and/or liked me like, beka ( dumped me but it's ok), megan, regina, anna sands, and some other people. So yeah I don't know why they like me seeing how I have low confidence, I'm body-conscious,and when i'm depressed I cry (i.e. when I failed my algebra test). So yeah well off that subject.  Well now it's storming and for some odd reason I'm fascinated by storms, tornadoes, hurricanes, and natural disasters (don't ask why)but yeah well i g2g.

        My brother(johnny) and my sisters( moomoo{carolyn joel}and alicia},stayed over for the holiday weekend. For once moomoo aka osama bin laden cka the terrorist was a good girl she didn't get into hardly any trouble. I can't believe at the age of 2 she had knocked over a tv bigger than her and had no remorse for doing it. Then the last time she was here i was talkin to sonya and she pulled the phone away from my ear and let i go and then it hit me in the face and to think she did all this because she wanted to talk to my friend. But yeah alicia is a little better she kewl this afternoon she was stealing my food when we started out sharing and then she started stealing my ribs and chicken that i was eating. Well neway I went to sleep at about 4 am because i was talkin to linZ about a subject that may remain nameless although peple reading this already know. lInZ said i was interesting and she said take that neway u want to, I still have yet to figure out what that means. So yeah  if u have any advice or u just want to insult me u can talk or just leave a comment .

        Last night I got in the this HUGE fight with kiara. Now it makes me feel bad because like chichi was saying if u want the frienship to work the work harder at it. But the thing is Kiara keep on being a stubborn little person and she calls me all these names like fag and all that other crap and that started because of a joke and she turned it into a rumor. And the whole 8th grade thought i was bisexual and i had to put up with that crap. Then she kept tyhe rumor going by calling me a fag/homo/homochuck and all that stuff. I asked her nicely( over the net)to stop calling me those names because they really irritate me or to at least just substitute those names with something else. ALL she had to say about that was "no" and " leave me alone" and after she said leave me alone I just left.I really tried to make this work i was always nice to her and I tried to comfort her in every way possible. Then I pray (to god) every night that all of my family and friends would stay together and everybody would be happy. But I guess this friend is not a friend anymore because I tried my hardest to make it work and she just doesn't want to budge. Sometimes I wish that i could just start life over from a certain point and then fast forward it again to see the outcome and if it's not right i could do it all over again and again. But that will never happen.    I just wish that she can change her ways and we could make this work out. But everthing happens for a reason and everbody has a differrent personality so you can't always keep the friends that you want if it's not meant to be.

        Hey people!!  I walked to "East Gate" at night for the first time. It was kinda fun because we were walking and Sonya tried to teach me "The Six Ways Not To Get Jumped When Walking In East Gate At Night"    #1.) don't act crazy  #2.) walk with your head down and put your hood on if u have a hoodie   #3.) if you see people walking towards you keep walking and don't talk to them  #4.)if you walk at night avoid people in big groups and people with metal poles   #5.) if they don't stop walking towards you run .....................for your life   AND NUMBER SIX, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL ...... #6.) be sarcastic, the ghetto people in East Gate don't understand sarcasm they take what you say literally   #7.) don't practice self-defense if they continue to approach you hand over all your money.

        Well, I guess I haven't wrote to you guys in a long time. Sorry, but yeah the only reason why is because, I was either talking to friends as I am now or on the computer. I got two new books Charlie Bone and the Invisible Boy (the last book of the series) and The Amulet of Samarkand (the first book a trilogy). So yeah and I'm getting an Aqua Center pass so we (Chris and I) can swim whenever we want and Sonya told me that at her pool they can pay once for the whole year and they have an indoor pool. I have to go to get my physical tomorrow so I can go to high school and so I can play soccer/volleyball. I really want to learn how to play soccer and be on the soccer team, I think it would be so cool.   Oh my god, it's Mickey Mouse anniversary, I don't know which one, but it's his anniversary. I think  Mickey Mouse is sooo cool because I think all kids our age grew up with him as children and he was like one of the best characters. Mickey Mouse is like, I don't know. I think I might get a tattoo of him as my first tattoo because it would remind he of when I was an innocent child.

        I had unusal dream last night. First it startd off woth Sonya and I walking around this boat and Sonya had a carton of eggs in her hands (I know it's weird but stick with me). Then this lady wearing a sailor's suit came out and asked us what we were doing and we just said "looking around the boat". So she walked us around the boat. Then all i remember was us in this kind of desert place and it had a consession stand (i know this desert has issues)and there were people from the boat out there with sonya and me. So then Sonya and I were standing in line and she was all " I don't wanna stand in the FREAKIN' LINE ANYMORE!!" Then there was this river time thing and the carton of eggs she has she threw them in there. Then the unbelieveable happened, these big green vines came out of the water and there was this guy closer to the water than us and it picked him up and detached themselves and transported him somewhere as he screamed. Then there were all theses other people that wanted to do it and they all started throwing stones and stuff in the water and they went along soaing through the air screaming and laughing. Then we were the only people left sonya, me, this model lady, and another man the threw this stones in the water.   {I've never had De Javu in a dream before so this was a first, i mean like i hada dream once that i was supposed to jump onto the vines after sonya hitched a ride with the guy that threwn the rocks, yeah it's kinda weird}  After the guy threw in his rocks the model lady hitched a ride with him and so did sonya and i got on with her. And at the top on the vines there was this big huge rock and it transported us to a place that looked like Greece and it was just beautiful. There was this one lady there and she was showing us around her little village type place or whatever it was kewl. So yeah then sonya and I were out of the picture and it went on to that lady that was showing us around her village and her roommate and they were ahving cookies and milk and looking at picture of high skewl boys and  she said " is it wrong to want to be with a high school guy?" and  then she was eatin here cookies in the bed and said what am i talkin about? But the thing about this is she then showed up at the school that the guy was at that she liked and she was lokingbaround  and she walkin into the gym and there were these two guys in a sleepin bag making out ( don't ask me why I had this dream i'm just the messenger) and uin the sleepin bag was the guy she liked and she said hi. Then after that she was the two guys got out of the sleepin bag and the guy she liked ( that's too long of a phrase i'm just gunna say "alan") started to talk toi her and she told him that she enrolled into the school, to be with him. And then they started going out and these guys wanted to beat up alan's ex like a week later and they then he had to stand up for him and he got beat up. Then the lady said ever since these two months  that i've been here all i've caused is trouble. And she wanted to leave and go back to Greece and the guy persuaded her not to got and he gate her this plate of peppered pepperoni and carrots with these black things on the side. And she said "I guess this dish'll have to introduced to Greece some other time"  then they all started laugh alan, his ex, the lady who was now a high school student and alan other friend.   I guess you could say they lived happily ever after, but i still don't know what this dream is supposed to mean to me, except that it was really weird.

        I'm really mad!! Sonya's in trouble because of her sister Pam. Pam calls partylines all the time and she went to see one of the people that she met in the partyline and knew next to nothing about. Sonya called her mom, other people, and I think she called the police to help look for her because of this stunt that she pulled.     Obviously they found her before anything happened to her. The police thanked her and Demarco for calling, and her mom put her on punishment because Pam told her mom that Sonya gave her the partyline number {although sonya never even calls partylines}.  Now Sonya is ticked off because she actually cared enough to actually call those people to look for her sister, when she could've just let her go and they would find her dead somewhere in a ditch or raped. But she's still in trouble and she has to put up with being on punishment because she cared and wanted to protect Pam from harm.   I'm really disappointed in Pam because I never thought that she would actually lie on her sister the way she did and get her in trouble for something she didn't do just so she would go down with her.

        YAY! LinZ started a new blog!! I'm supposed to be going back to P.A.A.C., and i have to deal with the people there and their attitudes and them saying I have an attitude just because I'm sarastic when I talk to them. But you know what I'm going to try to make this a good expirience. And the only reason why I'm actually going to join P.A.A.C. is because of Kiara and her saying " yeah i want you to come" so I'm gunna go. SO KIARA YOU BETTER BE HAPPY THIS IS ALL FOR YOU!!!!!! I saw Erich at the pool today with Alex and Janel I swam for about  45 minutes and then left with Kiki and chris and went to Walgreens and  Jonathan's house.  Yeah so chichi have a great relationship with "that guy" a.k.a. Erich- Mr. Zettikins   LinZ you're welcome it was a pleasure to come to your play.

        I just woke up like 2 minutes ago and I'm writing in my blog for the firt time in a long time.   Well anyway I had a dream last night, and it was high school graduation and everybody was getting stuff ready for it. After that was graduation time. We all graduated and stuff. Then LinZ had a speech that she messed up and or something, i'm not even sure if it was a speech, because she was using an over-head projector. Yeah and then after the ceremony nobody cried or anything, we all just went on with our lives, well I don't know but maybe in my dream they skipped that part of something. But after the graduation Linz was teaching. And I was like just looking up school or something or a form came in the mail or something, I don't remember. And the college that came in the mail or whatever was in Maryland, Maryland College of Veterinary Medicine. Then I took like a road trip or something to Maryland to see the school and my sister Alicia was there and she was still the age she is now and so was Anthony (my cousin). Then I started walking and they kinda sorta vanished but not like ran off or kidnapped or anything just like if my mom where to pick them up and take them back to Illinios. But than as I was walking I met the dude I don't know if it was Ryan Seacrest or somebody, but they were famous and it was like they were one of my friends (weird I know). And we were just walking and talking and stuff to me this part was weird. but yeah.                                                                                  Chichi I hope we can keep it touch while you're in NJ, I really do because if anything happens there I want you to be able to talk to me about. SO yeah and you will be miss chichi.

I dunno why but it akes me mad because I wanna talk to her and kiki told me she is home, but if she is home why doesn't she get online so we can talk?

        Chichi's time in Park Forest is getting shorter and shorter. She's leaving on Friday and I might only be able to talk to her on Thursday ( if I'm lucky). Because I want her to be there to be one of the first people I see when I get back next week. I'm gunna miss her I swear I will, yeah she is a great person and an even better friend, I guess I'll see her when she comes back. But Sonya, LinZ, Erich, and I will always love you Chichi don't you forget that. So yeah Chichi tell your mom I said "hi" and remember if you want to you can send me a letter and I'll write back.  I'm gunna try to learn some Latin and put it in my letter to you. Well, Chichi if I don't get a chance to do this before you leave * hugs Chichi and kneels down and gives her a kiss on the hand* I love ya Chi and I always will your a great friend and a great person. If your family brings you down in any sort of way just write about it like in a notebook or draw something to get your mind off of them. Don't fret it will be ok, trust me it will. ^_^                      sincerely your pal,                                      Lonzi/lonzzi/lonzo/ and the infamous "turkeh"    I'm gunna miss you for those 5-6 weeks yer gone.

        Yeah, I just got done talking to my Auntie Lisa and we were talking about how the Spanish that we learn in America won't do us any good if we go to another country. The reason is because there are five different dialects of Spanish depending on where you live. So if we go to like Brazil or Portugal or something they might not speak the same form of Spanish that we do. That kind of a dumber because we might have to learn 4 more types of Spanish.       And I was also thinking about learning Latin, although it may be considered a "dead language" that's the main reason why I want to learn it and the fact that if you know Latin then you can pick up on words in different languages, because most languages are derived from Latin. And my Aunt Lisa was saying that "You should know Latin because, if you take another languages it will be easier to understand, because most languages are derived from Latin." But yeah that would be cool, there was actually one point and time in my life when I want to be a Linguist so I could travel the world and be able to communicate. So I guess if I learn as many languages as I can then I might be a linguist. ^_^ I really want to go to Japan and China but the Japanese and Chinese languages are two of the most advance and difficult languages in the world.                       Chichi I wonder what life will be like when you go to NJ for 5-6 weeks, But just in case you wanna send me some thing like a letter here's my address (although you probably already know it) 2700 Western Ave. *zip* 60466 feel free to send me a letter when you get the if you wanna talk and I will try to write you back.    *^* muah*^*

        Yeah I know it's 1:55 am but I need to get this off my mind. For some reason I'm still mourning over the fact that I didn't make it into Algebra 2,I studied hard and did all I could to succeed. I tried to ask for help and all that good stuff. I mean I went into that test confident that I was going to pass and hear Mrs. Brennan say those all powerful and satisfying words to me " Alonzo you will be in Algebra 2" but no the words never passed her lips. I asked her "Did I pass the test?" she she boldly with not regret replied instantly " No you didn't but I'll show you your test Wednesday." I don't know anybody that wanted to be in Algebra 2 as much as I did. I mean, it meant so much to me. ( believe it or not I'm crying right now because of this) Because I had set in my mind that I was going to prove to all those people in that classroom that I was as smart as they were maybe not smarter but at least as smart as them. But no the only thing I thought I was great at, which was academics, failed me. Sometimes I wish I were never born and thenm I wouldn't have to deal with having to get F's and be critisized because I read slower than other people and that I don't catch on to things as well as others. And to see everybody else move on like Chichi, Sonya, LinZ, and all the rest of my friends,to see them happy makes me feel like I shouldn't even be considered their friend. Someties I feel like I'm there for comfort and I'm just a guy who is sure who he is and nobody can figure that out but me and only me. and the fact that I am still crying makes me feel even worse because I don't like to show my weaknesses to the world and I consider academic failure  a weakness. Even though I always joked about getting F's on my algebra tests on the inside I was crying because I was never used to get bad grades and I hated it and I felt like I was letting my whole family down because I was considered the smart oine the one the gets the best grades, the one that was destined to be something great, but on the inside I'm jsut some kind that thinks he's actually has thew talent to be a veterinarian or a zoologist although I am allergic to cat and dog dander. I never thought that my feelings were this deep and if I think that the only reason I am on this earth is for failure to succeed then I am just making myself feel worse but. Like I always say everything happens for a reason, but what reason is there for the only hope that I had to prove to myself and to others that I actually was smart to be crushed like an ant that is smash by a curious child? I mean I really don't know what's wrong with me, I'm crying over a stupid test that I took 3 maybe 4 months ago, but the reason for this drama is because Mrs. Brennan made the test seem larger than life itself, like it I passed this test I would be proud of myself and actually have an ounces of confidence that I would actually do something good in my life, but instead I failed a test that means so much to me and confidence levels drowns in a pitch black abyss of failure to succeed and prove to myself who I am and who I will be. And then when my friends comfort me I say that I'm fine when in actuality I am lying to them because they made me feel good for maybe 30 minutes and then all of those feeling come tumbling down on me again. I just feel like a complete and TOTAL IDIOT to think that my unimportant exsistance would actually mean something to allof those people out there. I just to tell myself that I was useless, worthless, and invisible to the world, well what do you know my past has come back to haunt me, and all I feel is pain because I have failed my family and my friends because they are reading this and then they feel like they have to comfort me and try to make me feel better.  I'm sorry guys that I wrote this whole blog abpuit what I haven't achieved and stuff but I had to get it out. I love you guys and sorry I guess I'll talk to you later * continues to cry as he publishes this for all to read*

        I really hate to see Chichi go but as we were talking about last night and this morning everybody has to move on. But still Chichi is coming back in like the beginning of August (agosto), I think. Last night Chichi and I were remembering all of the "Good Times" we've spend together and all that good stuff. It was kewl because we start to go over like our whole friendship and how we would miss each other and how she is one to be missed because she is such a great/ ausie gal or as some would say "chik". I really hope she does n't move to NJ brb people,.

        Lovin' the picture Chichi and you should've slapped the dude that kept grinding you ~_^. Well yeah, another boring day around here. I'm supposed to be going to Sonya's church on Friday when I get back home, YAY!!! Then like on Saturday I am going to LinZ's house to watch "Secret Window" and Sonya might be coming. So yeah I'm kind of upset because my classes for Rich East didn't come yet and almost EVERYbody else got thier's already. But the only reason I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill is because I like school and I want to see if I got all the classes I wanted and I'm kinda sorta not really excited about going to RE, but hey, I gotta make the best out of it ya' know.    OMG CHICHI'S LEAVIN ON FRIDAY AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO TELL HER BYE IN PERSON, CHICHI GET ON AIM I WANNA TALK TO YOU. PLEASE PLEASE CHICHI GET  ON AIM. You just gotta love the Chi-ster I mean it's hard not to. Got to love her just got to. *muah* that's for all you people that want a kiss from me but won't admit it ( my way of being a concieted jerk aka arrogant person * mi amigos know that I'm hardly ever that way, if you don't shame on you, because you need to spend more time with me*)

        What make the people you know you can't have so desirable? Is it because of the fact that you know you can't be with them? Or maybe it's because you are so familiar with them and you are around them so much that they are so tempting?   Most people because they can't have someone or something want it more and more because they know they can't have them/it.  For example ( this example will be hilarious to some and confuseing to others) Elizabeth Anderson knows she can't have E.Z. and yet she constantly goes after him and protects his as is he were her child. *no offense Chichi and Erich, but it's true* Many people have told me of a certain fiasco at Central Park and Kiara took Erich's cell phone and then Elizabeth started to chase her and try to get it back, knowing that in her efforts to do that it wouldn't change the way Erich felt or I should say didn't feel about her.     I guess it will always be a mystery as to why people want the things/people that they know they can't have. But for a select few they get that person/thing that they want. * Yippee! for them*

        "I know I can do it," said Ted Downey helping himself to another ear of corn from the steaming bowl," and in time her death will be a mystery..................... even to me."   If you haven't seen "Secret Window" already you should see it, in my eyes that movie was great, it may have started off a little slow but it gets better as you watch. The only thing I don't get is, why did he grow corn where he buried the bodies? Because if he ate the corn (which he did) in each ear of corn there would be pieces of her in it. I loved the way they made John Shooter's character because the man that played him he actually seems like he could be a crazy person and when they showed Morton rainy and his "other half" or the side that was trying to tell him that he actually did all those things, that part was awesome because it showed you that he was crazy or whatever. I don't know why and don't ask me why but sometimes crazy people, in movies, seem cool to me for some odd reason. Well anyway, I guess I said all that to say that I like that movie.

        Like at 11:35 I got done watching "underworld". That movie was awesome, well at least to me it was. Kate Beckinsale, I see why Josh thinks she's hot, mainly because of the simple fact that, she is. I think that they might make an "Underworld 2", the ending made it seem as if the "adventure" wasn't over yet. But anyway my cousin's friend *LinZ you know who that is* ~_^ is supposed to be making me a "Blacked Eyed Peas" cd, I like them, as a musical group that is. But yeah I guess I'll talk to you guys/girls later. Sweet Dreams!

        Have you ever been in a relationship that you thought for sure would work out but everybody else didn't?  Well anyway, my ex-girlfriend (since she broke up with me at like 11:55) told her cousin to call me this morning. Heather (her cousin) said "Hi, are you and megan still going out?" I said "Yeah?" she said " Guess again."  I said "No? why?" she tled me "She said that it's over." I was like " why?" then she said "She said that you always yell at her and she's you think she's supposed to take it and everytime she or Jesse hangs up on you, you get mad or whatever said yell and her and you always say 'f*ck you' or w/e "Most of the time when she hangs up on me I really don't care because I accidently hang up on people all the time and then only time I did get upset with her was when she hung up on me on purpose and I called her back and started talking or whatever and she wouldn't talk to me and then she started getting an attitude or w/e and I told the that she needs to get that log outta her @$$, because I didn't do anything to her, and I wasn't even yelling when I said that." And anybody that "knows" me knows that I have a rule that I never hit girls the only time I do is when sonya and I are playin around and I really don't even hit her.   And then Heather said that Megan said that everytime she calls me either nobody picks up or  I don't talk to her, and I was thinking * what he heck man* and then I told her everytime I call her she never talks and then she clicked over to talk to megan and megan said " well whatever it's still over"   But anyway I really don't care because I've to deal with break-ups alot in my life, although I've only been with three girls in my life. But anyway Sonya is going to Canada on like Friday so I have to spend as much time with her as I can.     But anyway I guess all those people that said our relationship wasn't gunna work were right.  But anyway I guess I'll get over it.

        About an hour ago I came home from LinZ's party, man that party was awesome. We (Linz,Stephanie,Zach, and I) had fun we made up words by playing "Scrbble" talked, laughed, ate, had blonde moments, watched tv, and listened to music. Yeah one of tghe fun words was "Jrshamoff"- displaying immaturity at a fifth gradde level. lol. But yea that party was really kewland some other stuff happened today having to do with an e-mail and a phone call that confirmed the e-mail. I know it's cryptic, but that's what I what it to be!!

         Kinda Happy and Yet Not&nbsp;     &nbsp;   Yeah, I'm happy because I'm going out with somebody and I'm starting to forget about my break-up with "squizzy".&nbsp; Most of you guys already know who the person is that I'm going out with she's smart, funny, nice, and all that good stuff. So yeah well that's the good part.     &nbsp;   The bad part&nbsp;is my mom said she would be here on Friday to pick me up so I could go over her house and I'm still here. But yeah I'm really not that down about it because I already knew that it would take her a long time to come and get me and I've had more time to talk to my friends and new gf.&nbsp; Because for one I want to talk to then before they leave because like Kiara is leaving in like an hour and a half for a night in Miami and then she is going on a cruise and she'll be in the Bahamas when she gets off the boat. *so kewl, I know* Then Sonya is going to Canada on like Thursday and staying there for almost the whole summer. LinZ is going to New York sometimes I think this week coming, wait, it might be the week after this week I can't remember. Stephanie *yea "blondie" yer one of my friends* is going to Colorado. And then I'm going to Florida on the 8th of August and I'm gunna go to Disney World for the first time in a long time, I think the last time I went to Disney World was when I was like 5.&nbsp; But yeah it should be fun.     &nbsp;   CHICHI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE MISS YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       Sometimes I'll think about things like random things and I'll be in like deep thought or whatever you wanna call it and I just think to myself "I should write this down, there's some really interesting things going on up there and if somebody found it and read it it might change their life in some way." I know now you guys like I'm weird but, I just sit and think when I'm bored and I don't want to watch tv or read. But anyway back to my point I found this red notebook that I wrote in like once because I was depressed or whatever and I wanted to write it down because I thought it would help and now I'm going to start writing in that when I go into those "deep thought" session or episodes, you pick what you want to call them. I think I might benefit me in the long-run, ya' never know.   &nbsp; I'm gunna have to get back into my old sleeping habits since we're starting school on August 16th. The only benefit that we get from going to school before everybody else is that we get out of school earlier. But I have to walk to school, I mean I can walk to school but it's just the walking to school in the winter that gets me worried because I might wake up late and I can ride my bike in the snow. Then there's that fact that I'd have nobody to take me to school, so I'd either have to walk to school and be later or stay home. Exactly why I have to get to sleep earlier and all that good stuff because if I don't I'll fall asleep in class, *stop laughing, last year I had sleeping problems* I won't wake up late, and I remembered that they say that if you don't get enough sleep then you don't "grow" at the rate you're supposed to. so yeah. But I guess I'll go now since it'slike 2:42 am right now and I'm still typing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good sleepy time *inside joke* ^_^

       Hey guy I haven't posted in a long time. But I have been checking blogs and alot of people have been posting. Sonya's back, Chichi is coming back in like three weeks, and my beloved &nbsp;LinZ is going to New York in like a week in a half. Sonya brought mw back a lighter from Canadia *yay* it's like a car and the only thing I don't like aboiut it is the marajuana sign on it althought I haven't seen it yet.    I just found out today that Nia * a friend* doesn't like rap music.   Why does it seem like all the ghetto kids are dumb and all the kids that aren't ghetto and listen to like alternative and punk music and stuff like that are smart?  I really think that this is the generation of smart and artsy kids.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  I have a true issuse- I don't know who I am. I know it sounds stupid but it's important to me because I don't know alot about myself and the only person that can help me "find myself" is myself. I tried listing all the things that I liked and disliked but that didn't work to well. I just hope that I turn out to be a great guy that makes a differnce in peoples lives in the future.

       You here about souls all the time but, what is your soul? Is your soul a life force within your body? Or is it like the your spirit? *another question- how do you have a spirit if you're not dead yet?*&nbsp; is your soul something that everybody needs to live? so what is a soul?    please post a comment if you read this and you can answer my questions thanx   And Chichi, LinZ, and Sonya *who never reads my blog* I could use some of your opinions because they are most of the time always great.

       Love and passion are two of the things that drive people the most. Some people have a passion for knowledge and that drives them to stay in school, work hard, and pursue their dreams.&nbsp; Other people are passionate for other things, they can be unique things or they can be normal things but whatever drives a person is what keeps them going. Like Chichi wants to be an artist and she does. LinZ wants to be an actress and she loves to dance and she's always in drama and she even works in a theatre to help little kids out and usher for their plays. Most of the time if you don't know what you want out of life it will soon come to you and then you will become passionate for the thing and work hard so you can get it.    Love is another subject. Some people that have families will do anything and I mean anything to keep them safe. Even if it seems like your parents don't love you they would probably do anything for you because of that love that they have for you. Most kids think that their parents don't care about them because their parents don't spend that much time with them, even if your parents don't spend that much time with you they would probably do anything to protect for from harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;   I really have no idea why I chose to write about this, I just wanted to post. ^_^

      If the future is in your own hands, then why do people question what the future will be like? If you  have control over your own life and it's not "predestined" (by god) then why does it some people question what will happen to them?    *change of subject* Sometimes I feel like I'm not pleas ing  friends (like making them happy or comfortable) in some kind of way. Most of the time I feel like I'm "wronging" my friends in some kind of way because, like sometimes my friends will be like mad at me for a reason I don't know why and it really irritates me.  I really like wanna have all my friends and not have any of my have have secrets or "unmentionables" like a certain "posse" that I know of. But still of my friends like have raging emotions and it feels like I'm stuck in the middle of it all and like they 're all just like not talking and I feel like I did something wrong and I need to find a way to fix it before our friendship breaks up or crumbles. But yeah I guess I'll go. leave a commnet if you want. ^_^

I really need to start reading more and stop being lazy I should read before I go to bed. But anyway I can't wait until school starts I'll be back into my old ways and learning again which makes me happy I just don't wanna have to put up with the snobby kids and the teachers that I may not like but I'll try to "keep my cool" lol ttyl bye

       I can't stand my grams right now because she just got done feeding me all this shit about how irresponsible because I let one of my friends borrow my bike without asking her *how could I if she wasn't in Downtown PF at the time*, I let another friend get some books from the library and they're overdue by like two months she offered to pay the fine and my grandma never said if sshe wanted her to pay it or not and she mad because of that and she says that I have not sense of value of money. And then another friend made collect calls to the house and the racked up to $48 and I thought that they were only 5 cents a minute when they weren't and now they're on the bill and she has to pay that * how am I suppose to know how much every single collect call company charges?* and now I'm getting my phone taken away because of this bullshit and it's really fucked up and it irritates the fuck out of  me. Well there goes my social life because the only way that most of my friends and I communicate is by the means of phone and in person and if you take the phone away then how am I gunna be able to get help on my homework if they know how to do it and I don't how am I gunna be able to go places with them if I can't get in touch with them? that's just a bunch of bullshit unless I go over to one of they're houses I'm not gunna get help from my friends and if she takes away the phone then I'll just be spending more time with them after school to do my work since I can't talk to them on the phone. so  OOOOOO and yeah I just feel like I wanna throw my tv, bed, and computer out of my window right now I'm so mad.I don't think that I've ever been this mad. THANX GRAMS YER THE BEST!!!!!!!!!! sorry about the sarcasm and swearing but that's how I feel although I love my grams to death this really ticks me off!!

       Hey peoples, I'm bored I should be calling that "College Coach" place to figure out how to use this thingie since my grams paid $1300 for me to have it and use it to study for the SAT's and the ACT test but I've been lazy and unfocused. But yeah I feel really bad that I'm not using it and she spent all that money getting me the help. And even though I know that it might be able to help me get into IMSA because I have to take the SAT 1 test I'm too lazy to do it. I really need to get focused again before we go back to school. Speaking of school, I want this high school experience to be a good one (although I've heard that for many people it wasn't) and I just hate it when people talk to me like I'm some 4 year old that was just released from "Cradle for Dummies Institution" *made-up organization to show emphasis on my hate for the condensendence of teachers*. I can't wait until I go to Florida it's gunna be so much fun, just hope Mustaafa doesn't cause me any problems, if I use my allergy medication I should be ok. I really should be reading my book or working on that "College Coach" thing instead of watchin tv and staying on the computer. ~^~ LAZINESS WILL BE THE END OF OUR YOUTH~^~ I don't know why but I love school and I love to learn and some people call me weird because I do. I think that my only reason for living is to learn because sometimes I think that I will just stay in school all my life and try to learn all I can or I could just learn by the means of books, internet, and experiencing the life that I have on this earth. But that's just me although I have low confidence, I really like to go after the things that I want and try my best to get them.  I have a question. If you constantly talk to yourself when you're alone about your life and what happens to you and what might happen to other people, even if it's the simplest thing like what you will be like in the future, what the world will be like in the future or just anything at all like family and friends, does that make you crazy if you talk to yourself about things that you think matter?  I love you Chichi, Sonya, and LinZ and feel free to post in your blogs about this if you're reading this. Anybody can post if you want and you can post about my blogs anytime I post so I don't have to keep typing the same thing at the bottom of every post that I make. ^_^

       Yesterday (technically) I went and registered for RE (rich east), not to mention that I was pissed because I was sleepy, hungry, and didn't want to be there and I had to wear a great big smile for everybody there. Sounds fun, doesn't it? But yeah other than that it's been an action packed day, Sonya and Jonathan aren't friends with Kiara anymore because of something that Joathan and I kept pressuring Sonya to tell us. LinZ is leaving for NY like tomorrow, I think.  Like the only good thing that came out of this day was I got to talk to Sonya & LinZ today, on the phone *ssshhh............I'm on punishment and I can't be on the phone for the rest of the month*  Chichi is coming home in 8 days!!!!!!!!!!!!  YAY!!!!!!!!! but yeah I'm kinda sleepy and I have to pack for Florida because we leave or Sunday, I think. Should be fun although My aunt and uncle have a dog and he might mess with my allergies *I hope he doesn't, that cute lil' doggie*. My cousin named him Mustaafa, don't ask I had no say in what his name was. I hope some people invent a medincine that can help people that are allergic to pet dander, I really wanna be a veterinarian, that's what I hope my career will be when I get older. But anyway. Love ya'll! I have to save money so I can buy souveniers. ain't that about some crap?

She told me that she was turning 49 this year and I swear to god she doesn't look it, I thought she was like in her thirties. But yeah I'm being lazy again and I didn't get my ID yet I have to shower and all that good stuff before I do. That's a fun filled day in the life of Alonzo. I guess I'll ttypl ^_^

       Let me ask you this, if you're trying to be a considerate friend and let your friend get a book from the library or borrow your bike, does that make you irresponsible?       Because it seems like it does to my grandmother since doing things for my friends makes me irresposible and shows that I have no "sense of value" for money. The reason why I do things for my friends is because I am a friend and I have good friends that I know would do the same thing for me but no my grandmother seems to think that all my friends are just there and using me somehow *well at least that's what I think she thinks*. But in reality I have the best friends that a guy could have in the world, Sonya, Chichi, Kiara,LinZ, and Jonathan, all great people and even greater friends. I really will miss them if any of us move away.       Yeah well I g2g to the pool and I might swim but I have to get my swim pass so I can get on the plane. * they need a picture ID* ttyl

        THE LONZIAN TIMES ~corny but it works~       what's new? -    ~ grams isn't budging on the phone thing even after I apologized in a nice, calm fashion       ~ Chris (my brother) is being a little stubborn whore again and now I can only be on the computer for the odd hours *1,3,5,7,9,11*       ~ looks like what I said would happen if I had no phone is happening. My friends went to the movies and I missed them, they saw "The Village" again and sneaked into "Thunderbirds" which I really wanted to see, and I could've avoided getting my phone taken away if I made there in time to go with them, because my grams would've never found out that my bike wasn't here if I wasn't here.      ~ LinZ is in NY now I have to get her and some other people souveniers from Florida when I go on Sunday.  *we're just gunna have to see what the future holds for me and my social life. This is exactly why I hate my family because they're stubborn whores, every single one of them. I think it's a family trait. but anyway I'll try to cool off.

        This is something that I said and then "moo moo" repeated I said "My life, my desire" and then moo moo said "My life, I decide" mind you this was less than 30 seconds ago but her mistake in repeating what I said struck something in my mind. But the thing that made me wonder the most was, she's only 4 years old and she spat out this words without knowing what they meant and they made perfect sense and actually just made that phrase come to life because, you do decide what your life will be like because your life is yours and no one   else's. But yeah ttypl ^_^

         What causes people to destroy themselves or other people emotionally, physically, or mentally?    Some people say they "scar" themselves*physically* because it's the only pain they can control, it makes the pain go away, or it calms them and there are many other reasons.    If it's the only pain you can control wouldn't you want there to be no more pain than you already have in your life? If so, then why would you add more pain on top of what you already have?    If it calms you, wouldn't it make you more tense because you have to deal with try not to hit any veins or arteries that are vital to your survival? Why can't you find an alternate way to calm yourself other than hurting yourself in a self-destructing manner?    How does it make the pain go away if it hurts you and you have to deal with the scars that you leave behind? And how does it make the pain go away if you are causing other people pain?    Emotional-destruction~    Why do some parents bring their children down and make them feel like dirt if they truly and honestly love them? Why do they say the things they do if it makes their child cry or become depressed and leads to "other things"?    Mental Destruction~    Why do some people make themselves believe that they can't do something when they know that they are perfectly capable of doing it? Why do some people do things and then they allow them to become habits that may be hard to break?       All questions that would like an answer but don't necessarily need one. But yeah chichi's coming home in like less than a week! YAY! although I don't know what LinZ is coming back I hoe she has a nice time in NY. Yeah people don't fret about going back to school because it's natural and if you don't do it you never know what your future might have been without it.
