      there is one catchy part to the story...kagome the reincarnation of kikyo, accidentally falls into the well of inuyasha! She was being dragged by a nasty monster, "lady centipede" who actually dwelled and lived in that well waiting for her chance to get her hands on the sacred jewel in kagome's body! kagome , with extraordinary powers from the jewel and her mysterious powers from kikyo, escapes. she then ends up in the futile era of japan, instead of the present time! anyways, i can't tell ya the WHOLE story! its complicated. Anway, she later on meets inuyasha, a half demon who at first wrongly thought of her as kikyo, who hooked him with her sacred arrow on a big sacred tree. I'll have to skipp a lot of parts. kagome,  who's trying to kill a bird who swalloed the sacred jewel, who is in the process of turning into a more evil and bigger stronger beast, with her sacred arrow she hits the bird, one bad mistake... she shatters the whole sacred jewel! causing it to spread faraways in japan! inuyasha, who is in a spell, kinda like a dog leash is being put under control by the one and only, kagome, must join forces to gather all the shards of the sacred jewel, before disaster stikes everywhere!in time, inuyasha begins to like kagome, and show his softer side, not that he means to. but then! kikyo goes to life! wich really mess things up for kagome.she's okay with it though, even if she's second in inuyasha's heart. at their journeys they meet, certain people, who where also deceived by the evil noraku, together they join forces to find and kill him. Their journeys take them to an amazing journey of a quest of friendship, courage, love maybe...,ambitions, and vengence.&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      Actually, sorry about the caption I wrote earlier, it was kinda a ittle wrong. Kagome had a whole sacred jewel in her body. This pic here is inuyasha and kikyo( when she was still alive and NOT evil) they used to be lovers. not anymore. After she was killed by the jelous Onigumo, who turned himself to noraku, she was brought back to the world of the living, with only female souls to support her. she wasn't completely alive, but she turned a little evil. 50 yrs. had passed since she died then came back to life only to find out that noraku was the one who killed her, disguising himself as inuyasha. She then knew that she had wrongly killed inuyasha with the wrong reasons. And inuyasha, knowing the truth, had taken his grudge away against kikyo for killing him. but yet the relationship has been destroyed, just because of the evil shape shifting master , Noraku. Although the love that kikyo used to have towards inuyasha has dissoled to ashes, inuyasha still has feelings for her.theres one catchy part though...&nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

After she died by the deceiving Noraku a bad nasty monster evil dude, she takes the "shikon no tama", a jewel of awsome powers, to her grave. well a lots of yrs,. passed until it was in the present day tokyo  japan, there a girl named kagome, reincarnation of kikyo is obliviuos that there is a sacred jewel shard in her body! tell ya more when i send more pics, pretty complicated story. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

       urlLink    Daniel Radcliffe the hot teen guy who plays the roles of Harry Potter in the great hit of Rowling's book. Daniel has grown up so much, its visible. He loves playing on his guitar, likes the music rock, and has a love interest to the beautiful actress Cameron Diaz! He has played such a good actor for the role that he's in! Almost everybody in my school likes him, because of his very persuading charms. Daniel Radcliffe is in fact only 14 yrs. old! &nbsp; urlLink

      june again, yessssss! i am soo glad! wel this is what happened:          As i walked through the raging waves of students to the lockerbay,i pushed myself to the sidelines of the breezeways, as i clinged to the railings, my heart just stopped. there, i saw the love of my life, standing as tall as he is, with his backpack and skateboard at his left hand, he takes a glance of me and ... at that moment, my heart just went to my throat! as that moment i lingered so, he then SMILES at me! me, directly me! i was so calm looking  at the outside but in the inside, i could barely breath. and yet, i smiled at him too!ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! romance is great. to all that is reading this, if you like someone, always take chances because these kind of things, are worth remembering.   To all Harry potter fans, you all should really like the new movie! its dang awsome!Daniel Radcliffe and all the other cast, has really grown up i must say... they getting hot too.:) later, june
