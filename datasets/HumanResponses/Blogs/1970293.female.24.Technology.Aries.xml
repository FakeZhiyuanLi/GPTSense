      11/20/03   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | The life of a Doctor's assistant    This is an interesting article about the assistants on Doctor Who.  Of course they do not go into each of the assistants lives but they do go into detail on Elisabeth Sladen who played Sarah Jane.  She played under the roles of Jon Pertwee and Tom Baker during the years 1973 to 1976.    I do remember her fondly but she wasn't one of my favorite assistants.  Each assistant had a role to perform and in my opinion a difficult one.  They had to fit in with the Doctor's personality in order to keep the show interesting.  Sladen had her own style in which she supported the role of the Doctor completely as well as added a flare to the show.  That is enough of my two cents, read the article.  It's fairly well written.

      11/20/04   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | Fond memories of Doctor Who    This is truly a wonderful article that takes one back into time.  I can still remember the night my brother got me to watch the show.  It was late and I was tired but I stayed awake with determination.  I can't remember which episode it was but I do remember the Doctor was Sylvestor McCoy with I believe Mel as his assistant.  I believe it was right before Ace became the assistant.  Now remember that I was watching this in the states and the PBS station had the show on right after Red Dwarf at around midnight.  It was so weird that I had to watch it again the next week.    Soon I had met the Daleks and the Cybermen as well as the Master with his evil plans.  I have to say that the Daleks were so unique that I still go around sometimes saying "Exterminate. Exterminate."  The Cybermen with their strange warfare and way of walking.  The Master I believe had to be the most interesting because here you learn that at one time he was also a Time Lord.  It really takes you back when you find that out that you wonder about the Doctor's own past.

      12/2/03   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | Buffy 'inspires Doctor sidekick'    It would be really neat to have Anthony Head as the new Doctor but does he really have it or will people always remember him as the watcher from that famous tv series Buffy The Vampire Slayer.  In my opinion, I would always think of Buffy every time I saw him as the Doctor and that could distract me at first.  I am sure that I could get used to the idea but I wonder.  He is a really great actor especially in his role as Mr. Giles, Librarian and Watcher on the show.  As the show progressed he becamse a father figure for Buffy and then later he became a character who lived in England.  At that point he was no longer one of the main characters but someone who guest starred on the show for a few minutes.  As Giles he really added to the story line at the beginning.  He was the true leader with his books and plans and Buffy was the one who acted them out.  I guess they had to show that Buffy could be on her own and make her own decisions and plans without Mr. Giles.    I just can't see him as the Doctor though even though he is a great actor.

      1/15/04   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | BBC finds missing Dalek episode    Wow.  Now there is a surprise.  After all these years of wondering if that episode was gone forever and suddenly it appears back on the scene.  Another episode about the Daleks that I can't wait to see.  Hopefully they will allow the public to view it.    Now there are several missing episodes especially from the early years of Hartnell, Troughton, and Pertwee.  Among those lost there has been some recoveries through the years.  If you would like more information about the missing episodes as well as the recoveries try this site  urlLink LOST AND FOUND EPISODES OF "DOCTOR WHO" .

      3/22/04  urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | Eccleston is new Doctor Who   |  urlLink BBC NEWS | UK | Who is new doctor?   Woohoo the dreams and happiness of every Doctor Who fans around the world have finally been realized.  There will be a new season of Doctor Who with Christopher Eccleston playing the Doctor.  Again I can't claim I am familiar with his work but truthfully I don't care.  As long as he can pull off the role of the Doctor I am contented.  With a long line of characters William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, and Paul McGann, Eccleston will make the 9th Doctor.  I can't wait to see his acting styles and his way of presenting the doctor.    I do have to admit that my favorite doctor is not Tom Baker but Sylvester McCoy.  The reason I can give for this is that when I started to watch the Doctor I had started with Sylvester McCoy.  I got used to his style before watching the other seasons with the other Doctors.  I do like Tom Baker though but he is second to McCoy.

      5/28/04   urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | Doctor Who fans back Billie Piper  |  urlLink BBC NEWS | Entertainment | TV and Radio | Billie Piper is Doctor Who helper   Now I don't remember Billie Piper but I do know that most of the assistants were young beautiful and full of spunk.  I am sure that she will contribute greatly to the role as Rose Tyler.  She was born in 1982 and soon started in theatre before signing a record deal in 1998.  It looks like she has some experience in acting and hopefully will fill the role with her own characteristics and personality.  Everyone around the world is waiting patiently for the new season and I am one of them.  I also realize that I might not get to see them immediately since I am not from England.  I might have to wait a little while longer before I get to see them.

      5/24/04   urlLink BBC NEWS | In Pictures | In pictures: Doctor Who's assistants   Oh this is a great article that takes one back in time to all the great assistants and their roles in the episodes.  Vicki, Steven Taylor, Jamie McCrimmon, Deborah Watling, Zoe Herriot, The Brigadier, Sarah Jane Smith, Leela, K9 with Romana II, Tegan Jovanka, Nicola Bryant, Bonnie Langford, and finally Ace.  Billie Piper has a lot to live up to with so many great assistants.  I must confess my favorite assistant is Ace maybe because she didn't act like a normal assistant.  She was always going around blowing things up and saying "Wicked!" and "Ace" which enhanced the show.

      5/13/04  urlLink BBC NEWS | Wales | North East Wales | Dr Who fan builds garden tardis    Wow he must have a lot of time on his hands.  I wonder when he is going to sell it on ebay.  It would be interesting to see if it actually went for anything.  Wouldn't it be neat to have a real tardis to travel through space and time.  T.A.R.D.I.S stands for Time and Relative Dimensions in Space.  If I had one just like the Doctor's I would have to redecorate it.  Of course I would probably get lost in the many chambers it has.  Isn't it neat to daydream?

      Two minds, one soul, is an old saying, that proves too true.  Different opinions, different ways, sometimes causes  turbulance and pain.  Sometimes yelling, sometimes fighting, keep a calm mind, keep a calm discussion  Sometimes you do things that hurt me terribly, I lash out to make you see, what you did to me.  Only love can hurt, don't you see, what you did to me, crying my heart out.  You grab me, scaring me, with your violence only to prove,  you love me  Never lie to me. Never betray me. For I will find out, Don't you see. Don't you see.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      To my dear  everlasting love,  I love you with all of my heart and soul.   You are a friend in times of need, a lover when I need you most, a provider for your family, a husband to keep me safe, a father for your adoring baby, a man for the woman in me, an adviser  when I need advice, my rock when I need strength, my tree when I need roots, my wizard when I need magic, my jester when I need a laugh, my future when I need hope, and my dream when I am asleep.  You are my everything.  When times  get tough, and  you had enough, please remember these words I say to you:  I pledge to you as on our wedding day my living and dying, I shield your back as you would mine, your name is the name I cry in the night,  and your eyes  I smile into in the morning  I pledge to you the first of my meat  and my drink the honeycomb  will taste sweeter, coming from my fingers.  I shall not disparage you nor you me,  and I shall honor you above all others, telling no strangers of our quarrels.  In times of heated discussion, I will try to hold my temper, as I hope you will too.  This is our vow to each other forevermore.  Always my love,  my darling.

      A memory, a meeting of souls, the first time we met.  the first time our eyes touched, is the happiest moment, that I'll never forget.  We wrapped our arms around each other tight, happy to be together, at four in the morning.  Watching the sun rise, over the blue lake, touching each other, not a dream, but reality.  You proposed to me and I said yes. The happiest decision  I'll never forget that one first sight.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      Silently, flitting from tree to tree, a shadowed form quickly moving through the forest.  The hunters crashing, breaking not far behind him with the baying of the hounds.  He slowed and crouched for a moment, his feline green eyes glancing behind him as his pointed ears listened closely to the sounds.  A stick broke and the birds took off from the treetops overhead.  His slender form rose quickly as he raced perpendicular from the way he just came.  His graceful moves clearly showing he wasn't human in any sense of the word.  An elf is the only possible solution to his heritage.  The birds continued to chirp as he passed silently and quickly only to be quieted as the hunters continued to trail him.  In no possible terms did he regret his mission and yet it has been filled with conflict and strife.  He only wanted to find the remaining elves for he could not believe he is the last of his kind.  But if the elves had been hunted like he is being hunted then he had few doubts that many survived.   All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      The tears have gone from my cheeks, my sad-filled eyes  finally seek, my heart still hurts and my soul still yearns, I shall move on, a shadow of my former self, looking back  with happy fondness of a love  never to be forgotten.  shuffling through  material things here I find a lonely sealed letter.  how could I have missed this one letter of love and yet here it is  like a sign from above. with shaking fingers do I open  pull out the sheet and finally read:  my sweet love, my dearest love, I am the luckiest to have you  and yet if you are reading this I know I am gone but know this I am and will always be with you my only love forevermore  clutching the letter to my breast tears fill my eyes glad for this last morsel of love and regret.

      Wake up to a baby's cry,  Run for a bottle with sleep filled-eyes, Maybe catch a few z's, If only baby would sleep with ease.  Hurry get the bags packed, God sometimes I feel like a yak, With bag on shoulder, and baby in arm, Run out the door with no yarn.  Drop baby at sitter's, And calm the motherly jitters, Rush to class, To be an ass.  Rush home, a husband to awake,  Drop him off at work for his sake, Rush back to class, To only be last.  Get the child, Cranky and wild, Later a husband to get, And maybe I'll finally sit.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      She walks to school with the lunch she packed Nobody knows what she's holdin' back Wearin' the same dress she wore yesterday She hides the bruises with linen and lace  The teacher wonders but she doesn't ask It's hard to see the pain behind the mask Bearing the burden of a secret storm Sometimes she wishes she was never born  Through the wind and the rain She stands hard as a stone In a world that she can't rise above But her dreams give her wings And she flies to a place where she's loved Concrete angel  Somebody cries in the middle of the night The neighbors hear, but they turn out the lights A fragile soul caught in the hands of fate When morning comes it'll be too late  [Repeat Chorus]  A statue stands in a shaded place An angel girl with an upturned face A name is written on a polished rock A broken heart that the world forgot  [Repeat Chorus]  -------------------------------------------------------------------------- Great song with a sad realistic twist of life.  It's really sad to think that this could really happen and does happen to young people every day.  In this song the girl is asking for help with her silence from the teacher and the neighbors but everyone minded their own business and doesn't become involved even with someone in so much pain and suffereing.  The song evokes many images with it's soul-wrenching lyrics.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      The beginning and the end, The new and the old, The light and the dark.  Birth and death, Summer and winter, Seasons come, seasons go, Time never changes.  Time is relative, Earth is continuous, Life is about change.  A mother has a baby, A new cycle of life begins, As a grandmother dies, and ends an old life cycle.  It's hard to think, It's hard to feel, I just want to be me, and yet, I can't go back.  Time has changed me, For the better or the worse, Only I can  know.  I dream of times gone by, and times yet to come, I wish, I wish, I wish.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

       urlLink http://www.draconian.com/home/frameset.htm  Here is an excellent site about dragons.  I love this site because well I love dragons.  It has great information about the dragons and it's not a bad looking site though I would probably change a little to make it more exciting but that is just me.   The web designer is always adding new and fun things about dragons which is a wonderful reason to always return to see what's new.

       urlLink http://www.magnatune.com   This is a very interesting site.  The music is interesting and very insightful.  This site is a recording studio interested in providing a better way for musicians to play their music by posting their songs on the internet.  The user may listen to the music and if the user wants, pay the recording studio anywhere from $5 to $18 for the music.  Then the user may download the music to their PC for their listening entertainment. The recording studio also offers Shoutcast for winamp.  The website is very well designed and the idea has merit.  So far I have listened to Beth Quist and the music is excellent.  She composes New Age/World music which makes a very interesting sound.  Les Filles de Sainte-Colombe with viol & harpsichord music for the classical genre.  This is very relaxing.  spineCar playing heavy modern rock is metal through and through.  I recommend this music to anyone who wants something different and something a little cheaper than the music they sell today.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      "That wasn't a question."  The stranger said quietly stopping Truan in his footsteps.  He moved closer to Truan, leaving three feet of space between them.    Truan felt goosebumps on his neck and arms.  This spectre of darkness did not leave much to his imagination.  He didn't go by the name of Truan for a long time.  His street name has long since been Shadow when he first learned to steal for a living.  He positioned his body slowly for a quick dash down the alley in which he came.   "Who are you to keep calling me Truan?"    "A friend of a friend.  Actually he is your relative, an uncle I presume."  The stranger replied quietly once more as if the language was either too simple for his taste or a second language.    Truan guessed both since anything could be possible at this point.  An uncle?  It couldn't be Lieth, could it?  He took a closer look at the messenger.  How could he trust someone or something when it won't show itself to him?  "How do I know you are telling me the truth?"  "Actually you don't.  The only way you will know I speak the truth is to come with me right now to a place where your uncle waits.  That, of course, is up to you.  I can assure you that no harm will befall you while you are in my company."  The dark spectre made a grand gesture further down the alley.  "I will start walking while you make up your mind to follow."    Truan watched him leave.  Should he follow or should he not.  This could be a chance to see his uncle after ten years or so.   Without further thought, Truan found his feet following after.  He only hoped his feet didn't lead him into trouble but that of course would be nothing new.

      "Branwen, lend me your power, of beauty and love this midnight hour. Give me a moment of your time, for this request of mine. Give me beauty, give me love, let me fly like a dove. My goddess, lend me your power, of beauty and love this midnight hour."  She raised her slender arms towards the stormy skies above, chanting the litany three times three.  Her dark hair blowing like a flag within the wind.  Her heart pounding as her breast rose and fell heavily with each rasping breath.  She was so tired of being alone without someone who loved her and only her.  Who could treat her as a queen but also as a person instead of someone to avoid as a witch.  She wanted to feel like a woman if only once in her lifetime.  She had dreams of loving a man, being with a man almost every night. She hated waking up every morning with tears on her pillow and no phantom lover sleeping beside her.  Maybe she looked to plain to the men and that is the reason none of them ever looked her way.  Not every man could know that she is a witch and avoid her altogether.  That wasn't possible.  There has to be a reason why she was completely and utterly alone when all the other women had someone to love them completely.  It wasn't fair or at least that is how she felt day after day.  She could see the couples walking through the town holding hands, whispering to each other, and kissing one another when they didn't think anyone was watching.  She felt her heart yearn for a moment like that until finally she had to do something about it.    The lightning flashed upon her finely sculptured face, her gleaning green eyes glowing with an inner fire.  She could feel Branwen answering her plea.  She could feel her power coursing through her veins.  She would finally get a chance to live to feel normal.  Yes!  She threw her head back in estasy, her robes billowing behind her, revealing the outline of her slender, curvy body.       All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      The moon rose high into the night sky.  It shown brightly enough for the elves to see the ground not that they couldn't see it anyways with their night eyes.  It is the first full moon of the spring.  Time for the celecbration to bring in the summer and everything that goes with that responsibility.  The elves thrive on challenges especially the caring of the trees, plants, flowers, and animal life.  Of course it was getting harder and harder with the meddling of humans always in the way and always going about their business when it wasn't their business!    Timp chuckled over that thought as he settled back against a tree and waited for the festival to begin.  This is the best time of the year when the elves could gather, eat and dance the night away under a bright full moon with the crickets saranating.  It was a wonderful feeling to be united once a year.  He glanced over at the elven maidens across the clearing.  Such beauty in the face of such a challenge this world brings to the elves.  He wondered which beauty might be interested in him.  He sighed.  He should be realistic.  Beauties such as these are never interested in him because he wasn't really a wonder worker.  He was just a watcher.  His job is to watch the humans and to learn as much as possible of their movements and their characters.  When he would find a human who might be a likely candidate to help the elves, he would return with the information for another elf to act in his stead.    He swept his golden brown hair back over his shoulder and leaned against the tree, crossing his feet at the ankles.  His golden eyes wandered over the crowds noticing the different elven clans that had gathered this year.  Even though most clans joined in the celebration, he knew that some never joined or chose not to join due to some inner family politic.    He noticed that the GreenLeafs and the BlueWaters clans had not arrived this year.  It was probably due to the heirs marrying someone else last year instead of marrying each other.  He heard that their excuse was that they didn't love each other so the clans blamed the other for this horrific consequence.    He shook his head.  What utter nonsense, he mused.  From watching the humans, he gathered much information in their interactions.  He agreed with some and others, he thought the elves were better but some times he wondered if there was more than what he was seeing.  He never had a chance to actually talk to a human but maybe this year he might.  He raised his eyebrows at that thought.  It might prove an interesting year.

      With his green eyes, he glanced slowly around at the market place full of people buying and selling their wares.  The loud noise, the colorful clothing, all made a wonderful distraction for his profession as a thief.  His lips curled up into a grin as he saw his favorite target out buying supplies.  The cook for the kitchens of the castle was out buying the weekly supplies to feed the king.  He slipped through the crowds pretending to be another shopper on this day of errands.  He worked his way around the cook until he was right behind her and her entourage.  He waited for something to distract her attention from her actions.  He glanced behind and spotted the distraction.  A horse pulling a wagon through the market which is unheard of for the most part because of the crowds blocking the street.  He glanced back at the cook and waited until the rattle and the clip clop caught her attention making her look at the wagon.  There.  She looked.  He ran out from behind her, bumping her, grabbing her money, and running down a crowded alley.  He heard the entourage try to follow but soon there was too many people blocking his escape.  He laughed from the exhiliration of his heist as he continued onto his little hidey-hole which was located so far into the back alleys of the city that only the street waifs could find it.   He rounded the corner of an alley to the entrance of his hidey hole only to find someone already waiting for him.    He could see the stranger wearing a dark cloak that covered both head and body.  He stopped ready to turn around and pretend to be lost when the stranger suddenly turned toward him.    "Truan."  The stranger said quietly in a smooth voice that didn't give away anything about his character.  "Sorry that's not me."  Truan said quickly while back away from the stranger.  He didn't understand how he knew his name but he wasn't going to stay and find out.   All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      Gazing across the windswept lake as the waves crashed into shore, she wandered the pier as the sun slowly dropped beneath the horizon.  She was the lady known as the widow watcher.  She knew that the people didn't say it to be mean but in truth saying it to feel sorry for her.  Every night as the sun dropped from the sky, she would walk the pier, staring out across the lake, looking for her lover.  One day he went out on the lake only to never return at dusk.  He always said he would be back and yet he never returned.  She would never believe he would die and leave her.  She loved him with all her heart and soul.  Tonight was different though.  The search and rescue found the boat smashed up on a beach with no sign of a body.  Her heart finally accepted what her mind already knew, he was gone forever.  She walked to the end of the pier and stopped.  She glanced over her shoulder at the lengthening shadows before taking one more step off the pier.  At night the water is freezing and very deep with the waves crashing against the pier.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      She looked deeply into his hazel eyes, glancing at his thick lips, smiling, she moved closer.  Touching her lips to his, she gently nibbled on his bottom lip.  He groaned, pulling her closer to his body, holding her closely.  She moaned quietly in the back of her throat as she tightened her arms around his neck, wanting him, wanting more.  She loved the taste of his mouth on hers, the feel of his hands roaming her body, the feel of his body pressed tightly into hers.  She never wanted this night to stop.  She wanted to stay right here in his arms forever and a day.  She thanked the goddesses everyday for the love of her life.  She knew he was her soulmate traveling through the years always finding each other each generation.  He thrust his tongue into her mouth, claiming her heart and soul.  She yearned for his touch, his kiss.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      Brushing her hair slowly in front of the mirror as she sifted through her memories.  Her long brown hair shimmered with red highlights in front of the fire light.  With a small smile resting upon her lips as she remembered the first time she ever had a infatuation with a man.  It was so long ago.  A man who was more a boy pretending to be a man.  She wondered if he still thought of her fondly as she thought of him.  It was only a few years later that she met the love of her life.  Her finely wrought features brightened as she thought of her lover.  He is so wonderful and fulfilling.  Her smile grew sensually as her thoughts moved to the night.  He would come and make windfall sweet blissful love to her tonight.  She would love him with her hands, mouth, and body until he would never want to leave.  She loved his wild hair and how it would never straighten and his big shoulders and arms that hold her, oh, so tight.  His thick lips drove her to erotic dreams of him tasting her, delving deeply inside her, so hot and insistent.  She could feel herself slowly getting wet as her thoughts grew more imaginative of his lovingness.  She grew restless with anticipation, wondering how much longer he would be until she could enjoy his charms.  She turned her hazel eyes toward the door hoping the noise she heard was him coming up the stairs.  A knock sounded at the door.  "Come."  A servant girl appeared, curtsying before delivering her message.  "A soldier below stairs has said Master Wil is dead, milady."  The servant girl left quickly after that bit of news.  She dropped her brush until the floor as she stood up in shock.  How could this be?  He was just here last night in her bed.  She felt her heart pound and slowly break into a thousand pieces.  She could not believe this news.  It could not be possible.  She heard a wagon in the court yard below her tower room.  She hurried over and looked down.  There he was wrapped in his cape and colors lying still in the wagon.  No thoughts ran through her mind as she stepped onto the window ledge.  With no thoughts of herself as she slowly left herself slipped from the tower ledge to fall into the courtyard below to be with her love.  Her heart would stop hurting and she would be at peace to be with him for eternity.    Her body crashed on top of the wagon beside his.  She died on contact.  The servants buried them together in the same grave, knowing that they would never part in life or in death forevermore.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      A wracking cough shook her frame as she settled deeper into her bed and blankets.  She glanced into the flames in the fireplace between her feet.  She can't remember the last time when she was well enough to go outside to walk through the grass and flowers.  She felt her mood deepen further into depression and despair.  There was no end to the coughing and spitting up.  Every muscle in her body ached and she could feel herself wasting away as each day went by.  The village doctor did everything possible for her to no visible effect except that she worsened everyday.  Soon she would fall asleep and fall into a dream in which she would never wake.  It was no longer a bad thought but a good one filled with no pain and lots of rest.  She lifted a frail, shaking hand to push her tangled, greasy hair away from her face.  She closed her tired blue eyes, took a deep breath, and drifted off to sleep.  Her chest rose and fell for a last time as her spirit finally found release from its weak vessel to rise up and beyond all earthly wants and needs.

      The wind whipped her cold, wet hair into face as she stood in the tallest tower, looking into the grey sky.  She raised her arms toward the heavens and closed her hazel eyes to recite a spell.    "Brigit, lend your power, At this noon day hour, To protect my abode, From the things I loathe, Change their minds, To give them time, To change their ways, Heed what I say."  Repeating her spell three times, concentration marring her forehead.  Her dark hair whipped faster as the storm moved closer.  Lightning flashed illuminating the features of the house and thunder shook the tower.  Her slender form buffeted by the wind as the litany grew ever louder into a crescendo.  Just as suddenly as it started, it was over.  Her shoulders slumped as she slowly opened her eyes, blinking away the rain.  Glancing down at the ground, moving her eyes slowly towards the town located seven miles away.  Weary, she moved slowly to the stairs and made her way down to the door that led into the attic of the house.  She hoped that would keep her and her family safe for a little while until she can find a better way to do it.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      Click. Click. Clickity, click click. Click. He typed quickly upon his keyboard while watchin the screen for any errors.  He wanted it to be absolutely perfect.  He clicked the save and print buttons.  He wanted a minute.  He stood up and stretched, reaching for the sky as high as possible.  He reached over to the printer on the right, sitting on a small table below the window.  He took the hard copy out and glanced over it.  He heard his watch beep and looked up at the wall clock.  It was time to go.  He glanced at the paper again.  Damn!  There was a mistake.  No, two mistakes.  He crumbled up the paper into a tight ball and filed it in file thirteen.  He grabbed his stuff and ran out the door.  He would just have to finish it the next morning.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      A burst of pure emotion burst inside of her.  She was giddy with excitement, exhilarated beyond reasoning.  She didn't care what people through of her as she skipped down the street.  Who cares if a twenty-three year old skips or jumps.  They are just envious that she is happy and they aren't.  My, that was cruel to think, she giggled to herself.  Nothing could ruin this moment.  Time could stop down and she would still be happy.    She had in her hands the reason for her life.  The ultimate goal in which she had planned all her life.  A treasure chest, a jewel, a gold coin.  Joy coursed through her veins and nothing was going to stop it.  The day will go down in history as the day that made her so happy that she rejoiced with all of her heart, body, and soul.  And in less than eight months, she would have a baby boy or girl.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      He whispered words of love into her ears.  She moaned, the sound and the breath from his mouth tingled through her body.  She yearned for his knowing touch.  She could feel him against her thigh.  She arched her back, moving her thigh against him.  He ran his hands over her body, over her breasts, slapping her buttocks.  She groaned, wanting more, needing more.  She bit him gently with her teeth.  He slid his fingers through her parted legs, feeling her curly hair.  She grabbed onto him as if to hold on tight as she gasped.  She loved him so much.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      A time comes within everyone's life in which they must make a decision.  A decision based on nothing, no fact or emotion.  Or at least I thought there was no emotion involved.  I had to make such a decision and the consequences that followed that choice is what makes this tale very unique.  Or at least so I thought.    My name is Lizzy and I was born just like everyone else.  I had parents, relatives, a house, a dog, even a wayward cat just like everyone else.  Normal I tell you, my family was completely normal. I went to school, got average grades.  I wasn't a genius but then again I never tried.  Maybe if I tried harder, things would have been different.     I worked when I was old enough to make a little extra cash to buy the things I wanted.  Of course my parents said that since I was working I could buy my own clothes which didn't seem to fair to me.  I didn't make a fuss though.    I had two older brothers whom did what they pleased.  As soon as they were allowed to ride their bike past the block, they were never home.  I guess they pretty much stayed out of trouble.  I can't remember any rebellious antics that exploded through the family.  There were four years between each of us I guess to keep mom sane as she raised us.  I don't think I ever want to have children after being a child myself.  I know how hard it is to raise children and how much misery they seem to bring growing up.    Of course that was a childish thought.  It seems with the right man anything is possible even children.    Before I get a head of myself I need to explain the how and why of everything before the decision.   I just graduated from school.  I didn't know what to do with my life so I thought I would try another town maybe another life out before making kind of decision.  I thought about college but just the idea of being cooped up for four more years didn't excite me at all.   I got a small place in the next town and got a job waitressing.  After all I didn't want to move too far away from home just in case.    Waitressing isn't all that exciting either but sometimes meeting a certain person just made it all worthwhile.  Some people were just so interesting and so unusual that it is a unique experience to hold a conversation with them.  The tips are good but it sure did make my feet hurt at the end of the shift.

      I gazed into her deep brown eyes. I realized I saw a woman who had a hard life with many secrets and many regrets.  Her eyes spoke of a time of great joy but also a time with great misery and hardship.  A woman who knew the value of a word and yet knew nothing of living a happy life filled with joy and laughter.  I could see the laughter lines on her face and yet I realized how old they must have been for this woman no longer laughed at the joy of living.  I realized I pitied this woman.  I also realized that I could be this woman in the future.  With a few bad choices, it would be so easy for me to turn into her.  I didn't want that but yet I realized this woman never wanted that.  What could have happened in this woman's life to cause her so much pain.  Then it came to me.  It had to be love.  Love is the only power on this earth to cause this much pain and yet still have joy in a few moments between the pain.  Would I have the strength to do what this woman did not do or would I freeze before making a decision.  I hope such a decision never befalls me.  I slowly closed the door of the dark brown casket on the woman, barely thirty, who died by her husband's angry hand.  A senseless death indeed.

      His anger roared throughout the room as his wrath grew stronger.  He yelled at her as she cringed.  He stomped over and slammed her up against the wall.  She tripped onto the floor.  Still yelling, he savagely kicked her over and over.  She curled up into a ball in such shock that this could be happening to her.  She never knew this side of him until now.  Their marriage so new and yet so horrible.  If only she could get up, she could maybe stop him by fighting back.  He stopped for a few seconds, long enough for her to stand.  He slammed her back to the floor to kick her again and again.  The tears would not come but the fear strangled her.  She didn't understand how this could happen to her.  How she could choose a man who would be abusive to her.  She could never trust him again for fear of raising his anger towards her.  Her innocence broken forever that someone could hurt her in this manner.  She always thought she would be safe and protected in this world.  She was wrong.  Finally he stopped.  She stood up slowly to make sure he wouldn't just knock her down once more.  He was quiet.  She sidled past him and rushed to the bathroom.  She just wanted to hide in a small hole forever.  Not only was this hurtful, it was also shameful and embarrassing to be a victim of physical violence.  She realized that she couldn't talk to anyone about this for they would get angry in her defense and wonder why she wouldn't leave him.  But she loved him though the reasons are getting thin.  She didn't think he realized how much she loved him and yet how he was killing her slowly.  She prayed to whomever was listening to help her but she knew no one would.  She also knew it would happen again one day.  Will she be strong enough?  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      He watched the burning sky with it's bright reds, oranges, and pinks.  The calm evening suggested a calm ending but it was entirely wrong.  A flock of v-flying geese flew away from the burning fire towards the darkness.  As time moved on slowly so did the fire die down.  Soon the glamour would be gone for another day at another time.  He sighed.  He wished he could be home.  He took one last glance before heading back to his responsibilities.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      The man, thing, whatever led him back through the alleys toward the East end of town.  The East end of town was filled with taverns, brothels, and clientele who match that description.  He stopped and looked around before climbing the backstairs of one of the taverns.  Truan guessed it was the Red Bull but he wasn't sure since most taverns looked the same from behind.    Truan climbed the stairs quckly and quietly.  He didn't trust him not to lead him into trouble.  The King's guards have wanted him for a long time and he wasn't about to be handed over like a gift-wrapped horse.    "This way.  Your uncle is in the last door by the stairs on your right.  I will stay here and guard the doors."  The dark spectre waved toward the said door.    Truan approached quietly, glancing up the hallway and behind him.  The place lacked lights which created many shadows for which Truan was very grateful.  He knocked quietly on the door.  Suddenly it opened.  A hand reached out, grabbed his shirt and pulled him in, closing the door behind him.  Truan felt crushed against a large chest in a large bear hug.  "Come, Come.  Sit, have a drink."  A deep growl said.  Truan was suddenly let go and pushed towards a chair.   He glanced over his shoulder at the big burly man.  It must have been a long time because he didn't remember his uncle looking like that or even that tall.  Truan sat down on the edge of his seat, ready to run for the door or for the window which ever way was clear.    "You might not remember me.  It's been at least ten years since I saw you.  I remember you was about six when I last visited the castle.   I, of course was heartbroken to hear about your father and mother.  I loved them both dearly.  Of course I felt even worse when I heard that you also was killed.  It wasn't until a month ago that I heard differently from a letter sent to me by some woman named Martha Wettle.  Of course I rushed back to the city to see if I could still locate you that you was still alive in the streets."  the big burly man sat down and poured himself a drink from a pitcher on the table.    For that matter the room was sparce.  A bed against the far wall opposite the door and a table with two chairs  in the middle of the room was all that decorated the room.  Truan studied the man to see if he found anything he recognized.  He remembered his uncle had green eyes and so did this man.  He could vaguely remember that his uncle was tall with dark hair the same as this man.  He didn't know what to believe at this time.    "I know that you don't trust me.  You probably don't remember much of me but let me see if I can tell you a few things that only a member of the family would know."  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      Bardric searched until his eyes felt like sandpaper and he still looked. Too many forests could hide the prize they were looking for but they didn't give up. Sooner or later something had to show itself.   "Do you see anything?" Bardric yelled in hopes that something showed up.  "Not yet but they could be hiding in the trees. Wait. What is that over there?" Trellian turned a hard right almost upsetting the wizard into free flight.   The wizard grabbed hold and looked where the dragon had turned. Billows of smoke appeared from the trees like a forest fire. They circled closer to the smoke but couldn't make out anything. The smoke teared their eyes which made them turn away and to try again from another direction.   "What is that smell?" The wizard yelled as he wiped his eyes on his sleeve.  "I am not sure. I could hazard a few guesses but I would rather not at this point." The dragon hollered back as he circled around the smoke.

      The wizard dropped another coin onto the bar and left the tavern. He looked more closely at the town and noticed the empty houses. He hurried out of town before anyone took a special interest in his activities and followed. He called for the dragon as he entered the meadow.   Trellian landed a few minutes later. "So did you find what you were looking for here?"  "I am not sure. The barkeeper I spoke to told me about some rumors of Drakken and some guards from Zorlock and something about the elves and dwarves raising arms but he didn't specify against whom. There are a lot of empty houses in town but where have the people gone?" Bardric scratched his chin.  "Drakken?" The dragon said suddenly.  "Yes that is what he said."  "The Drakken are hideous creatures that the gods should never have made. There is no reason for them to live here. They cause chaos and bloodshed. They should definitely not be here because they were banished from these lands." Trellian hissed as smoke streamed out of his nostrils.  "I see you know some history of these Drakken." Bardric cautiously walked closer to the dragon.  "Yes I do. I helped banished them the first time and now it looks like I am still around to do it again. We must make sure that they are here first before being hasty." The dragon moved into position for the wizard to climb on. "We will search the area thoroughly."

      A thousand needles pierced her heart as she realized what he did.  He actually did it on purpose to teach her a lesson only it backfired on him.  She didn't know if she could ever trust or even love him the way she did at the beginning.  There just seemed to be so much heartache and pain.  She didn't know if she could go on living like this.  Was it really worth the pain?  She didn't feel that it was.  She did love him, God help her.  But the pain is too much for her to handle anymore.  Could she go on alone without him?  She might just find out soon if she could.  She used to be independent of everyone and anything.  Strange how that changed when she fell in love with him.  it is of no matter though.  She could live on her own if she must.  It shouldn't be that hard.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      Bardric came to the edge of town slowly and cautiously. Until he was sure what sort of situation he was talking into he would take all the precautions possible. He noticed that the town was awfully quiet for being morning. Where are the children? He walked slowly towards the tavern located in the center of town. He noticed that most of the houses and business had their windows closed or boarded up. The town also had a run down look of not being taken care of lately. He paused outside the tavern and took a quick look around before entering.   The tavern had the usual dark, gloomy look inside. There were few people inside drinking and eating at the surrounding tables. The barkeeper cleaned the bar at the far wall. A fireplace on the left had a fire with a spit cooking poultry which lighted up some of the room. It was a very cheerless place.  The wizard walked up to the bar and sat down on a stool in front of the barkeeper. "Tell me, friend, what news and give me a drink." The wizard laid some coins on the bar.   The barkeeper filled a tankard and sloshed it in front of the wizard. "The news around these parts are that there is fighting from here to Klaken on the road, armed guards ride through town at least once a day, and people are leaving."  "Do you know who is doing this?" The wizard asked as he sipped the ale from the noticeably dirty glass.   "There are rumors that the Drakken are back or that the guards are from Zorlock. Plus there are stories of elves and dwarves packing up to go to war. Truthfully I don't know and I don't ask any questions especially if it means losing my head. Now if I was you, I would head out of town before someone notices that you are asking a lot of questions." With that the barkeeper took the tankard away and dumped it out. He walked to the other end of the bar and started cleaning once more.

      The dragon gently lowered himself to the ground to let the wizard off and be on his way. The area around the large meadow was mostly woods for the most part. Tintown laid in the southern direction. It would hardly be proper for a dragon to land in town without permission and a dragon always try to be proper.   "I think I'll stick around here for a few days so if you need me, just come to this meadow and call me." Trellian said as he watched the wizard gather up his pack and sling it across his shoulder.   "I'll remember that. You take care of yourself and I hope to see you again." Bardric raised his staff in farewell before heading into the woods toward Tintown.  "You take care too, old friend. There are many evils alive in the lands these days." The dragon said as he turned toward eastern mountains to continue his napping.  Bardric smiled as he heard the dragon take off. They've been friends for an awfully long time ever since he walked up to him to have a conversation. But first things first, he must find out what all the trouble is lately.

      She yearned for his touch and for his love.  His touch felt like heaven and his love empowered her with happiness.  But sometimes it seems that he would rather be alone or ignore her.  She doesn't understand his reactions.  She just wanted a little attention and yet it seems that he is too busy to give her any.  Maybe too busy with his own affairs.  Could she be selfish or is he self-absorbed with himself?  All she knew at this moment that she wasn't fulfilled or satisfied.  She was lonely and tired.  She just wanted a little bit company.  Is that too much to ask of him?  Maybe it was.  She would probably never know for sure.  Happiness is of the moment and yet in order to stay together it must be forever or else she would find someone who would give her attention and happiness.

      Bardric hopped up on the Trellian's back and held on tight. The dragon jumped into the air and his wings whooshed through the air. The wizard enjoyed the view below of tiny villages and towns. He knew the dragon didn't mind giving him a ride. They have been friends for such a long time.   "Where exactly did you want to go?" Trellian called back as he flew through some low lying clouds.  Bardric wiped off his face and considered. "I guess drop me off at Tintown. I heard the most turmoil lies in that direction." The wizard yelled back hoping the air didn't blow his words away.  "Tintown it is. That is such a strange place to be though. No one could ever tell me why they called it Tintown to begin with. Then again every time someone sees me, they seem to scream and run away. Strange." The dragon replied as he changed directions to head towards Tintown.   "Maybe they thought they would have to feed you." Bardric yelled as he clutched his pack a little tighter as the dragon swooped towards the ground.  "Like I said, strange." Trellian flew just above treetops as he looked for the telltale signs of Tintown. Of course he was also scaring away all of the folk in that area.

      The next morning the dragon yawned and stretched slowly. The cracking of joints sounded loud in the quiet morning.   "Well it's about time you wake up." The wizard sat on the same rock whittling away at a small block of wood.  "I should eat you for breakfast and go right back to sleep." Trellian yawned again.  "I don't taste good and you know it. Come on time is a wasting. The faster you drop me off the faster you can get back to sleeping." Bardric tucked the wood away and pick up his traveling pack.

      "Well why do you always go around as a dragon, Trellian?" Bardric asked with a quirk. The dragon answered with a hiss as his tongue flicked the air in front of the wizard.   Bardric chuckled in response. "So have you heard about the turmoil to the south?" The wizard changed the subject.  "There's always turmoil to the south. Which do you mean in particular?" Trellian asked as he closed his eyes dreamily.  "Well, from what I hear there is a problem between man and elves and dwarves. For some odd reason that no one knows about, they decided to wake up one morning and hate each other. Maybe it's the water." The wizard mused as he shifted his weight on his rock.  "You always say it's the water whenever something strange happens. It has never been the water." The dragon said quickly as he shook his head slowly. "But what would cause that must strife in one area. Sure I can understand a small problem with a family or something but not what you just described."  "I did hear a few rumors that a Halfling traveled through the lands right before everything blew up. I am not sure if that had anything to do with it or if it is just coincidence." Bardric hummed slightly to himself as he thought about what he just said.  "Well why don't you just go down and find out, old wizard and let me to my sun." Trellian said quickly.  "Actually I am but I was wondering if you could just fly me down. I really don't feel like walking or riding all that way. My bones aren't what they used to be." The wizard said plaintively while trying to look old.  Trellian snorted. "I might as well or else you'll just stay here and badger me. We'll start out in the morning so let me have my nap so I can be rested." The dragon curled his head on top of his forelegs.  Bardric grinned as he walked back to his camp.

      "So tell me ole boy, how long have you roamed the earth?" The wizard named Bardric asked his old friend. He wore a blue robe and blue hat that is very typical of a wizard at least in the stories at any rate.  "Far longer than you can count you faker. Why do you wear such silly clothes? Are you broadcasting that you are a wizard?" He snorted letting a flame lick out his nose. He raised a scaly eyebrow as he turned his head to look at his friend. He gleamed in the sun as he laid fully flat on the ground his tail twitching every so often.

      The sky raged that night with lightening flashing the sky and the thunder rumbling a constant roar.  The darkness was deep only to be broken with the lightening.  He watched the spectacle from the safetly of his cave.  There was such power tonight.  It could only be magic for this sort of storm at this time of year was unheard of.  He pushed his hair back behind his pointed ears.  Many would not believe that such as he existed since his people tend to not make many appearances in the land of man.  But he was on a mission of some great import.  The elves have felt some sort of magic in the lands of the north and it was his duty to find out who and why.  Such magic is dangerous especially weather magic.  It could throw an entire ecosystem out of phase which could cause flooding, droughts, blizzards among some of the worse scenarios in other lands.  He smoothed his leather shirt and straighten his pants before going back inside to his warm fire.  His mission was one of secrecy since no one must know that he was here.  Among his people he was considered a warrior and a wizard with an unusual sense of peace that filled his life.  He hated violence and yet it seemed that he could never escape.  He hoped this mission could be completed quickly so he can return home and to peace.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      She felt the dread rise within her like an ocean wave washed up on the sand.  She could feel the frustration filling her insides.  Tears welled up within her hazel eyes and her head pound with a throbbing pain.  With her whole being she felt the solitude and the isolation of being a woman.  Failure floated within her mind as she tried to come to some sort of solution.  A solution or at the very least the answer to the answer why.  Why is life treating her this way is an age old question that feels everyone's mind at least one within a lifetime.  Still this question has plagued her since the day she was born.  There was still no answer.  With her entire being she could feel the hurt and the pain.  She tried to find some sort of answer for this and yet she could not.  Of course she tried the usual journals, meditations, or even yoga.  Nothing seemed to work.  She just was not happy with her life.  But what could she do?  Change?  How?  There was no way she could change her life.  But maybe she was exaggerating everything.  Maybe she was imagining the problems and the irritations.  Maybe she was imagining the raising voice as she tried to talk about a problem.  Does it really matter?  Does it matter at all?  Maybe not.  She would stay until she wasn't needed anymore or at the very least until she was no longer sane.  That might be sooner than later.  She shrugged at that thought.

      She smiled.  It was a smile filled with memories, woman intution, womanly wisdom, and love.  She slowly brushed her hair while she looked at herself in the mirror.  Her hazel eyes sparkled with a warmth that normally isn't there.  Her flowed down her back with a bright reddish sheen in the candlelight.  She wasn't really looking at herself but through the mirror into a world long ago.    Her warrior.  A man filled with vitality and strength but also a loving hand.  He could kiss the thoughts right out of her mind.  She yearned still for his touch, his kiss, the feel of his body against hers.  She remembered the last time.  It was so filled with passion and love that the room smelled of it for days afterwards.   She wished he never had left her.  Now she would forever be warmed only be memories but still be cold from his lack of touch.  She laid the brush down slowly.  she covered her face with her hands and wept.  Never would she love again for she had known love and nothing else could ever compare.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      The surge of soldier poured out onto the field.  Their voices raised in anger and defiance.  Their foes settled in to wait for the charge.  Numbered at least four to one, the soldiers charged on with hope still left in their beating hearts.  And yet they knew they might not survive this battle but they still had to go on to protect their lands, families, and honor.  There was no hope for these soldiers to come out unscathed.  Most will die and some might survive to continue the fight for another day.  Still they rumbled across the brown field, their swords, lances, maces raised and their sheilds held high.  Shining armor flashed in the waning sun as if a warning to their foes that they won't give up.  The sun hid behind the clouds as if afraid to witness such a extraordinary event happening below.  Drums echo across the plains from both sides creating a thundering effect.    The soldiers crashed into the main horde of foes sweeping through the middle into the center of the fray.  Slowly a gulf of soldiers brutally cut, slashed their way through towards the castle, standing high at the other end of the field.  With their prize so close and yet so far away as the swarm of orcs kept coming.  There was too many to kill or even hold back for very long.  The King blew his horn to return the soldiers to him to regroup for a final stand.   The horn blasted to the four corners of the battle.  Soldiers vainly fought to return to their soverienty's side.  The King blew his horn again and again.  Finally he blew and led a new charge towards the castle killing orcs left and right.    A new thunder raged across the battle.  Lightening lit up the sky.  Thunder crashed again and again.  Finally rain poured down cleaning the earth.  Blood swirled in puddles of water before soaking into the earth.  The horses slipped under the weight of their riders in the mud and the muck.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      She whispered the spell gently under her breath as she walked around the circle times three.   She slowly gripped the dagger and sliced the palm of her hand to let the blood drip into the circle.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      She whispered sweet words of love into his ear.  Running her fingers down her back slowly, she snuggled closer to his hot body.  She could feel every inch of him against her.  It was sweet bliss.  She sighed as she rested her head against his shoulder.  Her fingers played on top of his chest, running her fingers through his dark hair.  She gently kissed him on the cheek.  Nuzzling against his neck, she nibbled gently tasting his salty skin.   She felt as if she was in heaven with his arms wrapped tightly around her.  Safe.  Loved.  Cherished.  Treasured.

      Back in her office, she took the head gear off and took a sip of her now cold tea.  She wrinkled her nose and set down the cup down on the desk.  She brought up the files and looked closely at them.  As far as she could tell the Genesis Project had something to do with viral warfare only it's been tested here in the streets.  Interesting.  Maybe not interesting since most of the victims die.  TKS.  She remembered when that particular virus ran rampant through the streets, killing children and elderly as well as a few in the middle.  If she remembered correctly it was raging one day and the next it was over.  She read a little further.  It says that as soon as the test had the results, the company released an antiviral to kill the virus.    She realized that she shouldn't be seeing this document.  She shouldn't have it.  She put the head gear back on and went to the VR club.  Brett was no where in sight.  Quickly she scanned her system and found a foreign object in one of the offices.  She quickly ported herself there.  Brett was there stashing the note.  "Brett."  She said as she entered the office.   "Hey.  That's cheating.  You're not suppose to come after the note until you hacked my system, left a note, and met with me in the club."  He said accusingly.  "I have a problem and we must speak on a secure channel.  Follow me now."  She grabbed his arm and took him to a room she built for herself that only she herself could enter.  "I hacked into your system or at least I thought it was your system.  Brett, I must know.  Do you actually administer all of the Genesis System or do you just administer the public part?"  "I think I just administer the public because I noticed a few systems running into my system and was told to never touch those that they had someone else to administer to those systems.  Why?"  Brett sat down on the sofa watching Kat pace the floor.  "I think I hacked into one of those systems.  I now have information that I shouldn't have and I don't know what to do."  She ran her fingers through her hair and kept pacing.  It seemed the only thing to keep her calm.  "What kind of information?  May I see it."  He asked as he stood in front of her to stop her for a moment.    "Yeah, just let me bring it up."  She walked over to a blank wall and gave a few voiced commands.  Soon the wall was covered with the document.    Brett read quickly through the information.  "Do you know if anyone saw you enter and leave the system?"  "No, I have no idea.  I felt someone coming but I left so I don't think they know who I am but they probably know by now that someone was in that office.   They might be able to trace me.  I don't know."  She ran her fingers through her hair and started to pace again.  "Kat."  Brett quietly said as he watched her pace back and forth.  "You know what you should do, don't you?"  "Leave.  Hide.  Disappear?"  She stopped and looked at him.  "Yes.  I think you should go somewhere where you have never been and hide.  I don't want you to be hurt.  I know what the corporation is capable of.  I found that out a few years ago.  I will take the first flight out of California to join you.  We'll think of something but hold on for now."  Brett said quietly as he pulled her into his arms and held her.    "Wait.  Do you feel that?"  She pushed him away and went to her security systems.  "We have to get out now.  They're coming."  "Who is coming?" Brett rushed over the systems.  "I see the Omikron and Green Genesis logos on those men so I guess we are both in deep shit.  Come, lets go out  the rabbit hole."  She rushed over to the desk and moved it out of the way.  "Rabbit hole?  What?"  Brett confused followed her.  "Alice in Wonderland.  Rabbit hole."  She saw the confusion on his face.  "Nevermind I'll lend you the book later.  Let's go."  She jumped feet first down the hole and back into reality.  Quickly she threw her gear down and grabbed her personal effects that she would need like money and credit cards.  She took the back way out of the building avoiding the elevators and main hallways.  She grabbed the monorail to the next city.   Maybe she should hide in the country but she would look out of place there.  She lived in the city for most of her life.

      Switching off the VR club, she grabbed her hardware and slipped it over her head.  Built like an early twenty-first century virtual reality machine except that the technology was all new.  It was still VR but now it showed the folders on the computer as file cabinets or drawers filled with files that showed up as papers or pictures.  Programs were actually entities such as a sweeper showed in VR as a broom or a cleaner showed up as a mop and bucket.  The Recycle bin or trash on the old computer now shows up as an actual garbage can filled with all the deleted items of the system.  She smiled.  Technology has certainly improved over the years.  It's about time.    She looked closely at his system.  She couldn't see any known holes or cracks in the wall.  Hmm, he is getting better.  A challenge.  She moved slowly closer to the wall.  Being very careful not to trigger any security systems.  It looks like he fixed the hole she found the last time they played the game.  She, of course, knew another way in.  She never played all her cards at once.  Looking closely around to make sure the surveillance was looking in the other direction.  She flew quickly to the right side of the wall.  There.  A key hole.  She grabbed a key from her pocket.  She gave a twist and a door opened.  She moved quickly inside and shut the door.   She shook her head over the flamboyant use of colors and elegance.  What a waste to use technology such as this.    She looked closer at the code that showed up in the walls inside.  The code didn't match the architecture of Brett's system.  She walked down the hallway.  She entered the first office on the right.  Opening up a file cabinet, she glanced at the folders inside.  A name caught her attention.  Genesis Project.  She opened the folder and skimmed the contents.  She felt someone coming through the system.  Quickly she downloaded the information onto her system.  She ducked through the door and back the way she came.  Quickly she opened the backdoor and left the system.      All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      Her avatar sipped from her glass as she glanced at him.  She smiled.  "So I believe it is your turn, my friend.  Do you dare?" She ran her fingers through her long brown hair as she waited for his answer.  Her avatar looked like her real-life self but a little skinnier in certain places.    The virtual reality, VR for short, club they meet in was packed with other avators.  Everyone out looking for a wonderful time away from being their selves.  Music playing loud to create a personal atmosphere.  Avators dancing on the dance floor while others congregated around the bar on the side.  A few sat at the tables in the back where they were sitting alone in a corner to keep everything private.   He smiled.  "Of course I dare.  I am going to place the note so far deep in your system that it will take you a week to find it."  His avatar was tall, dark and handsome unlike his real-life self in which he was a little overweight from sitting and usually dishevelish from not paying attention to his image.  He lived on the west coast in California working for a mojo corporation called Green Genesis.  Even he didn't know anything about the corporation only that it paid him to keep the systems up and running.   "Then let the games begin, my over-confident friend.  Let's see who can place the note first and then lets see who can find the note placed on our systems."  She lived and worked on the east coast.  Pennsylvania to be more precise.  She worked for a corporation called Omikron Logistics.  All she knew that it was some sort of research company that worked with the government sometimes.    She met him about two years ago at a VR convention.  They both had to attend and their tables were placed together so they talked during the slow periods.  They met again in the VR club and started the game to keep things interesting.  Since they both work as system administrators, they keep each other on edge with the game they play.  They hack in each other's system and place a hidden note.  They race to see who is the quickest in hacking and finding the note.  It helps them find holes within their security plus gives them something to do while they work the night shift.     All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      She snuggled closer to his warm body as the cool air touched her body.  A dream tickled her mind keeping her awake.  A dream filled with chaotic images that caused her to wake up from a deep sleep.  She ran her fingers down his back wishing he was awake so she could tell him about her dream.  She smiled as she remembered a few hours earlier loving him.  She pulled the banket tighter as she wrapped her arms around him.  She gently kissed his shoulder.  He definitely was the love of her life.    She closed her eyes and calmed her breathing.  Slowly she placed herself in a favorite room inside her mind.  A calming and soothing place for her troubled mind.  Soon she dozed gently while thinking of her lover.  She squeezed him gently and smiled wishing for a repeat of that evening.

      She rubbed her tired eyes slowly with her fingers.  They felt so scratchy and dry.  She needed to get some sleep.  Worried about bills, work, and many other things, sleep has been the last thing on her mind these last couple of days.  She didn't know when she would get to sleep again.    Running some water into the kettle for a quick cup of tea before she would try to lay down once more.  She doubted she would sleep tonight.  Maybe a movie or a book would do some good.    Suddenly she dropped the kettle on the floor, spilling water all over.  A loud shrill scream fell out of her mouth without her will.  She fell to her knees.  Tears came to her eyes and she cried.  She cried as if her heart was breaking into a thousand pieces.  She huddled upon the floor in a tiny ball of misery.  When would it all stop.  When would all the pain and the misery stop.

      She watched the snow fall gently down upon the ground.  She could feel the flakes melt like stings upon her head.  Wrapping herself tigher, she wished the snow could have waited a little longer.  She didn't mind the snow but sometimes it did cause so many problems.  The snow only had to wait another week or two at the most.  Then it could have snowed ten feet.  She didn't care.  Her pierced through the darkness but still she couldn't see anything.  She waited a little longer.  Finally her shivering wouldn't stop so she decided to go in the warmth and wait.  She hated to wait.  Waiting is the worse thing in the world to do.  There was no more cleaning to do so she wouldn't be able to keep herself busy from thinking.  She sighed as she sat down on the sofa and pulled a blanket on top of her.  She huddled and shivered until she felt warm enough to move once more.  Maybe she should go out a little longer and wait.  All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      She yawned and stretched as she wandered towards the kitchen for a drink.  It was just too early in the morning and yet the sun was peeking through the windows.  It wasn't fair that she had to go to work this early in the morning.  It felt like she just went to bed.  She sighed and wished she could actually sleep at night instead of tossing and turning.    She grabbed a glass and held it under the faucet.  Turned on the cold water and watched it fill.  She turned off the faucet and took a long drink.  How can water be so tastless and still be good for people.  Oh wait that is probably why it is good for people.  Anything tastless is healthy or at least that is what it seems like.    She didn't really want to think of that especially since she was trying to lose a little bit of weight.    She walked into the livingroom and turned on the tv to see the weather.  It looks like the weather will be good today or maybe that means the weather will worsen as the day turned into evening.  Who can tell on the weather maps.  She clicked the tv off.  It doesn't matter.  It is time to get dressed and go to work once again.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      The sound of his horse's hooves pounding upon the sand echo the pounding of his heart as he thought of his love.  She was like the desert.  Her skin the color of sand and her hair the color of wet sand when first touched by the morning sun.  Her lips full and dark like a sand dune at night with the moon shining brightly.  He blinked as he felt his horse slip on loose sand.  He pulled up on the reins slowly the horse until he caught his balance.  He knew he looked like a shadow to anyone who saw him crossing the desert.  His dark horse matched his dark clothing and hair.  He was a true desert nomad.  His desert rose would have the only chance of settling him down for any length of time.  Why else would he be rushing back to her soft golden arms.  He urged his horse on.  His hooves kicking up the sand behind causing a dust cloud that followed behind.    He thought of holding her slender body tightly against his.  She was the only beauty that would ever warm his blood like she.  Even the desert couldn't stir his blood like she.  She was his soul, his life, his heart.  He would die if she ever left him for how could he live without his source of life.    All written material is copyrighted by Crystal - 2003

      "Hey Shari.  Where ya going?"  Ty asked as Shari turned a corner.  "No where."  She answered.  Why did she have to bump into him now?  He was such a pain.  He always made her feel that he was laughing at her.  It made her so uncomfortable to be around him.  "Why don't I walk with you for a while then."  Ty stared walking beside her.  "If you wish."  Shari groaned silently.  She looked at him.  He was a few inches taller than her with blue hair.  Of course he would have to follow the multitudes and dye his hair.  That was so like him.  Mr. Popular.  She shook her head.  "So why are you walking out here in the corridors?"  He combed his fingers through his hair as he looked at her.  "My parents.  They are driving me nuts just because I like to read and spend time in my room.  They seem to think I have no life when I am perfectly happy with mine."  Shari complained.    "Yeah my parents are like that too.  They want me to be a doctor and are dismayed everytime I bring my grades home.  They keep forgetting that I am not quite old enough to be a doctor yet even if I wanted to be one which I don't.  At least not a doctor of their particular fields."  He shook his head.  "I didn't know your parents are pressuring you too.  Why do they do that?  I realize that they are only trying to look our for us but pressure isn't going to help.  It's just going to make us more determined not to be pushed.  Now I have to help out in the labs every day after school starting next week."  Shari sat down on a bench outside of the library.  "You too?  I thought I was the only one."  He sat down beside her.  "I guess we'll be working beside each other doing the exciting task of washing beakers."  He said with a slight tone of sarcasim.  Shari laughed.  "Maybe we can make it a little fun.  Either that or they will throw us out calling us lost causes.  Now that would be nice."  Shari giggled as she said that.    "I don't know.  It really could be fun.  At least it would be different.  We live on a station and there isn't that much to do.  I heard that you read all the time so that probably does entertain you but I don't like to read unless I am really interest in the book so I have lots of time on my hands.  Probably why I am always in trouble."  He grinned at her.  "Yeah I do like to read.  I am also running out of books.  My parents have also threatened to stop buying my books."  Shari sighed.  "I guess we will have to make the most of it.  Well I have to get home before my parents get mad at me.  I really don't want that on top of everything else."  Shari smiled at him and started back the way she came.  She looked back to see him wave from the bench.

      "Well, can he help us?" Trellian asked as Bardric emerged from the tower.  "No, he can't. When he released that spell, all of the magic back lashed on him and completely knocked him senseless. I don't even think he has power anymore." Bardric said sadly as he walked over to the dragon. "I guess we're going to have to find another way."  "I guess so if there isn't any hope for him. Well where to next? I am completely out of ideas." The dragon said slowly.  "Truthfully so am I. I guess we need to alert the people that there is a threat in the lands. That will keep us busy until we can figure out what to do next." Bardric said slowly as he climbed back on the dragon's back.  "Yes that does sound like a plan. Let's go." The dragon took to the air with a whoosh and turned south out of the mountains.

      They landed on the ledge leading up to the tower. No one seemed to around. Bardric held a hand up to his mouth and waved his intention to the dragon. He climbed the stairs quietly. Soon he was outside the tower. He listened closely at the door. He heard something move inside. He pushed the door open slowly.   "Hello." He said as he looked into the dark room.   "Oh my I have visitors. Come in and have some tea. I hardly ever have visitors. Please sit down." A wizard said across the room in the shadows. He appeared quickly with a kettle from the fire and poured a cup of tea. He pulled out a chair for Bardric.   "Oh I see you are a fellow wizard. It's so nice to see wizards now and then. I wish I could get out more but alas I can't. My work keeps me busy. Busy as a beaver." The wizard said with a laugh.   Bardric looked at the wizard's eyes. He didn't seem quite right. The wizard kept shifting his eyes left and right. He sat down where the wizard had motioned and held the cup in his hand. The wizard sat down across from him.  "So where do you hail from?" The wizard asked Bardric.  "From Tintown. Tell me how long have you lived here? You have a nice tower." Bardric carefully watched the wizard while pretending to drink the tea.  "I built this tower a long time ago. I remember so many fond memories here. Of course I like the solitude for I can concentrate on my studies. Did you know there aren't any bees here? I wanted to have honey but alas there are no bees." The wizard drank his tea.  "Yes I am sorry to hear that. Do you know what the Drakken are?" Bardric asked just on the off chance the wizard could remember.  "Why yes I do. Someone came here a few years back and asked me to do something for them. Of course because I am so nice I agreed. They took me somewhere. I can't remember where though. Anyways they asked me to remove an old spell. I did though it was too powerful I believe. I was completely knocked off my feet. I really don't remember much after that though. I'm sorry what exactly was your question again? I seem to have lost my train of thought." The wizard asked quickly.  "You were telling me about your tower." Bardric said kindly after realizing that was all the information he was going to get from the wizard.

      "Why are you late this evening, Shari?  I really can't understand it.  It's not like you have chores or homework for that matter.  All you ever do is read your books.  YOu should make friends and get out more."  Her mother had just started her tirade.  It was now safe to roam with her mind somewhere else where she can be alone in her own little world.  Everyone was eating happily as this was a daily occurence.  Her father was ignoring everything and her brother was imagining a war with his food.  Her mother is usually the only who speaks and only to remark on other's shortcomings.  Her father of course was a physist and her mother a genetist.  A completely normal family except for that fact that we lived on a space station.  It was considered the best place for experiments and raising families says the magazines of Earth.    Shari shook her brown hair back behind her ears again.  It was awful here.  There was never enough to do to keep her busy hence her interest in books.  Of course they expected her to become a doctor of some sorts hopefully of one of their professions.  She sighed again and moved her food around her plate.  She expected her brother had it the easist.  He had friends and after chores and classes they roamed throughout the space station on missions with their toy guns.  All she got was a robot to mind her and books.  At least the later kept her somewhat busy.    After dinner she crept back to her room to pick up her book before her parents found something for her to do.    "Shari."  Her mother called from the living room.  Shari changed her mind and ducked out of the family unit into one of the walkways on the space station.  She would just take a walk around just to see if anyone painted anything green or if there is a field of trees and birds.  Maybe even a castle from the days of old could pop up in the distance.

      At long last they reached the Foggy Mountains. As far as Mandel knew, the wizard lives in the highest peak with his tower. Bardric looked around at the mountain peaks but could see no differences between them.  "How are we going to find this wizard?" Bardric yelled as he peered ahead.  "First we look for the highest peaks and then we check each one out. Sooner or later we should come upon the one we need." Trellian yelled back as he hovered for a second.  "Oh I am so glad I came with you. You make the best plans I have ever came to hear about." Bardric said in his most sarcastic voice.  "Do you have a better idea?"  "No I don't."  "Then we do it my way. That peak there looks higher than the rest." Trellian pointed with a claw before flying closer.  As they flew closer, Bardric could see something strange about the peak. It didn't seem to have the natural formation of a mountain peak at all.   "I believe we may have found it, Trellian. Fly in slowly and carefully." Bardric warned as he brought his staff to point at the peak like a knight's lance.

      "Come, Shari, it's time for dinner.  You know how your father gets when you are late."  The robot chimed as he slowly glided across the room to where Shari sat reading a book.  "But I am almost finished.  Why must I always interrupt myself just to eat dinner?  All they are going to do is ask questions, not really listen to the answers and eat."  She placed her bookmark in the book and gently placed it down on the stand beside her.  She gracefully stood up and slid her feet in her shoes.  She ran a brush through her hair.  "Do I look presentable enough for dinner, Thor."  "Yes, you look fine.  I am sure your parents will remark on your presentable looks."  Thor said as he glided out the door leading the way to the dining room.  Shari grumbled.  It truely wasn't right that a robot had a sense of humor.  But he was her protector, teacher, and when the case calls for it, her friend.  The name of course was picked as a joke.  In ancient times, Thor was a god of Thunder who lived in Asgard.  In the stories he was always portrayed as a mighty warrior.  So Thor the robot from waist up to head looked like a mighty warrior with muscular arms and chest.    She followed him into the dining room and sat down across from her brother, the brat.  Her mother and father already seated with frowns on their faces.  She sighed.

      All too soon the dragon flew towards the earth once more. Bardric could feel warmth instead of cold though not much. These are after all still mountains. Next he would remember to bring his winter clothes before going on a trek with a dragon.   "Are we here?" Bardric asked as he yanked his fingers from the scales and flexed them slowly, feeling pins and needles.  "Actually no but I thought I would give you a chance to warm up before finishing the last part of the trip. The rest of the way is just about as warm maybe a little cooler depending on shadows and things." Trellian said with a smile as he swooped closer to the ground.  "Oh you didn't need to stop on my account. I am completely fine. Not even a little bit cold." Bardric boasted to the dragon.  "Oh that would explain the two hands frozen to my scales for a little while." Trellian smiled as he landed on a ledge.  "But why stop now though. I am slowly thawing out." Bardric asked as he tried to jump off only to find himself frozen in his seat.  "That's why we are stopping. We can't have you looking like a fool as you try to thaw out." Trellian said as he turned his head to look at the wizard trying yank himself lose.  "You know you should warn me about this. I could have done something so I wouldn't become frozen to your back." Bardric said as he pulled his staff out. He said a small spell and suddenly a bucket of hot water poured down on the dragon's scales.  "Ouch!" The dragon yelled.  Bardric pulled himself away from the scales and hopped down to the ledge. He turned to see the dragon hopping a little from the hot water. "Come now. That couldn't have been that hot. Why it never bothered me a bit."  "That's because you're not human. You're not a demon. You are just plain cruel and mean to do something like that to a cold dragon." Trellian hissed at Bardric.  "At least I am not longer frozen on your back." Bardric said with a smile as he sat down on a rock.

      The dragon continued to fly through the mountain range. It was the only way to reach the Foggy Mountains. Luckily it wasn't that far away but the way is through the coldest mountains filled with snow and ice.  "Whine, whine, is that all you do? The dragon yelled as he slipped past a mountain peak and swerving to miss another.  "Yes." Bardric yelled. He held himself tight as he continued to shiver. He couldn't feel his fingers holding onto the scales.

      "Did you find out any information, Bardric?" Trellian asked as he lowered himself slightly in order to allow Bardric to climb on.  "Yes I actually found out a lot of information about the wizard and the Drakken. I know where to look for the wizard but truthfully I don't want to look for the Drakken. They sound really nasty and you know how I am around nasty things." Bardric settled in and found something to hang on.  "Well, where is this wizard to be found?" Trellian asked before taking off into the air.   "Mandel said to look in the Foggy Mountains. The wizard will be living in the highest peaks in a tower. Why do wizards live in towers anyways? They are so drafty." Bardric grunted as Trellian lifted off.  "Because wizards have a high opinion of their selves. They think it impresses people. Don't you have a tower somewhere?" Trellian asked as he turned towards the west.  "Yes I have a tower but I don't live in it. It's too cold and breezy. I rather be outside." Bardric gasped at the cold.

      Suddenly her body made a decision.  A gush of bright red blood streamed from her nose.  Quickly she raised her hand to try catching while getting a cloth.  She held the cloth to her nose while holding her head a little higher than usual.  She hated when this happened.  She hated seeing her own blood streaming out of her body.  It soon slacken off enough for her to wash her hands and face.  Luckily none got on the floor for her to clean.  She spit into the sink.  Blood.  She must have swallowed some while holding her nose up.  At least that is something to hope for.  But after an hour she was still spitting up blood though not as much at the beginning.  She didn't feel well either.  She felt a little sick to her stomach but not like food sick but something else.

      She whimpered quietly in the darkness huddled in a small corner within a closet.  She felt safe in this tiny little world of hers.  Hopefully he couldn't find her before she could disappear.  He had one of his rampages again.  The kind in which he would yell and throw things around the room.  She hated his actions.  The fear would choke her until she stood still like a rabbit waiting to be shot.  Someday she might find the courage and find her way out of the dark.  Until then she will quietly sit in her corner of her dark world.

      She whispered softly as she stared at the man who stood at the other end of the room.  He was the ultimate root of all evil.  He stood for everything she despised in a man.  She called forth on the gods and the goddesses to do her bidding.  She realized it was wrong to do harm onto another but she felt such hatred and such pain when she looked at him.  She could no longer help herself.   She wanted him to feel pain.  Pain that would last for the rest of his life.    Suddenly she just sighed and threw the energy into the cosmos.  She just couldn't do it.  She was not that sort of person and she never would be.  She combed her brown hair back behind her ears and turned away.  "Wait, Gwen."  A male voice said suddenly behind her.  She turned back to see who called.  It was him.  Oh dear.  Why goddess is he calling for me?  He finished speaking to the other man and walked towards her.  She melted.  Not again.  She couldn't handle this again.   "Where are you going in such a hurry?"  He asked as he slid his arm around her waist and led her away from the room.  "I thought I would leave the room before I became sick and embarrassed myself in front of everyone."  She said bluntly as she tried to slide away from his arm.    "Why do you hate me so much?  You're the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and yet I feel strong emotions coming from you.  I want to feel strong emotions from you but loving ones, my dear."  He said smoothly as he tightened his hold on her.  She knew she was in trouble of falling for him again.  He just had such killer looks.  Looks that any woman in her right mind would fall for.  Dark hair, strong features, strong build, and a rich velvety voice.  She knew it.  She did it again.  She would hate herself later but what could she do?  He was her absolute dream guy.  "Why do you pursue me so much?  I have shown nothing but hatred for you and yet you keep pursuing."  She turned and faced him.  Of course bad idea because now she felt the full force of his charm.    "Because you have my heart and will always have my heart.  I love you for you are the treasure of my life."  He said softely and pulled her into his arms.  "I am sorry for leaving you so long.  I had problems that had to be resolved but I am back now.  I hope that I didn't lose you but can take up where we left off before I left."  "But the rumors said that you left for another woman.  That you didn't know how to get rid of me and just left."  She said quickly not wanting to believe his tale.  "Oh is that what you believe?  Let me tell you that there has not been another woman since I laid eyes on you.  You have stolen everything from me and I am glad of that.  I feel so complete when I am with you.  Those rumors are a lie.  There was trouble on my estate.  My stable caught on fire and I had to over see the cleanup.  Luckily all the horses made it out safely."  He said grimly.  "Oh I am sorry.  I knew I shouldn't have believed those girls."  She said angrily.  "I am glad that you are okay and that your horses made it out safely.   She hugged him tightly as she realized what she almost had done to him.  She had let her emotions get control of her and she knew better than that.  After leaving him until dinner, she strolled around the garden.  Why did she believe those rumors so easily?  Something was afoot.  She noticed one of the girls across the garden.  She strolled over.  "Hello Cynthia."  She said in a nonchalant voice.  "Oh hello Gwen.  Have you heard that he is back?"  Cynthia gushed with unsupressed excitement.  "Oh no is he back."  She pretended to not have seen him yet.  "Oh yes he is.  I heard that he is looking for another woman.  Maybe you should stay out of sight."  she seemed to gush again.  "Strange.  I heard that he had to return to his estate to clean up his stable that had caught on fire."  Gwen said as she picked a pretty blue flower to smell.  "What?  That can't be.  You must have misheard."  Cynthia said quickly.   "Why don't you just stop the act and get away from me?  I no longer want to hear your lies.  I know that one of you girls are jealous of what I have with him and now it is time for you to stop playing your games."  She demanded before flying off toward her room.  Hopefully that will put an end to all the trouble.

      She peeked through the crack in the drapes.  She could see him and his advisor clearly at the far end of the room.  She couldn't tell if anyone else was there.  They spoke loud enough for her to hear their conversation clearly.    She needed to hear their plans.  There had been talk of killing the roaming bands of people in the countryside.  She didn't know if they meant the gypsies or if it was an excuse to kill her family.  The rumors flew faster than one could understand the meaning of the news.  Granted her family was considered ecentric among the townspeople.  They lived in a small village not far from the castle alone.  Yes, they do practice magic but they have never hurt anyone for that is not their way.  Her mother had passed the arts to her and she will pass them down to her children if she ever had any.    Her husband, whom she was spying on, hadn't gotten her with child yet.  She began to think he couldn't produce any.  She knew it wasn't her fault.  Her goddess herself told her that it wasn't her fault.  Now he wanted to hurt her family because he thinks that they are the reason she couldn't have a son.  He took her two years ago and married her without her family's blessing.  She had of course visited her family since then and they put no blame onto his shoulders.    She rubbed her face and combed her hair back away from her face.

      Katlyn could remember other times when this exactly nagging warned her of something important.  She knew that she couldn't ignore it this time either.  She placed too much of her time into this life and she wasn't about to lose it.  She could remember each of her deaths as if it was only yesterday and each one worse than the one before.  Dying old would be something different and something she yearned to experience one day.  It seems her soul had a mission that wouldn't be complete until everything clicked into place.  Her soul lived a thousand lives.  Each death began a new life in which her work would start over again.    Of course since the elves have found out that her soul has never died, they have been committed to help her in her mission.  At least the elves had long lives.  Since she always came back as a mortal, often she would have three or four different bodies before a new elf came to replace the old.  It was nice to have that steady influence within her chaotic life.  Often she yearned for a normal life in which she could marry, have children, grow old, and die.  Maybe someday she would experience that dream.  She looked at Lleywyn.  Unfortunately he was an complication within her life at this moment.  She could see that he fell in love with her the moment he saw her.  Well truthfully, she had feeling for him too but she squashed them back into a dark deep place because this was no time for her to feel those sorts of feelings.     They entered the small town and seeked accommodations for their stay.  The town definitely had a picturesque quality about it.  She also noticed that no one was about.  It was only three in the afternoon.  Plenty of time before the last meal of the day.    "How does this town feel to you?"  She asked the elf his opinion.     "It's too perfect.  There is secrets here.  I also feel that some are dark and others are not.  Not a very happy town."  Lleywyn replied after a few minutes of silence.   "That is exactly what I feel.  This is not good.  I feel that we are too late or perhaps almost too late.  Lets walk through the town quickly.  We need to find the one."  Katlyn said quietly and vaguely.  She definitely didn't want to give too many details just in case someone over heard their conversation.

      Bardric glanced around the library quickly. He quickly moved to the right toward an old man reading a book. The old man knew everyone who entered the library. He also took care of the library and all of the books and scrolls.   "Mandel, do you have a minute?" Bardric asked politely.  "Bardric, yes I always have a moment for you. How may I help you?" Mandel put his scroll on top of the table and waved Bardric to a chair opposite him.  "I need some information about a wizard who was here about a month ago. His name is Thandair. The book said that he was seeking knowledge of the Drakken." Bardric sat down quickly and spoke quietly.  "Oh yes, I remember. He looked through the books and the scrolls first and then he had to come to me for the information. I told him that he would find nothing written about the Drakken but that I could tell him what he needed to know since I was one of the wizards who created the barrier." Mandel spoke slowly as he remembered. His white hair grew unruly and long from inattention. It was shoulder length and his beard was just as long.  "There is a small problem now, learned one. It appears as if this Thandair has released the barrier and the Drakken are once more in the lands." Bardric clasped his hands on top of the table as he stated the bad news.  "It can not be. How could he have released the barrier? It took five of us to create it. The Drakken can not be loose upon the races. I thought he was just seeking knowledge not a way to undo our work." Mandel appeared to be in shock that a fellow wizard would abuse his knowledge to do something so evil.   "It is why I came to you. I knew that if anyone would know it would be you. We need your help. Can you tell me how you created the barrier and possibly any information you have on Thandair. I don't think I ever had the pleasure of making his acquaintance." Bardric allowed the man to digest the information.  "Well Thandair never went to the academy. Actually no one knows where he learned the art. He just suddenly appeared around ten years ago asking questions." Mandel sighed. "Asking questions about the Drakken. I should have realized."   Mandel continued to describe Thandair to Bardric. Some of the information wasn't very pretty but Bardric had to hear it all in order to understand his opponent. Mandel also told the story of the Drakken beginning with their creation, their acts of aggression, and finally their banishment. Bardric grew more concerned as he heard everything. It was time to get Trellian and look for this wizard and to figure out a way to return the Drakken to their lands.

      They reached Hewten Mountain located in the middle of the mountain range. Trellian landed in the large compound beside the entrance.   "I'll be back in a little while." Bardric said as he jumped off. He scurried inside.  Hewten Mountain housed the largest library in all the lands. It also housed the largest art collection featuring the best pieces from each race. The library was carved completely from stone with pillars holding up the ceiling through out the inside of the complex. It was considered the dwarves greatest masterpiece.   Bardric noticed that there weren't many wizards about but that didn't really matter. He immediately went to the book of requests and questions. It was proper protocol to sign in with name and reason for being in Hewten along with the date. He glanced through the pages after writing his information. He noticed a few wizards had looked up information on the Drakken. Three to be exact. He knew two of the wizards but the third, he never met before. The two he knew were very recent with one two days ago and the other yesterday. The third visited a month ago which would be along the same timeline as the Drakken leaving their country.

      "Trellian, take me to the Hewten Mountain." The wizard gathered up his stuff, grabbed his staff, and walked over to the dragon.  "And why are we going there today if I may ask since I am the pawn who is taking you there?" Trellian lowered his head and looked right into Bardric's face.  "Last night you said a wizard knocked down the magical barrier. I thought that today we would go find that wizard and make him put the barrier back. Satisfied or do I have to explain more?" The wizard placed his left hand on his waist while his right hand pointed his staff at the dragon.  "Oh, fine. Let's go since you are the only one with a plan at this moment." The dragon turned and lowered his body close to the ground to allow the wizard to hop on.  "Up, up and away." Bardric shouted brandishing his staff.  "Might I ask what all that was about?" Trellian turned his head and just looked at the wizard. He didn't move a muscle while he waited for an answer.  "I always wanted to do that. I can't help myself. I am much younger than you. Almost considered a child compared to your age." The wizard said blandly without cracking a smile.   "Now we get to hear about the age jokes. My day is so complete at this point that I feel I must take a nap." The dragon said dryly still staring at the wizard.  "Oh no. No nap today. Time to fly." The wizard smiled as the dragon turned around.  With a hop off the cliff, the dragon spread his wings, caught an updraft, and soared up into the sky. The wizard clung to the few handholds he found on the dragon's back. Probably a good thing that the mountain isn't that far off. It was a beautiful day with a blue sky and white puffy clouds. The wizard glanced at the ground marveling how tiny everything seemed from his perch.   "Are you sure you will find answers there?" Trellian asked as he turned north toward a ridge of mountains.  "If there are any answers in this world that is the place to find them. Plus all the wizards tend to stop in from time to time looking for answers so I just need to snoop around and ask questions. I should find a lead there." Bardric yelled almost choking on the sudden gust of wind as the dragon swooped down thirty feet before climbing back.  "I hope so." The dragon swooped again to gain more altitude before entering the mountain range.

      She had never felt so bored in her life.  There seemed to be nothing to do.  She was tired of watching tv which seems to be the only thing she does anymore.  She really wasn't in the mood to clean especially not at 10 pm.  The baby was put to sleep an hour ago so she didn't have to take care of her.  She really wasn't in the mood to read a book or a magazine.  She hated to be bored.  Usually she could find anything to do.  It wasn't exactly if she was a boring person.  There were lots of things she could do if she was in the mood.  It is just that lately seemed that is all she does all the time.  It's time for something new to do.  But what?  That was definitely the question.  She had some thinking to do first to decide exactly the activity that would keep her interest.  Maybe she could do some aerobics.  That would keep her busy for a little while.  She sighed.

      She stood at the top of the hill overlooking the valley.  A small sleepy town lay within the folded hills creating a picturesque scene.  She didn't like this particular mission in such a small town.  These people did not deserve this sort of terrible act that she had to deliver.  She looked to her left at the tall solemn elf standing beside her.  His silver-blonde hair lay past his shoulders waved softly in the wind unmasking the sign of his heritage, his pointed ears.    The elves have always helped her on her missions.  He was the newest in the long line of succession.  The last one had to leave to return home so he could die within his homeland.  They sent his one in his stead.  She hoped that he wouldn't have to stay his whole life with her without his family or friends.  She sighed.  So many are committed to her and her missions.      At least this particular elf considered himself to be very modern.  The first day he chattered her ears off before she could get in with a reply to answer his questions.  He didn't always obey her but asked questions first to understand the situation.  She liked him.  There have been a few elves that she couldn't get along with and she would have to send them home.    "Well, let's go before I change my mind.  I really don't like this particular part of the journey, Lleywyn."  She said to the elf as she led her horse down the hill towards the town, the elf falling into step behind her.  "Tell me, Katlyn, exactly why are we here again.  I know you mentioned about watching over a little girl but why?"  Lleywyn asked as he walked beside her.  "We need to make sure that no one kills her before she is able to do whatever she has to do.  I am not even sure what she has to do myself but she has to.  I don't even know what the little girl looks like but I am sure we'll find her.  At least we always find the person."  She replied thoughtfully not completely sure of this particular mission herself.  Something keeps nagging her about this girl.  Something just doesn't seem right.

      He rolled up into his blanket and looked at the stars. "Tell me something. How dangerous is the Drakken?" The wizard asked quietly knowing the dragon was still awake.  "Extremely. The last time they were loose on the lands they destroyed everything, farms, crops, animals, and people. They left no stone unturned in their wake." The dragon turned his eyes toward the stars.  "Why is it so hard to believe that the Drakken are here in the forests?" Bardric looked at the dragon.  "Because when we banished them from the lands into their own country, we put enough magical resistance on the borders that no one could enter or leave that country. With the Drakken here, it means that the magical barrier is down when it should have lasted as long as the world lasted. I would like to know who did it because the Drakken have no magic to even have tried to destroy that barrier. At this time we can speculate that it was a powerful wizard or sorcerer."  "I can help figure out who did it then since I know most of the wizards in the business." Bardric slowly closed his eyes as Trellian kept watch for the night.

      "You never told me that the Drakken were part human and part dragon." Bardric said accusingly as he stirred his meal in the frying pan. He sat close to the fire to keep warm from the chilly night. At the moment they were camped on top of a cliff to allow visibility in all directions.   "You never asked. Besides I thought you would have read about them or at least heard about them from somewhere." The dragon said haughtily as he picked his teeth having already eaten.  "Well I would have if there was anything written about them. Why isn't there anything written about them?" The wizard scraped the food onto a plate.  "Probably due to no one allowed in or out of that particular country and possibly because no one is alive to remember the last time. Well, no one but me though I don't think I count since I can live for at least a millennia." Trellian said with an air of arrogance while waving a talon in the air.  The wizard snorted at that remark. "There was also some caged wagons standing in the shadows with some shields and axes lying on the ground."   Trellian turned his head quickly to Bardric. "Are you sure?"  "Yes as sure as I can be without getting close enough to touch. Why?" Bardric creased his forehead.  "I'll tell you later." Trellian said swiftly. "Why don't you eat and get some sleep, Bardric? We have a big day tomorrow."  He ate with an air of thoughtfulness. He wondered what happened before to cause that particular sort of banishment and what was the dragon trying to hide from him. He looked at the dragon. He might be able to get a straight answer sooner or later from him. He sighed. He still didn't like the sound or look of this race. He can handle the trolls, ogres, even the orcs but the Drakken? He would soon see he guessed.

      He listened closely but soon he realized that the Drakken must have a native tongue. Still he watched just in case he could learn more about their characteristics and actions. He noticed that the Drakken carried a short sword on their person as well as keeps a long staff with a metal point at the end.   In the center of the meadow, the huge bonfire still burned hotly and the smoke billowed upward covering the sky and the coming of darkness. He tried to look closer at the fire to see what they were burning but he couldn't see anything. The dragon had said it in such disgust that his curiosity was peaked. He looked closer into the clearing and noticed a few caged wagons standing in the shadows. He saw some shields and axes lying on the ground not far from the fire. Further investigation would have to wait till later though. It was time for him to get out of here and find the dragon.  He slowly backed up away from the bushes. As he turned, he heard a twig snap behind him. He stopped and slowly looked behind him. Three Drakken stood behind him with their staffs pointed at him. Even close up he thought they were hideous. He shuddered again. He stood up and held his staff into the air. Reciting words in an unknown language, the smoke suddenly filled the clearing until all visibility disappeared.   He ran through the clearing with his robe over his mouth. It didn't matter which direction as long as he got away from the Drakken. The forest grew dark fast because of the thick foliage but he didn't need the light. He would rather have the darkness covering his path instead of full sunlight in which it would be easy to find him. He found a tree with a low branch and jumped up into the tree. He climbed steadily up until he reached the top and he could see the tops of the trees as the sun set in the west. He looked around to see if the dragon was flying nearby but he couldn't see any sign of him.   Whispering a few words and a wave of his hand at his staff, his staff became a bright beacon in the darkening sky. He caught his breath as he waited for the dragon to come only hoping he was quick about it and didn't take his time like normal. It was a pretty forest but too bad about being infected by the Drakken as he glanced across the trees that spread out all around him like a thick green carpet.   Behind him, a whoosh of air startled him from his thoughts. He turned quickly to look at the dragon hovering near him with a rope dangling from his feet.   "Well are you coming or not. I am not going to hover here all night you know. I need to get some sleep." Trellian yelled as he brought the rope closer to Bardric.  The wizard held tight to his staff as he grabbed the rope. "Glad you could make it. I was beginning to wonder if you did fall asleep."  "Hah! You wish. Hold on tight." The dragon slowly flew up and away from the forest for the nearest area he could land and still far enough away from the Drakken in case they were seen leaving the forest.

      He clambered down slowly out of the tree. He glanced around through the lower branches before dropping to the ground The old leaves cushioned the sound of his fall from anyone who happened by. He could smell the smoke drifting through the trees. Following his nose, he found an outer ring of trees surrounding a large meadow. Peering through the bushes he could see some forms on the other side. He sneaked until he was behind them so he could eavesdrop on their conversation.  He was close enough to see what the Drakken looked like. Now he understood the reason for the dragon's hatred. The Drakken appeared to be half man and half dragon. The skin had dark green scales and talons for fingernails. Plus a hideous ridge ran from the top of their heads down their back which was covered by plain black surcoats almost like cloaks with hoods. He shivered in horror at the thought of what else could be under their uniforms.

      "How are we going to take a look when we are way up here or have you found a solution to that problem?" The wizard leaned over the dragon and peered intently into the smoke but couldn't see a thing. He grabbed his hat as it started to slip from his head.   "Well I was thinking of dropping you off so you could sneak around and take a look." Trellian yelled back as he banked to the left.  "And where were you going to drop me off at?" The wizard grabbed on tight again as the dragon finished banking. Suddenly the dragon dropped twenty feet in free fall before catching some air with his wings to slow down the fall. Slowly, steadily the dragon fell until he was close to some branches of a large oak tree.  "I was thinking of dropping you off here for a while and I can pick you up later if you like." The dragon hovered in the air beside the tree.  "Thanks for asking me. Next time give me a little more advance notice so I can tell you that I am not a monkey!" Bardric muttered as he grabbed his pack and slung it across his shoulder while holding onto his staff. He flung his leg over and jumped into the tree.   "Well you jump like a monkey so maybe some of your ancestors were monkeys." The dragon said blandly without breaking a smile.  "Just make sure you can pick me up later. I would hate to stay down here with strangers since I hunger for your company." The wizard called back as he agilely climbed down the tree soon to be lost from sight. He proceeded slowly the closer he moved towards the forest floor just in case of trouble. He definitely didn't want that. He noticed that it was very quiet. No birds or squirrels chittering or chattering.   After he was about twenty feet from the ground, he stopped and listened. He couldn't really look around since he was still pretty high up in the tree and covered by the green leaves. Silence seemed to the forest's song today.

      She sighed with all the weight upon her shoulders. She just didn't understand why the world always weighed down upon her until she felt beaten into the ground. She felt like a rock sometimes that keeps sinking further into the ground.  "Catherine, can you please look at these quickly for me before I go into my meeting?" Tom asked as he walked by to go into his office.  She sighed again. That wasn't her job. She was a programming analyst and yet she felt like a secretary. She couldn't quit because the bills had to be paid and her family to support.  Her husband watched their daughter during the day while she worked and he also went to school to finish his degree. She only hoped it was all worth the trouble that they were going through to become financially secure.  She wanted another baby but she didn't know how to have one and go to work at the same time. She would love to stay home for the first few months to get know the new one but if she was working she can only stay home for six weeks.  She looked quickly over the papers for Tom. She noticed he got many of the technical terms wrong not only in spelling but also in context. She rewrote the paper quickly before he came out to ask about it.  Tom came out in a rush, grab the paper before she could even explain the changes to him. She sighed. She didn't care if he messed up. He should slow enough to know that she wasn't his damn secretary to begin with.

      "The elves, I fear have dimished in power since that time. It seems that we are weak and have no powers to speak of. How will we stop them before they destroy everyone and everything. How will man survive the upcoming winter without food?" The elf said quickly and quietly.  "Is there any way for all of the dragons to come together and help us fight off the Drakken?" One of the men asked believing in hope not quite wanting to believe that nothing could be done.

      As I lay upon the bed, freshly showered, flushed with a warm feeling throughout my body, I dreamed of being in the arms of my lover.  His kisses trailing down my neck onto my chest.  Ever so slightly I glide my body closer to his seeking lips.  My body moves restlessly on top of the fresh sheets feeling so cool under my body.  He slowly suckles my breast until my nipple hardens with need.   Grabbing his shoulders I pull him closer to kiss his lips, to nip his chin.   I moan with yearning, needing him now.  I moan with disappointment and with desire of the night.  He will be back in my arms once more tonight.

      Tap, tap, click, click, tap, tappity-tap tap.  She used her computer with flying speed today.  The sooner she finished the sooner she can go home, get ready, and go out on the town tonight.  Her mind kept drifting to her clothes and the activities she would delve into when the sun goes down.    She planned to wear this little black spaghetti straps number showing off her shoulders and most of her back with the length reaching the floor.  With her hair up in ringlett curls enhancing her neck and her face to perfection.    Her fingers moved rapidly across the keyboard most likely making as many mistakes as not.  She just couldn't sit still long enough to finish this work.  She started to think of ways around this mound of work without anyone noticing.    Kate stopped for a second and glared at the folders sitting in her in basket.  She pushed her brown hair behind her ears as she quickly tapped her fingernails on the desk.  Her frustration starting to show through her features.    She glanced around the office quickly though there wasn't very much to see inside this small cubicle.  An in and out box as well as a small struggling dehydrated plant yearning for sunlight sitting on the corner of her desk.  The shelves above her desk filled with office supplies as well as old completed work.  A few pictures taped to walls of her animals and a few friends.  Anything to cheer up this small depressing space of ill-managed small space called an office.    She jumped as the phone rang.  She hated that phone.  It was always so quiet inside her cubicle even though noise filtered through the walls from the other cubicles enough to sound like a riot.  "Hello.  This is Kate.  How can I help you?"  She quickly answered.  "Kate, this is Mr. James. Can you please come into my office for a moment."  A male voice sounded into her ear.  That of course was her employer.  He never spoke to her unless it was extremely important.  This is not good.  She sighed.  She stood up from her chair and quickly placed her jacket on before straightening her hair and clothing.  Quickly she moved down the hallway smiling to those few co-workers that she have talked with before.  His door of course was located at the other end of the cubicle maze so she had to weave through the little hallways.  All too soon the brown oak door stood in front of her.  She smiled at the secretary and told her name and that he was expecting her.  The secretary beeped him to let him know she was here and she was given the go-ahead to continue through the door.  Mr. James sat at his desk with a folder open full of paper.  It looked he was studying the information with a fierce determination.  "Yes, Kate, please sit down."  He waved her to the chair in front of his desk.  "You wished to see me, sir."  Kate asked tentively as she sat down.  "Yes, I have been going over these papers for a while now.  I don't understand exactly the information shown here.  Now this is the folder that you worked on and I believe that you made a mistake.  Why don't you look at the papers and tell me what you think?"  He slowly scooted the folder to the other side of the desk.    Kate took the folder and slowly flipped through all the papers.  He was right.  It didn't make sense but yet she could remember filling the papers out.  She also remembered filling the paperwork out correctly and not like this.  She shook her head.  "Sir, you are correct.  The paperwork here is wrong.  I don't remember doing the paperwork in this manner but since it is right here in front of me, there is no excuse for this work that I can offer you."  Kate said quietly, thinking quickly.  She didn't understand the condition of the paperwork.  "You've been with us for a while now and so I will let this go.  Next time though I will have to take a more direct action.  Please redo this and give it to my secretary as soon as you finish.  That will be all."  "Thank you, sir."  Kate left quickly with the folder.  She thanked whichever providence was looking over her at that moment.  She smiled at the secretary on her way out and scurried quickly to her cubicle.  Quickly she opened the folder up and glanced at the date.  Unlike most employees, she actually kept a backup of all completed work on a cd organized by date.  She grabbed her keys and opened up her locked filing cabinet crammed in behind her.  She grabbed the cd marked with the same date as the paperwork inside the folder.  She pulled up the work and noticed something strange.  It was the same and yet it wasn't the same as the papers.  The original was different.  She glanced through the work quickly and reprinted it out.  She placed the work into the folder and quickly dropped the folder off at the secretary's desk before going back to her desk.  Who could have done that to her?  Someone was out to get her for some reason or another.  She shook off those thoughts and quickly turned to her other work.

      "Man was never involved in the decision of the Drakken last time. Granted the Drakken destroyed many towns but no one survived to tell the tale. When the border was in place, we thought there was no need. The Drakken were better left alone and forgotten. Apparently we were wrong." Trellian explained quickly shrugging his shoulders and moved his hands in a beseeching manner.  "How are we going to replace the border?" An elf asked from behind the elf leader.  "That is the problem. The last time we gathered the most powerful wizards, dragons, and elves together and performed a magical spell that created the border. In case you haven't noticed, there are only a few dragons in the lands anymore. Wizards are far and few in between and the elves, well no one knows about the elves." Trellian said with a laugh and a smile towards the elves.

      "Why not just destroy them? Maybe I am missing all of the information here." One of the men asked quietly in the small silence.  "Because the Drakken cannot be destroyed. It was tried before and it almost ruined the lands and the races." The elf said snidely in the direction of the man.  "How come we don't remember the stories? How come we've never heard of them before now?" Another man asked quickly to stop that particular act of aggression.

      "Yes we know. Why would a dragon and a wizard concern their selves with our affairs, elves would wonder?" The elf stated as he looked at Trellian and at Bardric and his staff.  Bardric bowed slightly to show his respect. "We bother because the Drakken are a dangerous threat. This isn't the first time they appeared in these lands."   "Drakken? Is that what we fight?" The elf said suddenly. He turned and looked at the man. "We will not win against the Drakken. You said they were orcs and ogres. You have deceived us?"   "No we didn't know. The reports we got were fuzzy at best and we thought that since the reports said monsters that they were referring to the orcs and ogres. We have never heard of the Drakken." The man started to get very excited and waved his arms about or at least as much as the armor would allow him.  "Might I make a slight suggestion? How about we disband your knights and soldiers while we have a conference and share information?" Bardric said quickly to stop a panic of everyone in the area.  "That is a fine suggestion." The elf said. Quickly he said something in elvish and all the elves turned to the far end of camp. Apparently it was their camp with all the colorful tents that almost resembled a fair. Suddenly a pale green sailed over Trellian's head to be joined at the tree. Soon there was a tent above their heads as well to keep the sun out.   Soon there was a ring of the top leaders, Bardric guessed. He couldn't be sure. The elves, of course, provided refreshments. They are such a courtesy race. He slid off the dragon's back and perched on a rock beside him. Trellian curled up on the ground with his face lying on the ground to be close to the men and elves.  "Is everyone here?" Bardric asked before beginning.  "Yes, everyone is here that is suppose to be here." The elf answered as he quickly assessed the ring.  "I should start at the beginning so the men can catch up. The Drakken are half dragon and half man. How or why they were made I don't know but in a time long ago, they raided these lands. They destroyed everything in their paths including men, women, and children. Soon everyone knew that something had to be done or else no one would be left. So the elves, dragons, and wizards gathered at a land while men lured all of the Drakken inside of this land. As soon as the Drakken were inside, the elves, dragons, and wizards worked their magic to create a magical border to keep the Drakken inside of this land. Recently someone destroyed the border and left them out. Why, well we can only guess. Anyways that is where we stand now." Bardric held out his hands to show his helplessness.  "Do we know who left them out of their confinement?" The elf asked at last.  "Yes, but he won't be able to help you. He's mad. The magic back lashed and ruined him." Trellian replied quietly.  "We should be thinking of ways to get them back to their lands and how to recreate the border. Trellian and I haven't come up with anything that could possibly help." Bardric said quietly as he looked at Trellian.  The men during this time have been very quiet. Not quite believing what was said and yet they had no choice since no one else was denying anything. Bardric hoped that this wouldn't spark a small confrontation.

      After flying East for a few hours, the dragon noticed something strange among the trees.  "Bardric, what do you see down there?" Trellian yelled as he pointed with a talon.  Bardric leaned over the side. His eyes roved the area until he found a large enough clearing within the trees to view anything vital. Silver flashed within the trees as if soldiers were readying for war. That couldn't be, could it?   Trellian, I think there are warriors down there. Soldiers?" Bardric yelled.  The dragon swooped closer towards the trees looking for a large enough clearing to land. All of a sudden the dragon dropped to the ground. Bardric grabbed tightly to the scales. Trellian landed with a slight thump, jarring Bardric only slightly from his seat.  They glanced around the clearing and through the trees. Not long though they were surrounded by a ring of armor armed with swords. Bardric glanced at Trellian before glancing around the ring again.  "Who is your leader?" Trellian asked as he looked closely at the steel ring.   "I am." A deep voice announced from the right. A suit of armor stepped into the ring, lowering his sword before removing his helmet.  "Who do you fight, Sir?" Bardric asked quietly.  "We fight the Drakken of course. They are like disease in this land. Which side are you on?" The soldier replied.  "Oh we're against the Drakken ourselves. We've been gathering information though not very good information." Trellian replied quickly. "We're actually on our way to speak to the elves about the Drakken."  Another suit stepped into the circle. Only this suit was much different than the one for the man. This suit looked so light and so shining that it couldn't possibly be human or even dwarven made. The suit didn't require a helmet so it was easily to see that this was no man but elf with pointed ears and silvery hair.  "Ahh I see. The elves already know." Trellian looked closely at the new figure.

      "I guess we go see the elves." Trellian said as he watched Bardric climb on his back.  "I don't think we're going to have much luck there either." Bardric wiggled to get into a more comfortable position while securing his pack and staff.  "Well maybe we should just leave these lands and let the Drakken have them." Trellian said crossly as he flapped his wings.  "I don't think that will solve the problem at hand. We are after all trying to help here not just cut and run. Though it is a nice thought. I would love to visit my tower at this moment even though I hate the thing." Bardric laughed at the thought.  "You're never serious for very long my friend. That could be a dangerous trait." Trellian flexed his wings before taking off into the air.  Bardric swallowed his words until the dragon had smoothed his flight. "Yes it could be dangerous but I also good at escaping." Bardric yelled as he grinned.

      First they landed to talk to the dwarves since they lived at the edge of the mountains in an underground world mining for ores. They didn't expect anything from the dwarves since their only concern is mining. But still they had to try.   "Do I have to be the one who has to tell them?" Bardric said as he slipped down from the dragon's back.  "Yes." Trellian smiled as he watched Bardric suffer.  "Why can't you do it? I talked to everyone else." Bardric said defensively.  "Because I can't fit inside the small cave entrance as well as their hallways." Trellian replied as he pushed the wizard toward the entrance with a talon.  Bardric sighed. "It's a good thing I like you a little bit." Bardric straightened up and marched toward the entrance. It's always good to make a good impression with the dwarves.  As he approached, two of the rocks shifted and moved. Bardric looked closer. Dwarves camouflaged as rocks. He couldn't even see them until they moved. How ingenious.   "Well, what do ya want?" The black-bearded dwarf on the right asked.  Bardric had to strain his ears and filter the accent just to make the words out clearly. "I must tell the King that the Drakken are back in the lands causing mischief." Bardric puffed out his chest with all the importance he could muster.  "The King already knows this so ya may not enter." The red-bearded dwarf on the left answered waving his battle ax.  "If the King already knows then I will not bother you further. Please send the regards of Bardric, the wizard to his Kingship, Thain." Bardric turned and walked away.

      She groped her way slowly using the wall for guidance.  It turned pitch black after sixth feet into the cave, Ayslynn hungrily looked behind her at the fading light of the outside but turned with determination to move further into the darkness.  She kicked a stone that rattled against the wall.  The echos told a small story of the cave turning into a large cavern.    "Excuse me, who is there?"  A deep voice rumbled from the darkness of the cave.  Ayslynn stumbled against the wall trying to pierce through the darkness looking for the source of the voice.  "I..I'm sorry.  I didn't think anyone was in here.  Can I stay here a while..."  She trailed off.  Her voice trembling as she clung to the wall.

      Ayslynn breathed heavy as a stitch grew in her side as she kept pushing herself forward over the rocks.  She turned her head for a quick glance behind when her foot suddenly turned and slipped causing her to tumble four feet.   She slowly checked her feet and legs to make sure they weren't broke before standing.  The moment she put her weight upon her foot, she felt a sharp pain arching through her body.  She whimpered quietly as she hobbled across the rock she fell on.  It was a good thing it caught her as she looked down.  Another twenty feet until she would have hit the ground and more than her foot would have hurt mostly she would be unconscious or dead.    She glanced back the way she came again.  She could hear men calling and running above her.  She looked around quickly for a niche or a cave for her to hide.  Ayslynn rubbed her face pushing her long red hair behind her ears as her eyes lighted upon a cave hidden by outcropping rocks.  She slowly hobbled over the rocks to view the cave more closely.  It was very large by the look of the entrance.  She only hoped nothing moved in with claws and big teeth.  Carefully she wiggled her body around the outcropping rock to hop down a few feet to the ground below.  She took one more glance around before stepping into the darkness.

      Tran hummed softly as she walked to the stream behind the house to gather a bucket of water.  Early evening with the sun just starting to say good night and the animals are going to sleep or waking up was her favorite time of day.  She sat down on a rock beside the stream.  She took a deep breath and looked around.  This time is often called the gate between worlds as though there were different worlds that one can move between from one to the other.  She smiled at that thought though she couldn't deny the fact that sometimes weird things seem to happen at dusk.  It seemed the world was holding its breath during the eerie silence.  She sighed before getting up and filling up the bucket with fresh water.  Her light auburn hair slid slowly into her eyes blinding her vision.  She shoved it back just as she saw a deer heading down for water on the other side of the stream.   She froze even though she sat in an awkward position holding a bucket in the water with her back arched.    It was so beautiful with gold brown hair and big brown eyes.  It was a doe.  Tran looked into the forest to see if there was a fawn but she couldn't see any.  The moment between the worlds passed and the night grew darker.  She was sorry she had to move and startle the doe but they would be calling for her soon if she didn't head back now.  She slowly picked up the full bucket and swiveled on her feet.  Watching behind her, she moved slowly away and the doe seemed to either not notice or not care.  After putting ten feet in between, Tran moved at a more normal pace and kept close watch on the darkened path ahead of her.  She didn't want to lose her water and have to get more which would make her very late indeed.     To Eris

      "We should have asked how many days would it take to reach this cabin."  Aidan said with a smile as he sat down on a log beside her.    "He wouldn't have given us a straight answer.  Elves are known to speak in riddles just to drive us completely crazy so they can smirk behind our backs.  It truly is all harmless but I agree.  Even though we are given safe passage, this forest still gives me the creeps."  Morrigan inched closer to Aidan for comfort.  She looked around the forest though she couldn't see much.  Darkness had fallen and only shadows of bushes and trees could be seen.  Not even the moon or stars could reach through the thick blanket of leaves.  An owl hooted in the distance mostly likely chasing after a mouse.    "It's too quiet isn't it?"  She whispered to Aidan.  "Yes, it is, but I like it.  It was always so noisy in the village at least the part I lived in.  You probably didn't notice the noise living on the edge like you did."  Morrigan felt his arm reach around her and pulled her tightly against him.  "You know, you can both go to sleep now."  A small voice spoke on Morrigan's left close to a bush.  Morrigan sat up and looked closely at the bush until she saw the small outline of a gnome.  She smiled.  "Hello there.  Did you keep watch over us last night?"  "Yes I did and so did the wood nymph."  The gnome said gruffly.  "Thank you so much.  May I ask your name?"  Morrigan asked quietly.  She felt Aidan shift his weight so he could see who was speaking.  "No, you may not.  I wish to be unknown at least until after everything is cleared up."  "We will turn in now so you can keep watch."  She squeezed Aidan's arm and pushed herself off the log to lay down on the ground.  She felt Aidan lay down beside her and pull her close.  She leaned close to his ear and whispered. "That's a gnome."  She felt Aidan squeeze her waist in answer.    All too soon the sounds of the forest acted as a lullaby and Morrigan fell into a deep sleep though filled with restless scenes.  Over and over she kept seeing a red-hair woman who wasn't her mother.  Morrigan could tell she was evil but she couldn't do anything to be released from the grasp of the dream.  Finally after it seemed like years, Morrigan woke enough to return to sleep without dreams.  In the darkness, the gnome smiled as he watch Morrigan fall asleep once more.

      Birds singing woke Morrigan the next morning to find Aidan already awake creating a breakfast meal out of miscellaneous items.  The forest seemed a little different this morning.  A little less threatening and more welcoming with a little sun filtering through the trees and the sounds of the animals foraging for food.  "Morning."  Morrigan said as she stretched slowly.  Stiff from sleeping on the hard ground all night and from running for the last few days.    "Morning, sleepyhead."  Aidan came over and kissed her on the nose before handing her some nuts and berries.  "Strange thing.  I found the nuts and berries on some leaves this morning."  "The elf must have spoke true last night about helping us though I doubt the elves left the food.  Most likely it was one of the other fair folk.  We must leave some token of our appreciation."  Morrigan smiled as she chewed on the nuts.    "So we are granted sanctuary while we stay in this forest as long as we obey the laws. So tell me Morrigan.  I have been meaning to ask.  Can anyone learn the craft or are only certain people allowed?"  Morrigan watched Aidan stretch his arms to the sky hungrily gazing at his body.  "Anyone can study the craft.  Like if you wanted, I could teach you the lore and you would be able to create a globe of light like I did last night."  Morrigan answered quickly before eating a few berries.  "Okay but why are you so special since anyone can learn it?"  Aidan looked intently into her eyes.  "Because my family are considered natural witches.  While it is nice to know the lore it isn't needful for us to perform magical tasks."  Morrigan finished by gathering their belongings together.  "I was wondering if you could teach me the craft.  I mean I doubt I will ever have the power you have but I would like to understand it better.  I mean I heard all the stories so I am sure I have a few biases but learning will clear any ignorances up quickly."  Aidan said as he took his pack from her and squeezing her hand.  "I would love to teach you the lore.  The first part is very easy of course.  It's all stories about the fair folk and the beginnings of the craft.  But for now, let's reach our destination before the fair folk shoo us through the forest for taking too long."  Morrigan giggled as she suddenly tagged Aidan and took off running.  "Catch me if you can."  Morrigan heard Aidan laughed before pounding after her.  She giggled and spoke the words of camouflage.  She slowly faded into the background until to the untrained eye, she was gone from sight.    She watched Aidan stop suddenly and look around closely.  "You're cheating."  Aidan yelled as he turned in a circle looking for her.  She tapped his shoulder, giggling as she hopped out of the way.    Suddenly she felt his arms around her squeezing her tight against his body.  "I got you now, minx."   "How did you find me?"  Morrigan asked breathlessly.  "Remember I used to hunt for the village plus I have very good eyesight and hearing."  Morrigan turned in his arms, spoke the words to undo the spell, watching his grin spread wider as she appeared before him.  "I should have remembered that but at least now I know the ability of spells working around you."  She squeezed him tightly.  "We better be moving though.  All too soon it will be dark again and we must reach that cabin the elf spoke about."  They walked for a long period of time before taking a rest to eat and drink from a small stream that passed through the forest.  The cool refreshing water seemed to revive their energy, helping them to continue their journery for a few more hours.   Nope

      They continued to walk through the forest for another hour or so before making camp.  They didn't dare make a fire for that would be a threat to the forest.  Morrigan snuggled close to Aidan and ate a piece of bread.  It was the last of the bread so they would have to scrouge tomorrow for something to eat.    Deep in her thoughts, she kept going over the lore in her mind to keep her craft strong within her.  Tomorrow she could feel that things were going to get rough for them either because they would have to find their food or the fact that they are finally entering the forest proper.  Suddenly she felt Aidan sit up quickly.  She blinked coming back to herself in a flash to find that someone had joined them in their makeshift camp.  She couldn't see in this darkness so she clicked her fingers and produced a small globe of light that floated in the middle.  "That's a neat and helpful trick, child."  The voice said quietly about the globe of light.  Morrigan took a close look at their guest.  She noticed the way the stranger sat on the ground with his legs crossed in a relaxed manner.  She glanced at the long silvery blond hair and the pointed ears poking through the strands and the feline eyes that stared at her.  "My lord."  She nodded her head to show her respect.  "My name is Morrigan and this is Aidan.  Please forgive us for traveling through your forest without your permission."  The elf nodded in reply.  "Under the present circumstances, one can understand why you had to flee to this forest.  I also know that you are a child of the forest so I know you understand many of our ways even if you do not have the power or connection like we have.  Please continue through the forest though remember to be careful.  I will warn the pranksters to leave you alone of course that doesn't mean they won't come out and talk to you continuously until you wish for death just to have silence once more.  We will speak later when you have reached your destination.  If you continue through the forest, you will find a small cabin that you may use for now.  Fare thee well until then."  Morrigan blinked and elf disappeared from view.  She clicked her fingers again and distinquished the small globe.  "That was an elf, right?"  Aidan asked quietly in her ear.  "Oh yes, that was an elf.  It appears we have been given shelter for now though I have no idea why."  Morrigan snuggled closer to Aidan.  He squeezed her tight as he whispered, "At least we can feel somewhat safe now and sleep sound if we like."  Morrigan didn't make a sound for she had already fell into a deep sleep.  Aidan soon followed her into dreamland.    Eyes appeared in the brush and quiet rustlings ruffled the bush.  "Shhh, don't wake them."  A quiet voice said as a form took shape from the tree beside the sleeping couple.  "Sorry."  Whispered a small gnome who was moving into a better position to keep watch for the night.   Maybe I should point it out to him

      Eerie was the first word that entered Morrigan's mind as she entered the cool dark forest.  There was so many trees that it blocked the sunlight from touching the forest floor though she could see a few sun spots ahead.  She could feel the forest vibrating under her feet and the whispers on the cool breeze brushing her pale cheek.    "This forest is old and alive."  Morrigan whispered to Aidan as they moved slowly forward.  "Be careful.  Do not disturb anything, touch any of the trees, and do not start any fires or go towards the trees with an ax."  "Why?" Aidan asked close to hear, surprising her.  "Because the forest is alive.  It might take offense to you burning a piece of wood and I don't want to think about the penalty for that.  Remember the forest is full of fair folk."  Morrigan answered quietly sweeping her arms back in a grand gesture taking in the whole forest.   "What are the fair folk exactly?  I mean I heard the stories in the village but sometimes I wondered if they actually knew what they were speaking about."  Aidan stepped carefully over some roots that creeped under the ground like snakes intertwined.  "The village stories weren't always accurate but they were close.  You have heard of elves?"  Morrigan continued after seeing Aidan nod affirmation.  "Elves no longer live in our world though they do visit at times especially when the the planes are close together.  They are the most powerful of the fair folk but also the most dangerous.  The elves blame us for destroying land so they left to preserve their power and their kind.  Then of course there are the faeries, the brownies, the gnomes, the pixies, and the dryads.  There are many more but those are the ones most people have heard about in stories."  Morrigan stopped for a moment to catch her breath and to glance at Aidan.  "Should we worry about any of the fair folk or will they leave us alone?"  Morrigan glanced at Aidan as he stopped beside her and gently rubbed her shoulder as he asked his question.   "It depends.  Sometimes they take an active interest and other times they do not.  There is no use worrying about it until something happens.  If something does happen, I'll take care of it."  Morrigan smiled distractively as he continued to rub her shoulder.  It felt so good on her tired muscles.    "Well let's hope they stay away until we can reach our destination.  Come, let's continue.  This forest makes me somewhat nervous."  Aidan smiled as he pulled her along by her hand.  She squeezed his hand tightly.  "Morrigan, do you know how far we must go in order to be safe or do we just keep going until we stop?"  "I have no idea.  I think we should keep going.  Either the specter will come back to let us know when we finally arrived or someone else will let us know."  Morrigan replied as she hopped off a large rock.  Aidan sighed.  "I wish the fair folk and ghosts were just a little more clearer in their messages."  "Be happy.  We're finally having an adventure instead of doing drudge work in the village."  She smiled mischieviously.  She tapped him on the shoulder, "Catch me if you can," and pranced between the trees and bounded over the rocks.  She could hear Aidan following behind her.  She giggled and heard Aidan laugh in reply.  All too soon, Aidan caught her around the waist and hugged her close to him.  He smelled good, she noticed, squeezing him around the waist tighter.  She could feel his warm breath on her hair.  Finally after it seemed they held each other for hours, they parted and continued on their way north through the forest.

      Several hours later, they were still threading their way through the trees.  The forest filled with tall trees, bushes low to the ground, and rocks created a shadowy atmosphere that hid many secrets.  They stopped to take a break to eat some bread that Aidan brought with him.  "Morrigan, what is it like to use the craft?"  Aidan asked before chewing on another bite of bread.  "The craft is dangerous.  I have this power to do pretty much anything I want for good or evil.  It is my choice after all but I also know that whatever I send out I will recieve times three in return.  Of course those of us who use their power to do bad sometimes don't recieve their due for a long time but always eventually they do.  Even if it is in the afterlife they get their just reward."  Morrigan took a bite of her bread and smiled at Aidan.  "So during this period of your life, you must choose your way?"  Aidan took another bite and looked around the forest.  Something didn't seem right.    "Yes I get to choose.  It's always been this way in my family.  Though I am a little late but I do choose to perform good things if I choose to use my craft."  A branch snapped causing them to scramble up and look around.   "There."  Morrigan pointed a little to the left from the direction they just came.  Aidan pushed her down and squatted beside her as a handful of people could be seen through the trees.  The people beat the bushes as they passed and looked around as though searching for something or someone.  Morrigan looked at Aidan with concern and squeezed his arm tightly.  Aidan grabbed their stuff and pulled Morrigan with him as he ran between the trees and bushes squatted low to the ground.    Soon they stopped to look behind once more to see if the people saw them.  "Are they looking for us?"  Morrigan whispered quietly in Aidan's ear.  "I believe they are.  At least they are doing the things that are normally done to look for someone though beating the small bushes defeats my thinking."  Aidan whispered quietly with a shrug.    "I know why they are beating the bushes.  Some witches are known to be shapeshifters though it taxes the strength leaving the witch defenseless when she returns to her natural form."  Morrigan answered quietly.  "Can you do that?"  He asked amazed.  "I know how though I've never tried.  It's very dangerous.  We better hurry on.  We need to get to the dark forest before the villagers find us."  Morrigan grabbed her things and darted through the brush.    Morrigan heard Aidan keep up with her as she darted between bushes to the edge of the forest.  She broke out into the late afternoon sun and ran flat out for the dark forest across the clearing.  She heard Aidan pounding behind her and shouts coming from the edge of the forest behind her on the right.  She ran harder even though she felt a sharp pain grab her side almost causing her to bend over.  She stopped at the edge to look behind to make sure the villagers weren't going to follow.  Aidan stopped behind her and looked back too.  The villagers stood there at the edge watching to make sure they entered, she guessed.  She gave a cheery wave and stepped forward into the unknown.   Not yet

      "Where are we going to go?"  Morrigan asked after resting for a while inside a cave with Aidan.  They walked the rest of the night until they found this cave.  It was small, dark, and somewhat damp but it was a refuge in which to rest safely for a little while.  "I thought maybe we could go to another village and start a new life but I really haven't thought that far."  Aidan admiited as he ran his fingers through his black hair, his dark eyes glowed in the gloom of the cave.  The sun outside warmed up the air a little and lit the inside of the cave but it was still chilly and full of shadows.    "Maybe we can move around a little before settling down in another village.  Besides I still think you should go home.  You're not a witch and your family is there."  Morrigan picked up Aidan's hand and squeezed it tightly.    "Morrigan."  Aidan sighed.  "Haven't you figured it out yet?"  "Figured what out?"  Morrigan asked completely at a loss, not understanding the message Aidan was trying to impart to her.  "That I want to be with you.  I want to protect you and take care of you.  I want to love you and have children with you."  Aidan squeezed her hand back and looked into her green eyes.  Morrigan sat for a moment is shocked silence before really taking a look at Aidan and remembering all the times he stood up for her while growing up in the village.  He always seemed to be there in the background when she did get into trouble.  She remembered this one boy throwing rocks at her and screaming witch when she won a children's game.  Aidan was there to stop the boy from throwing rocks and to take her home safely.  Another time she had gotten so angry that she caused trees and bushes within five feet of her to shake like a terrible wind storm.  Aidan was quick to grab her and carry her off into the forest until she calmed down.  There certainly wasn't anything wrong with his looks either, she thought with a smile and a glance.  His dark hair, pale face, dark eyes and a full mouth created a dream face that every girl dreamed of marrying.  He stood at least six feet with stocky arms and a solid build with strong muscles from working in the fields all day.    She smiled at him, loosened her hand from his and stepped outside in the bright sun.  She turned around to find that he had followed her outside.  "Aidan, are you sure that I am the one you want?  I am a witch and one of our daughters will be a witch and so forth as it has always been.  We will be persecuted just like my mother."  Morrigan paused and listened to the specters that clung to this world.  She whispered questions about her Mother and her worries to them in hopes that they could help.  Suddenly one appeared in front of Morrigan and Aidan.  Morrigan pushed Aidan behind her as she faced the dark specter.  "Child of the land, your Mother is dead by the hands of the ignorant.  You must go from here for they are looking for you and spreading word through the closest villages who pass it on to other villages.  You must go north into the old land of the fair folk for only then will you be safe from harm."  The specter ended by pointing a ghastly bony finger to the north and slowly disappeared back into his world.  Morrigan sighed.  She would grieve later for her mother and give her last rites.  She looked at Aidan's pale face before glancing North.    "What was that, Morrigan?"  Aidan finally asked after a few minutes of waiting to see if it was really gone.  "That was a ghost from the other world.  I heard voices so I asked a few questions though usually they don't appear like that unless it's important.  It appears we have champions to our cause.  We must head north for I have no doubt that the villagers are right behind us."  Morrigan grabbed her sack from the cave and grabbed Aidan's pack that he had packed before he had come to warn her last night.  Aidan took his pack, squeezing Morrigan's hand before placing his pack on his back.  "So we go to the North, the land of the fair folk.  I had always thought those were just stories.  I do have to say that life with you won't ever be boring, my morri."  He smiled at her before taking the lead through the forest slowly threading their way between rocks and trees.  "But you must be careful of the fair folk for like the stories say they are tricksters and pranksters.  They love to make the human kind mad with their fun and games.  It definitely shall be different from living a dull life in the village."  Morrigan laughed at that thought, hurried to catch up with Aidan, and took his hand in hers.

      The day remained calm and quiet.  Morrigan was grateful for that small gift from the goddess.  She felt exhausted from a night of dancing and her throat felt raw from the chanting.  Still she felt this small glimmer of excitement inside which made her tingle all over.  She watched the sun move slowly below horizon as she ate her supper meal.  It was a quiet meal with her mother filled with comfort and peace.  Early to bed they both went in high hopes of having a good day tomorrow.    The door crashed open scaring Morrigan awake from a sound sleep.  She jumped out of bed and rushed into the kitchen.  There stood Aidan framed in the dark doorway for it was past midnight at the very least.  He looked frightened and pale in the darkness.  "What is it, Aidan?" Morrigan asked quickly as her mother came into the kitchen behind her.  "The villagers are crazed.  Someone blamed you and your mother placing a hex on their family.  They said they have proof for no matter the action they took they couldn't rid of the boils on their feet."  Aidan said quickly without pause for breath.  "The McKay family?"  Mother asked quietly.  "Yes.  How did you know?"  Aidan asked as he looked behind him before shutting the door.  "They came to me for a cure and I of course told them to soak their feet in warm water and the boils will disappear in ten to fourteen days."  She answered as she quietly moved through the kitchen.  "I guess they didn't follow your directions for they still have the boils.  You need to run from here for they plan to come and hurt the both of you.  They are screaming witch without just cause."  Aidan moved to their bedroom and started to put my clothes into a sack he found in a corner.  "You take Morrigan and run from the village.  I will stay here and hold them off."  My mother said quietly as she laid out a few things on the table along with a bowl.    "But, mother, why not come with us?"  Morrigan rushed around getting dressed and putting a few things she couldn't leave behind into the sack.    "I'm too old to keep running.  Besides I did my duty by raising you and teaching the craft.  It's time you struck out on your own anyways.  I don't know why you kept putting it off.  You are sixteen and old enough to be on your own."  Her mother wrapped a bunch of herbs together and placed them inside of Morrigan's sack.    Morrigan hurried to her mother and looked her in the eye only to find that she was taller.  When did that happen?  "What will you do, Mother?"  "I will face them with courage.  Now I want you to go.  I love you, daughter.  Blessed be and may all the gods keep watch over you."  Morrigan hugged her mother tight before grabbing her sack.  Aidan stood by the door keeping an eye on the village while Morrigan packed her things and said goodbye.  "I love you, Mother.  Blessed be."  Morrigan grabbed Aidan's hand and rushed out the door heading into the deep forest.  She stopped suddenly as soon as she was out of sight of the village.  She looked back to make sure they weren't followed before looking at Aidan.  "Aidan, you should return to the village now before they find out that you warned us."  "I can't.  You need to be protected and I am the one who can do that."  Aidan showed his determination on his face.   Morrigan sighed as she saw his forehead creased and his lips tight.  He could be so stubborn sometimes.  "I can protect myself.  I have the craft to help me."  "The craft is what gets you into trouble all the time.  What do you think just got you into trouble back in the village?  It certainly wasn't making candles or washing clothes.   Now we better hurry to find a place to sleep the rest of the night before they realize that you aren't in the house with your Mother."    Morrigan left Aidan drag her deeper in the forest.  She would go along with him for the time being until she could talk sense into his stubborn mind.   To my husband who hasn't noticed yet

      Morrigan chanted with her arms raised towards the dark sky.  The fire lit up her face and her hair like flames as her eyes mirrored the fire.  Deep in the woods hidden in a small glen, Morrigan and her mother danced and sang around the fire celebrating the new year.    A hand reached through the brush and slowly pushed it aside.  A face appeared in the opening, watching the celebration with avid interest.  Slowly the young face smiled and disappeared back into the woods.    A few hours from dawn, Morrigan and her Mother put out the bonfire and hurried back to the hut to clean up.  They could not be seen like this or the villagers would suspect something was wrong.  Morrigan tingled inside from the celebration.  She knew she wouldn't sleep the last few hours of the night but sit and daydream for a while.  She hurried and changed her clothes, washing her skin before putting on her plain clothes.  She put her colorful celebration clothes away until the next festival.  She mixed the concoction that would return her hair back to the dull brown color that hid her fire brilliance hair.  Her mother did the same with her hair and her clothes.    Soon the sun would be up and things had to be the same as yesterday.  Morrigan hated this hiding but there was nothing she could do.  Suddenly there was a scratching at the door of the hut.  Morrigan hurried with her hair to allow her Mother to finish hiding everything.  She walked over to the door with a fear in her heart for it was still quite late for someone to be calling a social call.    She opened the door slowly.  She looked at Aidan leaning against the door.  "What are you doing here at this hour?"  She asked quickly as she glanced back at her Mother before glancing back at him.  "I couldn't sleep.   I was just wondering if you were up yet so we could go for a walk in the dark."  Aidan asked quietly as he nodded a hello to Morrigan's Mother.  "Oh okay.  Let's go for a walk."  Morrigan grabbed her shoes quickly, smiled at her mom before gliding out the door.    "Let's walk over here for a bit away from the village."  Aidan quietly used his hand on her elbow to guide her way over the rough ground.  "Tell me what's going on, Aidan."  Morrigan asked after a few minutes of hushed silence between them.  He was her best friend who always seem to be there when she got into trouble.  There had been times when she used her craft accidently and he always seemed to be there to guide her way out of the trouble and back to her hut.  He was several years older than her sixteenth year.    "I saw you and your Mother tonight.  You seemed so different with your red hair flowing down your back instead of this dull brown.  I never seen you so carefree before."  He smiled as he pushed her down on a large rock and sat down beside her.    Morrigan gasped quietly.  "Aidan, what exactly did you see tonight?"  Morrigan had to know his thoughts about tonight.  "I saw you and your Mother celebrating your Samhian.  I know you are both witches so don't worry.  I knew since the first time I saw you get angry with one of the other children and fire lit up your green eyes.  I won't tell.  I'll protect you if anyone found out.  You know that don't you?"  Aidan said quietly looking into her eyes.  "Yes I know that you would protect me.  You always seem to be there whenever I would get into any sort of trouble.  How do you feel about me being a witch?"  Morigan had to know.  "I don't mind you being a witch.  It is your heritage after all, right?"  Aidan asked as he watched the sun slowly rise over the horizon.  "Yes it is our heritage.  Every woman born in my family with red hair has the ability for the craft.  Usually it's mother to daughter but every now and then a woman will have more than one daughter with one powerful daughter and the other with no abilities."  Morrigan had no idea why she was telling him the secrets of her family but she was so she hoped she could trust him.   To my husband

      Morrigan pushed her dull brown hair behind her ears, wishing she didn't have to dye it all the time to hide her bright red hair.  It was a curse not to hide it.  Her red hair was like a banner telling everyone that she was a witch the same as her mother.  Her mother also dyed her hair for she had to hide too.  They had their own hut at the edge of the village and everyone avoided them even though there was never any proof of the craft.    Morrigan glanced at her mother working at the table making the supper meal before turning back to glance out the door.  She watched the villagers move about their daily lives completing errands before their last meal of the day.  She wished she could accepted as a member of this village but she knew it would never be so.  She definitely didn't wish to give up her powers for she did like the fact that she was special in that way.    "Morrigan?  Where did your mind take you today?"  Her mother asked quietly as she placed a hand on Morrigan's shoulder.  "I'm sorry, mom.  I am feeling slightly out of sorts today.  I realize that this day is special but I can't help but think about things."  Morrigan squeezed her mom's hand before looking out the door again.  "Why don't you go for a quick walk before our meal.  It will be ready in fifteen minutes but that is time enough for a walk and fresh air.  You have been holed up here all day practicing the craft so now is your time."  Her mother pushed her out the door without any say so Morrigan moved away from the hut.  Before she had moved ten steps, Aidan called out.  "Morrigan, wait up."  Morrigan waited for Aidan to catch up.  He was her best friend and always seemed to be around when she was either into trouble or feeling sad.  Maybe he had some craft inside him as well.  She smiled.  "Hello Aidan.  How is your family?"  Morrigan asked politely.  "They are well and how is your mother?"  Aidan also asked politely.  "She is well.  How have your day been?"  Again very polite.  "My day has been good.  Today was such a nice day that I thought I would see you but I didn't.  What have you been doing all day?"  Aidan asked forgoing the niceties.  "Oh, I have been busy learning cures from my mother so I am stuck to the hut during the day while I learn though every now and then we get to come outside to pick herbs in the woods."  Morrigan answered with a practiced lie that seemed to work over the years.  "That's good to learn medicine.  You will be able help the villagers just like your mother."  Aidan said with a smile.    "Morrigan, come back inside and eat."  Morrigan's Mother yelled from the hut.    "Talk to you later Aidan.  Have a good night."  Morrigan smiled as she turned back to the hut.  "Good night to you as well."  Aidan moved away quietly.  Morrigan walked into the hut and sat down to eat the supper meal with complete silence with another plate on the table for any otherworldly visitors tonight.  She smiled at her mother before eating quietly thinking of the past.    To my husband

      Cell phones are out of the question. Planes too. Maybe a monorail? She didn't know how to do this. How does one hide from a corporation? She needed to get a hold of Brett. She hoped he got out okay.  She headed for the next cafe for coffee and a computer. She would have to contact him in some manner and find out where he was going to go. Possibly they could hook up and help each other out. She definitely didn't have a clue about hiding in reality. She could hide all day in VR as long as she could eat in between but reality. Scary.  She sat down with a nice hot cup of coffee in front of a not-so-old terminal. The place looked like it was from the early twenty-first century but as long as they didn't ask for ID she was happy. She quickly checked through different forums for any kind of news but she didn't see anything new. Now time to e-mail him a quick note from an anonymous mailbox using a complex code of some sort to let him know that it was her. She hoped he would check his mail. Maybe she should check hers. After she wrote him so that way they couldn't find her right away.  She wrote "Brett, I am ready for that wild weekend you promised me. Write me back soonest and let me know where to meet you." There that should work, she hoped.  She quickly scrambled to her mailbox but didn't see anything from Brett. Nothing important except one from corporate. She clicked it and read it quickly. Pretty much it said that she needed to come into the office immediately to discuss security. Like that really convinced her of their intentions.  Quickly she logged off and left the dingy cafe carrying her bag. It was time to leave this city. She would go to the next town down the road to the next cafe and check the e-mail.  She quickly scooted to the monorail station and bought a ticket to the next town. She never heard of it but it should work for her needs.

      A form came out of the darkness frightening her more.  She couldn't see his face in the dark shadows.  She started to inch her way back toward the entrance of the cave away from this new terror.    "Wait.  I won't hurt you.  You just surprised me that's all.  If you follow me I will take you where you can rest and maybe eat something.  Here let me light my lamp."  That quick there was a flare in the darkness and a lamp brightened up the area.  It was a large cave and the light didn't even light the ceiling or some of the other walls.    She looked at her host.  He was young possibly a few years older than her with short dark brown hair and a few inches taller than her.  "Come,"  He said as he moved off towards the back of the cave with the lamp.  She definitely didn't want to be left in the dark so she hurried after him taking care not to hurt her ankle more.  She still couldn't see very much of the cave but at least she wasn't alone.  Now she hoped that he wasn't a mean sort of person.  She sighed.  How did her life get to be so tangled.  Finally she could see a wall with a large hole that must lead to this place he spoke of to her.  As he moved closer with the light she could see some chairs and a couch.  She could even see a bed and a table.  Who was he to live in such luxury?    "Come in and make yourself at home.  I don't have much but what is mine is yours.  Please sit and I'll get you some water.  Sorry I don't have anything else.  Would you like something to eat?"  He asked as he lit a few other lamps throughout the room.    "Water is fine, thank you.  Yes, I would like something to eat."  She looked around the room slowly.  He must have carved out a living here in this cave for a long time.  Everything had a place and it certainly didn't look crowded.  it was very cozy.  The bed was against the far wall opposite of the door.  The table and chairs sat  right at the door and a kitchen with a fireplace and cupboards laid against the wall with the door.  A couch type object sat across the room from her.  It looked strange with multicolored material covering it.    "Here you are."  He placed a mug filled with water on the table in front of her.  "I'll make something for us to eat.  Why don't you tell me how you ended up in my cave especially since not many people can find it."  She took a long drink before looking into his nice green eyes.  She felt that she could trust him with her deepest secrets and she couldn't say why.  He instilled such trust within her and she felt protected here in this cave.  Strange.  "I am from the village and well I was born with red hair so that makes me a witch, I guess.  Anyways there has been a lot of bad luck running through the village and of course they blamed me and well I ran for it.  They chased me.  I turned my ankle and I had to find a place to hide.  I saw your cave and that's how I ended here."  "Wow.  What an adventure.  You must be very hungry and tired.  How is your ankle?  Would you like me to take a look at it and maybe wrap it tightly so it won't hurt?"  While he listened he started making dinner but looked at her as he made his offer.    "It's throbbing."  She admitted quietly.  "I'll take a look at it after you get something to eat.  So tell me, are you really a witch?"  She looked up quickly to catch a smile.    She smiled in return.  "No I am not a witch.  I have no magical power or else I could heal my ankle myself."  She laughed a little.

      "Well I am the Duke's son though at the moment I am starting page training so I guess I'll be busy for a while. Anyways I was told to find you because you would be one of my teachers though I didn't know you was a girl just a little older than I. Why is that?" The boy asked thoughtfully.  "You will be the only student. I am to teach you how to meditate and to control your emotions and actions." Alecka replied quietly as she slowly walked back to the castle.  "Oh. Father did mention something about my err endless supply of energy. I didn't realize he would make me learn to err control it?" He sighed.  "Well we won't start until your other duties start. We will meet for one hour a day right after the last meal. I will tell you now that your rank will mean nothing to me and will mean nothing to the other instructors. I doubt we will have any problems, correct?" Alecka stopped and looked at him assessing his reactions.  "Nah, there won't be any problems. Well maybe with sitting still. I seem to be able to keep moving for hours and hours and it's even hard for me to fall asleep sometimes at night. It always seems like there is something else for me to do or explore." He said with a grin.

      She sat with her back against the oak tree with eyes shut as she tried to meditate. She tried to relax her body and picture herself as a flower blooming slowly petal by petal. Suddenly a hand touched her shoulder yelling "Hey" at the same time. She jumped up, looked around until her eyes laid upon a boy beside her. Quickly she calmed her breathing and her nerves.  "Who are you and why did you just do that?" She demanded with her hands on her waist waiting for an answer.  "Sorry. I thought you fell asleep and I wanted to get your attention." The boy answered quickly with a smile. "My name is Tom. What's yours?"  "I was meditating." She sighed. "My name is Alecka. How did you find me?"  "Oh one of the servants told me that you would be out here in the garden and if I saw you that I was to remind you about something."  "Oh no I am in trouble again." Alecka complained as she ran for the castle.  "No you're not. You can't be. You didn't do anything, did you?" The boy huffed as he kept up with her.  "But I don't understand. I thought a servant was looking for me?" Alecka stopped dead in her tracks and looked at the boy as he stopped five feet in front of her.  He trotted back before replying. "Nah, you're fine. It doesn't matter if they are looking for you because you're with me." He said smugly as he pointed at himself.  Alecka raised her eyebrow wondering who he really was. "And just who are you that it doesn't matter if I am with you?"

      He whistled as he walked through the woods. He had a quiet walk that seemed to walk on air for no branches or leaves broke nor rustled. The only sounds were a few birds chirping as they looked for food and a few squirrels chattering in the background. These were an old woods with large trees and old ground cover. The leaves whispered as he walked by each seeming to pass the word along that there was someone in the forest.  He was dressed in loose pants that seemed to flow with his body and a light shirt for the summer days. He carried a pack on his shoulder and his hair seemed a little long and touched his shoulders with each sway of his body. He seemd unnaturally pale or possibly a different skin color altogether for it seemd that the sun had never touched his face nor his arms. His eyes had a foreign touch almost as if he was a cat with satisfied slanted eyes.

      "Whatcha doing?" A boy's voice floated through her mind dragging her from her perfect moment and place back to reality. She jerked her eyes open and looked around for the voice. "Over here."  She looked toward the fence and saw a boy hanging over it watching her with curious eyes. "I was meditating." She said quickly in hopes that it would put him off and make him go away.  Apparently it didn't work. "What is meditating?" He asked with the same expression.  She sighed. "Mediatation is a way in which a person can relax and control their breathing in hope of understanding this world." She stood up and slapped her jeans to knock the grass off. She was sitting under a small tree in hopes that no one could see her and wonder at her actions. No such luck.  "That's weird. You must be a weird girl. What is your name? I'm Tommy and I just turned ten years old. How old are you? I am staying here for the summer. Do you mind if I play with you? There is nothing to do at my grandma's house. My parents are too busy for me to stay at home this summer. What about you?"  Alecka took a deep breath for him. She certainly hoped he wouldn't ask questions all summer or it could be very interesting. "Nice to meet you, Tommy. My name is Alecka and I just turned eleven myself. I don't mind if you want to play though it will have to be after my studies."  "Don't you get a summer break? That would be awful. I don't like school. Kids pick on me and I don't like that. I do like to read though. Do you like to read?" He leaned even futher across the fence.  Alecka hoped he didn't fall over the fence. She took another breath to answer the next set of questions. "No I don't get a summer break. I am taught at home on a more advanced rate and I like to read myself. What is your favorite book?" She asked a question before he could. She felt a small achievement for this success. It should definitely prove to be an interesting summer.  "I like adventures like Treasure Island and Tom Sawyer. What about you? Have you read those books?" He asked eagerly.  "Yeah, those books are great. I'll have to show you my collection in case you want to borrow some over the summer to read."  "Oh that would be excellent. My grandma doesn't have much. Like I said it is boring here." He scrunched his face as he said that.  "Why don't you come inside for some cookies and milk? Will that be all right?" Alecka asked quietly as she led the way to the front of the yard to the gate.  "Let me just run in quickly and let her know and I'll be right over." With that he bounded away to the house and Alecka opened the gate and sat on the porch to wait.  In a few minutes he bounded out of the house and ran through the gate. "She says it's fine. She knows your mom and dad and she says that they are good people."  "Well come in then. My mom is working in her office so we'll have to be quiet in the kitchen." Alecka led the way into the house.

      Alecka just knew she was in trouble.  She was late for supper and completely dirty.  There was not one clean patch of skin or clothing on her.  Her mom will be so mad that she will be grounded for at least a week.    She ran up the steps to the back porch.  She hoped she could sneak into the bathroom and wash off before getting caught.  She looked up at the screen door and reached her hand out to the handle when she noticed the shadowy figure.  "Oh hi Mom,"  Alecka said lamely as she took a step back from the door.  "What happened this time?  Why are you so covered with mud?"  Her Mom came out onto the porch for a better look at her muddy daughter.  "Nothing Mom,"  Alecka looked down at her shoes as she replied.  She couldn't face her mom with the truth that the kids at school pushed her down into the mud.  After she got up, they threw mud balls at her making things even worse.   "Well start taking off your shoes and socks and anything else you can spare.  I'll grab a towel for you hide behind so you can take the rest off.  I will not have you come into the house with all of that mud.  You will then wash off and come down to eat.  It's a good thing I was a little late in starting supper so it won't be cold by the time you are finished."  Alecka hurried and took off her shoes and socks.  She took off her jacket which took the most damage.  Her shirt for the most part still looked blue instead of muddy brown.  Her Mom came back silently and held the towel up so she could take off her shorts.  Alecka ran into the house and up the stairs without looking back.  She hurried into her bedroom and grabbed some clothes before heading for the shower.  The shower seemed to wash much of the bad feelings away as well as the mud.  She felt cleansed again in a way that made her happy to be home.  Unfortunately she had to jump out and make her way downstairs for a very uncomfortably silent meal with her Mom.    "Well sit down and start eating." Her Mom said as Alecka appeared in the kitchen doorway.    Alecka sat down quickly looking at the menu of corn, chicken, mashed potatoes, and gravy.  Her favorite food.  Mom sat down across from her and sat their drinks in front of their plates.  "Dig in before it gets cold.  Eat as much as you like.  You know how much I hate left overs.  I don't know why I made so much tonight.  You would think I was expecting company or something."  Her Mom shook her head as she spooned some corn onto her plate.  "The last time you did this, Mom, Grandma came to stay for a while." Alecka commented as she forked a piece of chicken onto her plate with the mashed potatoes and gravy.  At that precise moment the doorbell rang loudly through the house.  Mom sighed and placed her utensils on the table.  "That would be your Grandmother.  Wait here and I'll bring her back.  Can you grab another plate?"

      She watched him fidget as she tried to speak in a calming voice and help him breathe.  This was going to be difficult.  He couldn't even sit still for five minutes let alone a whole hour.  She sighed inwardly as she counted out loud for him to follow.  He couldn't even keep his eyes closed for more than a few seconds.  "Tom, look at me.  What are you thinking about?"  She finally demanded.  "I was wondering how much longer we'll be.  I have so much work to get started on for tomorrow."  He said quickly.  "Homework hour is not for another thiry minutes.  Right now you need to be working on breathing in a pattern and clearing your mind.  If you do not learn this you will be considered hopeless as a page, a squire, and a knight.  Do you want to go home in disgrace?"    His eyes widened.  "I didn't realize that.  I thought this was some stupid exercise that my father is making me do.  I never thought I could be sent home if I don't learn to control myself.  Is that really true?"    "Yes it is.  They told that you had to learn to be patient and calm.  It was up to me to settle you before the real training begins.  Now we'll stop for the night but think of your actions.  We'll start over tomorrow night with something different."  She stood up and wiped her pants off and turned toward the castle.    "Alecka, I'll try harder tomorrow night."  With that announcement he was off for the dormitories in a dash.  She shook her head.  She had no idea how to keep his attention on this task.  She definitely was going to have to start with minutes and build the way to longer intervals.  He just had too much energy to be constrained in any manner.  Tomorrow was looking more and more like torture.

         He whispered her name in a litany almost as if he were praying to a god for gratification.  He wished he could hear her calming voice wash over him like water cleaning away the dirt and grime. He needed her now like a hot desert yearns for the cooling touch or rain.  Only she can chase his demons back to where they belong in the deepest, deepest depths of hell.  She was his light at the end of the longest darkest tunnel, his savior through his darkened hours of darkened misery.    His whitened fingers gripped the bed on each side.  His body laid taunt as a board on top of the blankets.  The room laid in darkness with the light of the moon shining through the window.  He stared past his body out the window without blinking his eyes for fear of missing something vital.    A shadow glided across the window causing the room to darken blocking the light of the moon.  He gasped in surprise, his litany stopped for a moment before he started once more.      "Honey, did you see that owl just now out the window.  It was huge."  His wife walked into the room carrying a glass of water.    He quickly sat up and calmed his breathing, "Why, yes dear, I did see something fly by."  He took her in his arms and lay down to sleep.  An owl?  He shook his head.

      Alecka jumped and grabbed a plate from the cupboard.&nbsp; She loved when her grandma came and visited for a while.&nbsp; Grandma knew so many stories and fun things to do.&nbsp; She grabbed some utensils from the drawer before rushing back to the table to place them beside between Mom and herself.&nbsp; She heard them moving to the kitchen talking and laughing.&nbsp; &nbsp; Grandmother entered the kitchen with a huge smile with Mom behind her.&nbsp; "Grandma!"&nbsp; Alecka ran to her grandmother and hugged her tightly around the middle. &nbsp; "Goodness gracious, child.&nbsp; I haven't been gone that long.&nbsp; Now let's sit down and finish supper and you can tell me everything new in your life."&nbsp; Alecka felt Grandma hold her tightly for a moment before pushing her toward her chair at the table.&nbsp;

      She was born with hair like fire and eyes like grass both curses upon her. Her mother hid the red by dying but there was nothing she could do with the green eyes. She only hoped no one would realize the girl also had red hair. Red hair is a banner for her family. An unwelcome banner that told all the heritage of her family. Witches. Each and every woman born with red hair and green eyes within her family was a witch. Fortunately there was never more than three or four women alive at one time. They learned to hide it well throughout the decades.   Morrigan, her mother named her for better or worse for that was the name of the goddess of battle.&nbsp; Battle may be what she has to learn to prepare for in the future.&nbsp; No doubt that one day someone will find out that she is a witch and she must be able to withstand the ridicule and hardship ahead.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Luckily her mother was also a witch with red hair and green eyes.&nbsp; Of course her mother taught her everything that she learned from her aunt many years ago.&nbsp; Her family has very old roots that go to the beginning of the new country traced even further back to the old country. &nbsp; "Witch."&nbsp; The whispers of the town folk behind and even in front of their faces hurt them for they would never mean any harm though there was that aunt who&nbsp;cursed a woman for starting the rumors.&nbsp; But that of course is the&nbsp;exception or is it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Morrigan thought as&nbsp;she pretended to read a book at the table.&nbsp;  &nbsp; She didn't go to&nbsp;the school house like the other children.&nbsp;&nbsp;She stayed home to learn the basic subjects as well as wiccan ones.&nbsp; She sighed.&nbsp; Sometimes it was neat to realize what kind of powers she had and then it was horrible to think of how she will be treated for the rest of her life.&nbsp; She wondered how she would have babies of her own.&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Drip, drip, drip went the rain on the roof above her small room.&nbsp; She listened to the rain patter outside onto the street and the silence within the building.&nbsp; She laid on her bed with her legs curled up and her head laying on top of her hands.&nbsp; She didn't know how long she laid in that manner but she knew the sun had come up and gone down already.&nbsp; She didn't really care anymore though.&nbsp; Why should she.&nbsp; At least that is how she felt at the moment.&nbsp; Nothing could budge her from her bed not even to eat or take a shower.&nbsp; Now going to the bathroom was another matter.&nbsp; She couldn't just do in her bed.&nbsp; Gross.&nbsp; Life does eventually go on or at least that is what everyone says possibly just to be in denial.&nbsp;She sighed. &nbsp; She sat up and walked into the kitchen.&nbsp; She grabbed a bagel and some milk.&nbsp; Life does go on eventually even after a breakup of five years.
