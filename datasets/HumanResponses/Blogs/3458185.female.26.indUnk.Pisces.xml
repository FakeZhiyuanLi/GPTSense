      Ok, last night my nephew J slept over since he had a dental appt to attend.  He's only in daycare- so it was no big deal to have him just hang out here with the munchkin and chill.  I woke up this morning to the noise of toys banging and my sister M telling the kids to stop making a mess.  LOL- honestly, if you're a parent or have been around small children, you know that there's really no point in asking a 2 1/2 and 3 yr old to stop making a mess.  What you need to do is make sure they clean it up after they are done playing.  Anyways, so I decided to roll out of bed  (it was 11am!) and head downstairs.  After eating breakfast- I got the munchkin ready while my sis got my nephew ready.  Once they were all showered and such, I decided it was best if me and the munchkin stay behind to wait for my eldest nephew R to get out of HS.  He also had an appt with the dentist along side his other brother K.  My sister left with J to go pick up K from preschool.  After almost getting lost, she calls me to confirm that she's got the two younger boys and is on her way to the dental office and that I'm to tell R to haul ass once he gets here to meet them on time.    Appx 2:50 he finally arrives.  I'm pretty irritated cuz he goes to school some 10 minutes away and knows damn well that he's got a 3pm appt.  Needless to say, I meet him at the door and tell him to head off to the office.  Not even a minute later, my sister calls to tell me to tell R nevermind cuz the idiot receptionist had messed up the days and set their appt for Tuesday (yesterday) as opposed to the only day R has off which is today.  So I run out..but it's too late, he's already gone.  As I'm telling my sister that he's already gone, she stops me and is yelling to the receptionist at the office...  "What did you say?  I don't appreciate your lil attitude.  That's it, let's take this outside!  Come on!"  Then dial tone.  Oh no.  I know that tone and she's pretty pissed.  I try calling my nephew on his cell but was greeted with instant voicemail.  So I call my sister back.  I find out that she's ready to beat this receptionist to a pulp and is waiting in her car for her to get off.    Apparently the girl told my sister that had she (my sister) written it down on her calendar..she wouldn't have gotten the days mixed up.  Well, it's clearly written on my sister's calendar for today, and it being a Wednesday- the only day my nephew R has off during the week, she knows that the mistake is on the incompetent receptionist.  Now you have to understand although my sister is nice person, she goes ballistic if someone messes with her.  Now picture a woman, 5'2 weighing no more than 120 climbing over the counter in anger towards this receptionist who was apparently glued to her chair.  I would've just loved to see this.  Of course, it's unfortunate that the younger boys had to see her this way- but man oh man, I must say that the receptionist was lucky the boys were there- else she would've for sure gotten a good beaten and my sister would've probably been taken away by the cops.    I know how my sister can get- she may be small, but def. is not  afraid of getting into a fight.    Anyways, she was able to calm down and head home to pick me and the munchkin up for a snack.  While on the way to Mc'ds we stopped at my other sister J (children's mom)house.  We pulled up behind my nephew R who ended up backing his car into us.  I thought to myself, oh no- not something else!  To my surprise my sister remained as calm as possible.  My nephew apologized and sped off, in fear I'm sure.  Amazingly nothing happened to her SUV other than a scratch.  After telling my sister J what happened, we all went to Olympia mall to get some stuff.    We had dinner there- nothing to extravagant- just panda express.  I always get the mandarin bowl there cuz it's just so yummy.  After the mall, we all headed back to my sister J's house to hang out and chit chat.    All in all, it was a good day despite it's events.  One thing is def. for sure.  I think I'll be taking the kids to their next doc's appointment.  After all, I know I am much calmer than my sister M.  Ok, I'm tired now.  Til next time...

      So I was watching the Discover Health Channel- Birth Day and there was a woman on who seemed to have everyone in her delivery room.  Everyone meaning her father, mother, sister, cousins..her hubby's family, etc.  I was pretty surprised by how many ppl were there to witness the birth of her child.  I mean, it's great and all..but really.  To have that many ppl?  Your father no less?  Um, Eww.    Watching it reminded me of when I gave birth to my munchkin.  However, I wasn't as lucky as the woman on TV.  I didn't have anyone other than my boyfriend at the time there with me.  No one came to see me, not even my bestfriend after I made several calls.  To make matters worse, right after I had my lil girl, my boyfriend (on the advice of my supervisor at work) decided to go home and sleep for 12 hours.  On top of that..he turned off his cell phone and the home phone.  Who the hell does that?  Hello!  I had to have an emergency c-section so I couldn't even roll over to pick my lil girl up when she started crying.  I had to call the nurses on several occasions to come and help me pick my lil girl up cuz no one was there.  Just my tiny baby and I.  Ironic how it's just her and I now.  You think that I would've seen what was so plainly infront of me.  Anyways I won't go into how the first few days of her life were the most enjoyable yet the most lonesome time of my life, but I will say that I left after only 48 hours in the hospital.  I couldn't take hearing the cries of joy in the other rooms as family members and friends came to welcome the new bundle of joy in other's lives, but no one came to visit me other than 2 co-workers to welcome my lil girl.  My mom didnt' even show up.  My best friend finally came over to my apt to see my lil girl after 3 weeks.  At that point I wasn't taking any of her calls- I was just too hurt.  But she stopped by anyways.  It took a lot, but I forgave her.  I didn't want to have hate in my heart.  Wow, now that I've relived the whole experience again, I think I'm gonna go and cry for a bit.  I may come back and blog later..or I may not.  Someone please remind me to not watch BirthDay ever again...

      Ok, so let's see...  I know that I was pretty vague with my previous blog so let me enlighten.  During the past week, I've started my daughter in daycare so that I can dedicate my time looking for a job - full time.  Things with that have been pretty good.  I really like her teachers, both Miss Kathleen and Miss Nicci.  Great gals!  Did I mention that my mom and my younger cousin now live with me and my sis?  If not, now I have :).  It's great having them here.  We're just one big happy family.  However, I'm reminded that I really have to work at getting myself a job so that I can move out ang get my own place so that I'm not just moochin' off my sister and her hubby for too long.    They've been really wonderful- opening their home to all of us.  I really want to do something really nice for them once I'm on my feet again :).  Perhaps I'll pay for a weekend bed and breakfast at one of the many islands here.  Who knows.  I'm sure they'd love it.  I was thinking about doin that for their anniversary next month so we'll see.  Anyways- today was a pretty uneventful day.  I mainly lounged around the house..then got a bug up my butt to clean my room tonight.  I'm currently taking a break from that since I was feeling a bit ..tired.  Getting online always wakes me up.  Ok, I think I'mma go back to cleaning.  Til next time...

Anyways- Happy Bday R!!! Ok, the past week I've been actively looking for a job here in Lacey.  I have a few interesting prospects..so let's just hope that they find me just as interesting ;).  Pres. Regan died today.  I'm sad.    Not much else to say right now ..so I'mma go.  Peace out :)

      Wow, for committing myself to blog at least once a week, I'm falling behind.    I have so much to blog about and no patience to go into it.  I will say that these past weeks have been quite busy.  The weather here has been sooooo nice, I am just loving WA!!!  Although I miss my buds out in AZ tremendously.  I have made a new pal outside of my immediate family- she reminds me a lot of a friend I had back in phx- Marni.  She's hilarious!  Anyhoo...  Hmm, the munchkin is doing great- her vocab has improved ten fold.  She continues to amaze me everyday with new words (Peace out) and full on sentences.  Father's day came and went- we called her daddy - he was thrilled.  I called my pops- it was good to talk with him.  I miss him tons!  Love ya dad!!!!  Hmm, my sister had a bday- her 25TH!  Talk about drama- remind me to get into that later.  Other than that...things are back on the normal side of weird.  This weekend I have a wedding reception to attend, I'm thinking about taking the kids to the circus and going out dancing.  Damn! It's been way too long since I've had a DIVA NIGHT.  FOr those of you whom don't know- Diva Night is basically a girls' night out.  Dancing, drinking (maybe) and tons of fun :)  OK- I think my dinner is done- or should I call it a midnight snack?  I can't seem to figure out why, but I'm eating dinner later and later these days.  Perhaps one day I'll just do away with it all together.  Oh wait a minute.  I'm a mommy- I can't do away with dinner.  Aight, I'm rambling if you can't tell- so I'mma cut here. "peace out". R.

      Ok, I know that I'm 26 years old and that this is going to sound really stupid- but I finally know what I want to be.  Dun Dun Dun Duuuuunnn....  A pharmacist!  Yep.  Can you imagine me a pharmacist?  I had a really bad day on Monday.  I mean BAAAD.  I was regretting coming to WA and the whole shabang.  Well, I spent the better part of last night online researching what it means and what it will take to become a pharmacist.  I've always been interested in the field (medical and pharmacology) but I never really took any of it seriously- til about a year ago.  I know that I enrolled into DeVry- but after a couple of semesters, I just thought..eh- Business..no biggy.    Now that I've decided that I'm going to work towards being a pharmacist- I'm totally excited.  I finally have a game plan.  Something that I know I will completely see through.  I'm completely stoked!    Ok, I'll go into it a bit later- the wine I had earlier has tired me out!  Gotta run, Peace out. R.

      Yesterday I went out with my older sister and two of her friends.  Talk about fun fun!  We ate at this mexican joint. Azteca or something like that in Tacoma.  Anyways, guess how much the bill was for some rice and beans w/steak?  Somewhere between $40-$50?  For the four of us?  Try $98!  I was like, WTF!!!! Man oh Man.  Good thing my sister was treating me :)  Side thought:  Our waiter wanted to see my ID when I ordered a strawberry margarita (macho!).  I was like, hmm..sure, but I'm 26!  I was a bit annoyed.  Most women feel complimented if asked for ID, I on the other hand am just annoyed.  Can I see your ID??  Give me a break!  Anyways, after that we hit this casino out in ... hmm, what was the city?  I forget, but it was , fuck!  now I can't remember the name of the casino.  Oh well, it was some casino towards seattle- not like that's gonna help cuz there are so many casinos out here.  Ok, back to the point... we went out there to check out the dance club upstairs.  On our way there..we saw that they were putting on a firework display- which was nice.  After 5 mins, it was over and we walk inside.  As soon as I walk in..I'm asked to provide ID.  WTH???  Hello ppl!  Twice in one night- ridiculous!  Trust me when I say that I look every bit of 26.  Good thing I had that margarita at dinner- else I would've been like, NO. :)  So we go upstairs to the dance club.  It was really nice.  Lounge tables off to the side, a nice size dance floor, an entire wall dedicated to the vain (a huge mirror).  Don't stop til you get enough by Micheal Jackson is playing.  I'm feeling the beat, but stay back a bit- I need a shot of tequila.  I decide to order water though when the waitress comes by as I can see that my sister's two friends weren't feeling the joint.  We sat back and watched this drag queen dance on the floor, checking her/mself in the mirror the entire time, while flippin his/her weave.  LMAO!  I was like, see that woman?  Everyone was like, yeah- she's tall!  I was like, that's cuz she is a man.  They were like, no way.  I was like yup.  Come on ppl!  Don't you know I'm from Phoenix?  HOme of the great Barbra Seville?  Barbra I miss you!!!  I dont' know if there are any gay bars w/drag's out here.  I find that the area I'm living in is seriously on the boring side.  I mean, if you want to get out- you've gotta seriously get out to a different city.  Else you're just gonna end up at safeway.  OMG that's another thing about this city that literally cracks me up.  You know Walgreens?  Well, safeway is the Walgreen of WA.  That is that there is one on practically every corner.  No JOKE!  IN this town alone, I've counted.. 4 w/in a 10 mile radius.  I am not shitting you.  Crack me up!    Wow, I'm really off track.  Ok, tonight I went to a firework show that was held near tarje'.  It was pretty good, my munchkin and nephews loved it.  I swear they were screaming the loudest WHOA's and AH's.  Ppl kept turning around to look at us.  I was like - Yup, that's muh girl *hugs*.  I wonder where she gets that from :P  I just love fireworks.  Saw some on fri, some tonight and will be going on post to see the display with my family.  I'm totally looking forward to it.  The fourth on any fort is freakin awesome!  Ok.  I should end here.  I think I've babbled enough.  Let me know how your fourth went, and I'll blog how mine goes.  Tootles! R.

      Hey.&nbsp; It's been a while.&nbsp; Anyways, hope all is goin well.&nbsp; As for me, things are on the up and up.&nbsp; I'll get into that a little later.&nbsp; Right now, it's appx 4 am and I can't sleep.&nbsp; I decided to read&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;friends websites&nbsp;to catch up&nbsp;on the latest since&nbsp;I'm HORRIBLE at calling ppl (not that they can't call me&nbsp;*hint, hint*).&nbsp; Anyways-&nbsp;surprisingly the subject that people seem to be most fascinated&nbsp;with-&nbsp;is marriage.&nbsp; Yes, the M word.&nbsp;&nbsp;I read about a friend talking about a certain girl being the one that he might&nbsp;take the stroll down that long aisle with (I agree, dont' mess this one up&nbsp;kiddo) - another who wonders what she needs to do to get her bf to pop the&nbsp;question (hello!&nbsp; it's been&nbsp;5 years!&nbsp; shit or get off the pot!).&nbsp; There was one particular persons ramblings that I found ...almost disturbing.&nbsp; This particular person talked about marriage, having children and stuff of that nature.&nbsp; It wasn't the text that was disturbing to me, but&nbsp;rather the fact&nbsp;that this was coming from&nbsp;*him*.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Perhaps I should&nbsp;just give you&nbsp;a quick run down of the fellow.&nbsp; He's a great guy- good moral and family values.&nbsp; An active member of the church and community.&nbsp; He's got a good head on his shoulders, at 26 has a good job, his own house,&nbsp;car, tight group of friends.&nbsp; You get the idea.&nbsp; Everything that I'd want in a potential bf.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,&nbsp;IF&nbsp;I wanted a bf which by the way I do not.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyhoo,&nbsp;as I'm reading&nbsp;his ramblings, I'm thinking-&nbsp;what the hell?&nbsp; Where was this insightful individual while I was around?&nbsp; Clearly the boy has done some growing up- or looking in.&nbsp; Or has he?&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm starting to think that&nbsp;maybe I didn't know him as well as I thought.&nbsp; I&nbsp;only&nbsp;got to see&nbsp;a little of that in him.&nbsp; I mean, as I&nbsp;mentioned, I know that he's&nbsp;got a good heart and was raised right- but&nbsp;he was&nbsp;holding back a lot of himself.&nbsp;&nbsp; I suspected this while I was seeing him, but now I'm certain of it.&nbsp;   I question why&nbsp;he wouldn't&nbsp;want to share those aspects of his life with me.&nbsp;&nbsp;This leads me to believe that he found me inept and/or unworthy of getting close to him.&nbsp; A friend once told me that I'm&nbsp;unapproachable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even to those&nbsp;who know me.&nbsp; Naturally I was taken back by&nbsp;her comment, but was she right?&nbsp; Do I really send out this message?&nbsp; Perhaps it is  I  who needs to do some self analyzing. &nbsp;Not that I haven't done enough of it in the last year.&nbsp; I mean, I'm in WA now.&nbsp; I moved from my beloved AZ and all my wonderful friends to get back on track. &nbsp;  A few things that I know for sure.&nbsp; I know that if  I  were the person today that I've always wanted to be when I was younger- someone with the shit together- he probably would've shared a lot more with me.&nbsp; I'm sure of this.&nbsp; I guess he nailed it when he said "I guess it essentially boils down to whether or not I'm happy with who I am."&nbsp;Perhaps the message I put out there isn't that I am unapproachable, but that I am unhappy with who I am.  It's like that movie- Under the Tuscan Sun.&nbsp; Only when she was happy and complete did she finally have everything that she wanted.&nbsp; Here I am starting all over again at 26.&nbsp; TWENTY-SIX!&nbsp; I never thought I'd be here.&nbsp; When I was younger- I had my whole life planned out.&nbsp; I was gonna graduate HS in 96, go to UA to become a teacher and be part of class of 00.&nbsp; I was gonna meet the man of my dreams somewhere while in college, get hitched between 22-24.&nbsp; Wait a few years, move near family in CA and have 2-3 kids between the ages of 28-32 and live happily ever after.&nbsp; Boy life turned out to be completely different.&nbsp; Would I do it differently if I could turn back time?&nbsp; At times I wish I could, but if ever given the chance, I'd most likely pass it up otherwise I wouldn't have the most precious and dearest person in my life- muh munchkin.&nbsp; She's the only thing that keeps me from going crazy although at times she drives me up the wall.&nbsp; She's the reason why I have to wake up each morning not kicking myself too badly for the things that I've done&nbsp;or not done.&nbsp; She's a constant reminder that no matter what happens, no matter where life takes me, things will turn out for themselves and I thank God everyday for blessing me with her.  OK, back to the subject:&nbsp; I've discovered that I'm fascinated with this buddy cuz he encompasses all the qualities that I'd like to possess.&nbsp; Not to say that I don't have good morals and family values - cuz I do.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's just that I've found (and I'm sure most of you will agree) that it's the things you  DIDN'T  do that you regret the most in life.&nbsp;&nbsp; So here are a few things that I'm going to work on:   1.) Completing college  2.) Getting active in the community and church  3.) Staying in touch with my true and dear pals  &nbsp;  along with a few other things.  Hopefully once I have these 3 major goals accomplished then I'll be able to get the guy.&nbsp; I know it most likely won't be *him* (although I wouldn't complain if it happened) but someone who was just right for me and vice versa.&nbsp; Damn it's almost 5am.&nbsp; I miss Phoenix.&nbsp; I miss my pops.&nbsp; I miss my pals.&nbsp; Being here has made me more aware of just how lucky I am to have made such great pals back home.&nbsp; I really need to work on staying in touch.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I'll make a few phone calls home today.&nbsp; Or perhaps just some e-mails.&nbsp; I'm off to shower and get ready for the day.&nbsp;   *Yawn*

      So, it's been an interesting week. I've had training from 6am-3pm everyday this week. Talk about YAY-FUN! It's midnight- I can't sleep- I'm freezing my tail off! I swear if WA is this cold in AUG, I'm gonna be in big trouble! Funny story: This morning I got up and decided to wear a thick sweater and long coat- I walk into my training class and get bombarded by questions like,  "Damn girl! Where do you think you are? Alaska?" ... Nicole My comment: "Honey, I'm from Phoenix. It sure feels like Alaska here!"  "Hey I think you left your snowboots over here"...Amy "Um, are you cold?" ...Josh  The folks crack me up! Seriously, while I'm sporting THO people here are sporting shorts and t-shirts. WEIRDOS!  Okay, other than that..it's been an ok week. Nothing new really goin on. Well, nothing that I care to divulge at this point. Perhaps later tomorrow..or sometime this weekend.  My fingers feel numb- I think I should get some sleep- or at least try to. Til next time! Adios!

      Ok, so I had all weekend to call my good ole' pals and let each of them know just how much I appreciate them, give them an update and get one in return on life.&nbsp; Did I?&nbsp; Shamefully no.&nbsp; For trying to accomplish something as simple as STAYING IN TOUCH- I'm doing a terrible job at it.&nbsp; I'm gonna give it another shot tomorrow.&nbsp; I think it's safer for me to just e-mail- or at least commit to e-mail.&nbsp; For some odd reason I suck ass at making phone calls.&nbsp; Yes, I know it's a simple thing to do- pick up phone, dial numbers, press call button, talk- however, for some lame reason I always have a hard time following through on my good intentions.  That said, let me get on to other matters.&nbsp; I don't think that I've mentioned this, but earlier this month my brother and his wife had a lil baby boy named Noah.&nbsp; He looks nothing like my brother but is still as cute as can be.&nbsp; I can't wait to see them for Thanksgiving.&nbsp;   Let's see..what else?&nbsp; Oh, my mother will be leaving for california sometime either this week or next.&nbsp; Apparently my brother down there needs her to help watch his two munchkins.&nbsp; She won't be back until November- which means she'll miss my munchkin's 3rd b-day.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to bother her- so I'll try not to let it bother me.&nbsp; *OK*  Well, I did a lot this weekend.&nbsp; I'll blog that another time since I'm sorta tired right now.&nbsp; Til then..  Take care and God bless! R.  &nbsp;

      I'm back to share a few things that have been on my mind. Since starting this new job- it's taken me a lil bit to get things back in order (i.e. waking up early enough to get myself and my daughter ready). I have to drop her off at my sister J's place at 5:45am. She then hitch's a ride with her Aunty since she goes to the same daycare in which J works. Well, I've been "surfing the crimson wave" since Wednesday and have been having a REALLY hard time getting myself up and running. This has been the case for the last 3 days. I have been running late and basically only have had the time to wake her up, get her dressed and fly out the door to drop her off and race to work. Yes, I've come to the conclusion that I need to wake up at 4:30am to get everything good to go.  Yesterday after work, my other sister (preggo- from NY) said that she thought I should work on waking up earlier since she brushed my daughter's hair for the last  two  days. Yes, I realize this. I politely thanked her for doing so the last few days and went on to say that I realize that I need to wake up a lil earlier than norm to get myself ready so that I have more time to get her ready- and that I was going to start that on Monday. She didn't seem satisfied with this and continued to scold me for HER having to get MY daughter ready. She said that no one should have to do anything for my daughter and shit. First of all, I don't expect anyone to do anything for me. When I drop my daughter off, her hair is brushed- she's got her hair cut in a certain way that looks just fine down- she can go to school like that. But my sister thinks that lil girls' should have their hair up in pigtails or braided at all times.  Ok, 1. I didn't ask her to do it for me. 2. I already thanked her for her assistance and apologized 3. I told her that I realized that it was an issue and that I was going to be waking up much earlier starting next week to avoid any delays and rushes. Don't you think this is enough? Fuck, I mean- it's not like I like my daughter to look disheveled. Plus, are we not family where if I'm running REALLY late- she just can't help me out? I would totally do the same for her if the roles were reversed and have done the same for my other sister J without any complaints. I am bothered by the fact that she said anything at all and the tone she took with me.  She went on to bitch about how my sister J has started to get her shit together and is now getting her two boys ready in the morning without having to wake her up to assist. She said that I shouldn't be dependant on other's to take care of my kid. Her words exactly- "YOUR kid". That really erked me. True, she has a valid point- but her point is for naught since I don't expect ANYONE to take care of my kid other than myself. I am bothered by the fact that she is clearly taking out her frustration with my older sister (in which she can't say anything to according to our custom) on me. WTF did I do? I can't count on my sister to bail me out if I'm in a jam? Certainly I don't plan on making running late to work a ritual. I just needed a few days to get accustomed to the hours again. You'd think she would understand. Hell, we're sisters - aren't we?  I know that she's preggo and all, but pregnancy is no excuse for being outright rude or hateful. Also, I've been a mom for a while, don't fucking lecture me on how to be one when you are only just NOW having your first. Don't forget, I'm doing this on my own for the first time. It's hard being a single parent and not having anyone to share the duties. I don't think she understands this. Being that she will have the luxury of being a stay at home mom since her husband's a high ranking military official, I really think she needs to lay off.  So instead of really letting her know just how I feel about her bitching to me about something that I would do for anyone (sister or not) any day- I have decided to just not hang out with her. If she is so bothered and burdened by me and my girl- then I don't really need or want to be around her. She'll never have to work another day of her life, so she will have no idea just how much effort I put in to being the best mom I can be while juggling working and going to school full time. My sister J knows how it is and has had never had an issue with helping me out when I needed help and I've never had an issue with helping her out in return. I think it's cuz she knows that it's hard at times. Being a parent that is.  I dunno, I guess I'm just going in circles. But I can see that the root of my problem is that I am hurt that she, being my sister, would even be bothered with helping me out. I mean, it only happened twice. TWICE! Not like it's been happening for a long time even. Hell, I know that my bestfriend out in AZ would have no issue helping me out in that aspect had I moved in with her instead of coming here. I know that I wouldn't ever have an issue with helping her if she needed it.  Ugh @ family members like this.
