      today was probably one of the worst days i've ever had. and it only took about a 30 minute arguement to make it that way. yes things suck ass again. not too bad though. it feels like the worlds spinning really fast around me, and its makin me all dizzy and stuff, and i try to keep up, but i can't. yep, thats what it feels like. and it sucks. today i realised that i need to graduate highschool. that means major extra classes at the college, and major extra effort that i'm not willing to give, even though i KNOW that i need to gradute. i'm fucked up like that. my heads fuckin pundind, and my back hurts like a little blonde bitch. i need drugs. i need my favorite friends mary, and jane. i love there company. they rock. they keep me goin when the world gets WAY too crazy. if only everybody would just calm down, and chill. the world would be a much more likable place. yep.yep. it would.

      Everybody walk around with this idea in there head of what my life should be like, and i'm not down with that. they're constantly telling me that i'm fucking up, as if i don't know this already. i have idea's in my head aswell, the way my life should be. i never ever thought i'd end up dropping out, i've went to school for 7 years to throw it all away. they don't think that pisses me off, that i can't make it in highschool. yeah, its sucks. but i can't handle it here. i remember what it was like there. walking around all those stupid people, with there stupid drama, and little status circles. i hated it, i'm WAY above all that shit, it kills me to know some people are all caught up in that stupid shit, i just think about them and laugh, they suck.
