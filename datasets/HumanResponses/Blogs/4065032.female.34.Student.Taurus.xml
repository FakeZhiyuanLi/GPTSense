						   The morning sun rolled up as it usually does in the AM. The alarm interrupted my restless sleeping body only to find itself shut off, no snooze, just off. Why get up early with nothing of importance on the agenda?  When my back could no longer handle the comforts of the bed, I stumbled out of the room and began the morning routine. I showered, brushed my teeth, got dressed, popped open a can of diet coke, grabbed a cigarette and quietly went outside. The morning smoking session was usually when I saw the most action at the swallow nest. Then I froze, turned statuesque right there in front of the door. The nest was empty.  For some reason, I couldn't believe it. Maybe there was still a baby in the bottom. Once I finally accepted that the nest was empty, I quickly, almost in a panic, scanned the yard for the young ones. Nothing. Just like that, my family was gone.  I sat in the chair, which was warmed by the sun, and smoked my nicotine breakfast. It seemed as though nature was silent and still, waiting for me to catch up with what had happened. Finally, I started to look around, really look, for the family. I think they had perched themselves in the swampy grass several yards away from me; a pair of adult swallows would swoop through the "wetlands," and near a particularly large clump of Brown-Eyed Susans came a loud, energy draining squeak, squeak, squeak.  I spent most of the day waiting for the babies to come back home, like the first one who took flight the day before. In the afternoon, as if to tell me that everything was fine, an adult did the traditional loop into my deck space and gave me a quick tweet. Perhaps they knew that I wasn't a fan of good-byes.  At one point, late in the day, a baby came flying by the nest. I thought it would go right in there, but an adult was close behind, poking at it and delivering some kind of advice. I suspect it was something like, "Don't you dare go back in that nest." The two "J"ed their way back to tall grass where I lost sight of them.  During the evening walk with the dog, a very large bird flew over the top of us. I stopped and watched it in amazement. Was it a duck? No, too big for a duck. Was it a Great Blue Heron? No, wrong shape for a Heron. Maybe a goose. Then it occurred to me (almost bringing a tear and a smile), my swallows were really gone, and I missed them.  Perhaps the last of the bird lessons:  Missing the morning hours is not always the best choice.  Sometimes, as hard as it is, parents must urge their young to leave the nest and encourage them to not return.  Even though you've learned to fly, it doesn't mean you can't squeak at your parents for help.

						   Often, I&nbsp;hesitantly made my way to the back glass door in the morning.&nbsp; My biggest fear with my bird friends was that I would wake up to find evidence of an unsuccessful flight attempt.&nbsp; I suffered through several baby bird deaths at my house in Missouri and was not wanting to relive those "grounding" moments.&nbsp;&nbsp;   One day, though, it happened.&nbsp; The bravest of the four babies, or the clumsiest perhaps, ventured away from home.&nbsp; It landed on my bike as if it meant to, although I knew differently.&nbsp; It looked around some and let out one of those tweets that seemed to take so much effort to blat out.&nbsp; The adults were soon hovering, singing, urging the rookie pilot to move on.&nbsp; Naturally, it did.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, the new flier stuck close to home and would gaze up at its siblings wishing it had made a different choice minutes before its descent.&nbsp; At one point, it flew up to the nest, not really knowing how to latch its tiny talons on to something firm.&nbsp; It managed to softly smack into the beam on which the bird home was glued.&nbsp; It fluttered and fluttered and just couldn't make it in.&nbsp; So, in another graceful, I-meant-to-do-that, fashion, it followed a large J path onto the ground below.&nbsp;   The landing in the grass was not as smooth.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, it was literally a crash landing.&nbsp; I think it scared the baby and the mother (and me) because the bird laid there for a bit with one wing outstretched...no movement whatsoever.&nbsp; Then its head turned and looked toward the place from where he traveled.&nbsp; The mother swallow witnessed this all and quickly landed beside her little one and just sat there.&nbsp; This time, there was no effort to play it off as no big deal.&nbsp; Once the shock of&nbsp;the landing wore off, the bird tucked&nbsp;its wing underneath its body and regrouped.&nbsp; It dared to take flight again.&nbsp;   This time, the bird landed on the chair, which was situated below the nest and in front of my glass door.&nbsp; The landing was shaky, but it did get the job done.&nbsp; The youngster sat, perched on the arm watching its siblings reap the benefits of the latest insect catch.&nbsp; After several moments, the baby left the arm of the chair and flew up to the edge of the nest as if it knew exactly what it was doing.&nbsp; It shoved its way past the other three babes and tucked itself in.&nbsp; It didn't leave again...at least not that day.   New bird lessons:  Sometimes the best landings are a result of a few previous crash landings.  If you get scared, home is usually a good place to go.

						   About two weeks after the completion of the nest, two fuzzy heads poked out of the top, faces only a mother could love (and an awe struck observer).&nbsp; They would open their beaks and deliver a squeak that seemed to take every ounce of energy they had.&nbsp; With my presence still unobtrusive, I quietly watched each parent deliver bug after bug to the youngsters.&nbsp; Much to my surprise, I soon learned that there were actually four little ones living above me.&nbsp; I'm not sure how the two on the bottom of the nest survived, but they seemed to have had it all figured out.&nbsp;   Several days passed and each baby managed to look over the edge of the nest.&nbsp; It was as if they were bobbing in water up to their shoulders.&nbsp; The one who could squeak the loudest and open its mouth the widest was often the recipient of "the catch of the minute."&nbsp; I remember watching a parent dutifully bring the young ones a moth.&nbsp; It was pale white in color...its natural color or a color of shear fright, I'm not sure.&nbsp; The adult bird, perhaps letting its guard down with the monotony of delivering bug after bug, attempted to give its offering to the loud, wide mouthed babe.&nbsp; But in an instant, the moth delightfully escaped its pending doom and plotted its miraculous escape.&nbsp; Unfortunately, or fortunately (depending on who you are rooting for), the other adult bird was in close proximity and recaught the baby's dinner.&nbsp; I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad.   Gradually, over the course of at least a week, the fuzzy headed noise makers began to grow feathers.&nbsp; One day they were dark grey cotton balls, and the next they were miniature versions of their parents.&nbsp; They learned to groom themselves, spread their wings, comb their feathers, and scratch their heads.&nbsp; Occasionally an unwelcome third adult barn swallow would swoop by to check out the homestead.&nbsp; It would soon be forcefully convinced to conduct its fly-bys elsewhere.&nbsp;   I also was fortunate to see another intimate detail of this family's life.&nbsp; On occasion, a baby swallow would fidget its way around the nest so that its tail end was hanging over the nest.&nbsp; One of the adults would bring and deliver food.&nbsp; Then the baby bird, tail end out, would produce a fecal sack (yep...The remnants of yesterday's bugs).&nbsp; The adult would grab the fecal sack and fly away with it, dropping it away from the nest.&nbsp; Apparently that was to deter predators from the nest.&nbsp; Judging by the white and black pile of "bird surprises" under the nest, this process was not always successfully completed.   In my new home, I have found great comfort in being a silent observer of the routines of these six swallows.&nbsp; The people within ear shot must think I'm crazy, as I often talk to the birds.&nbsp; They turn and tilt their head, similar to the way my golden retriever does when I talk to him.&nbsp; Sometimes I even get a tweet or two from them.&nbsp; I'm not sure if they are cursing me out or singing my praises or if they are even directing their tunes at me.&nbsp; I like to think that we are exchanging pleasantries.   As the birds went from fuzz to feathers, I learned more lessons.   Don't be afraid to spread your wings, even if it is in the comfort of your own home.   Sometimes the one with the loudest mouth is the one who&nbsp;gets fed first.   It's okay if you bring in&nbsp;"good" and leave with "bad," especially if it involves taking care of loved ones.

						   Interestingly enough, as I was establishing my existance in&nbsp;my&nbsp;new&nbsp;apartment, a pair of barn swallows were creating their&nbsp;living space&nbsp;as well.&nbsp; I felt as though I was secretly watching nature through a hidden hole; my presence didn't seem to phase the birds at all.&nbsp; Each one worked equally in carrying mud and grass to the growing nest.&nbsp; I'm not sure where they found this glue like mud, but the bird home soon became&nbsp;securely attached to the underside of the second floor deck.&nbsp; Amidst the sticky mud, the swallows would weave the grass into desired positions.&nbsp; I distinctly remember one morning&nbsp;when a swallow was having difficulty maintaining a firm grasp on a blade of dead grass.&nbsp; Patiently, it reclamped its beak on the material and eventually worked it in the necessary fashion.&nbsp; If I had been that bird, I would have thrown the grass to the ground in disgust, quickly following the tantrum with a cigarette.  In the end of the construction process, this shelter for swallow eggs stuck to the inside edge of the deck above me, its top just an inch from the floor of the deck.&nbsp; The space hardly seemed large enough to accomodate safe entries and exits.&nbsp; Yet, the pair came and went with ease.&nbsp; I learned something from this observation...  One person's floor is another person's ceiling.  Being subtle and somewhat hidden can protect you in your private time.&nbsp; And don't leave yourself too open to those who are lucky enough to have found you.

						   Here I am...the essense of me reduced to organized compilations of letters and symbols.&nbsp;&nbsp; I must admit that the thought of strangers, and even friends, reading my blog leaves me feeling a bit cautious.&nbsp; Like&nbsp;all works of art, the lines and images are always left for interpretation.&nbsp; For each pair of&nbsp;investigating eyes comes as many, if not more, theoretical "understandings" of the spirit that drives the artist.&nbsp; Perhaps, with luck, I, too,&nbsp;will begin to learn who I am; I will begin to trust myself; and I will begin to see me as the same person I dream to be.&nbsp; With that said, welcome&nbsp;to the perceptions of&nbsp;my journey through the Iowan fields of opportunity.

						   I woke up this morning to find that the barn swallow nest that had been glued to the underside of the deck above me had fallen. My initial thought when I saw the clump was that a dog had been digging nearby and left a nice pile of evidence behind. Upon closer inspection, I realized that the nest had endured its last day.  I went outside to examine the site more closely. It was really quite interesting. The grass of the nest was actually woven, almost like cloth, amongst the mud. This mud that glued the nest together for several months was obviously brought in bit by bit. I could see hundreds of small cylinder clumps of dirt. What a laborious task this must have been for the tiny birds. It made me sad to think that the structure was officially finished with its duties.  I spoke with my dad about the findings, as I had throughout the swallow observations. I've learned a lot about these birds from him in the past, and I learned something new tonight. He said that it was important for the nest to collapse. If it had stayed strong, parasitic creatures could have habitated in it, waiting for the parent birds next summer. Now, with a clean slate, or beam as the case may be, the swallows will be able to create a new, sturdy, safe place to raise their young. He also sounded positive that the birds will return during the next mating season. I look forward to that.  In the meantime, I think it's a shame that the process of rebuilding for the future requires a collapse of the past.

						   It was a cool, rainy day in Iowa today, practically inviting me to do nothing. So I lit some candles, snuggled with a fleece blanket and took in the latest Olympic events. Things were as expected; the top swimmers finished first, the dog napped in front of the screen door, the cats slept in their favorite apartment nooks. Just a regular day.  Then I caught a glimpse of a toad hopping by the cement slab that floors my patio. Odd, I thought, that a toad would be meandering about on such a wet and dreary day. He hopped with vigor, slinging his chubby body forward. I wondered what his plan was. Why was he so intent on getting closer to my bicycle?  After several thrusts forward, he aimed himself toward the rear tire. I thought he might decide to jump over the tire and through the spokes. After all, I did just see him navigate the legs of the lawn chair with ease. Then, the strangest thing happened; the toad walked. He hoisted his body up and waddled away. He reminded me of a turtle. His round torso rocked back and forth as his short, stubby, bow legs worked. Then he stopped. I watched for a while longer, but he had gone as far as he wanted. Apparently the task of jumping the tire was a bit too daunting.  I guess that some risks are worth taking, and some are better left for another day.

						   One of the bike paths behind my apartment winds its way south. On one side, soy bean fields grow. The other side is bordered by overgrown greenery. There appears to be a mixture of tall grass, wild flowers, various weeds, and sporadically planted young trees. In the evening, however, this field area takes on a different personality. Distance croaky sounds drift toward all those close by. Sometimes these sounds belong to ducks; I have seen V shaped flocks traveling above. Sometimes these sounds belong to Great Blue Herons; I have seen these in flight as well. And sometimes, these sounds are the mating calls of frogs. (I have yet to see the frogs fly by.)  It, at first, seemed impossible to see water fowl in the air. After all, the bike path is land locked, or so I thought. I have noticed that toward the middle of the fields are hints of cat tails, the plant, not the animal. The brown cylinder shaped tops poke above grass. The long, narrow, green leaves sway with the wind. The actual water is out of sight, but clues to its existence are evident. I've been tempted to walk through the field to find the hidden niche, but I fear that swampy land will suck me in and keep me prisoner. So, for now, when walking by, I stop and listen to the birds. I watch the cat tails in the wind, and I wait for more information about this secret place to come to me.  You see, sometimes, I know, it is better to wait for answers than to go in search of them.

						   I have found it rather difficult to obsessively observe life outside, now that the swallows are gone. It's not rooted in sadness; instead, I am feeling a lazy kind of loss. The swallows were easy interest targets. They were always there, outside the door, carrying on with the daily rituals. I haven't noticed any other creatures setting up shop outside my door. So I am forced to look elsewhere. Unfortunately, that type of observation takes effort, an effort that I can't seem to find.  However, I have been looking around. What else is a girl to do when her dog is sniffing, exploring, and peeing on every other bush. Like I said before, I am collecting nature details like a kid collects Easter eggs. I haven't paid close attention to each detail, but I still scoop it up and tuck it away for further reflection. Today, I thought I would introduce you to my vast knowledge of trees.  Behind my apartment building, a bike path winds its way through soybean and corn fields. It's paved and is surrounded by cut field grass. Along one particular section, a line of trees have been planted. I'm not able to identify these trees by their scientific name. Instead, there is the tree with the yellow flowers below, the tree with the ribbon tied to a limb, the last tree, the first tree, the tree by the bench...you get the idea. There is also the dead tree.  The dead tree stands about six feet high. It is feeble and brittle, yet it still holds onto its leaves. I'm not sure what its affliction is. An animal, or person perhaps, has been digging at its mulch base. Oddly enough, birds always scratch and poke around for food beneath it. Perhaps they are paying their respects, as I do each time I pass by. My dog, KJ, has "pee"ed on the tree, claiming it for his own. He doesn't seem to mind that the tree is brown. He probably picked it out because it is so different from the others.  I find it interesting that unless you remember to look for the dead tree, you could easily pass by it, not noticing it at all. I guess there are other things in the area that divert attention. Sad, in a way, to be on the edge of life and death and to have an existence so subtle that people need to use effort to take notice. I wonder how long it will endure its fate.  I do know one thing; while the dead tree still stands, KJ and I will take in its fragile worthiness every day. Regardless, everything (or everyone) is worthy of appreciation.

						   It's probably obvious to even the least interested nature watchers that there are multiple shades of green. After weeks of sitting outside, I have come to appreciate the various colors of yellow. I suppose it is because the dullest of yellows appear brilliant against the backdrop of green.  A day or two after the barn swallows left, my new neighbor planted a bird feeder on the edge of the mini-ravine that outlines the property behind the apartment complexes. The feeder is a fairly lengthy, narrow cylinder capped with a yellow top. At first, it appeared to be a bit too flashy for its surroundings, until the goldfinches found it. Now, it dulls in comparison to the tiny creatures eating the contents within. All of the shades of yellow dull in comparison to the finches' feathers. The petals of the brown-eyed susans take on a more brownish hue. The warning sign on the bike path indicating a left hand turn even seems brown. Yellow butterflies are more pale than I remember them.  Yes, the brilliance of the goldfinch drains all other colors.  The goldfinch, Iowa's state bird, is a fascinating creature. I watched two in flight this afternoon. They flapped their wings rapidly twice or three times, and then they glided for a bit. If they left a mark in the sky like jets often do, it would be in a casual, hilly path. The math side of me is reminded of a stretched sin curve. The artist part of me is reminded of a child drawing mountains on the horizon of a picture. Unfortunately, the goldfinches are very busy creatures and don't feel the need to stick around for very long. They do, however, remind me that you don't need to flap your wings continuously to get where you want to go.

						   I have found myself watching the ground below pass by as I walk with my dog, KJ. It amazes me that so much activity occurs in the grass, seemingly unharmed by all those who tread over this niche. I would like to say that I pay close attention to each hop, buzz, and fly-by, but I don't. Instead, I casually watch, scooping up each detail like a kid collecting Easter eggs. I find it interesting that my dog can prance through a flowered patch of clover that is alive with bee business and not get stung. Me? I could be sitting in a chair, minding my own "beesiness" and feel the mighty punch of a stinger.  I have also noticed that there seem to be quite a variety of grass hopping creatures. Some are black, and some are green. Most seem to have some type of goal for the day in mind, and they go about their plan as if I wasn't around. However, on occasion, I have noticed this one particular type of jumping creature. It is fairly dark in color, and I usually spot it on the pavement of the walking trail. I know it senses my presence because I can see it preparing to jump. It squats down a bit and wiggles slightly. Perhaps it is counting to three before it commits to the jumping decision. Then, as I get closer, it jumps. I don't think it knows where it is going, and I don't think it knows where it is when it lands. Sometimes it jumps forward, sometimes to the left, and sometimes to the right. Always, its bouncy landing seems to shock it.  An odd little creature, it is, leaping with such reckless abandonment.  Maybe, someday, I will work up the courage to jump haphazardly and start my journey from where I land.
