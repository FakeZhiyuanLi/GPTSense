      Okay.&nbsp; So a first-time blog is not such a big deal, but this is my first one.&nbsp; For me, this summer was spent thinking, dreaming, planning, relaxing, playing, travelling (with which I'm not yet finished), reminiscing, and reading.&nbsp; I hope there's more, too.   I hope to use blogs with my advisory this year if they're willing.&nbsp; I think it would be a splendid way of keeping track of journals, and I may actually journal this way, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The only time I ever journaled truly in my life was during my trip to Scotland in 1991.&nbsp; I read that journal every once in a while an find out that though I think I remember everything I did (and certainly everything I wrote), that I forgot many things and am pleasantly reminded.&nbsp; Reminded of not only what I did, but also how I did it.&nbsp; My personality shines through.&nbsp; It helps to keep me in those emotional and spiritual spaces that I loved and keep me out of those places that weren't so good for me.   For example, I was reading recently some prose I wrote in the Scottish&nbsp;journal, and I was struck with quite a bit of nostalgia.&nbsp; Here's the poem:    Bedtime 6 Jan 1992     Life, in particular friendship, is like making a friendship bracelet:     Choosing the colors carefully, you begin to strategically tie the knots of a pattern that is most pleasing; and, although you may imagine quite clearly how that pattern will look, it never quite specifically fits the perfection with which your imagination intangibly created it at the start.&nbsp; Many times, the stitches are loose or awkward, but you can say to yourself, “Hey, it adds character!” and continue tying a growing image of a dream continually becoming reality.&nbsp; Occasionally, in a hurried attempt to view a finished pattern, mistakes detrimental to the creation and beauty of the bracelet are made, and knots must be untied to be tied and tried again.&nbsp; With time and patience, this can be done successfully. &nbsp;Eventually, a series of patterns are connected end to end becoming eternal.&nbsp; As the bracelet is worn, time and weather may strip it of some of its original, bright color, but those tight, scrutinously-hand-knitted knots remain always close, always strong.   &nbsp;

      Posting from good ole Camp Kern today.  I was supposed to lead a river hike, but got zero takers.  I mean absolutely no one!  Oh well.  So I have time to write.  Today I led an activity called "Spider Web."  Participants were challenged to get the whole team through a large rope spider web without knocking out the spider (looked very much like a stick).  The first group was interesting, and they did just what people usually do.  They started doing their own thing.  Then when that didn't work, a few leaders stepped up and shared their ideas for how to make it work.  They found it particularly frustrating when I silenced the adults (the adults that is).  They came one person away from completing the task twice.  The second group came flying in with ideas and directions and everyone was his or her own leader.  It was a mess at first.  So I silenced all but three people that the group could pick to speak.  It was amazing the difference.  They were nearly successful twice.  The third group was extremely focused from the get go with a lot of creative ideas and support.  Their teamwork paid off, and they completed the element in time to try another - they were successful in that, too.  Processing was fun as we tied all of the experiences back to school.  They all "got" it, and were enlightened.  Tonight I'm looking forward to the campfire.  Our skits should be a hoot!  CD

      Tonight I met an old friend for dinner E-mailed me out of the blue like a bird pooping on my head The kind of thing that makes you interested, but nervous It was one of those newfangled invites:  we never talked, just e-mail  He said beer or dinner with families I said dinner with families He said where? I said you choose the time and place He said my 6:30, my place, August 12 I said I'm a vegetarian He said we're trying to do that, too I didn't say anything He said individual pizzas I said you know what kids like He said they're 2 and 4  So we show up, and I think it's kinda risky What if we don't get along after all these years I knew him at Camp Kern We were all crazy back then But now we have kids and houses to pay for  Our kids all hit it off great The guys talked about guy stuff The ladies talked about lady stuff I'm glad because we talked about computers and video They talked about babies and stay-at-home-momism He's a teacher So we shared funny stories, too  And get this . . . He's trying to take the shell of an old piano And put an electric piano inside of it He got the old piano on ebay That's a hefty download even with DSL  Dinner was yummy The brownies were calling my name from beneath the saran wrapping All dinner long  So it was time to go Our girls needed to get up early I felt awkward because we were just getting rolling with some after dinner conversation But that's okay It's our place after Labor Day He wants to learn more about Premiere (That's a video editing suite for some of you that don't know)  Then it was off to church to play music It was fun Dave, the director, drove me home We talked in the driveway for fifteen minutes About new friends  CD

      Tonight I watched a foreign film (Chinese) called  Together.   It was a fantastic story about a young boy who was a violin prodigy and his father's determination to find success for him.  First of all, the photography was amazing.  Full of artistic prowess and devoid of color except for the people who affect change in the young boy's life.  They all wear   red   (or ride in a   red   car).  The setting is intriguing:  everywhere from simple Chinese country life to big, bustling Beijing.  I found it enlightening to grab some cultural understanding from the living conditions of the modest citizen and the very rich.  Heating the home, for example, was efficiently delivered in round coal packets.  The father's straightforward, honest, and humble demeanor challenges viewers to reflect on their own generosity.  As the story is knitted together, we begin to see just how much of a sacrifice Dad makes in his life to bring his son success.  When all is truly revealed at the triumphant end, my wife and I were left in tears - both for the musical passion and the love a father can show his son.  Challenge yourself to watch this film.   It is a good lesson in filmmaking, storytelling, family, culture, commitment, and, again, sacrifice.  CD

      Here I am after a hiatus of several days.  I was trying to set a good example and blog every day.  Then it happened . . . I was not able to log in successfully.  It was frustrating because I wanted to write (and actually had some great things to write about!), but I couldn't.  When I blogged in, I kept getting an error message that I entered the wrong password.  Well I use the same username and password for almost EVERYTHING.  That way I don't forget it.  Apparently I did.  So I did what we always do when we forget our online passwords -- I clicked the " Forgot your password?"  link and was notified that I was being sent an e-mail that would help me out.  Got the e-mail, but this blog site doesn't send me my password and username.  It sends me a link that SAYS it's going to link me to a page that will allow me to change my password.  Well golly if it didn't send me back to the page into which I had just tried unsuccessfully to enter my stuff into which I unsuccessfully entered my stuff again.   And again.  And, after clicking " Forgot your password?"  and getting another e-mail link, again.  So I then proceeded to do what we all naturally do when we can't be helped virtually:  I contacted customer support.  Well I got a page that allowed me to enter my complaint and e-mail into a form.  When I got a response, the tech (or probably computer-generated) response was to get a different browser -- Mozilla.  Ha!  What a marketing campaign!  Offer people something free, disable it, then ask them to get your preferred browser to fix the problem.  So, as you can see, I was getting pretty paranoid.  So, obviously, I did what anyone does when feeling frustrated, annoyed, and backed up against a wall:  I went on a camping trip.  Okay, so I was planning to go camping anyhow, but it was good timing and did not allow me to do anything online for 3 days (which my wife says is good for me).   When I returned today, I tried again to no avail.  I was on the verge of just starting over with my blog.  So I thought I'd give it one last attempt.  I tried all kinds of versions of usernames and passwords until I got it:  ALL LOWER CASE (I mean, all lower case).  My username, which I ALWAYS use a combination of UPPER and lower case to type, is in all lower case in this case.  So.  Problem solved.  Good bloggable content lost.  Peace restored.  Wow!  If you really read all the way to the bottom of this blog entry, you deserve to learn more.  This is a history of where the terms "uppercase" and "lowercase" come from:  (source:  wordIQ.com) "The terms "upper case" and "lower case" derive from Gutenberg's use of two separate drawers, or cases, to store capital letters and small letters. The former were stored in his upper case; the latter, in his lower case. Letters were carved backward, so that, when printed as mirror images, they would appear correctly on the page. This is the origin of the expression, "Mind your p's and q's," as the letter "q" would resemble a backward "p" and vice versa. "  And here is a link to an image of an upper and lower case printing press set:  urlLink http://wally.rit.edu/cary/CP_publications/CP_APHAPoster.html   Enjoy, and mind your p's and q's.

        but you can't get a dolla outta me     no cadillac no perm you can't see     that I love doing PLPs    That's right.  Yesterday I hit the trail for some PLP meetings.  My clients for the day were Mfghan, TasJanea, and Jerannetta.  I woke up early and hit the computer for some last-minute ideas and printouts to take with me.  My six year old stood at my door and surmised that she'd have to serve me breakfast, lunch, and dinner at my computer.  She thinks I'm always on it.  Well, here I am again.    Mfghan  I hit Miff's favorite store, K-Mart, for some sticky pads and pencils on the way out.  Driving through Old North Dayton, I wiggled my way back and forth across Troy St. to find Deeds Ave.  Being clever, I'd prepared some MapQuest maps of my destinations and arrived at the address I had for Mfghan by wiggling through an alleyway.  After having knocked a few times, I decided to call.  "Good morning, Mary.  I'm standing on your porch right now!"  "You're not standing on MY porch," she reported.   I was directed down the street to the correct address as I was greeted by the resident of the original house.  A little explaining and I rolled out.  Mfghan shared a lot of her interests:  clowning, music, unicycling, hairdoing, drama, magic, balloons, photography.  After an intense two-hour session, we arrived a project idea:  a photojournal studying urban sprawl and poverty   Very cool, and it's up my alley (appropriate since I had to travel up Mfghan's alley to find her house).  Then I did a PEP (personalized errand plan) and took care of lunch, carpet shopping, and camera shopping before heading to TasJanea's.   TasJanea  TasJanea's family was great.  They all hung out in the living room as Tasj, her mother, and I got cozy on the couch to talk school.  As we talked about her interests, her family interjected and gave us some great ideas.  Kiki (TasJanea's nickname) was quick to understand  how project-based learning and gateways work.  Impressive.  And I told her so.  And I'm telling her so again if she's reading this.  Biggest strength that was communicated was math.  So we tried to find something interested in the field of mathematics.  Her brother suggested that she should build something.  So born was the idea that we stuck with:  Construct a 3-D model of the Wright-Dunbar neighborhood   This is excellent, because as we document the growth of that neighborhood, her model can grow and change.  We're looking at this being a group effort.  So I hope we can find others that are interested.   Jerannetta  Before hitting Jerannetta's, I had dinner at The Trolley Stop with Michelle.  She had a wrap, and I had a strange pesto bread combo that cleverly disguised the bird poop falling from the branches overhead in the courtyard.  Gathering some bird doo for my do, I was lookin' good and smellin' like garlic for our next meeting.  Michelle came along.  Jerannetta's and her mother seemed excited about her opportunities at DECA.  Her father was admittedly not on board yet.  He was concerned about the abstract nature of project-based learning.  I understand, because it's a scary proposition when you take away the carefully-delivered approach of direct instruction.  Nonetheless, after some thinking, we came up with a plan:  A video documentary about why the DECA teachers chose this school.     It will be a good start.  We'll have to find some other content for her to study while she's working through this documentary.  She's interested in the grant writing and fundraising aspects of the film project, and I'm anxious to start building a student team for that purpose.  That was the day.   I was too tired to type it all last night.  Be good.  CD

        im kinda confused right now. mr.frank is making me start a blog and so far its been really hard just trying to get all the settings right. i dont like this whole idea of blogging and i dont want people reading it either. so if your reading it now just close your eyes and forget all about it. my grandma keeps getting on to me because i wont use capital letters or those little slashy marks that i dont even know what the name is. and im not good with stating new paragraphs. so this is what your gonna be in for if you chose to read my bloggy thingy. they should have gave me more template choices. this one is kinda ugly. well anyways i will tell you about my day. here we go:
