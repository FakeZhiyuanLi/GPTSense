						    Try that:  For at least three days, or better yet for a week, keep close track of how you spend your minutres in:   important and unimportant phone calls,   studying papers,   restudying papers you've already read,   socializing,  planning,  daydreaming,  being interrupted  making significant headway.   Then, figure out where you're wasting your time in relation to your priorities.

						     Scheduling less important work before more important work.  Starting a job before thinking it through.  Leaving jobs before they are completed.  Doing things that can be delegated to another person.  Doing things that can be delegated to modern equipment.  Doing things that actually aren't a part of your real job.  Keeping too many, too complicated, or overlapping records.  Handling too wide a variety of duties.  Failing to build barriers against interruptions.  Allowing conferences and discussions to wander.  Conducting unnecessary meetings, visits, and/or phone calls.  Chasing trivial data after the main facts are in.  Socializing at great length between tasks.

						    Two years ago I've started one of the most complex and life changing enterprises of my life: an MBA. Nothing since then left the same: my innerside, my life, my family, my relationships, my job, my perceptions and expectations about myself, loved ones, friends and strangers alike.The very day, the two WTC towers were smashed to the ground. I saw my American colleagues in shock (and not only the Americans ones). I was also but because it was about a carnage not because of all economical repercussions that were to roll over the whole world. It is crazy but I could not see that time any economical or financial implication of that event. I was listening amased forecasts made by professionals or not so professionals, of people who just wanted to have an opinion about it. An alarm bell rang deep inside me! I was not able  at all  to discuss the subject as a business person.  Will I ever be a business person? Will I ever be able to add my own contribution to any organization in a distinctive way? Will I ever be able to manage something and induce positive change? Will I ever be able to taylor the way and lead people along it?  PANIC!!!!  No, I should just breath and calm down!  I definitely have the will, and it is said where is a will there is a way. This log is more than a journal. I want it my tool for building self confidence. There is my sixth sense telling me I can. I can. I love my sixth sense. Seldom get it wrong! I should educate it more!  Back today: today is the Administration Counsel at Group level. The last audit was terrifying for the owner. The bases for a new group structure are to be set. I wonder which will be the criterion for defining the new divisions? Hope this 11th of September to shake the chaos in my company and bring order. I am a dreamer, isn't it?

						     When thinking on how people perform into their jobs, I came across to two basic categories of people: winners and whiners. After more than ten years spent into the work market landscape, my conclusion is that a simple detail separates people in the mentioned categories: our perspective to a very simple question:

						    Do you ever feel the need to discuss professional issues and not to have a reliable person to talk to inside your company? Well, I do. Perhaps this is one of the reasons I have started to post here.      Here it is a little clue on how you can build your knowledge-base network:  http://www.linkedin.com  I tried to search for Romanian profiles. There are only 12. Although I do am convinced there are much more people whose perspective would be interesting. Success with your network!        Any ideas of how to put your network at work?

						   Hello everyone!   First announcement : I was thrilled to see today that I do have my first subscriber. Congratulations, whoever you are! You will not be dissapointed. So... after all... people are interested in such topics!   Second announcement : I just changed the title of my page. I started writing here this  Journey to Selfconfidence  under the sign of insecurity . Today I changed my mind. The new title is  To Whom It May Concern . Is not that I reached a confortable level of selfconfidence. But I just realized that I have first to accept myself with all my downsides to build selfconfidence on it.  So...here we are dear Reader - To Whom It May Concern might be right for you! Enjoy!

						    Why I ask? Just came from one of my colleague? s office. In the middle of a discussion he wanted to sustain his point and looked for a certain email he got on the subject. His Outlook Inbox was an interminable long list of emails? and in the end he was not able to find anything. Nor to use any advanced Search option. In the middle of the debate, I was for a moment intrigued: he is a Project Manager; in principle, this is what he is supposed to do ? to manage information and internal and external communication channels (well?besides budget, quality and delivery term). That inbox told me something bad about his organizational skills.      And here I am, asking you: how do you organize your mail-box, or your files in your computer? Wait your inputs. Thanks.

						   I write this for the ones who intend to get a sponsorship for an MBA from their current employer. Lots of people found my Yahoo profile interesting because of this MBA, and asked me how on the Earth I managed to pay for it. It is a reasonable question that I put myself when I was playing with the idea of following such study programme. Still, I suggest that getting money for it is just a milestone, and one should be very much aware of it?s further implications.  Once you graduate an MBA, you want to prove how much you are worthy. You have energy, you have your passed work experience and you look with pride at it, you have now concepts and all these management methodology on your side, and you are just eager and willing to perform.  Your connections with the company who sponsored your management training goes beyond the agreement you signed that you will provide services for the next 5 years. After all, you were just a Romanian provincial who had a dream but who would have never been able to afford paying yourself that MBA or engaging a loan for it. It was indeed your idea, will, hard work and a bit of vision to aim for. You just passed all program admission interviews, while they paid the money. Thus, 5 years by your company seemed in Romanian context a fair toll. After all, there were more than 7 years you dedicated to this company so far, you were quite happy with it in your half obscure middle management position, and saw no reason why not stay for the next 5 years. Future seamed so bright!  You came back into the company and started, step-by-step, experiencing the tights.   First  , the context is totally changed. There is a totally new management team. Relatively young, around 45 - a dangerous age: if not here, nowhere, because this might be the last train, and anyway we are the best this place can born. There is no need or room for you to come and fill in. It is obvious and the new managers remind you every day.   Second , everybody asks you why you should have graduated with distinction. The answer, as honest as it is, leaves your peers, and bosses alike, astonished: Because this is the way you know to do things. It is so obvious? I mean, your whole record stands for it. This answer puts managers en garde: afraid to talk for not being caught with the mistake (yard?s words), however feeling like is their duty to say something memorable every time you meet them, just to prove they are also capable of this management stuff.   Third , your diploma is not written down in your work card. You receive an official explanation from the HR person that the Romanian Ministry of Education does not recognize the MBA program that your company accepted to pay for it. What difference does it make that is recognized by the Association of MBAs and at that time was ranking a honorable place in Europe being in top 100 worldwide. But you anyway finds this out several month later when you are not taken into consideration for a major managerial position within your company, just because your work card do not contain this piece of info although you presented all documents.   Fourth : You are aware about the lack of proper communication inside your company. You are aware about a higher organizational context of the Mother company, and witness every day the misleading communication available in the company. You want to apply and check with reality as many as possible models and frameworks you know. You see direct application of many of them. You see the need for the position of Internal Advisor by the Management Board. You know your company struggles in putting in place the right processes. You see there is practically no one from the current management team available and able to coordinate integrated improvement actions and volunteer yourself.  After a while, after many discussions and without an official nomination you are just left to do it. Main arguments of the Managing Director against were (the priority pertains to the respective manager and, of course, I will not give any counter facts, because, as in item 1, there is none whatsoever): 1 - I am a woman; 2 - I put all the company facts in theoretical models which proves to be a problem for the average understanding ability of managers within company. 3 - Shipbuilding is something that can be done even without modern management concepts.  Then, there is a pretty good period when you engage discussions with the current directors to get their trust and commitment, after a while dig out current organizational problems with their support, identify root causes and you have the satisfaction of managers agreeing and assuming them, agree an improvement action plan on each functional area and do take care for these actions to be integrated, build a unified improvement plan and make follow up of it every couple of weeks. Still, your hands are tight: you are not in a decision position, your presence is refused at the coordinating meetings of the directors where such plan should be an important issue in their discussion, you are refused putting in place your own coordinating meetings (managers are very busy, this is a fact very well known), you are refused all the attempts in building a two way communication channel with the Managing Director, who seams not having any time for you whenever you want to involve him to visibly support the whole process.   Five : You witness ad-hoc managerial decisions taken without any other reason than moving or bringing certain persons into certain positions. And sometimes you just remain stunned because there is no gain in the move unless the back agenda of the involved people. Furthermore, your analysis shows the decision would be either useless or would have a different effect than expected, just because the root cause have not been tackled.   Six : You have your own pressures: positions your colleagues got in Western Europe (those who got them!), your CV filling with lots of analysis projects plus recommendations and implementation plans but actually no figures you can put to quantify your value added to organization.   But, what would be getting the black pearl from the seabed without having the whole diving experience, right?   Yes, I did felt every day of 2003 with all my sharpened senses. It came with hard work and less recognition. Still, how I felt growing?I think there is only one answer to this question: I realized my only chance inside this company is to market myself locally as a knowledge brand. Therefore, I transformed talks into discussions, presentations or work meetings. Pinging & Networking! Going direct on production site and taking notice, making observations and getting to know people directly. There are so many of them with good intentions, will and positive attitude wanting to help you. I definitely know every word of what I am talking about now. If at the beginning was just a theoretical approach and a well-educated hunch, now is definitely more. My word weighs a lot in front of my peers / my managers. For some of them, it is still hard to admit. But I know it. You can see it in their eyes. And in my eyes also.   My motivation over the year:  the deep conviction that if I cannot win my power inside this company, I will not be able to win in any other! Rules at that level are more all less the same, no matter the company.   I do look forward to this year!

						    Today I found this story on the net. I loved it and wanted to share.      Your vision is the promise of what you shall one day be; your ideal is the prophecy of what you shall at last unveil."       As A Man Thinketh in the original Chicken Soup for the Soul, Jack Canfield tells the story of Monty, who was the son of an itinerant horse trainer of little means. During his senior year he was assigned a writing project to describe what he wanted to be when he grew up. His seven-page essay minutely detailed the 200-acre ranch he wanted to own. It included a diagram of the ranch and a detailed floor plan of his 4,000 square foot home.       Despite the passion and effort Monty put into his paper, he received it back with a large "F" written on it and a note to see the teacher after class. The teacher told Monty that the reason he had given him that grade was because his paper was unrealistic. He went on to cite all of the reasons why, and told Monty that if he would rewrite the paper with a more realistic goal, he would reconsider the grade.       After considering it for a week, the young man turned in the same paper with no changes, along with the remark, "You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream."       The conclusion of the true story has the teacher bringing 30 students for a summer campout at the 200-acre ranch of the now grown (and successful) Monty who lives in his 4,000 square foot dream home.       The principle is simple:     create a dream that is so big that it will keep you excited,     define the dream in minute detail,     live in the dream so that it becomes real to you on the inside, and then...    hold on to it so tightly that no one can take it away from you.     James Allen goes on to offer this great wisdom:   "  Cherish your visions; cherish your ideals...For out of them will grow all delightful conditions, all heavenly environment; of these, if you but remain true to them, your world will at last be built  ."   But Monty, perhaps, offered the greatest wisdom:  "  You can keep the F and I'll keep my dream  ."    And that's worth thinking about!

						    This is not an original story... on turns, we all have been one of these monkeys. Why? Because we just simply let go, or give up in front of other people - not the smartest, not the most organized ones, not the most energetic ones or even not the most charismatic ones - but usually the most bully ones !?   *******************************    Subject: Demonstration Of Pavlov's Theory of Bureaucracy       Start with a cage containing five monkeys. In the cage, hang a banana on a string and put stairs under it. Before long, a monkey will go to the stairs and start to climb towards the banana.     As soon as he touches the stairs, spray all of the monkeys with cold water. After a while, another monkey will make an attempt with the same response -- all of the monkeys are sprayed with cold water. Keep this up for several days.  Turn off the cold water. If, later, another monkey tries to climb the stairs, the other monkeys will try to prevent it even though no water sprays them.     Now, remove one monkey from the cage and replace it with a new one. The new monkey sees the banana and wants to climb the stairs. To his horror, all of the other monkeys attack him. After another attempt and attack, he knows that if he tries to climb the stairs, he will be assaulted.     Next, remove another of the original five monkeys and replace it with a new one. The newcomer goes to the stairs and is attacked. The previous newcomer takes part in the punishment with enthusiasm.     Replace the third original monkey with a new one. The new one makes it to the stairs and is attacked as well. Two of the four monkeys that beat him have no idea why they were not permitted to climb the stairs, or why they are participating in the beating of the newest monkey. After replacing the fourth and fifth original monkeys, all the monkeys which have been sprayed with cold water have been replaced. Nevertheless, no monkey ever again approaches the stairs.  Why not?  Because that's the way it's always been done around here .   ********************************   Well...is it so? If your answer is YES than probably you have been doomed to be?just a?monkey. If your answer is NO, than read    Donald Trump's 7 rules for success     see where you stand and how are you different than others. Perhaps not all of you have time to click the link, and anyway I am in the mood of reviewing them.  So...here there are 7 rules for success:     You have to be born with enough brainpower.    Once you have that, you have to love what you're doing. I've never seen anyone succeed who didn't love what they were doing.    You cannot stop. If there is a concrete wall in front of you, you have to go through it. You can never, ever give up or even think in terms of giving up.      Confidence is a very important thing. But confidence isn't something you just develop by saying "I'm going to do this or that." You really have to believe it.      I love pitting people against each other. My whole life is based on that. It brings out the best in people and the worst in people. If the worst comes out, you don't want them working for you.    You have to remain cool under fire and let criticism roll off you. Good leaders handle conflict easily and bad ones are eaten up by it.     You must work well with others and be loyal to your team. Disloyalty is the worst of all traits. I seldom use the words "You're fired!" in business, unless somebody is really scum and stole from me.       Enjoy!

						   This comes from an experience with my last (and almost only …so far) employer. Acting as a consultant in my former company meant for me not only lending to and negotiating with the current middle and top management team the best appropriate framework of analysis and decision making, but also informing them about role and involvement they should have in the restructuring of processes in progress within the company.  The lower the hierarchy level, the higher the degree of incertitude about the role they perceived they actually should have towards effectiveness – i.e. doing the right things. Even in terms of efficiency - i.e. doing things right – many of them thought it is the privilege of their bosses. And all these in accompany that spent good money to get ISO 9001:2000 accreditation.  Being in charge with crafting job descriptions for the newly born project organization inside the company for the relevant positions in project management and in functional management alike, I had an interesting challenge in applying the manager’s “to do” list in each job environment. I searched that time internet for a unifying “vision” over every manager’s role, irrespective of the process s/he is in charge with or the industry.  My search was rewarded indeed. Below there is a “to do” list of any manager who is committed to systemic improvements and increase of overall effectiveness and efficiency. Aside its gospel look, I suggest every manager is worthy to make a credo out of it.   I WILL BE A JONAH   I will be a Jonah. I have personal needs. I have personal goals. I will get to know myself so that I can help others. I will learn to manage my time wisely. I will balance my political, social, economic, family, and spiritual life. I will ask questions.  I will be self-directed. I will be an ethical role model. I will learn to think both inductively and deductively. I will set priorities.  I will discipline myself. I will teach others. I will not be a “Herbie”.  I will be a Jonah. I know the goal.  I will be a Jonah. My organization has needs. My organization has goals. I will help my organization make good decisions. I will listen, educate, motivate, communicate and evaluate. I will focus on growth and stress quality.  I will be a leader. I will establish a creative environment. I will take risks, expect rejection, accept responsibility. I will achieve results, and provide rewards.  I will be a manager. I will plan, organize, direct and control. I will decentralize decision-making and implement decisions successfully. I will tie compensation to performance and align responsibility and authority.  I will teach time management. I will focus on throughput. I will use teams. I will ask what to change, what to change to, and how to change.  I will be an administrator. I will critically review policies and procedures. I will benchmark and measure. I will establish a working reward system.  I will be a Jonah. I know the goal.  I will be a Jonah. Others have needs. Others have goals. I will build self-confidence in others. I will teach others to rely on their own brain power and experience. I will reward common sense solutions.  I will communicate. I will “walk around” and “get to know” others. I will respond to complains. I will strive to build a bridge of trust.  I will provide stepping-stones and landmarks. I will help others overcome resistance to change. I will reach out to others for answers. I will be accountable.  I will be a Jonah. I know the goal.  I will be a Jonah. I will find “Herbie”. I will exploit, subordinate and elevate. I will be a Jonah. I will shatter the accepted perceptions of organizational reality. I will learn from the wisdom and experience of others.  I will be a Jonah. I will work smarter, not harder. I will not be perfect. Perfection is not necessary.  I will be a Jonah. I know the goal.  For those of you involved in business administration in any way, Goldratt’s book The Goal is a must.  Enjoy and apply!

						   Too often, in the large manufacturing Romanian companies, top management mix up these two individual traits. Triggered by a personal experience while acting as a consultant, I tried to point out the big gap that separates them and demystify what modesty in the workplace is about.   In a manager’s or a consultant’s role, being modest is an important asset. Modesty is about knowing well what you know, what you do not know, what you can improve and what you cannot improve at yourself no matter what. Modesty is about being honest to yourself, your peers, subordinates or hierarchical bosses. Being honest is about being consistent in long time in your attitude, behavior, actions and words.   Consistency should be manifested in all the areas below:   Ø          organizational vision and personal intentions  :       o        Do people perceive you as acting in the shareholder’s / company’s interest?        o        Do people perceive you as working at your back agenda?       o        Do people perceive you as protecting your own turf?        Ø          asserting your own person to the group’s / project’s / organization’s interest  :       o        Do peers / subordinates perceive you commit time and resources to the benefit of the                 group / project  or to the benefit of yourself?       o        Do peers perceive you use objectively and to the group’s best interests your knowledge                 and / or power?  Ø          respect   :       o        Do people perceive you as respectful towards cultural or gender differences?       o        Do people perceive you as respectful towards cultural or gender differences?       o        Do people perceive you as respectful towards their work and their results?  Ø          confidence  :       o        Do people perceive you as a person committed to building trust and openness in your       o        Do people perceive you as a person committed to building trust and openness in your                 relationships?       o        Do people perceive you as a person adding value through the nature of the feedback                 you provide?  Ø          learning process  :               o        Do you do enrich your skills and knowledge with those items you promised you                           will  do?               o        Do you do obtain those results that you committed to obtain?               o        Do you openly share the skills and knowledge to the best interest of the your                         peers?   Being modest does not mean that:  Ø        You are a person without a well formed and valuable opinion;  Ø        You are requested no feedback;  Ø        You do not know how and what to do;  Ø        You are not expected to assert yourself to the interest of the group / organization;  Ø        You should not be given the authority or supported visibility to finish in goods conditions             your project / work assigned.  Ø        It is not normal to have career goals that are worthy to pursue inside the organization             you work for or outside it.  Ø        You cannot and do not have a positive impact over your peers and bosses, just because it             is not written in your job description.  Ø        You should not be proud about your personal and professional achievements.  Modesty breath out of you with every word and gesture you do. Modesty sparks immediately from the crowd. Modesty is visible. Because it has ears, it is emphatic, speaks out from deep knowledge and understanding, values sharing and sets immediate as role-model for the ones around.  Exactly that is why, modesty in an individual has nothing to do with a low profile person. A low profile person is a person who exposes himself / herself as little as possible to the contact with the others. A person who prefers no visibility because either s/he doesn’t know or s/he doesn’t care, or s/he is very insecure on personal knowledge, skills or newly acquired position. A person for whom is much more comfortable to blame than fix.   Than why on the Earth I continue to hear managers asking their subordinates to maintain a low profile?

						   Does school prepares the nowadays children for the real world? This is the central idea of Kiyosaki’s “Rich Dad, Poor Dad” book. Financial Education is what most of the Romanian families lack today. There are some newspapers that talk the language of money, presenting and monitoring for instance the evolution of a portfolio of investments or the benefits of a insurance package, but too often it is quite difficult for a non initiate to understand the language.   Moreover, many advertisements presents credit cards as the hocus-pocus solution of any difficult situation when you run out of money, or bank loan facilities for building a home or for consumer products. Little is said about the other aspect of returning those money and the real amount a person should return afterwards. Having such means is perfectly OK. The main point is that most of the people engage themselves in spending without having the slightest idea about what will come.   Robert Kiyosaki found a very simple way of explaining tough and important things to anyone. I started to read the book together with my son. He is 11, a little bit older than the age when Kiyosaki was exposed to different way of thinking:  -          of the “poor dad”, who was his natural father, a university professor at different highly reputed universities across USA, with Doctoral degree and another Master’s degree, not poor at all, but who chose to work for the state and who died in debts; and  -          of the “rich dad”, who was his best friend’s father, a graduate of not even eight classes, but who chose to work for himself and died letting a fortune behind for family and various charities.   Reading the book I was stroked about the fundamentally different thinking logic. And I could not help myself finding similarities between my parents’ way of thinking (both professors, and PhD and …of course enjoying an average Romanian life, but working their whole life for state) that they involuntary passed it further to me and my sister.   “Poor dad” said:   Money is the devil’s eye. I can’t afford this. The reason why I am not rich is that I have, you, kids! Our house is our main asset. I trust in government and in my company  to take care of my needs (health, salary increase, pension, sickness, vacation, company perks). Because I worked long time for the state, I deserve them all. I am not interested by money. Money doesn’t matter. I spare money whenever I afford. When money are involved, do not take risks. Learn to master the risks associated with money. I will never be rich. I am not rich. I teach you how to create a perfect CV to find a good job. Study hard to become an accountant, a lawyer or a doctor - a trustworthy professional.   “Rich” dad said:   Lack of money is the devil’s eye. What should I do to afford this. The reason why I should be rich is that I have, you, kids! Our house is our biggest liability, because when our own home becomes the biggest investment, that’s trouble for us! I trust in my complete financial independence because it gives me the power of choosing. Money means power. I create investments. I am a rich man and rich men do not do this. I am just broken, but that’s temporary. I teach you how to create a perfect business and financial plans to create jobs. Study hard how to work your money in your favor.  It was interesting to make this parallel. I think my son has the right to know there are two fundamentally different choices of living as good citizens. And I am glad we read this book together.  Our thoughts usually choose for us and shape our lives. They help us either breaking the  rat race  or keeping us continuously captive inside.

						   A small “insignifiant” note in the yesterday’s issue of  Monitorul de Galati:  Two public health units serving the whole population in Galati harbour area, as weel as, the Border Health Control Unit, might be moved and soon hosted by the building of the Galati Software Park. This initiative is currently in project stage and should pass the decision of the Galati County Council to really happen. The note ends up in an optimistic and populist tone: this project would mainly serve to the population of Galati harbour area, older in its majority.  Now, let me be very well understood: people, especially the old ones needs lots of public health attention, no doubt about that. Still, no matter how soft the public health issue in Romania is, that Software Park swallowed a huge amount from its main shareholder – the Sate – to bring in important software players worldwide and gather “more than 100 small companies altogether”, as Mr. Nica, the former MTCI ministry, explained on the occasion of its inauguration in March.  Furthermore, since this spring, little has been transparent about how projects are developed around the Galati Software Park, and there is just an extremely shy site available  urlLink http://www.softwarepark-galati.ro  for common people of Galati or Romania to understand the unitary vision behind the walls of a renovated building and a lit panel in front of which stands the Software Park label. Some soon-to-be fresh graduates dared to post their so called CV in a meet-for-gun manner, although there is no any open job posting. Charts presents the 100% filled capacity, but little information about the small and medium size companies existent or in project to be attracted. Same transparency about representative branches of the big software players or long term cooperation programs with these ones. The discussion forum is empty and no trace of any creative ferment to match the laboratories of the mentioned Software Park.  I guess the 2000 sq.m. should be filled in a way with something, and till software companies will not feel the urge to let themselves attracted by the special conditions  urlLink offered  by this Software Park, some public health units can also be hosted there.  Hmmmm....

						   After trying three times to post a five-rows text, I realized my hand might enjoy some training with the new format of this blog. For various reasons beyond my control I lost the whole text written...so I had to take over..and over...and again over...now it looks like I will finally have a real chance to post it.  So, here I am after a good while since I just left this place rusting. Things happened. First, I decided to take a different road than my former company with whom I was in a "marriage" relationship for about 13 years. Second, I've just embarked in a campaign of job searching and, hopefully, finding. Third, now I do have more time to reflect and, in consequence, to write here about companies and people I've met, or meet, or would like to meet.   Question 1: How did you or do you manage your own job searching campaign?     Question 2: Which was the most odd question you got in an interview and why it seamed like that to you?

						      Motto : Anyone can become angry – it is just simple as that. But to gat mad on who it should, how much it should, when it should, and for the right reason – that is not easy at all.. (Aristotle)      IQ = Intelligence Quotient  – a measure of the inborn human degree of intelligence that usually hardly can be improved over a lifetime. (Goleman, D.,  Emotional Intelligence ).     EQ = Emotional Quotient  – a measure of the capability of control within the following main fields: knowing personal emotions, management of emotions, self-motivation, recognizing emotions in others, manipulating and managing relationships. (Goleman, D.,  Emotional Intelligence ).  A 3000 employees shipyard is a production site acting in accordance with extremely mechanical rules. Huge pieces of ships prevail in front of any employee. People are just ordinary bees whose only mission is to give their work tribute to the mother ship. Rules for people are more important as people themselves. It is a place where frustrations build up and there is no official rule of dealing with frustrations and emotions they produce.  It is a place where many intelligent people (mangers, project managers, engineers, accountants alike) make a joint effort to build something outstanding that will last, float, work and provide safety work conditions for other people for at least 40 years. These shipyard’s people graduated the same shipbuilding faculty, enjoyed more or less the same educational background in high school (either mathematics/physics or mechanics). Education and working place mould them similarly. Some of these people are specialists and look focused on a relatively narrow field of problems, others are coordinators and their prime mission is to manage a portion of the ship project. But most of them have hard times when it comes about communication, interpersonal skills, and dealing with conflict.  Their communication often clashes due to either the frustration embedded by the mechanical system of managing the human resource of the shipyard, or their own inability to deal with personal or other’ people emotions. There are certain prejudices surrounding as a cloud of fog these highly intelligent people and turn them into emotionally deaf bodies:      We (usually men) are strong, we build ships therefore we should be tough. Actually we are tough and people around should see how tough we are.  The higher the hierarchical degree the tougher you should be perceived. If not, you fail to comply with the job requirements at large.  People in top management (the toughest) share privileges and a separate community high above the rest. Women in shipbuilding is an oxymoron. You are a woman, you have emotions, you show other people your emotions, therefore you are weak, therefore you are in contradictory with us (men) who are tough, so you do not pertain to this working place and therefore you should understand us that we will do our best to kick you out of here.   I  (as a skilled specialist) know much better than  YOU  (a project manager or a coordinator) how to do my work, so I am not going to believe any project manager or activity coordinator about when my work should be ready and what kind of resources I am allowed to spend.  Probably there are others too, but these are the most obvious that influence the pool of emotions of the people involved in all managerial levels (from the managing director to the foreman) and all specialists (design engineers, purchasers, accountants, production engineers, quality engineers).  It would be unfair to say all of these people fall in the communication traps at any minute or all of them have hard times in dealing with it. Still, from the general director to many executants, more and more, I got signs that communication is one of the main issues generating temporary conflicts and delays in the shipyard.  Conflicts usually escalates because people fail to convey the right message, at the right moment, to the right person, in the right communication formula or setting, and furthermore deny their need for involvement in it. In addition, a sense of overrated urgency is created that raises even more the conflict. Other times, conflicts are even engineered, because it is the only way to get rid of a still situation and thus a problem can be pushed further and finally solved.  There are various reasons for introducing noise into communication channels:    people bring together with their message also their own unwell managed emotions;   people comply and behave in accordance with the set of the tacit cultural values they have been instilled within their role / position / specialty right from their day 1 in the company.   While items 1 and 2 above are a bit like hen and egg problem, there are several ways in which people fail to manage their emotions not only in such a work environment but in general:   the inability to recognize the emotion one is facing;   the inability to manage sufficiently the emotions so that to get rid of the feeling of anxiety, depression, fear and move on decisively;   the inability to permanently assess opportunities and find the self-motivation; the inability of being emphatic which makes people to fail understanding others or to see the world around through various perspective, leading to the  only  truth accepted – that of  mine ;   the inability of managing relationships this being translated into the inability in managing emotions of others; this leads to low popularity and inability of coping with other’s emotions, attitudes and stances and in time to a low profile employee.    In his book  Emotional Intelligence , Goleman draws attention about the fact that little correlation exists between IQ and EQ. However, IQ and EQ are separate competencies rather than contradictory. I found it interesting in this book a description of the profiles of men and women with either the IQ or EQ inexistent. Of course, these pure IQ and EQ types are exaggerations, but one can immediately spot the implications over such people lives and those around them.    Men with pure IQ Men with pure EQ   1. have various and many intellectual interests; 1. are balanced from social point of view; 2. are ambitious, productive, predictable; 2. are outgoing and likeable; 3. are apparently in control of own worries; 3. never fall under own worries; 4. are over criticizing others; 4. have high dedication to people; 5. are extremely polite in their circle; 5. ability to assume responsibility; 6. are hardly satisfied or inhibited; 6. have high ethical profile; 7. have sexual problems; 7. are understanding in relationships; 8. have poor sensual experience; 8. have a rich emotional life; 9. are detached and distant; 9. are at ease with their self and others.   Women with pure IQ Women with pure EQ   1. are intellectual confidence; 1. are assertive and decisive; 2. are fluent in expressing their thoughts; 2. are direct in expressing thoughts; 3. appreciate intellectual issues; 3. have positive feeling about themselves; 4. have high range of intellectual interests; 4. consider life has a meaning for them; 5. have an introspective tendency; 5. are outgoing, likeable, spontaneous; 6. fall under their own worries and this “kills” them; 6. express feelings in an appropriate way 7. have a continuous guilt feeling; 7. do not regret afterwards their deeds; 8. hesitate to express anger directly; 8. adapt well to stressful conditions; 9. express their anger indirectly; 9. skilled in making contacts 10. are open to sensual experiences; 11. are at ease with their self and others.  In a work place of the XXI century, EQ competency should become a must requirement for many of the specialist, management or coordination jobs, especially in a project setting. It is considered that only 20% of one’s success in life is due to a high IQ, the rest of 80% is due to high emotional intelligence competencies. Emotional intelligence can be improved in practice, one have just to want to become aware about own needs and the requirements of his private or work environment. But are there the main education systems in Romania able to deliver programs for training from early ages the future adults into such competency at the moment? Are the trainers involved enough EQ proficient to set themselves as behavioral models? Or just another category of highly intelligent people.
