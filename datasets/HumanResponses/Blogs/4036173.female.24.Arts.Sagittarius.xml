      I just wanted to play around with posting more pics to see how well I understand this process.     Here is Brian eating some ice cream a while back. He likes ice cream.          Here is Melanie's eye and contact up close...           Speaking of Melanie, she is moving away from San Marcos pretty soon. She is moving to Dallas and Houston or something... but anyway, we will miss seeing her. She better come and visit still!  That was also Melanie sitting on the concrete in the previous post...  Anyway... better get ready for work now. :)

       Lately I have really lost sight of who and what I am, what I enjoy, and what I am interested in. I had been so completely wrapped up in another person's life that I forgot all of me. I had been trying so hard to "be a part" of his life and what is going on in it, that I had been neglecting myself. I don't really know what I want to do, or really what I want now out of this situation, but I know that it really can't go on the way that it has been. I think I am in the beginning stages of getting out of the rut. I usually just go crazy with wanting to know what he is doing, or what he is thinking, or what he is planning, or what he, he, he, he... right now, I am feeling so many things. Anger, hurt, resentment, spring to mind first. Then dissapointment, in both myself and the expectations that I had put upon him and our relationship. I thought that we were both caring people, now I think he doesn't know how to care. I'm sure that the feelings that he thinks he portrays are the reflections of emotions that he thinks are appropriate, but really, they are empty. My heart and mind and soul are divided equally at this time, I feel pulled in his direction, but equally pushed away. I don't know what is the right choice, I think I am going to see how things play out and play it cool for a while... give him the chance to do something. I will try not to set him up to fail.

       Well, so far today I have gotten some stuff done. I deposited my check, washed my car, and went to Target. I bought 2 pairs of shoes, usually that puts me in a pretty good mood, but today it didn't work. I think it may be because my boyfriend and I are having problems. I need to take my DVD player back to Wal-Mart and get a new one. The one I have sucks and won't even turn on. Bah.

       Today I woke up at noon. I just let my body wake up on its own. For the past four days I was running on almost no sleep. I think I added it up and and in 72 hrs, I had slept maybe 10 hrs. Anyway, now I have stuff to do for the rest of my day off today and as usual I don't know what I want to do first. I think I will eat lunch, go wash my car, maybe go to Target, Wal-Mart, or HEB, or maybe all three. Oh, and I need to deposit my check. Okay... later.

       This is my very first blog post.  I am totally bored right now and just really want to see if I like this... well... I think maybe I can use this to get thoughts out of myself and just really play around.  Here goes nothing.

      Well, today was my first day at my new job working at the phone company.   I am only in training right now so it isn't bad at all.  Getting paid for not much work.   Not hard work, anyway.   I'm  sure at some point it will either get hard, or boring, or both, I may end up hating it, but I am hoping not.  I am trying to keep at good attitude.  It would be great if I like it, it is so conveniant from the relationship of my apartment.  I think I will start walking once I get in a routine.  Anyway, on a different note, this past weekend was kinda weird.   A group of 10 friends and myself went tubing down the Guadalupe River in New Braunfels.   It was my first time to go tubing.  I fell getting in the water down some rocks and banged my leg up pretty bad.   Other than that, it was pretty chill to just float down the river with a bunch of friends and some beer.  Not bad.   Afterwards the rest of the weekend followed with a little bit of oddness but I think it was just from exhaustion and what not.   Anyway... all in all was good.   Tonight I brushed my teeth longer than I normally do, and I think there really is something to that brushing for two minutes idea.  My teeth feel really clean.   I'm silly.  Anyway... I need to get ready for bed, have to be at work at 8am.

      ... today I turned in my resignation at work.  My last day at that awful place is this Friday.  Unfortunately that is the first day of tax-free weekend. I am not looking forward to it for that reason, but I am looking forward to it being my last day at Saks.  I am anxious to get out of there.  Although I met some pretty cool people there, actually most of the employees are nice...it is just the management that sucks.  Anyway, I hope that I will have more productive free time when I start my new job (assuming I am going to pass the drug test...).  I need to start learning to space twice after a period.   I usually only space once. What's up with that? Anyway, back with the subject of Saks, I think that I am going to bake the people some cheese cake, because I like most of them.  I need to get to bed, Brian is going to call to tell me goodnight soon.
