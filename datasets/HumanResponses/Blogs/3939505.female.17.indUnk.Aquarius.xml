          Well today waz an ordinary day.. woke up late and then went tubin with Vanessa and Tiffany.. it was a nice day to tube.. When we were done tubin Warren informed us of the turtle on the road.. we just had to save it!! So kinda crepped out and all we grabbed the turtle with my shirt and put him in the trunk... The turtle was rather large... well we took that turtle, whom we called Stella.. for a lil joy ride around then we put it back in the river!! yahh!! Turtle saved!! In the evening we went to town.. after waiting an hour so we could get spiffed up.. we went to town.. we picked up Warren and then travelled to Tim Hortons.. on the way home  we left Warren and Tiffany alone .. breifly..we left them on the side of the road and drove off...  I have come to realize that "borrowing" road signs and other stuff is fun!! lol

      Well yesterday I went swimmin at the oxbow.. it was so friggin hot out that i thought i was gunna melt!!! It sucked cuz I walked to the river but then I got cooled off but then I had to walk home so once agin I roasted.. lol but all waz good lol... on the way home we found a baby bird who was just learnin to fly.. it was on the road so we thought it woood be a good idea to take him home.... We put him in a big,card-board box and then went inside.. While inside we relized that Sassy, a once thought as a female cat... was really a male cat... lol..  I went ouside later to find an empty box and Sassy all riled up...she killed our baby bird!!!!!! Furthermore, an hour later I went outside to see the Dog, Morgan, eating the lil bird!!... and what have we learned from this?.. One must not tamper with mother nature lol!!!.. poor bird!

          U know life is very very scary sumtimes... hahahah... and sumtimes yah get freaked out..especially if it's 2 am and a big scart animal is tryin to attack.. well here's what happened:  It was an ordinary day for me and a couple of my friends...Tiffany and Vanessa... well we were goin through this faze that we loved to sleep in tents.. that has changed.. and we once again decided to sleep in the tent. We up and decided that we must put the tent furthest fromthe house so we pitched it back at the border of the woods...in Tiff's field.. well it was cold and Vanessa was always snorin and sayin things in her sleep like "Dont bang that door!", I think that was it...so it waz hard to fall asleep... I drifted off then I heard the pleein voice of Tiff sayin'"Carolyn!I'm convulsin' I have 2 go in!".. well bein tired of bein cold I agreed 2 go into.. so we woke Vanessa up and gathered up what we could...but then I heard it!!!!! "GRRRR GRRRRRR" stopm stomp stomp..well it was a scary noise of sumthin either of us have ever herd b4 so we were scared shitless...The thing stomed and sniffed around us for about 5 minutes then Tiff said we had to go.. so I ran.. and ran and ran.. and didnt stop runnin.. I was so scared!!!It was the scariest thing ever!! Tiff and I were up all nite becuz I was bothered and I just dont think the gurl sleeps lol  It waz scary...and what bugz me is that we dont know exactly what it wazz..but all I know is that I am never gunna sleep near woods ina tent agin!! Oh and Tiff yur stories didnt help either!!The ghost ones..afterwards!! lol WEll BYE!  !!
