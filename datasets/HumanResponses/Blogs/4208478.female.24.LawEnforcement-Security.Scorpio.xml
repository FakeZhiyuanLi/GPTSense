						   Ever get up one morning and know that you should stay in bed but, you get up brush your teeth, run your fingers through your hair, put on the cleanest dirty uniform you have, the closest thing to matching socks you got, dig around in pockets for keys, walk out to the same ole beat up car get in, turn on the same ole radio station put, on the same ole seat belt and drive the same ole roads to work.  Well I do the same thing every morning and every morning i forget something somedays it is a hair scrunchie for my beautiful jailhouse job, or my duty belt (batmans x-mas gift).  Most often it's something less noticeable things like my purse with my drivers license or my money.  Well let me give you some background on the brown bomb and then maybe this will help you out.  In my younger and more intelligent days I got a 97 F150 and loved it dearly moved to hell whole Oklahoma and lost it along with some ego and various pant sizes.  Well to replace it my folks allowed me to drive a 1980 chevy 3/4 ton pickup that has caught on fire, and left us stranded as a young family on 287 on the coldest day of the year.  Needless to say I've blown atleast one engine out of it and would rather walk then drive it.  It is tawny  brown with a creme hood and drives like a tank, corners like a dumpster on a skateboard, and chokes and gags like a 90 year old smoker.  Not a pretty site needless to say people will move out of your way.  The thing is such a mess it has a gas tank in the back of it, I look of it more as a target behind the driver.  Perfect for road-ragers.  It stands about 4 ft of the bed of the truck and in traditional form has a hazard sign with flames (known as the bulls eye).  Well in order to check to see how much gas you have my dad has taken wooden sticks and marked them and you simply dip them into the tank and shazam you know how far you are going to have to walk.  Well one morning while I was doing my same ole routine, I left my duty belt in the house and was running late and didn't check for gas. Not to mention it was about 530am and there isn't a Brede child within a hundred years that functions before noon.  I make it to work finish out a hard day and head home at about 3pm (1500)  about 20 minutes into my hour drive home the truck dies and sputters to the side of the road, and of course it happens way to far out of town to walk back.  I set in the truck and beat my head on the steering wheel and screamed in frustration more at the fact that the gas fairy had missed me again, then at the fact it was hot I was sweating and I had no way for anyone to know I was broke down or for anyone to come and get me, always a good feeling.   After about 25 cars passed me I gave up not one person stoped (must have been the truck) , finally I see an older truck with an older couple slow down and I notice the Texas License plate and think yes! I am saved lol they were slowing down to turn on the road behind me.  I had given up hope as more, and more cars passed, I finally decided that at dark I would grab all my gear and walk the 25 miles home, when that older white pickup with the little old couple pulled slowly up beside me and asked if I needed to use a phone.  GOD LOVE YOU GUYS,  I almost cried, they allowed me to use the phone I called for backup, passed back the phone and thanked them.  The only thing I have to say is Thank God there was a Texan in Oklahoma that day or I would be sitting on the side of the road this very day.  Needless to say the gas fairy hasn't shown her pretty little face, and I think it's a good thing I'd hate to have to rearange her gas card.   Much Love and check the gas tank.

						   It is now middle August, and as I look forward and behind and all around all I can see is how things are changing.  School starts on the 23rd I've got a full load.   I still haven't moved not to mention even packed yet.  The Summer is quickly coming to a close my tan is fading, my horse is fat, and I am changing jobs.    It seems like my plate couldn't be fuller.    The hot wind blows, and the hot sun shines down and it is 8pm welcome to Oklahoma the worlds largest blow dryer, not to mention cess pool.  (did i say that outloud)   I suppose there are worse places like some little dive in southwest tx... hehehheheheh ( love Tejas, winks)  Lawton is like little Chicago just some little town with big town problems. Youth with guns, middle aged teens with drugs, and senior citizen 20 year olds with phat rides.  (lol) just a glimpse of my world.  Well I hope that as these changes happen, good things happen with them.   I wish ya all the best.  and Rob cool site chica.

						   THIS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY POST THAT WILL REMAIN A PERMANENT FIXTURE.   MARIA NICKELS WAS 22 YEARS OLD WITH A 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND ON THE 9TH OF AUGUST 2004 AT 1430 MARIA NICKELS WAS KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT OUTSIDE OF LAWTON OKLAHOMA.  IN THE VEHICLE SHE HAD HER 6 YEAR OLD DAUGHTER AND HER SISTER ALONG WITH A CLOSE FRIENDS DAUGHTER.  MARIA WAS THROWN FROM HER VEHICLE AND CRUSHED AS THE 00' FORD EXPLORER SPORT ROLLED OVER.  FORTUNATLY MARIA WAS THE ONLY FATALITY AND ALTHOUGH EVERYONE HAD SERIOUS INJURIES THEY ARE EXPECTED TO LIVE A FULL LIFE.  MARIA WORKED, AT COMANCHE COUNTY DETENTION CENTER IN LAWTON OKLAHOMA, SHE ALWAYS HAD A SMILE ON HER FACE AND NEVER HAD A BAD DAY.  MARIA WAS SOMEONE WHO HAD OVERCOME MANY THINGS IN HER LIFE AND WOULD TELL YOU AT THE DROP OF A HAT HOW IMPORTANT HER DAUGHTER, BOYFRIEND, AND FAMILY WERE TO HER.   IT IS SAD THAT WE HAD TO LOSE MARIA, AND I HOPE NOONE EVER HAS TO FEEL THE PAIN.  REMEMBER YOUR LOVED ONES AND TELL THEM EVERYDAY. LIFE IS SHORT.  FOR THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT THIS STATEMENT MEANS TREASURE THE MOMENTS THAT WERE THERE ("DON'T GET DEAD")
