        *he,he* those lyrics are so true to most people... but not for me!     Yesterday I just realised how I'm not a robot! Isnt that great! *blah* Well, I'm not insane or anything... but Nick and I used to talk about how I do everything for other people. From people like Jessie to&nbsp;him... but yeah. I dunno, I feel so bad if I dont wanna go shopping with Jessie and tell her to f*ck off. Man, I hate her, but like, because I feel bad about telling her to go away so I end up going and being her "best friend" and I'm sick of acting! I mean,&nbsp;I like it when people tell me shit, like their problems and stuff cos it let me know that poeple kinda trust me. And everyone needs someone to talk to. So yeah, I like being that someone because I know people are letting their thoughts out and stuff.   But I dont&nbsp;like it&nbsp;cos I'm so sick of trying to handle everything and last time I didnt help someone when they were uspet they killed themself and left me phone calls and crap just before they did it.   Like, if theres something I wanna do   and something Ramona wants to do (that I really dont wanna do) I'll end up going with Ramona maybe its cos I know shes upset and wants to talk and I wanna be that someone there for them. I act happy, and smile, and act all intrested in their lives and everything but inside I'm screaming... I just want out... I wanna be free from&nbsp;it.   I dont know what to do anymore, be a slefish bitch and start to do stuff I want to do. Or just be the person who people come to for comfort. Thats the thing, I like the sound of the second one. It sounds so nicer... besides all the things I like to do are way too expensive&nbsp;- flying / sky diving / racing / travelling the world / etc. So, till I get a steady gob and alot of money I'll be the person here for others. The person who comforts... The person to turn to when theres no one else around... etc

       Okay, this is gonna be a long as hell post cos it pretty much explains my life... and whats going on... and stuff.   Well, I started this year at Swinburne Senior Secondary College. There everyone new mingles with everyone else, and we all pretty quickly fell into random groups.   In our "lets-chill-in-the-common-room" group we had: April, Nickie, Kate, TJ, Shawn, Andrew, Nick,&nbsp;Leon annnd Myeself.   We all got along really well actually... then after a while everyone became kinda bored and some people left, others joined, everyone moped around.    I mean, you cant expect something to stay as good as it is from the start.Everything has its new and exciting hype to it for a while, then it dies down and you can see how everything really is - thats the way I see it at least.   Anyways, after a while on a Friday Night (Friday the 19th of march to be exact) I kissed Nick. Then we didn't really get to talk about it properly till the following Monday. Where we confirmed our relationship and love for each other.   Everything was going soo well for the first three months, going to movies / laughing and chilling at each others places / telling some of our life stories / trusting each other /etc.   Then gradually Nick seemed to be kinda down, moped around a whole lot more. I tried everything I could to to make him cheer up: go to his favorite places, go shopping, smile and tell personal jokes, ask if he wants to talk and get something off his shoulders, everything god damn it.   See, after a few days of this I was trying to work out why he was so down. I mean, he always tells me if theres a problem with school, a problem with his family, a problem with friends... he tells me everything. So I boiled it down to he had a problem with me.I went into his e-mail cos I know he talks to this girl "Kate" whenever hes worried about me.    Instead of the usual "Christine's really nice, and I don't wanna see her upset. I'd die if anything happened to her" stuff there were multiple emails along the lines of:   "I've been missing you. I cant wait to meet you. I'd defiantly alter the truth to my girlfriend just to be with you. I don't wanna be a cheater but god if I could kiss you I'd do it in two seconds. I dream about you and your so sexy. I think about you when I'm with her." kinda stuff   Now as I read that I could feel my heart break, not just break, but crumble into a thousand pieces.   I printed them up, and went to his house. It was late, I knocked on the door and went straight to him.   "why are you here?" he asks kinda worried   "I'm upset, I needed someone to talk to"   *he takes me to his room where I hug him and ask him if he loves me*   He replys so sincerely "YES! Honey, of course I do"   *my heart crumbles even more and I kiss him, then ask if he'd ever cheat on me*   "Oh my god, NO... I love you. I keep telling you I'd NEVER do something like that"   Thats when I stand back and say "f*ck you"   He looks confused so I show him the e-mails I printed   "how did you get these?"   "thats not the point, the point is that you wrote them. You felt that way..."   He doesn't reply, just sits down and scans over the things I highlighted like "cheater" "dream about you" "alter the truth to my girlfriend" "She has too many problems" kinda stuff   I go on and talk about how much I trusted him, how I gave him my body, my life, told him everything, how I loved him, and how I didn't understand that he could love some American chick hes never met more than me...    I was so god damn hurt and angry I was so surprised how I kept so calm.   I left and then went on MSN at home, he was all "I feel sick /&nbsp;I deserve to die / I'm such a f*ck up" That made me so angry cos hes the one who hurt me, and he didn't even apoligies... he just sat there and wallowed in self pitty. Fuck hes so selfish...    Anyways, by that time I was swearing at him and yelling at him over MSN. Agreeing that its hes fault and stuff.   I couldn't sleep... The next day I was torn apart cos I still love him so, I went straight on MSN and he was there. I talked to him about why he did it&nbsp;and then came the list of explanations:    "She was upset" &nbsp;  *Every girl is upset, so now are you gonna go lead on any girl who's upset behind your girlfriends back?!?!*     "She was American" &nbsp;  *Oh that brings me a whole lotta trust in you. So much for us going to America together, I wonder how many girls he's be with behind my back over there?!?!*     "She said those things so I just said them back" &nbsp;  *Great, so now if anyone flirts with you you'll go for them... man, if someone flirted with me I'd tell em to f*ck off cos I have a b/f. Man, shows how much love you have for me*     "She bought me a present" &nbsp;  *OMFG, now do I have to worry every time someone buys you something. F*ck, if you want something just ask and I'll try and get it for ya.*     "We were having problems" &nbsp;  *Just cos we wernt as happy as we were at the start doesn't mean you go running off to other girls. Everything dies down a bit, then you find out stuff and work through each others thoughts together. Not do what you did*     "It was all a lie" &nbsp;  *I don't know whats the truth anymore to be honest. I cant tell your lies or whatever. For all I know it was as real as anything...*    And the list goes on for another twenty minutes.   *deep sigh*   I talked this through with my best friend, my sister, and my mum. All of them told me something along the lines that his a bullshit arsewhole cheating back-stabbing lier.   So when I was at his place I talked about reasons, and what went wrong. In the end I put it down to what everyone else said. I was amazed at how much of an asswhole he was! It scared me, and then I realised how f*cked up his life is, how he cant trust anyone, and that he refuses to see a shrink even though he has problems.   So I said "Man, you are how I was 2 years ago. You have so many f*cking problems, you refuse to talk, your so negative, all you do is complain, I'm gonna be your friend and try to help you..."   Then we got along really well, he told me all his feeling and thoughts. On alot of issues, after a while he and I were both smiling and stuff. I found it a lil hard still cos I was still head over heals in love with the guy...He wanted some company so he asked me to stay for Jarassic Park.   By the end of the night we kissed and I left.The next day at school we ended up kinda half being back together, we were so much happier because we talked and stuff, and now he knows to show me his feelings.   But I cant stop thinking about what he wrote. See when I'm with him, I don't remember the e-mails. All I remember is the great times we shared together, I'm happy with him.   But when hes not with me I worry about who hes talking to, what hes saying, where he goes, what hes thinking.   I guess even though we're now back together its perfectly normal to feel paranoid about it. Especially when someone like him lies so well. I mean, the trust scale went from 90% to negative 299%. He knows he fucked up, he knows that if I ever find out something like this happened again I wouldn't give him another chance, he know that he can work back the trust, and he knows that its gonna be a long hard road back to the top.   Got my fingers crossed for the best now...   Just hope it all works out!
