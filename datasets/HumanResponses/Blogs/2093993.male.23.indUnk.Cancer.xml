      can't sleep...  worked on another website today,...tried using flash, but the F1 help file didn't really teach me anything, so i downloaded Swish, so I could flash without flash. gotta say, i'm pretty happy with the result, although i wish i had a nice digital camera so the pictures wouldn't be so dang pixely...

      back in rotterdam, back in my bed. I can't believe how lonely i feel now that I can't see Greena without a monitor in the way.    Time to cheer myself up... might catch a movie tommorow to distract myself. planning a trip to six flags sometime soon... need recruits. anyone interested?

        urlLink     I decided to upload (to deviantart & forum kamera) one of the photos i took of Greena after the mannequin session. at this point, I think this one is better than what i've managed to get during the actual session. Tommorow I'll get the results from my F2 shoots, we'll see how those turned out. fingers crossed....&nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink Picasa   Downloaded this today, pretty much kicks ass as far as i can tell. then again, all you bloggers out there are probably aware of the existence of this nifty little program. for those of you who have tons and tons of photos and images stored in categories, or for those who   want  to categorize their photos, this is the program. a great album software, and it's free! no adware thingies i'm aware of as yet...

       urlLink DNA/The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy   After having heard about this book on numerous previous occasions, I finally picked up a copy of the first book a few months ago. After a fairly brief read, it was over, and I was left wanting more. Thankfully, the 4 sequels which make up this trilogy (yes, it's a trilogy) were all available as one big blue book at bargain price. I would've liked to have the nice black stylish hardcover books, but individually, they cost a bit less than what i paid for the collection. One can't really complain when the content is this good.  For those of you who have yet to read this cult classic and its sequels, I urge you to do so as soon as possible... it definitely ranks along the top of my best read list.   As for what the books are actually about, well... it's kind of hard to explain. basically, some british dude hitches a ride on a spaceship right before the earth is demolished to make way for a galactic byway of sorts, and from there he and a mix of very interesting characters go through a lot to find the question to the answer of Life, the Universe, and Everything (the answer happens to be 42, btw). It will leave you confused but happy, it's so... oh, just go and find a copy, will ya?

          To be perfectly honest, I totally forgot that this blog exists. Only after receiving an email from a good friend of mine regarding his blog did I remember.     Reading where I left of, I yet again am reminded of my unsatiable urge to make new websites for myself. Since my last post (October 2003) there have been a few websites that have come and gone which I have claimed to be mine.    I finally moved out of the crime-scene of an apartment in favor for a nice cozy place with Shinta &amp; Turkka. It's been a great 7 months so far.      During this time as well I have been introduced to many changes in my life, while miniscule at the moment, might prove to be quite significant for my future. One of these things is photography. Fast forward from my last blog entry and rewind from this one, back (or forward) to December 2003, when and elective photography course I took at school motivated me to start taking pictures,...nice pictures. I can't really say that my stuff is super cool and awesome, but in my own eyes at least, I'm pretty proud of what I've managed to conjure with my brick of a camera. I'm hoping, praying, dreaming, that a chance of incorporating photography into my future career will present itself, or rather that i'd have the guts to create my own chances.      Some things change, some things don't.    Sometimes, things are a bit of a mish mash of both. My love for Greena has not changed, and yet, and increase would be considered a change, no? I love her more than ever, I have kept on loving her, and I will keep on loving her. :)      Other things change sooner than you realize.    Another event that occured during the rather significant gap between my last post is that Stephanie, my sister, got married. she got hitched. transformed into a metal ball with a nice chain attached. All joking aside, I feel that I sometimes don't realize that this has happened. I tend to keep thinking that we're still teenagers, she's still my big sister who I look up to (probably without her realizing it), and not as someone's wife. and probably in a little while, someone's mother. Then again, she'll always be my big sister whom i look up to. Some things change, some things don't.        so lets see how far this attempt at blogging goes. i say about 3 or 4 entries before i blank out and forget it exists. again.
