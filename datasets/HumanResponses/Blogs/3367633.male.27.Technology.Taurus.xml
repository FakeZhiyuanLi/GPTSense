      So I applied for the job down in Huntington today. Well by email since a email came out to the cs center down there this week.   cool new song I am listing to.   Dress me Up (English Version) sung by: Olivia  Why are you looking at me like that? I do not feel a very good vibe Why are you pushing me away? (Well) Now It's not like I really want to stay  Oh I, I might be small but it doesn't mean I can't reach the sky I, I might be weak but it doesn't mean you can knock me down  Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet  Why aren't you giving me a chance I have a way of my own Why are you being so damn crude Hey Look! You are a human being like me  Oh I, I might trip and fall but it doesn't mean that I don't know how to stand tall I, Don't look like her but I am glad as hell I am, who I am  Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet Don't Dress me Up   I'm already dressed I've something to say You don't know what I can do And you don't know who I am  Don't Tear me Up Into many pieces You can't touch my soul You better get used to it Cause, I'm not going no where Don't Dress me Up I'm already dressed Do you like my shoes? Why are you turning away? You haven't seen nothing yet  Don't Dress me Up Dress me up You haven't seen nothing yet

      Its a kinda anticy feeling today. You know? I am going to dinner with Katie and Andrea tonight, well we are going to have dinner over at andreas house and then head out to see shaolin soccer. It looks interesting but I think its mostly me and katie's style of fun. But who knows Andrea might really like it. Don't get me wrong I like Andrea a lot and she is katie's sister but I don't think she expresses her true feelings about stuff like that.   Any ways, I still haven't seen the posting for the job down in Huntington. I have mixed feelings about it. I don't want to leave Katie and Alec up here by them selves but then I have autumne, Jesse, Dale, Kyle, Tony, Kevin, Ed, Mike down there that I would really love to see again and hang out with. My first choice if I had a choice would be to move to Henderson to be with Aaron and Amanda. I would give any thing if I could but I know I know I cant right now because of the way the economy is and how hard it is to find a job there.

      god damn by back hurts today. I hate this when I sleep all funky like I get a sore back. Nothing is out of place but some reason it feels like I pulled a muscle. Oh well advil is on its way to help out. That and they give us nice chairs for work here.   got good news for my friend Alec yesterday. DeeDee the hr lady says that they are going to call him in for a interview soon. Yah good news. If he can get a job then his life would be happier and making my friends happy is all good for me.   still waiting for the posting to come up on the Huntington job.

      I went to the doctors again yesterday to get my hepitias shot(apparently there is a big out break of it in the Seattle area) and now my arm is completely useless.  owwwwww.  I spent the weekend with my parents and they got me a few star trek novels(presumably at a garage sale or auction, as that's what my parents do). Now don't get me wrong I like the books and such but my parents are really out of touch. I would have much rather had a gift certificate to a store or some thing so I could buy some thing I needed. Its not that I don't appreciate the thought or the stuff but just in this time of my life its little things like laundry soap that make my life easier(god how sad is that).

      I sit there today at my computer desk at work and i am blankly staring on the screen wondering what is the point some times. then i realise money. its all about money lol.   I think my office mate used to be a sailor. all he does is cuss all day long and goes on the weirdest tangents.   I saw kill bill2 last night. I thought it was very good and i cant wait for the two movies to be mixed back together. that should be a good movie.  I am going over to see my father today and visit with him before he leaves again for the summer.

      So I get an IM today from my ex coworker in Lexington. Apparently there is a lot of stuff they are putting onto the people. All sorts of dev stuff and a lot of projects. I am thinking about asking ed if I can temp work down there for the summer. Who knows it might happen.   While we were talking, he told me that Tony was called back to active duty. These were two of the people I cared for most in Lexington while I was there. I don't want to see Tony go back to Iraq. Yeah he may be in the communications area but that doesn't mean that he wont see possible fire fights or even a possible suicide bomber. Some people don't understand that war is hell and that to support people who pursue war as one would a piece of ass is a total travesty.

      Well again like normal I am tired this morning LOL. I just think that I need to get my sleeping habits down to a schedule he.   As I was walking by the free book self today I picked up two new books. One was called hatchet jobs and the other one was called desiderata. Both a hard cover book which is rare on the free shelf. I think I need a vacation to read all the books I have been collecting. LOL I think a vacation would be a good idea either way.  So the guy I share my office came back from vacation today. Damn and I was getting so used to being in here alone. Don't get me wrong he is a nice guy but he doesn't seem to grasp the simple things you tell him. Like he had his computer replaced over the time he was gone and I told him that he will have to call the help desk to have his password changed before he can log in. What does he do, he tries to log in and then says his cant. LOL some people he.

      I went to the doctors today. I guess its the first time I have talked to a doctor about my sexual side. Its strange to tell a complete stranger about some thing personal as sex. Oh well. At least the receptionist was funny. She was a pre opt transexual. If I hadn't spent all the time around deserie in Lexington I don't think I would have known.   I decide to have all the normal std test done. Hep and Hiv being the two most perdomiate ones.   I tried to lift up the pad on the desk i got the other day and found out that its a solid green pad. not wood at all.

      I got this in a message from a friend today and I thought that I would share.   amznbert: happy with our selfish...Hard task to do all the time. But hey its worth the fight right?   as3367: There's not much else that's worth that kind of effort. Its the key to being happy in life, and being able to get through whatever it throws our way.      I think that I have been feeling a little macobb recently because I lost sight of what I wanted out of life and what really motivates me. I spent almost three years in Kentucky trying to find that out. I though I had at one point. I knew that I was comfortable with my self and had things going prity well to. I just need to find that rhythm again and learn to dance a new step.

      I got home around 12 o'clock last night. I was working at a friends house on his computer trying to get a install of XP to work for him. I don't know what was going on but it would just blank screen right after the post.  I think I am going to give up on dating for right now until I either pay off my debts or until I move. I just want to be able to focus on the guy when I do. I picked up a Cisco network cert book yesterday. I think I will study for that for the next few weeks and see if I can get my certification before the job in Huntington opens up.   I worked a little on a desk that I got over the weekend. Its a really nice desk that just needs to be sanded down and re stained. I picked up the stain but I think I will need some more sand paper, LOL its a big desk.   How do I feel today? Good question. I am not too sure. Some times I feel like crying some times I feel like running away, but through all of that I know I cant and I wont. Some times I feel like taking off of work and hitting a bar or crawling back into bed. I wonder if they will notice if I crawl under my desk and take a nap. I guess above it all I feel the twinge of wanderlust hitting me. Its sort of like that tom petty song "last dance with Mary Jane". I think I am plagued with the curse that most Americans have of indecision and impulse. I cant make up my mind until face with a shiny new object.

      I feel mad at the world today I guess. I am just in one of those grumpy moods that make you wish you could crawl back into bed. I get a IM from my cousin saying that his wife stepped in dog pee this morning. So? I know its my responcablity to clean it up and I grateful accept that. Its one of the things you have to do with a dog. I love my dog dearly too. But it doesn't mean that its some thing that has to be brought up at work.   I am seriously thinking about applying for the job down in Huntington again. I love my cousin and really do like his wife(even with the strange passive aggressiveness she has) I really need to live with some one else. There is too many expectations with very little communication about what people think they are in that place. Plus I would love to live by my self or with some friends again since I can not seem to separate my life style from theirs. Oh well I think I just need to work a little harder at it.

      I had a dream last night that I normal do when I watch too much of one show. I dreamed that I was sucked into the TV world and still knew all about the show and what happens to everyone on the show. Its all very strange to me. Its not that I feel that I can change the out come of the events in the show just that I always try to find a way to hid in the back ground and watch what's going on. Its just a strange dream I guess.   Man its cold in my office today and I am feeling a little bit upset at what I don't know. I just hope I get the job in Huntington. I am feeling the need to get out of this place big time.

      Damn I hate working in a place where you have to wary of the phone. There has been tone of social engineering lately. People calling to get info about other people in the company. Oh well let them try to get it out of me.   So pride was this weekend. I should have gone to just seen what it was like. Apparently from some of the pics I have seen its quite interesting. I went to the gym instead with rusty and shanda. Not bad really, though I wanted to do an half to an hour on the elliptical runners and they couldn't even finish 10 mins. I can understand them not being able to do that much though. Rustys has skin issues because his belly hangs over his waist so much. And shanda has ankle issues as well. But the pool was good and the steam room was very relaxing.

      I was just over at my friends aarons blog and was looking at random peoples blogs there, man are those people really angry. But I guess that's what these things are for some times. I am glad that they are using these as an outlet and such in its way is a good thing. People expressing their feelings on the web instead of in real life. But hey even that can have a negative impact as the last killing in Japan showed. Some girl posted a negative thing about her friend and then her friend killed her because she wouldn't remove it.   I am always reminded of the story of Pandora and her box. Even after all the bad things were released into the world, Hope was first thing to be found as it was waiting right under the lid.

      They say that anticipation is the sweetest part of wanting. I think that's a big pile of crap. Anticipation is never wracking and depressing. But oh well we learn to be patient when we are kids and some things never change in the world I guess.   SO the job for Huntington still hasn't been posted. I don't know when it will be. Things are going to get strange and weird all over here if that doesn't get done soon. I will have to do a lot of stuff before I leave if do. I said I would replace the carpet in my room with hard wood because of the stains on the floor from when erein was still being potty trained and I wanted it for my self. Ohh well i will deal with that when i get to it.

      Take breath is all you can do some times to get from one moment to the other. I think that some times the anticipation of the next breath is what keeps us breathing some times. LOL I have no idea what that was about.   So I had my interview for the job down in Huntington today. It was very very pleasant and very quick, only 25 mins. Its nice to interview with some one you have worked with for a job he knows you did. The funny thing is that the job is still not posted and I don't think my manager knows yet or not. Ohio well as soon as its posted he will know as my application is going to go in. By talking to him today it looks like the job would start some time in mid July.   My friend Alec has his interview with fraud today. I am so happy for him. Its a nice job and I think that he will do wonders in the position.

      So its been a while since I posted. My fault I guess. I guess I keep protesting this kind of thing. I always think that my life is so boring that some time I wonder what's the point of writing it all down. I guess that strange things make you take some thing up and put them down again. I guess that the some thing that make you take up some thing is powerful enough to influence us to do some thing is some thing to take notice of.   So a new thing for me I guess is that I picked up a new author two days ago. The book I found on the free shelf was called "a prison diary", after 10 pages I was hooked on the book. I don't know what it was but the guy was a very very good writer. Today I was lucky to find several books on CD by the same author and I'm now listing to "Not a penny more, not a penny less" its a very very good so far.

      Yeah I am at my 7th day in a row for work right now and still the rest of today and tomorrow to go before getting to go on my weekend.   I have queued up my playlist so I don't have to keep fumbling for the mp3 player each time I wanted some thing to play. Though white town has been running through my mind all day.   Started to put together my new liger x zero last night got too tired to finish it. I just hope the dogs don't decide to eat some of the parts.  some thing strange happened the other day. I feel asleep for about 20mins on the couch and when I woke up my left eye didn't want to focus. At first it was like both eyes didn't focus for the first 15-20 seconds, but that is normal, but when the right eye focused and the left one didn't I started to Blink and stuff to make it clear out just in case some thing was wrong with it. But none of that worked. This lasted for about 2 hours. I am thinking in need to go see the eye doctors some time next week.        It's calling, from somewhere within my breast I want to always dream of dreams that make my heart dance Though the sadness is countless I'm sure that beyond it, I can see you  With each mistake they repeat, people Understand the blueness of the plain blue sky Though the road may seem to continue without end These hands of mine can embrace the light  The silent heart when the time comes for parting The body, which will return to nothing, listens closely The mystery of living, and the mystery of dying Is the same for all, even the flowers, the wind, and the streets  It's calling, from somewhere within my breast Let's draw our dreams, countlessly forever Rather than saying all there is to say about sadness Let's use those same lips to sing softly  Listen to the whisper I don't want to forget Within the closing memories Even in a mirror shattered to bits The new scenery will be reflected  The quiet window at the start of morning Let the body, which will return to nothing, be satisfied I won't search any longer beyond the sea Something shining will always be by me Because I've found it within myself

      One of the few things that gets hackles up is when some one tell me not too do some thing with out first asking why I do some thing, exp when I have been told to do that exact same thing by some one else. It just eriks me, and exp when I am at work and cant just blow off the steam by doing some thing else.   it just seems weird that I seem to go though a few stages when I get mad its like a chemical imbalance happens or some thing, I guess that's why I don't like to get mad.   first stage,  Upset.  second stage,  angst  third stage,  depression  fourth  stage, with drawl  fifth stage, ambivalence   these are the only few I can recognize that happen with in the first few hours, but who knows what else may be there as well.

      So I ran into the strainge thing the other day. Prison pen pals, who knew? There is a site that is called the pampered prisoner? What the hell, I thought these guys weren't supposed to be pampered, I thought that was the point of being in jail, though I do have to admit that there are probable a lot of guys in there that shouldn't be. Jail should be for people who harm/could harm others or them self. Yeah I do admit that people like from Enron should be in there, that stuff did harm people because low income family's suffered and such, but people (sorry to use this as in example) Martha Stewart shouldn't be in jail, so she sold stock when she shouldn't have. So what take that a way and fine her heavily.
