       Hey,    Welcome to my home, my place, my version of   Heaven   &   Hell   smashed into one world. Being my first entry i guess i should introduce myself.    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------   One advantage of talking to yourself is at least you know somebody is listening...   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     Name:  Laura      Age:  14       DOB:  November 15, 1989      Status:  Happily Taken... I Love You, Adam      Belief:  There is no God.      Religion:  Athiest (at the moment)      F  a  v  o  r  i  t  e  s  ;       Animal:  Horse (those who know me, know I am i a horse fanatic)      Music:  Hip Hop      Song:  Lil' Flip featuring Lea; Sunshine      Scent:  Bath and Body Works; Sweet Pea, Tommy Hilfinger; Tommy Girl      Poem:  Daydream;    Whenever I day dream,   and day dream I do,   in my secret garden,   I day dream of you.      I day dream of you,   in a faraway land;   embracing me tight   and holding my hand.      Holding my hand,   and touching my face.   Just you and me,   in this peaceful place.      In this peaceful place   a pristine river flows.   Where the unicorns run,   a breeze always blows.      A breeze always blows   and sings of a song;   our love in a place   where you're never gone.      Where you're never gone   is as it would seem,   from dusk until dawn,   whenever I day dream.      And whenever I day dream,   and day dream I do,   in my secret garden,   I day dream of you.     Quotes:  "As a well spent day brings happy sleep, so life well used brings happy death." -Leonardo DaVinci    "Duct tape is like the force. It has a light side, a dark side, and it holds the universe together." -Oprah Winfrey   "A pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty." -Sir Winston Churchill    "Dream as if you'll live forever...live as if you'll die today." -James Dean   "Help control the stupid people population by having your stupid person spayed or neutered" -Joni Mayhan(my mom)     Sayings:      -Anyone can give up, its the easiest thing in the world to do. But to hold it together when everyone else would understand if you fell apart, thats true strength.-A wise person speaks because he has something to say.    -A fool speaks because he has to say something.    -A closed mouth gathers no foot.   -The real art of conversation is not only to say the right thing at the right time, but also to leave unsaid the wrong thing at the tempting moment.    -Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world.   -There are three kinds of people in this world: those who make things happen, those who watch things happen, and those who wonder what happened.   -Eagles may soar, but weasels don't get sucked into jet engines.    -Gravity is an unforgiving motherfucker.    -Make it idiot proof, and someone will make a better idiot.    -Some people are only alive because it is illegal to kill them.       ok, well i think thats enough about me....i'm gonna go...     -   t     h     e      d    i    v    i   n   e
