             Today is the day we recognize the ultimate sacrifice that our Sons of Liberty have paid. From the greens of Lexington to the streets of Falujah, our citizen soldiers continue to lay down their lives for our liberty.  Freedom is never free, it can only be paid by willing blood. It must be purchased daily, and we miss a payment at the peril of our destruction.  The Navy has a habit of naming ships after battles so we never forget. Here is but a sample:  Lexington, Antiham, Belleau Wood. Iwo Jima, Chosin, Hue City. Coral Sea, Lake Erie, Vella Gulf. Vincennes, Bunker Hill, Normandy. Chancellorsville, Anzio, Yorktown.  If your American History did not cover these battles, please Google them to find out about these battles so that these men and women can continue to live on in our memories.  As I write this, tears stream down my cheeks for those who didn't come home. An unabashed love for my brother and sister soldiers, sailors and Marines, I am not ashamed to admit to these tears. I shed these tokens of love for those who went before and after me because nothing else I could give would have as much meaning.  As you place flags on the graves of these fallen heroes, remember that there is no gravestone for those who died at sea, for that is where they are buried.  Let us never forget their sacrifice, their blood spilt so that, "...the government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth."

      So, last week County Mayor AC Wharton unveiled his  urlLink "doomsday budget"  to the County Commission. It purports to use draconian cuts in the Sheriff's office, the Health Department and other areas to balance revenues without a property tax increase. Everyone is shocked, shocked! It's a horrible, unthinkable option.  It's hogwash.  Wharton proposed a budget with a 23 cent property tax increase that otherwise held the line. Seventeen cents of that increase went solely to retiring County debt. He's got $1.6 billion in debt to pay and not enough money coming in to meet the payments. Commission head Cleo Kirk shot that budget down on final approach. Reason? None of the County Commissioners want back-to-back tax increases on their heads when they go to face the voters.  So, in retaliation Wharton thumps them with this budget, his variant of the same "Armageddon" budget that State House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh and former Governor Don Sundquist tried to frighten voters with. Just as Naifeh & Sundquist knew their budget stood no chance of passage, Wharton knows no sane Commissioner will vote for his.  It's a tactic to bully the Commission into accepting his first budget. That's all. He's just stirring folks up to get the Commissioners to yield.  Watching television and newspapers taking this seriously is hilarious. They really should know better! It's all a ploy, a show, a low-stakes gamble.  Remember, AC Wharton is a lawyer by training and profession. This kind of brinksmanship is what they do. Someone will blink and the previous budget, or something remarkably like it, will magically appear and pass with much talk from everyone -- Commissioners, Mayor, newspapers, etc. -- that is was the right thing to do, that they avoided the horrible, horrible possibility of Armageddon.  Wharton will be laughing his ass off.

      Having late last year encouraged Ralph Nader  not  to seek their nomination for president, now the Green Party is  urlLink courting him  again. Guys, you made your bed, now go to sleep. It's also funny to note that when googling for this bit, all three sponsored links on the Google page were from "Stop Nader" groups. Gotta love it.

      This info has been out for a while, but it resurfaces every now and again just to let you know you're not alone anymore.  urlLink U.S. agencies collect, examine personal data on Americans .  This article talks about the data mining efforts in the public sector to get a read on who you are and try and predict what you're going to do. The GAO surveyed 128 federal departments and agencies and found that 52 are using, or planning to implement, 199 data-mining programs, with 131 already operational.   The Education, Defense, Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, Health and Human Services, Interior, Labor, Justice, and Treasury departments are among those that use the contentious new technology to detect criminal or terrorist activity; manage human resources; gauge scientific research; detect fraud, waste and abuse; and monitor tax compliance.    Most of this data is purchased from private sector companies who are already doing their own data-mining on you already.  So, any time you pay by any method other than cash, you leave a trail of what, where and when you purchased something. This can be easily researched into your shopping patterns, predicting what and where you'll buy things, where you travel, anything you want to know about yourself.  Citi Bank's ad about "we'll detect suspicious spending and stop it" just shows you that you're being constantly monitored.  So, just remember all of this the next time you whip out that credit card.  And for the record, I DO NOT wear silly little tinfoil hats. Mine are made of titanium.

      A co-worker of mine just forwarded a message that must be making the e-mail rounds. This piece of political spam is titled "Twenty One Beliefs of A Good Republican." I decided to amend this with twenty-one beliefs of a good Democrat. Below is the original with each number followed by my version:  1. Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Rodham-Clinton.   1. Jesus loves you, as long as you keep him a secret and abandon your faith once you pass through the door of the school, court, or federal office building. And because Jesus loves everyone, you shouldn’t be against any sin, even murder and theft.   2. The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U. N. resolutions against Iraq.   2. The United States is a democratic republic that should be ordered around by communist China and theocratic dictatorships at the UN. Our highest national priority is gay marriage.   3. "Standing Tall for America" means firing your workers and moving their jobs to India.   3. “Standing Tall for America” means the government telling companies how to run their business.   4. A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind, without regulation.   4. A woman has every right to murder her baby in private, that’s her choice, but the government should run all other private affairs.   5. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness and you need our prayers for your recovery.   5. Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime only if you are Rush Limbaugh, and your drugs are prescribed legally by a doctor.   6. The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.   6. The best way to improve military morale is to slash the DOD budget of all advanced weapons systems, vehicles, aircraft and programs used to defend the country and protect the troops. You should also send troops to Somalia on peace-keeping missions where they are dragged through the streets, bomb Baghdad unilaterally and invade Bosnia without UN approval.   7. Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins unless you someday run for governor of California as a Republican.   7. Group sex and drug use are degenerate sins only if you are Arnold Schwarzenegger, even if the alleged 20-year old sins are charged by anonymous sources in a newspaper days before the election after being held back for multiple weeks. Those things are completely fine if you someday run for governor of Arkansas as a Democrat.   8. If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.   8. If we get out of Iraq and leave Saddam in power, terrorists won't want to kill us anymore.   9. A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.   9. A good way to fight terrorism is to ignore it.   10. HMOs and insurance companies have the interest of the public at heart.   10. The federal government has your interest at heart.   11. Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.   11. Universal health care is a constitutional right, and if we have to destroy America to get there, so be it.   12. Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.   12. Tobacco should be illegal, but we should legalize marijuana. Unproven scientific theories should not be taught in school, except for the big bang, evolution and global warming.   13. It is okay that the Bush family has done $millions of business with the Bin Laden family.   13. It is okay that Bill Clinton refused to take custody of Bin Laden when offered on a silver platter.   14. Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.   14. Saddam was a bad guy when Reagan armed him, a good guy when Bush’s daddy made war on him, a bad guy when Cheney did business with him and a good guy after Bush put a democracy in place of the Taliban.   15. A president lying about an extramarital affair is an impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.   15. A president lying under oath is no big deal. A president offering supported, sourced evidence for a war against a brutal dictator who had ties to terrorism and was hiding illegal weapons programs, including nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, is an impeachable offense.   16. Government should be limited to the powers named in the Constitution, except where it prevents them from banning gay marriages, censoring the Internet, or locking people up without due process because of their ethnic background.   16. Government should read rights into the constitution, including gay marriage, abortion and the removal of any reference to God. The number one priority in the war on terror is to protect the civil rights of terrorists.   17. The public has a right to know about Hillary Rodham-Clinton's cattle trades, but George Bush's Harken Oil stock trade are none of our business.   17. The public shouldn’t know the true story about John Kerry’s medals and how many times he’s changed his story, but by all means let’s demand more of George Bush’s 30-year old dental records.   18. You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have a right to adopt.   18. You do not support states’ rights, unless it’s gay marriage or legalizing marijuana. You certainly don’t support Alaska’s right to drill for oil.   19. What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the '80s is irrelevant.   19. Bill Clinton’s sworn testimony about what did in the oval office is irrelevant, but what Bush did long before he held any office whatsoever is of vital national interest.   20. Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.   20. Free trade with any country is wrong if that means jobs might be created outside of Detroit.   21. Affirmative action is wrong for others but it is ok for your father and his friends to get you into Yale, the Texas Air National Guard, Harvard Business School, part ownership of Harken Oil, part ownership of the Texas Rangers, the Governorship of Texas, and then have the Supreme Court appoint you President of the USA.   21. Government-sponsored racism is fine and dandy, as long as it discriminates against white males only. Election officials in Florida should have re-examined ballots again and again until enough chads fell that they could divine voter intent and appoint Gore President of the USA, even though every recount total there was in Bush’s favor and another Bush was reelected as Governor there two years later.

      Well, I'm afraid it's bad news for Air America fans here in the Mid-South. It seems that  urlLink WMQM  will not be carrying their programming after all.  If you go to  urlLink Air America.com , you can see that they still list WMQM as "Coming Soon!" But I made a call to station manager David Brown and got the real story. He noted that the  Commercial Appeal  had also  urlLink covered  this story about three Saturdays ago, but let's be honest...how many of you read the Saturday  CA ?  Brown said that he had been contacted about 2 months ago by someone from AirAmerica. They had all of a five minute conversation and Brown never agreed to anything. Next thing he knows, it's been announced at Air America. He's tried to get them to pull the station's call letters from the list, but so far AA hasn't done anything.  Mr. Brown wasn't opposed to carrying the programming, but he didn't have the daytime space to run the minimum 6 hours required. If anything, he would have run it after midnight, but that was unacceptable to AA. Brown mentioned he's received about 50 calls from various folks wanting to know when AA is coming.  He did mention two rumors he's heard. One is that another station here in Memphis may pick it up. He felt that there was enough of a potential market for the network to succeed. Brown also said he'd heard that Al Franken's contract only runs through December. Depending on the national elections, and his own success or (so-far) failure, I don't think it's impossible that Franken may decide to just cut and run.  So, sorry all you Memphis libs and Dems. Better luck next time.

      good question, Tom.  here's why:  1. because in November 2000 the communist sympathizers in the media decided to paint the Bush states red and the Gore states blue, even though the reverse is more historically accurate, in order to confuse the electorate.  2. because Tennessee is Bush Country (a red state) even though Al Gore is our "favorite son."  3. because of the Memphis Redbirds  4. because we are conservatives who presumably support the Bush administration, at least to the extent that we wouldn't vote for the other guy

      I found this political cartoon by Paul Nowak on  urlLink RightToons . I wish I could copy it for you, but it's got a copyright stuck on it so I can't even link to it. So, I'll have to describe it to you.  On the left, there is a news anchor pulling his hair out, screaming, "NOTHING is worth stomping on prisoners toes just to get some information!! That's INHUMAN!!" On the right side of the panel, it shows the second plane about to smash into the WTC South Tower, with "Thanks. We'll keep that in mind." over it.  Never mind that there was some famous Lefty who came out in an NYT Op-Ed in favor of torturing of terrorists.  I don't know what we were doing as far as torture, but I do know what we weren't doing:    Chopping hands off  Chopping feet off  Chopping heads off  Throwing people off three story buildings  Electrifying men's genitals  Raping daughters while their parents watched  Giving people acid baths...   Need I go on?  We need to keep things in perspective. While what we did was wrong, it was but a shadow of what was done before us. We are bringing the appropriate people to justice and that should be the end of it, if the media ever lets it go. But of course, as long as it can damage Bush, they won't.

      The world of politics is a strange place. I just so happen to agree with this op-ed piece in the San Francisco Gate,  urlLink A law too far .  Like most Clinton-era "important" laws, it values spin and feel-goodness over practicality and Constitutionality. It made the President look good that he was "doing something," when all he was doing was creating another photo-op for himself. It was no surprise to me when it was overturned, because like other famous laws under his administration, it was poorly written and a bad law to begin with.  I don't like all of the porn on the internet. There's too much of it, especially in the deviant category. No longer is our porn hidden in back rooms, behind the counter or in "specialty shops." Our kids can get to porn as easily as they can get to Nickelodeon.  And yet, as with most important things, there is no easy fix. Any strategy that the porn pages can come up with to separate the kids from the adults will not stop the determined adolescent. Internet filters will always be too loose or too tight. The best way to keep kids away from that stuff is to spend time with them. Supervise their internet usage, take the time to talk to them about porn, and visit websites before the kids do.  I say that last part because even the most innocuous web page can contain porn. I went looking for the Pink Palace web page (a museum here in Memphis) one day and I picked the obvious page, www.pinkpalace.com. Nope, that wasn't it by a long shot. The correct web page is www.memphismuseums.org.  Remember, time with your kids is the best defense against porn.

      I forgot to mention this earlier, but there was a party in Nashville over the weekend that was a reunion of the folks who stopped the State income tax. Speakers included US Representative Marsha Blackburn, radio hosts Steve Gill and Phil Valentine, and more.   The Tennessean's  Tim Chavez  urlLink wrote a look back  at the "horn honkers."   Certainly, the horn-honkers were not known for their etiquette or their adherence to Robert's Rules of Order in expressing their feelings. But they were the ones first wronged. They were lied to by their representatives who pushed a state income tax. So they didn't leave feelings unhurt or ears unassaulted.  While I did not agree back then with the protesters about the income tax, I could not fault their ire. And I could understand their frustration in watching legislative leaders like House Speaker Jimmy Naifeh use any trick possible in trying to pass the income tax. Representative government became an oxymoron. That's wrong, regardless the issue.  No matter how much some Tennesseans despised them — particularly those in the media and political establishments who didn't care for mere mortals challenging their judgment — the horn-honkers represented Tennessee at its roots. And they weren't all from Williamson County trying to avoid paying their fair share. I was out there, and I also saw blue-collar folks.  I was one of them! My buddy Phil and I went to Nashville in May of 2002. It was the first day of the vote, which Naifeh changed at the last minute. We walked around the crowd, watched the amusement of the legislative workers and talked to folks from all over. I had a blast and everyone had a real sense of making the legislators pay attention.  Read Chavez' article. He talks alot about the disdain of the government and media types for us back then. Remember, it was the newspapers who coined the term "horn honkers." It was meant to insult and demean.  And we never needed that income tax. Right now, just two years later, the State is running a $277 million (and climbing!) tax revenue surplus. We could get a cut in that exorbitant sales tax, if we just started  urlLink honking  again.  Think about it.

      Over at the  urlLink Nashville Files  blog, Blake reprints the transcript of a 911 call from a woman who can't defend herself  and her children  from an armed intruder.  The message is clear, but let me add that we as a culture need to get back to teaching self-reliance, self-protection and preparedness. We should also reinforce healthy skepticism and wariness, even though it might damage a consumer culture built on feelings of inadequacy, impulse and helplessness. Fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, schools, churches, etc., should be working to raise strong, smart women who aren't inclined to bad choices and who can take care of themselves in a pinch. Anything less is asking for trouble.  No woman should find herself where this poor woman did. Those who do should know how to take care of themselves -- and their attacker.  We should live in a world where, as the song says, "A girl in trouble is a temporary thing."

      Let a politician become comfortable and sometimes they'll open their mouths and  urlLink speak the truth  to you.   Headlining an appearance with other Democratic women senators on behalf of Sen. Barbara Boxer, who is up for re-election this year, Hillary Clinton told several hundred supporters -- some of whom had ponied up as much as $10,000 to attend -- to expect to lose some of the tax cuts passed by President Bush if Democrats win the White House and control of Congress.  "Many of you are well enough off that ... the tax cuts may have helped you," Sen. Clinton said. "We're saying that for America to get back on track, we're probably going to cut that short and not give it to you. We're going to take things away from you on behalf of the common good."  I can only hope that they caught her on tape. What a campaign ad that would make.

Liberals can't follow the law they wrote, so they have to cheat to raise money. 24 of the top 25 donors are donating to Liberal 527's. Of course, these groups are supposed to be independent from any political campaign, but big groups like ACT are staffed with former Kerry staffers who still have ties to the campaign.

      I meant to pass  urlLink this link  along a while back, like last week or so, but it got lost in the daily press. Thanks to  urlLink South Knox Bubba  for first posting about it.  This is Senator and former Vice-Presidential candidate Joe Lieberman speaking:   Today I want to discuss the war we are waging against Islamic terrorists in Iraq and around the world, and to argue that it is fundamentally a war of ideas and a war of values, a war of conflicting visions of humans and history, of faith and country.   The war on terrorism we are fighting goes to the very heart of America's national purpose and national security.  Our core principles of freedom and opportunity are at stake.   In the flurry of news bombarding us each day of the ups and downs from all fronts in the war on terrorism, it is easy to forget the larger ideals that it is all about.  Car bombings in Baghdad… pipeline attacks in Riyadh… assassination attempts in Islamabad… foiled terrorist plots in Thailand… victories in Afghanistan… arrests in Columbus, Ohio… may cause people to lose sight of the values we are fighting for in this war – and the values we are fighting against.  We cannot let that happen.  A democracy such as ours can only go to war and win with the informed support of the people.    The terrorists can never defeat us militarily.  But they can divide us and defeat us politically if the American people become disappointed and disengaged, because they don't appreciate and support the overriding principles that require us to take military action.  The same, of course, is true for our allies in Europe, Asia and throughout the Muslim world.  They need to better understand and embrace our purpose and what it means for them.  What we are fighting for in Iraq and around the world is freedom.  What we are fighting against is an Islamic terrorist totalitarian movement which is as dire a threat to individual liberty as the fascist and communist totalitarian threats we faced and defeated were in the last century.  Holy crap! No wonder you didn't hear a peep from the news media about this speech. It's the wrong message for Democrats to be sending right now. Read the whole damn thing.  It's clear-eyed, eloquent, realistic and hopeful. It's unquestionably Wilsonian. Lieberman reminds us of our history and purpose, the history of Islamic terrorism, paints the war on terror in large clear terms, and calls for a Middle Eastern Marshall Plan. From the mouth of any Republican or neocon, it wouldn't seem at all odd, but from a Democrat in the current atmosphere it's a surprising call to action.

      Somewhere down below is my post called "A Carefully Constructed Lie." It was a look at an article written for the Shelby County Democratic Party newspaper, the  Democrat , scaring people over a supposed coming military draft.  Well, the story took an unexpected turn late last week. Out of nowhere, I found that substantial parts of the story had appeared elsewhere under another person's name! I looked into this, including talking with the  Democrat  article writer -- a professor at Christian Bros.  Read the tale for yourself and you decide. It's at the top of  urlLink Half-Bakered  this morning.

      First, do nothing.   Next, get handed a newsworthy intelligence document that has been in circulation for two months. Sit on the story for "several weeks" while you conduct multiple interviews to "determine that the government considered it authentic."  A week later, publish a  urlLink sensational article  about another document (on the same subject) handed to you by a commission's staff members, without obtaining confirmation from the actual commission members. Be sure to give it an " urlLink anti-Bush spin ," and leave out any reference to the document you received last week.  Two days later, say that the report contradicts statements made by the President and his administration, only to  urlLink reverse  yourself the day after that.  Discover that commission members " urlLink do not get involved in staff reports ." Face the inevitable  urlLink reproach  from the commission panelists, and  urlLink another  from the Vice President.  A week later, when you eventually do publish  urlLink an article  on the first story, describe it as a "newly disclosed document."  Finally, leave your readers (and critics) asking, " urlLink And who knows what else the Times is not telling us? "  Rinse. Lather. Repeat.

      I found this article,  urlLink Gore Accuses Bush of Lying About Saddam/Al Qaeda Tie  and thought it was more of the same. Blah, blah, blah.  But as I scanned through it, I happened upon the last paragraph, which caused me to sit up and almost fall over (my chair being broken.  urlLink Please Donate! ). Here it is: In anticipation of Gore's speech, the Republican National Committee on Thursday circulated an "Anger Management" brief, quoting various Washington insiders who recently described Gore as  "out of control," in need of psychiatric help , "in full hatred mode" and unstatesmanlike. [Emphasis mine] You don't say things like this about people like this unless it's serious. While it's been said more than once that my Conservatism stems from my mental illness, I would not say the other way around. I for one hope it's not so, but you have to admit he has been acting a lot out of character lately.

      At the last TFA meeting we heard from  urlLink Kemp Conrad , chairman of the  urlLink Shelby County GOP . What follows is the result of a few hastily scribbled notes combined with content from the web site: The Republicans Party of Shelby County maintains a  urlLink headquarters  all the time. The Democrat counterpart only opens one during campaign season -- after elections they close up shop.  There are  urlLink 61 members  on the steering committee. Terms expire every two years so there is ample opportunity to get involved at a high level in the county organization. The steering committee meets on the first Thursday of every month at the headquarters on Parkplace and Ridgeway at 7:00 (p.m. one would hope, although I neglected to ask). There are  urlLink four standing committees  (although I count five on the website):  Grassroots: "Campaign groundwork, organization, and volunteer recruitment." Outreach: "Bringing in new people to the party with a special focus on minority communities." Finance: "Fundraising for party operations and special projects." Candidate Recruitement: "Recruiting the best and brightest candidates for public office and making endorsement recommendations to the full Steering Committee." Bylaws (not mentioned by Kemp): "Reviews and recommends changes to Party Bylaws." Astoundingly, there are  urlLink 11 Republican clubs  in Shelby County to meet the need of just about everyone:   urlLink Collierville Republican Club  (they are looking for a webmaster).  urlLink East Shelby Republican Club  Bartlett/Northeast Shelby Republican Club (does not meet during the summer) Southeast Shelby Republican Club  urlLink Lunch Hour Republicans  (see you there!) Republican Career Women Rhodes College Republicans  urlLink Shelby County Republican Women   urlLink Shelby County Young Republicans  (for those between 18 and 40, although they'll take your money even if you're over 40)  urlLink Tri-County Republican Women   urlLink University of Memphis College Republicans  (the website seems woefully out of date -- maybe they are studying too hard to be tomorrow's leaders) The GOP has every county office except Mayor and Assessor, although they hope to win back Assessor this year. Another important race is General Sessions Court Clerk, for which Chris Turner is challenging incumbent Roscoe Dixon [an ex-state senator with high name recognition in the community so this one will be tough].

      At the last  urlLink TFA  meeting we heard from Jeff Ward from  urlLink Team GOP  Tennessee . He is  urlLink one of the principles  of a grassroots effort to get Republicans elected to every level of office throughout Tennessee. They are starting by  urlLink specifically targeting  vulnerable Democrats in the Tennessee House in 2004, with a goal of spending $100K in key state races this year and possibly gaining a Republican majority. I don't know if TeamGOP knows it, but they are implementing the same strategy as the highly successful  urlLink Club for Growth , only at the state level. Is this possible? I believe so as there are a number of House Democrats that are vulnerable and that I would like to see Team GOP  go after, including (but certainly not limited to):  Speaker  urlLink Jimmy Naifeh  (aka, Mr. "we gotta have an income tax"). Naifeh did pretty poorly against write-in opponent Antonio Lopez two years ago. He then spent a lot of political capital in his nearly successful bid to ram an income tax down the throats of an unwilling citizenry, and is paying the price as supporters have distanced themselves from the aura of failure.  urlLink Dr. Jesse Cannon  has been essentially campaigning for the last two years for this seat. He is well known in the community and has a lot of support (as well as a tiny bit of money from me). Naifeh is going down, and this is the year we knock him off his perch. Freshman  urlLink Kent Coleman  won his seat by  38 votes , in part because of an A rating from the NRA based on how he answered a questionnaire. Once seated on the misnamed Constitutional Protections subcommittee, Coleman reversed his position and voted against initiatives he specifically pledged to support during the campaign (thus giving rise to the word " urlLink Coleism "). Coleman angered a lot of gun owners in Tennessee and we hope to make his political career a very,  very  short one.  urlLink Craig Fitzhugh   urlLink Phillip Pinion   urlLink Tommy Head   urlLink Rob Briley  While Team GOP  is concentrating on the House, there are a few vulnerable Democrats in the Senate as well:   urlLink Tommy Kilby   urlLink Roy Herron   urlLink John Wilder  (who is also Lt. Governor).  Cross posted at  urlLink Volitics

      ACT, Americans Coming Together, a notorious pro-Kerry 527, has hired people with felony criminal records to go out and register voters.  urlLink Felons Paid in Voter Registration Drive   Their motives are certainly noble, giving these ex-felons a second chance and all, but it just goes against common sense to allow felons to possess someone else's private information. It's nice to see a kid voluntarily swear off candy, but you don't take them into a candy store to get some of your own.  Sex offenders are included within this group of felons. This is what makes my blood run cold. Sex offenders have a 90% recidivism rate because their criminal behavior is hard-wired into them. How would you like to let someone like this know you have children?  It seems the Left has no qualms about who is chooses to be its representatives.

      So, Moore's film,  Flabbythighs 451 lbs.  is going to open and the debate is on. I've seen some folks try to compare him to Leni Reifenstahl as a film-maker -- great fims in the service of evil -- but I think a more  apropos  comparison would be to Ed Wood: earnest incompetence elevated by a cult of worshippers.  Let's looks at them. Both have a serious fashion fetish. Wood was well-known for his love of angorra sweaters and cross-dressing. Moore has a thing for ballcaps and dressing like he's still a working class slob. Problem is, Moore lives in Upper West Side New York, in a very expensive condo, and hobnobs with the folks in Cannes and Hollywood.  And then there's the Reifenstahl comparison.  Triumph of the Will  is masterful film-making. The film's most ardent critics, those who abhor the Hitlerism she gloried, admit that it is compelling and stirring cinema. You can't not watch. You get sucked into it and are repeatedly shocked when you realise you are finding yourself admiring the Nazis. Her conclusion may be revolting (Hitler is a god among men.), but her construction of the argument is flawless.  Moore? Not so much. His films are riddled with errors and sloppiness. Just like Wood's. His arguments are no more convincing than the pie plate UFOs Ed Wood hung from string before his camera. Wood's films bore the marks of his alcoholism; Moore's, the jitteriness of a caffeine and attention addict.   Bowling for Columbine  and  Farenheit 911  are like  Triumph of the Will ? No, they are more like  Glen or Glenda  and  Plan Nine From Outer Space . An obscure failure in his own life, it was only with death and time that Wood gained his notoriety. Moore is celebrated today, but I think the next generation will regard him just as sadly and peculiarly as we do Wood today.

      I have a post over at my blog titled, "A Carefully Constructed Lie." It's way too long to post here, so I'm directing folks to  urlLink Half-Bakered  instead.  The local Democratic Party paper,  The Democrat , has an article written by its editor, Roger Easson a professor at Christian Brothers University, that is shameless propaganda trying to make people think the draft is coming with Bush's re-election. I've been following this issue and there are some puzzling things, but Easson runs with this like its a secret plan by the neocons to dragoon legions of American youth into Richard Perle's plan for world domination. It's an artfully constructed mix of truth, lies and misdirection.

      There are   six   Republican candidates for TN House District 83 running in the primary. The crowded field is due to RINO Joe Kent deciding to retire. Joe Kent is a long-time incumbent, so why is he calling it quits? IMHO it is because  urlLink Chuck Bates  gave him a run for his money two years ago and Joe knows he wouldn't win this time because Chuck is letting people know about his RINO voting record (like his  urlLink vote for an income tax ). Chuck has essentially been campaigning for two years now but he faces a lot of competition. All six candidates spoke at the  urlLink Lunch Hour Republicans  meeting on Thursday and I took some rather hurried and incomplete notes, which I have detailed below. But first:  AlphaPatriot Analysis:  Pat Collins seems like a nice guy and I'd like to have him as a neighbor, but not as a rep -- not ever. Stan Peppenhorst was unimpressive. Mark White seemed competent but overly focused on small business. Brian Kelsey was OK but didn't appear to have solid solutions. Charles McDonald gave an unimpressive presentation but did well in follow-up questions (which I did not even attempt to transcribe because each candidate's answer was so brief -- except for McDonald, who appeared capable of talking all day if you let him). Chuck Bates had the best list of talking points but didn't propose solid answers (then again, neither did anybody).  AlphaPatriot Pick: Chuck Bates  I don't  know  that I would have picked Chuck if my only contact was from this lunch, although it seems extremely likely. He had a good grasp of the range of problems facing this state. His only problem is that he didn't project well (being in radio that is understandable -- you can't do that in front of a microphone). In addition, I've known Chuck for several years. I supported him in his campaign two years ago in which he almost unseated an incumbent because he worked really, really hard to do so. I've heard Chuck talk about his political views and theories (can you say " urlLink confrontational politics "?) and his values. I personally know how hard he works and how passionate he is about the issues. He will make a fine public servant.  urlLink Brian Kelsey , lawyer.  Worked in the White House Counsel’s Office during the first Bush's administration and also worked in the offices of Senator Frist, Senator Thompson and Congressman Bryant. He touted the idea of bringing an attitude of service to the office, the fact that he brings political experience and the ability to build coalitions. Talking points:   Taxes:  We are overtaxed and yet the state is running a surplus. These funds should be refunded to the taxpayers.  Education:  Need to prioritize funding and direct it to the teachers and classrooms, not administration and waste.  Jobs:  Need to bring jobs to the state. One way to do this is to continue to fix things like workman's comp.   Stan Peppenhorst, educator for 33 years and active in protecting neighborhoods. Talking points:   Education:  Train and reskill workers in Tennessee reeducation centers.  Families  are important  Perseverance:  Quoted Edison as saying, "We haven't failed. We've tried a thousand things that haven't worked so we are that much closer." [ urlLink Actual quote  is "I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work." but you get the gist.]  Experience:  Said that he served on several state committees. If you stress education then technology and jobs won't leave the state.    urlLink Chuck Bates , Executive Vice-President of Information Radio Network Served in the first Bush White House in the Office of Political Affairs. Talking points:   Experience:  Strong background in finance and economy.  Taxes  are the number one issue. $277 billion surplus over the last ten months.  Jobs:  Tennessee is not a "business-friendly" environment  TennCare:  $167 billion this year for TennCare, and is projected to take 90% of the budget in ten years.  Qualities:  Common sense and leadership are needed in Nashville  Tort reform:  Losers of frivolous lawsuits should pay the costs of bringing the suit.   Pat Collins Talking points:   Healthcare  for senior citizens and everyone else (facts missed due to FedEx flight overhead)  Taxes:  Back bill brought up by Bryson [no doubt a reference to the  urlLink Taxpayer Bill of Rights ]  Education:  Needs fixing  Crime:  Needs money to stop crime  Patience:  There is no quick fix  Dedication:  Collins is retired so he can dedicate 24 x 7 x 365 to the job   Mark White, Educator and businessman Talking points:   Communication:  All the candidates have a vision, we need someone who can communicate it.  Experience:  54 years old and taught for 30 years. Was a teacher, principal, child support counselor, and then [I think] provided counseling services as part of a private business startup.  Taxes:  Held up a TN tax form that his business must fill out and explained how it has become and how a $3,500 new tax just showed up one year.  The economy runs on the backs of small business 60% of people employed are employees of small businesses   Observable:  We need people who know small business needs and can catch things like new hidden taxes   Charles McDonald, Lawyer for 15 years Talking points:   Waste:  Held up Commercial Appeal and pointed to article about nine new schools were "thrown up", were over budget and now are developing cracks [ urlLink actual article  details that costs were $135/sq. ft -- twice that of original estimates -- and that Germanshire Elementary, built on portions of an old lake bed, is sinking. The school board faced time constraints to meet state class size mandates, hence the hurry.]  MLGW:  Pointed to the photo on  urlLink another CA article  and said that the new head of the MLGW looks just like the Mayor. Mayor Herenton might as well take over and draw two salaries.  Press:  Pointed to a  urlLink CA editorial  which says that the MLGW decision has been made and it is time to "move on". The CA does not back up the people.  Qualities:  We need a fighter, not someone who needs to be liked  Cross posted at  urlLink TennWatch  (aka  urlLink Volitics )

      Blogger Bill, posting as INDC, has a  urlLink great entry  where he went to an anti-war demonstration to interview Michael Berg, the father of executed kidnappee Nick Berg. Berg  pere  is decidedly on the Left, the Marxist Left, and says a lot of revealing things to Bill.   Socialist Workers newspaper? (Enthusiastically) Oh, yeah , oh yeah, oh yeah … (gives info) my e-mail is the best way to contact, because my wife probably will slam down the phone on just about anyone who calls; she’s still in a very emotional state. My son was a member of the Socialist Workers Party, yes he was, my son David, not my son Nick, my older son David. I supported his efforts working with the Socialist Workers Party, and I went with him to the headquarters in NY and I attended the rallies and I supported his trips to Cuba and … I don’t really want to say (gestures to me) because he’s (got a tape recorder).  There's a lot more and it's all worthwhile as a view into the folks who are really behind the anti-war movement, the ones who organise and promote and ensure media access. It's not pretty and neither is it American.

      I usually don't do my thinking on the blog. I prefer to have the idea fully formed before I post. But this one I want to get out there right away, before it slips out of the queue of my mind and I lose it altogether.  The phrase "liberal media" is pretty much common currency today, except for a whole swathe of the left in the major media who just don't believe that it fits them. And there's really no reverse phrase in common use like "conservative media," though you can point to quite a few outlets that fit.  There are bloggers like the guys at  urlLink LeanLeft  who don't believe in a liberal media. They argue it's a construct of a group of conservatives looking for scapegoats for their own biases. Whatever.  So, I propose the phrase "partisan media." It's a value-neutral expression. It can be applied without political baggage. You need only demonstrate that some column, article or story isn't neutral, fair and objective. In other words, it's a way to point out the failures of journalists without forcing them to confront political affiliations or agendas. You concentrate on the problem -- inaccurate, biased reporting -- without providing the cover of political spin.  I need to work on the idea some more, but I hope I've conveyed the main idea. My biggest concern is that "partisan" comes with some Progressive "To the barriades!" baggage of its own.

      The story has already disappeared from the evening news and the daily papers, one of many such stories that just keep coming. So, I'm posting a link to the  urlLink Robert Jacob assassination  to keep the story fresh. We're still hearing about Abu Ghraib, and now the ancillary stories of "hidden" prisoners. It's all about how the military and our government are doing evil things and we should do something about it. Doesn't matter that the government is doing something, and some parts of these stories are months old and already addressed. Too bad Robert Jacob doesn't get that treatment.  The video is mostly propaganda wrapper around some short, shaky scenes of Jacob's gunfire murder. It's a reminder: We try to fight "fair." We abhor those who don't. We uncover and punish those who don't. We try to do the right thing.  Our enemies, and never forget that's what they are, don't. Plain and simple. Don't.  But if you watch the evening news and cable news, read the national papers, you don't always get that message clearly.  Watch the Jacobs video again. Get the message. Clearly.

      Like I said, just because President Reagan is in the ground, does not mean the flood of people paying their respects will stop. Two stories support that:  urlLink Reagan's Death Boosts Tourism in Ill.  and  urlLink Reagan Library opens with extended hours .  July 4th marks the end of the official mourning period, but the crowds and the lines will continue past that date. The visitors will come by the droves every June 5th for years to come as well. You took him too soon, God. We hardly knew him. But now thousands will come and learn more about him than what the Liberal Media wants you to know about him.  urlLink Leftist Media Bias - Even in Death  provides a good example: Before the body of Ronald Reagan had been flown to Washington, D.C., or his eulogies intoned, "objective" so-called reporters such as Tom Brokaw of NBC, Peter Jennings of ABC and Dan Rather of CBS (see www.ratherbiased.com) revealed not only their transparent biases but also their shabby characters.  Brokaw, as always, tried to have it both ways, giving cursory lip service to Reagan's legacy (yes, Virginia, some presidents actually have a legacy!) but patronizingly reminding his audience that his "obligation" was to "put [the president's] whole life and political career in context." Translation: to engage in leftist revisionist history. So sad. Talk about kicking a man when he is down, kicking his body after he is dead is heinous.

      The radical eco-terrorists known as the Earth Liberation Front (ELF, or 'Elves' for short) are in the news on a regular basis out west. They love to burn housing developments, and burn or deface SUV's.  urlLink Radical Environmentalists Take Aim at Suburbia .  They have stopped spiking trees and crawled out of the forest to wreak their twisted views on suburbia. While no one has gotten killed to date (at least they care, rather than P E T A) someone will eventually.  Here's the payoff paragraph: And when large-scale arson attacks make the nightly news, the general public tends to lump all the environmentalists together instead of separating the mainstream groups from the radicals, McInnis said. "This only hurts the message that legitimate environmental groups are trying to put forward."  In other words, the ELF's are hurting more than they are helping. Maybe one day they will realize that.

      Blogger ate an earlier draft of this post, and I won't try to rewrite it. I mostly just wanted to pass along  urlLink this link . I've phased out my reading of the New York Times, but I happened to catch this article which probes the Red vs. Blue idea: myth or reality?  On the myth side we have the fact that several of the "bluest" states elected Republican governors (plus one governator; while the reverse is true for Tennessee).  On the reality side is some polling data that suggests we're becoming more fundamentally partisan.  I think it's a little of both - we are becoming more of a divided nation, but maybe that disparity is more evident because of a lack of great leadership on both sides. To that end, I enjoy this quote: A senior strategist for the Bush campaign, Matthew Dowd, does not believe that anyone can overcome the partisan divide this year. Noting that Democrats gave overwhelmingly negative ratings to Mr. Bush the year before the Iraq war, he said: "A portion of the Democratic electorate doesn't like Bush no matter he does. I wonder if they'd be supporting the Iraq war if Clinton were conducting it. But when it comes to Bush, they've made up their minds." If either party had more larger-than-life candidates, it probably wouldn't be an issue. California is a testament to that, as was Giuliani's New York and Reagan's 49-state landslide.

      In a weekend email exchange with my good friend Craig Cantoni, we talked about the absence of people who truly stand for reducing the size of government. Here's part of the exchange:    Me:   Overly simplistic question: to your knowledge is there anyone on the national scene that runs and gets reelected based upon a near revolutionary stance on shrinking government?    Craig:   Great question.  If anyone has, it would be Ron Paul of Texas.  I've read some of his speeches and writing, but can't recall him saying it.  I don't think anyone can be elected by saying that, as the public likes big government -- orr I should say, has been indoctrinated to like it.  Milton Friedman had an op-ed in the yesterday's WSJ praising Ronald Reagan for reducing the growth in the number of pages in the Federal Register.  He included a graph showing that before Reagan took office, the pages had peaked at 82 pages annualy.  After he took office, the pages dropped to 45 per year and then grew back to 80.  Of course, 45 pages of new regs a year still adds up to a lot of regs.  All Reagan could do is slow the growth, not stop it or reverse it.  If one of the most popular presidents couldn't do it, nobody can.

      I found this article,  urlLink Waves of Mourners Honor Reagan in D.C. , and it got me thinking.  One week is not enough to say goodbye to such a man. Thousands (tens, maybe even hundreds of thousands) more will file past his grave for several weeks, if not months after his burial today.  Circumstances prevent me from personally saying goodbye to President Reagan, and I hope the entries here and at  urlLink The Conservative Zone  have provided a good enough replacement for my absence.  Goodbye, Mr. Reagan.

      This article,  urlLink Controversial Pass Lets Kids Into R-Rated Films  offers a way to parents to totally vacate their responsibilities.  This, of course, is not good. While this same movie shows up later at Blockbuster, and then on the TV at home (albeit "sanitized," but still with warnings) these do not decrease the responsibility of the parents to provide a moral context of the movie, even if no permission is granted.  I don't understand being too lazy to be in your child's life, especially at an age where they are making decisions of their own and you need to be there to make sure they are making the right decision for the right reasons. This is the age where decisions made will stick with them for years to come. It is a parents duty to be there for the kids.  But instead we give them a fist full of money, or a debit card and say, "Get whatever you want."  No wonder we have such a hedonistic and amoral generation today.

      As I mentioned in a post down below, I grew up in Huntsville, Alabama. Huntsville is a small town but it somehow got both Redstone Arsenal, a substantial military base, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, which was one of the three legs of America's space program (with Houston and Cape Kennedy/Canaveral). MSFC was the home of the German rocket scientists, Wernher Von Braun, et al. Growing up in the Sixties and Seventies, we always knew that we were sitting right next to a first or second strike nuclear target if a shooting war broke out between America and the Soviet Union.  Reread that last sentence. If you are my age or older, it sounds like a kind of nostalgia to talk about it. If you are younger, it sounds alien. Words and phrases like "Soviet" and "nuclear target" and "first strike" are from some other time and place. No one thinks like that any more.  You can thank Ronald Reagan for that. Because of his vision and determination, the Soviet Union was destroyed and the threat of nuclear war is a distant one, for now. He had the strength of character and the persuasion of belief to carry this country to his goal. We went from a bi-polar world of Mutually Assured Destruction (another archaic term now) and five minute warnings to the uni-polar world of American victory.  For people who didn't live through the time, to always know in the back of your mind that any international blunder could mean nuclear annihilation for you must seem strange. It's similar to the fear of a terrorist attack today, but worse, because nuclear war meant the end of everything. We in Huntsville would be the lucky dead; the survivors would live in desolation. It was a time of television programs like  "The Day After,"  about the aftermath of a quick war, which was one of the highest rated programs ever. It's not even much recalled any more.  You would be in the middle of your day and something on the news would kick the flame of fear from a low flicker to a guttering fire. You could actually joke with girls about wanting to do it at least once before we all died. Alarm sirens always stabbed your heart. You stopped for a beat, listening and worrying. "Is this it?"  We don't have that any more and you can thank Ronald Reagan for that. All the media blather this week makes it sound like Reagan was universally loved in America. That's not true at all. During his two terms he was as vilified as any President of the twentieth century. Much as George Bush is today, the elites of New York and Washington and their peers in Europe thought Reagan a reckless madman who was bringing on death and war. He was stumbling -- because he was incapable of the level of thought necessary to understand -- across decades of diplomacy.  The anti-nuclear campaigns of the time firmly believed, at the tops of their shrill and hysteric voices or in earnest condescending tones, we needed to just sit down with the Soviets and negotiate away whatever we had to so that the Soviets wouldn't attack us. Nuclear weapons were a threat, not a deterrent. From the day of Reagan's election, they warned that we were on the edge of nuclear war. The  urlLink Bulletin of Atomic Scientists  had a "doomsday clock" (yet another archaic term) that was set some minutes to midnite, showing how little time we had, how close the threat of all-out war (another archaic term) was.  How many of you today have even heard of this clock? How many of you haven't heard about it in a long time? You can thank Ronald Reagan for that.  It's no surprise that so much of today's Leftist rhetoric resembles the Sixties protest movement. The relics of that era moved on to the anti-nuclear campaigns in the Seventies and Eighties, picking up new recruits. Reagan ended that whole movement, stranding them, until the Gulf War and then the War on Terror came along. Some of us see the War on Terror, against the fascists and terrorists of radical Islam, akin to the Cold War. There is an enemy of American that doesn't seek co-existence but defeat. There are no peace talks that will save us; no treaties that will stop them. We face an ideology that warps the lives of tens of millions even as it kills millions of its own people. The faces may change, but the task is always the same.  So, some of us see that Reagan was right to dedicate America to the fight against our greatest enemy. It's for our safety and for the freedom of the oppressed. Bringing freedom and liberty to the people of the Arab world will make our world better too.  America was given a great gift from the philosophers of the English Empire, France and Germany. We were conceived in liberty and grew to a strength unknown anywhere in the world. It has been our Great Commission to bring that gift to every corner of the world, to spread democratic republican government.  Ronald Reagan understood that with a clarity unmatched. He believed it with an ardor that literally redrew the map of the world. He gave half a continent freedom and opportunity.  Now that responsibility falls to us. We must bring freedom and opportunity to the Middle East. Reagan always knew that people are good, but our leaders can be bad. It's the same for Arabs, Turks, Persians, et al. They are not bad people, just laboring under a bad ideology imposed by bad leaders. Give them the gift of freedom and they will flower just as Eastern Europe is.  You can thank Ronald Reagan for that.

      Just to show you how twisted Liberal thinking is, I offer you this example,  urlLink Reagan Made This Young Lefty See The Right .  Here's the payoff: ...One day, the professor decided to give virtually every student a failing grade.   Why? I'd worked hard on a paper detailing how our consumerist culture negated the gifts of females and nonwhites, taking care to omit the pronoun "he" from each sentence. But the professor was disappointed because, during a group project — something about the rape mentality behind rock music — two students became too busy or lazy to participate in this important work.   The no-show students were granted "A"s. Then the professor laid a tear-inducing guilt trip on the rest of the class, declaring that those who actually did the work had clearly failed to bring our recalcitrant sisters into the fold.   It taught me an important lesson, but hardly the one the professor intended.  How screwed up in your Marxist thinking do you have to be in order to perform such an act? Fail everybody BUT the failures, then lay the blame on those that did the work? If that's Liberalism, I  really  don't want it now. Personally, I don't think that professor could find his ass with both hands and a flashlight.  The author continues: When he became president, Reagan represented everything I viewed with suspicion. Optimism. Patriotism. Personal responsibility. But as his presidency progressed, so did my journey toward the political middle. Reagan taught future generations of lefties not to expect the government to solve all problems.   Good job.  See? People can grow and mature. All it takes is a little push sometimes.

      I just saw this little item at  urlLink The Corner : "On the way into work this morning, a 30-something radio D.J. opined that President Reagan was the reason that many of us grew up as conservatives. I know that's true of me. I didn't understand all of the policies and arguments, but I knew that if a conservative is what Ronald Reagan was, then I wanted to be that, too.   One day when I, too, 'slip the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God,' I plan to give a warm hug to President Ronald Wilson Reagan. I will tell him, 'Christ changed my heart, but you changed my mind.'   -W. A. Davis, Memphis, Tenn."

      You know, I collect the little one line quips of wisdom of humor that you see on things like bumper stickers. It's certainly cheaper than collecting stamps or cars.  I thought I would share with you some quips of President Reagan. "We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free."  "No arsenal or no weapon in the arsenals of the world is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women."  "Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it."  "The most terrifying words in the English language are: I'm from the government and I'm here to help."  (I think the most uplifting words I could ever hear are: "I'm a United States Solder, and I'm here to take you home.")  "How do you tell a Communist? Well, it's someone who reads Marx and Lenin. And how do you tell an anti-Communist? It's someone who understands Marx and Lenin."  "History teaches that war begins when governments believe the price of aggression is cheap."   May history never forget these witticisms.

      It's a shame to make my inaugural entry one of political disgust, but that's what the  urlLink Treasurer of the Democratic National Committee  and  urlLink another liberal  brought to mind this morning. To "free themselves" from the weight of the 60th anniversary of D-Day and the death of the President who won the Cold War so that they could launch the mean-spirited, win-at-any-cost venom so fast on Monday morning...well, it's just wrong.  Thanks for letting me join you here. I look forward to developing many close associations.  Have a great week!

      Several items in Sunday's  Commercial Appeal , but none quite merit a post of their own, so we practice thrift and combine them here.  First is Wendi Thomas' regular  urlLink Sunday column . Talking about the renomination of Joseph Lee, Memphis Finance and Administration director, for President of MLG&W, she writes the following:   In March, Herenton reluctantly agreed to look nationally. The search charade included ads in four newspapers and on a couple of Web sites - but apparently not one industry publication....  "I intend to vote for a nominee who is qualified and has utility experience," says council member Carol Chumney, who prompted the city to advertise on the American Public Power Association's Web site, the only industry ad the city placed.  Was any of this, y'know,  reported  anywhere in the  CA ? Why does it remain for a columnist to reveal this to Memphis?  This is precisely the kind of important information that a paper is supposed to provide to a community. It demonstrates quality of character about Herenton, and sheds revealing light on the nomination of Lee. It is the essence of news! How long has the paper had this information? What else does it know and not report? Do any of the television news stations also know this?  Thomas also passes along as received wisdom this bit:   Since Herenton has decreed he was appointed mayor not by voters, but by God, it follows that if Lee's appointment is the will of Herenton, it is thereby the will of God. Right?  As a middle-class white guy, I tread lightly here, into questions of race and culture. I'm also no fan of King Willie Herenton. But. I listened to his Prayer Breakfast talk (courtesy of the  Commercial Appeal's  belated but laudable posting of an MP3 version to their website) and I didn't take that impression away from what he said. It sounded very much to these ears like the standard "all thanks go to God" comments you frequently hear from African-Americans who receive some honor. Herenton was doing the same, as I heard it, but it comes filtered through his enormous self-confidence and his public aura as arrogant.  Back to the  Commercial Appeal . Tom Walter  urlLink finally  gets around to noting Joey Sulipeck's rise to FOX13 chief meteorologist. (Third item down.) Unfortunately, it's in a short item buried in the "Region in brief" column in the Metro section! Well, you saw it  here  first! Advantage: Half-Bakered, with enormous and invaluable assists from  urlLink Peg  and  urlLink SouthTVNews . Yay team!  And finally, there are  urlLink these tidbit  from the main editorial in Sunday's paper, "Challenges loom for public schools."    Despite efforts to revitalize downtown Memphis and revamp inner-city neighborhoods, outmigration and the urban sprawl it creates continue to drive up the cost of Shelby County services - education and all the rest - with no end in sight.  There has been little actual growth to pay for the costs associated with the urban-to-suburban population shift in Shelby County. That burden has created inescapable budget cuts for a variety of public services, including education.  So, the  Commercial Appeal  wants you to believe that all that work and revamping going on downtown is to "lure" people back to the City? Hogwash. It's about lining the pockets of a few people, plain and simple. A mere 10,000 folks live in the whole of the downtown, versus how many hundred thousands elsewhere? A wise city wouldn't have drained important resources into "Manhattan on the Mississippi," but would have husbanded them and spread them out.  It would also have tackled the pre-eminent reason so many folks are bugging out from Memphis, a reason the Chris Peck-era  CA  is loathe to admit: race. The utter and dismal failure of City schools to provide even a minimally acceptable education to its students is widely (correctly or not) seen as a failure of African-American politicians, educators and adminsitrators. Deal with it. If the folks who spearhead all these downtown initiatives and commissions and corporations and tiger teams would put that kind of drive, energy, commitment and refusal to lose into our City schools, it would go an amazing distance to slowing, if not reversing, "outmigration." I will say that new Supt. Carol Johnson seems to be fighting the good fight, with scant attention to the details in the  CA . She deserves her own "tiger team" of city leaders who will move heaven and earth to make her reforms happen. Where are they?  Will that happen? Not any time soon. A select circle of people still haven't made enough money from you yet.  And the truth is that even black Memphis realises what a loss the present City schools are. Look at all the new majority black, and "urban appeal" developments springing up out in the County. As more and more black Memphians prosper and get the means, they too are voting with their feet and getting the hell out. That't actually a refutation of race in a way, and a confirmation that the schools are a deciding factor.  Deeper into the editorial comes this:   Nothing short of a building moratorium is likely to affect that situation, and prospects for halting the outmigration with a moratorium are slim. Neither the Shelby County Commission nor the Memphis City Council has shown an inclination to put serious obstacles in the way of developers and new home buyers.  This is, in a word, suicidal. Once the City and County put down serious brakes on building, it will spell long-term and deeply serious trauma for us. Just putting these ideas out as a legitimate option is affecting things.  If a moratorium comes, the first thing that happens is a skyrocket rise in home prices for those properties under construction but not yet sold. The supply for these houses will suddenly be severely limited, but the market demand will remain. That's elementary economics.  Also, if Memphians who want out -- for good schools, racism, safe neighborhoods, whatever -- know that Shelby County is now, or will soon be, a closed book, then they just skip county or state lines and move anyway. But now they'd be out of the reach of Shelby County altogether.  One thing I'd be interested to know is, since the County Mayor announced an intention to impose a moratorium, whether new home permits have spiked? I'd guess yes. Getting all those permits in now will give builders a lucrative market of homes for when the moratorium comes and artificially limits the pool of new housing stock.  Doing what Mayor Wharton plans is, in the face of an ongoing and steady outflow of people, crippling to the remaining citizens of Shelby County. Until the school system and the crime problems are dealt with to a degreee that reassures folks, they're going. What Wharton wants to do will just assure that we lose them altogether.  And it will also mean the imposition of some kind of payroll tax. Government leaders, and their cheering section in the press, will argue that we must "retrieve" monies "lost" to folks who work or shop here but live away. Or new fees on new development. You watch. Politicians who will not do what must be done will take the easy way out. Problems will not be adequately addressed, so the long and unstoppable arm of government taxation wll make up for their inadequacies. We will all continue to pay and pay and pay....  Lastly, the editorial concludes with this:   That debt burden has put the county commission in the position of deciding between another property tax increase for fiscal 2005 or drastic reductions in county services.  County Commissioner Marilyn Loeffel was on Sunday's news saying she thinks it will end up being between those two options. That's what I said yesterday. The County Mayor will accept some cuts, which magically won't be so wounding for important County duties like police, and we'll see an 18 to 20 cent tax rise.  Remember where you read this first.

      Alrighty then, it's time to see where we stand. I haven't seen any new comments or suggestions in the past few days, so the bloggers bash is set for June 16, Wednesday, at 6:30PM, at the Blue Monkey. I've heard directly from about six people, and will assume that about another 6 or 8 will attend based on previous statements. Ideally, it would be great to see almost all of Memphis' blogging community -- both professional and amateur -- attend. That's more than two dozen!  So, I will swing by Blue Monkey and see if they can handle us, and then set up a reservation. Or would someone more familiar with the staff like to volunteer? Does anyone need special accomodations we should take care of?  Please post a note on your own blogs to get the word out. If you know someone who blogs that isn't known in general, please tell them. I'll send a message to the Rocky Top Brigade through their mailing list, and send emails to the Memphis bloggers I'm aware of.  The last one was tremendous fun and not at all rancorous. Political discussion, which didn't predominate at all, was always civil, if sometimes forceful. (Mike looks meaningfully at Tom G. Just kidding.) Come and put some faces to those pixels.

      The  Commercial Appeal  is  urlLink reporting  today that County Mayor AC Wharton nixed the release of a letter to County employees warning them of a coming mass layoff.  This came after some flurries of activity on Thursday. One of his department chiefs sent a letter to the County Commissioners warning them of the upcoming letter. Commission head Cleo Kirk immediately fired back a warning letter about premature action before Commission hearings had even begun! That's when Wharton pulled his letter.  AC is upping the ante here, adding to the pressure on the Commission to accept his original budget proposal, the one with the 23 cent property tax hike. Judging by their actions and words so far, the Commissioners seem to be reacting to Wharton, and not leading or directing him. It's not a good sign for those of us who oppose governmental growth in general.  This afternoon, I managed to get through on the Andrew Clark, Sr. radio show on WREC AM600 and talk with him. Clark seems to be of the opinion that Wharton is sincere and not using some kind of fakery or plotting. We had a longish conversation on it, but he seems unmoved.  I'm still saying it. The County Commission will eventually buckle and give in to a tax increase, maybe only 20 cents instead of the requested 23. There will be only cosmetic "cuts" if there are any at all. Everyone will end up pointing fingers at everyone else, but the stark fact of a tax increase will remain. And no other media source in Memphis will tell you the truth of this.

      It continues to amaze me that the local news programs and the two main papers are still taking seriously County Mayor AC Wharton's "doomsday" budget. How anyone can think he'd honestly propose cutting the sheriff's budget by seventeen percent, eliminate the Metro Drug squad and other anti-crime programs, and cut back on mosquito and rat control is beyond me.  Step back a moment. Look at what he's doing. Wouldn't that, under  any other circumstance  be considered bizarre political suicide? Wouldn't the public boggle and the news have a field day questioning the sanity of anyone in elected office who proposed it? If the papers printed a story from some other community where this was happening, wouldn't we wonder what kind of idiots they were?  So why isn't that happening here? The  Memphis Flyer  stepped up with an  urlLink editorial  that seems almost credulous.   Just now, Shelby County government is the test case. Budget deliberations by that body in the next several weeks will determine whether draconian cuts will need to be made in most, if not all, county agencies. Sheriff Mark Luttrell, whose public style is refreshingly open, recently embarked on a public-relations mission of sorts in which he made the case to various media outlets, including the Flyer, that the law enforcement arm of his department would be endangered if he were forced to enact cuts of the magnitude that have been suggested.  Mayor A C Wharton, whose trial balloon for a significant property tax increase (most of it merely to pay for debt service) was shot down in mid-air some weeks back, has responded to the county commission's reluctance by proposing a moratorium on new home construction. At first blush, this appears to be a negotiating tactic. But maybe not.  Maybe the mayor is merely enunciating what the sheriff and other department heads will soon, for better or for worse, have to reckon with. In the vernacular: You get what you pay for.  The  Commercial Appeal , perhaps smelling the rat,  urlLink hasn't weighed in yet . Or maybe they're waiting for Sunday? We'll soon see.  The television news programs, of course, are having a field day. Last night, WMC breathlessly ran a story about  urlLink rats , and how County budget cuts will mean rats overrunning the city. They even had lots of video of rats! EEEE!  [Digression: Speaking of rats, Councillor Carol Chumney was part of that video report. She's been making herself really, really available to the local news and so is showing up on television a lot. Of course, this makes her look "involved" and "concerned" and gives folks the impression that she's "doing something about the problem." Sigh.... Do we really want someone so nakedly and desperately ambitious as Mayor? Or as District Five's representative?]  Anyway, no one yet is calling this spade a spade. Wharton threw a challenge back to the County Commission. His "doomsday" budget is a sham. Rather than do the politically difficult work of crafting real cuts in the County's budget, they'll cave in a couple of weeks and simply revert back to Wharton's original budget. And they'll cravenly blame Wharton, saying they "couldn't" vote for his "doomsday" budget. And  we'll  get stuck with the 23 cent property tax increase absent any meaningful spending changes by the County.  You watch.

      I wrote the entry "Arnie is a RINO" just below. Mick Comments: Mark, I sense you're entering the dangerous territory where we argue that freedom be measured out only to those who will not abuse it. Your thoughts? I think this deserves it's own entry rather than a comment back.  I am against almost any kind of gun control. I am for restriction of guns to those who present a clear danger with firearms, such as those with a felony record and those with mental problems, even though I am in the latter category.  I am against the laws of California with their draconian efforts to ban 'evil' semi-automatic weapons.  I am for normal citizens the ability to carry weapons wherever they go in the course of their lives, so that they have the legal ability to defend themselves and their families. I am for giving medals to the citizens who kill criminals in the commission of crimes. I am for the mounting of said dead criminals head on a pike in public to serve as a warning to others.  But LA County is facing a worse problem than the Marines in Fallujah. The cops and citizens of LA are facing a ruthless enemy. At least the insurgents are facing a nominally occupying army. These gangs have no restraint against using violence, in fact it is usually their first option. The over 600 deaths a year is telling us that the gangs are recruiting faster than they are killing each other off.  These gangs are going after the cops, which says that the regular citizen does not stand much of a chance. The ruthlessness of these gangs tell me that if you piss one of them off, you can expect to see that gang around your house at 3am with a Molotov cocktail in one hand and a gun in the other.   If these gangs were granted access to semi-automatic rifles, the present bloodbath would turn into a massacre. Cops, citizens and rival gang members would be mowed down with impunity. Cops ballistic vests can't stop a 7.62x39 round, so any gang member hunting cops would turn first to such a weapon.  There is no easy answer. You could criminalize gang tattoos and dress, but the gangs can change methods faster than lawmakers can outlaw it. You could pick up everybody with gang tats and just dump them on an island off the coast, but the 9th Circus would say no to that.  You could create a police state, but that wouldn't fly around here. You can't change the culture they come from, because the gangs are after power and prestige and money. LA has it's own version of the Bogota cocaine cartels.  The only way to get the gangs out of LA is by cauterization. Arm the cops and citizens to the teeth and put a bounty on every gang members head, dead instead of dead or alive. You must make the entire city too dangerous for the criminals to exist and they won't. But I promise you it will never happen. The bloodbath will only get worse.  The cops are not equipped, nor are they meant for such a role as wiping out the gangs. It will take military force to get rid of the gangs, just like in Iraq.  Sure. Repeal the California AW ban. I'm all for repealing the law. Evil exists only where good allows it to. Maybe the citizens will take up arms against the gangs. That is certainly what I hope will happen. Maybe I'll sprout wings and fly. In either case, the good citizens of LA will get exactly what they want. Either they are willing to fight for their safety or they don't mind the sound of gunfire in their neighborhoods.

      Well, well, well. Arnie is for renewing the Assault Weapons Ban. Even when I reported  urlLink here at The Zone  that even anti-gun groups were leaning away from renewal.  The bad news is I can see his point of view. This article,  urlLink LA 'on the road to Falluja'?  talks about the skyrocketing murder rate in LA, caused by the gangs. I have no idea what percentage of LA murders are caused by semi-automatic rifle fire, but considering that attacks against the police are on the rise, I think the gang members wouldn't mind the extra firepower.  While Krazyfornia might be draconian with its gun laws, I see no reason why those laws should extend beyond their borders.  I always said when they created California, they tilted the country and everything loose rolled there. My 2 years stationed in San Diego confirmed that.

      I saw  The Day After Tomorrow , the day before yesterday.  As I note at fishkite.com, President Blake (the movie character, not  urlLink this guy ) looks like  Earth in the Balance  author Al Gore (see the  urlLink side-by-side photos ). Really, how could you make a political, environmental disaster movie without tipping your hat to the former VP? In this film, Gore plays the part of the bizarro-world President, who somehow delegates the signing of Kyoto to his unlikely, evil-conservative successor.  It's a silly scenario ( no kidding, in this movie? - Ed. ), but that mixed-up casting allows a sympathy-earning Gore to dispose of himself quickly, leaving the Cheney character to take full blame for America's failed policy. In the final minutes of the film, liberal moviegoers get to cheer and salivate over two juicy moments - the ironic, illegal crossing of Americans into Mexico and a speech by Cheney where he apologizes to America and the world for ignoring "science."  First, about that ironic crossing into Mexico. In the movie, Americans who illegally cross the border are allowed to stay in refugee camps, in exchange for the U.S. government erasing their debt. In theatres across the country, this plot turn is celebrated.  urlLink Rich Lowry  asks, Why are audience members so gleeful to see the US brought low, to see us escaping to Mexico, to see us need aid from other countries? Some people laughed so hard at those scenes (as well as the ones with the VP) I think they were trying to let those around them know they got the "joke" or "irony" or whatever it was supposed to be... Are they totally ignorant of how much aid the US has supplied to much of the world for years? Indeed, the US is the most generous country on earth. I've written about that  urlLink before , and  urlLink here's some of the data . But there's another aspect here - the Bush amnesty plan. President Bush wants to allow illegal immigrants to stay in this country, in exchange for NOTHING, other than letting us know they're here. So how is this tragedy something America deserves?  As for the Presidential apology - your $7 gives you what Mr. Bush would not give journalists during a recent press conference. I'm sure that one scene is worth it for some folks. But, honestly, do we really want it to come to this? Should the President of the United States worry about crafting policy around wild "scientific" theory, especially one that is crafted by - ahem - rather  urlLink strange fellows : Streiber is best known for his autobiographical accounts of the numerous occasions in which he's been abducted by aliens, and most of Art Bell's listenership consists of people who think giant black triangles are hovering over their houses. To drive this point home, the scientific foundation behind the movie's plot wasn't written by scientists but rather " urlLink active alien and UFO theorists " who obviously "didn't run any computer models of the atmosphere to verify their theories." On top of that, by one account, the film was even  urlLink disavowed  by Bell and Streiber.  That's pretty sad, but it gets worse. According to  urlLink this guy  and  urlLink this guy , among others, there are many, many problems with the "science" presented by the film. For example, "all three laws of thermodynamics" would need to be repealed for some of the film's destructive phenomena to actually take place.  But, you ask, why waste so much time picking apart such an " urlLink absurd ," " urlLink profoundly silly " movie? I do it for several reasons, and "for fun" is not the least of them, because I agree with Ebert that this movie is fun. I also do it because of the movie's potential for use as propaganda, as  urlLink Chilson  notes. Other reasons may include - because it's an easy target, because I actually saw it, because that's the type of fleeting garbage bloggers write about.  A final reason is this - creator Roland Emmerich has done a disservice to the environmental cause: The Day After Tomorrow has  urlLink zero educational value . The film blows every opportunity for explaining global warming science in a credible way. Rather, every such opportunity deteriorates into a mindless "action" sequence. There are plenty of thoughtful people who are on the fence when it comes to environmental issues and they aren't likely to be swayed by such an approach. You might scare children and ignorant adults, but I'm not sure that's the best audience to convince if you really want to make a difference.  Emmerich  urlLink says , "People are smart enough to know this is a movie, and in a movie everything is more extreme."  However, it seems Emmerich has succeeded in fooling himself; "Like many other people, I have this feeling that we're slowly but surely destroying our planet," he said. "I came [to this issue] because of science fiction, and then I realized it wasn't at all science fiction but something that is very real."  Emmerich tells  urlLink Scifi.com : I kind of discovered this book, The Coming of the Global Superstorm, written by these science-fiction guys [Art Bell and Whitley Streiber], and ... I ... first saw it totally as science fiction. But then I realized from researching it, ... how much was real science. And that, like, immediately made me want to do this movie. And then I ... said, 'Let's use all the strengths, like the strongest aspects, of my movies to sell this to the audience.' Because I felt compelled to sell this to the audience. Yes, people know it is just a movie, but it's being sold as "real science."

      Yesterday afternoon, the truly execrable Mike Phlegming had County Sheriff Mark Luttrell on his radio show to discuss County Mayor AC Wharton's "doomsday" budget. Luttrell was remarkably calm about it, and really gave the sense (though not the admission) that he's in on the bluff. He deferred politely to the Mayor's decision and kept telling listeners that it was to be expected when there would be no tax increase.  It only reinforces my belief that this is nothing but a lawyer's tactic to get the County Commission to acquiesce to the Mayor's original budget with the 23 cent tax increase. You keep watching.  As for Phlegming, he was his typical annoying self. At one point, Mike asked Luttrell a question about something "his sources" had told him about: a two page memo about some internal County decisions leading up to the budget. (I'm going from memory, so I may have that a bit wrong.) You could tell that Mike was trying to trap Luttrell into something without spilling beans over the air. Nothing was revealed except that Fleming knows things you don't and wants you to know it. Yet more of Fleming's grandstanding and using his radio show to do the business of (unknown) others for unknown reasons.  All the more reason to listen to Andrew Clark, Sr., on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, or WDIA several times a day!

      At The Daily Standard,  urlLink Mark Continelli  makes a persuasive case that independent candidate Ralph Nader, shibboleth of the "Anyone but Bush" crowd, is doing pretty darn well. I would remind readers that Nader is still polling a pretty steady 6% -- well above his pace in 2000. And that's with the Dems and their friends in the media working against him!  Over on the Libertarian side, it's not looking so good. The party chose  urlLink Mike Badnarik  in a surprise over the two leading candidates. Badnarik  urlLink isn't looking  like an especially strong or appealing candidate.  urlLink Chris  over at  Signifying Nothing  weighs in with some insights and links.  On Neal Boortz yesterday, he mentioned that during a lull in the convention proceedings on C-SPAN over the weekend, the LP used the opportunity to speak directly with America about who we are and what we offer, to present a film about an American who moved to Canada to grow medical marijuana! Real good PR job, nutwads. I really wish someone would take over the remains of the Reform Party, which may be hijacked by Nader to bolster his ballot access, and infuse it with libertarian values without the purist / absolutist nonsense. Stress individual rights, property rights, reduced government and market it to the voters. Let the Libertarians have the purism and in a few years the relaunched Reform can absorb them the same way the Democrats did with the Socialists some decades ago.  Lastly, things still don't go well for Kerry, despite what the press and media make you think. Look at  urlLink this poll  and  urlLink this one . You'll see that while GW Bush's numbers move up and down, Kerry's have yet to rise above the mid-40's. He is in a  quagmire ! No matter Kerry's speeches or Bush's "failures" in Iraq, Kerry is treading water and  still  not gaining traction. Iraq just successfully installed their provisional government. Bill Clinton's book is coming out soon and will overshadow Kerry, sucking air from his candidacy's mediasphere. Then comes the handover of power in Iraq. Then the conventions, which may get the least amount of network coverage yet from the Big Four.  Reason to hope, for conservative types.

      The graphics bug hit me again, and so we have the  urlLink Why We Fight  page, a collection of graphics to remind us in the starkest of terms why we are in the War on Terror. Some of the images are not for the squeamish.   UPDATE:   There was a typo in the HTML that caused some image problems. I think they're fixed now. If you are having java problems with the pop-up large images, let me know in the comments. There  should  be a narrow equal-width border around the image inside  pop-up box. Plus, I added another image, bringing the total to six.

      I wanted to ask something to the rest of you on MRB about purpose and direction.  Is part of being "Memphis" Redblogs to look at the local scene and offer viewpoint and comment on the politics and culture, the roblems and opportunities, of Memphis? Or are we mostly a collection of folks who live in Memphis who are conservative voices talking about whatever?  I'm not suggesting an either/or thing here! But I was kinda hoping for more of a direction to blogging about  Memphis . Let's face it, there's not much in the way of conservative point of view in the Memphis media and print outlets!  I was talking with someone last night and moaning about how there aren't that many bloggers in Memphis (although it's growing), and how so few of those bloggers turn their attention to Memphis and Shelby County. I'd love to see more local comment, as a parallel track of information to the local mainstream media.  Anyway, y'all's thoughts?

      I don't like abortions. Not at all. It kills what is at least a potential child.  I hate abortions, because a large part of them are post-coital birth control by women who don't bother to use any kind of birth control in the first place.  An abortion affects a woman for the rest of her life. She will look at a child and think, " You know, that child is just about how old my child would have been if I didn't abort it. "  That being said, I am very reluctantly for abortion, because it is the women's right to choose. No matter how much I don't like it, it is the law of the land.  But PBAs (Partial Birth Abortions) go too far. It comes down to partially removing a  viable    fetus and killing it. If the doctor makes a mistake and lets it all the way out, the fetus becomes a live baby. This must stop. And it has, by law.  But then you get this ditzy bitch,  urlLink Judge Blocks Partial-Birth Abortion Ban . A Clinton appointee, Phyllis Hamilton is committed to legislating from the bench instead of interpreting the Constitution. She is most likely pro-abortion in all of its forms (why else would Clinton have appointed her) and any law that disagrees with her opinion must be unconstitutional.  This woman and all of her ilk must be stopped.

      I'm afraid that even Republicans have fallen prey to Democrats rhetoric.  urlLink GOP Takes Off Gloves in Bout of Budget Infighting .  The GOP has lost sight that tax cuts increase, not decrease, tax revenues. It happened in the 60's under JFK, it happened in the 80's under Reagan and it's happening today under Bush.  The problem is we are staggering under a massive social program load. Over half of the Federal budget is transfer payments from one person to another. Welfare, Food Stamps, farm subsidies, Medicaid/Medicare, Social Security, and so on. What is the waste is only 26 cents on the dollar actually make it into the pockets of the people it's supposed to go to. Social programs like these is one of the reasons that brought down Rome.  Between the rising costs of such programs and the cost of running a war, of course we will have a deficit. But now that employment is going up, production is up, housing is up, we will start to increase tax revenues as well. Federal tax collections will soon start to swell. You just have to give it some more time. It's only been a couple of months that the "jobless" recovery started showing job growth. Once those people get to work things will change.

      This article,  urlLink A Few Questions for the Presidential Candidates , asks some good, hard questions of both Bush and Kerry.  Here's a question for President Bush: In the 2000 campaign, you clearly stated that you believed the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill was unconstitutional, saying, "I think it does restrict free speech for individuals." As president, you signed that very bill into law. You took an oath of office to "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States." Did you sign a law you believed to be unconstitutional, violating your oath of office? Please explain this reversal. The questions are just as hard on Kerry: Referring to Republicans’ push for pro-life judges on the federal bench, you lamented, "the systematic targeting of any judicial nominee who does not meet the rigid requirements of litmus tests imposed …"   But according to The Associated Press, you said in a speech last January, "If you believe that choice is a constitutional right, and I do, and if you believe that Roe v. Wade is the embodiment of that right ... I will not appoint a justice to the Supreme Court of the United States who will undo that."  Isn’t that a litmus test? Or does the phrase "litmus test" only apply to opponents of abortion? These questions will never be asked of these men, or at least they won't be asked of Kerry, but nevertheless they are excellent questions that deserve direct answers.

      Michael Moore bellows again. "The right wing is not where America is at," Moore said. "Most Americans, in their heart, are liberal and progressive. It's just a small minority of people who hate. They hate. They exist in the politics of hate."  "They're not patriots," Moore said. "They're hate-triots, and they believe in the politics of hate-triotism. Hate-triotism is where they stand, and patriotism is where real Americans stand."  [...]  "I mean, they are up at six in the morning trying to figure out which minority group they're going to screw today," Moore continued. "The hate, they eat for breakfast. They are going to fight and they are going to smear, and they are going to lie, and they are going to hate." This just goes to show how looney this guy is. I invite all of our readers to visit all of our blogs and try to find one example of "hate-triotism" in what we have written.  Sure, I talk about the hate of the Democrats. But that is backed up with fact. There is a clear double standard with them. Case in point, Sandy Burglar.   The Bush administration has been taking months to make sure the case against him is warranted and is air tight. You just don't 'accidentaly' take multiple classified documents and pages of notes home with you (some in your pants), then 'accidentaly' destroy some of them. He did this not once, but several times.  But let's face it, if that would have been Condi Rice stuffing classified notes into her stockings, her head would have rolled by now. Democrats that are taking Burglar at his word would be screaming 'national security breach' and be demanding her head and other miscellaneous body parts.  They are the hate-triots.

      Michael Moore plans to crash the Democrat Convention.  urlLink Fahrenheit 7/26: Michael Moore: I will crash Kerry's party .  This will be wonderful. Kerry is trying to appeal to the uncommitted middle of the country, and the loony far-left is bounding up saying, "I want to help!" This is akin to the Vietnam movie where the newbie doesn't watch where he's going and trips the booby trap, wiping out the whole squad.  This kind of help Kerry doesn't need right now. This is specifically why Moore wasn't invited to the convention. Kerry is trying to go centrist without alienating the Left, and the Left refuses to leave him to go there. As long as the vocal Looney Left is with Kerry, there is no chance for him to get any significant portion of the centrist vote. In fact, as long as the LL stays loudly vocal, it will drive the centrist vote right into the GOP camp. Perfect.

      In this article,  urlLink Scouting jetliners for new attacks  it describes how we are being set up for another attack.  And the attack will be carried off unless we get over our PC and start racial profiling the right people. Right now if there are three men of middle eastern decent about to get on a plane, only one of them can be taken aside for an in-depth interview and screening. A 33% chance is not something I would take to a casino, let alone bet my life on.  Or is it misdirection? The terrorists make these blatant moves that we react to and don't pay attention to the real plans. They actually try to carry out an attack this way, which we discover and stop, and while we're patting ourselves on the back, the real attack hits with devastating results. Man am I paranoid. Or am I?

      Today's  urlLink Peter Gammons article  on ESPN.com includes the following:     "So who puts the bug in candidates' ears about seeming what they are not? John Kerry last week professed to be a big fan of 'Manny Ortez,' then re-emphasized the phoofery by correcting it to 'David Ortez.' No, that was Dave (Baby) Cortez and 'The Happy Organ.' A few years back Kerry went on a Boston station with Eddie Andelman and said 'my favorite Red Sox player of all time is The Walking Man, Eddie Yost,' who never played for the Red Sox. Kerry is going to sweep New England. He's going to get 70 percent of the vote in Massachusetts. He doesn't have to be a Red Sox fan, all he has to do is not be John Ashcroft."   Great way to fire up your base and appeal to the common man, Johnny. Tell people your favorite Boston player is someone who never played for them, and then become a big fan of someone who doesn't exist. I assume he either meant Manny Ramirez or David Ortiz, but with this guy who knows? Who's your favorite pitcher, John? Pedro Garciaparra?

      This is sickening. The New York Times printed an  urlLink op-ed piece  on Sunday by a woman who decided to kill two of her three future babies for the sake of convenience. She did not get pregnant by accident--she and her boyfriend (not husband) decided to stop using birth control, and if they happened to get pregnant they would keep the baby. How gracious of them.   Unfortunately for them, they got pregnant and found out that there were triplets. The potential for a minor inconvenience (one baby) turned into a major inconvenience (three babies). She cites such potential travesties as having to move to Staten Island and buy large jars of mayonnaise from Costco as the justification for murdering her own offspring. Therefore, she did the only sensible thing--murder two of her own children. (pardon me while I choke on my own sarcasm)   The end is the best part--she says that the thought of becoming pregnant again is horrifying. She says she would do the same thing if it were triplets again, but if she had twins she would probably just have both of them. That would equal 3.... which is right where we started.    UPDATE:  The link above is now fixed to bypass the NYTimes login page. Thanks to Aaron Swartz for the  urlLink link generator .

      I happened across this on NewsMax:  urlLink Answering America's Critics  where Pat Boone takes a Liberal missive apart line-by-line. Here is a sample:  Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.    Remember the Ayatollah Khomaini and the American hostages he held for so long? Remember the war between Iran and Iraq? Saddam at that point was our "friend" because he was the Ayatollah's enemy, and if Reagan armed him it was in our national interest. But remember when Saddam literally kidnapped the country Kuwait? In national and humanitarian interests, President Bush severely chastised our former "friend" and restored Kuwait its freedoms, indeed, its nation. For a while afterwards, there was good reason for Americans to help Iraq rebuild and to reestablish vital connections to its oil supply, though we now knew Saddam was not our "friend". And after 9/11, with the whole world knowing that Saddam had used biological and other weapons on a half million of his own people and according to available intelligence was planning to develop nuclear capability while he played a ten year "shell game" with the UN, it made sense to take some preemptive action. Or would you rather just wait till the next 9/11 and the next? It rants on and on from there in typical Liberal fashion. Read it if you want. I suggest that you do.

      Here comes a new version of Michael Moore.  urlLink 'Outfoxed' Attempts to Show FOX News' Bias .  This compilation of FOX news clips is supposed to show how biased they are. The outrage is they are leaning toward the Right. Of course, no one would think about doing such a "documentary" on CNN, even when their bias has gotten them into trouble, such as with an anti-gun piece a while back. I remember where CNN shot a watermelon with a MAK-90 and a 30 round magazine. The bullets tore that watermelon up. Then they put in a 10 round magazine and proceeded to miss with every shot, "proving" that the rounds were less powerful. Same gun, same bullets, just less of them and they are less powerful? Give me a break. CNN had to explain and apologize for that piece after they got their hand caught in the cookie jar over it.  I'll bet you Mr. Greenwald would not be able to find any Left leaning tendencies in the ABCCBSNBCCNN networks, but that's a whole 'nother post.

      In two related stories,  urlLink Exclusive: Election Day Worries  and  urlLink Counterterrorism officials look to postpone elections , the subject has been brought up on delaying Federal elections due to terrorist threats.  First of all, there is no Constitutional provision for delaying or changing the date of elections. Second, I don't trust anybody, Democrat or Republican, with that power. If you can push it off once, you can push it off indefinitely.  I don't care if they set off a nuke in New York. I don't care if they set off a nuke in Washington D.C., the election goes on as planned, there simply is no other choice.  The quickest way for this country to become a dictatorship is for elections to be suspended. And when that happens, the terrorists will have won.

      You know, I used to use that number as a kid. "My dad makes a TRILLION dollars a year" and such. Well, Kerry being a tax and spend Liberal, wants to spend almost a trillion dollars over the next 10 years to provide most (but not all) Americans health care. Yet another step towards socialized health care.  urlLink Kerry Health Plan: Almost $1 Trillion Over Next Ten Years .  This brings up a couple of points I've been trying to work in for a while. First, out of the total amount of health care we consume in our lifetimes, half of it is consumed in the last year to 18 months of life. Second (I learned this from Glenn Beck), most socialized health care systems cut off most, if not all, health care at age 65. Which is why Canadian seniors are jumping the border to the US. They can't get it up there.  Any attempts at true socialized health care in the US will fail, simply because of the over 65 voting bloc, especially once the Baby Boomers get there. There will be no way to control the spiraling costs, and it will drag us down. We have to start pushing people away from the lifeboat, even though I'm one of them.  I require over $300 a month in medication in order to keep me from committing suicide. At least I'm in moderately good health and have no other problems. But there will come a cut off point and that will be the end of my life, one way or another.

      Over on  urlLink The Conservative Zone  yesterday I posted Red Skeltons Pledge of Allegiance and Issac Asimov's Star Spangled Banner. Today I found these words by Ronald Reagan, and I thought I would share them with you here.   Editor's note: When he was president, Ronald Reagan wrote the following piece for Independence Day in 1981. Aide Michael Deaver later wrote: "This 4th of July message is the President's own words and written initially in his own hand."   For one who was born and grew up in the small towns of the Midwest, there is a special kind of nostalgia about the Fourth of July.  I remember it as a day almost as long-anticipated as Christmas. This was helped along by the appearance in store windows of all kinds of fireworks and colorful posters advertising them with vivid pictures.  No later than the third of July - sometimes earlier - Dad would bring home what he felt he could afford to see go up in smoke and flame. We'd count and recount the number of firecrackers, display pieces and other things and go to bed determined to be up with the sun so as to offer the first, thunderous notice of the Fourth of July.  I'm afraid we didn't give too much thought to the meaning of the day. And, yes, there were tragic accidents to mar it, resulting from careless handling of the fireworks. I'm sure we're better off today with fireworks largely handled by professionals. Yet there was a thrill never to be forgotten in seeing a tin can blown 30 feet in the air by a giant "cracker" Â giant meaning it was about 4 inches long. But enough of nostalgia.  Somewhere in our growing up we began to be aware of the meaning of days and with that awareness came the birth of patriotism. July Fourth is the birthday of our nation. I believed as a boy, and believe even more today, that it is the birthday of the greatest nation on earth.  There is a legend about the day of our nation's birth in the little hall in Philadelphia, a day on which debate had raged for hours. The men gathered there were honorable men hard-pressed by a king who had flouted the very laws they were willing to obey. Even so, to sign the Declaration of Independence was such an irretrievable act that the walls resounded with the words "treason, the gallows, the headsman's axe," and the issue remained in doubt.  The legend says that at that point a man rose and spoke. He is described as not a young man, but one who had to summon all his energy for an impassioned plea. He cited the grievances that had brought them to this moment and finally, his voice falling, he said, "They may turn every tree into a gallows, every hole into a grave, and yet the words of that parchment can never die. To the mechanic in the workshop, they will speak hope; to the slave in the mines, freedom. Sign that parchment. Sign if the next moment the noose is around your neck, for that parchment will be the textbook of freedom, the Bible of the rights of man forever."  He fell back exhausted. The 56 delegates, swept up by his eloquence, rushed forward and signed that document destined to be as immortal as a work of man can be. When they turned to thank him for his timely oratory, he was not to be found, nor could any be found who knew who he was or how he had come in or gone out through the locked and guarded doors.  Well, that is the legend. But we do know for certain that 56 men, a little band so unique we have never seen their like since, had pledged their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor. Some gave their lives in the war that followed, most gave their fortunes, and all preserved their sacred honor.  What manner of men were they? Twenty-four were lawyers and jurists, 11 were merchants and tradesmen, and nine were farmers. They were soft-spoken men of means and education; they were not an unwashed rabble. They had achieved security but valued freedom more. Their stories have not been told nearly enough.  John Hart was driven from the side of his desperately ill wife. For more than a year he lived in the forest and in caves before he returned to find his wife dead, his children vanished, his property destroyed. He died of exhaustion and a broken heart.  Carter Braxton of Virginia lost all his ships, sold his home to pay his debts, and died in rags. And so it was with Ellery, Clymer, Hall, Walton, Gwinnett, Rutledge, Morris, Livingston and Middleton. Nelson personally urged Washington to fire on his home and destroy it when it became the headquarters for General Cornwallis. Nelson died bankrupt.  But they sired a nation that grew from sea to shining sea. Five million farms, quiet villages, cities that never sleep, 3 million square miles of forest, field, mountain and desert, 227 million people with a pedigree that includes the bloodlines of all the world. In recent years, however, I've come to think of that day as more than just the birthday of a nation.  It also commemorates the only true philosophical revolution in all history.  Oh, there have been revolutions before and since ours. But those revolutions simply exchanged one set of rules for another. Ours was a revolution that changed the very concept of government.  Let the Fourth of July always be a reminder that here in this land, for the first time, it was decided that man is born with certain God-given rights; that government is only a convenience created and managed by the people, with no powers of its own except those voluntarily granted to it by the people.  We sometimes forget that great truth, and we never should.  Happy Fourth of July. Ronald Reagan President of the United States  Happy Birthday America.

      I often hear the anti-war left say that our fight in Iraq has become a recruiting boon for Al Qaida and other terrorist groups. The ranks are swelling, right? Osama-bert, AQ's evil HR director, is so flooded with terrorist interns that he's resorted to hiding from them in Afghani caves. To wit,  urlLink here 's former Ambassador Joe Wilson: "In the war on terror, we have grown the number of potential terrorists exponentially," he said. "If you believe by abusing force you're going... to contribute to the emergence of an Arab middle class, ...you forget that doctors and lawyers do not win revolutions. Zealots win revolutions. [This war] has been a terrific recruiting tool for al-Qaeda." We're actually growing terrorists, he says, like little Chia-pets, except instead of growing green and leafy, they explode in your hand.  One thing that strikes me is that Wilson and his liberal friends never provide any evidence to back up their assertion.  That's because, as it turns out, their Chia-terrorist theory doesn't hold much water (pardon the pun). You might have seen a recent post about this over at  urlLink GlennReynolds.com . Glenn quotes from StrategyPage's Jim Dunnigan: The fact of the matter is that al Qaeda, and their predecessor, the Moslem Brotherhood in Egypt, have turned Arab populations against them whenever they practiced their terror tactics "at home."  Moreover, when al Qaeda was in control of the government, as they were in Afghanistan, they quickly became hated by the average Afghan.   Al Qaeda was most popular in Arab countries when it was not operating in any Arab countries, but instead concentrating on attacks on Western targets. But the war on terror has forced al Qaeda back to its homelands, and concentrated them in Iraq.  There,  al Qaeda is becoming as hated as it already is in the West . This hatred led to the Moslem Brotherhood's defeat, and expulsion from Egypt over a decade ago. The same thing is happening again in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. Recent surveys have shown support for bin Laden and al Qaeda shrink dramatically in Saudi Arabia (from 96 percent in late 2001, to less than a quarter of that currently.) It's easy to admire terrorists from a distance, rather more difficult when they are terrorizing you.  Iraq is rapidly becoming al Qaeda's graveyard . Very nice. Glenn also quotes an Iraqi blogger who says his anti-American friends were finally won over upon our follow-through with the transfer of sovereignty to Iraq's new government. As he might say, read the whole thing.  I came across Joe Wilson's statement, above, after his appearance on the David Letterman show Tuesday night. For a right-proper  urlLink fisking  of the Wilson interview, head on over to  urlLink fishkite , where I provide some timely analysis and a partial transcript.  Meanwhile, I'll be working on my repertoire of Al Qaida intern jokes.

      Every so often, I pick up the  urlLink North Shelby Times , the little paper that could. It hovers between being a real, if shoestring, newspaper and being a Shopper's Guide rag.  The Editor is a gentleman named Frank Holland, who makes no bones about his partisan Democrat, anti-Bush leanings. His editorials are always on the front page, bottom-right corner. They are rants, really, bordering on the incoherent at times. But, it's his paper and he can do what he wants with it. That's the beauty of America.  Today, I happened to glance at a copy in the Pig on Madison while grocery shopping. What caught my eye -- and frankly almost stopped my heart -- was a picture of senior Shelby County Democrat, chairman of the County Democratic Party, Kathryn Bowers. Above her picture was the large headline  urlLink "A Call to Arms."   Was she going to repeat the carefully constructed misrepresentations of Roger Easson in the party's newspaper,  The Democrat ? I've already shown how his article has suspicious borrowings from an Internet email making the rounds earlier this year. Substantial borrowings (half his article) Easson claims to know nothing about. He denies ever having seen it.  Bowers is smart enough to use her own words, but she repeats the same untruth: that a second Bush administration means an automatic return to the draft for men and women from 18 - 26. Of course, I don't think this is true and have been documenting why for a while now. You can also read  urlLink Rev. Don Sensing's blog , where he has also clearly explained why this isn't likely to happen.  Her stuff is pernicious in repeating assumptions and bias and outright partisan propaganda as fact.   To top this off, this administration plans -- should the American people be so unwise as to elect it in November for another four years -- to restart the draft. Thousands of young men and women will be summoned to participate in military adventures planned by the Neoconservatives who have brought us this quagmire called Iraq.  Thi is not a call to artms about some distant threat. This is a call to arms fro the defense of the future of all our young men and women 18-26. During the next 12 months, their young lives are going to be disrupted by a universal call to military service. they will be conscripted by a government zealous to send you into the Middle East on another pre-emptive attack on Iran or Syria....  The volunteer army, the peace divident we harvested with the end of the Cold War, is no longer capable of providing enough blood or body bas required for this president's adventures in pre-emptive war....  That's enough. You get the idea.  I feel a bit like Alice through the looking glass here. It is simply passed over as irrelevant, so beneath concern it is never mentioned any more, that the draft bills were introduced by  Democrats ! They did it as a political taunt to the President and as a way to try to stir up young people, much as Bowers does here.  The fundamental dishonesty and distortion doesn't even concern these people. That leaves me so disoriented I don't see how I can talk to people who can hold such a  1984 -ish doublethink in their heads. It's, to me, a sign of such driven, malicious delusion as to render them beyond the pale.  Honest debate can be had regarding a potential draft. You can look at figures and needs, look at the situation in the Middle East, make reasonable assumptions, and see how its a possibility. I can have a discussion with someone like that. But when you encounter a Bowers or Easson or Holland, who will not even be honest, how can you get anywhere?  Frankly, you can't. But neither can you push them aside. One edits the local party paper and the other edits a local newspaper; the third is the  doyen  of the local party. I would hope that reasonable, intelligent people would disavow them and walk away.  I suspect that won't happen. Whole swathes of the Democrat party are heading in furious foment for the cliffs, aware of their passing from the scene and yet unable to see it. You can only stand aside and watch the destruction and waste with great sorrow.

      Rita Clark gets to keep on wasting taxpayer money, and my favoured candidate for District 83 came in second. Worst of all, white supremist James Hart won the GOP primary for U.S. House district 8. This man is so far left that he  urlLink makes Kerry look Amish : Hart's campaign literature, containing such lines as, "Is it truly moral to be patriotic and fight for God and country?" may cost him votes among VFW members. Others may take exception to his main campaign issue, expressed in a 40-page campaign pamphlet titled "Favored Races." "Our present welfare system is redistributing life support systems away from the capable to the incapable and thus reducing the genetic quality of future generations," it says. Hart, 60, favors eugenics, which he defines as "the idea that we're going to improve biologically the quality of our species." He also opposes usury, free trade agreements, affirmative action and tax cuts for the super-rich.  "When it comes to workers' rights," he says, "I'm so far left I make Karl Marx look like the Christian Coalition."  The Republican Party couldn't stop Hart from running on their ticket, but they tried to defeat him. I received not one, but two email notifications asking that everyone in that district write in "Dennis Bertrand". But the  sheep  general public all too often votes the party and not the man. With 75% of the precints reporting, Hart is ahead with a whopping 94% of the vote. With voters like these, Bush could be in trouble.

      When I moved to Tennessee a decade or so ago, I was shocked to find that literacy is not a requirement for a drivers license. Really -- there was a machine that would read the questions to you so you could choose the appropriate answer. I don't know what these people are going to do when confronted with roadside signs warning of hazards.  After I lived here a while, I was shocked to find that  urlLink 64 of Memphis' 73 schools were classified as "failing" .  But now nothing surprises me, not even when I find that according to the University of Wisconsin's study " urlLink America's Most Literate Cities ", Memphis ranks 67 th  out of 79. "I'm shocked,"  urlLink said Memphis City Council chairman Joe Brown . "I thought we were much farther up the ladder than that. We need to raise the level that's for sure. It's so important that education receives the necessary funding." Typical Democrat reaction -- we need to spend more money. Not a word about removing the gangs, or getting parents more involved, or even removing bureaucratic waste and overhead. No, we just need to spend more money. That'll fix it!

      It's election day in Tennessee -- primaries for State-level office and the "real" election for county and city offices. Which means a very light turnout because most voters don't realize the importance of these races.  For example, even though it is a primary for state offices, there are  six  Republican candidates running for House District 83. As this district encompasses Germantown, it is a heavily Republican-leaning area. So whoever wins the Republican primary will win the general election.  Also, the County Assessor race is being contested. The incumbent is Rita Clark, who has overspent her budget by  9 million dollars . Her challenger is Harold Sterling, who held the office in the early nineties. He saved the county one million dollars during his tenure.  The Commercial Appeal has, for some inexplicable reason,  urlLink endorsed  Rita Clark.  I pray that their endorsement counts for nothing.

      Witness our city - adding  urlLink injury  to  urlLink insult .  Perhaps the thieves were just acting out because, "we shouldn't have two different economies in this country." Perhaps they are not convinced that  urlLink hope is on the way , even though John Edwards delivered the message to Memphis in person yesterday, only hours before the attack.

      College football is a serious thing. Right now there's a Tennessee Lottery radio commercial that exclaims, "What does the color Orange have anything to do with Tennessee?" The other voice says, "Y'all ain't from around here, are ya?" Meaning the Big Orange Machine, the University of Tennessee.  Well, Kerry screwed up big time. He went into Wolverine territory (University of Michigan) and yelled that he was a Buckeye (Ohio State) fan. Considering that these two schools have a 100 year rivalry, I'm surprised he wasn't lynched.  Just another nail in his coffin. This guy really doesn't know what is going on.

      Just to follow Steve's theme... today I sent  urlLink this Iraq war summary  to some of my co-workers and got a terrific response. One guy called me up and said he'd be forwarding the information to all his friends. In another recent episode, I talked to a co-worker of mine who said she was "on the fence," in part because of the stem-cell issue. After I explained to her the reality about Bush's decision on that and what the status quo actually is, she said, and I quote, "I need to stop watching MTV."  Well, yes.  We need to care, and we need to speak out. Lots of people are receptive, because we offer something that is radically different than the Left - it is positive, pro-American and reasoned. It is also something that many of our friends and co-workers have never actually thought about before, or areas where they have been mislead, and those areas abound.

      Tonight  urlLink I wrote an entry  in response to some total nonsense I read at another site. I'm asking each of you who believes, as I do, that this country has fared rather well under President Bush's leadership to respond in a similar fashion. I've simply grown weary of those who - strictly for the purpose of winning - will say anything to tear down what is great about the USA. I'm not mentioning the guy's name here because I don't want to give him the satisfaction. However, his position should not go unchallenged. Please use your influence and your talent to counter him.  Thanks to any and all who "get it."
