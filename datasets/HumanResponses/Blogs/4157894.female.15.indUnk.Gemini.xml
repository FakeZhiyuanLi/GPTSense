      So I was just about to write in my blog when my mom started reading my blog and saw the title of it and was like "WHATS THAT?????". I told her it was a blog, a type of online diary, so i had to walk her through the tour on the website. She thinks its really weird and that I'm communicating with strange people and being exposed to porno sites and junk. Although it's not like I can't do that from anywhere on the internet (not that I would want to).  Not only THAT, but I was also signed online at the time when I was going through the tour, and she saw one of my friends sign on, and she was like "WHO'S THAT?!?!?" I told her it was Erin (a girl, but my mom thinks it's a boy as in "Aaron") and she says "Oh, i don't know Erin". I was like well, do you have to know everyone i know?....She said no, but later asked who I'm always talking to online at 2 o'clock in the morning, and I told her it was Stephanie and sometimes Casey (she knows both of them) She probably doesn't believe me, but....do i care?    God, I really need some privacy in my life!

       Have you got any peaches???      Ohhhhh my gosh, Steph and I used to say this all the time over the summer. We kind of had an obsession with english accents thiis summer. Everthing we say would be in an accent. Things such as the following phrases sound HILARIOUS when we say them like that:    :: 'Ave you got any peaches?   :: Do I make your heart go pitter patter?   :: What do you recon...you'll be doin'....five years from now?   :: Do I make you horny, baby? (yes, Austin powers)   :: Nice tone, Love, but can you move?    Soooooo.....   Me- Do I make your heart go pitter patter? Steph - Oh, of course. And do I make YOUR heart go pitter patter? Me- pshhh....no.    Haha It's okay, you know I love you, Stephanie Rada.      That's all I have to say about that. OHHH! except for that we were OBSESSED with Forest Gump. We can say things exactly the way he does, like:  "Momma says my back's as crooked as a question mark." "If I was goin' somewhere, I was RUNNINNNNG!" "I just felt like running."     You know you love me,      Kristen Y

       I had just about the best dream EVER last night.         Of course, my dad woke me up before I got to finish it, but doesn't that always happen? I think it's a rule that you can never be satisfied with the dreams you have. You always end up wanting more the next morning, to go back to that perfect time in the perfect place with that perfect person. It's NOT FAIR!! I would give anything to have that dream again tonight. It made me wake up in a good mood, therefore, I had a pretty good day. It was absolutely perfect.         Of course you're wondering exactly what happened in my dream, but I can't tell you every detail. Otherwise it won't come true. But I CAN tell you that it was with that special someone. It was VERY romantic. Almost the most romantic thing I could ever imagine, and I'm glad I did. We were at the beach, sitting on a dock, watching the beautiful colors of the sunset. There was a cool breeze blowing through my hair. But I wasn't cold at all. His body was warm and loving and he held me tight and whispered in my ear.      THATS IT! Thats all that I can tell you about my dear. I wouldn't want to share every intimate thing, in risk of it not coming true. If my dream was any indication of how he feels about me or what's to come in the future, I can't WAIT to find out what my future has in store for me. It's about time already! I've lived my life dreaming dreams and wishing wishes for way too long. It's time for God to help me make those dreams come true. I think I deserve it by now!            You know you love me,        Kristen Y

       So  , since we're such badass rocker girls (hahaha), Casey and I have decided that we're going to sing in your bathtubs in the morning at exactly 10:47am (completely random time), end up gettting arrested for it, and become jail buddies!! Now doesn't that sound like fun? Oh, you KNOW it does....   You might be wondering why we would get arrested for singing in our bathtubs. Well, I found out it was some law in Pennsylvania that you're not allowed to sing in your bathtub. So since we've both already broken this rule, we're gonna break it AGAIN, but get caught this time!   We'll end up getting arrested at the same time for the same thing, and they'll lock us up in the same cell! Genius, right? We better remember to bring spoons so we can escape....   We're gonna dig a hole in our cell so we can escape to china...yes, china. We just hope the Chinese government wont think it's weird and arrest us again for burrowing up from underground like moles.   I wonder if it's illegal to sing in your bathtub in China. Do they take baths in tubs in China??   Any info on this subject would be greatly appreciated!   You know you love me,  Kristen

      I've decided to make a somewhat entertaining blog, whith LOTS AND LOTS of hilariously funy, kneee-slapping, make milk come out of your nose, acidentaly piss your pants kinda of jokes.  (Ok, maybe not THAT funny, but they're pretty funny, with the exception of a few)       First, the #1 funniest joke of ALL time courtesy of Steph:      Why do firefighters wear suspenders?    To keep their pants up!      MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *choke*......hahahahahahaha....ok I'm done!     ok, more jokes for y'all now...      What kind of cans are there in Mexico?   Mexicans. ( i like it 'cause it's lame!)    What were the 2 Mexican FireFighting Brother's names?  Hose A and Hose B  Yo mama so poor, when you ring her bell, she sticks her head out the window and yells, "DING DONG!"   Yo mama's so ugly, your father tkaes her to work with him every day just so he won't have to kiss her goodbye!!!  (mwahahahaha i love that one)   A van of Mexicans drives off a clip and everyone dies, what's the sad part?  Empty seat!!!  Knock, Knock Whoâ€™s there? I know it's you. Crap.  Would a fly without wings be called a walk?   Can you be a closet claustrophobic?   Why do they lock gas station bathrooms?   Are they afraid someone will clean them?   When it rains, why don't sheep shrink?   If the funeral procession is at night, do folks drive with their lights off?   Why is the word abbreviation so long?   Why do people who know the least know it the loudest?   If a turtle doesn't have a shell, is he homeless or naked?   Should vegetarians eat animal crackers?   If the cops arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain silent?

              I haven't set foot outside my house at almost 2 days...it's starting to get really boring. I've dont everything there is to do, even things that I don't WANT to do, like empty the dishwasher and junk like that. I feel sorry for the dog because she has to stay home with boring old me, and she hasn't been out to the bathroom in several hours. I should be ashamed of myself for not taking care of her....she's a DOG, she can't take herself to the bathroom or feed herself, and all she's been doing is sleeping since about 2 this afternoon. I'l probably take her outside and play frisbee soon.          So , I'm wondering if i have friends anymore lol. The only people outside my family that I've talked to in almost two days are Steph and casey. I was supoposed to go swimming with Casey today since the weather's nice, but she doesn't have a ride anymore. And she had a 4-h meeting tonight, so she can't go to a movie or anything. And Steph lives in Vegas so I obviously can't do anything with her. This sucks a fat monkey's balls. I wish i had other firends that are more outgoing than most of the ones I've got here. Liz and her friends seem like people tht I could fit in really well with, but theres almost NO way that they'll all like me.            That's another thing. Why can't people just accept you for who you are? Like, why do they have to be so judgemental and only like you if you are a certain way?.......And if you screw up with the first impression like I did, will they give you a second chance? Most likely not, because they assume your first impression is the real you. But what if you deserve one, because you weren't the one being mean in the first place?!?! (*cough cough*)        But for now I'll just have to make due with what I've got and hope for the best. So I'm ALL SMILES HERE!!!   Love Always,     Kristen

       So...I'm STILL sitting here in front of the computer, despite the fact that it is 1:30 in the morning. My back really hurts from leaning over the keyboard so much, and I'm sure I'm causing eye strain. Oh well, I want to keep writing, because I want to have a really interesting blog. Right now, it's really really boring, but thats only because I just started. I don't have anywhere to go today (then again, do I EVER)....well, I was supposed to go the the pool with Casey today, but it turns out she can't go because 1) she cant get a ride and 2) she has to work on Grange Fair projects. Oh, poo. This makes me mad because I really want to get out of this house and do something with my friends. When Steph was here I would almost never be home because I'd either be at her house or out somewhere...with HER.But now that she moved back home to Las Vegas (I know, it sucks), it seems like I dont have any friends, when in reality it's just that I havent spent any time with them lately because I've always been with Steph. But I'm going to now make the effort to actually spend time with them this summer, hahahahahaha!     OMG! i have to tell you about the time that Dan and Nacho came over to her house. We knew that they had planned to come over that day, but we had never expected them to ACTUALLY come over....but we were online, and they signed on and said that they couldn't make it that day (big surprise..oh yeah, we knew they'd never come). Turns out that they didnt have a ride, and it was too long of a bikeride....so we offered to give them a  ride , and they accepted! So we had to go to the science park pool to pick them up. Steph's car only fits 4 people, and there were 5 of us...you have NO idea how happy I was to be squished in between Dan and Nacho the entire LONG car ride to Steph's house. And when the car turned, we all tilted and ended up being even MORE squished into each other. Each time the car turned, I breathed in to smell *him* (can't tell you with one it is, sorry!). DAMN, did he smell good! He was kind of all hot and sticky. But go ahead, ask me if I cared. So when we got to Steph's house, we all sat down in the living room and watched "Once Upon a Time in Mexico". It was soooooo quiet, I almost couldn't stand it...I started laughing in the middle of the movie, and everyone looked at me as if I was crazy (except for Steph, cause she knew wy I was so giggly. Haha, I like that word. Giggly)    So when the movie was over, we finally went downstairs and played some pool and ping-pong and air hockey, then sat around and talked for a while. I went upstairs to get water, and when I came back down they had already started another game of pool. Nacho looked me straight in the eye and said "You wanna play?"...OMFG, I almost melted into a big puddle of lovesick mush right then and there! Inside, I was saying "Oh, HELLS YEAH, I wanna play!!", but all I really said was "Sure."...sometimes I just hate myself for not speaking up hahaha. But we played pool (Steph and I lost, by the way), and talked for a while. Theres a really interesting story about me and a bucket, but we won't get into that......so yeah, basically the best day of my life. And the worst, at the same time. This was the day that I found out my best friend likes him, too. Funny story...kind of.      Love Always, Kristen

      Please listen and read the lyrics to this song by BBMak. I feel that this song has a very important message in it. It told me to never give up hope. Never give up the hope that I will find someone to love, and someone who loves me back. Well, here it is:   "Love Is Unpredictable"    How can I convince you that you're really not alone   And I know exactly what you're going through?   Nothing is for certain, but there's one thing that I know   Never underestimate what love can do      I want to show you   Even though there are no guarantees   Just let me hold you   Love can do most anything   If you just believe      It can take you to the highest high   Make you sacrifice it all   Love is unpredictable   It can change your life forever   Or it may never hear your call   Love is unpredictable   Na na na na na       We don't need to justify, we don't need to wait   All will be revealed to us in time   And if you intellectualize the meaning of this fate   You may never know what we could find      Don't keep me waiting   Don't you keep me hanging on the line   I'm only saying   You won't know what love can do, if you never try      It can take you to the highest high   Make you sacrifice it all   Love is unpredictable   It can change your life forever   Or it may never hear your call   Love is unpredictable   Na na na na na      Don't you wanna see which way this love will go   It can take you to the highest high   It can change your life forever            THANK YOU, AND COME AGAIN!!!!

             So I'm listening to my Ashlee Simpson cd, and I'm writing in my blog (obviously), and I'm really listening to the lyrics of this song on her cd. It's an ordinary day at an ordinary moment, and I'm doing ordinary things. But something just came to me that i left was worth sharing, out or the ordinary. The song is called "Better Off." The chorus goes:                                                                    But so what? I'm better off everyday                                                                   When I'm standing in the pouring rain,                                                      I dont mind...I think of you and everything's alright                                                                           I used to think I had it good                                                                  But now I know that I misunderstood                                                             With you I'd say, I'm better off in every way            This remind me of the way I feel about Ignacio. I can be standing in the rain, cold and hungry, feeling like crap and never wanting to go home. But as long as I'm thinking of him, everything is okay. He and thoughts of him will always have a warm place in my heart. I used to think I had a really bad life, with no love and no hope. But I have now realized that he has given me a gift. He has inspired me to be a better person and be all I can be in life. He is my inspiration for everything I do in life. Whenever I'm feeling down, I think of him, and he gives me the strength to carry on. I don't believe tht anyone cares aout him more than I do.                 I love him for more than his looks. He is smart, and I love the fact that I can learn from him. He is funny, and has the amazing ability to cheer me up in the wort situations. He is caring, not like other guys I've met. He cares about your feelings and wants to help you out. I care about him in the same way, and I want him to do and have whatever makes him happy. Even if it doesn't involve me. I was sent to this earth to care for him, and I will do exactly that for all eternity.

      My heart is full of fire. An ongoing flame that burns deep in my soul keeps me alive when things are tough, and keeps me grounded when things seem to explode, one after another. It takes me away from reality when I need time to sort things out. That flame is the art of dance. My soul dances every hour of every day, with every breath I take. Dance is a way for me to express my feelings,and what is really in my heart. It can express things with cannot be shown through writing of song. In dance, each movement has its own breath, it's own beat, it's ownn life. Much like myself. I feel it in my body, the movement of each minute, each feeling in my life, whether it's up or down, fast or slow. I feel it...and show it. The only thing that can stop me from dancing is death, my extinguished flame.

      It's funny how things work out...or don't. When something seems so perfect that it's almost to good to be true, it probably is. I thought i had found love. My first true love, an experience I would never forget. I'll always remember this experience, but not for love. For betrayal, lying, and the downfall of a very important relationship with my best friend. Anna had come up to visit for the summer, and I couldn't have been more excited. We had an amazing summer planned, with road trips, parties, and a special rendez-vous with a special group of boys, one of which was my "significant other." However, I had no intention of letting my two best friends develop romantic feelings for each oher, but that is exactly when had come to be. And worse? Anna keeps denying her feelings for him, and pretends that I don't notice. My only chance for true love was completely destroyed by the one i trust the most. What's a girl to do? There is nothing that can change my feelings for him. And nothing will jepoardize my relationship with my best friend, not even a boy. Talk about a love knot.
