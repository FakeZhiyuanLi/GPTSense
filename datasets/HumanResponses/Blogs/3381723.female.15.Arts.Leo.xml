      Hey hey... I saw 'Shrek 2' last night! All I can say is... "....thats not mine." LOL Haha then Katelin came over for a sleepover and we watched '10 Things I Hate About You'. It was fab. Thennnnnnnn we watched 'Win A Date With Tad Hamilton' the next morning. Haha it was cute. I saw it with Amy at the theatre way back in January. Hmm hmm what else happened today? I went to band practice. Brianna wasn't there cuz she's in Red Deer. We didn't really get a lot accomplished, and then we tried to practice with Jason on drums and we were playing 'Hooked' in slow-mo cuz he couldn't drum fast enough. Funniest thing EVER. Yup yup! And that's about all I did today. I finished Berlynn's pony (the dead one), and I started re-rooting Bon-Bon. Guess I have to start working on Berlynn's sad pony, eh??? Hahaha I have no clue what to do with her though, so.. yeah.. we'll see how that works ;)

      So, apparently my brother & sister both hate me. Huzzah. Guess I should throw a party. Well, I'm probably going to Shrek 2 tonight at SilverCity... hopefully I'll see Alex :) That would cheer me up! Haha so... what did I do today?? Nothing really much. I worked on a new song though! Yay!!!! It's called "Heart Breakers Society" lol and it's dedicated to Katelin ;) Cuz I heart her! I also worked on one of Berlynn's ponies (the dead one). She has approx. 12 more plugs of hair than she did before... and I still have 24 more plugs to do... ahhhhhhh!!! But I touched up some of her paint & junk and I straightened what hair she has so it looks much better now. I still need to straighten her tail though... too crimpy x.x and her mane is too short in comparison to her tail, so I guess I'll have to cut it. And I need to find out whether you can use temporary tattoos as symbols or not. MEMO TO MYSELF: ask at MLPArena.

It was tres cool. And at lunch I bought this ginormous butter tart... it was HUGE. It was like... a BOWL. It was toight :D! Yeah I had some interesting dreams in the past two days... the other night it was Lexi crying & me drowning, and last night it was Guilty As Charged camping with Grand Redemption for no apparent reason! It was sexy. Haha I won't bore you with details, though. And by YOU I mean ME because I'm the only person who reads this :S Oh yeah, btw, Jared didn't cut his hair MWAHAHAHA!! Because I told him not to and I have such an influence on his decisions ;) LOL not... Haha yeah so BEST GROUP EVER!!! LOL and and and... "I got O POSITIVE blood! It's flowing through my veins! o/`" Haha that was Dave & I on the C-Train this morning. We were talking about musicals and stuff and how we might be doing Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory next year... or wait isn't it Charlie And The Chocolate Factory? So confusing x.x... but, yeah, I WOULD BE SO HAPPY! I would *SO* be VERUCA SALT! HAHA!! I WANT IT NOW, DADDY!!!

So, Katelin & I wrapped up our scavenger hunt today and I still have 15 pictures left... I'll probably take some photos of my ponies... because I HEART MY PONIES! Haha well... in other news, my FENCE fell down this morning. It was funny. And Kristin's MSN works now! Yay! Hmm and I saw Dick McFace today and I smiled at him and he ignored me and started talking to his friend even though he CLEARLY saw me. What a dickface. BLAH. So anyways I have a Trig test tomorrow... annnnnnnnd on Friday I'm going to this "Art Of Acting" thingy downtown so I get to miss school mwahaha! Oh yes and Erin & I got "A Boy Like That" and Ashley was helping me hit the high notes because she's such a doll :) Annnnnnd...

Katelin & I decided we're gonna put together some scrapbook/photo album type thingies. It's gonna be awesome :) For mine, we're doing a scavenger hunt type thingie. We've got 11 things from the list so far! But we're gonna take some more photos tomorrow :D So I'm looking forward to that. I need to take a picture of Jared before he gets rid of his hair on Thursday :S I'm going to kill him. His hair is too sexy lol and he's gonna chop it off. He's insane. Hmm... what else happened today?? Oh yeah Ms. DL has no clue who to give the "Boy Like That" contract piece to! If Erin & I don't get it, I won't be in the first half of our musical theatre show at all :S Haha that's cool though, just means  get to chill backstage - and less costume changes! Anyways I must go draw some Catwoman in Colormist's sketchbook! Peace out :D!

      I haven't written in a while... so I thought maybe I should write today. Hmm well we have a show on Friday with Grand Redemption, The Noseholes, and Steve's band. Only 3 people are coming to see us... hahaha! Oh well, we have another show next week... in other news, I am tres depressed :( I guess I shouldn't be... but I dunno... my two closest friends are all in love and junk and I'm, of course, not. Everyone's always like "Oh, lots of guys like you Brittney! They're just too shy!" but you know what?? WHATEVER. I know you're all just trying to make me feel better. C'mon, where's the proof?! I just wish that I could be the LIKEE instead of the LIKER for once...  I'm here if you want me, I'm yours, you can hold me I'm empty and taken and tumbling and breakin' 'Cause you don't see me, and you don't need me And you don't love me, the way I wish you would The way I know you could  ((crystal and see-through and not enough to you))

      Today I went to Calaway Park with Misha, Kristin and Brianna, to go see Jeff Diodati starring as EDDIE in "Eddie Meets Broadway"! But OF COURSE, today was the other guy's turn to be Eddie or WHATEVER so Jeff wasn't there x.X! It's so lame though because the people in the productions don't even actually sing or act! All they do is dance and lip sync!! It's so dumb!! Haha then we went on the roller coaster and Misha came to the line late cuz he was getting Dippin' Dots, so he had to get through the rest of the line to get to us and this like 12 year old kid wouldn't let him through and was being a jerk and he was like "IT'S A GOOD THING YOU'RE GAY!" and Misha was like "Uh.. I'm not the one that's here with two guys!!" and the kid was like "Let's go. Meet me after the ride." and we were like oh man he's like 12 what's he going to do?? And next thing you know, we turn around and this like MONSTROUS kid with this skunk/mullet/mohawk look going on has JOINED the little 12 year old, along with like 2 other guys! Hahaha... but nothing happened cuz they were pansies ;) "What are you like 3?!?! Crater Face!!!" lol!! And uh we went on other rides.. and sang KENYA! And yup that's pretty much it!  "I'm pregnant!" - Son "But - but you're my son!" - Dad "I'm really a man!" - Daughter ".... did you impregnate him?!?!" - Dad "Ya!" - Mom

      Wheee! Today was fun! Well OK not like extreme fun - but fun all the same ^^! Kristin & I went for a walk up to Shoppers and we looked at some cards... lol when I'm old, I'm still going to send people little kids cards - you know the ones with Pokemon &amp; Hello Kitty on them lol!! It'll be like.. "Happy birthday! You're six!... ty-six!" And some guy parked his car in the middle of the road! lol!! ("MAYBE HE'S JUST DUMB!!!")  Haha I showed Kristin a whole bunch of Flash movies today... cuz her parents don't let her surf the web so I have to drag her over to my house to show her things...&nbsp;We watched uh.. KENYA, among other things!! But, Omigosh! Don't watch that!! It'll get stuck in your head!! Haha and we went to  urlLink www.homestarruner.com ! (Fhqwhgads!!!)&nbsp;And then we went to her house and sat on her deck, harmonizing Simple Plan songs.... loudly lol. Some kids on a trampoline (I think..?) yelled "SHUT UP!" at us! Meh! I thought we sounded pretty good! A little country lol but pretty good!! Kristin's dad said we should learn to harmonize some country songs - he said we could probly get paid gigs at the Stampede lol. Then we had dinner (and dessert! Yum!) and then went for a walk again, singing Shakira and Hilary Duff this time x.X. Then I went home and uh here I am! And&nbsp;tomorrow I'm going to THE CAVE!! Well, hopefully haha.. anyway here's some DINNER CONVO:   "...seeped into the organs.." - Kris' mom, just as I was saying "MmmmmMMMmmmm.."   "Yoink!!!" - Kristin, as she grabbed some more dessert   "Ba-dummmmmm" - Kris making the bass noise as we made drum beats with our forks on the cups/plates   "In his dreams ONLY!" - Me, making an impression of Patrick's mom

      My other friend with the legs ran the hot bath.  The moral of the story is don't have ugly babies.  Red lollipops are GREAT!  The moral of the story is never ever love a sofa more than your spouse. It always ends BAD!  The moral of the story is never ever ever get naked with Melissa because she is retarded.  That pretty much sums up todays events.
