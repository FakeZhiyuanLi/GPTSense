      I finally got a dream..i now given myself a target of 6 years to  learn piano,guitar and composing..i learn that not becoz i want to become a singer....is i really want my music to be shared wif everyone...around me...maybe during the 6 years of sinking deep into music..alot of ppls will disagree wif me...but i going to be very stubborn this time round in music...i not going to give up..and not going to bother anyone who stop my way...  I love what Hins Zhang wrote in his song "Sheng Yin"   釋放你的聲音 透露你的感(心)情 把屬於你的故事 唱給每一個人聽GO 我一直在聆聽 要用掌聲證明 現在你就是最耀眼的明星 別讓太多困難迷惑了你的眼睛 堅定的信念如影隨形  音樂不一定能讓誰變成明星 只要你用了心(用了心) 就有最真的感情 你要用你的心和聲音 打動每一個心靈 你要用你的心去聆聽 每個角落的聲音 你要用信心  勇敢去面對路的高低不平 雨遇就會天睛堅強努力前行 你要用你的心和聲音 打動每一個心靈 你要用你的心卻聆聽 每個角落的聲音 音樂的聲音 能化作天空最閃亮的流星 要你用心聆聽用真心感應   That the passion toward music...  i going to change my lifestyle of chasing idol totally...coz i dont want to waste any more time....  after getting my school time-table i going to plan my schedule for my music lesson...i have to work very hard for what i aiming now and then...i don't wish to be slacker any more coz i ord find my dream...  anyway even i sank very deep into music...dun worry of my study i going to study hard too...i will plan my time properly...  Anyway the last step of stepping into music was either to Lee Wei Song School of Music or The Music Clinic to learn Composing...

      跟你在一起時最不想說的就是再見  重覺得說完再見就好像要消失  看到的背影都不是真實的  我這樣努力的追但都追不上你  應為你在那裡我都看不見  只有獨自掉近回憶裡  往前走卻是個走不完的路  看到的光卻是個幻覺  醒過來才發現我們革這一段很遙遠的距離  在這樣的靠近對方都離不開那段距離  應為各自都找不到自己真陣想要的感情  p.s: 這是一個虛幻的世界﹐看到的東西也都是假的﹐只有用心才能看到真實的世界

      明天又要跟他們出去了。。。  我有點不想出去偶  覺得好悶阿  我可以改掉我的現在的生活嗎?  我不喜歡的朋友  我不喜歡的事情  我只能多兩個禮拜去register我的guitar lesson  真希望我的夢想快點實現  但如果夢想沒盡力過苦難。。。我想也不叫做夢想了吧  我現在好像找人聊天阿。。  找一個我不認識我的人。。。但有談的來的人  很難吧  我也很難跟他說寫什麼  我現在好像去澎湖的海邊。。。  住在海邊的人真好。。。  我也好像過那種生活  我的生活就那麼無聊  我寫不出故事來  我好像談戀愛  那種很真實的戀愛  但我又怕我會失去  我是個很奇怪的女生  我愛自由  我不希望有人會關我  好了我不想在說下去了。。  因為我不懂我自己在說什麼  。。。。。。
