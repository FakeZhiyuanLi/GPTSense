      Patti Smith is coming to Vancouver and I am so freaking excited I cannot believe it. Has anyone bought her new album "Trampin'"? It is extremely good. She's very political, very tender, howls shockingly loud...and as for lyrics, no one beats her: "Boots that tread from track to track/ worn down to the sole/ One road is paved with gold/ One road is just a road."

As my holidays come nearer, I am finding myself more and more not into work. Yesterday one of the girls I work with went mental on the air and screamed so much at our dispatcher (who has been borderline psychotic all week) I felt like quitting. Who needs to deal with that much aggression?? Not only that, she was super late with deliveries that she really had no reason to be so aggro about him telling her to speed it up(20 mins late with a non-stop delivery when it's only 7 blocks away)? So he went off the air (to go smoke a few cigarettes) and the rest of us chatted amongst ourselves.

I really hope Brent &amp; I make it to the Yukon but apparently there are forest fires everywhere. I am also a little worried about bears, but we're going to sleep in the back of the truck, so we should be okay. I hope. Hey, does anyone have any tips about how to clean a fish? Sorry about all of the flesh-eating references, Lizz!

       Is veal really that evil? I went to&nbsp; barbeque tonight and ate veal, and someone actually gasped when they realized what I was eating.&nbsp;I felt guilty, but then thought: screw it. I buy organic, I buy free-trade bananas, I buy my milk in a recyclable &nbsp;glass bottle. Can't I indulge in something awful?? I know what Lizz and all the other vegetarians are thinking, and I&nbsp;agree. No more veal, I promise. 
Work was a gong-show. I nearly got smoked -head-on- by a can collector on a piece of shit bike with no brakes, huge bags of cans piled one on top of another on top of his frame. A sketchy way to start the day. It deteriorated. The stand out event was the dispatcher storming out at 5.15 pm to do a delivery that the bikers "refused" to do (read: had no balls to dispatch it)! So he walked for half an hour to get it done. Alas, the delivery was a 30 lb. box. If only he had read the tag first.
I love this new trend of ultra-short flouncy skirts. The wind blows and they fly up. I have seen more bum cheeks in the last month than I have my whole life. It's a bold breed of fifteen year olds out there in the world now.

       I rode all the way into work today, got reimbursed for an extortionate banking fee from the boss, and hung out with some other messengers at the art gallery. Then I took off. It's Monday afterall, and I knew that I should've stayed in bed. The electricity was shut off in&nbsp;my building from 10-2 pm though, and it is too hot in the loft without the fan going, so I went to the Sally Ann for a while instead. 

 There is something cathartic about digging through other people's rubbish.  
That's how I think of my habit of&nbsp;pawing through the piles of dusty cardboard boxes in the 'As-is' section at the Salvation Army. Unfortunately, I think the Sally-Ann's basement is contaminated with asbestos. I never make it through an hour without having to sneeze/cough/shit my pants.&nbsp; 

I've started doing yoga. Seriously! So has Brent. It's improving his posture hugely, and my flexibility. It is really relaxing, and even with all the cycling I do, I never stretch (except if you count bending over to tie my shoes). At the end of class, they offer tea and cookies. Brent went to a recent class, and at the end the teacher said "I have some low-carb, no-fat, no-sugar, no-yeast cookies and herbal tea if anyone would like to join me." He said that he was the only one who did, and she pulled out some Hobnobs.

Okay, so I stole this off of a blog called Will's Thrills (or something like that). I was desparate (is this spelled right? I always get screwed by my pc spell check which constantly switches back to american english NO MATTER WHAT I F*CKING DO!!!!!!)to do something scholarly. I just emailed my prof begging him to bring me in new essay topics tomorrow and please ignore the now undeniable fact that my paper would now officially be written last minute (ie. presumed shitty).

Scary and vital reading. No matter what your views on this invasion of Iraq or any other war are, the only way to keep informed is to scour all available media. Every untimely death is the death of a loved sister, brother, mother, or father, or friend. How does one separate fact from fiction? My personal philosophy is to keep reading, and reading, and reading, and reading, and hopefully somewhere, at some time, truth will emerge.

      Of huge proportions. 'Tis a long weekend. I have a term paper due in 3 days. Alas, out of all of the thousands of loose sheets of paper that I have strewn about the house in some chaotic, moronic filing system, not a single piece of paper resembles the one with my essay topics. So, I have plenty of time (well, it is 8.30 pm on Monday night of a long weekend; that is lots of time for a serial procastinator). But I have no f*cking idea what to write about, other than it is to do with the Romantic period. Whatever. I am hating this class, only because it is impossible to analyze the text. That's right! I am in a college level English course with a bunch of  kids  who are forced to take this to complete an associate degree, not because they like literature. So, when they hear me say, oh, I don't know,  metaphor,  their eyes glaze over. I spend a lot of time doodling and only saying the odd thing (and they think I am odd because I ride a bike so bloody much) in a desperate attempt to get my 10% of grade for participation. Here comes another essay written in the 11th hour.

      Today was Gay Pride Day. The parade was a bit lame, owing to the fact that entrants had to pay $75 extra to play music on their floats. Needless to say, there was not a lot of music. Also, the Royal Bank (as well as various other banks and  Starbucks ) actually chanted for themselves...I didn't think that we went to watch corporations cheer themselves on. Get screwed, RBC. I got a major sunburn on my forehead and nose, thanks to my stupid mirrored sunglasses. So, it was a pretty good day out, just a bit of buybuybuy mentality. The ambulance services and firefighters were in the parade, but of course the cops were not. Why so shy, guys? Hopefully they were out solving one of the many gay-bashing hate crimes that have taken place recently, instead. Well, one can only hope. Best t-shirt: "Oh, her? She's just a friend."
