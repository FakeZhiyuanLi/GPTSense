        There are things which drives each and everyone of us. These things touch us, empower us, move us. These are the fundamentals to our existence,the oxygen we breathe, the reasons for life. Motivation. A word so commonly used nowadays. A word that means so much to our daily living. To tell you the truth there is not a single person in the world without this. Not one. Motivation comes from life itself the struggle to breathe when we first cried out at birth. You might say,well, sorry i don't agree with you, i have no motivation in anything. I am lazy and uninterested in everything. Every morning i wake up and go beack to sleep. When i finally manage to pull myself up i wake up feeling to lazy to make breakfast so i go skip that and go to work. I'm abolutely unmotivated in what ever I am doing. There's nothing that drives me. Believe me or not what drives you moment of your life,every feeling lousy about your job, every grumbling and skipping of breakfast is the hour when you get back in bed.   What?That's nonsense! No just think about it, what do you think of when you wake up in the morning? Going back to sleep. What do you think about when you are at work? How nice would it be to be able to lie in bed now. What do you think about when you are alone driving home? Sleep. The answers to these questions are the key to your motivation in life! So the reason you work the reason you feel tired and the reason you wake up in the morning is so that the night will come again and you can go back to your soft linen bed to sleep! Motivation is what makes you wake up in the morning and do whatever you do.  What motivates people?  1) Achievement 2) Life 3) Love       Achievement If you noticed the acronym of what motivates people is ALL. Everything you see around you has been someone's motivation, drive, disired achievement or inspiration. Is there somthing you want in life? Is there something that excites you in the morning(other than going back to sleep) What is the one thing that inspires you? My dream is to one day own a huge chocolate factory making the best chocolate in the world. It is the possibilty of having that one day that wakes me up. It excites me what i can do each day to move a step closer to that dream. I can see it and feel it. It has huge gates with the initails: SC on them standing for Steven's Chocolate. Walking through the gates i see a building and through the glass doors there's the information counter and elevator leading to the different departments of the company. My office is at the top level of the building i would be sitting in that black chair listening to my secretary as she informs me of the days work... That is my motivation. My inspiration what's yours?            Life Waking up in the morning have you ever felt the greatness of being alive? One of the reasons you can wake up in the morning and go back to sleep is because you are alive! One very important thing you must remember is that where your motivation is, that is where your energy flows. Have you ever felt passionate about living? Have you ever cried helplessly for others?(Compassion) That is the motivation of life, having the sense of what you want to use your time and energy for.      Love The most powerful of the three. Why do i say that because when you read it you suddenly started to pay attention!(You know what i mean) Love makes the world go round. Said so often, it is no cliche! There is no one that cannot love. I am sure you felt it before the nice tingling feeling of hope that you might be able to hold that special someone in your arms to love and be loved. This emotion is so powerful that it sometimes surpasses the motivation of Life and Achievements.      (To Be Continued...)

        What or how do motivation work? Its actually what one has in mind for him or herself. Remember the example of im not motivated? You are actually motivated to do other stuff that people consider lazy: sleeping etc. Motivation is actaully the measure of how much you want something. How much you love yourself and what your goal is. Take for example a boy named peter. He loves to swim and hates studies. So what is his motivation? Swimming. He would propably be day dreaming during class about where he will be swimming after class. How much does he wants it? Maybe immediately after class he would be running home getting changed to go swimming. So the question you need to ask yourself is what do i want that motivates me? And how much do i want it? If you are a student and you say you want your As and you are not getting them, they are not the things that motivates you. You see wanting something dosen't means its the thing that motivates you. The thing that motivates someone is a goal that is achievable in a specific time and it really excites that person.  Go find what really motivates you. And tell me about it.
