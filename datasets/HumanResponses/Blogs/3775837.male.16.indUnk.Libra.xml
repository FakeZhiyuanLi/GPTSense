      Hey all =) Just created this blog,  urlLink blogger.com  seemed the most attractive one to use of them all, and you can see from my description that I'm trying to find a way to create a Flash based blog. This may take a while so I'll probably be using this blog for ages =)  There isn't gonna be any structure to my 'blogging' here, just random stuff I think up along the way.  It's kindof a p*ss take that I'm off on holoday tomorow morning for two weeks till the 14th of July so I won't be able to update it till then lol, but anyway, when I get back I'm sure I'll have loads of stories to bore ya with...  A bit about me, hrmmm. I love to do web design and graphic design, though I may not be all that good with it =) I've just started to get into vector images and animation, and you can see a small sneak peak to what I'm working on over at  urlLink timewaste.co.uk . Another site I recently made is  urlLink blurbreviews.co.uk , and this is still going, I just haven't had a chance to add to it, specially with hols tomorow =/   Chears =)
