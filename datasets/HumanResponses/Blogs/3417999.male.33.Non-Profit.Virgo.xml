      Ah, yes, now you can make sure that your kids don't hear someone who unwittingly triggered Armaggedon in Terminator 3 say "Dear God" while still allowing them the wholesome pleasure of seeing Arnold Schwarzenneger shove his female opponent's head into a toilet.  As David Pogue puts it in his  New York Times  article,  urlLink "Add 'Cut' and 'Bleep' to a DVD's Options" : "...as it is, the evidence suggests that ClearPlay's technology is not intended for families at all. It's for like-minded adults, specifically those who are offended by bad language and sexual situations but don't mind brutality, destruction and suffering.   "Maybe every ClearPlay-sanitized movie ought to begin with a message: 'This film has been modified as follows: It has been formatted to fit the taste, sensibilities and religious beliefs of a couple of guys in Utah. That'll be $1.50.'"  Once again, it's the people crying the loudest about the downfall of U.S. culture that are degrading our society the most. And sticking our country's fists in places we should not be, like Iraq.

      I'm surprised not to have heard any guffaws about George Bush's mangling of the pronunciation of "Abu Ghraib" a couple of days back. When I first heard him say it, I thought there was a glitch in the tape. But then when he got more and more confident in his mispronunciation, I realized that his handlers had once again forgotten to do those flash card exercises with him before he tried to talk.  Of course, I don't watch the Daily Show – or much TV at all – and I can't imagine they'd pass up that opportunity. Maybe it's appropriate he mangled the  prison's name, much as the soldiers there have mangled any sense of human decency. Of course, the entire administration has shredded human rights, civil rights, constitutional rights, and any idea of lawfulness, so it's not as if the soldiers who committed those despicable acts didn't have role models. I don't believe for a minute that these were simply a few rogue soldiers – this reaches up to higher levels, and the U.S. administration, starting with Donald Rumsfeld and George Bush, should be mature enough to take responsibility. Where's Truman when you need him?

      I wrote a couple of days ago about  urlLink the positive aspects of a car-free Manhattan , and possible ways to do it. Now let me tell you what pisses me off about those metal boxes of death:  When I'm walking at a good, steady clip, trying to get some exercise as I get to where I'm going and I have to stop at every damn traffic light just so people in cars can go faster, I become a frustrated young man.  When I have to literally stick my neck out into the street to see past a parked van or SUV to make sure I won't get creamed by oncoming traffic, I contemplate reducing its height a few inches by letting the air out of its tires.  When I'm squeezed on the sidewalk by too many pedestrians and see how much space all those cars are taking, it makes my blood boil.  When drivers act like the second line of the crosswalk is where they should stop for the light, I feel like walking over their hood. Very, very hard.  Don't even get me started on car alarms.  When some car honks at me because I'm riding my bike ahead of them in a narrow lane, I want to put my fist through their horn. As it is, I just pull into the very center of the lane to make absolutely sure they don't try to get by me and scrape me between themselves and the parked cars. Hey buddy, you don't own the damn road!  When I'm forced to breathe your SUV's second-hand smoke, I want to scream. But I don't, because that would mean I'd have to breathe in even more of the air you've fouled.  And when I hear that over half of the people getting hit by cars in New York City are  in the crosswalk , I feel like taking a sledgehammer to the grill of any car that gets near me.  See, especially in a place like New York City, there is so much bad that is associated with cars, that it really outweighs any of the good. So get out of your car and freakin' walk! And while you're at it, check out  urlLink Transportation Alternatives, NYC . They've got all kinds of information on making our cities more human-friendly.

      This blog seems to be turning into a discussion of urban issues, but since that's what's interesting me at the moment, I'm going to keep going with it.  I guess today I'll do a little bragging. Not about me, but about my neighborhood. You see, I grew up in a small ag town in California and, despite its relative diversity, I am still sometimes bowled over by the day-to-day richness of where I live.  My block on the western edge of Park Slope in Brooklyn, New York has people from an amazing variety of ethnicities, races, and nationalities. My own incomplete recollections enumerate:  	- Korean 	- Egyptian 	- Puerto Rican 	- White Boy Mutt (that's me)  That's just in my three-apartment building. On the rest of the block there are also: 	- Japanese 	- African American 	- Italian 	- South Asian 	- Yemeni  Okay, the Yemeni guys actually run the corner store. Which brings up the shops and restaurants in a one-block radius (i.e., less than a minute's walk away): 	- the aforementioned corner store 	- a fish and chips shop that also serves curry and is the inventor of the deep-fried Twinky. 	- a Peruvian restaurant 	- a Mexican restaurant 	- a Thai restaurant 	- an Italian restaurant 	- an excellent deli 	- a barbershop 	- a grocery store 	- a hardware store 	- a big chain video store 	- an odds-and-ends store 	- a travel agency 	- a furniture store 	- a real estate agency 	- a carpeting store 	- some other stores I've forgotten 	 Walk another block in either direction and you'll find a greengrocer, a tattoo parlor, a comic shop, a fancy florist, my bank branch, a fried chicken place, etc., etc., etc.  My block is quite residential and the area around it has only in the last couple of years begun to come into its own. With all that's going on and available so close to me, the area is still human-scale, and walking around is a pleasure. I know a goodly number of my neighbors. The guys at the corner store would pull down prepaid calling cards as soon as I walked in when my girlfriend was away in India. Much as I still feel like a Californian, Brooklyn is New York City's saving grace, and my neighborhood is a very integral part of that.

      Yesterday I biked over to the newly renovated  urlLink Brooklyn Museum of Art  to check out its new look. I wanted to see how well the new glass atrium, the radiating lawns, the ampitheater, and the dancing fountains worked for the space. I was not disappointed.  The renovation gives the plaza and entryway a much-needed multi-level aspect and encourages the surrounding community to utilize it for a myriad of purposes. Before, the museum stood as a blank, vertical, neoclassical monolith across a flat expanse of lawn. This has been broken up by the curving glass atrium that pushes out from the building. The series of narrow lawns, along with the ampitheater to the eastof the entryway, radiate out from the entrance, drawing passersby into the museum's sphere of influence.  The steps of the ampitheater are so broad that I could sit on one step, lie my bike flat in front of me, and still afford plenty of room for someone to sit in front of my bike. These platforms, rather than being solid concrete, are instead framed by it, with the vast majority of the surface area made of wood planking. This planking also features on the walkway that leads from the top of the ampitheater around the curve of the glass entryway and affords interesting views into the entryway itself as well as across the plaza. The stairs down from the other end of the curve are also made of the same wood. While not visible if you are simply passing by, the wood softens the features of ampitheater for those who take the time to sit and conveys a sense of being on a boardwalk, along with the leisure and relaxation that connotes.  Children are drawn to the ampitheater space not just because of the opportunity to run up and down the stairs and make up multilevel activities, but also because of the dancing fountains that provide a visual focus at the bottom of the ampitheater. It has been stated by a number of people that the fountains are a legacy of mall gimmickry. But these fountains are placed right out front rather than inside some courtyard or behind an impenetrable barrier of hedges or tulips. Maybe this is why metal police barricades were set up around their perimeter yesterday. I hope they take those barricades away - looking at how the fountains are situated, I get the sense that the architects wanted to maintain a feeling of openness. Is the museum afraid of liability? That the fountains aren't robust enough for children to play in and amongst them? If they are afraid of these possibilities, and insist on making the fountains themselves off-limits, I would hope they would consider doing it in a way that retains an overall feeling of openness.   I would also be remiss if I didn't note that the fountains use a fair amount of water and I'm sure a not-small amount of energy to run. Much as I feel curmudgeonly for criticizing the fountains on sustainability grounds - since they seem to be an effective draw to the plaza - it is important that we always look to principles of sustainability especially when building new projects. It's possible that the fountains run with treated greywater from the museum and solar cells from the building's roof, and if that's the case, so much the better. In that case, they could become a public educational piece about the possibilities for sustainable design. But somehow I don't think they're doing what I just suggested.  What defines the success of an open space is whether people use it. Yesterday, despite the spurious threat of rain, many people were using the space. People sat on benches under the trees at the west end of the plaza, and a few folks lounged on the lawns in the middle. At the ampitheater, parents lounged on the steps watching their children playing down by the fountains, and not a few kids got themselves purposely drenched when the water blew their way. It was a diverse crowd on the plaza, and it was apparent that many of the people there that day came from the surrounding community. This last point is especially important and positive, because it means that the museum has succeeded in providing a service to the people who live and work around it, and so has integrated itself into the community a little bit more.

      What if Manhattan were a place with no passenger automobiles? What if, for the most part, trucks were also banned? It seems to me that because of its density, the borough is one of the most amenable places for getting around without cars or motor taxis or the like. We could have an extensive networks of electric trams, a fleet of pedicabs, people on bicycles and on foot. The subway system's capacity and extent could be increased. Cargo could be brought in via train and carried to centralized points of the borough using a tram-like system, which could possibly be all underground. Small electric vehicles or pedicabs could then be used to take goods from distribution points to stores and institutions. Many streets could be either wholly or partly converted away from vehicular use into parks, gardens, outdoor shopping, play areas, and the like. Emergency vehicles such as fire engines and ambulances, as well as certain service vehicles, might need to have the same flexibility of movement they do now, along with their current sizes. But police could patrol more on foot, on bikes, or in smaller electric vehicles similar to what the meter cops use now. With a reduction in asphalt, the city would become less of a heat sink it is now. With less fossil-fuel burning vehicles, air would be cleaner. As a pedestrian-oriented city, even more tourists would be attracted. And vehicle-related stresses would be reduced. These are a few initial thoughts, and I would welcome comments, additions to this narrative, and the like. I would love to see someone come up with visual sketches of what this all could look like. One group that is working at moving New York City away from the automobile is  urlLink Transportation Alternatives .

      It's very late, and my brain is rather mushy after setting this up. So at this point, all I am posting is a little experiment to see whether I can get this whole thing to work. It looks like it might be, and I'm fairly amazed at how easy this whole process is. Though I need to change the layout at some time.

      The Center for American Progress has posted  urlLink A Declaration Calling for the Resignation or Removal of John Ashcroft . I would encourage everyone to read over this declaration and, if they see fit (I did), to sign the petition that goes along with it. John Ashcroft is, as Paul Krugman of  The New York Times  put it in at least two of his columns, the worst Attorney General in U.S. history. His affronts to our democracy are legion, and his performance as our country's top law enforcement officer are abysmal.   There are currently questions swirling around the fact that although he will blast the trumpets whenever a person of color or Muslim is arrested on the flimsiest of charges, he has made not one public peep about the  urlLink arrest in December 2003 and subsequent guilty plea of William Krar , a white supremacist who was caught with automatic weapons, pipe bombs, a stash of cyanide gas large enough to kill everyone in a 30,000 square foot building, and false UN credentials and Defense Intelligence Agency IDs. This man would have been able to carry out the most devastating attack on U.S. soil since 9/11/2001, and our attorney general (along with the vsat majority of our country's media) has completely swept it under the rug. Might this be because Mr. Ashcroft has a history of being supportive of white supremacist groups?  Keep in mind that John Ashcroft was appointed by a president who was illegitimately placed into power by a partisan Supreme Court. Keep in mind also that the people of Missouri so reviled John Ashcroft that he lost his race for U.S. Senate to a dead man.  So let's put John Ashcroft where he'll do us the most good – as far away from government as possible.

      Let me not be charitable towards Ronald Reagan. So many are doing this for him now, and so undeservedly. Yes, it is fine to mourn the passing of another consciousness, though in this case much of that was gone or at least disastrously altered. But to engage in the wholly uncritical historical revisionism that has been going on is wholly repugnant. Even so-called liberal commentators seem to forget that this was a man that stood against everything they themselves stand for and, in the process, against human decency.  For those who would point out that Reagan started out his political career as a labor leader, let us examine his most important actions within the Screen Actors Guild, of which he was indeed president. His most important activity within SAG was to denounce fellow union members and others in the film industry as Communists during the McCarthy era, destroying careers and lives in the name of a hysterical political witch hunt that even conservatives now invoke as a black spot on our history.  This is the man who, as governor of California (beware Californians becoming Presidents), called out a violent National Guard against free speech protestors. This was the man who vetoed a state bill to allow farmworkers to have the simple right of collective bargaining.  This was the man whose people, in order to put him over the top in a tight race for the presidency, arranged for Iran to prolong the holding of US hostages until after the elections so as to further damage his opponent, Jimmy Carter. It is no coincidence that the hostages finally were released on the day of Reagan's inauguration.  Let us not forget, in this time of war on Iraq, that Reagan's administration actively supported the regime of Saddam Hussein, selling him weapons, including the chemical variety. Many of the weapons used against US troops in 1991 and even today had and have US serial numbers on them. The chemical weapons that we helped provide were not only used against Iranian troops during the Iran-Iraq War, in clear contravention of international treaties. They were also used against Kurds during the infamous episode that has been hauled out repeatedly in order to vilify Saddam and justify our waging war on the Iraqi people.  Reagan is most celebrated by his proponents for his supposed victory against Communism and the fall of the Soviet empire. Oh, how we forget about Mikhail Gorbachev and the people of the Soviet bloc! It was the people themselves, without our help, that made change in the Soviet bloc. Let us not forget how surprised our own government, including the CIA (whose track record suggests the "I" should simply be dropped from its name), was when the Berlin Wall fell and the Soviet Union shortly thereafter.  Yes, Reagan did actively fight communism, or what he perceived to be communism. But where did this take place?  In the case of Nicaragua, Reagan's administration violated the very laws of Congress in order to support the Contras, a band of murderous thugs who worked to bring down a democratically elected government. Reagan's "freedom fighters" rarely engaged Nicaragua's military, preferring instead to target civilians in their villages, destroying fields and hospitals and killing hundreds in the process. This strategy was undertaken not only with the blessings of Reagan's administration cronies, but at their urging. And how did we fund the Contras? Ah, yes — with drug money, and arms sales to Iran.  In the name of quashing the communist threat in the rest of Central America, Reagan propped up regimes in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Hundreds of thousands of people died in these tiny countries at the hands of US-trained death squads.  Reagan even conducted an out-and-out invasion of a country in order to supplant a democratically-elected government. As if Grenada would have ever posed a "threat" to the US. And as if it even wished to. Basically, in this case people were killed for a publicity moment, to show that we were big and tough and nobody should mess with us. Especially if they were from small, poor, defenseless countries.   While he didn't seem to like democratically elected regimes, Reagan's record elsewhere suggests he never met a righ-wing dictator he didn't like. From Marcos to Suharto to Pinochet, he and his administration made sure that these blights upon humanity had the backing of the United States of America.  His love of dictatorships extended to the race dictatorship, otherwise known as apartheid, of South Africa. Reagan was not only vocal in his support for the apartheid regime, he actually  vetoed  a bill to place sanctions upon South Africa. Much to The Great Vetoer's chagrin, and our relief, his veto in this case was overridden. And let us remember he labeled Nelson Mandela — yes,  the  Nelson Mandela — a notorious terrorist, along with the ANC, which now rules South Africa. Reagan's policies served to lengthen the time apartheid held sway, and he himself is therefore responsible for the prolongation of death and suffering in that country.   Not that Reagan wasn't active on the home front. Of course he was. Why, under Reagan the homeless population in this country rose from relative negligibility to two million. How's that for making an impression? Reagan also has the distinction of being the president under who the US for the first time became a debtor nation. The massive amounts he spent on weapons, including the nuclear kind, surely aided in that. How ironic it is that vocally "small-government" Republican administrations these past decades have been the ones who have been the most profligate in their spending! Reagan is at the root of this pattern.  This is also the president who took the unprecedented action of firing all of this country's air traffic controllers who had gone on strike. This was not only a blow to the right of working people in the US to organize, but also left our skies much more dangerous by bringing in, en masse, a whole cadre of barely-trained controllers to manage the air lanes.  This is the man who consistently attacked civil rights, and then affirmative action, from the time he was president of SAG to the time he was president of the USA. He even began his 1980 presidential campaign in the infamous Philadelphia, Mississippi, where three civil rights activists ahd been murdered in the 1960s, without so much as acknowledging the incident.  So as people remember Ronald Reagan, we should not only remember the cheerful face, but remember that this face masked a combination of bullheaded ignorance and outright malevolence. Let's remember that this is the man who nearly brought us to the brink of nuclear annihilation with his funny little aside that he had outlawed the Soviet Union and bombing would commence in five minutes. His personal charm masked a hateful boorishness that is reenacted now, more baldfacedly, by George W. Bush.  Ronald Reagan, go away and leave us in peace. And take George with you.

      When I was a child, my parents took me to the Exploratorium in San Francisco. Making even more of an impression on me than an original stand-up arcade version of Pong and simple laser light demonstrations was a curious little device that demonstrated the power of optical illusion. The entirety of this highly sophisticated machine consisted of a foot-diameter black-and-white spiral rotating slowly.  urlLink 60 Second Trip  brings a slightly more complex version of that spiral to your Web browser.  urlLink Little Fluffy Industries  says "This neat optical trick will give you the same trippy feeling you'd get from spinning around real fast," but it's actually much cooler than that.

      An open letter to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (New York City and surrounds) regarding some of their  urlLink proposed new rules :  To the MTA:  I strongly object to the proposed ban on photography in the New York City subway system. This will NOT enhance passenger security or safety. It will do nothing to keep a determined person from using such devices as cell phones, Palm Pilots, and the like from taking pictures. Instead, it will insidiously extend a culture of fear into our transit system. It will prevent passengers and visitors from taking with them a little of the romance of New York City. I have been taking spur-of-the-moment pictures in the subway system for the ten years that I have lived here, and they have been important in showing my friends elsewhere in the US and the world what makes NYC such a great city. Diverting police resources to enforcing a no-photography rule will only keep them from work that truly keeps us safe, and will make the atmosphere more hostile for everyone down below. Please do not play into the culture of fear that the Bush administration wants to impose on us.  I must also object to your criminalization of frustrated passengers who have to deal with your extremely imperfect Metrocard technology. While I have never jumped a turnstile, I would sympathize greatly with those who do so due to a malfunctioning card. I sometimes wonder what real-world testing you actually did with Metrocards before setting them loose on us. I am not opposed to a card-based technology in principle — indeed, I got along famously with the SF Bay Area BART system's cards. But your cards have caused me to miss trains more than once, and because of the often unreliable nature of your train service, one missed train can eventually mean delays of up to 20 minutes, when missed transfers are factored in, during the day. Late at night, the waits can be even more disastrously long. So my suggestion is to get your own technological house in order before criminalizing your paying passengers.  Finally, do not prohibit people from transferring between train cars. I know of many cases when people transfer because a car that they entered is hostile in some way: there is no air conditioning in the summer, there is an especially foul smell, there are people acting in a threatening manner. In addition, people in New York work to squeeze whatever efficiency they can out of the subway system, getting themselves to a car that will leave them closer to a transfer point (see above point) or to their exit. Why not instead come up with ways to make those inter-car transfers safer?  Thank you for your time and consideration, Bascom Guffin Brooklyn, NY

      I just sent the following letter to Roman Catholic Bishop Michael J. Sheridan regarding his  urlLink call to deny communion  to politicians who support issues that violate specific Roman Catholic teachings.   Bishop Michael J. Sheridan The Diocese of Colorado Springs  228 North Cascade Avenue  Colorado Springs, CO  80903   Dear Bishop Sheridan,  I am trying to understand why, in your call to deny communion to Catholic politicians and voters who support abortion, stem cell research, or same-sex marriages, you do not call for the same measures to be taken against those who support the death penalty. As you yourself state, "As Catholics we have the further obligation to give assent to the doctrinal and moral teachings of the Church because 'to the Church belongs the right always and everywhere to announce moral principles, including those pertaining to the social order, and to make judgments on any human affairs to the extent that they are required by the fundamental rights of the human person or the salvation of souls.' [Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2032 and Code of Canon Law 747.2]."  One of these moral teachings reads thus:  "Assuming that the guilty party's identity and responsibility have been fully determined, the traditional teaching of the Church does not exclude recourse to the death penalty, if this is the only possible way of effectively defending human lives against the unjust aggressor.   "If, however, non-lethal means are sufficient to defend and protect people's safety from the aggressor, authority will limit itself to such means, as these are more in keeping with the concrete conditions of the common good and more in conformity with the dignity of the human person.   "Today, in fact, as a consequence of the possibilities which the state has for effectively preventing crime, by rendering one who has committed an offense incapable of doing harm--without definitively taking away from him the possibility of redeeming himself--the cases in which the execution of the offender is an absolute necessity 'are rare, if not practically non-existent.' (NT: John Paul II, Evangelium vitae 56) [Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2267].  What this teaching tells us is that the death penalty, especially as practiced today in the United States, is morally wrong. Why, then, do you not call to account the many politicians who so strongly support the death penalty, especially in the face of a growing mountain of evidence that many innocents have been put to death by the state in this country?  If you think this question smacks of partisanship or particularism (i.e., why single out the death penalty to be against), then mightn't the same be true of your own pastoral letter? Why not simply, in your letter, call for a denial of communion to those who support violations of any of the Church's teachings? This would at least give some sense of consistency and fairness to what you propose.  I look forward to your reply.                  Sincerely,                 Bascom Guffin

      What follows is a wish list of some ways the subways in New York City can become more pleasant. I am putting these down without regard to cost-effectiveness, though if the subway system is more pleasant, there is a good chance ridership, and therefore revenue, would go up:   Make them quieter. What is especially loud and disturbing is the express trains hurtling through local stations. Maybe there are new wheel technologies that could be applied on the current tracks. The Paris Metro runs on rubber wheels. Another option would be to fit ceilings and pillars (including those separating tracks) with sound-absorbing materials. It is possible that there are hard rubbers or polymers that could do this while at the same time being extremely durable and easily washable.   Fix the sound systems. The loudspeakers in the stations sound like tin cans. Coupled with the echo-chamber nature of the stations (see above), this makes announcements at most locations incomprehensible. Make sure that the system is set to the appropriate loudness.   Include digital visual signage for announcements. New York City is far behind almost every other metro system when it comes to this. The signage can normally give the current time, and wait times for trains coming to that platform. It can give announcements about delays or route changes. Up-to-the-minute visual signage is also critical for people who are deaf. By the same token, it should not replace voice announcements, which are critical to blind people.   Daylight stations more. Those with darkening grills that let air in might be replaced by something that allows more light through. Or the ceilingway between the grills and the stations can be modified to allow more light. Utilize plexiglass, metal grilling, and maybe even mirrors to get more natural sunlight into the train stations, and maybe even along the tracks. Along with more sunlight will come lower energy consumption, as well.   Electric lighting should use full-spectrum bulbs, meaning light bulbs that emit the same spectrum of visible light as the sun. Alternately, or as a complement, various colors of lighting can be used in various arrangements to make the lighting of stations and trains more interesting and inviting, while still conveying a sense of comfort and security.   Make them free. This contradicts my argument about revenue going up, although there might be a way to obtain more public moneys as ridership inevitably goes up. Making subways free will eliminate turnstile jams. It will eliminate frustrations with faulty Metrocards, Metrocard readers, and vending machines. Stress levels associated with using the subway system will decrease.   Have personable employees at every station, and maybe every platform, to give information to riders. They could be stationed at small kiosks on each platform, and would also serve as a visible sign of security for riders at all times of the day and night.   Make all stations and trains easily wheelchair accessible. This will not only aid people who use wheelchairs, it will also be a boon to the many people who push carts and baby carriages and the like. And will allow ambulatory people with difficulties walking to get around the subway system more easily. This will also mean less jams on stairways, that now act as bottlenecks trying to get to and from trains.   Make the system much more extensive. Add the Second Avenue line, yes. But also add lines in the Bronx, Brooklyn, and Queens. And not simply all radiating out out of Manhattan. It should be easier to go places between and within boroughs outside of Manhattan.  These measures, and more, would make people's subway experience more agreeable, and possibly even pleasurable, and would go far toward upgrading the quality of life in New York City.

      Nelson Mandela, icon for those who value freedom, compassion, and humanity has announced that he will effectively be  urlLink retiring from public life . This is a sad day for all of us. I wish him well as he finally takes time to be with his family and himself. We salute you, Madiba, for all that you have done for us and inspired in us, the world over. May you live to be 115, always in good health. Amandla!

      Paul Krugman  urlLink writes today in  The New York Times  : "Bush campaign ads boast that 1.5 million jobs were added in the last 10 months, as if that were a remarkable achievement. It isn't. During the Clinton years, the economy added 236,000 jobs in an average month. Those 1.5 million jobs were barely enough to keep up with a growing working-age population." This says a great deal about how our economy is doing - times are not getting any easier for working folks (and especially for folks who are trying to  find  work. So much for the miracle-generating powers of Bush's tax breaks (you know, the ones that have made rich folks richer and put us as a nation trillions of dollars in debt). This is just one more example of why we should look skeptically at every single word that comes out of the Bush administration's collective mouth.
