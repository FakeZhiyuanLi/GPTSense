      The grand opening at the Banana Republic outlet was better than I thought it would be. 30% off everything! I bought a lot of stuff. I like their clothes because they fit really well, and the material is really good. The lady at the cash register tried to get me to open a Banana Republic credit card, and I was really tempted to get one. She could see me wavering. But no, I had to be strong. I have too many credit cards and not enough money, hehe.  Maybe we'll go back to the outlets tomorrow! ooooooooooh.

      I rented this movie because I had heard that the acting in it was superb. But I had no idea that I would be so moved by the story. It's not really a simple "story" but rather a look into the bond two people can have, the strengths and weaknesses of humans, and the circumstances with which different people cross our paths... I like Roger Ebert's review in which he says, "we have seen good people with good intentions who have their lives destroyed because they have had the bad luck to come across a weak person with shabby desires."  I won't go through the whole movie, but as I write my thoughts, the plot will probably reveal itself, so if you want to watch the movie and not know what happens, you should probably stop reading.  I must admit that throughout most of the movie, I had more sympathy for the Behrani family than I did for Kathy (Jennifer Connelly's character). After all, it was through Kathy's lack of responsibility that her house was seized. I understand that it must have been really upsetting that her husband left her. In fact, she was devastated. But is it too harsh to say that we can't stop living our own lives? That we still live in this world, whether we like it or not. Life will go on around us, and it is up to us not to let it pass us by? Or at the very least, open our mail and not live in squalor. Meanwhile, Behrani has been working day and night with two jobs so he can purchase this home for his family.   But the circumstances with which Kathy lost her house were pretty asinine. I mean, $500? That's it? Come on, that's nothing to lose a house over. But that wasn't the fault of Behrani. If I were Kathy, I'd be pretty pissed too.   One of the thing that really struck me was how both Kathy and Behrani admitted that they made a mistake. Kathy keenly felt that she screwed up. Her father worked for 35 years to purchase this house and she managed to lose it in 8 months. And Behrani was man enough to admit to son that he was wrong and probably should have sold the house back for the price he had bought it.  You can tell that both parties are good people. Beharni's family treated Kathy with kindness and respect even though she was trying to take away their home.  Tragedy befalls everyone because of Kathy's boyfriend who Behrani instantly recognizes as weak hearted. The boyfriend is a cop who uses his power to bully the family and his fear to close his eyes to the truth. Even after there seems to be some sort of truce between Kathy and the family, he disregards everyone's wishes and goes on his own power trip agenda.   When Behrani's son got shot, I just started to weep. He was innocent in the whole thing - just trying to be a man like his father always wanted him to be, protecting his father and family... After his son was taken away, Behrani just repeated over and over "I want only my son, I want only my son." And you just knew that he didn't care about the house. He prayed to God that he would give everything away, if only he could have his son. After his son died, I wondered how Behrani would break the news to his wife because it was just *crush* her. She would feel as if she had nothing. Behrani knew that this was *exactly* how she was going to react, and the fact that I knew this too is an amazing testament to how the movie reveals its characters. So instead, he never tells her, and as soon as I understood what was going to happen, I also understood that there was no other way. Behrani's wife seemed to know what was going on too, you could just see it in her eyes.   Kathy's grief when she finds their bodies felt so real. You can see the grief and guilt consume her. And even though I didn't feel as much sympathy for her for losing the house, I did feel that it wasn't all her fault, that everyone had a part in this. And... perhaps the fact that she was the only one left to live with this pain deserves the greatest pity of all.

       President Bush insisted Thursday that Saddam Hussein had "terrorist connections" to Al Qaeda — despite a finding by the commission investigating the Sept. 11 attacks that there was no credible evidence of cooperation between the ousted Iraqi dictator and the global terrorist network.     Commission staff investigating the Sept. 11 attacks announced Wednesday that they had found "no credible evidence" of cooperation between Hussein's regime and Al Qaeda in targeting America or its allies. A senior CIA analyst and a senior FBI official, both of whom appeared at the hearing, said they concurred with the finding.   Thomas H. Kean, the commission chairman, told reporters Thursday that the panel did not dispute that Hussein's government and Al Qaeda had been in contact. But Kean, a former Republican governor of New Jersey, said investigators determined "that there is no credible evidence that we can discover, after a long investigation, that Iraq and Saddam Hussein were in any way part of the attack on the United States."    In his comments Thursday, Bush said his administration "never said" that the Sept. 11 attacks "were orchestrated between Saddam and Al Qaeda." Bush had first denied that linkage last September, six months after the invasion. His comments then were in response to Cheney's assertion that U.S. success in Iraq would strike at "the geographic base of the terrorists who had us under assault for many years, but most especially on 9/11."    The administration's other prime rationale for war — that Hussein's regime had secretly produced and stockpiled hundreds of tons of chemical and biological weapons and was actively trying to build a nuclear bomb — has largely evaporated. U.S. weapons hunters who have scoured Iraq over the last 15 months have found no evidence to support those claims.       So... even though this bipartisan committee with CIA and FBI say there's no link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda, Bush still says there is? What evidence does HE have? I don't understand how there is SUCH a disconnect within our government with a president basically saying "You're wrong." when presented with evidence from his own government's committee. Then why have the committee in the FIRST place if you were just going to reject all their findings? Gah!

      Today has been such a long day. Started out in Santa Rosa, desperately needing an oil change because I was a 1000 miles past due. Of course, most places don't open at 7am which is unfortunate because I really needed to be in Sacramento, preferably by 8:30. As it was, I left at 8:30, hoping to get there by 10, but alas, I decided to take a "short cut" which it would have been if everyone didn't drive soooo slowly.  Finally made it into lab at 10:15 and checked on my plates. No colonies again. Drat. Well, I couldn't start anything else so I go home, whereupon my PI sees me leaving (it's noon). Gah, so much for a good first impression.  Dentist at 1:30, hopefully my filling won't become loose again. Stopped by the apartment and introduced myself to the landlord who started yelling at me because she didn't know who I was. Apparently no one had informed her I would be moving in. She was quite angry and said she wouldn't allow me moving in, which would have been really bad since I was already packed and ready to go. Fortunately, she calmed down and let me stay but not without giving me a piece of her mind. I imagine a similar fate will meet my subleasor when she gets back from vacation.  Family units came at 4:30 in the midst of me frantically trying to figure out where the UHaul truck I reserved was. Finally, I managed to locate my reservation 8 miles from where I had it reserved. Anyway - I'm getting really tired, but the end of the story is that more chaos ensues before I got finally moved in. Everything is still in boxes but at least it's here. Time to collapse on the bed!

      Well, I don't know why I'm going to maintain two blogs, I suppose I'll use this as more of a photoblog. I got new glasses - I was hoping it would be like Tina Fey's on Weekend Update, but they don't look anything like them... or rather, I don't look anything like Tina Fey. That's probably my problem.

      After a year at xanga, I decided to finally set up a blogspot. It just looks so much prettier! Seems more user friendly too. We'll see - I'll give it a test run. This is Jolene and Bernette's fault! :)

      I'm watching Season 2 of Dawson's Creek and I think the first episode "The Kiss" is my favorite. Granted, I haven't watched all of the seasons of the show, but I know that Joey ends up with Pacey. I like "The Kiss" because it's when Dawson and Joey seem to be the happiest; their relationship is new, exciting, romantic... none of the other complications have happened yet. That's how I like to remember the show.

      I don't know why I didn't think of this yesterday. It came to me as I was feeding my cells. Elaine represents the loss of all of Mrs. Robinson's hopes and dreams. She probably resents her daughter for it - perhaps wants her to be as unhappy as she is? Maybe Mrs. Robinson doesn't want Ben to date Elaine because then Elaine will be taking away *another* thing in Mrs. Robinson's life that makes her happy. oooh that's pretty good.

      Finally got around to seeing this classic. I wasn't sure what to expect, but for all intents and purposes, I was blown away. I thought it was rather revolutionary for a film made in 1967, but I'm not sure if that's a correct assessment since I am quite naive as to the social and political climate of the era. First, the cinematography alone was pretty damn good. It was a well-made movie, plain and simple. Second, I just loved the soundtrack (which is basically a Simon and Garfunkel album). But it just fit the movie soooo well. More than just the words describing what's going on in the movie, the music seemed to embody its spirit. Of course, the acting was superb as well. But in terms of its characters... I just don't understand what Ben's appeal is. He has no identity, no values he can call his own, not that I hold it against him - but I don't understand why Elaine fell in love with him so fast and was willing to forgive him so quickly for having an affair with her mother. But his persistence and determination is admirable.  Which brings me to Mrs. Robinson, who is the most complex and interesting character in the movie. She's in a loveless marriage, and we see a glimpse of her youthful hopes and dreams and how they've come to a bitter end. She's a strong woman, who seeks out her happiness. In fact, she's so complex, I am still not quite sure why she got so flared up when Ben started talking about Elaine. Is it because, as she said, she doesn't think Ben is good enough for Elaine? Is it because of jealousy and competition? Does she even love Elaine? Does she want to protect her daughter? It's quite perplexing.  Anyway, I found the movie fascinating and pretty funny too. I heard they're doing a remake with Jennifer Aniston - interesting...

      I got to lab at 11am today. That's probably not a good trend. Oh well, I stayed until 5. 6 hours is pretty good. It was a little frustrating today because I've been having trouble making agar plates (I don't know why!). The first time, somebody autoclaved my flask without my knowledge. It was all solidified by the time I came back. The second time, I *thought* I was making LB broth, but apparently I used LB agar instead because the contents of THAT flask solidified too. I wondered why the color was so funny for LB medium. The third time, I did not mix the agar with water well enough because it didn't dissolve in the autoclave. Just big clumps of burnt agar, which I poured out into a bucket, waited for it to solidify, and trashed. The fourth time, I ran out of agar - so I just had to make a really small batch. Thankfully, it worked, and I hope my 10 agar plates will last me a very long time.  Then I came home and had spaghetti wrapped in bread. Talk about carb-loaded. I tried to take a nap, but it was too hot. Ate more spaghetti, then came downstairs to get away from the heat. I lay on the floor of the living room staring at the ceiling for quite some time. I thought that was a bit pathetic, so I proceeded to reorganize my Netter's anatomy flash cards, taking us to the present moment.
