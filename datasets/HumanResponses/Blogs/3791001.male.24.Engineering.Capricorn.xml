      I'm tired...have been all week.  I hope I don't come off as a serial bitcher in this blog, but it really bugs me that I sleep 7-8 hours a day, and find it almost impossible to get up in the morning.  I mean, shit, I'm waking up so that I can watch Wimbledon!  What the hell???  This morning was really awful..it's as if it's physically painful for me to get out of bed.  If I was so damned annoyed by the sound of my alarm, I totally wouldn't get up at all.  Maybe I should go to bed earlier, but still, I might as well tattoo a giant "L" on my forehead if I go to bed at 9:30 PM.  SO..anyway..this really isn't going anywhere.  It's depressing to be tired all the time, but if you don't get enough rest, depression can set in.  So which happens first?  Or is it a vicious cycle thing?  How does one break out of it, if at all?

      On my webpage, www.samkeen.net, I'll soon be posting a calendar feature so that I can keep up with my tennis schedule online.  Hope to see you on there soon! :)

      So I woke up this morning, which was VERY hard to do for some reason, to watch Amelie blow the second set against Suarez.  Keep in mind that I *really* like Suarez, she has a fun little compact game with some outrageous strokes, and she is fun to watch.  Amelie is my girl though..not only is she a fellow homo, but she wears her heart on her sleeve and plays a gritty, tenuous game.  She reminds me a bit of my hero, Todd Martin.  Amelie pulled it out against Suarez and faces Serena next...ouch.  Hopefully she'll pull through, and I'll have an angst-filled final featuring Amelie and my other girl, Lindsay Davenport, who will probably defeat the blondie Maria Sharapova.  On the mens side, cute Croat Mario Ancic put Tim Henman out.  Tim didn't seem to have the fire that he needed to compete in this match, and as such didn't get a set off of the youngster.  I'm glad Ancic won, because Roddick/Ancic is a mouthwatering Semi.  On the other side, we're still waiting for the results, but I'm hoping for Hewitt/Grosjean, though the good money is on Federer and Sebastian to make it through.

      It would be quite nice in a way to leave my job.  I have well over 80 hours of vacation built up, and I would be compensated for that time, so I could leave here on July 16th and not miss a stride until August!  The downside is, I would really enjoy that ~$2,200 bonus that I would get if I just collected my vacation and went directly to my next job.  Soooo..that's the situation...the president of the company will be here Friday, and it would be kinda cool on my part to put in my notice in person.    It would ROYALLY screw my main project manager though, so I don't want to do that.  We shall see, I guess.

      How could anything so full of action be so dull?  I'm referring of course to my job..consulting sucks, never do it kids.  The pay sucks, too.  Today I'm making reports, literally taking new binders, putting covers, spines, etc. on, then shepherding the actual INFORMATION into the books, which you would think would be the hard part, but it's really not that bad.  I think the reason I don't like this is that I'm not challenged or piqued by this job anymore...I want to have contact with clients, talk to people about their problems and provide solutions, and generally build my client base from the ground.  Around here, there's no time for that anymore, and it makes me sad.  Sooo...I'm leaving.  I'm actually considering putting my two weeks' notice in this Friday, making my last day here July 16th.  Problem is, I almost certainly will not have a job at all, and certainly not the Continental job, by then.  I'll post more about Continental later.

      Things are getting hot in here.  Air Toxics Ltd. (ATL) made a great offer, and it's eating at me, because I know that it will be one of the hardest things I've done in a while if I let it go for the chance at something better.  However, Continental Airlines is stepping up, which is a GREAT sign, I admit.  The secretary to the Director of Environmental Affairs has called me twice this morning to set up my "second interview" with them.  Problem is, I need them to decide by Monday, noon, CST (my drop-dead date is Monday, 2 PM, CST with ATL).  I'm not sure they can do that, but at least they can tell me what kind of a chance I have, or if there's no chance at all, after Interview #2.  Wish me luck!  More posted as I know more, as always.

      ...at Noon PST (2 PM here) is my drop-dead deadline to let Air Toxics know my decision.  Not great, but what I expected as far as a negotiation ploy.  I guess I'll call Continental tomorrow and see if there's any way to move me up that far, but I'm guessing there isn't.  Damn.

      Air Toxics was a bit skeptical about waiting...and Continental didn't divulge much except the fact that they are moving soooo slow in their process...so I'm still up in the air.  ATL's ability to wait will be the key here.  ..still developing...

      So...Air Toxics made a GREAT offer yesterday.  The problem is, Continental is taking it's sweet-assed time getting back with me for a second interview. DAMMIT!  I don't want to dick around too long on Air Toxics, obviously..but I feel like Continental is right for me, so I want to take it to whatever conclusion it comes to.  What the hell do I do now??!?!  I called the Director of Environmental Affairs at Continental this morning to discuss things with her...they haven't even finished their first-round interviews yet (!), but she assured me that I'm on the list for a second interview.  She was very reluctant to tell me anything more, and I didn't want to push her any harder than I already have.  I think I managed to move myself up on her schedule, but that's about it.  I think I can buy time til July 14th or so with Air Toxics, but that's about it.  I'm thinking this way:  the start date for Air Toxics as they have proposed it is Aug. 1 (actually, Aug. 2 is a Monday).  Why not decide things on July 16th?  The Air Toxics offer did not include any benefits information, such as vacation, sick leave, health insurance premiums, and all of that crap, so I need to get info on that anyway, and I could take a week to mull it, right?  Hehee....mullet.  Anyway, so I'm fucked.  I wish Continental wasn't so pokey about getting around to their second interview.  How many people are they interviewing, anyway?  Jesus, what the hell takes so damned long?  Frustration sets in....  I'm taking the 16th off too...dammit, I wanted to be here to give my two weeks' notice.  Dammit!  Thoughts? Suggestions?

      Wow...I'm exhuasted.  I still don't feel up to 100%, though I think it's just fatigue manifesting itself physically.  Emotionally and mentally I'm fine...I just feel worn out!  Maybe I should go home and take a nap, then see if I feel like my workout this evening. :)  The president of my company came by today, and talked with me for a bit.  He's a great guy, but I know him to be a soother...he'll say whatever he needs to bed down your concerns, and to make you forget why you were thinking of leaving in the first place.  In other words, he's a good president. :)  Anyway, he was quite complimentary to myself and my prospects, though I'm really thinking I don't want to stick around in this industry much longer: the pay sucks (relatively), the hours suck, and you're the bottom rung of the gene pool as far as engineering goes.  "consultant" is Latin for bastard.
