       i juz wanna be isolated for the time being. maybe bcuz i wanna b alone. i haf been getting scoldings inside the house and out of the house. and i am veri veri veri annoyed by the noises now. i really wanted peace. sigh~ things normally will get out of hand.  this is not the problem clinging on me tightly. it is the best-fren relationship btween [sokhwa] n me. it is drifting far far far apart nw. bcuz i dun wanna tok much, i wanted to find a realli quiet spot. i even feel like screaming or vent my anger out at times. well, i dunno wad's in me now, all i want to do now is to be free from scolding for years or even lifetimes. i dun wan scoldings! or worse, i dun even noe why am i being scolded.    today, we are performing in the sch hall for the sch to see. it is for a racial harmony celebration. well, we danced [tuimo]. veri nice and cute. thou ppl dunno hw to appreciate. well, they are immature, wad can u expect from them? speaking of immature, kah wan is one of them. =p kah wan larhs... idiot guy! splashed bandung on my costume. knn~ later the costume kena infested by ants, u'll pay lorhs~   haiz... i tink life is totally difficult for me especially when i sae i wanna be isolated for the time being. especially when i carn find a quiet spot in class! omigod! the worst part is, everywhere is noise. -sigh- hellish sch. the onli place it is peaceful is the bench n tables outside the libarary. wow~ so darn peaceful dere.   aniwaes, i dunno wad is going to happen to the relationship between me and [sokhwa]. bcuz she has no idea that i wanna be isolated for the time being. when i feel that time is right for me to get bck my cartoon character, i will. but hu noes?   i find that i am more and more like my brother. when he was sec 2, he has lots of frenx, bt felt tt he shud b isolate for the time being, he bcame more and more apart from his frenx. now, he is on bad terms with his frenz, which i definitely do not hope for.   i tink that's all i was about to sae bahs~ -tata-
