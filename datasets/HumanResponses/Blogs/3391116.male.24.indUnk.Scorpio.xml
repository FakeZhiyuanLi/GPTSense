      This is an issue that has been discussed ad nauseum for a couple of weeks now, but it's one I feel should be explored even further. Were you "outraged" or "shocked" or even "horrified" at the pictures? If you answered "yes" to this question, I have another for you: Are you really THAT stupid? I think it's funny how easily the majority(of Americans) believe that the American military can do no wrong. Does anyone remember World War II? We placed our Japanese citizens in prison camps on the basis that they "might" be spies. I am certain, of course, that they were all treated with the utmost care and concern. Or how about Vietnam? I'm sure all those stories and pictures of U.S. soldiers raping civilians and killing babies were fabricated. And now we come to this war "Operation Iraqi Freedom". Yet again we see "our boys" torturing people. Don't be shocked by this people, be disgusted. This kind of thing has gone on in (I imagine) EVERY war we've been involved in. Something needs to be done about it. All I'm asking is that people realize that this "horror" is nothing new, and it WILL go on and on in EVERY war unless we take a long hard look at our military.

      hypocrisy(n)-1. The practice of professing beliefs, feelings, or virtues that one does not hold or possess; falseness. 2. An act or instance of such falseness.(this definition brought to you by: The American HeritageÂ® Dictionary of the English Language)      Now I know(not really)what you're(the one person who stumbles on this blog by accident)thinking..."Ooooh the first post, and it's already about something as big as hypocrisy!!" Well this IS about hypocrisy, but on a VERY small scale. First off,let me say, I love women. I don't mean in the "I'd have sex with anyone even remotely female" way either. I have a deep admiration for most women, and think that they are EXTREMELY underappreciated. With that being said, let me begin my rant against a small portion of the female population. My problem is this... There are a large number of women who complain that they are objectified in TV and music videos and the such. I agree, COMPLETELY. What I have a problem with are women who argue about their own objectification, while objectifying men(OR other women).A good example of this can be seen in two of the most popular media stars: Vin Diesel and Ashton Kutcher. Both are considered very attractive men, yet seem like they posses the I.Q. of the desk that this computer is setting on. Perhaps I'm wrong. Perhaps they're both Yale grads who graduated at the top of their class...but I don't think so. I think they are attractive, relatively stupid men. These women who find Mr. Diesel and Mr. Kutcher attractive, yet argue that women in the media are only appreciated for their appearance are (What's the word of the day kiddies?)HYPOCRITES. The media is a haven for this kind of behavior. For the most part, only the "beautiful" people become successful. So what's my point? I guess it's that "objectification"(Our other word of the day. Yep, it's my blog so we can have as many words of the day as I want)IS indeed a problem for women. It is also a problem for men that is overlooked and, I feel, socially acceptable when it should not be.

       Let's talk a little fiction (maybe). Let's say, for example, that I produce a substance that is (for the most part)a necessity. Let's say that substance is oil. Let's also say that I will only produce a certain amount of oil, for instance 23.5 million barrels a day. Let's also say that, while I tell you that I am only producing 23.5 million barrels of oil a day, I am actually producing 26 million. Now, if I remember economics correctly, supply and demand play a MAJOR part in this. My problem with all of that is this. If I say I'm only producing 1 barrel of oil a day, couldn't I pretty much charge whatever I wanted for it?Say,for instance, 1 billion dollars a barrel. Couldn't I also actually produce MANY barrels, claiming I am only producing 1 and sell MANY for that price (1 billion)? While that is a very extreme example, I think it makes my point. OPEC has claimed to be making only 23.5 million barrells of oil a day, while ACTUALLY making 26. Aren't they doing just as my example? Aren't they essentially LYING to us about how much they are producing, which in effect makes gas prices HIGHER than they should? Maybe I don't understand it...maybe this is something I am ignorant about. At any rate, this is only MY opinion on it.

        While most people who write about Memorial Day write about someone who has died in service to our country (DUH that's what Memorial Day is about), I'm gonna write about someone else. This someone (as far as I know) never served in the military, but he was one of the bravest people I have ever known. I used to work at a grocery store in a moderate sized city in Indiana(don't let anyone lie to you...there really isn't much more than corn here). The GM at the store was quite possibly one of the greatest people I have had the pleasure to work for. One day, after I had been there for quite some time, I was told by the assistant manager that the GM had brain cancer.He was to have an operation in a few days and would miss work for several months. Of course everyone was in shock and it was a stange place to work for a bit. He went into the operation early on a Thursday.The operation went well and was seen as a success. What to my wondering eyes should appear on Sunday, however? Yes the GM...only THREE DAYS after BRAIN SURGERY!!!!!!! In the following months, things actually changed VERY little. He had to slow down a little at work, and I mean a VERY little. After a couple of months, he discovered that the cancer was worse than thought and had spread all throughout his body. Not too long after that he began chemotherapy. The whole time, never once complaining or anything. He still worked nearly as hard as he always had. Unfortunately, I had to quit my job there and move to a different city. I found out just a few months ago that he had lost his long battle with cancer in November. That news was harder to hear than I would've thought. He was one of the strongest human beings that I have ever known. His courage and dedication during his illness was a true inspiration to me, and I hope it is to others too.
