      well it has finally happened. despite various assertions of "i don't want a relationship" or "i dont want to date her," S has entered into coupleland one step, or maybe three, further. he will forgo hanging with me to be with her. understandably, i'm not putting out, so that is one of the first obvious things. but if it goes deeper, well then like i said, IT has finally happened. ug. nobody breaks plans with me for another girl. and it was suggested that i was welcome along out for the night of drinking and music. but why on earth would i want to do that? no fucking way in hell. i am not going to be a third wheel.  i am so pissed at myself for not sabotaging this a long time ago, when she first asked about him. i thought telling her the full extent of his long-distance girlfriend would stem her interest. but it didnt, as we all know that some people dont care if they are helping someone cheat, or they dont care that the person isnt emotionally available. so she went for it. and now S has dumped the ole gf. not because of this new chick mind you. it was in the shitter for months anyway, but at least it was a distant memory, and easy to forget that his heart was wrapped up in this girl so far away. but now this newest shit is so in my face that i cant breathe.  this bugging me soooo goddamn much has made me realize i need to do a laundry list of things: break it off with N, sabotage S and this dumbass chick, and also tell S how i feel—which actually may just do the trick of him not lasting with her anyway. though i give myself too much credit. i have long been relegated to friend land so there may be no return trip. i see how we are and i know there is more to it than simple friendship, but i think that too much has happened lately for me to say a word and it fare well. what i really must do is bide my time until this runs its course. i cant see him being super into her for the long term. so it may very well run its course as his rebound relationship, i will get thru this shit with N, and then we'll both emerge on the other side. this could all be wishful thinking as well. here i am feeling like my heart is breaking and ironically it has nothing to do with the person i'm dating. i feel like such an asshole.

      earlier today i made the mistake of reminiscing online. i googled a girl i was friends with a few years ago. she is a journalist so her articles are online and she's also in a band that has received some press, so it wasnt hard finding shit about her. she is getting married in september, and she is documenting her search for the dress, cake, etc. in a series of articles for the paper she works for. reading more and more i got so sad, because i remembered back to once upon a time, well two years ago, when she said that i would be her bridesmaid. and now that the day is dawning, i'm not. we dont even speak. we never had a huge falling out, or any falling out actually, so that makes it that much worse—to not know what went wrong or why we no longer speak.  i eventually dragged myself out of the house to go see  urlLink donnie darko , which was rereleased in the theaters a few days ago. the extra footage rocked, and made the movie way more understandable. this is now the fifth time ive seen it, and i pretty much understood everything, but this newest version was still unexpectedly great.  i was the first one to walk into the theater, along with S. he insisted he sit on the aisle, since he's 6'5". of course. no biggie. i plop down next to him but then when i think better of it i turn to him and ask, "oh wait, i guess anna is going to want to sit next to you, right?" (anna is a girl he's been seeing, though not seriously, and she likes him more than he likes her)... his response was, "i dont fucking care." he's over it. but being thoughtful, and conceding, i moved in to accommodate the rest of our friends filing in. damn. this annoyed the FUCK out of me.  afterward, i went with anna (she's my friend too; i introduced them actually) over to some friends' house to have some beers and dinner. it was really nice cuz i hadnt seen them in a long while. our conversation at one point turned to moving out of new york. and i'm all for it. i get that feeling from time to time, and i'm back in that groove. i think its helped along by my failing relationship, lack of steady work and that j and j are moving in a few months. i go back and forth in my head all the time about where i would want to move and if i'm ready or if new york has doomed me to be miserable everywhere else. then there is always S. to consider. if i leave the city anytime soon then there is no chance we'd ever end up together because he lives here.  but anyway, now i'm back at home and all the annoyance i have felt all day has caught back up with me. i'm restless. i'm sad. i dont know what i should do. i think i might want to move from new york. i'm in love with one of my best friends, who happens to also be my boyfriend's friend. i wish ill on people at every turn. and i'm stressed to the Nth degree.  i have never had so much frustration about S before. ive never been jealous or any of that shit. and now its creeping in. i'm realizing that over the past year that we've been friends, i never realized that i love him so much. i know that dating him would be a whole different story, perhaps something that would never really work out. but i dont even think about it on that level. its like shit has transcended that level so long ago. i just love him so purely and simply, i guess because we've been friends for so long. which is great except that its also complete torture. its never been that way before, until last week. and it all hit me. and now i cant get over it. i realized today i dont ever want to be around him and anna together ever again.  the only thing that can at once console me and let me wallow is elliott smith. so i will listen to bled white on repeat till i cant stand it. then move onto independence day.

      jeopardy is about to end its season. and ken motherfucking jennings is still going strong, nearing 40 consecutive days as jeopardy champion and de facto status as "the man" among I.T. dorks across the nation--not that that took much. so what this means is that soon we will be subject to reruns, until fall comes and alex and ken come back from their gay cruise to trinidad and tabago. reruns. that means a whole helluva lot of ken. goddamnit motherfucking sonofabitch asspeckerfaced-dick. i still coulda sworn that when i was in raleigh i saw him get his ass beat. but then he was there, back on top a few days later. the only explanation is that 1. i was fucked up, which was entirely possible, even probable. or 2. after review, it was realized there was a mistake in the judging of answer, which would monetarily change things when added/subtracted so they brought both of them back. i dont know, so i eagerly await that particular episode to see if its wishful thinking or whether someone out there deserves my adoration for their conquest, however fleeting.  so for those of you still uninitiated, you can likelly start from the beginning and see the irritating prick's entire run thus far. as for me, i will be pissed off and plotting how i'm going to get to L.A. to kill this asshole. and while i plot, i will watch. of course.  this is the  urlLink best article  i've seen about Dorky McDildohead.

      directly after work last night i headed to one of our favorite bars to celebrate S's birthday.   halfway into my first beer, the festivities were interrupted by a phone call from N. he was crying and miserable and admitted that he is really depressed and we talked some more about him handling the pain in his life. i really wont bend on how i feel—that i need more than he is giving me. but rather than bailing out right this second, i am willing to stick it out a little bit longer to see if things can change. now that he's aware of how i feel and how he is affecting me, it may be that he takes steps to make things better for the both of us. if not, its splitsville.   i had sucked down 7 cigarettes in a row by the time i finally went back inside. S had gotten completely wasted, which the dexedrine helped that along nicely, i'm sure. one by one, people left over the course of the night, eventually leaving only him and me. we were slurring and falling off barstools, and some woman followed our friend back from the deli and waited outside the bar shouting, "i'm gonna rock you. take that! bitch" and various mumbles. she did a lot of karate kicks into the air in the direction of the door. after about 10 minutes she left. i think she forgot what she was doing there and went to go find more crack. later, when we started riding an abandoned bike with two flat tires down the middle of houston street, we knew it was time to go home.   but the most interesting part of the night came for me out on the sidewalk in front of the bar. there was some guy outside smoking who turns to me and says, "are you from kansas city?" why yes, yes i am. turns out he is too, but that is not the point. "i recognized you... from myspace," he says.  ha! just as i was recently questioning the madness of blogs and seeing someone you have read about online. we chatted a bit about the KC contingent in new york--"there's tons in williamsburg," he said.  the other cool thing about my night was at the mars bar that we met some dude that works at the new york observer and i flat out told him i was going to send him my resume today. "you better," he said. i'm sure people have gotten jobs in wierder ways. better to solicit work from him than the scary woman at the bar last night who jacks off old men for $20 a pop and is so ragged it looks like her face is falling off.  happy birthday to infinity and beyond, bro.  i only got 4 hours of sleep before i had to haul my ass back to the magazine and sit at my desk doing nothing. i have the worst hangover ive had in a long time. nothing is helping, and the mindless chatter of all the prima donnas brings me another step closer to puking.   tonight there is supposed to be another round of birthday drinking, but i think i'm going to have to sit this one out. just the thought of a beer makes me gag.

      ive been seeing this guy for a while now, N, and although he doesnt live in new york, we've managed to do the distance thing just fine so far. seeing as how we both freelance, we can make a point of travelling to see each other often enough to make it work.  when i first got to know him i was intrigued. he's pretty introverted, but unfortunately i think i mistook that for being introspective. it turns out he's afraid of looking at the truth, looking past the surface of people and things, challenging himself, challenging others. i think this is because he's afraid of the consequences. i didnt know this at first, but now its becoming painfully clear, three months into our relationship.  he's dealing with a lot of sad things in his life right now, including the illness of a loved one. that would make anyone pissed off. but he has never found a way to deal with the pain, so it has slowly taken over his entire being and turned him into a scared, sad, angry and bitter man. obviously this does not bode well for him to have a healthy relationship.  so here i am, wondering what to do. we've talked about it, and he cant get past the built-up and day-to-day sadness enough to talk to me, laugh with me, share with me... well, love me. i need more, and he cant give it. the worst thing is that if i break it off, he'll only hurt more. but if i stay in it, i'm just waisting time, energy and emotion.  sigh  its been such a draining day. this is just the tip of the iceberg. i'm going to go get drunk with one of my best friends, S, who i love with all my heart and sometimes think that one day i'll end up with him. S and N are really good friends. how fucked up is that for ya?

      so this morning i woke up especially pissed off and cranky. my left eye is all oozy and gross because of allergies and dust and god knows what else. so thats been annoying me. i decided to completely scrub out and just basically get out of bed, put jeans on and leave the house as is. sometimes that feels liberating.  i made my way up to the avenue and realized that i slept like shit and was so tired that sitting on the nasty pavement while i waited for the bus sounded just fine. so i leaned up against the deli, put my bag in front of me and took a load off. a few minutes later some old polish guy comes walking up the street. when he passes me he drops a folded dollar bill into my bag and keeps on walking, despite my protest of "what? i dont need a dollar!"  honestly though, i didnt have any cash on me. so that was kindof cool. i went into the deli and grabbed a coffee for 50 cents and that fucking rocked.  this is the coolest thing that has happened all day. i suspect it will probably come in a close second to the turkey club i'm going to have for lunch, though. the magazine i'm working at this week buys everyone lunch when theyre neck deep in a special issue. this place is my own personal hell. when they hired me for this particular stint, they expressly told me that i was to not talk to anyone on the staff. if my memory serves me correctly, i never have besides pleasantries such as 'good morning' or 'hello.' such pleasantries, i was told, were also off limits. this is one of the wierder things ever to happen in my working life.  today around the office is particularly amusing, mainly because i must have missed the outfit memo for today. the theme today that ive noticed is some kind of mix between easter-sunday-in-indiana and buffy-from-the-country-club. its all pastel and skirts and even sweaters over the shoulders. its fucking wierd. the wierd thing is that i swear EVERYONE changes styles at the same time. the chicks here rock the worst style ever. tomorrow undoubtedly will be something else that is god awful, perhaps pauly-shore-in-encino-man-meets the-mexican-five-year-old-on-my-block.
