       whenever i read his blog, i become very paranoid...   keep guessing what his blog means...who is he referring to...  wat has happ to him...did he fall in love with someone...   i get very irritable when i dun get to see him for a few days...   i hate to behave like dat...   and worst, she kept pissing me off...maybe becoz they are both capricorn....   perhaps i am the one who cause misery to every1   will he ever be concern abt me...   told him my problems...send me "why?"...no reply after that...WTF...   i dun mind being fooled around by him at all...as long as i get to see him...   silly, stupid, naive....watever u call dat...   i last saw him on 17/8, 4 days already...i miss him alot...   is he thinking of me? haiz...he will call if he really does...   can someone get him out of my mind...   my inferior complexity is getting worst....   i am ugly, fat, ignorant, bossy, irritating, good at nothing, useless...and any other bad traits u can think of....   name it, i have it...

         For  SKY :        INSTALLING LOVE  Tech Support: Yes Ma'am... how can I help you? Customer: Well, after much consideration, I've decided to install Love. Can you guide me though the process? Tech Support: Yes. I can help you. Are you ready to proceed? Customer: Well, I'm not very technical, but I think I'm ready. What do I do first? Tech Support:  The first step is to open your Heart . Have you located your Heart ma'am? Customer: Yes, but there are several other programs running now. Is it okay to install Love while they are running? Tech Support: What programs are running ma'am? Customer: Let's see, I have  Past/Hurt,  Low Self-Esteem, Grudge and Resentment running right now. Tech Support: No problem,  Love will gradually erase Past/Hurt  from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, but it will no longer disrupt other programs. Love will eventually override Low Self-Esteem with a module of it's own called High Self-Esteem. However, you have to completely turn off Grudge and Resentment. Those programs prevent Love from being properly installed. Can you turn those off ma'am? Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? Tech Support: With pleasure. Go to your start menu and invoke Forgiveness. Do this as many times as necessary until Grudge and Resentment have completely erased. Customer: Okay, done! Love has started installing itself. Is that normal? Tech Support: Yes, but remember that you have only the base program. You need to begin connecting to other Hearts in order to get the upgrades. Customer: Oops! I have an error message already. It says, "Error - program not run on external components." What should I do? Tech Support: Don't worry ma'am. It means that the Love program is set up to run on Internal Hearts, but has not yet been run on your Heart. In non-technical terms, it simply means you have to Love yourself before you can Love others. Customer: So, what should I do? Tech Support: Can you pull down Self-Acceptance; then click on the following files: Forgive-Self; Realize Your Worth; and Acknowledge your Limitations. Customer: Okay, done. Tech Support: Now, copy them to the "My Heart" directory. The system will overwrite any conflicting files and begin patching faulty programming. Also, you need to delete Verbose Self-Criticism from all directories and empty your Recycle Bin to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back. Customer: Got it. Hey!!! My heart is filling up with new files.      Smile is playing on my monitor and Peace and Contentment are copying themselves all over My Heart. Is this normal? Tech Support: Sometimes. For others it takes awhile, but eventually everything gets it at the proper time. So Love is installed and running. One more thing before we hang up. Love is Freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everyone you meet. They will in turn share it with others and return some cool modules back to you. Customer: I promise to do just that. By the way, what's your name? Tech Support: Just call me the Divine Cardiologist, also known as the Great Physician, or, just "I AM." Most people feel all they need is an annual checkup to stay heart-healthy; but, the manufacturer (ME) suggests a daily maintenance schedule for maximum Love efficiency.
