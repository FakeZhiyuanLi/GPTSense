      Dear Friends,   I look back on my life right now and think about what I could have been.  What I couldn't done or where I would be if things were differant.  If I wasn't me.  What if my parents weren't me.  What if I didn't grow up where I did.  What if I didn't choose the friends I have now.  What if I conformed every moment when another human being forced me to.  That's the big one really.  So many people in my life attempted to force me into a certain lifestyle.  Most of which didn't do it out of spite.  They usually felt like they were helping me.  But, how can you help someone you don't know.  To fix a problem, to me, the best way is to gather all the information generally related and search for the right answer.  So to help me, you would have to know what I was about.  What my likes and dislikes are.  What I love to do.  What I hate more than anything.  The things that make me laugh, smile, and cry.  The things I am most passionate about.  My dreams.  Yet, no one seemed to take that step.  Most of those people had some preconceived notion of what I needed and what was the "Best for Me."  So the question I have is what if I believed those people.  What if I said, "Yah your right."  Would I be happier?  Would I be miserable?  Would I have met the people I have known to love as friends?  Would any of you be eceiving this email?  Would I be able to tackle simply things like ACHEIVING and MAINTAINING a steady girlfriend?  Would I even be here?  Yes.    I didn't make it to St. Louis with aspirations of becoming a musician by shear luck.  I didn't pick up my first guitar 2 years ago just because somebody left it there.  I didn't meet the influencial people in my life just because I happened to live in the same town, go to the same school or be in the same room at the same time.  Coincedence?  No way Jose (shout out to my all-spanish speaking trainer at work...Jose:o)  I made it here because this is what I was supposed to do.  I made it here because this was my purpose.  And I continue because I must fulfill my purpose.  I must do what I was created to do.  I can't do anything else.  Because you can't FAKE your life.  You can't be anybody else but, you.  Dave Thomas founder of Wendy's loved his Grandma very much.  She always told him "Don't cut corners in life."  Hence Wendy's square burgers.  It's corny but, it makes a lot of sense.  I can't be anything other than me.  I can't do anything other than what I am here to do.  And I can't let anything that was dealt into my life for a purpose....pass me by.  If I do the super secret drug called "FoxDie" from METAL GEAR SOLID which was injected into my body by Dr. Naomi Campell right before my Spy Mission will go into effect.  (I think I just figure out the girlfriend problem.....)  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   So, This week I saw the best...and worst movies I have seen this year.  It's kind of a tradition really.  Every year within 7-10 days I see the "This movie changed my life" movie and the "I can't believe I just spent money on this" movie.  Last years winners?  Best - American History X (I know I seem to inhibit sloth when it comes to seeing movies when they come out)  Worst - Mummy Returns (we won't speak of this movie.....ever....ever...again)  Back to the point.  The movie of the year for 2002 so far was a movie I have always wanted to see but, end up forgeting every Blockbuster trip.  Dead Poets Society.  Unbelievable movie.  If you haven't seen it...I urge you to.   If you have seen it....watch it again dang it.  A movie like this should be viewed and then discussed until the wee hours of the morning (just before the trip to West Plains.....ok....sorry everyone else...only steven will understand that one.....which reminds me if you ever want to hear a REALLY  funny story....).  You can sit and relate this movie to life as easy as you can munch on a Freeze-Pop.  And....just like Freeze-Pops there are so many differant colorful angles to choose from (except the orange ones of course...they are icky).  The greatest of these though is the ability to realize that your life...is yours.  Not anyone elses.  True there are people in our lives that to guide us but, last time Webster and I were chatting....Guide did not equal control.  The ability to control is so scary to me because it isn't in plain site.  It has disquised itself in such words as "Teach" "Parent" and "Raise".  Have you ever heard the words..."We know what's best for you?"  Even the thought behind that statement thas been constrewd.  The words should be..."We know a bunch of things that are bad  for you and so we are gonna warn you about them."  See the a problem I have with the world today is the same problem that has been happening since it started.  At some point...PEOPLE....STOP....THINKING.  They get to a point in their life where they say..."well, I have learned everything there is to learn on that subject, so I don't have to worry about it anymore."  That's Cow-Poop.  I am willing to bet everything I own (which really isn't too much) on the reality that Micheal Jordan does not know everything there is to know about Basketball.  That Bill Gates does not know everything there is to know about Computers.  That Kerri Maxwell is Pretty (how did that get in there) But, more importantly....That we DO NOT know everything there is to know about life.  I sure as heck don't.  Have you ever been sitting inside on a rainy day.  You stare out the window watching each drop of water hit the ground.  Imagine what it would be like to be holding your hands out staring up at the sky.  Each drop hitting you as you play.  Freely doing something that has always been deemed not right.  I am not talking rebellion.  I am talking about your mind.  And the fact that it's yours.  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Alright.  We are now starting week three of the Olympics (the truth is I don't really know how long the Olympics have been going on, I have just had t.v. for three weeks :o)  Anyway, in three weeks, this is the ratio of events that have been offered on television for the Olympics:  75%  Figure Skating 10%  Speed Skating 7%  Byatholon (an event which surfaces the question "What does skiing up a hill and shooting a gun have in common enough to be in the same catagory?") 6%  Curling (I won't even start...)  And one Hockey Game  One  ONE!!!  I have seen one Hockey game and more Figure Skating events than Baldwin Brothers.  In praying to the Lord and asking what I had done to deserve this...the answer was quite clear.  There are TOOOOOO many catagories in the Figure Skating event.  So in order to even things up I have come up with some new "Hockey-related" catagories that should be added to 2006's Winter Olympics.  1.  MIDGET HOCKEY.  Anything with a 'little person' is entertaining.  2.  MUTANT LEAGUE HOCKEY.  Every guy remembers that wonderful Sega Genesis game.  You don't like the ref?  Kill him. :o)  3.  WHO'S HOCKEY IS IT, ANYWAY?  A combination of Hockey and Who's Line Is It Anyway?  Drew and Friends play normal hockey but who ever has the puck has to pretend like they are a chicken who just recently was beheaded.  The Rules are all made up and the Points don't matter and two MVP's from each team have to do the "Ho-Down" at the end of the game to a profession the  audience yells out.  4.  EA SPORTS OLYMPIC HOCKEY FOR PS2.  Finally boys, all those years of practicing will pay off as you go to UTAH to win the Gold.  Warm up your fingers....  5.  MOM ANNOUNCERS.  The same normal hockey except we get two Mothers to announce.  We will get MUCH more T.V. time with catch-phrases like, "Another touchdown by the blue-shirt guys.", "I think them two boys should just sit down and talk things out over some milk and cookies.", and the famous, "Well, I don't know what kind of house he grew up in.  I bet he would think twice about hitting that boy with his stick if Momma came down there and stuck this shoe up his ass."  6.  TACO BELL STEAK QUESADILLA HOCKEY.  I am just really hungry right now.  7.  WOMEN'S HOCKEY.  What?  They have that?  Really?  Wow...  8.  PHOTON BALL.  Roll of toilet paper soaked in Kerosine.  Light it and play dodge ball with it.  It has nothing to do with Hockey but......it's better than watching Elvis Stoyko's big nose.....again.....  9.  REVENGE HOCKEY.  Two teams.  Team one:  Team USA.  Team two:  Team Taliban.  10.  CHUCK-A-PUCK HOCKEY.  This sport is just like normal Figure Skating event except for one new addition.  You guessed it.  All the fans get unlimited supply of Chuck-a-Pucks to throw for the duration of the event.  It's gonna be a little hard completing a Triple Axel with 10,000 black round biskets flying at you at high speeds.  Heh Heh  I ask that you pass this on to the Olypmic Creativity Board and offer Good Luck to TEAM USA in the Hockey Division.  Good day...and God Bless  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      DEAR FRIENDS!  Ok.  I am gonna try and be calm.  As you can tell by my subject title I am....somewhat.....excited.  Please, friends, please....try to understand that something has just been made available to me that I have stayed up nights wondering, just how amazing it would be.  At 21 years old, this is one of the few (I know...the few?) things that I constantly daydream about in a childish manner.  I have accomplished every task there was:  Recordings, Television, Internet Research, Literature and so much more.  Each day, I moved closer to the real thing.  I have been patient.  I have been humble.  I even gave up a blue Pop-ice to a friend and settled for an....ick....orange one.  But, now.  All my hard work and dedication and waiting and (obsession?) has payed off.  Today.....  I found out that Dave Mathews is going on tour in April.  One of the tour dates.  Rosemont IL.  Right in the center of my hometown and my family.  Oh yah.  That's right.  I am going to see Dave Live.  The dates.  Either April 26th or 27th.  Preferably the latter since it is a Saturday and I do believe that there is a soul out there who made a "promise" to go with me.  (not that I am guilting you or anything Kerri...oops I mean....anoynomous:0)  Today is a great day.  I....now....will go do a "Happy-dance" that somewhat resembles the one portrayed on the old sit-com...."Perfect Strangers"  God Bless....and Good Day.  P.S.  I bet you guys thought I got a record contract or something...heh heh...  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   So I used to have this old, ragedy Seseme Street blanket.  It was the most comfortable blanket I have ever owned.  I mean, I have been through blankets.  Big ones, small ones, soft ones and rigid.  Comforters and quilts.  Fuzzy blankets, and plain ones.  Flowers, sports teams (this is starting to turn into a CAT IN THE HAT book).  Anyway, my point is out of all blankets I nesstled in, the old ragedy Seseme Street one was the best.  But, then one day something happened.  I don't really know how or why or really even when but, my Seseme Street blanket was gone.  Gone in a way that at first I thought I could find it but, soon matured enough to realize that  the union between us would never materialize.  The blanket was gone.  So maybe I could find a new Seseme Street blanket that is identical to the old one.  But that too, I realized, was a lost cause.  See that Seseme Street blanket, my friends, had it's own place in my life.  But, that time is over now.  It will be always cherished and remembered.  I will look back at all the good times I had with my blanket.  The times I used it as a cape pretending to be Superman (last year).  The nights I curled up in it's arms.   The soft touch of a item that embraced me in times of need.  And sometimes even when I didn't need it.  The fact is my blanket WAS a memorable life  partner.  But...this weekend....I found a new blanket.  A blanket that may seem similar to the last but, a blanket whose time is now, nonetheless.  My new blanket.  How happy am I?  The answer....extremely.  Love ya guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Well howdy everybody.  This weekend was a good week.  I got to see a lot of my friends.  One especially good friend I got to see was Kris Jarvis.  We sat and joked about a lot but, the most women and the fact that none of them interested us at this particular time in our lives.  (First Disclaimer:  This letter is not meant to be sexist)  So anyway, we got this idea that now before we date anyone there should be an application to fill out.  Of course the first thought I had was, "What a great Dear Friends idea."  So here we go...  ANTHHONY DORIA'S DATE APPLICATION  NAME ____________ AGE    ___________  (UNDER 18 NEED NOT APPLY)  HAVE YOU BEEN ENGAGED TO BE MARRIED MORE THAN 3 TIMES?  HAVE YOU HAD MORE THAN 5 PREGNANCY SCARES?  DO YOU HAVE AN EX-BOYFRIEND WHO TREATED YOU BAD BUT, YET YOU CAN'T SEEM TO BREAK IT OFF FOR GOOD?  (IF YOU ANSWERED YES TO THE LAST THREE QUESTIONS, DO NOT PROCEED, WE HAVE MADE OUR DECISION.....UH....WE'LL CALL YOU :O)  DISCLAIMER #2:  PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES ARE NOT IMPORTANT BUT, UNDERSTAND THAT I AM A AVERAGE BUILT, 5 FOOT 6 INCH, 160 POUND MAN.  A 300 POUND, 7 FOOT TALL, AMAZON GAL IS NOT NESSECARILY WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR :O)  ARE YOU ABLE TO LISTEN?  ARE YOU WILLING TO GET TO KNOW ME?  ARE YOU WILLING TO SHARE A FRIENDSHIP WITH ME, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE OUTCOME OF OUR DATING PROCEEDS TO?  WOULD YOU GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO DO SOMETHING NICE FOR SOMEONE ELSE, EVEN IFIT MEANT MISERY FOR YOU?  WHAT IS MORE IMPORTANT?  FAME OR FORTUNE?  DISCLAIMER #3:  THE ABOVE QUESTION WAS A TRICK QUESTION.  NEITHER IS IMPORTANT.  REAL HAPPINESS IS MOST IMPORTANT, HOWEVER IT IS ACHEIVED.  THE KEY WORD IN THIS DISCLAIMER IS "REAL", WHICH BASICALLY RULES OUT DRUG AND ALCOHOL USE AS A SUBSTITUTE OF HAPPINESS.  IT ALSO DENIES MONEY OR SUCCESS EQUALLING HAPPINESS.  IF YOU THINK THAT YOU MOST SPEND YOUR LIFE WORKING MISERABLY FOR 40 YEARS TO FINALLY BECOME SUCCESSFUL AND THEN WHEN YOU HAVE ALL YOUR MONEY AND ALL YOUR MATERIAL POSSESSIONS THAT YOU WILL FINALLY BE HAPPY THINK AGAIN.  REMEMBER WHEN YOU DIE, YOUR BRAND NEW 01 Z28 IS NOT COMING WITH YOU.  (GEEZE THAT WAS A LONG DISCLAIMER!)  ARE YOU CONFIDENT WITH YOUR LIFE?  DO YOU LIKE TO CUDDLE?  (IF NO....WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU!)  AND NOW WE GET TO THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION....  ARE YOU READY FOR A MATURE, FUN AND INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP?    I CAN'T TELLYOU IF IT WILL LAST OR IF IT WILL WORK AT ALL BUT, I CAN PROMISE YOU THESE THINGS,  I WILL ATTEMPT TO TREAT YOU AS WELL AS I AM PHYSICALLY AND MENTALLY ABLE I WILL BE ROMANTIC, CRAZY, SERIOUS, LOVING, CARING, AND SHARING MOST OF ALL, I WILL BELIEVE IN YOUR DREAMS, YOUR GOALS, AND YOUR IDEAS AND ALL I ASK IN RETURN IS YOU DO THE SAME.   That's it my application.  I might have left a few things out but, that's what the interview is for right?  So, for the few applicants out there, fill it out, get it back to me and hey we will see what we can do.  Oh yah, almost forgot, one last disclaimer...  Disclaimer #4:  If you are Jennifer White and you just so happen to want to fill out the application.....don't bother.  I will hire you on the spot!  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,  For all my new buds that were just added to the dear friends letter list I say welcome.  I also say that this summer will never be forgotten (especially Alison's gorgeous hair).  Anyway....Welcome to "Dear Friends."  It's a wonderful little letter that I send out to all my email buddies.  I talk about something weird that's brewing in my head (which should scare most of you) in hopes that you will all email me back.  Usually it doesn't work which is cool but, atleast I can "brighten your day" for a few minutes as so many have put it.  So anyway......now I have to brighten your day I guess.  So I guess I will tell you a joke.  Um.  Two Italion guys and a Cajun guy live in a small town.  All three of them have a dream to be Nup-makers (Nup = the little plastic peice on the end of your shoelace)  So they all decide to save up their money and move to the Nup Capitol of the World......Delaware.  (I told you it was a joke)  Anyway, they start off working at a Nup Warehouse mass producing (is that supposed be hyphenated?) mass-producing Nups faster than the eye can see.  They made the best Nups in the World but, the problem was no one would buy them and they couldn't figure out why.  The first Italion asked the second Italion (the smelly Italion), "Why won't anyone buy our nups?"  The Second Italion tried to answer but, just trailed off into a boring story that had no point (sound familiar?).  The Cajun jumped  in and said, "I went to college to sell Nups it's the only thing in the world I want to do."  The first Italion tried to find out why, after following what they thought was their dream, they are so unhappy?  Then it hit him.....Maybe he is making Nups for the wrong color shoelaces?  I mean, until this point they have been making Nups for Yellow and Orange and Red strings.  Mabye it was time for him to start making them for strings with the colors of blue or purple?  "I believe that life is a big maze and everytime you find a door that you think is the end it just means you are in a new part of the maze but, you always have to remember....there is always a way out."  The Cajun figured this out very quickly but, the Smelly Italion didn't catch on.  The the three went there seperate ways.  The Cajun stayed making Yellow, Orange and Red Strings.  The Smelly Italion tried selling Grey strings but, no one in the world cared.  Then there was the first Italion.  He packed up his bags and decided to search for a company that made Blue and Purple Strings.  If some of you have sorta figured out all the symbolization used in this story, let's hope that it comes true someday.  If, after reading this, you want to tell me that in no way did I have a clear and conscience thought and you think everyone is now stupider just by reading it I say to you my friend.........."A simple wrong would have been alright but.....okay."  Love you guys,  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,  So it's been a while....The reason being?  I have been sleeping.  Lots of sleep is required when you work with kids all day in the sweltering hot sun.  Confused?  I will clue you in....this week I started my job as a CAMP COUNSELOR at the YMCA.  Wow what a trip.  I have spent about a week here at work and all I can say is "wow, what a trip."  Don't get me wrong.  I love kids.  I will always love kids.  I have some sort of special light inside me that turns on when ever there are children around.  The amazing part about Summer Camp is how it inhibits it's own world.  I feel like when I put on my Gawky Yellow Shirt and step out into the Pavelian, (wow i have no clue how to spell that one) I am in a whole new life, a whole new dimension.  13 Counselors who are the very best friends.  110 kids who each has their own story, their own problem, their own life.  So many things go on at once but, when 4:30 comes around it all disapears.  Everyone goes home back to their own lives, then show up the next day and start all over again.  In one full day of camp I deal with:  An aggressive child who likes to beat people up. A child who WILL not obey the rules even after punishment. A whole group of 12 year olds who already know how to play the game and think it's stupid. A very shy six-year-old who is very upset cause he forgot his goggles in the pool. Talkers Quiters Screamers Cryers Whiners  Every childhood epidemic that you could possibly imagine is going on all at the same time and it is up to me and twelve other young adults (who are poorly underpaid) to organize and keep control of this massacre.  Sounds horrible huh?  I'll let you in on a little secret.  I wouldn't trade it for the world.  Why?  Because.  Because of the laughs I get from the five and sixers when I tell them the wall is falling down and I need their help to hold it up.  Because of the way the 9 year olds think they are so smart when they try trick me with a scam that I tried on the Teacher when I was their age.  Because of Jacob Conover's Mullet.  For the game of MASH I played with Jenny Marlett.  For the way Andre looked at me right before I called his number in Steal the Bacon.  Because of the look on little Christopher Duran's face when I told him I would find his goggles...NO MATTER WHAT.  Because those kids will all remember me for the rest of their lives just like I will remember them.  Just like I will remember the counselors (my friends).....My boss Jill (The crazy lady who teaches me a lot despite what I let on).  I hope it never ends....but, it is destined to....just like anything else good.  Good stuff always has to end sometime or another.  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Have you ever watched that muppets episode where someone's (I don't quite remember who) voice gets stolen and put in a jar.  The whole time everyone is looking for this muppets voice.  That's what I feel I just went through for the last 9 months or so.  Only it's a little differant than losing my voice.  Last year about Aprilish, I lost my sweetness.  Some evil bad-guy stole it and put it in a jar.  Ever since then I have been trying to find my sweetness.  I looked high and low, left and right and no matter how hard I tried I couldn't find it.  I even tried making up some new sweetness but, it just wasn't the same.  You know?  It wasn't vintage ANTHONY sweetness.  So  then I thought, "I guess I will just forget about my sweetness.  Maybe it is gone for ever."  But then I thought, is that what the ScareCrow, Lion and Tinman said when Dorthy was taken away by giant flying monkeys?  NOOO.  They looked into the face of evil, climbed the mountain and saved their little buddy who helped them find Courage....and....Heart....and a Brain.  What that has to do with me finding my sweetness...I don't really know.  (It's not everyday you get to use a "Wizzard of Oz" analogy)  But, I do know this.    Last night, I was walking down a road.  Minding my own business and I suddenly tripped.  After I picked myself up and dusted myself off, I looked down to discover what obstructed my walking.  There, in a little Dill Pickle jar........sat my sweetness.  I picked it up and opened the jar.  Despite the smell of pickles, my sweetness returned to me in an ever-so-delightful way.  I tell you what......I've Missed it.  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends....that are girls,   Alright this is kinda a special Dear Friends letter for all the women out there.  But, don't get discouraged guys.  This letter is also for you too.  Hopefully I will make it simple enough for you to understand because God knows Men are not the most intellectual people in the world when it comes to the opposite sex.  Right girls?  Anyway.  I wanted to tell you guys and gals a story (as I usually do).  It is a story about a little old lady named Bess.  Bess is 82 years old and homeless (I promise this isn't a sad story, just bare with me).  Anyway, Everyone of you today spent time in your lives around Bess.  Maybe you passed her on the way to school.  Maybe on your way to work.  Or maybe on your way to your date with that special someone.  You might have laughed at her.  You might have ignored her.  You might have just not even noticed her.    You might have given her change.  Heck, you might have even helped her up off the street and spent the day with her.  But, see.....this story isn't about helping someone in need.  Although that would be a great lesson to be taught it is not the particualar lesson I am attempting to get across.  As I said, this is a special email for women....and for guys to figure something out.  See, Bess didn't make a couple of good decisions.  She made a few mistakes in her life which led her to her current situation and surrondings  (a fridgerater box and a half eaten Ho-Ho)(I just said "Ho-Ho").  Bess was probably a drunk or addicted to drugs.  Or maybe she was stubborn and refused help from her parents or others that cared about her.  Maybe she doesn't posses an adequate amount of willpower to handle the crap that has been flung at her.  Maybe she had no one there to offer an umbrella.  But, again.  This is not a story about help the less fortunate.  I only reiterate this point excessively because I want all of you to look beyond the commoness of a "guilt you into being good" story.  I want you to look beyond the made for t.v. Sunday Night movie.  I want you to look beyond the tool that people use to deceivingly aquire self-righteousness by publically becoming a good Samaritan.  As you walk by Bess....and she looks up at you with those tired withered brown eyes.  I want you to realize that Bess is special...simply......because she is a woman.  That's it.  Not because she accomplished some amazing feat.  Not because she devised a plan to change the world (I just saw "Pay it Forward").  No it's simple....she is special......because she is a woman.  And so are all of you.  Each one of you have been special to me in my life at some point.  And I thank you for it.  I thank you by saying....."Happy Valentine's Day".  So guys.....if you haven't figured it out by now.....just give up and get her some candy....  I love you guys....and gals  oh....and Happy Valentine's Day Bess  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,  So I am working at the YMCA in O'Fallon now.  It's pretty fun, so far in my "training" I have worked out, been stuck in a room with 12 hot women, played various tough games like kickball and steal the bacon and been fed Subway, doughnuts and bagels.  I have to say, sarcastically I might add, I have my work cut out for me in the summer.  (sorry to all of you that have sucky jobs)  Anyway, the worst (there is a worst part I promise) part about this job is the training you have to endure before hand because of one simple reason......it's just like school.  See for me school was made up of this formula:  5% of teachers that have a legitimate passion for their work 10% of teachers that don't nessecarily have it all down, but they get the job done 85% of teachers that don't have any idea of what the hell they are doing  Of course those 85%, also are the same teachers that think they are the best teachers in the world.  I had a teacher once, for 2 months straight that gave us a book of english questions and answers.  Everyday she would tell us to read the questions, answer them and then check ourselves.  After she read the directions, she would leave for the length of the class hour?  When I decided to bring this to her attention, she told me she was an excellent teacher???????    What I wanted to tell her was, "See the main word in 'teacher' is teach.  Which is the verb that you should be expressing when you inhibit the name 'teacher.'  And since you have to be physically present to actually teach someone...I disagree with your last remark."  The only thing she taught me that year was one lesson:  When you have work to do, find something to do it for you and then leave!  Great "Teaching."  (that was sarcastic again)  This whole world has gone to crap because the real meaning behind our life goals have been lost.  To be a teacher:  To shape and prepare the mind of a child before he/she is thrown out into the real world.  Teachers have to understand that No class, No book, No lecture, No internet newsletter can show you step by step on how to teach a child.  They can give you a good idea but, the only way you are gonna know how to teach little jimmy is to involve yourself into his life and when your time of teaching is over hope and pray that you made a differance in his life.  Implanted a memory in his head that he will never forget.  Lesson plans are guides NOT unbendable rules and regulations......!  Breath in Breath out Breath in Breath out  Wow, I just read what I wrote and realized why I had my own special desk in detention.  I can get a little awnery (  Anyway, So camp is cool, Lot of hot women, Subway, Kickball...  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Video Games are funny.  Nothing else on this earth requires this much thinking, problem-solving, memorization and plain ole intellegence and, for that matter, recieves it without any resistance whatsoever.  Would you like an example?  Gladly.  I took Calculus in High School and although I don't really remember how to turn a Derivitive into a Intergral I can still to this day remember the code to get 30 lives in the NES version of Contra...  Say it with me boys "Up, Up, Down, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, B, A, Start"  How is it that I can recall the most trivial things such as How to defeat Bald Bull in Mike Tyson's Punch Out but, must study day and night to remember how to conjugate spanish verbs?  It's a travesty (new word, hope I spelled it right).  But, this is not a reflection of the reason why I wrote this 'dear friends'.  Other than the video game connection.  See I was playing my Favorite game of all time, "Metal Gear".  One of the many story lines in the game is Solid Snake (the main character) is injected with a drug called "Fox Die".  After completing the game you come to learn that the only cure for this drug is to, "Live, Snake.  Live."  This concept really didn't become completely clear until about a year later.  See Snake, has goals, dreams, a purpose on this world (yes I know he is just a video game character...bare with me).  Fox Die is created in a way that it lives in your blood cells and goes into a effect the minute you cease your purpose on earth.  The Effect being a massive heart-attack and death.  But, the cool thing about it is, as long as you continue to go after your dreams, your aspirations, your hopes, your goals......you continue to live.  It is only when your life is over that you shall die.  hmmm?  It's only when your life is over, that you shall die.  Sounds like something you would read out of a cookie in China town and add the words, "...In Bed" to.  (take your time)  Anyway.  So what's the running theme of this weeks Dear Friends letter?  I have no idea.  But, I do know this.  In Super Mario Brothers, you can warp to level 4 if you hop up on the ceiling and go past the pipe.  :o)  Love you guys  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends  So me and my friends Roy are talking one day and I made the remark, "Well, I'm not getting any younger!"  We giggled a bit, and then Roy stopped and stared off into a distance.  Now most of you who know Roy understand that Roy just had a thought.  A thought that is gonna require a good amount of discussion.    So Roy turns to me and says, "That would be weird to "Get Younger."  I smile because I know that he is going somewhere with this. He says, "One day, your voice starts cracking.  You start loosing hair on your face.  You start to shrink.  You stop thinking about your career, your life and start thinking about more important things like the new G I Joe's coming out and you even start to wonder if this mysterious "Santa" fellow is even real.  And if he isn't, who is eating them cookies you left out over night?  Then, suddenly, this horrible disease breaks out all over.  Everyone is talking about it.  It seems to be spreading from one person to the next like wildfire.  The disease's name........the cooties.  Then pretty soon you forget how to stand and walk, then you forget how to talk.  You try to  tell someone that you just urinated in your pants but, all that comes out is jibberish.  Then finally you find some guy you don't know pushing you into this cave.  The only thing is...the cave opening is way smaller than you but, he seems to not even care..."  Wow.  Roy can be pretty cool sometimes....   Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Well, Well, Well.  I know what you are all thinking.  Anthony's back.  I am  writing you to let you know that it is true.  I am a little more mature now.  I am a little more experienced.  Yet more importantly I am a little more creative and I have a whole lot more boggled up in my head.  So as I have said in the past, I am gonna empty out this noggin on you and hopefully you enjoy the wonderful and crazy yet in-debth thoughts of Anthony J Doria.    So I caught myself today.  Actually I thought about catching myself and thanks to a good friend I was able to confirm the catching of myself.  (yah, I know :o)  See I was playing hide and go seek.  I went and hid from myself and then I started counting to a hundered.  This is a fun game to play with yourself everyonce in a while.  I think it is anyway.  Sometimes it is good to get away from yourself for a couple seconds (maybe a hundered or so).  There are just somethings to remember when you do.  See when you are hiding from yourself, in a sence, you have actually lost yourself.  It is alright to lose yourself in certain things.  Dreams, Love, Career, School, Family, Work.  We all lose ourselves in these things from time to time.  We just cover our eyes, start counting and then go run and hide.  I am guilty myself of hiding in my work.  (Notice I said 'work' and not 'Career', very important)  Now, what I realized while hiding out is the other thing you have to remember when playing hide and go seek with yourself.  You have to remember... after one hundered, you have to open your eyes and go find yourself.  I didn't do that.  When I got to one hundered I just keep counting.  200.  500.  Pretty soon it was seven months of counting.  My mouth was getting dry.  More importantly I couldn't find myself anywhere.  I  looked in my work.  No Anthony.  I looked in my love.  Nada.  I even looked in my dream.  Nothing.  I had run away from myself.  And if you are following at all you are probably wondering why (or what I have been smoking.)  I will tell you why.  I was dissapointed in myself.  Why was I dissapointed?  Because I had neglected myself.  I had neglected what makes me happy.  The best part about playing hide and go seek with yourself is the finding.  Because it makes you (the finder) feel good about keeping yourself on the right path.  But more importantly it also makes you (the findee) feel good because you are not letting you sway off the path.  The path of happiness.  The path that you know if you follow will always bring the doors that supply the entrances and exits to accomplishing your dreams.  So I say to all of you friends, if you started a game of hide and go seek with yourself..... Call Ali Oxen Free.  You are probably worried that you aren't coming to find you.   Love you guys,   Anthony J Doria  "This a new way of doing the Dear Friends for everyone.  In Addition to this I will supply all your old favorite 'Dear Friends' over the next couple of days.  Thanks guys love ya."

      Dear Friends,   I have kind of a weird question.  I know everyone is gonna look at this email with a raised eyebrow but, it was a question that came up at work and I thought I would share it with all of you.  Did George Washington smoke marijuana?  I may not be sure on this but, I don't think it was illegal back then?  I am almost positive the indians did.  They smoked pretty much anything that grew out of the ground.  But, let's think about it no one really deemed it as wrong in that time so who knows who was smoking pot back then.  The lunchroom discussion over this question transformed into a debate soon after.  We as a group (when I say group I mean a warehouse full of people that look like the cast members to Fragal Rock) discussed what thoughts exactly lead to the forbidance of marijuana.  I, not knowing if I was right whatsoever, said that maybe it was because marijuana....as harmless  physically as it is.....can and will control the life of someone who is too weak to control their own.  We agreed that that be a good reason but, then we took it furthermore as I do in this letter.  Think about how many things can control our lives if we aren't weak enough to handle it.  Now go one more and imagine if these things were illegal.  Could you imagine being arrested for being overweight?  How about being charged with the possesion and intent to distribute chocolate?  Let's face it there are a million things in this world...legal and illegal...that can take your life away from you without you even knowing it.  It's at times like this when I like to think about my life and ask the question, "Am I in the driver seat?"  "Or, am I just along for the ride?"  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   You know what?  (I hear the voice of 33 differant people responding with a roll of the eyes..."What")  Certain situations in life are weird.  There are so many differant people out there that I meet a day share one brief moment with and then never speak to again.  I find myself in one of those moments right now.  I sit at a computer...at the public library directly across from a girl about my age.  She has dark hair, brown eyes and perfect teeth.  The reason I know this is because as I sat down we exchanged a smile.  But, that is where it will end.   In a few minutes I will get up and leave.  Or maybe she will finish her work and leave first.  Who ever ends this split second that we sit and dwell upon each other...with what ever attitude we have towards one or  another....chances are we will never see each other again.  Our paths will never cross.  I sit in my chair wondering her age as she sits probably dreaming up a lifestyle that more than likely doesn't resemble mine in any way shape or form.  Somewhere between a minute and three, both aching with the suspence of having to know if the other is interested we both look up again and simaltaniously catch each other stealing one more glance.  One more glance of the girl/guy that we will never know if any type of advancement would come.  Whether I have a girlfriend or she is married we still find ourselves in this brief moment.  Far from justification and rules.  The brief moment that our mind argues over questions like, "Should I say something?" and "I wonder if she likes hockey?"  But as I said...it's a BRIEF moment.  You come.  You sit.  You gawk.  Then you leave.  That is the way the game is played.  It happens 1000 times a day.  Each one of those moments I let pass in and out of my life like they are Flintstone Vitamins.  But, today.  Today I had a new thought.  A thought that might be viewed upon as somewhat irrational.  But, hey.  I am an irrational guy.  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria  P.S.  Her name is Ashley.

      Dear Friends,   Ok.  I have to vent my frustrations for a minute (no suprise).  I went to Burger King for lunch today and was flabbergasted (I have always wanted to use that word).  There in front of my was a sign that said, "Cheese flavored fries...25 cents."  I said to myself, "Self....Burger King has just come up with the greatest idea in Fast Food history."  So I ordered some "Cheese" fries and upon recieving my food...to my dismay...I was given regular fries, something that resembled a Macaroni and Cheese packet and a paper bag.  At first I thought it was a childish prank until I read the directions on the bag.  Cheese Flavored Fries.  If you are guessing that they didn't quite taste fanatical you are probably not the weakest link (that was cheesy...more cheesy than those fries though).  So since I was a itsy bitsy teeny weenie yellow poka-dot ba-PISSED OFF...I decided to write Burger King a little memo.  Dear Burger King,  I noticed that you guys are getting a little desperate.  Being an ex-Burger King employee I understand the all-encompassing "McShadow" that has plagued your existence.  But, it is no reason to go off the deep end.  Chicken Whopper?  Now isn't this so called "Chicken Whopper" really just a BK Broiler with a few more McToppings?  Come on guys....your starting to McBuckle under the pressure.  Don't think that by passing off a few unoriginal ideas that you can joop us into dropping an obscene amount of money on food that doesn't even taste McGood.  My way right away is to go back to doing the things you do good.  And you can King Size that.  Sincerely,  Anthony Doria    Ah.  Now I feel McBetter.  :o)  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   So there's this dog named Max.  I am not gonna really go into the details of Max's life because well they aren't important.  (And also I wouldn't want to say something that is not true and stir up controversy.  You all know Max.  You all have your own oppinions of Max)  So anyway, Max is walking along the road one day and he meats a Rat named Fred.  Fred needed some food and asked Max if he would give him some.  Although Max only had a limited supply Max agreed because Fred said he would pay him back in a week.  One week later Fred fled the city with out paying Max back the food.  So Max strived on.  He kept smiling and kept walking...as Max does.  One day Max went to go get some more food from his food dish and it was gone.  Max found out that his friend Laura the elephant had taken it and wouldn't give if back.  Max, foodless, smiled and kept on walking...as Max does.  Trying to scrounge up  some food from the streets Max stumbles upon another dog.  This older dog named Sam, promised Max some food at the end of the week.  So Max waited patiently for some food but, at the end of the week he was left with nothing.  At this point, everyone in neighborhood didn't like Max anymore.  They all thought he was a mangy (sp?) old street dog that nobody should care about because all he did was complain about them.  But, that's not how it was at all.  See, over the years Max was given food by many differant  humans...all of which he greatly appreciated.  The only people he was upset with was Fred the Rat....Laura the Elephant and of course Sam the older Dog.   But, at this point in Max's life...it didn't matter.  Everyone had excommunicated him out of there lifes because of some sort of preconceived notion that he hated them first.  Well, Max is hungry now.  And lonely out there on the streets.  But, I received a letter from him just a few days ago (written in dog-language of course)(yah...I can read dog....can't everyone?)  The note said said:  Dear everyone,  I just wanted to let the following people know that I forgive them for wrongs they may or may not have consciously or unconsciously bestowed upon me.  Fred the Rat Laura the Elephant Sam the Older Dog  And furthermore, I wish everyone that was and still continues to be a friend to me the best in there lives because they have all made me feel special in a way.  As for me.  In light of my new circumstances.  I am gonna do the only thing I know how to do....keep smiling and keep walking.....as Max does.  I love you all  Woof

      Dear Friends,   I have this knack for "creating" holidays (May 17th is national "Come Out of the Closet" Day.  It was a day designed for...you know who...to join hands and celebrate and stuff.  Our luck it would end up like a elephant line or something.  I will give you a minute on that one)  Anyway  Today  February 18th will now be a new Holiday.  It's called the "I'm Still Alive" day.  See most of you don't know but, "Dear Friends" was started because one day I was bored and I wasn't receiving emails from anyone.  I sent them but, they didn't return them.  So I figured if I started writing cool little columns about retarded thoughts (God Knows I have a bunch) maybe I would get a few replies.  You all know how well that worked...heh heh.....So in the past couple of weeks everyone has been...how you would  say...caught up in their positively perfect lives.  Not that that is bad....I just miss you all.  So Today has now been ordained as "I am still Alive" Day.  Today it is your job to email me and anyone else you haven't talked to in a while (Friends, Family, Babies Mom)(That was a really bad joke).  You don't have to say much.  Just send an email entitled...."I'm Still Alive"  and I will be more than happy with it.  Until next time Friends....  And  Happy "I'm Still Alive" Day  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   So.  Where ya been?  Huh?  You think you can just dissapear for a while and then suddenly show up when you feel like it?  Do you know what you put us through?  We are staying up late.  Wondering if you are laying in a sewer ditch.  You know there are people that care about you, the least you can do is update them.  We are not asking for a long drawn out letter.  We are just asking you to drop a note once in a while.  After all, we enjoy your company.  When you do something like this we feel like you don't want to be  around us?  I hope that is not how you feel.  That is the way we feel?  We feel like you just gave up on us.  Well, if you didn't then good.  But, if you did give up....if you truely gave up just remember.....we DID NOT give up on you.  We never will.  No matter what you do.  We still care about you.   We miss you.  You don't realize how much you mean to us.  I know we might not show it all the time but, you get older and lives slowly move in differant directions.  But, trust us when we say....we still think of you from time to time.  Wondering if your dreams are coming true because we know you are too stubborn to let them go.  That is not a bad thing.  Sometimes we wish we could think like you.  You don't know what you mean to us.  You really don't.  I hope someday you realize how important you really are in our lives.  But, enough chastizing.  We forgive you...just send us a letter everyonce in a while.  Or give us a ring.  you know?  Alright?  Ok, well you take care now and we hope to see you soon.  We love you.  *With all your permission I would like to send that letter from all of you....to all of me. :o)*  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   There is this guys.  Let's call him Josh.  (No not that Josh....what's funny is, that phrase pertains to atleast five of you).  Anyway, this Josh is special (I told you it wasn't your Josh).  He is one of those people that when he dies people will talk about him.  They will learn valued tools of life by studying his actions.  His triumphts.  His tribulations.  See Josh looked at the world in a very differant way.  Differant than anyone else that he lived with.  For that, (as usual) he got crapped on for looking this way.  Everyone said stuff like, "What is this guy's deal?  Why is he not following the rules.  Why is he being a rebel?  Why does he do those things?"  "Those Things" were simple.  Love, friendship, encouragement, confidence.  He was the guy that was proud of you when you succeeded and helped you cry when you failed.  He listened to everyone's problems.  He just sat and listened.  Josh's friends would go on and on and on about every life-struggle and Josh humbly opened his ear and smiled.  He offered so much to make others happy.  Some say he offered too much sometimes.  See Josh had a dream.  The dream was simple.  His dream was to "Never Stop Dreaming."  Everyday he let his thoughts float to the world that would be....as long as he never stopped hoping that it would come true.  Despite popular belief, Josh knew his dream would become reality because it takes a child to dream...but it takes a man to chase that dream.  Just as Josh became a man...he never stopped chasing.  He never let go of his dream.  All his elders dissapointedly looked down on him.  They mischieviously decieved him.   He turned to his friends only to find no help.  So much help he had given out...yet he got none in return.  Then everyone turned on him.  They chastised him for being so "silly" and "immature" for choosing to chase his dream.  To continue to think for himself and do what he felt he had been created to do.  They all said, "It can't be done.  Turn back now and come to your senses."  But then,  He did it.  He created his dream.  He became his destiny.  In one moment he turned from Josh, the ignorant youth, to Josh, the pioneer.  Suddenly belief structures are being constructed diriving from his thoughts and ideas.  People are blessing him instead of mocking him.  Everyone wants to help him now but, more importantly everyone wants more of him.  But, that's not how it should be.  See the point of this letter is....Out of all the important crap that plagues our minds each day....we always remember those "pioneers" that helped us get here.  But, what we should realize is that as bad as we think our lives suck.....Jesus...er...I mean...Josh's life probably sucked worse.  Why...because he went through the same stuff we did.  The lonliness...the saddness...the depression...the dissapointment....Everything.  The part that sucks though is....he had to deal with it all on his own.  No one thought that he might be hurting behind that helpful smile.  I think this is a good time to find that person that is always there for you.  To cry on, to make you laugh, to help you out, to save your butt or simply to Forgive you when you both know he/she shouldn't have.  Find that person for me and tell them...."Thanks Josh"  Love you guys,   Antny

      Dear Friends,   (Note:  Regarding the last letter...Jennifer White has now become my new crush for the simple fact that she actually sent an email back voting.  Hopefully this proves two points...Point 1:  Jennifer White is NOT a snobby famous person....and #B  I GOT A CHANCE!!!)  Memorial Day.  A day to reflect on those who lost their lives fighting for this country.  Bet you didn't know that.  I sure didn't.  Nope.  It took me a whole day of bordem to figure out why the hell everything was closed and no one was out in town today.  It was only when I finally came to my conclusion that I decided that I would take you on a brain-storming trip through my my own warped little mind.  I first decided to search the community for hopes of a sign or a revelation on why this day was celebrated.  It wasn't for people who work hard for a living-that's Labor Day (Although as all you teenagers know Labor Day just means you have to pull a double shift at the burger joint)  Then I thought well it's for War Veterens?  No Dice Cheeno that's Veteren's Day.  So I thought what is a Memorial?  Like the Washington Monument?  Mount Rushmore?  Statue of Liberty?  These are Memorials.  We are taking the day off to celebrate these?  I mean not only are we braking a commandment by worshiping a man-made idol but, more importantly, most of our Memorials were built by French Guys!  So I can't get my mail today because I have to celebrate a Gigantic Statue of a French Guy's Mother?  I knew this couldn't be the case because in essence the closest French people are Canadians and wouldn't they just be laughing their...um...uh.."boots" off if we didn't work today for them.  So I looked for a differant answer.  Maybe Memorial Day was like one of those Holidays that doesn't actually mean anything.....like Columbus Day.  It was Chris Rock that said, "Nobody celebrates Columbus Day.  No puts, like, Three ships in their yard."  Very true and yet we hold a special day out of the year for a man who discovered the West Indies?  The West Indies?  What happened to good ole Americo Vespuci?  Why didn't he get a day?  Was his last name to hard to pronounce or something?  I don't think that was the case. No, I think when the idea of a Holiday first came up a long time ago they were just aching for reasons to have one.  I'm serious.  I also think if we just discovered the idea of creating a National holiday this year...America would have some interesting holidays.  We would have days like....Beenie Baby Day....Superbowl Day....The Baldwins Birthday would be like another Chanauka.  We would also have more race-related days but, everyone would wanna get in on the action.  Dominican Republicans Day.  Greenlanders Day (they are always forgotten about).  Uraguay Day (You get five points if you send back a Simpson's quote using Uraquay :o).  Then there would have to be an Old People Day for some Psycho Reason.  Like they don't get enough already.  We continue to let them drive even though they are blind, can't eat solid foods and randomly relieve themselves without noticing.  If some of them hadn't died for this coun......Hey!  (And that's when it hit me)  People died for this country.  People died so that I could sit in my house all day ranting and raving about how stupid a holiday created for them is.  Boy I feel like an ass.  Love you guys  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Hello everybody.  First of before I get started today I would just like to thank Joe....biil..um Billing..ton....yah...Joe Billington for winning the Scavenger Hunt.  (here is a hint:  There is no Joe Billington.  Aparrently Nobody likes me anymore :o)  Joe did an excellant job in capturing every item except for the date with Kerri Maxwell which consequently brings me to the subject of this letter.  I have come to a stump.  A wall.  A decided point if you will.  For the last 6 and a half years I have been madly in love with Kerri Maxwell.  I tried desperately to get a date with her over the course of this time but failed miserably every attempt.  This has become somewhat of a little (little?) joke that runs through my life but the day has come to decide whether this joke will continue on or be buried.  I, Anthony Doria, have developed a new Crush.  The Person?  Jennifer White, the d.j. of 105.7 the point.  Now what can one do?  Both women are hot, smart, hot, funny, hot, and most important both women will probably NEVER go out with me.  But, which do I chose?  I could have both but, then I quote Ross from friends when he says, "BOTH!  I can't have two cats!  Joey is the kinda guy that can have two cats."  So I have decided to leave it up to my friends.  Who will be my new Crush from this day forward.  Kerri Maxwell?  Or Jennifer White?  Send me your answer (hopefully this one is not to complicated)  Love you guys,   Antny

We are taking the day off to celebrate these?  I mean not only are we braking a commandment by worshiping a man-made idol but, more importantly, most of our Memorials were built by French Guys!  So I can't get my mail today because I have to celebrate a Gigantic Statue of a French Guy's Mother?  I knew this couldn't be the case because in essence the closest French people are Canadians and wouldn't they just be laughing their...um...uh.."boots" off if we didn't work today for them.  So I looked for a differant answer.  Maybe Memorial Day was like one of those Holidays that doesn't actually mean anything.....like Columbus Day.  It was Chris Rock that said, "Nobody celebrates Columbus Day.  No puts, like, Three ships in their yard."  Very true and yet we hold a special day out of the year for a man who discovered the West Indies?  The West Indies? What happened to good ole Americo Vespuci?  Why didn't he get a day?  Was his last name to hard to pronounce or something?  I don't think that was the case. No, I think when the idea of a Holiday first came up a long time ago they were just aching for reasons to have one.  I'm serious.  I also think if we just discovered the idea of creating a National holiday this year...America would have some interesting holidays.  We would have days like....Beenie Baby Day....Superbowl Day....The Baldwins Birthday would be like another Chanauka.  We would also have more race-related days but, everyone would wanna get in on the action.  Dominican Republicans Day.  Greenlanders Day (they are always forgotten about).  Uraguay Day (You get five points if you send back a Simpson's quote using Uraquay :o).  Then there would have to be an Old People Day for some Psycho Reason.  Like they don't get enough already.  We continue to let them drive even though they are blind, can't eat solid foods and randomly relieve themselves without noticing.  If some of them hadn't died for this coun......Hey!  (And that's when it hit me)  People died for this country.  People died so that I could sit in my house all day ranting and raving about how stupid a holiday created for them is.  Boy I feel like an ass.  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria Love you guys

      Dear Friends,   Hey Everyone.  It's time once again for another Dear Friends.  Just for the record by the way....the last dear friends, where I wrote about my problem with Scrappy, the Phone and my crayons?  Well, it kinda has been taken care of.  See Scrappy ran away before I could get home to see him.  I guess I just can't take care of my pets huh?    Anyways, let's move on.    Life is a very strange thing.  Well, for me it is anyway.  See for a good 18 years of my life I lived to find one thing.....a girl.  I figured if I found that everything else would just fall into place.  But, I realized that's not true.  I hit a huge wall in my life and it's the best wall I ever hit because it taught me to take control of my life and make my own decisions so I could be happy.  It also taught me that the desires of my heart might not come exactly when I yearn for them or in the way I yearn for them.  I just lost....again.....something I have yearned for ever since it became a possiblity for me.  But, I spent a the last day thinking.  Maybe it's just not time for it.  Or maybe it's not even the best for me.  My life has a certain path that will make me happy and complete, it's just up to me to keep myself on it.  And it's up to me to realize what supplies I need during which spot I am at on my path.  (If that didn't make sense forgive me It's 5:59am and I haven't gone to bed yet)  Anyway, the point I probably am not even close to is, We humans are filled with desires that plague our minds and hearts through our whole life but, I think we should realize that though we may feel we need something just because we don't physically don't possess it doesn't mean it's not there and sometimes not having something (or someone) is best for us at certain times.  Of course this theory isn't proven true when it comes to Kerri Maxwell (my high school crush) who after four long years I still didn't get a darn date with...:o)  But, who knows maybe that was for the best too.  Or maybe I don't know what the heck I am talking about because I just stayed up all night watching American History X for the first time (Excellent Movie by the way).  In any case.....As my feelings, thoughts and emotions are jumbled inside my head I sit and try to clarify....relaxing with my guitar and playing Dave Mathews' #41.  (Wow, I went deep with this one friends so If you think I am a crazy psycho send me back an email saying so....on the other hand if you can relate in some way with my feelings send me a message with this simple sentence and nothing else...."I know how you feel, man!")    Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Why am I from Pluto?  The more and more people I meet on this planet the more and more people I realize I don't resemble.  So where are the people like me?  Where are the people that talk like me, think like me, act like me, are as short as me?  Where are the guys that feel it is wrong to cheat on a women who you are committed to?  Where are the people that would give up their coat to someone who is shivering regardless of what they looked like on the outside?  Where are the people who don't have to have money to be happy.  For that matter, where are those people who are happy when they give their money away?  Where are the people that don't have to be seen or heard to feel famous?  Where are the humble people?  Where are the 21 year old Video Game Players?  Where are the dreamers?  Where are the people that try and accomplish it even though everyone said "It can't be done!"  Where are the people that don't care if your too fat?  Too skinny?  Too Short?  Too Tall?  Where are the people that will walk across the hall to pick up that peice of trash even though they don't have too.  Where are the real people?  Where did all the fakes come from?  Where are the people who listen without speaking?  Where are the lovers.  The Caring?  The Understanding.  Where are the people who will believe in you?  Support you?  Where are all the fighters?  Where are the people who will stand up against all odds?  Where are the people who won't sit down at the first sight of confrontation?  Where are the people who think about you even though it by doing so won't better their lives as much as it would yours.  Where is the creativity?  Where is the "I taught myself?"  Where is the "I don't care what other people think?"  Where is the....?   Where are the......?   Where?     Where did YOU go.  Cause us Pluto-ians miss ya....  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   I lost a contact during Hockey Practice Thursday.  Two days later I lost the other one.  The problem with this is I was with out a ready back-up supply.  Anyway, the point I am slowly developing to is this...I couldn't see anything.  Especially, in Walmart.  I thought to my self in my blind haze, "If a good-looking girl walks by...I won't notice."  That's when I went into a day dream.  In this day dream, there was this world, so differant from ours.  I nicknamed it Bizarro World because everything seemed to be backwards.  Short, scrawny high-pitched boys were the popular type as well as overweight women.  The reason for this was because society didn't make rash decisions, using physical attractions as their only basis.  Men and Women both thought brain first, body second.  I know all the men out there don't believe this world exists or they atleast couldn't live in it but, you would be amazed at how well everything worked out.  The absence of lust and envy was apparent as people actually had meaningfull conversations with each other and got to know one another.  My hallucination of the Perfect World was disrupted when I realized I was staring at the same spot on the wall for atleast 15 minutes and 7-9 of those minutes my friends were making fun of me.  I continued on with my day but, couldn't help to wonder if the world will ever come close to Bizarro world.  What do you guysthink?  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   In this latest letter, I am gonna get a bit serious.  I know for some of you it is hard to believe that I can become serious but, there have been occasions.  Anyway, I am gonna talk about an eye-opener that I recently had and hope that or those of you that aren't associated with what I am about to tell you, will be suprised as well.  When I went to highschool there were many certantities. Always expect the princepal to wear his Mickey Mouse outfit the first day of school.  Never assume that the taller, very good-looking girl is fanatically in love with you and not her football player boyfriend (I guess that one just relates to me) But, the most important rule in High School was, "When in Doubt, all Band People are Dorks!"    Now band and ex-band members, don't chastise me yet.  I have learned the error of my ways.  But, I have to admit if you had an instrument you were geeky.  I believed this tragedy up until my senior year.  At that time I had become friends with most of the Band Members and realized they were not non-social as I put them out to be.  But, still the Band.  Something just did not sit with me.  The stories that I had been told and situations I had witnessed had proved to me that Band was nothing for me to get mixed up in.  Then it happened.  A couple of my bestfriends talked me into going to a Band marching contest.  I went expecting the worst and was introduced to one of my biggest life regrets.  See, it wasn't that they played music, or had to wear the goofy costumes and attire.  It was the togetherness that each and every band member shared.  It was that touch of magic that made graduated band members come back home and jump at the chance to go on just one more "Band trip."  It was the love that was shown by each band member as they sat in silence together waiting for the label they had worked so hard to achieve.  Excellence.  I, in my life, had never experienced what each teenager experienced that day.  Along with the Major "Foot in my mouth" feeling it caused an epiphany of my own to draw up.  I'll never forget it.  So to all you who deliver harsh words upon those who carry instruments, I beg you not.  To all those who carry or have carried those instruments, I hope you accept my deepest apologies.  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   There is a mystery afoot ("it's not my feet, I just washed them")(small Mel brooks joke)(very small).  Anyways, This mystery spans accross six states.  Each of you is a suspect.  No one will be able to leave this email until the truth comes out.  That's right you are all stuck here. (unless of course you just deleted this message.......gee....I didn't think about that) So what is the crime?  Simple.  You love me.  See my body and brain is like a motor vehicle.  It needs fuel and regular check-ups to run properly.  This "fuel" is made up of many differant ingrediants but, the basis of the formula is love.  Now when I say love, it's a certain kind of love.  Let's take a moment to go through all the 'love's shall we:  Possesion love--"I love my new CD"  Puppy Dog love--the best example of this love is in ninth grade when I wrote "I love Kerri" all over the school bus seat.......did I just admit that.....?  High School love--"C'mon baby" "No" "But, I LOVE you?"  Zach n Kelly love--also known as "Saved by the Bell" love.  This is the love where you meet a girl in High school and compete with a successful wrestler to win her heart.  You do only to lose her when you go to college but, then you catch up with her again and have a one-hour long Marriage episode.......Then she poses for playboy.  And finally, Friendship love.  This love is the best kind because if your CD breaks...it's still there.  If you don't have sex....it's still there....if your girlfriend moves to 90210 it's still there.  And most importantly if you try to get a date for six years straight only to fail  miserably.....survey says?  So back to the mystery.  It seems one of you love me.  I am not gonna name any names...but, the culprit apparently thought of me recently.  Whether it was a hockey game, Dave Mathews song, Adam Sandler movie, or if you are Jennifer White and you want to know who the crazy kid is that keeps sending you emails.....one of you thought of me at some point here in the past couple of days.  Now it may be more than just one of you.  I would be suprised if we have a conspiracy going on here.  But, if the person or persons responsible wants to fess up now....I won't go TOO hard on ya.  I will just leave you with one thing......With the actions you have  taken.......you have my day...."Positively Perfect"  Thank You.  I love you guys.  (love as in Friendship Love) :o)  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Have you ever been in a postition where everything you want is miles and miles away from each other.  Let's say you want:   A Sports Illustrated Football Phone  A Dog Named Scrappy  And Your Favorite Box of 1001 Crayola Crayons   The problem is, you don't have enough money for the Phone, and you have to leave the dog at home so you can go find the crayons.  I know that doesn't make any sense to you guys (and girls) but, you have to let me finish.  See, I came into a point in my life almost about 2 years ago when I decided to start thinking for myself and making myself happy.  Ever Since that time-period I started discovering things in life that I needed to acheive this before-mentioned happiness.  But, now I have come to the horrific Fork in the Road.  Scrappy is sitting at home missing me but, I can go home to see him until I find my Darn Crayola Crayons!  What is Scrappy desides he doesn't want me anymore?  Do I give up on the Crayons to win Scrappy back?  How could I give up the Crayons! Of Course if I had the Sports Illustrated Phone I could Call Scrappy but, #1 I can't afford it and #2 Scrappy is a Dog and I am starting to sound like a lunatic.  To wrap things up friends...I am depressed and confused and all I want is my Phone, Crayons, and my little Doggie...   If anyone could give me any advice or report me to an insane assylum...please do.   Love you guys,   Anthony

      Dear Friends...  Well, alot has happened in the past couple of weeks and I assume you are all wondering why I am not running my mouth about it.  Well, the truth is....I couldn't get to a computer.  So here is what I say....  1)  I have a hurt in my heart for the thousands that lost their life last week. 2)  I have a bigger hurt in my heart for all the people that lost their life trying to save the lives of others. 3)  For those responsible, I have one thing to say.  It's something that was said to me this pass year when my ex-girlfriend and I decided to move in together.  We took a trip back to her house to pick up her stuff and so I could have a "Heart to Heart" with her father.  (Trust me, I brought six pairs of underwear in fear that I would soil the other five)  Her Father said a lot of things that day.  Some were very well-thought out, while others didn't really make too much sense.  But, one thing stuck out in my mind and I will forever remember (probably use on my daughter's boyfriend) He looked at me with great seriousness and said, "If you hurt her, the world is not big enough for you to hide from me.  I WILL find you."  So to conclude.  For the responsible, you laugh now....but, you should know.  The world is not big enough for you to hide.  We WILL find you.  Love you all...  Antny  P.S.  Lisa is great for letting me use her computer.  :o)

      Dear Friends,   I am not a usual guy.  I have never cheated on a girlfriend.  Ever.  I know that some of you might find that hard to believe but, past girlfriends who receive this letter will vouch for me.  I am mr. Commitment.  I guess it's because for the longest time I have always wanted someone.  I have always wanted to share my life with that certain someone.  That has in fact scared EVERY girl that I have been involved with off (again past girlfriends....you agree right?)  Anyway, the point that I am getting to (cause there is always a point) is Today, I didn't want a girlfriend.  I didn't want to be committed.  I didn't want that certain someone.  I have come to a point in my life where I uncertain of who to share my life with as a partner.  I listened to a Dave Mathew's Song today called, "Say Goodbye."  It is an awesome song about Experiencing love with your friend for just one night and then the next day go back to being friends.  For the first time in my life I want that.  I want to be free.  I want to be able to rise above the normal game of "Find-a-GF and see how long you can keep her" and come onto a new playing feild.  My life shouldn't revolve around a person.  A girl.  No offense to any girls out there but, you gals are the most indecisive people on the planet why should I be revolving my life around you.  It's my life.  (isn't that a song?  A gay one at that.  No offense to any gay people or any Bon Jovi fans)  See for as long as I could remember there have always been crutches in my life.  I did my best to get rid of a lot of them early.  But, this one was always the one that snuck in.  And I think today is it's day to finally die.  So here he is the New Crutchless Anthony (no matter which way I look at it, It look's like I just typed "Crotchless").  Love you guys.....  Love you guys,   Antny

      Dear Friends,   Well Well Well Friends, you are the remaining list of Anthony's Friends that would like to continue to get emails from him.  So congratulate yourselves (or find yourself in the same position Neo did in the first Matrix movie when the other dude said, "I know what you are thinking...I should have taken the blue pill")  Needless to say, you love me and want to hear more of me and what's more important I finished posting all the "Dear Friends" letters on the site (in which you can check out down below) so it is time for a Brand New "Dear Friends."    So heeeeeerrrrrrreeeeee we go.    So I have been through a lot the past month or so.  Hell actually the past year.  See last year about August or so I was playing around in some dirt (as little boys do).  I found this piece of glass in the dirt that looked so beautiful and so perfect.  I gazed at it for a while and decided finally (even though my parental figures advised me not to) to pick this piece of glass up.  I held that piece of glass high in my hands as to say to the world "LOOK WHAT I HAVE!  LOOK WHAT I OBTAINED!  LOOK WHAT I HAVE THAT YOU DON'T!"  But you know what happened?    (say it with me with the ever familiar roll of the eyes)  What Anthony?  The Damn Piece of glass cut me.  This beautiful piece of glass put a nice 3 inch sliver down my left hand and I did what any little boy who had just been hurt.  I dropped that peice of glass and I ran and hid.    Now let's hop in the Delorian and shoot back to the Future a bit (1.21 gigawats!!!!!)  It's now November 28th, and here I am still wounded from the beautiful glass that turned out to have a sharp deadly edge.  But, as luck would have it I found the greatest thing you could find if you had a wound of this stature....I found a Spunge Bob Blue Bandaid.  So I put this bandaid on and ooooh boy did this bandaid do everything it was supposed to.  It protected my wound.  It kept all the stuff I needed in to stay in and it kept all the stuff i needed to keep out....well out.  The best part It made my hand look damn good...(after all spunge bob?)  But, something happened that I didn't count out.  The bandaid got old.    It got crusty  It lost it's stickyness....  I mean after all it's just a bandaid.  It's not like it's part of my skin.  Just a temporary fix.  I will admit that I wish it was more...(like I said...who would want spunge bob to be a part of them).  But the reality of it was it was just a bandaid it did it's job and now it was ready to come off.    So I took it off.    And I missed my spunge bob bandaid.  I missed it so much.    But today you know what I realized?  My spunge bob bandaid did the best thing it could have ever done....because now I look down at my left hand and I don't see a wound.    My wound has healed.  Thanks to you Bob...  Love you guys  Antny

      THE FIRST EVER DEAR FRIENDS!!!!!!  Dear Friends,   Well, the Mountain Home Hockey Tournament just ended and we took silver medal.  I would love to go into it but, I am sure I will bore you all.  Anyway, the reason of this letter is a very slick and sly way of trying to get you all to write me emails.  Also, Anthony spends alot of his day thinking up real stupid stuff in his head.  And I guess it would be good to get it out.  So the deal is so, When I think  up stupid stuff.  I will write about it and tell you.  Then you send me and email back telling me how retarded I am and we are all happy.  :o)  I work in a warehouse all my day.  So needless to say, I have alot of time on my hands trying to entertain myself.  I also get my choice of work-music and although the MH radio stations are worthy enough to go national, I choose pick a station which you might say is somewhat....well....Dorky.  The Oldies station.  I know what most of you are saying, "like, sock-hop stuff?"  The answer to that question is....well....yes.  Love it.  Can't get enough. Don't believe me?  Fine.  Let's go over that facts here.  Even though oldies are so geeky it's funny how over 70 nineties artist's have decided to re-record these old songs to makes lot's of money? Still, not convinced?  Songs fromt the fifties, sixties, and early seventies are used more for movie soundtracks than any other songs from any other generation combined.  Now look if you are looking for your precious songs with Lusty whims take a look at a few Marvin Gaye songs, preferably "let's get it on."  What about your passionate/intimate side.  Nothing says, "I love you," like the greatest love song of our time....Unchained Melody.....Righteous Brothers.  This past decade, society was torn in shreds.  One of the many causes of this was the lack of entertainment in this world.  The people that I grow up with are the most creative people I know but, without something to entertain them the turn to drinking, drugs and sex to get them through this life.  Too bad we are not able to "Twist and Shout," "Mash Potato," or "Shake it Baby"  anymore.  It seems like would be a bit more exciting.  Of course I could just be talking out of my butt because it's six in the morning. Regardless, I probably will never know because no one emails me.  :o)  Love you guys,  Antny

      Dear Friends,   I used to have a way of thinking that I am completely not proud of.  I don't know if anyone else thought this way but, I was a big believer in sypathy.  Patronizing my self was almost a daily affirmation in the way that I could not sleep until I found something about my life that was wrong.  I understood that I wasn't the only one that had it bad out there.  I didn't feel alone.  I just felt that I, like many people out in the world today didn't deserve what happens to me on a daily basis.  I am not gonna go into things because for the first time in my life I feel like my hardships and problems are not for public use.  They shouldn't be flaunted or thrust upon people whatever the intention may be.  I do admit that I never once wanted sympathy from another.  Yet, I acted as though It was a perverbial "IOU"  that anyone I have every met was branded with at birth.  But, as I said...this is the way I used to think.  Today I realized something.  I was created.  I was placed in the spot that I am in.  My life has gone the way it has and, furthermore, I have endured all the laughs, cries, loves, hates for one reason.  Because I was made for it.  Why would my creator (who ever he or she may be) create me and then throw me into all these tough situations that I can't handle.  That's the question I used to ask.  But, really there is no question.  There is only that answer.  That answer:  "The only reason I am in this mess is because I have the ability to handle it"  No one plays a video game that's impossible to win.  No body plays Volleyball against a bunch of 5 year olds.  The reason why is because no one wants to play the game if it's so easy it's ridiculous.  Just like no one wants to play if you are guarenteed from the start that you are gonna lose.  That's why we all go through what we go through.  Because deep down...we have the power to win.  We have the power to make it.  That's why it's not easy.  It's also why it's not so hard that's impossible.  I leave you all with the questions that helped me get over this hump.  What is better than hitting that three-pointer to win the game?  What is better than spiking that getting that slapshot off the ground for the first time after months of practice?  What is better than playing that guitar riff with ease after messing up so many times?  What is better than than winning, when you know you worked so hard for it and despite everyone else telling you it couldn't be done....you did it.  Why?  Cause you were made to do it.  love you guys.  Anthony

      Dear Friends,   I had a friend once.  It always seemed like this friend was hiding things from me.  It seemed like my friend was intentionally trying to hurt me.  I didn't understand why because I never did anything to hurt this person.  So one day I heard something bad that this person did.  It made me very angry.  So angry that I envisioned what I was gonna say to this person when I saw them.  Boy was I gonna let them have it.  They would never experience the guilt that I was gonna put them through.  I planned out each word.  Every excuse that was a possibility of being offered...I had a harsh comeback for.   After all, this is hard love we are talking about.  Take no prisoners.  I  am the one at who is hurting.  This person doesn't have a heart.  They don't cry when it's shattered like I do.  The only thing this person is doing is purposely trying to hurt me.  Then it happens.  I see my friend.  And BAMMMMMMM.  I let my friend have it.  My friend looked at me with shocked eyes.  Trying to play me for a fool.  Trying to tell me that they were the victim..but, I knew better.  I mean, come on....who should I trust?  My friend who I have known since he was born?  Or a person I have never even met?   I'm so stupid...  Love you guys,   Antny

      Dear Friends,   Oooooooooooweeeeoooooweeeoooh Iiiiiiiiii Ohhhhh I'm still alive! Yeah ye Yeah Iiiiii Ohhh I'm Still alive  Ok probably a bad Pearl Jam impression but, everyone gets the point.  I am just writing real quick to let you all know that I love you and I am "Still Alive"  I want you all to think about Thursday.  I don't know why or what for just think about it.  Thursday is gonna be the biggest day of your lives.  Something huge is gonna happen.  It might seem bad at first but, in the end it will help.  Or it could be something you have been waiting for.  Whatever this life changing thing is....it is big.  Thursday.  Thursday.  Thursday.  I don't know what it is but, my NEPO is telling me it's big.  Keep your eyes open and when Thursday comes rolling around I want you to indentify the event, whatever it may be, and tell me about it.  (Even you Jennifer White).   Remember it might not be important to anyone else but you.  The thing is  though, if it is important to you...that makes it important.  That's why I want to know what it is.  Details people.  I have about 32 friends on my Dear Friends list which means I should be reading 32 emails on Thursday (and deleting the 60 emails that I get daily about all the "Contests" I won).  Thursday.  Something is gonna happen.  Are you Ready for it?  I sure as hell am.  Love you guys.  Antny

      Dear Friends,   So no one called me.  Nobody emailed me either.  But, you know what.  I am glad.  I am.  Truthfully.  NO SARCASM.  I used to tell a story to people all the time hopeing that it might help them in the walk of life.  In my head, it made sense and had a wonderful point.  See, I believe, everyone is born with certain devils in their lives.   Bad things that have just "always been there."  Things that you have always done.  Whether it's a personality flaw.  Whether it's a pridefull thought.  Whether it is something blatantly obvious or something hidden deep down inside.  Whatever these "devils" are...everyone has them.  And it's everyone's job to discover them and rid their lives of them.  That was the big line I used.  Makes ya think.  Well, it might have made you think.  But, you know....it never really made me think.  Nope.  I just continued on feeling like I "helped" someone.  Feeling like I just did good.  Good job Anthony, you saved someone.  Moron.  How can someone who analizes everything about life be so blind and stupid to miss this big thing?  This great gigantic 2 by 4 sticking out of your eye?  How did you miss that?  How did you not realize what you were doing?  And then the worst part is....you rant and rave about some sort of respect or love or pat on the back that you think you deserve?  I am not entitled to anything.  I am not entitled to love, friendships, or anything else that I have in my life.  I don't deserve these things that I am getting.  And I definetely don't deserve the things I am not getting.  I don't even deserve to have you guys read these letters each time something pops into my head.  Yet, for almost 22 years of my life I lived everyday thinking I do.  Expecting my "time" to come.  Expecting everyone to realize how "great" of a person I am.  I am not great.  I am not even good.  Being good is not doing everything in your power to control the thoughts and actions of your peers.  Being good is not even an action.  Being good....is  smiling and giving me a hug even though I do things that disgust you.  Being good is listening to me whine about my life on the phone, knowing the the true problem lies within myself and yet saying nothing because you know now is not the time.  Being good is getting the courage to tell me the truth when it is the right time.  Hell, that's not just being good....that's is what is great.  That is what seperates the people who think they are special from the people that truely are in this world.  I have a confession to make.   For a long time I thought I was special.  I thought I was sent here for you guys.  To help you.  To be here for you.  To be your friend.  But,  today....I realized.....It was you guys that were sent here for me.  You guys are the special ones.  I am just a normal guy with just as many "devils" as the next person.  I guess it's time to start eating my words and finding out what those devils are.  Thank you.  Love you guys  Anthony

      Dear Friends,   There is a person I dislike.  I use the word dislike because, if I say anything else this letter will turn into an HBO special.  But, I really dislike this person.  Ever since the moment I met this person, I have disliked them.  Countless numbers of times have I tried to find a way to like this person but, I have failed on each occasion.  So I try and stay away from this person but, often this person sneaks into my life, takes their shoes off and makes themself at home.  I don't ask them to.  But, yet they do.  This person comes to my house and ruins a perfectly good day.  This person visits me at work.  Even sometimes when I am about to go to sleep this person comes and wakes me right up.  I dislike stuff like that.  I dislike people like that.  Why is it when I am happy and life is going good, this person shows up and makes it miserable.  I don't understand.  That is when I think to myself and wonder.  Maybe this person needs me.  Maybe, they are lonely or maybe this person cannot live with out me.  Maybe they need people like me to survive on this earth.  Like humans and plants, who exchange oxogen and carbon dioxide, this person exchanges some sort of need to go on living with me.  Maybe I get something in return.  It is just hidden within my mind or I am handicapped by a natural immaturity and cannot comprehend it.  Or maybe the person is here right now.  All I know is this person will never go away.  So I better look forward to a long life with them.     Love you guys  Antny  P.S. Can you guess what this person's name is?

      Dear Friends,   Let me supply the scenario and/or situation for you.  This involves three subjects.....Guy-A, Guy-B, and Gal-A.  We will call them Peter Paul and Mary for clearity upon the story in which I am about to tell.  Let's say that Peter and Mary are dating.  They have been together for about a month or so but, like any other teenage relationship they have already committed to giving their "I love you"'s and truely believe that they will be together for ever.  Along come Paul.  He knows vaguely of Peter and Mary and really has no opinion on the too......until that is....he meets Mary.  Right from the start he is interested in her and becomes somewhat obsessed in a hidden way.  He starts his day thinking of her, and ends it with a dream of her.  Finally he admits to himself he is in love with her and has to do something about it.  Peter and Mary are now going on their second month, having a few problems but, because of the early commitment they have made, find it impossible to break up.  Paul has now become Mary's bestfriend.  He hears all the drawbacks that Peter has and has become her main source of advice.  Though he tries to hide it Paul let's his love for Mary heavily influence the advice he dispences to Mary and before the third month......Mary finally breaks up with Peter.  Paul now, imitating the good friend that he is not, seeks to console Mary in hopes that she will realize he is the one for her.  But, as fate has it (and it almost always works this way) Mary opens up Paul's chest, removes his heart and slices it into a million pieces by remarking the words, "I only like you as a FRIEND."    It's funny, you might have been bored or thought this story was stupid but, if you look back (or forward) into each of your lives you played the part of atleast one of these characters....:o)  Love you guys,   Antny

      Dear Friends,   So there is this teddy bear. He is a cute cuddly little teddy bear. Never does anything wrong. All he wants in life are three things...   1) He wants to be in the BEAR PARADE. The biggest Teddy Bear event in Teddy Bear History of course. He doesnt' care if he is in front of all the other bears or anything like that. He just wants to be in the parade for once in his teddy bear life.  2) He wants to just go out on one date...ONE DATE...with the girlie bear of his dreams. With out anything going wrong....especially HIS TEDDY BEAR CAR BREAKING DOWN!!!!  3) He wants a Mitsubishi 3000 GT.   Now, This little cute, cuddly bunny...er...teddy bear is not a bad teddy bear. He enjoys life and overly gives himself for others (and not just others but, all the very bad little teddy bears out there.....shall we call them the "Trailer Doods"). He continues to help others before himself and is satisfied with that for he thinks someday....he will be rewarded.   Then...   A flamming ball of Cow-Dung falls out of the sky and nails this smaller than the average teddy bear. Next thing you know he is up to his ears in Crap.   Why does this happen? What did this cute little cuddly teddy bear deserve to have crap heaved at him. For that matter, who is heaving the crap? Finally what did this Crap-Heaver eat that makes his crap stink so badly. Little chunks of....anyway, I am off the subject.   Look into your lives. Is there a teddy bear that helps you out all the time being crapped on? Do me a favor and offer him or her and umbrella. I wish someone would offer me one.   I love you guys.   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   I'm sorry I'm sorry I did it but, I couldn't help my self it snuck up on me really I was suprised myself I never even seen it coming I was just with you one day and to my suprise it popped out and grabbed me I didn't want it to happen I didn't want to complicate things I just wanted life to be normal but, no it had to change and it has changed hasn't it respect has been lost why?  because the friendship was not strong enough to handle a blow like this we were too weak fragile there was no way of knowing that the rope would break but, now it has and I am powerless to stop it from sinking into the abyss the abyss of loneliness The abyss of where so many friendships that were never born will rest So many wonderful memories that will never be because I was selfish enough to go and do what I did At first I thought it would be good We could share our lives Hours of talking, chatting realization of how many things we have in common or how many we don't have in common but, find so interesting Our lives intertwine, music being the glue we simultanisously aid each other as if we are the medicine that each other have been looking for I am amazed at your beauty, and willingness to move on even all that has happened we learn from each other and care for one another and believe in one another because I believe in you I do  but, maybe that's what got me in this mess You being so Godly So heavenly So unbelievable that my eyes grew bigger than my stomach I thought I could obtain this magic But, I can't And I see now what my attempt has done It's ruined any chance I had with you It's derailed any relationship that was on track It's wilted any flower that was meant to bloom I'm sorry I'm sorry for this For I know that there is no way that I can repay you    That was written for all the girls out there that were mortified the day they found out, "Anthony Doria has a crush on you."  Love you guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,  This is a very special Dear Friends letter.  It is kinda like a Mission Statement for the Dear Friends letter that I send out.  See I just had maybe one of the best weekends in my life.  I was kinda down in the dumps lately.  Not for any previously mentioned problems.  No my buddy Matt put it very elequently when he said, "Life just sucks right now."  Of course I am no stranger to life "sucking" nor trying to make the best of it when it does inhale wind rather rapidly but for some reason I am in a slump and can't seem to climb out.  Then it happened.  I check my email, (don't let this fool you usually it is empty) and I read the email that changed the down/depressing weekend into a exciting/Fun/NEPO weekend.  I know what you are thinking: What could possibly change my mood from curl-up-in-a-ball Sad to dance-in-the-streets-naked Happy?  My Boys cam to town.  Actually not just my boys but my friends.  The friends that love me regardless of where I am or what I do.  The Friends that believe in me and are interested in my life.  The Friends that don't let distance change feelings there friendship for me.  These are the friendships that last ages.  I haven't talked to these friends for at least 4 to 5 months and they showed up with smiles on their faces and a big fat pound of NEPO to throw in the mix.  Now I don't want you guys to think I am getting soft (for those of you that know me you are probably saying, "getting?").  But, there many things I am thankful for but, few deserve it as much as my friends.  It's a sobering thought to know that when I am either Rich and Famous or a old poor bum scrapping for food there are two things that will always hold true:  1.  I will never get a date with Kerri Maxwell.  (believe me I've tried) 2.  My friends will always love me.  They will always be there.  Quoting the next line from a movie.  Creating the next Holiday.  Learning the next N'SYNC dance move.  Going to the next Blink 182 Concert.  Driving to the next town for some peace and quiet.  Shooting down the next Exxon Tiger.  Helping a friend in a lonely situation (you know who you are).  Recording the next Video skit.  Needing advice on the next girl.  The next guy.  The next life.  The next life decision.  And the next moment that you wait earnestly to see your friends again.  To experience the love and happiness that you can't help to endure.  That's what I did this weekend.  Oh and I got piss-drunk too.   I love you guys and girls.  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Have you ever felt dead.  Completely useless to the world.  Stuck in this bubble of crap with no way out?  The last month or so that was me in a nutshell (please....no nutshell jokes).  I came to a dead end last night.  A place where I had two choices.....Quit, go home and go to sleep....or bend over, take it up the tail pipe and assume leadership.  I fortunately chose the second one.  After a looo-haaa-aaaat of discussing with my self what the right move was....I knew what I needed to do.  And that's where NEPO came back again my friends.  If any of you ever said to yourself, "What the hell is he talking about?"  This email will explain NEPO in the best way I can.  Here we go.  Once I , again, chose the right path in life I was rewarded.  This "reward" may not seem large to anyone else but, to me it meant the world.  (No Jennifer White didn't ask me out....she's in Chi-Town at Ozzfest....Good guess though.)  It was one simple phone call.  I didn't recieve anything.  I didn't win or lose anything.  I just got a phone call.  But that one phone call made me break out of my shell that I have been living in for the last month.  (Please.....no Ninja Turtle jokes)  See I have a specific purpose for myself on this planet.....sometimes I stray away from it...that's when NEPO leaves.  But, when I realize I have been drifted off the path and correct myself....NEPO returns.  NEPO is the feeling you get when you laugh uncontrollably at a joke only you and your best friend would understand.  NEPO is when you see that spark in your girlfriends smile.  NEPO is when everything seems to work out....you don't know why.  But, most of all NEPO is when you know your life is on the right track.  Everyone has a NEPO, the only problem is....some people try to deny that it is there....But it is....I have proof.  Love you guys...  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Our lives often revolve around one thing and one thing only.  Ourselves.  This is not a "conceited" rant or far from it.  It is more of just an analyzation that has occured to me over that last few days.  Everyone on this earth has one thing in common.  No matter what skin color.  No matter what Gender.  No matter what physical attribute anyone possesses, everyone's life revolves around themselves.  Of course this is not a bad thing.  I have been a long-time advicate of "Being your own person" and "living life the way you see fit" but, the one drawback everyone receives with controling their own lives is they have no power over the fate that is intended for another.  Infact, short of Miss Cleo, no one even has the power to comprehend what might happen in someone else's life in a month.  A week.  One night.  One moment.  Although I understand the grave danger that would accompany this power, this weekend for a moment I wish I possessed it.  I wish I knew the future.  I wish I was allowed to change it.  It was then that I realized that I was revolved around my own life.  I was wrapped up in my plans.  Constantly debating my next move.  Because shockingly, at two in the morning, I received some news.  The type of phone call that no wants wants to hear and then begs for it not to be real in duration.  The phone call that you wish was just a freakish nightmare to remind you that your friend misses you.  That you miss her.  The phone call that gives you that feeling of emptyness in a split second.  The phone call that above all else has the power to stop your self-revolved life dead in it's tracks.  The phone call that humble reports that your friend has passed away.  To a friend that showed great love.  To a friend who was always the first one to reply to my emails.  To a friend who always was there to listen to me bitch, complain, cry, whine, talk, gush, and goof.  To a friend who heard me cry.  To a friend who heard me laugh.  To a friend who I could always go to no matter what the hour.  Most importantly, to a friend who probably understood but more importantly accepted me more than a lot of people have ever even attempted.  I love you and I will miss you Ruby.  Now you are in Heaven....where the song "Whip it" is forbidden :o)  Anthony

      Dear Friends,   Sometimes I wonder what I could have been. Where I could have gone.  Who I could know.  Everyday each and everyone of us is faced with certain life-changing decisions that may lead us on a new path.  Each day we make those decisions and waltz through the next entrance of the maze that precedes us.  Can you imagine for a moment though where you would be if you chose diferantly?  If you would have went to college?  If you would have said yes to that guy?  Or if you would have said no?  If you would have not gone along on the "Greatest Road Trip Ever" to Pittsburgh?  If, as you sat staring at each other smiling, you would have just leaned over and kissed her?  If you would have waited a week to search for a diferant place to live?  If you would have been born in Alaska?  Hawaii?  Los Angelos?  Delaware?  Ok not Delaware... (No offense to the lovely citizens of Delaware)  But, you understand my point.  What would you being doing right now if you would have chosen door #3 instead of two?  If you would have taken the money?  If you would have not told her that you liked her?  If you did tell her?  If you listened to your mother?  If you quit when you said you were gonna.  If you kept on going even though everyone told you to quit?  If Kerri Maxwell actually did go out on a date with you!  And when she did you didn't enjoy it?  If you said hi to the guy next to you even though he scares you?  If you didn't talk to the less-than reputable girl running the laundry mat.  If you did forgive even though you had no reason to?  If you went left instead of right.  If you didn't play her the song your wrote.  If you hit that car in front of you.  If you read this email instead of deleting it?  Would it be weird?  I guess the question really is.  Would you be happier?  Or did you make the right decisions?  That question can really be answered by another.  Are you a person who regrets their decisions or the ones they ran from?  Sometimes I don't really know who I am.  I know who I want to be but if you sit and watch people now-a-days, you will realize that the world is made up of people fighting over who they are and who they want to be.  Or at least I know that's how I am.  I know what I want to be.....yet many subconcious moments I fall into who I am and am imprisoned with out knowing it.  That's why I think it's good for myself and anyone else that can relate to this to stop and review your life for a moment.  Take all the things that I think I am and size them up with my actual life.  If it doesn't equal out then I am doing something wrong.  Then go buy yourself some Little Debbies' as a reward.  The one's with the chocolate chips are good.  :o)  Love you Guys,   Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   I wish I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner That is what I truely want to be For if I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner Everyone would be in love with me....  I am glad I'm not an Oscar Meyer Weiner That is what I NEVER want to be Cause if I were an Oscar Meyer Weiner Everybody would try to eat me....  ----------------------------------------  Two kids...Two completely differant opinions of the same long, tasty item.  Who is right?  I mean is it better to be a Weiner or not?  On one hand everyone wants you but, on the other hand the price to pay for popularity is being eaten!  That itself brings up a good point.  What if people couldn't eat you anymore.  What if you were just not offering yourself up for mutilation?  Would everyone want you anymore?  Would they praise you with songs?  Would they know that your cousin (bologna) has a first name?  And if that's not enough would they go through the trouble of spelling it out?  Or would they give up on you and visit a Ballpark instead?  How quickly would someone change their attitude about your hotdoggity goodness just because you didn't comply with their every desire?  Would they respect the fact that you don't want to be eaten.  That you just want to stay in the package with your brothers and relax with the lunchmeat.  Getting a tan off the flouresent light.  Cruising the dairy section to pick up some chicks.  Poking fun at the overweight folk from the Little Debbie section.  Hanging out with your buddies from the frozen foods.  Boy, those guys are crazy...  Crazy?  I was crazy once....they locked me in a room...I lived there...I died there....they buried me in the ground...worms live in the ground..  Worms?  I hate worms...they make me crazy...  Crazy?  I was crazy once....   :o)  I love you Weiners...  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   I'll be honest.  I have been trying to write a "Dear Friends" letter all day long.  I was trying and trying.  I turned on my computer about 8 times and almost sent at least three letters.  But, it all didn't seem right.  I mean, it was a letter.  It might have been filled with cooky humor.  Thoughts on my life...or other peoples lives.  One had a poem.  One had a funny thought.   One of them even involved a bucket of ice cubes and a nine iron.  (What movie is that from?)  I guess what it all came down to was, it wasn't real.  It was like I was trying to do it not because it flowed out of me but, because I felt like I had to.  I felt like it was my duty to write.  Not just for all of you but, for myself as well.  When you decide to become a writer in any form whether musical or not you get to a point sometimes where you think to yourself, "What happens if I stop writing?"  That is when you will stop writing.  That is when your ability to capture feelings, emotions, thoughts and so on will be subsided.  It's at that point when worrying so much about what you do affects what you do.  Or at least that is how it is for me.  Maybe you are differant.  And if you are I simply say, "Good for you."  I may come off sometimes like I am preaching to others on how to live life or how there idea of how to live life is wrong.  But, I assure you all that those are not my intentions.  They shouldn't ever be.  I would never wish any of you to think you have to change your lives, thoughts, dreams or anything else that is important to you to make me or anyone else happy.  See although it seems like I jumped themes in this "Dear Friends" I really didn't.  Writing is exactly like life in the way that once you start worrying about it....that is when it starts going bad.  Once you start thinking, "I hope I am doing this write." that is when you end up messing up.  Please don't confuse this with a question of Pride because that is not what I am talking about.  What I am discussing is more of a question of Confidence.  Being confident that you are you.  And if nobody likes that then it's there loss not yours.  If you the girl of your dreams doesn't want you (or is a Radio D.J. for the Point and you will never have the chance to marry her because she is famous...:o) then there is no need to sacrifice the things that make you happy.  What is important is that you take bit of advice people give you.....but, you also take it with a grain of salt.  I might be the wisest person in the world or I may be the dumbest.  The trick is to not to depend on me or anyone else to give you the answers.  They might not be right but, they may point you in the right direction.  The direction to being happy in life.  Anyway, I better go.  Big Daddy's gonna be on soon and God strike me down now if I missed that.  I love you guys.  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Well, what can I say.  It just wouldn't be a "Dear Friends" if you my life didn't hand me out lemons by the barrel full.  I am actually convinced that I live underneath a lemon tree and everytime a ray of sunshine shines thru to my little meaningless life another lemon magically grows in that spot.  So what do I do?  I mean truthfully, what do I do.  Let's analyze the situation shall we.  I can complain, cry, moan, weep, bitch, yell, scream, guilt, or anything else that would grab someone's attention.  But, I don't want to do that.  Infact, that is what this letter started out as.  A cry for help...actually more than a cry for help.  It was a cry to realize that I exist and moreover, it was an attempt to force you into being interested in me.  See that is my problem.  Selfishness mixed with Loneliness and you get Anthony.  A guy who can't stand to sit in a house by himself all night long so he secretly draws up fake fate.  Yup.  Fake Fate.  You know when you meet someone and you instantly know that you are gonna have a long-lasting relationship with them.  Whether it be friendship, love or otherwise.  There is always that feeling that you have.  You know the one.  Right before you  go to bed.  Where you know that this day is a special day in the story that is your life.  If your life was a WB t.v. show this would be the season premier.  Everyone knows the feeling that I am talking about because everyone has had it at one point or another.  (In which has probably led you to your plans this Thursday.....no.....we won't mention what day that is)  But, me?  Oh how I long for that feeling.  And oh how easy it is for me to fraudently create it.  Against Fate.  Fate says, "this isn't supposed to happen."  But, I say, "YES IT IS!" because I yearn to have that feeling so badly.  I am human.  I am not some weird crazy person who doesn't have  feelings.  I get lonely too.  Just like everyone else.  Whether this justifies my actions?  I don't know.  But, I do know that if life hand's you a lemon you should make lemonade.....but, sometimes.........I get sick of drinking lemonade.  I want to drink what everyone else is drinking.    I love you guys.  Anthony Doria

      Dear Friends,   Well, I just got done watching an Arnold Swartzenegger (sp?) movie.  You know the one where he is a burned-out cop/fireman/security guard who has a drinking problem because his family was killed so he goes on a phycotic rampage and destroys a hole bunch of stuff while in the same time completing the revenge on the peverbial bad guy who put him in his state in the first place?    Yah that one...  Anyway, it occured to me during my blight of entertainment that I hadn't wrote a Dear Friends, in a while so I made my way into Tom's room and started my adventure into the world wide web.    You know it's weird living my life.  Constantly analyzing every possible possibility to every questionable question that my mind ever conceivably conceives.  I am serious, I sure all of you don't have enough time on your hands to ever wonder if we can measure distance with time......  ex:  How far you?  oh about 20 minutes away....  Then why is it weird to measure time with distance?   ex:  What time is it?  oh about 30 miles?    That's right....only I would think up something stupid like that.  Well I won't lie.  I might not think it up but, darn it.  I will have the free time to sit and dwell upon it for three hours.  More so, I will write email letters to all my friends about it causing the ever popular thought of "what the hell is he talking about?"  Yet this is me....and this is what I do.  This is who I am.  Who I will always be.  Constantly analyzing stupid analogies that no one would have ever cared about if I hadn't brought it up.  I feel like a ACT Test or something.  I feel like I bring up questions and stories that make no sense yet give other people the compelling feeling to try and figure out.  Yet once they do they probably will never really need the answer the rest of their lives.  Is this true?  Or am I just stuck analyzing myself again?  My life?  My choices?  My dreams?  My love?  Or maybe the love I could have had?  Or should have had?  Or should have hadn't?    I sense I have gone to far.    That's what I get for looking to deep again.  I don't think my brain can handle it.    Love ya,   antny

      Dear Friends,   I have been dwelling a lot lately and well, you know what that means.    It means I have something blatently useless to talk about.    Yet this week I think it's gonna be differant.  This week I am gonna offer a piece of advice.  Some food for the brain if you will.  This week I will discuss and explain in great detail the   (da da da da)  ANTHONY'S THREE MONTH DATING RULE  Let me supply a scenerio for you all and you can tell me if it sounds familiar.    You meet someone, and right from the bat you have a strange comfortable and most important....equal attraction to one another.  So you start the normal human dating ritual (flowers, candy, tonsil-hockey).  After about one month this person (Or person's depending on which culture) seems like God's gift to you and you say to yourself "This is the one!" as a college kid says when looking for a movie in Walmart's 5 dollar DVD section and he/she comes accross "Shadow Warriors" starring Shannon Tweed, Appollo Creed from "Rocky" and last but certainatly not least.......Terry "Hulk" Hogan.    Moving along,   So, it is at this point when the first thought of that word that can be hell and heaven all in the same gravy dish.  You know, the word with more Dr. Jeckal and Mr Hyde traits then the Colonel in the first "American Ninja" Movie?  (ok bad example)  Of Course I am talking about love.  Love Love Love.  The only word we spend countless numbers of hours creating 'higher' standards than the new Snoop Doggy Dog Talk Show (if you know what I mean).  Yet in the same instance, we are so quick to apply this word and all the meaning behind it into every little scarolle *(italion word that I don't know how to spell.  I am not sure what it means except my grandpa use to call my girlfriends it) we meet in a bar and doesn't snubb us when we open up with our pick-up line we stole from Adam Sandler in Anger Management.    (yah the "exploding in my pants" one.......oh yah, I tried it.....heh heh)  As I see I am getting off track I will make a sharp right and bring this letter back to that first month.  The first month of dating.  When everything is perfect.  Now I want you to listen when I say this.    The first month.  IS COMPLETE AND UTTER BULL@#%$&!!!  Follow this scale and you will always have a clear and conscience head when dating.    Month one = Courting Month.  This is the month that your gal/guy is gonna try everything he/she can to make sure you like them.  Go out of there way to do things.  Buy presents.  BE AWARE!!!  This is not the actual person you are dating.  This is merely Ted the salesman they have sent out to close the deal on you.    Month two = Cancellation Month.  This is a very important month.  See initially this person you are dating roped you in but, you still have a 30-day risk free trial period.  They know that at anytime during this month you can cancel your service so they have to take what ever you liked during month one and duplicate it during month two.    Month three =  This is where the evil doer will sink their claws in.  They know they can hold the REAL them back for long so it's time to sign your life away.  It's time to agree to the terms of the life contract.  It's time to get you to say those incredible hulk words.....I LOVE YOU.    Then they've got you.  You stuck.  You are in for life.  What happens next is the real person you are dating comes out and it's no where near who you thought you were dating.  But, you can't leave.....because you are in love.  Sucker.    There is hope though friends.....The next time you date someone.  Wait three months before making any rash decisions.  Fortunately even the evil-est of evil can only hold back their evil-ness for so long.  A period of time before they can't take it anymore.  That period....  Three months.    Three months.   Three months.    This has been Anthony Doria......once again telling you something.....you probably already know.  :o)  Love you guys.   antny

      Dear Friends,   I am cleaning.  Now all of you...(especially my mother) can vouch for the fact that I don't clean very much.  But what most of you don't know is when Anthony gets the sudden urge to clean it's because a question has been imposed on him.  I boggling riddle that perplexes the intellectual inner thoughts and requires a large amount brain power to be resolved.  For some odd reason I harness that power of the mind when I clean.  My specialty.....Bathrooms.  The problem is I have finished fighting off the green moldy monster in my shower us boys like to refer to as "Mo Mo" like it is some sort of mascot for the Apartment, and yet I still have not come to that egnimatic conclusion that will forever put to rest my wandering heart.  So I turn to you.....my friends.  I turn to you with yet another confusing, fragmented collection of elaborate symbols and prefabricated metaphors that have fallen a few Natural Lights short of the "Gramaticcally Correct" suitcase.  (notice the mispelling)    So here we go.    I don't know if I have used this analagy before for the simple fact that it seems so familiar.  Like a thought in the back of our minds that we never pay attention too.    Think of a rose.  How beautiful.  The smell.  The sight.  The taste (if you are some sort of insect of course).  What's funny about rose is as wonderful of a object it is.  The minute you grab for it....it injures you.  Yup.  This rose....suprisingly has thorns.  Now human society normally deems anything painful or harmful to yourself....bad.  Yet a rose is recognized as a love momento.  A token of one's feelings to another.  Why is it a rose has this special power.  This camoflaged stealth mode that makes us forget about the pain and suffering it might cause us and move on into the feelings and thoughts that this red flower may or may not delight us with.  Because it is the truth.  When you recieve a rose only one this is certain.  It is not certain that you will feel safe.  Nor comforted.  Nor Kindness.  Nor will you feel any feeling that you desire.  There is a chance not one will be fulfilled.  Nope.  The only certainty about accepting a rose is that at some time you will be blinded by it's beauty and slowly run your hand down it's long stiff stem.  Then...BAMM.  That's when it gets you.    So my question is this.....  What about a rose makes possibility of getting hurt no more of a worry than Dave Mathews Band not putting on a good show every night?    Is it because we are un-intellegent?  (I think anthony is making up words again)  Or is it because although we have all grown up and left behind the childish thoughts of fate and signs and symbols that might lead our way.....we all have a little kid deep down inside saying remember all that dreams and ideas I had?  Maybe we believe that just this once that rose fulfill our desires.  Maybe you have to endure pain to accept love.  Maybe I have been looking at this all wrong.    Or maybe I should clean some more....  Love you guys..  Antny

      Dear Friends,   You know that movie with that guy and that girl.  They don't like each other in the begining.  Heck they don't even know each other but, then certain things happen.  Some call it luck.  Others call it coincidence.  Some people actually think that those instances were meant to be.  You can always remember this movie because something always goes wrong and it looks like the two aren't gonna make it.  Then it happens....Magically...Love fights through the mess and they come together at the end of the movie.....smiling......holding hands.  He slides his fingers through her hair and gently leans her head to the side and moves in for the kiss.    Blackness...  Then the credits role.    You know that movie?  Well I am here to tell you what happens if that movie didn't stop there.  If the story didn't end there.  If the climax didn't occur.  Because, well that's what real life is.  In real life you can have love stories you just have to remember that the work doesn't ever end.  Let's go back to our movie:    The man (Let's call him Boris) probably was a simply guy.  Didn't like to have to think very much.  But, when he met his co-star (Noris {Bet you thought I was gonna say Natasha}) he noticed something about her that peaked his interest.  She was confusing to all Hell!  It's ok though because Boris loved challenges and was going to win her heart no matter what.  So the entire movie Boris works hard to acheive his goal and in the end he finally does.  Noris falls madly in love with him and they kiss.    Now what?    What happens now?  Do you stay in that state of floating through the clouds?  We are naive if we believe that garbage.   Anyone that's been in any relationship knows that it's not all fun and games.  It's not the finish line.  The gun just went off.  Boris didn't win.  The only thing that happend at the end of that movie was Noris qualified him for the race.  She subsituted him into the game.  That game is going to last his entire life.  He will be running that race for ever.  The only way that out is to quit.  Is to stop.  Sure there is gonna be potholes along the way.  It might rain.  It might snow.  It might hail.  The devil might come up from the pits of hell and unleash terror upon the empty souls that embrace their little lives filled with idolotry and sin.......and I know if that happens two things will always hold true.....  1.  Schools in Chicago will still be in session  and more importantly It would be worth the terror because I....I mean..um..Boris....is simply in the race.  And he is gonna run his hardest from now on.    Love you guys.   Papa D

      Dear Friends,  There was this puppet.  His name is really of no concern but just for this letter let's call him Willow (Speaking of Willow, watch Star Wars Episode one...the pod race scene....Just keep thinking "Willow")  Anyway, Willow wasn't always a puppet.  Actually he was a little boy for a long time (no long nose or long-anything jokes coming....sorry).  For some odd reason unlike his brother....we will call him "P" because he is famous and we don't want to embarass him.....Willow wanted to be a puppet.  He constantly searched the earth for a puppet master but to no avail.  Finally one night, after praying to the puppet gods, he found what seemed to be the greatest puppet master he had ever layed eyes on.  Immediately he let the puppet master string him up.  He felt completely dependent on the puppet master (we'll name him James H.)(James had a lilttle assistant named Kurt)(he talked like a girl)  Anyway, it's late so I will try to wrap this one up.  The point of this story is that after a while Willow wanted a drink of mountain dew.  He looked up at the can but no matter how hard he tried he couldn't move his arm.  He asked the James the Puppet Master but, all the he did was ridicule Willow and tell him he shouldn't drink mountain dew cause it would make him imperfect (It was probably the Yellow #5).  It was then that Willow realized that he had no control over his body anymore.  No control over his actions.  Even his thoughts.  We was completely controlled by the puppet master.  No dependency was worth the loss of the ability to choose how to live life....Even if the choices were not good.  So currently Willow is mustering up the strength to grab the scissors next to the Mountain Dew can and cut the strings currently bounding him to the control the Evil Puppet Master.  I guess Willow's brother was right all along.  It's time to become a real live boy.    Love you guys,   Papa D

      Sonnet #2  Written by Anthony J Doria   Only from a heavenly mind Could have come your creation Men of Earth could not find Enough beauty in this nation, This continent, this world, this universe To amass as close as yours And I bound, for better and for worse From the east coast to the west shores From the top to bottom of the world From every land, sea and air inbetween From the smile of every boy, sparkling eyes of every girl A heart grows larger for you inside me   And if my heart someday exploded like a cannon   There would be enough love to save the planet

      Sonnet #3  Written by Anthony J Doria   A soothing promise made from a vision too true to end or to fade given from me, taken from you And if the sun will always rise and the moon always glow The truth be told through my eyes The truth you will always know It is said that beauty lies in the beholder's hand I feel it's my duty to indulge in the sight of you, so grand   Yet forever, a promise made for two   I promise forever, is where my love lies for you

      Sonnet #1  Written by Anthony J Doria   Searching tirelessly for the capture of sleep My head lay rest yet so fast it spins I hear the song of a bird as the morning creeps And the sound of a heartbeat in the warm nigth winds Each beat profusely echo's in my head As if attempting to distract from my current need They remind me of the cold lonely feel of my bed Without you lying, curled up next to me I see nothing but black yet still can't fall To a place to dream of us together I stay in this world without you at all With harsh reality of not holding you again ever   Yet if I had one breath left in my body to use   I would undoubtedly spare it to say I love you

      Busy Busy Bee Look at me Can you see What I see What I've seen What I saw What I mean Will it be very long  all along am I wrong if I do  write a song just for you Have I gone Long enough eight years it's been rough a few tears lot's of laughs in the end a best friend you appear Who would have seen that one coming talk every so often  bout how we were young and dumb things we did, as I whispered  sweet nothings You bought me stuffed elmo Will I ever forget?  Hell no The canue trip to take  snickers bars floating down the lake Never faked No lies a suprise in my eyes  We were able to Keep  This friendship An amazing feat No one can beat  or give me a treat that is a close as sweet as you are too me A friend I can greet  even though you are a leap of faith away even though I say you seem as close as day is to night Not far today  or any other day or any other week any year I can seek because you are always in my heart where a best friend should be

      Never could I have imagined This to be so hard never could I have imagined Thought of peace to be so far Where you are Is where I long to be I have your eyes In my Radar It's just a short ride In my grey car In my mind I'll tell you your great, are You thinking of me?  Never could I have imagined My night could be So far away from me Why can't I fall Asleep? Why is this concept so difficult for me? Why Haven't I found self-conscience relief? Why can't I move on? Why is your voice still so pretty to me? I hear you in my head During the day and in my dreams I fear I haven't been fed My alloted dose of all the things I wish we could be I wish I could free My Mind climb down From this tall green tree Both feet on the ground Head out of the clouds I say out loud Let me be endowed with a gift to forget How well you could fit  Inside my arms In regards To my imagination Tearing me apart Never could I have imagined To let you go Man I wish I could  Read you this poem

      Looking Back Again The Facts and then All of the snuggles and thick puddles  of mud I want to put my coat  over for you my friend And in this time  it's safe to say I've never met a girl who looks this way Talks away  Walks in ways  Men Talk about  The way you look today I always say "I hope she never leaves my side," "Please Stay" But I wonder J, What our paths will bring us What attitudes will bring trust  And comfort in life  and self-esteem, and pride My eyes long to get lost in your eyes What a suprise  I was given, Still livin A year ago today When you simply walked up my way And now I say I am happy today This day I will hug and cherish ok?

      Hello my artistic friend christmas is coming again although our hugs did not last I hope our friendship will not pass I hope I can call you on the phone when your with people or home alone a few minutes we will chat about this or inevitably that Maybe we can see each other, for a tease I think we should go to chucky cheeze! We will laugh and shout and smile it will be fun for a while or we could sit and enlight each other; I never played guitar in the middle of the night for you, true, you never drew a cool picture for a fool  with spelling problems who knew a girl in school  but what to do? email Lady Boo?  or mabye come visit her when she is working at club libby loo either way it's cruel the man apart from a friend that he misses  makes me want to say boo-hoo as he fishes  for a way to catch  some time for her  maybe I will make you a batch of cookies brown chocalate chip we'll dip them in a tall glass of milk  then we will take a sip but oh this is all in my head and it's fed by the lonliness that's said you feel when your lying in bed I hate this place I hope this isn't a joke I hope you don't think I am messed up in the head like a coke after you shake it a few times then try to open  it and spray it all over my face  Don't mind me I just needed to write it takes the place of cheers, crying or when I am ready to fight It takes place of all those feelings bottled up when I feel like I have followed nothing instead of dreams and hopes and most importantly my heart so from start  to end to be offended by my pen it's just an poem email  to a friend  I wanted to send

      I miss you I miss me and you I miss seeing you I miss all of the things  We used to be and do Not just that past couple months  Not the last fatal tough  moments to deal with sad feelings I feal in my mind and my soul I really wish I didn't have to let you go I wish I could show you my whole  heart and go no where cause you are a part  of my spirit, my life my breath and my sight All I hear are the fights  But what I see is a fright- ened little girl's face Entrapted in a case Locked by security Blocked with out a trace of light  or of love It's my life I'd give up  for you  it's true I wish you  could have knew  The Anthony before he was compelled to do  The thing that is  So hard to forget I wish I could burn in Hell for this shit I wish I just had just a little more strength See my heart had been stabbed in the back with a steak Knife Over and over and over again By women and men and the ones I called friends but, what makes each day so hard to accept I made the biggest mistake as big mistakes could get I thought you were a scoundrel Trying to hurt me too I didn't know you still thought maybe I could be with you.  What I thought was hate, mistrust and disception Was really dying love, from a sweet girl upset with the things I have done The Thoughts I have thought The love I have crushed  The life I have sought Should've I gotten caught  with a smack to the head Been left for dead on my back  in my bed If it gives you a chance  to love me again to be my soulmate to be my sweet friend Then I take it away with each tear that I type I give you my life to do what you like Treat it right And maybe I can get a little sleep at night No more day dreams of you saying You want to try it a third time You have realized your love story You don't want to settle the score e- ven with the pain in the past We will move forward and last Until the end of time I'll be yours  You'll be mine Everything will be fine I'll bet a quarter, nickel and a dime Together we will reach 40, 50, seventy-two, ninety-eight Each day I will be rejoyed the day we decided not to wait And see if we could live from each other apart Ever since I met you, you gained control of my heart You breathed it life, You continue it's existance Without you Anthony Doria no longer fits in This world we live in The love you've given Keeps me alive when life looks grimmest All I can say, Please don't be finished Take a break from our relationship but,  Please Please, don't quit it Don't give up on the greatest love story ever to be written Your a kitten  and I'm a pup We have a lot of growing up to do so please don't give up Just take time to heal See how you feel I know the third time around Will be the charm and we will Understand why we met that one day Your ultimate beauty kept my silliness at bay What do you say? Could we just take some time off Let whatever pains heal Grow to a mature cat, an adult size dog.  Instead of running into a relationship  Try to take a small walk Down the beach  I could reach For your hand As we talk Everyday things What happenness means We will gently explore  Our Hearts and feelings We'll find our favorite restaurant We'll soon find our song But, best of all you might discover That you loved me all along

      poop poop poop on a stoop poop is brown goop not good in pea soup If you ever took a scoop of poop out of a group of seven chicken coops let it linger let it droop then scooped another group of poop from a rock group, Jazz group or rap group it's probably good to snoop through the 23rd girl scout troop make sure you didn't get duped into scooping up poop cause if you did get duped into scooping up poop by the 23rd girl scout group eating gum, playing hoola hoop then wish on them croupe take a moment, regroup hop on a plane,  cause it to make a ground loop maybe swoop down for some soup But not the brown soup with poop because you be right back where you started scooping the brown goop we call poop
