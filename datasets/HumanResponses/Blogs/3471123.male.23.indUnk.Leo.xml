       urlLink Lakers win again? 1:39PM   How is it that the Lakers keep winning!  So they have 4 future Hall of Famers... I just can't seem to dislike any team more.  It's something about the way they talk and play that makes me sick!  Maybe we'll all get lucky and either the Pistons or the Pacers will have the special sauce to beat those 4!

      Well, It's Thursday May 27th, 2004 and This is the first blog posting I've done.  I just got back from a business trip to Columbus Ohio and I'm enjoying living in the Washington D.C. Area for the summer with my Wife and both our in-law families.  Things are OK!

      We had a summer league game last night.  It was a lot of fun actually playing in a real league again.  It had been four years since I had played in a game with officials and I'm sure I don't have to write it, but you could tell from the way I played.  We lost 64-56 or something close to that, it was hard to tell at the end of the game.  Although the loss is bad news, the good news is that we have another game on Thursday.  A chance to make up for our suckiness. Hopefully that will go much better.

      Saturday was an beautiful day, and to celebrate my father in law and my brother in law decided to take me golfing for my first time.  It was actually a small best-ball tournament that our church was hosting.    It was a lot of fun, although I found that I am terrible at golf.  Although I was completely useless for most the day, the two nice strokes I had are keeping me thirsty for more!   We ended up coming in dead last for the tournament, but mostly because three of our four team members had never golfed or golf rarely.  We did hit 12 over par which isn't to bad for a group of mostly first time golfers.  We even had a few birdies on some holes.  All and all it was a successful day!

      So things interesting lately.  My commute this morning wasn't nearly painful, but that had to do with the federal holiday in honor of President Reagan.  The weather seems to be reflective of the day, it's been cold and drizzling.  We did see all the helicopters flying by our office building as they where following the group that was escorting the President to the National Cathedral.  I was amazed at how many influential and political leaders attended.  What an honor for an American Leader!    On another note, I helped my mom create her own weblog.  You can check it out here urlLink Cathy's Pictures   She's great with her digital camera.

      So yesterday I had the all time most terrible commute home from my job in Washington D.C.  I live in Northern Virginia and it usualy takes about an hour for me to get from my job to my house...  This is on a normal day.  Yesterday just straight up sucked!    I started from the office and headed towards the Metro stop... only to find that they had blocked off the entrence because of mechanical errors.  So I had to walk 10 minutes in the Hot Sun to get to the Metro.  I started on the Metro and because I was 10 minutes Late I had to stand all the way till I got to my stop.  this was for about 1 hr and 15 minutes because the metro stopped inbetween stations for about 15 minutes.  When I finally got off the Metro I made it to the bus but had to sit all the way at the back because all the seats were taken.  Usually this isn't bad but the bus I was on didn't have air conditioning and the venting system wasn't working right so instead of pumping diesal fumes away from the bus, it pumped them right inside to where I was sitting.  Now I wasn't only hot, but I was getting sickly high off of this stinky gas. To make things worse, the bus broke down about five minutes from my stop...  When it finally got moving again I made it to my car and sat in traffic for while untill I made it to my home.  The best news was that the commute was over.. For now.
