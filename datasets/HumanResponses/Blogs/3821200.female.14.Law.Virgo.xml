      im just sitting here, talking with my boy friend on AIM. im sooo tired, but i cant fall asleep. dontcha hate that?? its almost 4am and i havent gone to sleep yet. my bf is crazy but i love him so much. he stays up till 4am almost every morning, but still manages to get up at a sorta decent time. lols. i do it once and im whooped. im gonna miss him soooo much if we have to move. i really dont wanna. my bf is the first guy that ive ever actually loved. i hadent event gotten a crush on a guy for a few years before he moved here. my friends all say they were jealous when i got him. one of them said that she wanted to go after him, but when she found out that i was with him she backed off. i cant blame them. hes pretty hot =). theres this one girl that gets on my nerves still though. when ever im gone, and i come back, i always see her trying to hug him and  stuff like that. we were all at the beach, and she just happend to take off her top right as he walked by. it was really funny. he didnt even look and she got kinda pist off. i was laughing so hard. hes in love with me and shes got absolutely no chance of stealing him away from me. lols. im gonna go. bye

      omg. i might be moving to Tennessee. i really dont want to. ill miss my bf so much. everyone else too! the only way id be able to talk to them or any thing would be the internet or writing letters. lols. snail mail. my step dad just got offered to go to a post in Tennessee and he said that hes thinking aobut going. why?? when we get there hell be shipped off to Iraq or some crazy place like that. i dont get why hes even thinking about making the whole family move there. just cuz his mom lives there. its not like hell be there to see her! my whole family is here! why would he do that?  i thought my life was crazy, but i was talking to a friend today and i read her blog. dang. i really didnt realize how good my life really is. its insane my parents are really driving me nuts with this whole," were ur parents!! we have to care!! so that means we have to no everything ur doing, where ur going, when ull be back, and everything else!!" theyre even asking me how far ive gone with my bf. is that any of their business?? hell no!! its none of their business. if i wanted to have sex, i woulda had it by now! i mean, weve only been going out for a year and a half mother!! if we really wanted to do it wed find a way! theres no way to prevent it! cept for moving of corse. maybe thats part of the reason he wants to move so much. o boy, thats great. im gonna go. bye
