      Listening to: Hoobastank - Crawling in the Dark Feeling: Sleepy  Oh yeah! I did it! Woo hoo! I signed on! Hello readers! I am the sister of the blogger. Right now she is at show choir camp singing to her heart's content, well, hopefully, I haven't really talked to her, but I assume she is. It is nice to have her sing somewhere else besides here and having the room to myself. It has been lovely, have a good night!

      Today me and my sister had to clean our room. it was a complete mess and she thought it wouldnt take long but i knew it would take all day and i was right we started around 1:30 and we didnt finish until 7:45 pm. but its all worth it because now you can see evey piece of the floor that was supposed to be shown because i would always cover it up so noone would see the mess but now its actually clean! :D But then that means when i get back from showchoir camp my room will be clean! (hopefully)

      Today i was forced to go to the dentist because of my tooth and the dentist assistant that i was given was a really hot guy! Also he was really nice. but the dentist i was given wasnt my usual dentist and he was the one that lied to me when i was younger he told me that the numbing shot would feel like a mosquito bite but it was Worse so now i call him the evil dentist! Ryan (the dental assistant) was really hot! but the only problem was that he was way older and was i think as tall as me!

      Last night i spent the night at my friend Chrissy's house! we went online and i talked to the people she met in chatrooms. 2 of her ex online boyfriends kept hitting on me! it was so funny. this one guy i talked to chrissy told me tell him she was sleeping and chrissy told me to meantion her name and see what happens. nothing happened he ignored it! it was so funny. But that guy is also an asshole so who gives a shit! then i talked to this guy marrell and chrissy told him not to hit on me because he usually hits on every girl he talks too. He actually listened to her! it was a fun night at her house!

      Today  me and my brother Josh saw the movie saved! it was ok. they could of made it alot better! but i have to say that this is one of the good movie Mandy Moore was in. Mandy Moore ends up being the bitch of the movie though just the Princess Diaries except she was the bitch in the whole movie. also when me and my brother were watching it everyone around us was making noise! it was really annoying and the guy sitting next to me kept talking to his wife during the movie! Also when we were going to sit in the theatre i saw someone i knew from an acting camp i went to! it was good to see her even though she was flirting with a guy and  i think i interupted it.

      When the tampa bay lightening won the stanley cup i was so excited! Me and my friend stephanie were talking on the commericals about the game and we were complaining about how many commericials there were! and every time we scored a goal we kept going on about it and at the end we were soooo excited for the bolts. Stephanie said that Brad Richards (the mvp)was so "sexay" (her words exactly). haha

      Yesterday me and my  friend Chrissy talked about going to Busch Gardens! I might be going with her and her friend Winn! I hope I can go because I want to ride Roller Coasters! (Wow i just sounded like Jamie) Ive only been on 3 roller coasters that liked Montu, Kumba, and Gwazi and when we went to Busch Gardens in March with my school i was forced to go on a roller coaster (i was terrified of them at the time) and i loved it! (all thanks to Jamie who forced me) and after that we went on Montu, Kumba, and Gwazi all twice! the 2nd time on Gwazi we got to duel so that was cool. So now I like roller coasters all thanks to my friends pushing me on them at Busch Gardens! haha

      Its summer! The 2 things bad about summer is that i have to do summer reading and that my friends Neliann and Jamie arent comming back! Neliann ive known sinse 2nd grade and been friends with her since and Jamie ive known since 6th grade and im going to miss them alot! They are one of my best friends! Thats one thing that will never change! Also summer reading thats the worst thing about summer i have to read 3 books, write a journal of every chapter of every book i read and do a project on my required book! But its alot better than what the honors class has to do! They have to do the samething but they have to read 4 books! Haha sucks for them!

      My sister always makes fun of me! If i do something stupid she runs and tells everyone in my house! Its sooo annoying. Its like I cant tell her anything stupid without her saying something to someone else! I still love her and all but i just wish she didnt tell people every single stupid thing i do or say!
