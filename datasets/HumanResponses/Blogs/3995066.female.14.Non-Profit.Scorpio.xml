       Have you ever thought that a friend could possibly love you more than any other person? This is an adequate feeling, in which persists in my mind as well as my heart. I feel as if I am falling into an unknown heaven, the closest era of happiness.    &nbsp;  I believe I am falling faster as the days drag on. He calls, we talk enjoy our own company, yet we have not gone further. Maybe, we are ashamed? Maybe, we are scared? All I know, is if this continues, I may have to create another scar. I feel love and happiness surrounding me. I just hope I am not mistaken.    &nbsp;  Old friends have come to me, asking for time together. Maybe I will. Maybe I will go back to my terrible habits, hell, they are the only friends who have never betrayed me. Maybe I will. I miss the smell of smoke, the rush of danger, and the happiness of laughter. Ah, yes, I am born again.

       Introspection has been reocurring for the past hours. I have thought of my past, the pain, pressure, and hopes to die. My wrist forever shows my past, so I shall never forget.  &nbsp;  The realization of hate towards oneself creates an apparent disease. I myself have longed to stop this life and the silliness it portrays. Why live? When all you have to live for is an Eating Disorder and fake beauty? I see no point. I simply thought that I should kill myself quickly, then slowly. I thought wrong. I realized suicide was the absolute longest way for me to die. I always tried to build up my courage, downsize my pride. It took years for me to finally cut deep enough to die. But, with scared techniques, I survived. Now, I live with these haunting scars.  &nbsp;  The reason I thought of these moments was from a suicide note I found in my room. Followed behind it was another one. I found 5 suicide notes simultaneously. Odd? Yes, very. I wonder if I parted this earth, if I would visit. Follow my friends. Strengthen their lives, to see they did not have the same fate. Goodness, I am such a sweet heart.  &nbsp;  I feel emptiness gather when I think of him. The man/boy I love. He cannot be a man, since he is too immature to realize logical reasons of my love for him. Why do whores seem to gather more men? Is it sex? Is it beauty? Is it fame? I never shall know, but I am simply to conservative I guess. But, I refuse to extinguish my pride for him. Love may be the cause, but self-hatred will never be the symptom.  &nbsp;  Poetry has been pouring out of my fingertips. Love, hate, passion. All categories felt and ever wanted. I feel in love with my mind, for it has been owrking well over time, and exceeding it's own capabilities. Hopefully, I will become recognized, and distribute my words to the world.
