      Well, its been quite awhile since I actually posted a new blog hasn't it.  Well ever since I've really gotten back from Daytona's I've been working.  Almost every day.  But it's paid off.  I can now have some decent presents to give to everyone for Christmas.  And I can now get some clothes that I want for school, and maybe some extra's.  It's only been a week and I miss Day already, like, everytime we hook up, it seems that the fun just doubles the last time.  And the situations don't always hafta be the best, but hey, that's the way it goes.  i am going to B.C. on Sunday, and it's going to be a loooooong drive.  But at least we have some time that we can spend with grandma and grandpa.  the its a loooooooong drive back.  Hooray!  NOOOOOOOO!  Anyways, I don't really have anything else to say, but you know that If I do I'll post it on hurr.  Have fun people Let go,  Trav-Man

      Well, the firs post is upon us...Hm...well, I just got back from Day's.&nbsp; Man, was that ever wicked fun, well, most of the time.&nbsp; Her boyfriend came over and he was pretty cool, better than his cousin, thats for sure.&nbsp; Dan, well, he needs a kick in the head, or two, or repeat as necessary.&nbsp; She burned me a whole bunch of Cd's, form like Offspring to Guns and Roses, to Slipknot, it was pretty cool.&nbsp;  We even got a lil picture and modelling time in too.&nbsp; That was wicked fun, the pictures turned out great, even thouh I didn't get the goofy one, with me falling into her arms, dramatic style.&nbsp; It was pretty funny.&nbsp; i hated to leave her so early, like, we've been helping each other whenever we feel like crap.&nbsp; It sucks, like, I wouldv'e liked to spend like a week with her.&nbsp; I don't know though, my 'rents are a lil dumb about the whole thing.&nbsp; Anyways, I'm out...
