      Here i am in California, and again on the Internet.  I think i should go out, but oh well.  Money needs to be made.   I was hoping to have my  urlLink California Hotels  website up by the time I got here, but that didnt happen due to Kirat hurting her wrist.   Anyways, ill probably give an update of my travels later.

      I just put up a travel page on antelopetravel.com  The site used to be run by a travel agency named  urlLink Antelope Travel .  It seems that the agency merged with another, so they no longer needed to keep this domain name.  Hopefully there's still some traffic going to the domain name that I can capitalize on.

      I'm always thinking about the future, about what im going to do next.  Sometimes my ideas are pretty shitty, but right now my previous ideas seem to have gone pretty well.   Yesterday I spent $105 on Google Adwords.  439 Click-throughs, I made about $100 in opti-fees.  So my advertising plan is going pretty much on track for now.  My opti-fees are paying for my advertising, and the actual commissions are my profits.  For yesterday that would be about $340US.  Not bad for a guy who did nothing most of the day, I went paintballing, and the rest of the day I did other things which had nothing to do with work.  The future is looking bright.   My  urlLink Montreal Hotels  website has been doing fairly well recently, and i havent even been advertising it, hopefully it will continue, and become something like my  urlLink Calgary Hotels  website, a consistent earner.   I got a domain name apprasial done today for  urlLink Monterey HQ , Sedo.com said the domain was worth $1200US.  But I dont think that appraisal takes into account all the links on the net to the website, including one on Yahoo.  I'm going to keep my website price up at $2500, considering those links and the website with its content.   I'm going to  urlLink Harrison Hot Springs  in the morning, see how business is there.  I spent more than 5 years living there, but have rarely been there in the last year and half.  Should be interesting.

      I dont know what it is but i am very  BORED  maybe i need to go away somewhere.  Which i will be doing in two weeks anyways, to California.  Maybe i should visit  urlLink Monterey  while im down there.  I still have to book my flight, but im going for sure.   Today was a boring day, i didnt really do much.  Checked my adwords stats quite a few times though.  Im spending more on Adwords than im receiving through opti-fees, which wasnt the plan.  So tomorrow im going to cut down a bit on my adwords CPC and see how that works.  I need to make it balance out, and then keep it like that.  I cant really complain though, i think i still made more than $300 today after paying the ad expenses.  I'm not just sitting back though.  I might be getting someone to make unique content for me, so i can develop CanadianTourist.com.  I think it will cost me somewhere in the $2500 range to get it up, but the way im seeing it right now, the site will have some 500 pages of unique content, if i link my hotel sites to it, i could easily make that $2500 back in a few months and then it will be all profit.   The site will sort of be like my  urlLink Vancouver Tourist  site, but different.   I have  urlLink Monterey HQ  up for sale.  I'm hoping it sells, i dont know if there's much use of the site.  It really isnt performing that well for me yet.  I need it to have a Google Pagerank.   I have websites in  urlLink Sudbury ,  urlLink Barrie ,  urlLink Kitchener ,  urlLink Oshawa ,  urlLink Guelph  and  urlLink Windsor Ontario  that arent doing anything yet.  Lets hope they start soon.

      I dont know if anyone reads this blog. But i dont really care, because I know the search engine bots are going through and spidering my blog on a daily basis. They are picking up the link placement to my sites ( urlLink Hyatt Regency Bellevue  is a nice hotel) and spidering them as well. I dont know if its working at all yet, but i might as well as try for a while, and see how it goes.  Out of all the hotels in Vancouver, the  urlLink Westin Bayshore Hotel  probably has the nicest location. Its not right in the busy are of downtown, but its also not too far. The proximity to Stanley Park is pretty damn good too.  I didnt win that gamebros.com domain name the other day, it went for $454US! Way beyond my budget. I guess the people bidding on it valued it more than me. So i guess ill stick to Hotels for now. Probably better that i do that since i'm experienced in the hotel industry, after working at the Executive Hotel in  urlLink Harrison Hot Springs  for 5 years.  I guess thats all for today in terms of my gratuitous link placement, ill be back tomorrow with more :D  P.S. Remember to visit my  urlLink Winnipeg Hotels  website.

      The last three days have been very good.  Its 3:45 on the Friday, but since Wednesday morning, ive made about $1400CAD.  So far this month im on pace to hit over $9000 by the end of the month.  But you know what? I've decided thats not good enough.   I've decided once again to increase my Adwords budget, and by the time i add all the keywords for all the different cities, i should be paying about $100US a day for clicks.  Just over 400 clicks a day to my websites.  I'm hoping at least 5% of those visitors book, making 20 reservations, more than $50US back in opti-fees and more than $150US in commissions.  Leaving me with more than $100US additional profit each day.   Now i just need to figure out a way of fitting $2500 - $3000US each month on a credit card.  I might need to make credit balances on the card so that the transactions go through.   Well this is just a plan for now, who knows if it will work, ill try it out for the next week or so.  If my bookings keep rising, ill know something is working.  I need to fix a few of my sites up as well, make them more user friendly.  I just added my  urlLink Vancouver Hotels ,  urlLink Banff Hotels ,  urlLink Calgary Hotels  and  urlLink Edmonton Hotels  websites on my Google Adwords campaign.  There are so many damn keywords for each of those sites.

      I thought yesterday was just a blip, and that my websites would be normal today, somewhere in the $150 to $200 range.  But again i was way above average at about $450 today on 33 reservations.   I really noticed my PPC ads working well for me today.  At least 10-12 of the reservations I received were directly conversions from the ads.  I've decided to expand the advertising, increasing my daily budget on Google Adwords to $30/day.  With a maximum CPC of 30 cents.  If i have another day like today, tomorrow, i think ill have to increase the daily budget again.    I received a few reservations today from my  urlLink Barrie Hotels  website, which is nice, finally making some of the sites i did in June are paying off for me.  Hopefully some of the others will be producing soon as well.   Someone made eight reservations in Mt. Vernon Washington today.  I'm guessing those reservations went through my  urlLink Bellingham Hotels  website.   For some reason the  urlLink Executive Hotel Harrison Hot Springs  website has been dropping for the keyword 'harrison hot springs' on Google for the past year.  We used an SEO company, that didnt work, once we changed our website early this year its been worse.  Hopefully it will pick up soon.

      Well it is the middle of the summer right now, so I should be expecting my best days for hotel reservations to be taking place right now.  Yesterday I made the most money from my websites than any other day so far.  Close to $600 in one day.  Not bad for sitting on my ass doing practically nothing.   I like the idea of making money and not doing very much.  Who doesnt like that idea?  But sometimes i feel lazy and want to do more.  If i actually worked hard at this, i could easily be making much more money.  Thats why im accumulating so many damn domain names, I have these great ideas to do so much more, but it usually doesnt go anywhere.  I've back ordered Gamebros.com through pool.com.  Its up for auction right now, and ive bid $80US for it.  If i get it, i think that will be my foot into the video game affiliate business door.   Yesterday I put  urlLink Monterey HQ  up for sale on Sedo.com as a developed website.  I really need Google to give it a page rank soon though, otherwise it wont sell.  I'm asking for $2500US which may be a little excessive.  But then again the people who used to run it might not think so.  Lets see how that goes.  Yesterday I showed someone this blog, I asked them not to laugh.  They actually thought it was good.  Which doesnt really make sense to me.

      When I started affiliate marketing in the summer of 2001, I first made a four seasons hotels website.  The aim of the website was to make it look like the actual four seasons website, with their logo etc.  The domain name was even four-seasons-hotels.com  I linked hotel reservations for the site through travelnow.com.  Because the website didnt have any traffic, I paid for clicks through goto.com which is now overture.com.   A week after i had the site up i paid about $200 for clicks and had about $1000 in commissions.  It was a great success, especially for my first try at it.  Unfortunately the success didnt last long, I got a notice from travelnow.com that Four Seasons sent them a letter from their lawyers to stop the reservations from my site.   Whats the point of telling you this? Well rich people are great, they spend lots of money on things.  There werent actually that many reservations through that four seasons website i made, but each one was a big commission.  5% of a $1000 reservation is $50.  Compared to some of the measly 5% of $69 i get ($3.45 commission), those four seasons commissions were GREAT.   Today someone booked the  urlLink Fairmont Banff Springs Hotel  for 3 nights at $381.97US per night.  My commission on the booking was over $100US.  I have to say that I was quite happy receiving the email confirming the booking.   My websites sell rooms for some other luxury hotels including the  urlLink Four Seasons Toronto , the  urlLink Pan Pacific Hotel Vancouver  and the  urlLink Ritz Carlton Montreal .  Lets hope some more Rich people visit my websites and book.

      Today i decided that its time to start spending some money advertising my websites.  I'm doing it on a trial basis, ive chosen search keywords for some of my sites, and will be monitoring how that goes.  I deposited $50 with Overture and have put a $5 per day limit on advertising with Google.  I'll be monitoring the results everyday to see how it goes.   Just now I received an email from Google, tell me that one of the terms ive submitted for advertising has been rejected.  ' urlLink Holiday Inn Express Bellingham ' was rejected because:   "We have disapproved the trademark term "Holiday Inn" and/or variations of this keyword in your Google AdWords campaign."     Some of the hotel chains have been fairly aggressive with their internet marketing, trying to prevent people like me from taking a share of the business through our websites.  The group that runs the Holiday Inns arent so bad though, they sent me an email a few weeks ago asking me to join their very own affiliate program.  With them paying as much as 7% for a reservation.  Less than they would pay to a travel agent, but still a pretty good commission for me.  I havent taken them up on the offer yet.

      When you surf the internet you surely see websites which have no real purpose and they have sponsored listings all over them.  Alot of them are expired domain names or domain names which have good names and receive significant traffic.  The website owners receive income from people visiting the websites and clicking on the listings.   I just signed up with Sedo.com's parked domain name service.  I have a few expired domain names, one of them  urlLink reston-va.com  im putting up on there service, lets see how that goes.   I had my first $5k month in July,  i'm trying to match that in August.  Hopefully by september ill have sites like  urlLink Hotels Reservations Canada  and  urlLink California Hotels  going and i can keep the income flowing in.

      I've been wondering about blogging for some time.  I dont know why people like posting random things on blogs, i really dont see the purpose.  But I thought i would try it out for a while and see how it goes.   I've been making websites for some time.  The websites are not for others, but for myself, i make money mainly through affiliate programs, hotel affiliate programs to be more precise. As well as through Google Adsense.   Right now I probably have somewhere in the range of 60 websites, and I make a decent income from them.  If anyone reading this wants to make a hotel reservation in  urlLink Toronto ,  urlLink Vancouver  or Perhaps  urlLink Seattle , I have websites which can help you with that.    One of my more successful websites is for  urlLink Calgary Hotels .   I've been looking at doing other types of affiliate programs recently, but havent had the chance yet to do that.  There are so many affiliate programs out there, that its hard to figure out which one would be the best to do.   I've been researching different affiliate programs recently in order to diversify myself a bit.  Hopefully ill find something soon that will be a money maker.
