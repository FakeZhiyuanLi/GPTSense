      So I just took both finals for my first Summer Session courses today. PoliSci 10 went well, and I felt pretty confident about almost all of the exam; PoliSci 12 was a little worse - I felt good about the essay, but not so good about 2 of the 5 IDs.  So I did what any good student does; take your best guess, and try to make a little humor, hoping the TA will laugh when grading and give me a few more points. :D  So how long of a break do I get until the second Summer Session classes start? Oh. I get the weekend off. Yay me.  Crap... I need a break.

      Hello everyone!      I am posting this as a warning to all of you, who may be thinking of purchasing something from the Internet at any time. This is not spam, and is entirely from my own experience. The details in this story are facts, and happened to me over this last week. Please feel free to pass this on to anyone you'd like; this is meant to serve as a warning, and hopefully to prevent you from having horrible customer service, like I have.      Over the last week, I've been browsing the Internet for a certain pair of speakers, Harmon Kardon Soundsticks (USB version). These have been discontinued by HK, but are still available online. I did some searching, and saw that not only did Buy.com list them at the lowest online price ($165), but included free shipping. Because Buy.com's warehouse is located only a few hours north of me, it should take only a day of in-route shipping to get here.      Before ordering, I sent them an e-mail on Wednesday to try and find out if they were new-in-box or refurbished speakers. After not getting a response by Friday, I figured I'd bite the bullet and take a chance; after all, I wanted the speakers either way.      I placed my order at 10:30am PST (1:30pm EST) on Friday; Buy.com's web site states that in-stock items usually ship same day if ordered by 4:30pm EST (1:30pm PST) - I obviously met this requirement. I checked their website around 4pm PST, to see if it had shipped. It was listed as being "Sent to Warehouse". As you guys know, companies sometimes take a while to update their websites and with the weekend, I wasn't overly concerned.      Monday rolls around, and I still haven't gotten a shipping confirmation e-mail, and their website still listed my order as "Sent to Warehouse". I sent Buy.com an e-mail through their website asking for a status update. (Side note: Still no reply to the first e-mail I sent on Wed.) I went to school and didn't get a chance to think about it further until the afternoon. Around 3pm, there was still no update via e-mail or website. I attempted to find a phone number on their website to call, but there was none - at all. I thought this was odd, and tried a Google search for their contact information, which turned up nothing. I decided to do a WHOIS search on their domain, and got a phone number through that. But, it was past 5pm now, and I waited to call until Tuesday.      Tuesday morning, still no new information on my order. I called the number, and got over to an order representative. She informed me that the speakers I wanted were on "surprise backorder", and had been for over two weeks. (Surprise backorder? Was there suddenly a rush on discontinued 2 year-old USB-based speakers?) They had no ETA as to when they might come in stock. But wait, doesn't their website list them as in-stock? They sure do - and the lady had no idea why. Why was I not informed of their stock status before, during or after placing my order? She had no idea, and apologized. I was upset at this point, mostly for wasting nearly 4 days waiting for speakers they didn't have, but decided to see what other Internet retailers had the speakers, and simply take my business elsewhere.      5 minutes later, I checked eCost.com, and found they had them for only $169.99; not too much more, and they also had free shipping. I called the phone number CLEARLY shown on the top of their web site, and confirmed they were in stock. I placed my order, and less than 15 minutes later, was very happy again. I decided to call Buy.com and cancel my order. Upon getting a hold of a customer service rep, she kindly took my request to cancel the order.      Fast forward to 3:30pm PST. My order from eCost.com has already shipped, and should be here tomorrow (Wednesday). Then I get an e-mail from Buy.com. It seems that "Unfortunately, this item has already entered the fulfillment process and we were unable to cancel it." Wait - how has it entered fulfillment? They can't ship or bill me, because they don't have the product. And they have no ETA on getting the product; so how can they not cancel the order? (Keep in mind, they have an authorization charge on my credit card for the speakers; their policy, however, is not to complete the charge until the item ships.) I call them once again, and the customer service rep informs me that she cannot just cancel the order; they have to e-mail a "request to cancel" to another department. Wait, what? How does that make sense? You take the order, you can cancel the order. Who does business like this? At this point, I'm getting upset and ask to speak to a supervisor.      A supervisor finally gets on the line and insists that he can't do anything. I grill him about their policies and how they operate for nearly 30 minutes, but he still only apologizes and says he can't do anything other than e-mail this other department. When I asked about this department, he confirmed they were in the same building - but he couldn't call them OR physically go there to them. I ask to speak to his supervisor; he's the "most senior person on duty". When asking for anyone higher, there's no one there. Now he's really pissing me off. I ask him how his company can operate by lying to customers, stealing their money and then ignoring them. Still nothing but apologies and "we can only send a request to cancel the order". I remind him that one request has already been refused, and ask what will be different this time around; he has no answer.      Fine; let's sumbit another request. How long will this take? "You shold have a reply to the request in 3-5 business days." Wait, what the hell? Not a cancellation - a reply; they can simply say NO again. And I have to wait 3-5 business days for this? Now I'm pissed; and as most of you know, you don't piss off a Heltsley. ;) I tell him to send the request, and tell him that his company sucks and hang up.      I call back, get the operator and ask for their legal department. After the transfer, I find that most everyone has gone home (it's near 5pm PST now), but the lady there takes a message and promises someone will get back to me within 24 hours. At this point, I reply to their "refusal to cancel" e-mail and re-iterate that I want my order cancelled, now. I also call my credit card company, but they can't block the charge approval; they tell me to refuse the item if it does get shipped to me and then call them back, and they'll get my money back.      So, here I am. Lied to by website, ignored via e-mail, and money stolen by a company with questionable business practices. So I do what any American does - tell everyone he knows never to buy from them again. As most of you have worked in retail at one point or another, you know the saying: An angry customer tells 10 friends never to shop there again. Well, I'm letting you know and asking you to pass on the story (in whole or part, your choice) to anyone you know. I know it won't really hurt their business, but if I can prevent any of my friends from suffering as I have, I'll feel better.      I'll feel better after having a chat with their legal department tomorrow, as well. ;)   - John

       urlLink Dark Horizons: News - Weekend Box-Office, July 23rd-25th 2004   At the box office this weekend, "the Bourne Supremacy" ranked first place, with just over $50 million in ticket sales. Since the movie only cost around $75 million to make, I think it's safe to say that Universal will have writers hard at work to draft a script good enough to get Matt Damon back for a third installment. Yup, you heard me right - I'm calling it.  Let's look at this: "the Bourne Identity" cost about $45 million to make, and raked in over $110 million worldwide, not including DVD sales/rentals. "the Bourne Supremacy" cost $75 million to make, and in its first weekend  alone , it made back two-thirds of the total cost - and it hasn't gone worldwide or sold/rented any DVDs yet! This movie should make close to $200 million, making it simply stupid if Universal can't get a script done for a third installment in this franchise.  But here's the catch: Damon has said, as I mentioned before, that he won't make a sequel just to make money. (Which is the right attitude.) He'll only do another film if the script equals or exceeds the previous film(s). You can bet Universal is going to have writers working off their butts to get him back; if they don't, it won't be because the movie was bad or didn't make money - it'll be because Universal failed to turn out a good script.

       urlLink CNN.com - New 'Star Wars' movie title revealed - Jul 25, 2004   Yesterday, at San Diego's International Comic Convention (aka ComicCon), LucasFilms announced the title of the third "Star Wars" prequel. The movie will be titled "Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith".  Company fan relations director, Steve Sansweet, made the announcement in lieu of George Lucas. Lucas, the founder of LucasFilms and creator of the "Star Wars" movies, rarely attends conventions and is currently working in post-production on this, the sixth film in the franchise.   While filming the final movie of the original trilogy, Lucas released promotional information and material stating that the movie would be called "Revenge of the Jedi". However, he later changed the name after deciding that revenge was not very Jedi-like. The film became "Return of the Jedi" instead.  This title is due to upset some fans and please others, much like announcement of the titles for the previous prequels. Many fans feel that the prequel's titles are too childish and "hokey-sounding". However, older fans realize that these titles are a homage to the serial Science-Fiction films of the 1940s and 1950s. (And really, they're no worse than the original trilogy's titles; Come on, "A New Hope", "the Empire Strikes Back"? That fits right in with "the Phantom Menace" and "Attack of the Clones".) Also, with each of the prequels nearly mirroring the events and tones of the original trilogy, having the final prequel named "Revenge of the Sith" gives a sense of closure to the series and returns to where the original movies ended.  I like it. Now, let's just hope there are no references to midi-chlorians, and Jar-Jar is in this film about as much as the second.     (Editor's Note: No, I wasn't on-hand to see the announcement myself, or even hear about it fom the screaming and cheering. However, I was supposed to be. Instead, I was at home helping paint my mother's living room. Yay for me.)

      To make a long story short: WOW.  Here's more, though:  This movie picks up two years after the end of the Bourne Identity. Jason Bourne and Marie are now living in Goa, India. (Shown at the end of the first film, but never identified.) At the same time, a CIA group is covertly attempting to purchase evidence that a mole inside the Agency stole $20 million in funds; an assassin shows up, kills both the CIA buyer and the seller, steals $3 million in US cash and the files; he then plants a fingerprint of Bourne's. The assassin then goes to India and attempts to kill Bourne. The chase is on, with the CIA hunting Bourne, and Bourne hunting the CIA trying to find out why and more about his past. (He still doesn't know everything about himself, but remembers small bits here and there.)  Thankfully, the movie doesn't follow the second book at all; after the Bourne Identity, the Bourne novels by Ludlum got real boring and repetitive... Similar to how Tom Clancy nearly ran the Jack Ryan franchise into the ground. Matt Damon delivers another wonderful performance as Bourne, and Brian Cox, returning as the former head of Bourne's CIA black-ops squad, delivers a wonderful performance as well. The movie progresses very rapidly, and they fit a lot of story into a short time. I won't say much more, because to do so would risk revealing the plot. The action scenes were very well scripted, and on the whole, the movie is very solid.   The ending is very similar to the first movie: it can serve as either an end to the series, or as the opening to a third movie. Damon has said that he doesn't feel a need to do a third film, because he doesn't like sequels made "just to make money"; but if they made another script that was equal to, or better, than the first two, he'd strongly consider it.   You've got to love an actor who says things like that. And in my (humble) opinion, I'd like to go on record as predicting the following: If this movie does well, and "professional" reviews are good, you can bet Universal will have writers working hard to make a strong follow-up. And if they make it right, Damon will sign on for a third film. However, I'm with Damon on this one: they should make it ONLY if it lives up to the first two; otherwise, leave it alone. However, the ending of this movie is such that it begs... no, screams for a sequel. Here's to hoping the Bourne Supremacy does well, so that a third and final chapter can be scripted.

      Sorry I haven't updated the site with anything in the last few days... I've had a few things going on that have been keeping me occupied. With luck, they should be taken care of in the next few days, so I'll be in a better mood.  Here's big news, though: my parents finally replaced the upstairs air conditioner. This is HUGE. Instead of my room being 85-90 degrees during the day, it's down to about 75-78 degrees. For those of you who haven't seen my room, it's on the upstairs corner of the house, and has six windows... Three on the east side, and three on the west. (I've got a great story about the windows, and the gated community we live in, but that's for another time.) Because my room faces the east and west, I get sun on my room the entire daylight period, making it REAL FREAKING HOT. In fact, if you take an indoors thermometer and stand just outside my doors, and compare the readings, you'll get a variation of 8-10 degrees. And that's from walking 3 feet through a doorway into my room, because the hallway doesn't get ANY sun on it. Bleh... I hate the house we live in, but that's another story, too.

      So, the 2004 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby just ended. And since the only sport I like better than swimming is baseball, I've got to talk about this.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the specifics of this contest, let me fill you in. Eight hitters are chosen from Major League Baseball, 4 from the National League and 4 from the American League. Each batter gets to hit, and gets 10 "outs"; anything other than a home run is considered an out. If the player doesn't swing the bat, the pitch doesn't count. There are three rounds, with 4 people eliminated after the first, 2 in the second, and then one batter is left the champion. That's it.   Miguel Tejada (Orioles) surprised many people by winning, hitting a total of 27 home runs in Houston's Minute Maid Park. He also hit the longest home run, at 497 feet. (Dead center is only 435 feet.)  I thought Lance Berkman (Astros) would win; it's his home park, after all, and he's a monster at the plate. Well, he didn't disappoint me, making it into the final round and finishing with 21 home runs and the second longest at 493 feet.   However, let's look at some of the others: Sammy Sosa (Cubs) hit 5, and didn't escape the first round. Barry Bonds (Giants) hit 11, and didn't get out of round 2. Jim Thome (Phillies), the current Major League home run leader with 28 home runs, only hit 4 and never left round one.  The good news is, that this means nothing. It's simply surprising. They're not hurt, and this contest doesn't impact anything for the season or their teams. It's just surprising that three guys with that much power and ability hit a combined total of 20 home runs, with a LOT less pressure than is on them during a normal game.   Ah well, that's part of what makes baseball such a fun sport.

       urlLink Voodoo Extreme: Bethesda to Develop & Publish Fallout III   Here's the perfect opportunity for everyone to experience another (potentially) outstanding game in an already storied franchise, developed by a talented company.   Now that I've said that, I just hope this game won't suck. Fallout is one of the best RPG game series of all time, and Bethesda is a skilled developer of RPG games. (They made all of the Elder Scrolls games, which younger players may know best from their XBox/PC game, Elder Scrolls 3: Morrowind; this was the best in the series.)  If Bethesda doesn't make this game live up to the expectations that are already soaring, I'm organizing a Jim Jones-esque "There are no more RPGs" cult. Who's with me?  Afterthought: I think I really just dated myself with that last reference.

      So, I'm broke. Well, not really. I've got a few grand in the bank, but since I don't have a job, I'm saving as much money as I can; I do have to pay for school, gas, bills and food. Ah well, such are the perils of a student and one who is having a hard time finding a job right now.  In addition, there's been a definite lack of quality games being released lately. Games like likes of Halo, Half-Life, Deus Ex, System Shock 2 and Max Payne (which define genres) are few and far between. The next two likely candidates to join their ranks are Halo 2, Doom 3 and Half-Life 2; these are all due out later this year, but there hasn't been anything else even worth trying out lately. So what's a gamer to do? And don't forget a broke gamer...  If you're me, you revert to your roots... I pulled out my PlayStation games, plus my NES and SNES. Yes, I still own them, and almost all of the games I ever owned for all systems. (Some, once beaten, were sold at garage sales long ago.) I decided to start with the NES, playing through and re-enjoying classics such as Final Fantasy, ExciteBike, Zelda, Mike Tyson's PunchOut!, Contra, Metal Gear, and Castlevania.  ** Side story: I can't avoid mentioning this after bringing up Final Fantasy; such are the memories that awaken. When I lived in Virginia, my best friend (Ryan Mangels) and I used to sleep over at each other's homes on weekends and during the summer, and play NES (and later SNES) games until the wee hours of the morning. In Final Fantasy, there was a monster called WarMech that only appeared in one small section of a map, exactly 15 spaces long. And each time you stepped on one of these spaces, you had something like a 1 in 600 chance of meeting it. Nintendo Power (yes, I was a yearly subscriber) had a contest after the game came out: if you met WarMech, took a photo and mailed it in, you were entered and had a chance to win a live Final Fantasy adventure, hosted by Square and Nintendo. Well, on October 31 around 11 at night, we finally met WarMech; Ryan paused the game, while I ran upstairs from my basement to get my mother's camera. We took a few pictures of the screen, and then started to read how to send it in... Turn out the contest ended October 31 - we lost out. But I kept the pictures, and taped one of them to the underside of my Final Fantasy cartridge. Everytime I break it out, I always look back on those good times. I miss those days, don't you, Ryan? Oh yeah, and our characters got raped by WarMech, too. We had to restart from a save, and re-do the Tower of Wind. Yay. **  One of my many regrets is that my mother sold my Atari 5200 and games at a garage sale many years before. (My uncle worked for Atari once upon a time, and got me the system and ALL games for it one Christmas...) Pole Position, Asteroids, Missle Commander, Dig Dug and more... All gone. :(  The SNES holds many more games, as well as memories. Final Fantasy II and III (the best of the series, EVER), Zelda 3, Mario Kart, ChronoTrigger and F-Zero remain among some of the best over-all console games ever created, even to this day. Those of you questioning this comment need to realize that flashy graphics don't make games better - story and characters do. If you doubt me, play Final Fantasy 3; these characters have virtues and faults, and the villian (Kefka) is pure EVIL. I'd write a dissertation on this, but a wise young man named Brian Clevinger has already done so. You can read it  urlLink here . While you're there, check out his sprite comic, 8-bit Theater; it's base comedy at its purest.  I've also gone through my PlayStation games; Final Fantasy 7, Metal Gear Solid, Tomb Raider, Mortal Kombat 3, and the revisions of Final Fantasy I and II (Japan) are classics that cannot be avoided.  My point? Damned if I know. I guess I just love pointing out that the gamers today have no idea what REAL games are, and are missing out on some of the best games ever created. You don't need flashy summoning scenes, FMV sequences or multiple DVD-disc games to have fun; you just need the right games, which aren't often made anymore. If any of you young gamers are reading this, go to E-Bay or GameStop; pick up a used NES or SNES and some classic games... You'll have some of the best fun in your young lives and see what crap game designers are passing off on you today. And for the older gamers, if you've still got your systems, break them out. Memories of days past are lurking, and they want out. You won't regret it. Me? I'm already hitting up E-Bay for old games I've lost or sold.

      If you know me in real life, you already know this about me. But for those who don't, I'm a HUGE fan of professional swimming. I used to swim in high school, and still do it for fun and to stay in shape. Now, I was above average in high school, but nowhere near good enough to do anything with it. But it's fun, a great workout, and exciting to watch.  NBC is broadcasting the US Olympic Trials from Long Beach, taped earlier today. My first comment is that I'm pissed that I forgot it was going on - I would have driven up there to see this live.  Michael Phelps is an 18 year-old phenom of the sport, who has set a few world records and is so good that Mark Spitz (a world famous Australian Olympic swimmer, and multiple world record holder) has been quoted as saying that this kid could break his record of 7 Gold Medals. He didn't even show his "A" game in the 200m freestyle, and whooped up on the competition.  Natalie Coughlin, who was widely regarded as an "up-and-comer" in 2000 (but then suffered a devastating shoulder injury), started her comeback a few years ago, and she is ON. She's the ONLY American woman to ever complete the 100m backstroke in under 1:00. (If you don't know swimming, that is GREAT.) Well, she didn't get a great start off the block, but she did it AGAIN. 0:59.85. Oh. My. God. AND she's a massive hottie. Where do I go to meet her?

I had to finish the intro. ;)  Anyway, I've been trying out a bunch of free blogging sites lately, in an attempt to find a good, quality (and free) blogging company. I'm a little broke right now, so I can't afford to pay for the monthly hosting fees.  Let's see how this goes, and I hope I'll see you back for more.

      Oh yeah, this class looks like it'll be fun.  This is a Political Science course on Voting, Campaigning and Elections. First, this can be fun because of the timing - I'm taking this just before the 2004 Presidential and Congressional elections. Second, the teacher is pretty cool and funny. Professor Galderisi is a Jewish Democrat from New York; he loves to make fun of the Democrats, and relates a lot of the course lessons to what has happened in previous elections.  Oh yeah, there are a few hotties in class, too. :)
