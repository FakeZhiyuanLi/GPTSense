       Okay, well, who ever this is reading this, hello. How are ya these days? Okay, well uh, everyone has their own view of life. Some people believe that we live, we die, boo-hoo cry my a river, build me a bridge, and get over it cuz I don't care about your problems. Some believe that God is our savior and will guide the way to happiness. And then there are those who just say "I'm alive" period. Nothing more, nothing less. Just a simple answer that expresses a million feelings of confusion into two words. What's the purpose in life? Is there a reason for everything, or is that just all in our heads? Is God supposed to be what guides us, or are we really all on our own just trying to get by? Do I  deserve  the bad in my life? Is there someone meant for me our there somewhere, or is that just something a lonely bastard said one night and the whole world uses it as an excuse? That's me. The confused. The messed up one. The one who comes to a fork in the road and asks everyone for directions and  still  can't find the right path. It's hard being this confused. You don't know what to do about anything, and it ends up causing more problems later on. To be quite honest, sometimes it's good to have an open mind about things. Instead of always having to choose the same path, you can switch around and experiment a little. But a lot of my friends aren't like that, not that I'm dissing them in any way, it's just harder on me. Sometimes I just need to handle things by sitting right at the fork in the road with a map on my legs and watch the cars pass me by. Especially with the religion topic. Some of my friends believe that God is what lights the way to a happy life. That's fine that they think that way and connect with Him that way, but I'm not like that. I believe that he loves us, but I don't think I can put my whole heart and soul into something that has never helped me in the past. I tried that road and it was way too bumpy of a ride for me.. And sometimes I feel like they don't accept it. It may just be all in my head, but that's what I seem to be feeling. There are so many issues like that, and it's hard to work through sometimes, cuz I'm very dependent on my friends, but I like to do my own thing sometimes. I don't know. But what I do know is that no matter what it is that you think when someone asks you about your view of the world is what makes you you. I hide in the corner watching the world go by..What do you do?

        Hello world.. well i have to say, things are finally looking brighter these days..       For starters, i had the most awesome week at the fair (even though it's hicksville USA). On the first night of the fair, I woke up really early and went with Mel. We eventually hung out with Rob and Aaron and we went and saw Nick's band play and eventually Flood as well. Then at the end of the night, Mel pushed me n Rob together and now we're dating..      Then throughout the rest of the fair, Mel and I went there every morning except for friday the 13th lol. We had a blast chilling with Beano, playing truth or dare on Chris's phone (which was sooo badly x rated), calling Rob, Aaron, and Beano fatasses right infront of Chris, the tampon conversation.. oh so many good times..   The there were the times with Rob, but there's no need to get into the mushy stuff.. let's just say he was adorable and i'm happy to be with him..      So now that I am with the sweetest guy i've ever met, friends with someone i haven't talked to in a while, got closer with other friends and people i didn't think i liked much, i am in pretty good shape for a change. i pray to God every once in a while, which is a lot more than i used to, so i'm getting better with that, my self esteam isn't as bad anymore, and everything just seems so much better now.      Although everything seems ok, i still have my problems..i think there are just always problems no matter how good things are, but right now, i couldnt care less about problems. It's like there's no reason to care what's coming at me cuz right now i'm loved by 3 very important people, and that's all that matters..Mel, Aaron, and Rob.      Dance and school will be starting up soon, and everything will be as it should be. Lunch will be a blast, and i'm looking forward to school as sad as it is. As much as I'm gonna miss the summer, I miss the fun times at lunch and being surrounded by the same group of friends all the time instead of once in a while when we all happen to have the time in our busy summer schedules. oh well..only a few more weeks..

       i was happy once..when i sit and look out the window, i remember all of the times when i smiled without a care in the world..before the dramas of being a teenager..all of the memories of the days when i was happy bring me to tears, because i know that i am not that little girl anymore..       the little girl who loved her daddy and would play baseball, football, and soccer with him in the backyard all the time and a game of cards when it was too gloomy to go outside, or the girl who always wanted a little brother or sister, who sat in the large patch of four-leaf clovers and talked to God about her problems, or would lay in the snow and feel the world turning while watching the clouds fly by, or always looked at the sunny days and thought they were beautiful and never really liked a cloudy day, or enjoyed school and didn't really mind the other kids there, who never knew how parents really acted like when they were in another room, and who looked in the mirror and smiled because she liked being the person she was..       thats not me anymore..she's been gone for a long time now..that little girl grew up and saw what the world was really like..that her daddy was an asshole and can never find a nice thing to say about her, and that siblings can be quite anoiying, who came to the conclusion that God was never really listening to the girl by the four-leaf clovers, and she lost touch with the world to the point that she didnt feel the earth moving while laying in the snow, and now those sunny days are the worst and the gloomy days are what she can relate to best, she came to hate people and school because she lived in an atmosphere with so many fights that it was all she came to know and expect from people..and now she has the mirror covered so she wouldnt have to see the person looking back at her and remember who she really is and what she really looks like..       its hard to stay possitive and move on with your life when you still cant get ovet the fact that you were that little girl and your not anymore and you cant ever get her back..although i'm trying to change some of the things that tear me down in life, i'm broken and i can never be fully repaired..because i was happy once.. i was happy once..

       for a while, i've always stayed pulled over on the side of the road because i had no idea which dirrection i was suppose to in. i had been trying to get directions, but any route that i found wasnt good for me. roads i had tried in the past had been too hard for me and i never wanted to try that ever again..       well i realized that even though it's sometimes nice to not have a set path, sometimes you need one. you want options, but you want an idea on what is going on in life. to make some choices that you can regret or be proud of. i think that i've been afraid to regret. sometimes you need to make a wrong choice, or at least risk making a wrong choice. or maybe trying to look at another persons point of veiw and see the person that you are because of the things that you've done.       it finally hit me that i need to change a little. i mean, i think i knew it all along, but i didnt wanna know it. just like i knew that sooner or later, i would have to run to God for help, but i didnt wanna know that. i just brushed past it and acted as though i didnt need it in my life, but the truth is, i do. i dont like the person i've become. i'm too self centered and i dont think about other people. its good when i dont care what people think i look like, but i should care about other people's problems and concerns. that i havent been doing. in all honesty, i know i have not been a good friend to anybody. i'm never there for them through thick and thin because all of the bad times are caused by me, which defeats the purpose of being a friend. and a lot of people seem so happy.. and all of them are close with God. so, i think that thats another road that i'm going to try. it doesnt mean that i may not turn back and decide to go a different way, but for now, thats where i'm headed. God. but thats enough about all that jazz.       theres one more thing that makes life a complicated thing..the heart. plain and simple. theres someone who used to always be there for me. picked me up when i needed it. unfortunately, i havent been able to talk to this person in quite a while. and now i dont know what to do. should i hang on and see what happens? let go so i dont get hurt? its a hard choice. i dont wanna hang onto something that i wont be able to have in the future.. cuz then it'll be really weird having to see him everyday and know that we wont ever be anything more than friends, and i had gotten my heart set on the   two of us being together some day.. i guess you can't live a fairytale..
