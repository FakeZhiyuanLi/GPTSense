        Living in this moment can be torture. The gloomy haze of the unknown seems like it will cover me forever. When will the sun shine through- shedding light on the truth? The truth that is so evident to those who stand and watch.           The easy road is the one that stays in the fog for eternity, never risking, and in the end never knowing. I am here to hold the hand of the one who wants to experience all of life. See what happiness life can bring. The initial plunge is daunting, but once it is taken the rest becomes clear. There may not be a guide book to show the exact path to take. But, that is the exciting part. That is what life is all about. Navigating with someone; following the directions of the heart. The answer is always there...whether we decide to see it is solely up to us.               One could go a lifetime living unhappily, but comfortable, in that haze because the challenge of grabbing what one wants is too hard. But, the easy road is less fulfilling. It leaves you with regrets and what-ifs. I don't want to live that life. It is lonely and desperate, two things I refuse to be. So why does the jump seem so far when the pillow that catches you is so close, so real? Everything that you want is only achieved by going and getting it.               The hard road produces the sweetest reward. And, as the age old saying goes, "the best things in life are worth waiting for." So, for now, that is what I do. I wait. But, I can't wait in this haze forever. I crave the light and the truth that comes with it. Right now there is the chance - no, acutually the choice - to create something amazing. To share the sweetest thing that life has to offer. But, can you do it? Can you make yourself happy? Do you know how much you deserve to be happy? How worthy you are of having the best the world has to offer? Can you grab happiness while it is dangled in your beautiful face, or are you going to let it slip from the fumbling grasp you have on it?              The twisted road we walk down leaves me wondering if every step is my last. The fork in the road could leave me standing by myself. Left to make sense of the un-just pain bestowed upon me. Meanwhile you wander down the opposite path- content in the fog of complacency.

        After much procrastination, I finally got around to putting together this blog. I am really excited to get started. Bear with me as I tweak things until I get it all just right!
