      in ym last writing i saw that i used way too many " i guesses". yea i know, the end of the world right? you know what that's the problem with ppl today. we need to loosen up. everyone's so damn anal about what's going on in the world or whats going on in other people's lives, ( this whole gay marriage thing) when our own shit is fucked up. we're living in messed up times ladies and gents. i mean no one can be themselves without being put into a 'certain' class of people. then those people are put into a sub category and then that sub category is put into an even smaller category, until we're nothing at all. so then what is life, then? NOTHING. there's no such thing as black, white, gay, straight or anything of the such, were nothing at all.                                            ZEN eat your heart out.. HEH HEH

            i have no idea why i am doing this, i guess its because you're going outta town so i guess i will use this as a means to keep you updated on the random goings on in my life, seeing as how nothing has happened to me right now, i guess i have nothing more to write. well i guess as a bonus, you, my public get the view it too.heh heh

           Even though its the end of the year my work is just beginning. of course, there are numerous topics on my mind  i do wish to expound upon in this little do-hickey. so i guess i'll start eh?   well first i would like to talk about this whole blog phenomenon. a smart person once told me that people just use these things as an excuse to make them always seem right and the rest of the world just a horrible, soul sucking vampire. but what i dont unuderstand is why can these assholes who do write these 'blogs', why cant you guys just write about both sides of the story? i mean whats wrong with being wrong every once in awhile?   i mean everytime you read these things usually they are about: " oh god my world is tortured" or " oh god, everyone hates me",or "pain". how original is that? i mean these people who write these things are always going through some sort of "pain". i mean these assholes act as if they are the only one's who feel pain, hurt, sadness, madness,frustartion, anger, etc. i mean hell on the flip side you probally are telling the truth... maybe everyone doesnt like you. i mean who would like a snivelling little shit who sits in their mother's basements and write crappy poetry, make stupid drawings, or write ( and lie) in these blogs about why people dont like them.  what i dont understand is that you bitch and moan about people not liking you and then the same "rebel" will go back and tell the world about how much of a bad ass they are and how they dont need people, or they will write about how civilization is so damn stupid, and you wonder why you dont have any friends?  i mean for christ sakes! get your ass up, get out your mom's basement ( cus im sure she's sick of you), and go make friends,smoke a cig, drink some beer, have pre-marital sex. JESUS DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LIFE EXCEPT FOR BITCH AND MOAN ABOUT WHY YOU HAVE NO FRIENDS. HERE MY PHILOSOPHY: THE MORE BITCHING YOU DO, THE LONLIER YOU WILL GET!  i mean you guys are the same people who go around and wear clothes  with chains on them, your mom's or sister's make-up ( cus your not manly enough to go out and buy your own), you read books on witch craft, practice spells, belive in that zodiac bullshit,and use a leaf and a rabbit's foot so "true love" will land in a hole in your back yard!   let me tell you something, asshole: you are not an individual. people have been doing what your doing for years, thousands are.so what makes you so individualistic? i mean you had to get the idea for doing all these things ( the hair, make-up, books, clothes, etc) from someone else, right? i mean the real individual is the kid who popped out of their mom's crotch wearing the make up, the clothes, and the 'tude'. i mean belive it or not... marilyn and ozzie didnt dress like that their entire life. ITS FAKE!! just like the rappers.ITS ALL FAKE!!! let it go!  you want a true individual? the kid who wear his shirts, his jeans, and his jeans. not to make a staple, not to be out there... no they do it, because, it just wouldnt look right to walk around in the nude would it? i mean the true individual is the kid who doesnt care about what other people are doing and mind's their own business. i mean what ever happend to developing relationships? going out? eating junk-food with your friends and playing video games? i'm sorry but me personally that's what i'm about. BTW it would be easy for you to say, " well arent you one of us?" simply, no i'm not. unlike you people who live on the net, i do this in my spare time, just for fun.   think about it.  THERE IS A WORLD OUTSIDE... EXPLORE IT, IT'LL DO YA SOME GOOD...heheheh

      for my last blog im sorry i take it back. okay but you know when your in one of those really uncomfortable situations that you have no idea why you put yourself through. of course, seeing as how this is the last resort for any sort of kind familiar human contact. aint it just sad folks? im mean im sitting here in a room with two people who i personally know dont like me and i just keep on coming over here. well my trips over here arent very frequent but i come over here and sit in this murk nonetheless. heh. the things you do for yourself right?? for your friends??? of course, i have no fucking idea weither they are my friends or not. personally i think that at any second one of them will hit me in the head with a sledge hammer. what do you think america? am i paranoid? or am i just the most right person you'd ever meet. then they wonder why when one of them handles some sort of sharp object i flinch.... psychos............  hurdy gur--------------

           im sitting down here in a room that i thought i would never have to see again. the ragin' computer lab. woo hoo.  " let me get a second just to reinvent myself."  these past few days have been nothing short of catastrophic for me. lets see i've:  damn near lost my relationship got into a bitch fight with my mom am right now currently suffering a feeling of which i cant even name damn near lost my relationship  yea i know, to you, my adrious reader, that really doesnt seem like a lot but thats only my way of putting eight smiles on it and making alot of shit all compiled into a few catergories.  well my usual way of dealing with these things was to just leave the house and just escape from it all. but coming back here being in this damn place i am more than reminded of that morid evening. i am reminded about why i'm a bad person, i'm reminded about how most of my friends are gunning for what i have. i reminded of no matter what i do, what i say, or what actions i take, this is just a losing battle. no, not with the peron im involved with, no, we're fine. cept for the fact that i get increasingly madder and madder when he keeps trying to hang out with one of the people whom i thought was my friend, who openly admitted that they would, in fact make moves on my spouse. as a matter of fact, let me get on that.  im dealing with a person here who has stated over and over again in the past that they would in fact do "things" ( lets keep this PG) with my spouse if given the chance. of course my spuse doesnt make the situation any better because they keep trying over nd over and over again to be involved with this person.  they justify it with saying, " only when your not around." of course i cant say anything to that. but, i just find it funny that its only when i'm not around that shit like this just seems to come up. also find it funny that over that last few weeks when my spouse wasnt around, when i asked you if i could come over you had one excuse after another, every fucking day. i hate that fact that my spouse tells me over and over again about how they dont like him, but they will jump on the chance to be around him at any giving moment. constantly waving movie offers and chance encounters in my face. just because i show no emotion doesnt mean it doesnt bother me. what i really do find funny, and again its only one of those things that happens when i am not around is that fact that, YOU just happen to invite my spouse over, claiming mommy wasnt going to be home, claiming that she worked evenings now. i find it funny that you told me she worked mornings and she's home during the day   thats why you couldnt have people over. and now, when my spouse is back in town she just so happened to have a schedule change.  i guess life is just funny.   ill end this with this note here... i've played around with this in the past, but i never meant it, but here, for the first time for all your viewing pleasure... i do.  Michael Tremain Brewer and Terrell Kenneth Lacey... I wish DEATH upon. I SWEAR TO GOD I HOPE YOU DIE!!!!
