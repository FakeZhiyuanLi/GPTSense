      I got an early phone call from a good friend and we talked about relationships and stuff, and how things could changed in just seconds, which made me wonder about life..my life. Sometimes, life can be so perfect, when everything seems to be just right and you feel like you can't ask for more because you already have what you want. We are blinded by happiness without thinking about what's gonna happen next. When we fail or when something bad happens, we start blaming ourselves for no reasons. We feel like we're stucked in one position and we can't move on. Or maybe it's us who don't want to move on? That's probably because we're not ready. And I don't think we'll ever be ready for everything.    Sometimes you just have to accept for what you get in life, either it's good or bad. We should just enjoy the good and learn from the bad. Should people be afraid to hope or to reach for something? I don't know, I feel like I don't really want to give too much hope anymore. We live in this world to gamble and from what I've been through, I think there's no need to be afraid. But before we make efforts, we should probably be prepared about what the result's gonna be like. Again, it's easier said than done. But, hey..it's worth a try.

      Can lovers stay friends after going through a painful break up? I don't know the answer to that. Some people say yes, but some people say no. Well..it's easier said than done.   When two people with different characters are in a relationship, they are trying to learn about each other to make their relationship works. They become bestfriends and even like a family. You feel comfortable when you're together and feel like you're missing your other half when he's not around. You don't have to worry about what he thinks about what you're gonna wear or even your most embarrasing behaviors, because you know that you are loved very much. Just to hear his voice from the other end of a phone call is like a pain reliever after a long day at work. Just to receive a short text message on your cellphone from him has made your day. Just to see your instant messenger blinking with his name on it can make you happy, because you know that he's thinking about you.   However, shits happen here and there. You can never predict them. The thought of loosing my very bestfriend and soulmate..has never occurred to me since the past three years. You can lie to everybody about your feelings and pretend like nothing happen, but deep inside you know, you're hurting.   My friend once said that people need to be strong in this situation because the pain is not over yet. It will keep coming back and haunt you on every little step that you make, every minute, every day. Again, it's easier said than done. But I guess he has a point there. There's nothing much to do, except to believe that it all happened for a reason. You learn from the situation, which can make you a better person everyday.   When the worst it's over, I know that things will go back to normal. Although it would not be as perfect as it was before.

      Did you guys see that  urlLink nip/tuck   show on FX earlier? I thought it was so disturbing, but I kept watching it anyway..hehe. Plus Julian McMahon (Dr. Christian Troy) is so gorgeous!! I think this show is different from the other plastic surgery shows such as the one from MTV or the Swan, because they add more "drama" in the story, which makes it more interesting. Can't wait to see more of it next week.  Today I had a training for my second job, and it started at 9am until 4pm. It was so tiring! We had to walk around campus and went to advocacy offices to get information and learn about their programs. We also had to do a lot of activities like scavenger hunt and a bunch of games. And "luckily", it was pretty nice outside. It was really..really hot and sunny. Oh well, let's just hope it stays.  Tired..tired..tired..tomorrow I have to get up early again to work and do a lot of other things.. sigh . Nite, all!

      Welcome to Colorado..It is the second day of Summer, but it doesn't feel like summer at all!! The weather has been really gloomy for the past couple of weeks. It's always raining and the sun only comes out once in a while. Today in Fort Collins is 55F and it will drop tonight to 45F. The weather here is very "unusual", because sometimes the weather can be really nice and sunny, but it can change very dramatically at night. Or it can be snowing the next day. I remember last year we had a very big storm after Spring break, so we actually got a two-week break from school!! That was nice, but I didn't like "the walking in the snow" part. It's slippery and wet. No thanks!  Anyways, I just got home from work and feel like writing something on my blog. I've been working for 8-12 hours a day for almost everyday. I've been really busy. But, hey..I kinda need the money anyway, so that's alright. I have two jobs this summer, one in the dining service and one in the housing service on campus. I work in a dining hall for the students who live in a dorm. Basically what I do is just serving food or swiping their meal cards. It's not really bad. My second job is pretty easy and fun. I work for this organization called  urlLink CREATE  . My job is to create bulletin boards, posters, and display cases with different themes every month. They will be put inside the campus' dorms and apartments. We also organize and create events, which I always enjoy doing. I guess thanks to "redlight".   I didn't take any classes this summer, so I can work a lot. But still..I have to finish my research proposal for my thesis. It's almost done, but I'm still too lazy to finish it. I decided to do a research on "The Ethical Issues of Downloading Music via the Internet." Do I download music? Yes..hehe, why do we have to buy music CDs if they are available on the Net? I guess I shouldn't be saying that.   By the way, yesterday was father's day, so  "Happy Father's Day"  to all dads!! I don't know why we don't have father's day in Indonesia. We have hari ibu on December 22 and hari anak-anak on July 1, but we never celebrate hari bapak. Why is that? Don't you think that your dad needs appreciation too? That is so weird. I want to get my dad something. I already know what he probably wants, but don't know when I can give it to him, because I don't really want to send the gift by mail. First, it's too expensive. Second, I don't want to lose it in the mail.   Anyway, I found this really sweet quote on the Net:   a father is someone that  holds your hand at the fair makes sure you do what your mother says holds back your hair when you are sick brushes that hair when it is tangled because mother is too busy lets you eat ice cream for breakfeast  but only when mother is away he walks you down the aisle and tells you everythings gonna be ok   -Unknown      Enjoy your night, everyone!!

      Yay!! We're going to see fireworks at City Park, tonight. I hope it's not gonna rain again tonight, because it's kinda cloudy right now. But it's alright, it will be fun..fun..fun!! Finally, today's my first day off after working like crazy for the past two weeks. This morning I got a chance to have a cup of Starbucks' breakfast blend coffee with two slices of bread with chocolate sprinkles. Yumm!! And finally, I got a chance to go to sleep last night without having to set my alarm. I spent my morning by just sitting around in front of my computer, browsing, waiting for my bid at ebay to end, and chatting with  urlLink Mur  who's still having fun in Jakarta!! I "envy" you!! I also talked to A-lie, one of my bestfriends since forever, on the phone today. It felt good to talk to her again. Actually, we laughed more than we talked!! I think the only people who can understand our jokes are us. We often lost touch, but we're still very good friends!! We talked about lots of things and came up with why people always ask sensitive questions to others such as virginity and sex. Those are like  "pertanyaan-pertanyaan yang kurang penting untuk dibahas ke orang lain."  Those are like something that..I think we should just keep to ourselves. Like in Friendster for example, lots of those bulletin boards questions are about these subjects. And of course, no one will really be honest about their answers. It's just dumb!   Anyway, I'm thinking of moving to DC, which is where she lives right now, after I graduate, to apply for that broadcasting job that we're talking about. It sounds like a fun job, and it will be a great experience for me if I want to get a similar job back home. We'll see. I still have a year to go anyway.    My weekend? So far so good. Me and some friends went to see Spiderman 2  on Friday. It was good!! I like it better than the first one. Yesterday, I had to wake up early at 6 A.M. to work (yes..I work on weekends) and spent my afternoon with friends. We went to Whole Foods Market, a new organic store in town. It was really crowded inside the store and everything was so expensive!! After that, we had some Japanese food in downtown for dinner. As usual, me and Puma ended up at my place, watching the Food network channel. It was an okay night.  How's your weekend?

      Just a little update from me. Nothing much going on lately. Still, I've been busy with work and stuff. Weekend doesn't feel like weekend anymore. I kind of miss the old times when I was still in Jakarta. Weekend seemed really fun. On Friday night I usually go out with friends.. kadang2 mencoba tempat2 baru..hehe . I remember when I was in high school, if we didn't have school on Saturday, we always went to new york cafe to watch the Groove on stage..hehe..they always knew our crowd, because we're all girls..hehe. On Saturday night we usually  "nonton midnite."  And on Sunday, I usually go out for lunch or just to "socially drink" coffee at the mall with my parents..hehe. Gosh, I miss home so much.  Last weekend (Fri-Sat) I had to go for a one night retreat. It was alright. I had fun, until I discovered that my room was full of bugs!! We finally moved to another room (which was nicer than the first one hehe), because we decided to not sleep with bugs flying around the room. What we did on the retreat was pretty much team building and playing games. The highlight of the retreat was when we got to do the drumming for diversity training. It was awesome..we could choose any kinds of instruments from drum to tambourine, and we just started playing them for more than two hours. We could all feel the energy that came out from the instruments. It was fun! The next day we all just felt exhausted and ready to go home. We stopped at dairy queen for ice cream on the way home..yumm!!   Hmm..what else..I got home two hours ago from eating out with puma and went to Walmart to buy some stuff. I didn't really wanna go at first because it's "Nip/Tuck Show" day..hehe..but I went anyway and got home on time to watch the second show.   Hmm..I guess that's pretty much it. Tomorrow is another new day at work. How's your day people?

      The weather sucks. It's cold and cloudy in July.&nbsp;Today is around 57 F and&nbsp;I think it's gonna rain again tonight. Oh well!! I just got home from work. I was sent home early because they have too many people. I asked my manager if I could go home and he said the big YES. Yay!&nbsp;But..I have nothing to do now. Maybe I'll just take a nap later :P     Anyways, yesterday me and my friends went to see Bourne Supremacy. (Did you see Bourne Identity? Well, this is the sequel). We went there around 6 p.m. to catch the 7:15 show. We knew that there's gonna be a long line, because it's the first day it came out. When we got there..it was sold out!! Even the 7:45 show. Gosh, I thought we were early. We should had used  urlLink Fandango . Then, we decided to go to&nbsp;another theatre, because we really wanted to see the movie. And..yay..We got the tickets. After the movie, we went to chili's for dinner. I ordered a cup of my favorite soup there, enchiladas soup, and buffalo wings with bleu cheese. Hmm..Yummy!!   It was a great night and an A+ movie. Matt Damon is so gorgeous in his black long coat. I think I like&nbsp;this movie&nbsp;better than the first one, although I don't really remember the first one..hihihi. Can't wait to see the third one! I heard that there's gonna be the sequel to  I, Robot  too .  Hmm..that will be interesting to see.   It's saturday afternoon..I'm not sure what to do tonight. All my friends are still at work. Tomorrow I have to get up really early again to work for 12 hours from 6:50 a.m. Isn't that great??   How's your weekend so far?

       I just got back from work and it's raining..again. It's been like this since this afternoon. I got a split shift at work today, so I got a chance to take a nap..hihihi. Anyways, my week has been going well. I pretty much work during the day and just hang out or eat out with friends. Here in Fort Collins, we have a lot of restaurants, but there aren't that many variety of food. Maybe I'm just bored with all the food. But one restaurant that keeps going up in my favorite list is Jeju. It's a Japanese-Korean restaurant, located in downtown of Fort Collins. They have a really good food there, from sushi to tempura to Korean barbecue. Hmm...Yummy. The atmosphere is also really nice. It's more like a loungelike with a nice light setting, where you can here Jazz and blues music. It's not like an Asian restaurant at all. Here in Fort Collins, we also have a lot of local owner coffee shops. I've only been to one of them, and it was..alright. Still, Starbucks is way much better.&nbsp;Many people here, well..maybe in the other states too, they're not really a fan of Starbucks and its monopoly power.&nbsp;What's with that anyway?&nbsp;So what,&nbsp;they have a good coffee, and they're making a lot of money from it.&nbsp;I found this Web Site about  urlLink Why do I hate Starbucks?  This guy..or gal came up with numbers of reason why he or she hates Starbucks:    The majority of the coffee is grown using underpaid third world labor.   Starbucks is spreading the world like a virus, infecting cultures with their formula of what a coffee shop should be.   They are everywhere.   They have predatory business practices. Doing things like paying landlords to not renew leases for coffee shops so that they can move in.   They sell fake corporate responsibility.   I think that their coffee sucks. It is always bitter.   The gross profit margin per store is, on average, 59.1%, this is money that could easily be lost if they paid more than a dollar a pound for coffee. (read: livable wage for their slave labor)   Faux ecologic responsibility.    What do you think? Maybe some of them make sense, but I still love drinking their coffee anyway. And...they say that you will feel the Starbucks experience when you drink their coffee. I agree..whatever that means!    &nbsp;Anyway, me and my friends had been wanting to see I, Robot. So, yesterday, after I got home from working long hours,&nbsp;the four of us&nbsp;went to see I, Robot. It was awesome, I like it a lot. It will be scarry though, if that's how 2035 is gonna be like..hehe, but maybe it will be really cool to have a robot at home.   There are lots of good movies at the theatre that I haven't seen. And more good movies are "coming soon" hihihi..Bourne Supremacy and Collateral are on the top of my list. The village? I don't know,&nbsp;I get scared easily&nbsp;by watching that kind of movie.&nbsp;I also haven't seen Fahrenheit 9/11, The Terminal, and The Notebook. Isn't that sad..hiks.   By the way, I got a call from Neeru this afternoon. He's been having fun for the past two months in Jakarta now!! I'm so jealous. But I will see my parents too in about two weeks though. Yup..they're coming here. Well, I'm planning to meet them in Las Vegas. I made a lot of plans, and I just found out yesterday that I have to be in a two weeks full of training when they're here. It's kinda sad, but I'll see what I can do with the schedule.  Well, that's all for now. Have a great night you guys!

      Quotes from You've Got Mail:   urlLink  Frank   : What about you, is there someone else?    urlLink  Kathleen Kelly   : No. No, but, but there's the dream of someone else.      You've Got Mail is one of my favorite movies of all time. I've watched it more than 20 times or more. I really like to watch the chemistry between Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks. They look so cute together. The reason why I put the quote above is because I feel like I'm in the same situation with Kathleen. My friends have been asking me the same question over and over again, and my answer is still the same. NO. But the quote above is my real answer. I've been having this dream for years, even when I was still with my ex. Isn't that funny? What if..this dream keeps haunting when I end up with someone else? What if..this dream is supposed to come true? Although, I don't even know how to make it happens.  The question that keeps coming up is,  "should I wait..or should I not?"

      I can't believe that Summer is almost over. I have only 18 days left before school starts and I haven't done anything exciting this Summer. That sounds really sad isn't it..hihihi. Anyway, I really need to get out from this town. That's why, I'm planning to go to New York to meet up with my three best friends in a couple of weeks!! Yay..that's exciting. I haven't seen them in a while. Although it's only gonna be a weekend get away, I'm still really excited!!!  Today, I had a picnic with some friends from work. Actually, It was supposed to be a meeting, but we decided to do it differently. We went to City Park at noon and had lunch there. Each of us brought some dishes or drinks. It was like a little pot-luck party. The meeting only took about 10 minutes, then we decided to play Bocce Ball, one of my favorite sports hihihihi. It is really easy and I'm not sure that it can be considered as a sport, because I'm really bad at sports hehehe.  I got home at around 2 and spent my afternoon watching dvd and taking a nap :P I've been watching some movies these couple of days.            I watched : stuck on you, monster, butterfly effect, 50 first date, along came polly, and the human stain . I didn't get to see them when they're playing at the theatre, so I just rented them.  Butterfly effect ? That's the movie with Ashton Kutcher in it. I, honestly, didn't really get the connection between the Chaos theory and the butterfly effect. Well, maybe it's just me. This movie is.."interesting"..it's just like one of those Twilight Zone movies, but I prefer to watch twilight zone instead of this movie. So, don't waste your money to watch it hehehe. The other movies were alright, except for  The Human Stain , I slept during the movie and watched it over when I woke up :P It's a little bit boring.  I've been really enjoying my days lately. Although I have to work almost everyday, I still have some time to relax and have some fun. Sometimes just to sit at home, watch tv, and do nothing can be relaxing. Don't you think?
