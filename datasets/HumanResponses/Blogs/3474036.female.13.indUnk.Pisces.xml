      it's a quite funny thing, you know. life and the rules. everyone hates talking about it and all that physcological stuff, i know...i do too. but it's so interesting.  they don't know me. they don't know how i'll play my cards. they think i am weak; cripple...like them. no, i am not like them. i am another.   but what does it matter?
