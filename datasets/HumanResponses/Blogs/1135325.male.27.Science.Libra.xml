      Ever since I switched recently and for a little while before that too I have been following news about Apple. There is an interesting article on Robert X. Cringley's "I, Cringley" page about the future of Apple following the creation of a separate iPod division. Mr. Cringley evaluates it in relation to a 20 year old quote from Steve Jobs. Interesting items include  "What most people don’t know is that Apple, with the assistance of Intel, a few years ago ported all its software to run on Intel’s Pentium processors."   urlLink Divide and Conquer: Why Apple Has an iPod Division

      Just like pursuing any academic goal, pursuing a PhD has its own set of requirements. One of these is the actual writing of the thesis, which I hope to do someday. Maybe then this HOWTO will help.  urlLink How-To: Write your doctoral thesis || kuro5hin.org  Also, check out Jorge Cham's  urlLink www.phdcomics.com

      Today, Sony released the PSP and Nintendo released the DS at E 3 . I think the PSP looks much cooler than the DS and would love to get my hands on it. Dunno if or when that will happen but it would be cool.  urlLink E3: Sony PSP High Resolution Shots and Final Specs   urlLink E3: Nintendo DS High Res Shot

      This post marks the beginning of a blog that I hope to update regularly. Of course, if I don't, then I will delete this blog after some time and this post will never have existed. Well, it may be archived on some server somewhere on the web, but then that is inevitable.

      Just noticed  urlLink this entry  on WorldChanging about the  urlLink Digital Library of India .

As a first step in realizing this mission, it is proposed to create the Digital Library with a free-to-read, searchable collection of one million books, predominantly in Indian languages, available to everyone over the Internet ".

      The most awesome thing happened today and it's all over the place. SpaceShipOne successfully landed after a brief visit to space. Congratulations to the Scaled Composites people!

      I like animation. Sometime ago I came across the  urlLink XIAOXIAO MOVIE  website. It features many stick figure animations involving kung-fu. They are awesome. Today there is  urlLink a post on BoingBoing  involving stick figures. Oh, and also see  urlLink this  stick figure recreation of  the Weapon of Choice video by Fatboy Slim. Enjoy!

      According to  urlLink this post :  - Technorati is tracking 3 million blogs, including this one.  - A new blog is created every 5.8 seconds.  - 275,000 individual posts everyday. This is one of them.  - People are moving away from the TV to the computer. I know, I am.  I think this is probably going to continue well into the next year. Even more if Yahoo! and MSN provide blogging services and Google integrates its services.

      Last weekend I started reading about the imminent arrival of Cassini at Saturn. I'm the casual space enthusiast who doesn't go to space.com everyday but gets quite excited when something is happening up/out there. Even more when the event is influenced by humans. Last night Cassini made it and is now in orbit around the planet. Woohoo! Congratulations to everyone involved.  urlLink Saturn Orbit Insertion | Metafilter
