        Yesterday was a very nice exciting day.&nbsp; Driver's Ed in the morning (but I only have 4 more classes left ) where we talked about the physics of car crashes which was lovely.&nbsp; Heathyr Lee came over right afterward and we helped with the Munchkin swim team, looked at the rocks and saw what they reminded us of (fromage, the Grand Tetons which means "large gentle breasts" according to my dad, a tiger with a cavity, etc.), swinged (?) on the swings, this time without them breaking, did some syncronized swimming- it was a lot of fun.&nbsp; Came back to the house and the boys were playing "hide and go seek" again.&nbsp; The other day, it was the scariest thing in the whole world because I went to use the bathroom and one of Jimmy's friends was hiding in the shower.&nbsp; So now before I want to go to the bathroom, I have to do a ten minute check- in the tub, laundry hamper, towel bin, under the sink... a&nbsp;lot of safety precautions&nbsp;just to go pee.&nbsp; Anyway then we played Sorry (Heathyr won... barely) and Life (I won) and it was time for Heathyr to go.&nbsp; Then I went and got my haircut and it looked amazing because she straightened it and everything-&nbsp;I took some pictures because its only once every 3 months that it looks like that.&nbsp; Unfortunately.&nbsp; She said chemically straightening my hair is an option but I'd have to fork over $375.&nbsp; EEIIICKK!&nbsp; So I'm debating that- tell me what you think.&nbsp; Then I went to Awards Night for FFC and I found out my relay team broke the record for the 200 Medley Relay for the FVSSL league- 1.58.46 so my name's going down in the record books for at least a year.&nbsp; That's pretty exciting- I didn't even find out until then.&nbsp; Lots of good food- Garland made her famous mac and cheese and there were some amazing cupcakes...&nbsp; Well its time to practice driving.&nbsp; Hasta Luego!

       I haven't updated this in so long so I decided to write something a little more recent.&nbsp; Now I just have to think of something to write in the 15 minutes before lifeguarding.&nbsp; Only 5 more driver's ed classes which is very exciting- I'm two thirds the way done.&nbsp; The driving practice has been going better- I've been on Route 6 and driving on real roads with other cars multiple times.&nbsp; And I've almost run over mailboxes, trash cans but no alive things lately so that's nice.&nbsp; I had swim team championships on tuesday.&nbsp; I swam pretty good and James the sxxist man in the whole world cheered for me and... get this!!&nbsp; He massaged my&nbsp;SHOULDERS this time... even better than the thumb massage.&nbsp; *dreamy sigh James, James, James the nummiest swim coach ever.&nbsp; Except for Geoff but I'm temporarily mad at him because he's too fast and too cute.&nbsp; I guess he got a freaking 1.36 on his 100 free in a relay once and his 200 IM (best event) he gets a 1.44.&nbsp; I don't think any of you know how fast that is.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's well... FAST!&nbsp; Anyway, so&nbsp;swim team's&nbsp;all over and munchkin swim&nbsp;team will e over after thier meet tomarrow.&nbsp; (They're are all excited because they get medals.... so cute!) I got my first pay check- $140.38 which is VERY exciting but I've been to the mall so many times its all pretty much gone.&nbsp; And lifeguarding's been good- no one has drowned under my watch so far.&nbsp; And it keeps raining so my hours are shortened with is a lot of fun except when my hours are cut in half (and I don't have that many in the first place).&nbsp; I am not very good at writing today because I keep thinking of James...

        My inspiration for summer "swim team", the apple of my eye, the mango of my heart has descended from Long Beach California and has returned to dreary Farmington.&nbsp; With a high seas tan, a sprinkling of freckles and tales of warming up next to Micheal Phelps :O, this yummy swim coach has streamlined his way back to my heart!! And in the process, I have regained some of my ability to swim.&nbsp; (Last week I was tired and lazy and I was having some difficulties... BUT NOT ANYMORE!)&nbsp; I'm going to a staff dinner with him tonight (this whole lifeguarding where I'm a member is so wierd.&nbsp; All&nbsp;my fellow lifeguards&nbsp;have to&nbsp;treat me like a little&nbsp;kids in swim team and around the pool&nbsp;during the day, then at night I work with them and we are all friendly and stuff.&nbsp; As I said previously- v. awkward.)&nbsp; Actually I have tons to do, but I had to harold the return of the Glorious Geoff and two more things.&nbsp; I got a 4 on my AP chemistry exam- YAY!&nbsp; HURRAY!! OVERWELMING RELIEF AND HAPPINESS!!!&nbsp; And... what was the other thing?&nbsp; (This isn't it but I'm going to pretend I don't have short term memory loss) I've been practicing driving around lately and as you can see, I (and the car) am in one piece.&nbsp; I've  almost  run over, let me see here, a bicyclist... a turtle... ummm, my dad and I'll stop before you think I'm a physcotic murder.&nbsp; Bye, bye!

       Thanks to some recent additions from Megan, I think its time to publish the one, the ONLY, THE MOST AMAZING list of druggie Harry Potter names.&nbsp; Amy and I were the orginal founders of this&nbsp;organization but we were soon assisted, in our quest for truth and all other lovely things, by Megan Rose W. and Kelly H.&nbsp; And YOU too can help us undercover the truth.&nbsp; Well, I'll stop being so dramatic because I know none of you have any idea what I'm talking about (as usual) so here's the short of it.&nbsp; Amy and I discovered on one fateful day, that behind every seemingly innocent character in Harry Potter (one of the best movies ever and one incrediable cutie) there is a druggie name.&nbsp; So here are some that we have discovered so far (if you can think of any others please put it in a post):&nbsp; Harry  POT ter, Ronald  WEED sly and his sister,  GIN ny  WEED sly,  HERION ime Granger, Albus Dumble DOPE , ru BEER us hagrid, Dra COCAINE  Malfoy, min HERB a McGonagall, Kingsley  CRACK elbolt... Yipee!&nbsp; Surprising how a kids movie can have so many hidden messages...&nbsp; Makes you think, ey?&nbsp;  I  J  U  S  T   D  I S C  O  V  E  R  E D  Y  O  U   C  A  N  P U  T   T  H  E  S E  I  N   C  O  L  O R  Y  A  Y  ! !

       An update from stalkers incorporated:  At the swim meet last night, there was a James sighting!! My beautiful swim coach, with his hickeys (not really) and his dinosaur tattoo was spotted 5:30 PM Eastern time (I dunno if its really Eastern time) at the FFC- Camp Chase swim meet looking as sexy as ever with a lovely tan and his usual fashion emergency type clothes. I talked to him for awhile- he's said he's sleeping this summer, packing on the calories (as he patted his beautifully beautiful abdominals), workin 12 hours a week cuz he's getting his master's degree soon. And he massaged my thumb that feel asleep and made it feel ALL BETTER! All these hot coaches... yum yum yum!  Well, seeing most people do not get as excited over my tattoo covered cutie as I do, I will move on to bigger and better things (except nothing is better than James). Today was a lovely day, with Drivers Ed- afterward I did a little driving in the East Farms parking lot. Nothing major went wrong except I ran over a couple curbs and didn't go faster than 10 MPH. And I had Munchkin Mentors again. I had Tessa today and she loves swim backstroke and on our "back torpedoes" she kept crashing into my tummy, but as I say they are all so cute, you can forgive them. And we had "swim team" which was amazing because we played the "card game" where you hafta swim different things depending on the one you pick- guys do black ones, and girls do red ones and girls only had to swim 3 times- one of which was dolphin dives, underwater. Now the whole world can know how chaotic my "swim team" (and realize why I put it in those "" things) is. *Yawn. Well I have a whole bunch of things to do, including read some of the Scarlett Letter which always makes me fall asleep. And I hafta work in an hour. So I'll talk to you later!

       Who could have thought those words could have been used in the same sentence? At my lovely swim camp, I had tons of fun even tho it was a lot of hard work. Here's the promised swim camp entry and its better late than never. Even though I had sore muscles galore todas las dias, it was absoulutely amazing. Rooming with Kim S was a blast (sxxy streamlines, composing songs in the showers, playing WAR-card game, listening to Maroon 5)- it was great. And even more awesome than that we saw "Chase Ashley" and Celeste again- our buddies from last year!!! Our daily activities included wieght room, cardio, over 4 hours in the pool, step-ups, "core", statics, medicine balls (the Walmart roundup guy will never look innocent again), 6 AM optional workouts (I did them every day but one!) and all that fun stuff. Our game at the end of the night (I never participated... I wonder why...) was Nuke 'em with a medicine ball, N-ball with a medicine ball or some great game along those lines. In our free time, we played a whole lot of cards. It started out with BS and Go Fish (no one dared to challenge Celeste to Spit) while eating these amazing physcadelic rainbow animal crackers, compliments of Ashley. They were so good that all of us kept eating them before our 100 taped IM (Kind of like a final exam) and we were afraid there was going to be 4 indentical piles of rainbow-animal-cracker-barf on the pool deck("You didn't learn that at USSC!!" lol). Anyway, then we met Gordon (who I am convinced knows magic but I'm still not talking to... if you remember why I'm giving him the silent treatment please remind me) who showed us lots of new card games (@$$hole, Mow, and Egyptian Ratshrew- I still can't figure out why its called that- which we couldn't stop playing after that. STOP THIEF!), card tricks, and some dirty jokes (that had a reoccuring theme of eating out old ladies... kind of questionable) but he smelled good so we didn't mind having him around. Ashley and Celeste are going to move into my nieghbor's shed, even if I have to drag them all the way from thier cozy homes in Massachusetts. Swim camp was a blast (I'm kinda sad we didn't do those roacket swim bench things this year...) and I might attempt two weeks next year. Well, I might as well go. Adios!

       I haven't written in centuries in a half. Actually I wrote a really long one about swim camp yesterday but then it never published and I was very mad except it reminded me of all those calculator note days where I typed a huge long thing and then presses "clear" instead of "delete". Seeing that I spent 30 minutes yesterday summerizing swim camp, I don't really feel like doing that right now but I will eventually... I promise! So instead, I'm going to talk about my very busy day yesterday. I got up nice and early for my first driver's ed class which was at 8:30-10:30. Carpooled with Andy C. and his new nieghbor (a redneck from Georgia!!) which was adventure. The class itself was very boring. The instructor is a cute little (actually he's kind of big and roly poly) dwarfish old man, with a handbar mustache!! I thought those were extinct! Joey D., HEATHYR LEE, Shawn H., Craig S., Greg S. and various other people are in it. As well as a whole bunch of people I don't know. After Driver's Ed (affectionately known as nap time), I went to Munchkin Mentors where you help little teensy cutsy kids swim like a half a lap and its so adorable. My partner for today was a 3 year old whose birthday is next month and she is the cutest girl ever and she kept hugging me but she won't do anything you told her to. Backstroke when she's supposed to be playing simon says, sitting on the stairs when she's supposed to be doing backstroke, randomly running around when we were playing Duck Duck Goose but you know how cute people get away with everything. Then I had "Big kid swim team" where I was so excited to go to seeing I thought Geoff, the sxxist swim coach ever would be there but that excitement died as soon as I discovered he's gonna be in Sunny Long Beach, CA for another week. Stupid Olympic Trials! After that, I went on an unsuccessful trek to West Hartford in an attempt to get my driver's permit but I didn't bring an "approriate envelope" so I couldn't get it. Then I came back home and went to work from 4-8. It was my first  "real" lifeguard and I got to do a variety of awesome things like sweeping the courts (and as soon as I finish someone who come and mess it up), sweeping locker rooms, emptying trash... it was a blast. When I agreed to be a lifeguard I was planning on sitting on a chair, watching people swim and getting a tan. But it was fun anyway! A 7 year old was having a birthday party and they gave us pizza and cake so that was good. Then I went to bed percisely when I got home (yay 8:00 bedtime!!) in preparation for waking up for "naptime." I'm gonna publish this and start one about swim camp but that probaly won't be finished until later.

       Ok, its like 5 minutes later but I wanted to summerize my IFTUT camp because I have nothing better to do. So it was supposed to be a "Future Teachers using Technology" came but we didn't do anything that had to do with teaching or technology- it was all about diversity. It started out pretty intrestingly with the crazed Jewish, bearded guy getting a boner (still wondering how you noticed Jen...) and our first "Life Skills" where we played all those lovely ice breaking games but we got a lollypop so it was ok. That's when I met Jen, Heather and Rosalee (affectionately known as Roey)- HEY GURLS! After that, every free chance we got, we were singing along to Grease (on a good old fashion tape player because we weren't allowed to bring anything else) and doing fill-ins, playing cards (Spit, Go fish, Crazy 8s and for me I LEARNED HOW TO DO THE BRIDGE. Major life milestone right there), dancing (learning some new moves!) and ordering chiense food. Even though, they kept picturing me Bald and cracking up, it was a great time. In the end we made skits (Yorkie poo), Personal Service Announcements, Commericials (Bozo boots, rainbow grow, Good Buy Wigs and I'm not even going to attempt Roey's) and we survived even though it was practically a jail (guess where I am right now? OUTSIDE!!!!!) and I Mrs. G didn't end up bringing me home with her- thank goodness! Well I better wrap it up. Adios! And wish me luck with another week of camp- I'm gonna need it.

      Its the morning of... I have two huge suitcases and a bursting backpack full of random things I'm not going to use.  I'm very excited because I'm going to see Celeste and Ashley again and they are my swim camp buddies from last year!!  And I've been talking to them on AIM but I still miss them.  And Kim Seelig is accompanying me... yay!  We're actually driving her there (if we have enough room to fit her in the car lol) so it'll be fun because we do all this fun stuff in the car.  We draw pictures of physcos in the engineering class, personalize scribbles, write "poetry" about random things like Pepper Ann or Cha-chings, and we're making up new things all the time.  Well, I got to go now...

      Wow... this is exciting.  Heathyr Lee is my hero and she inspired me to start one of these.  Actually I just wanted to make a comment on her page and all of a sudden... BAM! I have my own! I'm actually pretty happy because when I had AOL I had one of these and loved it but when I didn't have AOL, I was too lazy to make a new one.   I guess I should say Happy Fourth of July!! Actually, for me, it wasn't all that happy.  Since friday, when I came home from IFTUT camp all tired and cranky (I went to bed at 11:30 EVERY NIGHT   aren't ya proud of me?) there were like 700 thousand random relatives already to spend the weekend in my house.  Lovely... Except it wasn't cuz they were all old, they are always hogging the bathroom and I had to keep talking about colleges.  Anyway, this morning I was woken up to my crazy relatives for the second morning in a row and I had to entertain the spoiled little Richard who is 3 and then we had to go to my great aunt's birthday party where I sat because I didn't know any one there.  Ya, so I sat... then I sat some more... then I got a soda... then guess what I did? I sat some more!  Well, after that, I was expecting to be dragged to yet another old people party, but surprisingly they let me stay home to pack for swim camp which starts tomarrow.    Ya, that goes until the 10th so for a week or so this will be my only entry.  If I come back alive.  There's like 7 hours of excerise todos los dias and I got sore from playing badmittion with my little cousins!  IFTUT got me very out of shape.  But it sure would cheer me up, if you sent me mail there. Katie Foote c/o US Sports Camps Mount Holyoke College South Hadley, MA, 01075 Well, I think I'm going to go.  Fill out some other stuff.  And try to make a comment on Heathyr's.

       For the last two days (when I haven't been watching the Olympics, in an effort to catch a glimpse of all the sxxy swimmers esp. Micheal Phelps who has gotten the first of hopefully 8 medals- a gold in the 400 IM along with a new world record!!) I've been having to watch our pathetic tag sale.  It was so boring and its offically over except we still have so much junk that we kept it all in our garage and we might open the shop later in the week- we're all kind of sick of it right now.  Surprisingly we made over $450 except the main goal was to get rid of all the stuff in our basement and attic.  Everyone gets 25% of the profit so I made over a $100 but I dunno if all those hours of boredom were really worth it.  I hate how I can't make paragraphs because I'm on to a completely different topic and all those english teachers programmed me so I feel like I need a new paragraph.  O well.  There has been some exciting things that have happen.  First off, I'm supposed to work 16 hours next week which is awesome- that's like the most hours in a week I've had all summer.  I also finished my essay so summer work is all done.  Finally I signed up for this pre-pre-season thing at Conerstone (that looks like its missing a letter but I have no idea where!) and Sarah P and Erin are doing it so that should be fun.  They take underwater videos of us and I'm scared because I probaly make funny faces.  I'm also helping serve at Rudy's Memorial Service tomarrow so I'll see you there, if you go.  I'm warning you: I will be crying buckets because I have a tendency to do that plus these circumstances are so much more awful than all my other funerals combined.  What else?  On friday night, I slept over Amy's which was a blast in a half.  We played Scrabble, walked two miles and threw rocks off a bridge, played ONO!, watched the Olypmics and I listened to the Secret Window- JOHNNY DEPP (I watched the first 5 minutes then I decided it was too scary and hit under the covers screaming randomly for the rest of it) and did lots of other fun stuff.  O, watched the Opening Ceremony with that lady with the glowing belly and the random statue people.  That was funny but Micheal Phelps was sleeping during it and not in the ceremony so I was v. sad.  All these people are coming to dinner and I have to get ready.  Any thing else I have to say?  I think not.

       Hey! I don't really know what to put in this entry.  I went to Fairfield University this morning, accompanied by Ash H. which was fun- that looks like a good school, too- they all look the same.  I also went to the FFC for the first time in like two weeks (because I'm not working at all... GRR!!  Did I tell you?  I got called back for a second interview at the YMCA- I'm going to work weekends during the school year) and saw the Glorious Geoff and talked to him a little... mainly about the Olympics (opening ceremony tomarrow... I'm so excited to see if Micheal Phelps can break Spitz's record!!!) and some what about colleges but we don't have too much in common seeing he has a full scholarship to Harvard and had a ton of offers from billions of other schools and I am just an average student who does not exhibt any extraordinary talents and will never get a full shcolarship anywhere.  Kelly and I are going up to Boston next week to look at BC and Tufts.  Summer work report: I only have the "Politics and the English" questions to answer then write the essay about "A collection of essays" in general then I'm done.  I've been trying to do one a day but I'm having a hard time motivating myself right now.  What else have I been up to? Lots of driving, lots of talking on the phone, we've been organizing for a tag sale on saturday... please come so we can quickly get rid of all our junk.  Well I'm really gonna try to get that essay done... I can't wait for my sister to come back from her haircut- she's getting 10 inches off for lock of love (she's a lot braver than I'd ever be) and I guess she's practically going to have a shaved head when she returns.  This will be a sight to see!!  Well "Politics and the English language" here I come!

       Finally driver's ed is over, once and for all (hopefully...) and I'm FREE!! No more 7 AM wakeups, no more carpooling with guys who don't talk, no more "I almost didn't make it here to class this morning" from the teacher with the handlebar mustache who thinks that everyone is trying to kill him. HIP HIP HURRAY!! I will have to admit I will miss Heathyr Lee's smiling face and Shawn's random stories but I'm very excited! Anyway, I just came back from an amazing four day not-exactly-camping (we sold the trailer- WAHHH!) in Pennslyvania. We were very busy as usual doing tons of different things. We looked at two colleges- Marist College and University of Scranton and they were both awesome- how am I ever going to decide? One of my tourguides was very cute and his name was BEN! Then we went to two mansions- one was the smallest of the 17  Vanderbuilt mansions- actually they called it a "cottage". But it was huge and marble-y and Mrs. Vanderbuilt's room was a replica of the queen's in the Palace of Versailles! In those days, the husband and wide didn't share the same room- and that's when every couple had like 10 kids!! Wierd... What else did we do? We went horse back riding except we rode donkeys. It was really funny because when we called them donkeys, this grizzly old cowboy who worked there went crazy, got very mad and yodelled (not really but I love that verb) "THERE AINT NO DONKEYS ON THIS PROPERTY!!!" except, unfortunately for him, they were donkeys. We went on a six mile kayak, which is quite a bit of hardwork. What else? We hiked to waterfalls, went to a railroad museum, went to a Old Jail- oOoOoO! This was pretty exciting. There was this guy who was sentenced to be hanged but he was innocent. So he said "I am going to leave my handprint on this lovely jail cell wall as a reminder to all generations that this Monca Chunca county (yup that's what its called) hanged an innocent man!!" So with a forceful pat, he left his handprint and for 20 years afterword, people tried to plaster over it, scrub it off, paint over it, one guy even bowled over the wall then put it back up but its still there to this very day!! Pretty cool, ey? There was more that we did... we went shopping A LOT! We went to the World's Biggest Outlet Stores, World's Biggest General Store (with the World's Cutest Cashiers- well not officially...) and Steamtown Mall (that name cracks me up but it was a nice mall) so I had fun, spent all my money and seeing I'm not working at all this upcoming week that is not very good. Actually I went to the YMCA today and filled out an application to work there next year and I'm gonna talk to Aquatics guy tomarrow. With 3 APs, swimming in the fall and winter, crew in the spring and working on the weekends I'm gonna have no life!! Well I'm gonna try to do some medicine ball workout! Btw, this clock is always completely wrong so some entries it says I wrote at 3 in the morning and, hate to take away the veil of excitement and spontentity, but I am sleeping at that unreasonable hour.

       Sometimes I really wish I could spell.... :( O WELL! First things first- Megan the most amazing person on the face on this planet thought of two new druggie names- Madame HOOCH (Hooch is supposedly a slang word for alcohol... you learn something new every day!) and seamus finniGIN. As I just said- she's amazing beyond compare. Anyway, Kelly H. and I had a very nice day yesterday visiting Holy Cross and Assumption colleges- both of them look amazing (but Providence still is my favorite) and Worcestor (Wocestor wahoos!) was a lot nicer than I expected (and I learned its the 3rd largest city in New England!) It was a lot of fun looking at my Orlando Bloom magazine and playing Guess Who in the car (no GO FISH!). O yes and we both devored like 5 of the most delicious brownies in the world. I got to visit with Ashley C. for about 5 minutes while she was lifeguarding- she was very tan from her adventures in Florida (swimming with the dolphins- grr... I'm so jealous!), wearing her rockstar sunglasses and she has some pretty cute co-workers!  That was a very nice day and now I've toured 4.  And I'm taking tours at 3 more this weekend and walking through another one.  All of them look so good- I don't know how I'll ever decide.

       I had a fun early-birthday celebration day with Ash H.  (There are way too many amazing Ashleys in this world)  Well first this morning I ran some errands and got some more anti-frizz stuff to add to the army of serums, leave-in conditioners and gels i have.  So we'll see how that works.  Then I did some driving then Ash came over and we played foosball, teeensy weensy pool, and ping pong (we got 87... o ya!).  Then we went swimming and unfortunately no sightings of Afro or the glorious Geoff.  Then we went to Friendly's and ate some dee-licious chicken quesadillas and sundaes.  Then we went shopping nearby and were horrified to find AC Moore does not have any fabric but everything turned out ok in the end.  I'm talking to a million people online and this is getting crazy so i'll go.  Bye!

        Hey- this is my 12th post.  Well into the double digits so I'm excited that I have stuck with it.  The past two days have been kind of fun and mainly I have nothing better to do so I'll update.  Sunday, I worked 2-6 which is good because I need hours very badly (o;O;o;O;o... I should get another paycheck this weekend!!)  then I went to the Drive-in in Pleasant Valley (Litchfield- but Pleasant Valley is such a cute name) and saw I-Robot and King Arthur (it was a double feature).  I-Robot was pretty good and King Arthur was the most boring movie I've ever seen- I fell asleep after the first couple minutes then woke up when he became king so at least I saw the most important part.  I didn't get home until 1 and had to wake up bright and early for driver's ed the next morning.  After my normal drivers ed class (where coincidently we learned not to drive when you are tired), I went for my in car instruction where we drove to Bristol, practiced driving in traffic and changing lanes.  It went pretty well and he barely used his brake or my steering wheel- now I only have 3 in-car instructions to go and only 2 more classes!! Midterm on thursday.  After I got home I babysat from 1-5 and made some money.  Then I baked an assortment of blueberry things for Habit for Humanity.  After that I went to bed really early- 3 people called and my mom was embarassed to admit I was sleeping.  Today, I had driver's ed (Kelly made up a class in our session so it was exciting.  And I talked to Eliot "one L one T" and he's working as a janitor in our school which is kinda wierd. Ash is coming over pretty soon- we're gonna hang out then go shopping and out to eat later.

       Thanks to Kim S., I finally got to go to the beach in  summer !!! (My dad is physcotic as all of you know and one of his idiosyncracies- VOCAB WORD- is he takes us to all these beaches in the winter but refuses to go near one in the summer.  So I got very excited when I had the oppurtunity).  It was a fantastic day, starting off with writing notes to each other in the backseat of her car on the way down (great suggestion for people with eavesdropping parents) and then I got to see thier cute little house, which is adorable and it even has a loft which is just amazing.  After that we went on a boatride which was a lot of fun even though we hit another boat, we went some where it was too shallow and we had to push the boat and the policeboat pulled us over for going too fast in a no wake zone.  But as I said, it was an adventure!  We went to Hamburg Cove and went swimming and ate some delicious just jelly sandwiches.  Yum yum yum.  Then we went to the beach, checked out cha-chings and possibly the worst lifeguards I have ever seen.  (Not bad looking but they rarely even looked in the direction of the water)  After taking a nice cold shower, we went off to eat at this cute Greek place and I had a dee-licious meatball grinder.  Yummy in my tummy.  And continued on the way home, writing notes in the backseat.  It was a blast and a half and it was great to see Kim again!
