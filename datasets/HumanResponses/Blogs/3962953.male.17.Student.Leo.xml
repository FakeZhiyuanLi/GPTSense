      Hey there people,   Considering that our newest member of the comic, Cameron's pet 'Steve, the lake goblin', we've had some interesting issues about his existence. We were wondering what you thought about Steve entirely existing and purely being a man slaughtering ravenous manically blood driven pet, a monster that truly exists but the rest of the gang doubts the existence of until Cameron has to prove Steve's existence, or Steve existing entirely in Cameron's sub-conscious until he is yanked forth from some kind of odd situation?  Or anything else for that matter...  Just post your comments, and we'll be all,  "Woah...your ideas suck ass..."  haha, just messing. Thanks in advance people.  p.s. Steve came from Lake Berryessa in so. CA

      Well, here is mah new place to write out some of the random occurrences that dont make it to the comic, which will be up soon... just wait.  Tomorrow I should have a pretty good story to share, after all, these things happen to me all the time, hence the creation of Empty Space... actually, I should start another post for the plot behind Empty Space, for those who are curious...... I will do that, laterZ, rite now.... its time for sushi, w00t w00t.

      Okay now, here I am once again with mah story/plot post that I said I  would do...  I'm not gonna post the actual scripts, thats kinda... Ryan's domain...  being the... writer and all........ so... yeah...  The first thing that everyone needs to understand is that Empty Space  is based off all the members of this Weblog, plus a few who aren't on  ::coughcough:: Cameron ::coughcough:: since he got his net taken  away... I'll bet any one of you can guess why a guy would get the net  taken away...........  Anyways, Empty Space pretty much sums up all of our personal  experiences... err, well... some extremely random experiences... for  example, when Cameron, Ryan, Kevin, and I were at Lake Berryessa the  other weekend, Cameron wouldn't STFU about 'Steve' and 'Steve's  Mother'. This was only 1 of the EXTREMELY hilarious things that  happened that weekend, off the top of mah head I can recall around 7  things just like this that happened...  Okay, that's the summary of the comic, and its origin, anyways, the  plot:  keep lookin' you won't find one of these things... pff, 'Plot', what  kind of idiot cares about a plot, this is supposed to be a 'RANDOM'  comic of 'RANDOMNESS'........ R-A-N-D-O-M, got that?..... good job.  O wellZ, the reason this Weblog is going to be used is so that we can  get feedback on, one: Ryan's scripts/Stories of randomness; two: mah  artwork for the comic... and just some of mah artwork... whenever I get  bored....... shutup, its goin here anywayZ.  Wow this post is getting VERY long, o well... im kewl that way,  muhahahaha.  The next thing I will ask Ryan to post about, is the 'Alternate Space'  (name in the worx) this is the sub-universe of Empty Space, it involves  some even more random things that happen to all of our 'alternate  egoes'. I'll let Ryan explain our....... karazy selves, all Ima say is  that im 'Jynx'... I kick ass..... you know its true...  Okay, ima go now, mah fingers hurt from typing, and im getting  hungry..... Curry time, w00t w00t.

      Okay, so to start things off, I figured I would think up some rules and guidelines... however that's spelled........ wait... spellcheck, kick-ass.................... hey it's rite, w00t.  anyways, for new peeps here are the rules: 1. No spamming, unless it gets the message across, admins may edit out the spam, and leave only the message, or delete the post all together if it has no meaning...  2. Post titles, this isn't really THAT necessary, however I would feel much better if the titles given to the posts were related to the posts themselves, admins may also edit the titles to a related term, or to a default term as well.  3. No offensive dialog, I know that this appears on ALL forums, and such but it really does make sense when you think about it, now how would you feel if someone cussed you out on the weblog, and you had NO way of finding them, just so you could beat the living crap out of-em...... I wouldn't like that too much............. if anyone I know tries it...... I swear, i WILL beat the living crap out of-em, just watch, most swearing is alright, however, if used in an offensive manner, you will be warned...  4. Feedback, whenever anyone posts either their ideas, or comments, they are to be seriously taken into consideration... Unless however, its just an offensive thing..... in which case, they will have the living crap beat out of-em if I can find em, thank you.  ALSO: feedback should NEVER be rude, completely negative, or give the person no credit, doing so will, once again, cause some beat-age of living crap... Thank you again... that's about it, if anyone does something which ANY of the admins find rude, or not appropriate, it will either be removed, edited...

      Okay, although Ryan said we wouldn't be able to do this... we kinda  WILL do it, cuz its the whole reason this weblog was made... to discuss  the various characters that you meet in both Empty Space, and Alternate  Space. BTW: Ill have some art work for these characters in a few days,  I have to go around school, and an ROP class... so... yeah...  anyways, the main characters of Empty Space are:  Me (w00tness) Ryan Jeff Kevin Shinji Trevor  The secondary characters of Empty Space are still being decided on, but  here is the list so far:  Cameron Justin Thomas Phil  Thats it, the only reason that last names weren't included is for  security reasons, and since if you think you know who is in the comic,  you would already know.  Now, the main characters of Alternate Space:  Jynx (w00tness, lol) Crazy Ryan Fluffy Rage (name in the worx) Mr. Monotone Roadkill  These characters are listed in the same order as the above list, they  are all the 'alter egoes' of the above listed ones...  Secondary Characters:  Twitch (name in worx) (name in worx) (name in worx)  These are all the characters that we have come up with for the comic so  far, any suggestions for personality, or artistic look are great,  please post them, or comment on this post, thanx xP

      As Cory mentioned, I am the primary writer, and this is a massive help upon getting ideas for the comic. So, if any of you have ideas, I'd like to first foremention that you may e-mail me, but to prevent any spamming, I won't post my address here. You can access my site, actually my photography website, via the side link tool bar titled "Negative Space". Woah, we've got a lot of spaces now don't we ;) Just head to the contact section on that site and give me a ring, Thanks a ton!  Now, going into what I was going to talk about,   Cory wanted me to inform you all about the secondary side world of Empty Space. You see, a majority of ourselves have somewhat crazed and sadistically manic side ego's, so, since practically every person in the comic has one, we have dedicated an entire world where these cool guys can hang out, drink coffee, and do whatever crazy ego's do in their spare time.  I really don't want to give away the side ego's too much because it sort of ruins the impact factor it'll have on all of you once you see em'. So, for the moment being, just keep in mind that they all probably could be legally deemed medically insane ;)  Onto the whole Steve thing. Steve was an incredibly hilarious idea, and from the last two comments to my last post, We've decided to have it where Steve truly does exist, but Cameron has to prove his existence to us. Some of the comments have all ready given me some ideas. I have decided that for copyright reasons, I will only let out episode scripts on the site, if the demand is truly there let alone, after the comics have been forged with the scripts.   In any case, there's not much else I can say. I would like to encourage that any of the team members have an idea to openly post it, but make sure not to give it all at first. I'm sure Cory won't agree with me, but I have my own certain paranoia issues with copyright and all that. Don't specifically aim your ideas of being episodes, but just relate a story you've had or would feel would be prime material, and we'll see if it'll work.  I better be heading off, I just wrote this after coming home from work and now my wrists are going to kill me.  Take Care!

      Apparently, a few people considered that Cory was in a gang because of the massive amount of Red he wears. This intrigued me to form something of another episode around Cory's widespread fascination with the color red.    However, to elongate on it, is there anything ideas involving this obsession Cory has into a story?    Post your comments and Thanks in advance 8-)

Kevin was drawn very nicely, I am very satisfied wit it - unfortunately  mah scanner is still out of it, so I cant get this up for a few days... I gots ta  get Ryan to scan mah stuff for me...  Anyways, once they are up, let me know what you all think...

      Well, today was one hell'uva a day for empty space ideas. Cory and I walked down to Quizno's and Coldstones and on our way down there we discussed how we would implement the alternate ego's of our characters.  Ultimately, we concluded that the alternate egos will be our subconcious's acting out into our daily activities - so whenever comic relieve is needed...It's alternate ego time 8-)    To be honest, I keep having troubles remembering all the funny stuff that happens to us daily so, lol, I need you guys to keep us up with ideas.    ;) I'm out for now

      Hey there guys,   I think I may have to reiterate what Cory has mentioned as a comment a few posts back. You see, as on my behalf, as much as I appreciate the ideas you guys are presenting for the comic, if you truly have anything you can e-mail me, and to personally avoid my e-mail address getting spammed, you can access my mail through my website "Negative Space"; you can find the link on the right hand side bar of this blog. You may also tell me it via AIM if I'm ever on. Don't hesitate to e-mail me or Cory about anything, Cory gets almost instant verification of incoming mail and I check my mail at least twice a day if not more. From thence forth, and as I understand thus far about how Cory wishes to run things, which I mainly agree with, this blog was designed for the purpose of us presenting the ideas for comics that we have, or, with the help of your suggestions, have conjured up and are experiencing troubles with a certain element to the plot or a scene, etc. It is then we post the dilemma on the blog awaiting response from you guys. Your a crucial part, true, but we need you more for feedback than ideas.   Don't get me wrong though, I don't want to deter ideas, but rather would wish for you to route them to their appropriate place. I've made many comics from AIM conversations and ideas sent through you guys, such as Vito's car ideas, but please present them to us away from the blog.   For example, a posting like  "Hey guys, I thought it might be cool to change this to that and that to this and yadda yadda!"  or  "Hey there, I thought it'd be cool to draw Ryan with fluffy clothing and driving a Ford Pinto!"  Or the like, those seem fine with me, and I'm sure Cory, but we truly don't appreciate being told what to make our comics out of.   And Cory...don't fucking touch. -_-  Thanks for your cooperation guys,

      &nbsp;I was talking to Ryan about some comic strip ideas.&nbsp; I ran it through him and he thinks it a pretty odd idea:   1) Weekly Car Drive with Vito-&nbsp; Something that happens in the car when I am driving each Firday.&nbsp; We can always find something funny there.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Come up with a better name later)   2) Eating at Coldstones and/ or Quiznos and put down what happens there once in a while.&nbsp; There might be something funny.   3) A scene once in a while taking place in either the following of some ones house: Cory's house, Ryan's House, Jeff's House, Cameron's House, for good measure any one's house.   4) Some damn random funny scene in some damn random place, this once has mucho potential *wink wink* ;-). &nbsp; I am going to draw up some of&nbsp; the scenery stuff for you guys to see or some one else is going to get there before me.&nbsp; Stupid time...when will time go backwards so I can have more fun :-D!

I'll add this post to the Admin Notices.  By the way, if this 'random' thing that your posting is comic material, you can e-mail it to me or Ryan, just find out e-mails, or use the 'Contact' button below the side-bar, however from now on, regardless of how well-thought out the thing that your poating mite be, I will erase it without even considering it.  (mail spammers will be banned, and have their IP banned as well)  I am not joking around about these rules at all so dont even think about testing me.

      Hey guys,  Well, currently the project is moving forth. Cory is out of summer school so he'll have more time to work with the comics and I'm slowly piecing together some of the scripts for later comics. The only road block we currently have is that Cory will be out for some time during the month of August doing family trips and I'm not fully sure when he'll get back, but we're going to try to piece things together soon enough.   Now that I think of it, Cory and I have to finish up his makeup work for video, I've got to work days to record a demo, record the demo, have a gig on the twentieth of August (of which if you feel like coming, visit our website which is still under development - www.void-music.com - for details), and and have some time leftover for the comic.   It appears that after all, not much work is going to get done during August, possibly, but it's all fitting together and we never know.  Keep your eyes peeled.
