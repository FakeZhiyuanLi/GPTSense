      Lol, it has been pointed out to me that i have not been  posting in over 2 weeks. To tell u the truth i have soooo  much to talk about but most of it i dont realy wanna say  so ill say the stuff i can. Today was allright i guess, i wasnt as depressed as i was  yesterday, thats mostly cuz i was up till like 11 pm last  night speaking to meeka on da phone.   i went to the beech westerday, god it was soo boring, but  it have me a chance to listen to the audio book i  downloaded of queen of the damed, it was pritey kool, man  vertually all vampires are gay, whats up with that?    anwyays i woke up this morning with the words pain in my  wrist, i still have it now and its killing like hell,  first up today i had visual arts and i couldnt fukin do  anything cuz my wrist hurt, at recess i just sat with  megan and tim in the library while megan sat there cutting  out these little multicolored stars. yeah i got kinda  bored just sitting there but it wasnt like there was  anything better to do.   i had math next and i had a fukin test , to my surprise i  ddint do as bad as i though i would do, lol, but thats  partially becuase me maida and bec were exchanging  answeres, the teacher didnt care he was helping au and  telling us how to do it anyways. after math i had computer  and i was so tired so i just sat there and closed my eyes  and day dreamed.   at luch i sat with megan, tim, aaron, and some other  people. megan was cutting out those damn stars again. i  was bored so i picked up the scraps that megan was cutting  and i licked one side and stuck them all over my face,lol.  damn i was bored.   after lunch i went to the toilets to get changed for sport  and i felt the depression kicking in again so i just  chaned my shorts and then just sat on the toilet  seat,everything was peacefull and quiet untill ben and  chris cam in i chould tell it was them just i heard there  voice, i kept sitting there as they started to get  changed in another cubicle. hmm.. and then they started  talking about me, why were saying this crap and i just got  pissed off and left.   my mum is making me peel the god damn potatoes so ill write more later.

Anyways we just wached a couple of "scary" movies which were just fukin booring as hell and i was cold all night!!, i guess u could say i just had a sucky night, we played a little basket ball and me and lisa went rollerblading a couple of hours before people&nbsp; started to show up which was alright.im actually getting kinda annoyed of seeing my friends all the time, its like fukin hell i see them 5 fukin days a week and they wanna do something vertially every weekend which is fukin annoying, lol, i only was them all yesterday and they wanted me to come bowlong tonight which i so didnt want to do, so i didnt go.  on friday during school me a lisa were torturing ourselves, if u have seen teh movie "jackass" then u probly would remeber the papercut one, we kinda remade that one but we use aligaor clips&nbsp; which are these clips used in science, there these little clips withj these realy sharp teeth type things on them, anyways we put them all over bodies and then we would yanks them of each other without releaseing the clip so it hurt like thell adn usualy cu, i did it to my earsand i got this little cuts on my ear, lol, wehn my dad saw it he had a major shit at me lol, it was fun, me and lisa were adicted to the pain! lol.wehn my mum picked me up from lisa's house i went shopping with here and she bought me 3 new dvd's they are "American warewolf in london", "long time dead" and " the matrix reloaded, im waqching that now cuz wehn i brang it home i wached it but i fell asleep half way threough, wich is a good thing cuz then if anyone asks why i didnt go bowlong i can just say i fell aslee and didnt get up till 8pm.  one of my mums frinds came over and she has a daughter that goes to my skool in yr 7 adn she hates scary moves so i forced her to wach " long time dead" lol it is one of the sweetest movies ever, she shat her self figuratively speaking ofcourse.im soo bored and tired, in the pase 2 day i have only gotten 4 hours sleep, right now im talking to meeka and ches waiting fro me to finish this diary entry so she can read it, anyways im done writing so ..L8R......
