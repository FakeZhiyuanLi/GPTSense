      I was mooned for the first time in like a year. Boy do I miss the good old days. Eric mooned me and Linda. I dont think It was purposly for us but he mooned someone in his class and we saw. He has a nice ass but it looked pale and dirty though lol. Linda got pissed when I told melissa and franchi and rachel that she was going out with her new boyfriend and I told them and then she was like I dont care if you die or whats wrong in your life and that she only cares about her and her family. I thought I cared about her and I know I dont care about her family. IF SHE doesn't care about me then its over cuz its the second alarm I have got in a month. And its pissing me off. Rachel and I are friends but KJM signed on msn and told me to call erin's place to talk to emily,erin,jake, hannah and I dont know who else and they hung up later and it pisses me off. i rather not talk to them if they dont want me too. I dont have a pic of jake anywhere so like I was using sarcasm way before and they didn't get it.

      My friend Linda is really happy right now which is a major change. Because she has a new boyfriend. Lucky person. I am a little bit jealous I have to say. Since I have never had a boyfriend. Oh well. I am in computer class and My shirt and bra is white. Not fun. Taryn is going to ask Mme.Kahrer ( gollem lookalike lol) if I can have a yearbook if I pay 25.00$. And my grandma is leaving soon and my birthday is coming up so I am going to get like a nice present or money cuz she said she wanted to get me a good present since 13 is a special year.

        I was at a stupid art gallery and i became disturbed at these weird art videos by Jean Cocteau... i was so scared. Anyways then the family went to this good nice family restaurent called L'acamdemie and our waiter was really cute. Then we game home and then Julia and I "studied" for a while mom and dad were grocery shopping. Oh what fun then I tasted a martini which suck. Its true taryn and then I had a shower then got majorly sprayed by Julia and then I played cards with my grandma and then had a whole bunch of vegetables and then finally here I am typing my new blogger. And on the phone with my best friend Taryn who just moved and has bathroom for herselve. Sooo not fair. And I had a dance recital yesterday and it was cool. I did pretty good. Man I hate Mary-Jane and Dominque. Dominque had this dress and she was being soo snobish and it looked soo bad on her cuz she has no tits and has a belly. I laughed. Go me being mean and evil. I will write later.*Kisses & Hugs *

Mom gave me 10$ bucks and I had 10$ from Vickie = 20$ =:) I bought ghetto tinted sun glasses, a bracelet  and a shirt. Not to mention nurishing messy corn. :P Then Julia was supposed to come pick me up with my mother. Oh joy from Simon's house. And I thought she was going to get her nipples pierced. Ouch!!! And mom would of freaked but Julia couldn't find the place. Luckily. Then Simon was supposed to go to a party but decided to sleep over "chez moi".Which was fun except for when Mom blowed up over nothing...When she was being completely hypocrtical I shook my head and she I was teasing her. How could she when she insulted everyone! Anyway. I wasn't happy since she did it infront of simon. And we went to walk lucy at the park and he found it was stupid the way she reacted. We stay there until like 9:30pm. Which was very cool. Then he wanted to pick up this evil, drugee styled jacket but i didnt want him too so he didnt. Or else he would of got "enguler" by my mom and his mom. Next day: Went to ikea. Got materiel for pillows that my mom is going to make me. She offered a summer pass to "LaRhonde". Which would be cool since Lilly has a pass too. Monday: Linda came over around 4pm and we had fun...tanning... And cuz we were in our bathing suits. I had to do my chest. And my top fell down infront of her. Which was not too embarassing since she had already seen me topless/braless when we had to try on bras at lasenza in the same change room...Then we had fruit popcicles. Is that how you spell it? Then we went swimming at the pool across the street from my house. Totally hot guy lifeguard was there. And me and Lilly were playing with the foam sticks...lol... our first boners!!  Then we had pizza at my place. Then dropped her off at metro. Then she came back to my house to get her glasses which she forgot. The dumbfuck...lol jk...then walked her back to metro then got tired. AND Went to sleep. Tuesday: Went over to Vickie's place. She got her new shoes. Puma copies.

       A friend is someone who knows all about you and still likes you.  Today was incredibly fun. I never knew I could have soo much fun and learn soo much about two people in a day and a night. I thought my party would of been just okay since Linda and Vickie are the only ones who could come. Since I learn the night before I got 79.12$ cdn from my mami, I had to pick Vickie up earlier to go to the bank then Vickie and I chilled "chez moi" and then we walked to papineau metro and we waited for Linda when she showed up like 10 minutes late. No biggie then it was instant bonding started then and there. we were laughing and being silly. But laid back. No worries. And as soon as we went into the first clothingf store Linda started to capote ben red when we got to kokawaii. She can look so hot if she has the clothes. She said before we went out that she's fat which is sooo not true. She's a small. I did sort of feel left out not being able to wear string bikinis. But i DIDN'T try one on. But linda has small woes. But I tried on a two piece at bikini village and it looked nice. But 144$ but I found a gorgeous halter tankini bathing suit at the gap for 51$ and I bought a skirt from moto, 2 woe supporters, one for me and one for linda, two flossers for me and one for vickie ( I cant believe she wants to wear them now. My baBY'S are growing up. Linda fits a 34A. I am 36A and vickie's 32A almost B the lucky bEACH. She loosk the best in bikini's but linda has a nice stomache like Vickie. oh well. Then we got on the metro adn had some laughs. Their new nicknames Vickie=Blue Sea and Linda=Pink Limonade. Man Linda looked sooo damn hot in a pink and yellow dress. Grr. Stupid Love Handels. Anyway I got some cool stuff. I was really happy. then we all chilled and then got money to rent videos. And of course linda asks if we can talk my dog for a walk. We ate popiciles while we walked. Not good since Vickie and I were totally messy and then Lucy took a shit and I felt like I was sugar high and weird people were talking to us. And a weird french guy asked if Linda frenched good and said he did.ewww..he was ugly and rude and fat and ew. And then we rented scary movie 3, hot chick in french oops and bring it on. Scary movie 3 is sooo lame and not funny. Hot chick is booring in french and linda couldn't stay long. But it was still fun. It wouldn't of been this fun without out her. Cuz she got all excited and shit. Lol. We should do it again gurls!  A Good friend would be there to bail you out of jail, a BEST friend would be sitting next to you saying "damn that was fun"

        You dont remember me but I remember you I lie awake and try so hard not to think of you But who can decide what they dream? And dream I do... I believe in you I'll give up everthing just to find you I have to be with you to live to breathe you're taking over me Have you forgotten all I know and all we had?    Today was pretty normal.BaD AS usual. I didn't go to my last dance recital. I couldn't. I would of cried on stage. Plus I needed to do a lot of studying. Which I did most of. Since I have a french exam tomorow at 9am.Which is two freaking hours long. I am going to wear my yellow hoops from laurie which I got yesterday w/ my american eagle outfitters jeans with my old navy top prolly with the skinny white belt I got for my birthday yesterday.Yesterday I got 30$ to spend at old navy, 50$ from my french grandmother, 20$ from julia, a camera, special shampoo for colored hair. Since my hair is streaked ( or a little more than that) blonde. Its a bit pale but it will change. I also got a cow photo frame then my immortal cd from simon and spend the night by the donnas cd from laurie plus 3 pairs of earings. I feel really sad. I went to farfelu to get a photo album that i WAnted for a long time but it wasn't there. I kind of blame my mom since I have been begging her to get me it for my birthday and she didn't give me my allowence. So there. I am always mad at her. She always does something to mess the relationship. I really do hate her.

      I feel completelty.......hungry, warm (not hot for once since its really cold outside) and unsafe. Hungry: normal..lunch next period.yay. warm its 29 degrees in my computer class and I have just realised it smells like shit. And I am guessing it's my teacher since he is very unhygenic but it  is disgusting that he doesn't know when to go to the bathroom. Unsafe: Because I came into computer class with my twik shirt. The teacher caught stef macdonald first then he got me first. Then I stopped dead in my tracks and wouldn't move mo matter how many times he yells. And then he ( mr.steinberger = he btw) calls me MEGGY POO!!!!!!!!!! Normally this wouldn't completely freak me out but since he is a pedafile its more dangerous. I had more mistakes when he was correcting my first page and he didn't count them. He does that to girls all the time. Ewwwww. I'll write more later.
