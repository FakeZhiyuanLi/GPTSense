      Well after two days of playing I have found that still enjoy the game but there are some people I don't enjoy playing with. I know some great players people who know the classes and skills of those classes... And others well don't. One of my players seems to think that her characters are always a teenagers. No matter how much direction you give her or background you ask for they are just lost.  I think I will always play but I don't think I want to play with her anymore... I hope she lives long and plays... Somewhere else  Angie

      Well I found a way to fix my problem of not having an employee for my show in southern Calif... Don't go to the show. Hehe this seems like an extreme measure but if you have ever driven to far far away ( also known as San Diego) then you know that the drive takes you through the more seenic parts of this lovely state lots and lots of open cow country. (OMG the smell!!)  I have to say that I am glad to not have to go to the show. It is a 9 hr drive at least and you can not drive on the lawn (hand carring all  my goods over the lawn is the pits).  this will mean missing the income from the show will not help but oh well sometimes you need to do what is best for your body and soul as apposed to what is good for your wallet.  Angie  PS I am going to kill Mike when i get the chance.

      Ok so today of all days (one day before a show 9 hrs from home) I had my employee tell me he is not sure  he can go all the way to So Cal with me for a show!!! Gah, why do people do this to me!! They know that finding help last min is damn near imposible.  I mean come on who can just drop everything and go to so cal for three days! well no one I know.  Now I am stuck with no help and no way to get help, and a nine hour drive ahead of me!  Oh how wish my shadow could work for me, Ang

      Well I started this to talk about the things I do in my life. I hope to keep things positive and interesting, so what better place to start then at the begins, or at least the present.  I am 26 years old and I live on the west coast of the U.S. I am in a long term (very long... OMG long...like almost longer the most marriages I know) relationship with a man I love very much (big honking understatement but hay). We have been together almost 10 years (in Feb) We have had our fair share of ups and downs... LOL but hay who hasn't. The question people ask me the most, when they hear how young we are and how long we have been together, is do we fight... Hell yes we fight all the time about things that don't seem to matter much in the long run (who's turn it is as dishes? And  How  much did those shoes cost again?) In the long run we are happy.  I have the worst job in the world; I sell swords and knives to people at the renaissance fairs and Scottish games all over the west coast... Now I know what your thinking. This sounds like a dream job, right? Wrong I have to drive for upwards of 8-9 hours every weekend to get dressed up in clothes that are not made for 100 degree heat and play like I am in the 1400's. I endure fat girl jokes and stupid questions (like can I shapen this dagger? Yes you can shapen it and please when you are done cut your self some place it will bleed a lot and you will no longer be in the realm of the living!! Or is it a real knife?... No its fake steel that looks just like real steel and is just as sharp you dim wit now buy it and move on!!!!) If this was all the hell I had to deal with in my job I would be ok but no I also have to lug 2 tons of sharp pokie pointies all over hell and back, and just to make matters worse I have a bad back that always wants to act up at the worst time. When I get to the hell that I will be spending my weekend in I then have to set up a large pavilion in the heat and spared out my wares for others to see. This takes about 4 hours, and not that long you say... Try doing that in 100 degree heat after you drive for 8 or 9 hours.  Why do this you ask and not get a real job?? Good question, well I started this job with the man I love and it made good money at 1st but as the economy slipped we started to not do so well. We decide to get him through school so we would have a stable income but that does not change how much I hate this job!  Well the last thing to talk about is hobbies, I have a few (sometimes it seems like a few to many) I play Everquest on xev server and I have a 65 pally with 250 aa's this means very little to the average reader but hay I learned to play to keep up with my geeky friends and then I was hooked (did I mention that the man I love plays... LOL) I also play D&amp;D 3.5 ed I am in a game that meets one time a week, we are all 10th level and have been playing for some time now. In that game I play a cleric to oagmah (SP). I also enjoy coloring large posters and taking photo's with my digital camera (maybe some day I will get brave and post a pic)  well that is all I can think of at the moment, more to come..
