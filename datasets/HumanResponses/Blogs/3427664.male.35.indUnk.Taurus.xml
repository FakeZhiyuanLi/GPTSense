       The Lakers have defeated the Wolves, woohoo!  In the midst of the most chaotic season I can think of the Lakers have done what was thought to be probable and then improbable.  And now we await the puny East so that we can stomp all over them. Isn't it funny how sports fans like myself say "we." After all I had so much to do with the victory.

        urlLink Study: Driving Longer Means Larger Waists     This story is one of many that really help to hammer home the message that your employment has a tremendous impact upon your quality of life and not just from a financial perspective.  It impacts your mental and physical health in dramatic fashion. Just think, if you hate your job not only does it make you crazy but now we see that in addition to the stress if you are commuting long distances it can make you fat. How about a Big Mac, or do you want to be a dope.  Not very surprising to read this, but it does assist in reminding us that when we evaluate potential employment we should consider quite seriously things like the commute as well as money/benefits/advancement.

      Friday is always a rough day at the office, although the magnitude of that may vary somewhat. My job requires high energy, perserverance and tenacity and the ability to think outside of the box.  I can do all of those things, but I find that it takes so much energy that by Friday I am starting to lose some of the edge. It is not a horrible thing and it is not that I cannot bring my "A" game, but it is just that much harder to pull it all together.  Fortunately the weekend is here and it should   be slow enough that I can recharge my batteries. If nothing else if I can get 30 minutes of nap time I should be good to go. Aren't naps awesome.  When you are little it is just a tool that parents use to subjugate you keep you under the man's thumb, but when you are grown up it is just so much fun.

      Life is not always a bowl of cherries, but I'd lay odds that most people that have their own Blog have a better life than they realize. Does that mean that they do not have problems?

      I  just lost 2 hours of my life to "The Hulk." It was a horrible movie. Special effects were just so-so and the plot was weak. Thankfully it was on Starz so I cannot say that I wasted tons of dollars on it.  Although I did enjoy it more than "As Good as it Gets" which just got worse and worse. Bleah!

      We hear/read discussions regarding the necessity and the desire to find someone with a "good work ethic." It is a highly desirable trait and one that has multiple definitions because it really is subjective.  Some people are good at sitting down at a task and just working at it until it is completed. They will not take a break or stop until they are done with what they set out to do.  Others just can't work that way and do what they need to do in bursts of energy, which is the way that I prefer to work. And then are those people that are just downright lazy.  But a good work ethic does not mean that the quality of work is always as solid as the desire and effort to work hard. Sometimes you are placed in situations in which you are just wearing the wrong hat, you don't have the right tools for the job. It requires a flat head and you brought a phillips screwdriver.  That being said I am placed in a position all the time where my clients ask me to do their work for them. None of them have the balls to come out and just ask me to do it, but nonetheless they do. It makes me crazy. I have enough work to do without those lazy bastards adding to my workpile. If I wanted more work I'd tell Dubya to step aside and begin my own reign of terror. Bwahhahah.

      I spend my days speaking with people about their marketing goals and objectives and how I can assist them with meeting those. I am a Senior Account Executive, but you could call that a euphemism for "salesman."   When I was younger I never had any intention of becoming a salesman, but I just kind of stumbled into it and found that I am not too bad at it. All it requires is the ability to tell a story, listen to the response and then respond to it.  Aside from the cold calling the hardest part of this job is having to listen the nonsense the buyers foster upon me. It is so much easier when they just tell me that they do not have any money because the objection is so tough to overcome.  But some of the other things I hear and see make my head spin. And they say that salespeople are dishonest. I don't know about that.

      I am growing more and more tired of celebrities who have let fame color their perceptions of their importance in the world. Madonna is one of those people. Just because you have talent and business acumen you cannot assume to have the same skills in other areas.  That is not to say that you cannot have an opinion, but I find her political views to be somewhat shallow and I find her involvement in Kabbalah to be irritating. It is a little offensive to see a person pick one aspect of your faith and exploit it for their own gain and that is how it comes across to me. I may be wrong, but I have little reason to think so.  I suppose that it is fair to say that neither Madonna or I will lose any sleep over the other's perception of each other.  She is 45, how long can she keep this charade up and when does she change and adapt to circumstances. Maybe she will and maybe she already has. It doesn't matter. If she feels so strongly about peace she can put her money where her mouth is.

      I spent time debating on how crude I would get in my Blog, it is after all my public face. But then I decided that I feel like keeping it somewhat "real." Life is really chaotic and "crazy busy" now. My father has been ill for more than a month and locked up in a hospital in New Jersey.  If I spent any more time there I might be locked up to, but for different reasons. The fercockteh jughandles are idiotic and more trouble than they are worth. If I ever run for Senate and win I am cutting off their federal funding, or enlisting Tony Soprano's crew to run things for me.  Yesterday they took blood from my arm for a basic blood count. When I removed the bandage it suddenly became apparent that my arm was bruised and discolored in a coupld of spots. I am 35, what is the deal with this bruising.  Today at my basketball game I told the guys that I caught my arm on the rim and that they should watch out or I would rain a firestorm of dunks and points upon them. Ok, I can't dunk, but I did manage to touch the rim. Not bad for a white Jewish guy who stands 5'10 and weighs 230.  I may not be very athletic, but G-d did bless me with strength, an attitude and exceptional flatulence. You never know when you need the turbo to kick in. If I didn't mention it before I am a Taurus.....

      It is May 23 for another 43 minutes or so. In a relatively short time we are about to see the next presidential election come and go. And in the interim we are going to be bombarded with information about who did what and why they are meaningful and why we need to vote for them.  Now it may be that I am a snob, no I am a snob about this, but I have little faith in the logical assessment and critical reasoning of most people. There is so much garbage spit out about the candidates and their abilities. I wish that people could and would spend more time thinking about what is being said.  It is like these knuckleheads who thought that Dean was different than the rest. Show me a real plan, something coherent and articulate and maybe we can start to speak about change.

      I have all of two minutes now before we venture into TIVO land. We got TIVO so that it would be easier to find time to watch a few TV shows that are not child friendly. It got to be so easy to watch shows that we have become Tivoized and now have way too many shows.  I think that I am going to have to go cold turkey one day or at least give up a few shows so that what little time I have reappears. That is the problem with being a reality tv junkie.  Survivor, Amazing Race and a couple others have occupied us way too frequently. I haven't spent any real time considering the ramifications of this. It dawns upon me that some people will consider me to be a part of the cultural dumbing down of America, but on the other hand I can claim to have read more books on more topics than most people. I can quote Shakespeare, Faust, Whitworth, Proust and Homer Simpson. DOH! So what, what does it all mean.  We are living in an age of information overload with so much stimulation and not much time to process or determine if these things are meaningful. And that in my mind is more important than so many other things we cry about. Really.

         Not a bad flick, actually I thought that it was quite clever and really enjoyed it. Too bad the lady near me thought that she had a better story to tell. I had images of dumping a box of popcorn on her head, but the thought of jail scares me.  Bubba and Jack can be friends from afar.  The hardest part was trying to keep my precocious 3.5 year-old son entertained. He had more fun climbing the stairs, looking over the seats and playing with his popcorn than he did watching the movie.  And come Mid-July old Jack and company will unveil the latest addition to the crew. It should be interesting.

      When I was in school Sundays used to be a time in which I would do my best to continue to forget about homework and weekday events. I remember trying to eke out every last second of the weekend, 'cuz who wanted to have to go back to school.  Most of the time I really didn't care about returning to school, it was just the principle of the matter. I couldn't be the "cool kid" without claiming to hate school at least once, now could I.  And now as a so-called adult I find that I have so many family responsibilities to take care of that I sometimes miss being at work, oy. It is not that I mind but it can get a little crazy running from store to store and family event to family event. I feel a little like the hamster on the wheel.

      I find it humorous to engage people in discussions of why they believe things to be a certain way. Oftentimes there is no real logic or rationale, just an arbitrary decision to support or not support something.  I am guilty of it sometimes too.  But the problem stems from the laziness of some people. They are unwilling to put in the time to figure out why they believe things to be a certain way. It is a good intellectual exercise to do the opposite of the slackers and spend a few minutes with yourself.  Why are you a Democrat? Why are you a Republican? What values are important to you and why?

      More random thoughts about my life in general with no particular order or meaning. My father had a younger brother who died in February of 1994, he wasn't quite 50 when he passed away.  He was gay, but not the stereotypical flamboyant gay man that you see portrayed on TV, there was no birdcage. I was just short of 18 when I found out that he was gay. I had never bothered to consider that he could be, it never occurred to me that he was anything but my uncle.  But my middle sister must have been thinking about it because she asked him. We were in San Francisco on a youth group trip and he had dinner with just the two of us. One moment I had the cool uncle who bought a beer for me at dinner and the next, he was gay. He laughed when she asked and answered that he was.  Suddenly I was posed with a dilemma as I had grown up hearing gay jokes in school. I may have even told some. I never heard them around the house, but I knew that it was something that many people frowned upon. I truly cannot remember if I spent much time thinking about it, although I know that I found it to be disconcerting. Regardless of my discomfort I reminded myself that he was my uncle and that I loved him.  And that was the end of my concern about it, it really was short lived.  It was January of 1987.    Sometime in 1989 I learned that my uncle had tested HIV+. Now my uncle became gay again to me. I remember as a 20 year-old boy who was trying to figure out who I was that I knew that my uncle was going to die and I felt sad for my father and my grandfather.  For a long time he didn't show any signs of the disease. He had trouble gaining weight, but he was always skinny. As the opportunity presented itself I would go back to SF to spend time with him. He was so similar and so different from my father. It was fascinating to me to see in some ways the man my father could have been had he not had 4 children to take care of.  Sometime around 1993 the virus decided that dormancy was not for it and the little buggers began their assault upon my uncle. It was slow at first and he fought it. We are a strong willed family and he wasn't anxious to give up. I began to do what I could to speak with him even more than I had. I really looked to him for some guidance and support. He gave me what advice he had to offer and set me straight about a number of things.  My happy go lucky uncle was dying.     I began to see little things that I hadn't noticed before, aspects of his personality that I had never been exposed to. I don't know if they had always been there or if the disease brought it out, but they reared their head for me, pretty and ugly alike.  It became more and more apparent that time was not on his side and out of necessity the drugs he took to sustain his life were increased. And now I got to speak with a drugged and not always lucid 49 year old. I didn't like it, but I didn't blame him.  In February of 1994 my uncle died of complications caused by the virus, he wasn't even 50.   Due to dumbluck, karma, kismet or whatever I got the call from SF saying that he had passed away and I got to due the honors of telling my grandfather that his youngest son had died. A short time later my mother and I let my father know that his younger brother had died. In practically no time it seemed like I had decimated a family.  No one blamed me, no one yelled at me. It wasn't my fault, but I felt empty and hollow. I had "stabbed" my grandfather and my father. I did it carefully, I tried to be tender, but the words cut them both.    My grandfather cried and I could do nothing.   Fast forward to 2003. It is August and my grandmother has a major stroke. We know that within days she will die. For all intents and purposes she is already gone, her body is a shell, more like a three dimensional picture. My grandfather held her hand and sat with her, but the look on his face said that he knew.  At her funeral he leaned against me and I realized that overnight he had aged. My poor grandfather had buried a son and two wives and time was catching up with him. It made me very aware of his mortality. I was 34 and a father and I felt like a three year-old boy. Suddenly all of his weight was leaning against me and even though I felt strength in the muscles, he felt frail.    And for the second time in my memory my grandfather cried.   Fast forward to April of this year, 2004. My sister is pregnant with her third child. On April 17th my parents left for New Jersey so that they could be there for the birth of their newest grandchild.  On April 28th my father was admitted to the hospital. Within hours he was on a ventilator and my BIL and I were discussing whether he would survive. It was touch and go and there were concerns that if I waited for any length of time he would die before I could get there.  And suddenly I realized that I might be stuck telling my grandfather that his oldest son had died. It was so unfair, I was going to be placed in a position of being concerned about whether telling him could kill him. It was bad enough telling him about my uncle, and now 10 years later I faced the prospect of history repeating.  But this time there was no other child and no wife to lean on, just a 35 year-old grandson.  Life is funny that way. So I rolled the dice and lied to my grandfather and my other grandparents about having to take a sudden business trip. It was April 30th and I caught an early morning flight to New Jersey. I got on a plane not knowing if my father would still be living when I arrived and the knowledge of all of the responsibilities left behind. Three grandparents, a pregnant wife, three year-old son and two younger sisters.  Ahead I had my mother to take care of and my sister and her kids. I was incredibly thankful for my BIL, not just because he was a doctor but because I felt some support, that there was at least one person in New Jersey that I could rely upon to help with the family.   It is June 30th now.   My father beat the odds, roll out the cliches. He survived when so many of the docs were dubious about the possibility. And now I worry about him and my mother coming home in time for the birth of my new baby. The due date is July 22, but my wife expects that we have about 2 weeks to go. She is carrying the baby, so I suppose that she should know.  I am looking forward to seeing dad come home. I am not ready to give him up and I don't want to rob my children of knowing their grandfather. What a wild year it has been. There is something fitting in seeing my folks arrive in time for the beginning of a new life.  I love you dad. Get mom on a plane and come home, please.

      I am glad to see that I am not the only one who plays this game. If only I had thought to document it, oh well.  When I graduated from College they gave us cards to fill out with our names as they supposedly appeared on our diplomas. My friends and I had a field day filling out our "real" names and then some.  Lot of interesting graduates were found that day. Not to mention that some jackass got into it with one of my fellow graduates. Basically he was there to see some family/friend graduate. In his efforts to film the ceremony he blocked our view. We yelled and asked him to move, apparently this irked him enough that he threatened to come kick our rears.  Not only that, but he said that he was going to put the camera away and that he would return to inflict said punishment. The funny part is that he pointed at us and said "I'll remember you."   I am sure that 1000 of us dressed all dressed in black caps and gowns looked very different from each other.

      Again, I agree with Mr. Prager.    One more point. When you look at the roster of the America-haters and realize that none of them hates France or Sweden, this assessment of America-hatred is rendered even more obvious. America, largely alone, calls these groups and regimes what they are — evil. America, largely alone, wages war against them. America, largely alone (with Israel), prevents them from assuming far more power.    How very true.

      Just some basic thoughts to throw out. For anyone who has been reading the board for any length of time now it should be evident that I support the war in Iraq.   I think that we did the right thing and I am happy that we did it. I am not going to run off and provide all of the reasons that I think we did the right thing. I'll say that I am disappointed in how some things have been handled and that I think that we have fumbled the ball several times.  And I also want to add that I do not buy the argument that by going in we created an environment in which millions of people are going to crawl out of bed and become terrorists.  I think that it will create new terrorists and that this will be a good recruitment tool for AQ and friends. But I think that many of those people are predisposed to this behavior and not likely to have been friendly towards us to begin with.  There are lots of ways to disagree with people/politics and most ways do not involve violence. I don't think that everyone is capable of launching murderous attacks even if they support the idea.  That being said, I believe that there are a number of things that are happening now including a polarization of sides that is being pushed by members of the fringes so to speak.  I think that there are many people who want this to become a case of Muslims versus the rest of the world and that they will continue to perform outrageous acts to fuel this desire.  What we are seeing and reading about now are more and more calls for revenge. People want blood and are calling out for action. I happen to believe that overwhelming force is going to be needed to bring the terrorists down and to force a position in which they have to use political means and not violence to negotiate their terms.  That being said I wanted to mention that I came across a site called Ogrish. It made me sad, it is "chock" full of barbaric videos of violence from the war and other places. I think that part of what made me sad is that I watched pieces of some of the videos. It was like a trainwreck, I had to force myself to stop watching.  I have seen some very bloody things in person and they were not nice, but it wasn't nice to see it on the computer either. And I couldn't help but think of the parents of these victims and how they have to face this terrible reality for the rest of their lives. It is a terrible weight.  And I think that part of what makes me sad is just my belief that the way to peace is going to require so much more bloodshed. Such a terrible contradiction, so wrong, but sometimes so necessary.  Life really is absurd sometimes.

      What a busy time in my life. Today my father was released from the hospital. He went in on April 28, so just short of 2 months later the big man has been paroled from the joint. It was a combination of pneumonia, heart trouble and a few other odds and ends and he beat the odds and came through.  I am excited by I feel spent mentally and emotionally. The problem is that there is no time to sit back and mull over these things. It won't pay the bills and it won't keep work from piling on my desk. On days like this I think that I should clone myself 2 or 3 times so that I can always be working on the things that need to be done. And since it will be my clone I won't have to worry about being in three places at once, I will be. and better yet, sorry, not sure what the better yet would be.

      It is a sad day and I feel badly for the family and friends of this poor man in South Korea. I feel badly for the family of Paul Johnson too. Slaughtered, they were slaughtered like animals.  It is ugly and it is only going to get uglier. Violence will be needed to solve this, they need a boot to the throat and an understanding that they cannot achieve their goals in this manner.  Once they capitulate there may be room for further negotiation and hopefully we can take a stance that allows for education and more progressive thought. A lot of contradictions in that paragraph, but that is life.

      I post on a medical board for a digestive disorder. In addition to providing valuable information regarding the medical concerns of this disorder there is a general "meeting place" in which lots of different topics are discussed.  Frequent discussions take place in which people assert that the problems in the ME are all because of the problems between Israel and the Palestinians. I find the ignorance of many posters to be disturbing. You can find lots of reasons why the peace process is stagnated that are a direct reflection on Israel and the Pals.  But you cannot in good conscience blame Israel for all of the other problems. Israel is not preventing free elections and or the spread of democracy in Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, Qatar, Kuwait etc.  It is the dictators in these places. It is the totalitarian authorities that feed propaganda to the masses that are preventing the promotion of peace and democracy within these countries. The blame should stay at "home" where it belongs.

      So it is another Saturday night and I am feeling kind of funky, not particularly unhappy or melancholy, but not ecstatic either. Not that there is anything wrong with that, so do I sound like Jerry Seinfeld.  In a short few weeks my second child will join my family in the "outside world" and I'll have one more person under my care. Some people are really concerned about the world, they live in fear of what could happen, what might happen not what will happen. And I am just so thankful that I am not caught in that trap.  I cannot blame people for feeling a certain way, but I cannot accept such a negative view of the world. In part because I had the good fortune to be born in the US and to have done something with my life. When I look at history I cannot help but be optimistic, there is less brutality and senseless death in so many ways.  We do not live in the Dark Ages, but it does feel like it sometimes. OTOH, we see medical advances enable our friends and family to overcome health issues that would have killed them a generation ago. So there is progress.  On a different front I must say that I want to know what the hell Jerry Buss is thinking. Jerry, you used to be the finest owner out there and now you are turning into Steinbrenner. Why?

       urlLink  : "If I am not for myself, who is for me? When I am for myself, what am I? If not now, when? �Hillel"  Worth the whole commentary:  Commentary [1:14] Today Hillel’s famous three questions are usually taken rhetorically, meaning: Look out for yourself, stick up for yourself, or no one else will; but if you are only concerned for your own selfish interests, you are unworthy; and now is the time to act.  Rabbinic commentators give a similar but more pious interpretation: only I can carry out my responsibilities to do good, and get merits by which God will judge me when I die. Maimonides adds psychological insight: a person acquires habits of doing right or wrong—virtues and vices—while young; youths should do good deeds now, and not wait until adulthood.  Hillel put these sayings in the form of questions, I believe, because he intended them to be asked and answered when we face important decisions.  If I am not for myself, who is for me? not only implies that it is legitimate to pursue your own interests, but also starts you thinking of the best way to pursue your interests. Your answer to “If I were not for myself—if I had to rely totally on others—who would be for me?” will give you a shrewd idea of who are your friends and allies, and who is not with you, or is actively opposed to your efforts. When I am for myself, what am I? asks “What should be my role in this situation?” This partly a moral question: what do I owe to others, what do they owe to me? And it is also a practical question: how should we define and share responsibilities in a way that is most beneficial to both people in a relationship?  If not now, when? is the strategic question of timing. Sometimes, we should act immediately, and sometimes we should wait until a later, more opportune moment. What is urgent? What should I postpone? What can I do now to improve my options later?  Hillel’s three questions encapsulate a philosophy of life which is a true synthesis of the ancient Hebrew and ancient Greek traditions—a synthesis at the heart of Classical Judaism. In contrast to the Greek tradition, Hillel doesn’t begin just with personal happiness as the goal, and then try to see how wisdom can lead a person to the path of goodness. And in contrast to the Hebrew tradition, he doesn’t begin just with a person’s responsibilities to others and to the community.  Hillel’s approach instead is a conscious effort to balance the pursuit of self-interest and service to others. He sees that balancing our personal interests and our obligations to others is a problem that each of us needs to solve creatively at each stage of our lives. Each time we face an important life decision, the three questions launch us and guide us on this quest for balance.

       urlLink acts of kindness, Pirkei Avot : "Choose yourself a mentor; Acquire yourself a friend; And make it your habit to judge every person favorably. �Yehoshua ben Perachia"  The first two lines are sensible and easy to do, or one would hope. One can never have too many friends. It is always good to have people you can trust, who you can share your hopes/dreams/fears with.  Community is important, we are communal creatures.  A mentor is a good idea as well. Very few of us try activities in which no one else has ever engaged in. So it makes sense to try and find a trustworthy person who can share their experiences with you and hopefully assist you in avoiding some of the pitfalls that can hit you.  The final component is really tough. It is just hard not to judge people. We are consistently forced to evaluate people and it is not easy to just ignore your first impressions.

At least you hope that you do not stagnate and that you do continue to grow.  We can find guides and recommendations on how we should live, but we cannot let others live our lives. They may share in it, but they can never truly feel our feelings or understand our thoughts. In some fashion we are always alone. But this is not a bad thing.

      Spent a few minutes considering what the last year of my life has been like and came up with the following list. Since May of last year I have had/experienced the following:  The company I was working for split into two new companies.I was sent to work for the prince of darkness and his evil consort for 8 months after which they let me go. No surprise, it was expected. For that matter it was a race to see if I could find omething better before they let me go.My grandmother died and my grandfather moved into my parents home. My wife got pregnant with our second child. My other grandmother had a series of heart issues including a major heart attack and managed to survive, but the docs are questioning how long.My sister had her third child and my parents flew out to meet the newest grandchild. While they were out there my father had a heart attack and some other major health issues. We were told that there was a very strong chance that he wouldn't make it, but he proved them wrong and two months later is healing, albeit 3k miles away from here.My sister had an emergency operation in which her gall bladder was removed, but is doing ok.  The lack of spacing is intentional because that is what this past year has been like, sort of. It really isn't close to what it has felt like, but I wouldn't expect anyone to be able to truly get it and that is ok with me. This is my burden and my task to bear.

      What can I say about that place except it is fortunate that they have a competent fire department. :)  Ok, I can tell you that it is superior to at least three other places, Buffalo, Detroit and Blythe, which could be called Blight. They haven't any sense of decorum and are not in touch with reality. Most of the people I meet from cleveland are short and have inferiority complexes. Not sure why, they must have some normal people there.  On the other hand they probably have all fled the city.  Funny, I keep receiving these silly comments from angry clevelangelenos about their fair city. So, I'll agree on the scale of evaluation it is fair. Not great, not good, not poor, but fair.

      There are several different groups of people who comment on this Blog. Many of you have my email address and I am getting swamped with comments about the comments of others here. Some of these comments make complete sense because many of you are not familiar with the BB I had been participating in and the comments about the events there do not have any context for you.  The other set of comments are in response to what many consider personal attacks. I think that there is a lot of anger coming from people who feel like they were never listened to, who feel that their opinions were devalued and in short are just trying to express themselves.  I am not going to do much in the way of moderating comments as I want this to be a place where you just lay it out there. If people can't handle it this may not be the place for them. But I ask that you use your name.  If you want to say someone is smart or an idiot, you can do that. But use your own name so that we can see what is going on. It will help to provide a real handle as to how many people are here.  Also, I am considering signing up for a tagboard which would be similar to a message board and would be on the front page. It will not be the kind of board that many are used to. I am still the only one who will post subjects, but it will serve as a general place to make comments and remarks. The posts will still offer a place for comments too.

       Here's a sneaky way to find out someone's age who won't tell you:  Ask the person to multiply the first number of his or her age by 5 Tell them to add 3 Now tell them to double this figure Have the person add the second number of his or her age to the figure and have them tell you their answer Deduct 6 and you will have their age!     Here is another      Tell someone to secretly input their age into a calculator and multiply it by 3367. Now, tell them to multiply it by 3. Next, tell them to write down their answer on a piece of paper and to clear all the information on the calculator so far. Now, use that number on the piece of paper and divide it by 10101. RESULT: The person's age!  The reason this trick works because 10101 is equal to 3367*3. And multiplying any two-digit number by 10101 is the same as writing it three times (e.g. 282828). Thus, when a number is multiplied by 3367, then by 3, it is really being multiplied by 10101. And of course, when you divide it by 10101 at the end of the trick, you get your original number, in this case your age.           And here is another              Magic Addition Trick #1  Amaze the peons with this one. It's simple. It's effective. It gets them every time. Ask your mark to pick three (3) different numbers between 1 and 9. Tell him or her (or her or him) to write the three numbers down next to each other, largest first and smallest last, to form a single 3-digit number. Tell him/her not to tell you what the numbers are. Next have her or him form a new 3-digit number by reversing the digits, putting the smallest first and the largest last. And write this number right underneath the first number. Now have him or her subtract the lower (and smaller) 3-digit number from the upper (and larger) 3-digit number. Tell them not to tell you what the result is. Now you have a choice of wrap-ups: Ask your friend to add up the three digits of the number that results from subtracting the smaller from the larger 3-digit number. Then amaze him or her by teling them what the sum of those three numbers is. The sum of the three digit answer will always be 18! Tell your friend that if she or he will tell you what the first OR last digit of the answer is, you will tell her or him what the other two digits are. This is possible because the middle digit will always be 9, and the other two digits will always sum to 9! So to get the digit other than the middle one (which is 9) and other than the digit that your friend tells you, just subtract the digit your friend tells you from 9, and that is the unknown digit.

       "You swore at him and were aggressive and hostile and you threatened him. The victim was quite blameless.

I have often remarked that in today's society you are better off not trying to touch children of people you don't know. I personally find it irritating when strangers try to ruffle my son's hair or touch him in some other fashion. Boundaries are important.  Still, what this man did was wrong.

'It's really unfortunate we have a law in this country that can make it illegal to look at the code and research the bugs and other problems, and possibly malicious code, because of the DMCA,' e-voting expert Barbara Simons said.

       ! News - John Kerry Challenges Bush Over Iraq War: "He plans to vow to build a more robust military at home and strong alliances overseas. 'And then, with confidence and determination, we will be able to tell the terrorists: You will lose and we will win.' "   Great, this is the same thing that Bush says. What are you going to do that is different. How are you going to achieve these goals. You voted for the war based upon bad intelligence. How are you going to prevent this from happening again?  Lots of questions and no answers.

      They bore me, plain and simple. It doesn't matter who the party is, they are essentially all the same. "We're better than them and if you elect us we'll show you" followed by cheers from people who already support them. Talk about preaching to the choir.  Now if you had Kerry address the Republicans and Bush address the Dems and then we heard cheers I might be impressed.

      Inquiring minds have been making inquiries about my daughter's name. She is daughter of the empress of the duchy of the earldom of Benimble. Her name includes these letters:  E, W, R and A.  Take a spin and see if Vanna can find your letter. In the interim your host, Jack B. will be right back with copies of the home game.

      I play around with this Blog for a number of reasons. It offers an easy way to keep writing and writing is a skill that requires constant attention. If you want to be better than ok, superior to just good you need to practice. In that respect it is no different from any other discipline. The true superstars in any field have ability, but it is their determination and work ethic that separate them from everyone else. So I write because it helps to keep my game sharp.   I write because it is an easy way for me to take a quick internal snapshot of how I feel about things. And I am one of those passionate people who often feels things that are important to me so deeply that&nbsp;I can taste the emotion. As goofy as it sounds, I can easily see myself running with reckless abandon through a moonlit field, howling at the sky. Just give in to the feelings and let them flow, don't force them down, don't stuff them into that little cage, let them out and run wild. It is very liberating.   I am not sure how many people are truly that in touch with why they feel a certain way. And truth be told it doesn't matter to me whether they know or not, it is only important because my understanding of my own internal operations makes Jack a happier boy and that is significant to me.   I also write because I serve as a guide to my children. They will grow older and they will learn what it means to live in the world and if I do my job they will be men and women of character and integrity. But that doesn't mean that I can provide all of the answers and I really wouldn't want to do that. There are some things that are better learned through personal experience. Nonetheless I want to help them however I can and I think that there is something of value in reading what my thoughts and interests are/were.   So as I sit here listening to Sinatra ( It Was a Very Good Year  just finished and now  My Way  is coming on) and prepare to add to this little diatribe. In high school JohnnyW., Daryl C., Sharon B.,t and Charlie B., died. I knew them all and not one made it past their 19th birthday.   In&nbsp;the years since&nbsp;I learned of the suicides of Michael B. and Jordan F. Brian G., David A., Adam M., Clark D. and Wendy N., all died of one form of cancer or another (I used initials because there should be a little privacy for the families) and none of them lived past 33. I am 35 and look at this list. I hate to say it, but they are not the only ones I could name.   Karen L. was hit by a car while riding a bike in Europe and died.&nbsp; And there are others that&nbsp;I cannot think of now. But I think that 12 people is a  decent  list. Now maybe there is nothing unusual in being able to name that many deceased, but since they were contempoaries of mine I suspect that I know more than most.   What that tells me is that I have plenty of reasons to be happy that each day I am given a new lease on life to suck out the marrow and experience as much as I can. Sure sometimes it sucks, but what are you going to do to me, make me an alcoholic eunuch. Not likely, I was built to sustain and endure, I don't know any other way. Not ego,&nbsp;just the way it is.  During the last 12 months I have had the following experiences: My company&nbsp;split&nbsp;into two new companies, I was laid-off by one and hired by the other, my&nbsp;grandmother died, my&nbsp;other grandmother had major heart problems and was not expected to make it but did, my sister gave birth, my father had an&nbsp;unexpected&nbsp;major health crisis and was not supposed to live past the weekend. He surprised the docs and has since had a triple bypass and is in rehab, I had to take over the care of my other 3 grandparents, my sister had emergency gall bladder surgery&nbsp;and my wife gave birth to our second child who is the reason I am so sleep deprived.  In short, life happened to me.&nbsp; I am not any more special than anyone else, but I am willing to say that I am probably mentally tougher than many. Mental toughness is nothing more than a state of mind, cliche but true. I don't quit because my family needs me, they will not let me and I will not let them down either.  For anyone who knows me or follows my writing this is probably a repetitive bore, too bad.&nbsp;I am the master of this keyboard and it is what I felt like typing. If you don't like it you can forget you read it. But that would be kind of rude, why read all that only to ignore what you have read. My, my, my, I cannot think of anything more rude. I shall have to take you to task.  Ok, enough rambling the freaking soapbox has splintered and I don't have the time to fix it. Smile for the camera, you might as well enjoy being here.

      At what point do you decide to tell people that they are being exploited even if they claim not to be. Or should we ask under what conditions can you be exploited? What role in the "exploitation" do you have to have to be exploited?  Whatever, I am a reality TV junkie, but even I consider this to be exploitative of the Amish. Green Acres meets The Odd Couple meets My Favorite Martian meets The 5 intelligent people of Cleveland.

      I haven't slept for more than a few hours for the last few nights. All of this consecutive lack of sleep is starting to wear me down. I am not even sure if I am making sense, but this comes with the territory. I don't require a ton of sleep, but I don't mind it either.   At the moment they are working in my office to try and fix a squeaky door, so all of the hammering and pounding is doing what caffeine cannot, but for how long I cannot say. More importantly I hate loud noises like this or the vacuum cleaner so it is not real relaxing and definitely not conducive to getting work done.   At 20 this would have been a breeze, but at the grand old age of 102 it is getting a little bit tougher. I told my daughter last night that if she would promise to sleep for a couple of hours I would give her a present. She gurgled at me and then resumed flailing around. Not even a week old and she is already talking back to me. A defiant attitude must be genetic.

      There is no accounting for taste. What a sad statement. We allow this conman to steal money and profit from the sorrow of others. If you had the same resources and time you could twist and distort the truth about anyone.  He is guilty of the same crimes he accuses the admin of. Shame on you Michael Moore, have you no decency.

      Today we are going to bring home my little girl. At the ripe old age of 3.5 my son is aware that his world is changing and a little anxious about what those changes may be. I told him that it would be ok and tried to reassure him, but I am not having a lot of success.  In any case my 3 younger sisters survived me and I am sure that little Jack will not do anything to his sister. And now I am off to do more prep work for bringing the girls back home.

      Today is the first full day of my daughter's life, pretty strange. No, not strange, surreal. We went to the hospital yesterday to be induced. Got there at 10 am and didn't deliver until 11:38 PM.  She is a big girl, not as big as daddy, I was closer to 10 pounds, but I know one person who is very happy she is smaller. It was a very long day, as the father it is hard to wait all day because there is not a whole heck of a lot that you can do. And I am not one to sit still.  Following the delivery it took until just short of 3 am to get the girls into their room. At one point I had intended to spend the night with them, but there was a mini baby boom and there wasn't any room for me. And just like that another woman had thrown me out on the street.   ;).     &nbsp; So I drove home and relieved my inlaws of their babysitting chores and pittered around the house until 4 am at which time I called my mom and spoke to her (she is in NJ with my sis) for about 15 minutes and then managed to fall asleep.  Finally got up about 9 and spent more time puttering around while I watched my son sleep. They are so peaceful. Eventually got us together, made breakfast and then left for the hospital. Arrived there at noon and stayed until 7:30 and then returned home to resume babysitting detail. And now at 9:40 or so I am trying to decide what I want to eat for dinner as well as determine what chores have to be completed prior to the entrance of the her majesty tomorrow morning.

      I spoke with my father this morning. It was less than 24 hours after his triple bypass. Just amazing that he did so well, not to mention how happy it made me to hear his voice. The surgeon who performed the surgery does about 300 of these a year and is very accomplished.  But&nbsp; you still end up worrying about loved ones no matter what. In any case this is done and now I can focus solely upon the things in front of me. What a relief.

      Well, it is time to play with more of the new features of this Blog. Yesterday my father had an angiogram&nbsp; ( urlLink http://www.mayoclinic.org/heartcatheterization-jax ). It was supposed to be just a simple formality so that he could be assured that there are not any additional issues with his heart. &nbsp; It was July 16th, my parents 37th wedding anniversary and exactly one day short of completing a full 90 days in New Jersey, much longer than the 2 weeks they had intended to stay. &nbsp; So&nbsp;as an anniversary gift my dad is going to receive a bypass and my mother get's to hang out in NJ for another 6 weeks or so. It could be less,&nbsp; but it could be more.  &nbsp; In the interim the babywatch continues. Any day&nbsp;now, any time and I'll witness the birth of another child. And while this goes on I still have to&nbsp;worry about my parents and my grandparents. I&nbsp;am feeling like a very old 35. Of&nbsp;course if you were to see me with&nbsp;my son you might think that&nbsp;I am the biggest 5 year-old you have ever seen. &nbsp; It is just so much fun to play with him.&nbsp;

      Wow. I was prepared to write about  details  and then I see that the boys from Blogger have given me some new   tools to play with.    How very cool.  It is appropriate because   today I was   thinking about why it is that some people are more successful than others and came to a conclusion.     &nbsp;    It is better to be lucky than skilled.    It is better to be skilled than unskilled and unlucky    But the best thing you could ask for is to be skilled and lucky.     That being said one of the key things you can do in life is work hard and pay attention to the little details. I don't like dealing with all of the details, I find it tedious and boring, but I know from experience that they make a difference. Many people just ignore them through ignorance or laziness, maybe both.    But the reality is that those little touches are noticed. You cannot guarantee that they will be each and every time, but it is a good habit to get into. In other words cutting corners can cut your profit. I'll let you decide what that profit may be. In my business it equals dollars, moolah, cold hard cash.    Those extra minutes distinguish me from my competition. It is something that I want my children to take with them, do the little things. At least try to do them as often as possible. I really do dislike it, but I have to admit that they are the reason that I have been successful at closing numerous deals.   Which leads me to another point as I beat this horse to death. So many times in a sales situation you have competitors whose product is equally good to what you are offering. There is no shame in that, the only shame is if you cannot provide demonstrative value to the customer. Those little details are difference makers. Not profound, but useful information.

      The wife is getting tired of being pregnant. We're less than two weeks away from D-Day and she is ready to "pop this baby out." Of course, now that is hitting 100+ I can understand it.  So tonight she sent me to Caioti for the salad   Caioti Pizza Cafe is widely known for a salad that has become legendary and a rite of passage for expectant or overdue Moms. To check out more articles and reviews on Caioti Cafe, please click on -People Are Talking- to the right. To find out more about the Famous Salad, please visit our other website www.maternitysalad.com  http://www.caiotipizzacafe.com/pages/1/index.htm  So I picked up dinner and brought it back and now we wait and see what happens. I am really tired and I have a ton of work at the office. I am hopeful that we can get through the week. Friday night is a-ok with me. But whenever the baby comes will be good.  Anyway, we decided that tonight would be a good time to put the second car seat in our CRV. We need to see how it fits and get our older son used to the idea of sharing the car. It was about 8 or so when we started and it was just beginning to get dark. The first time we squeezed them in we tried to stick the baby's seat in the middle and the other on the passenger side.  Only one problem, they didn't fit. So then we tried moving one behind the driver and one behind the passenger. It fit, but we decided that we needed to switch our older child's seat into the driver's side, so we started over and wrestled them into place.  Meanwhile we have this 3.5 year old climbing through the car barking out orders and honking the horn. It was all age appropriate behavior, but it made it tough to make things happen, especially as he kept trying to sit in his seat so that we could go for a ride.  To make a long story longer there in the twilight we eventually got both seats into place and were ready to come back in when we decided to just try it out. Lo and behold we found out that his seat is not locking properly. And now our Britax Roundabout is going to be taken back to the Right Start so that they can explain why a two year old seat suddenly broke.  I need this like a hole in the head, but hey, it could be worse. Life is full of funny stories.

      Life is funny in so many ways. For a relatively short period of time things had dramatically slowed down at the office. In large part because so many of my prospects and customers left for Summer vacations. It was nice to slow down a bit, but it is also frustrating.  As a salesperson it is hard not to get edgy when things are slow, because it probably means that the money is not going to come in the volume you want it to. Truth be told I never allow myself to feel comfortable because complacency in sales leads to bad things.  Now with the advent of the newest child around the corner I am engaged in a curious juxtaposition of events. Work has gotten pretty busy. It does tend to come in waves, but this is much larger and more intense than other times. Simultaneously I am finding it harder to concentrate as I cannot help but be excited about the impending arrival of the baby. What makes it so challenging is that I haven't any solid idea about when the baby will arrive, just some vague idea of when. That kind of stuff just makes me crazy.  Not that I am not crazy to begin with, I am. But this is a special kind of crazy. Such a huge change in life is just, well for lack of a better word, huge.  So the challenge for me is to try and bear down and do my work as well as I possibly can and hope that I don't have to leave any deals hanging when the baby comes. Family comes first, but it still helps to have those deals come in so that you can feed the family.

       He is so dead on.    By Sam Smith Special to ESPN.com   No, the grass isn't greener on the other side of the fence. Sorry, Shaq and Kobe. You've just both made a mistake you'll regret for the rest of your lives. At least if we're to believe, as you guys always say, you're about winning. No two men, perhaps since Caesar and Brutus, could have accomplished more by staying together and remaining working partners. Though perhaps it is inevitable that dynasties end and that jealousies and rivalries and ego, greed and ambition are fated forces that are too much for the human mind and soul to combat. What is happiness? These questions are best answered by philosophers like Thoreau, Plato, Confuscius, Spinoza, Kierkegaard and Phil Jackson. If happiness is winning a championship and being part of a great team, then Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant have committed blunders for the ages. Perhaps O'Neal will win a championship if he goes to the Miami Heat, as expected. But are the chances better if he were playing with Bryant? Sure, Dwyane Wade looks like he'll become a heck of a player. But I haven't heard comparisons to Bryant quite yet. Even O'Neal would admit he's not quite whhe was. Sure, there were extenuating circumstances this past season. There was Karl Malone and Gary Payton, who needed more shots than the retinue of role players who'd teamed with O'Neal and Bryant through three consecutive NBA championships. So O'Neal's scoring average hit a career low. He was very good in the playoffs, but not nearly as great as he'd been. He is no longer the kind of player to load a team on his back and carry it wherever he wants it to go.   Donnie Walsh, the talented longtime director of the Indiana Pacers, always used to laugh when people asked him to explain why the Western Conference was better than the Eastern Conference. Walsh said the West was better because it had the best player, O'Neal, and probably had the second best player in Bryant. Take them away and that, really, was the difference. Now the defending champion and the most dominant player are in the East. Will the NBA be asked to reseed the playoffs so a Western Conference team has a chance to win a championship? Just kidding. But that scale just tipped way back to the East, and not just because O'Neal and his little weight problems are going to be sitting on the Eastern side of it.   It's always easy to dismiss losers.      Shaquille O'Neal, left, and Kobe Bryant will find out how tough it is to win a title on your own.  The Lakers lost to the Pistons in the NBA Finals, but they were not losers.   Even though it was a 4-1 margin, this was not only a Lakers team that went through what was then considered easily the better conference, but which went into the Finals with its power forward, effectively, unable to play and its backup guard and top sixth man also limited. Add to that the intrigue of the inevitable splintering, and it's easy to see why the Lakers lost. But they weren't far away from winning, and a healthy, more cooperative team would be the favorite against the East's best, no matter who it is.   Jackson had seen this coming almost from the beginning. Yes, Phil could see the future on occasion, too.   Not that this one wasn't hard to divine.   Jackson had gone through the "It's my team. No, it's my team. No, it's my team. No, it's MY team" thing with Bryant and O'Neal during the 2000-01 season and resolved it pretty well. At least they did in putting together a historic 15-1 run through the playoffs. It was Shaq's time and he was winning his second of three straight Finals MVPs. Jackson knew it was Shaq's time, but he also knew time always won, especially with the big guys. After he was 30, Wilt never averaged 30 points again and only was above 25 one season. After hitting 30, Bill Russell never again averaged more than 15 rebounds. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar played a dozen more seasons after hitting 30 and averaged at least 25 points just twice.   Jackson knew it would be coming for O'Neal, and he began to talk to him about eventually turning it over to Kobe, doing, in effect, what Abdul-Jabbar did with Magic Johnson. Not that it was so voluntary, warm and fuzzy with Abdul-Jabbar. He resented Magic, but he also understood. He had a chance to still win and prolong his career if he let his pride and ego -- and there never was one any bigger -- go a little and allow Magic to step into the spotlight. Abdul-Jabbar won his last league MVP award in 1980. But he was on four championship teams after that. Kareem didn't like Magic being the star, but he understood.   Shaq and Kobe just don't get it.     Look, when O'Neal and Bryant were blasting away at one another at the beginning of last season, both were right. Shaq is lazy about practice and overweight and doesn't care all the time. Bryant is selfish and self-centered and condescending toward his teammates. So what. That doesn't describe half the rest of the NBA? Or most of corporate America?   People are about themselves. That's what great leadership is for -- to get them to work together toward a common goal. It's what separated Jackson from his peers. Well, that and the Native American paraphernalia and Zen garden in his living room, as well. But that's another story.   News flash! Players generally can't stand one another. This is not unique to Bryant and O'Neal. It goes on everywhere in every sport. What, like you're hugging your co-workers? Most people can't get away from them fast enough. Good friends don't make winning teams. Great talent does.   That's why the Lakers won. They had the best interior player in the game in O'Neal and the best perimeter player in the game in Bryant. There never has been a combination like that in the history of the NBA. Perhaps Magic and Kareem. But Kareem wasn't quite that dominant as Johnson matured, and Magic never was the best offensive force in the game. Not Russell and Bob Cousy. Not Wilt and any of his teammates. When he had Jerry West, Wilt was no longer the offensive force, no longer even among the top 10 scorers in the game. Mikan and Slater Martin?   And this was far from over. But like the clip from "Animal House" played in most arenas these days late in games, they did say when it was over.    Here are two guys who need one another and had so much going for each other. They were the perfect basketball complement, the ultimate Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside ... It's hard to fathom either equaling the success they shared.     Sure, Jerry Buss will get the blame, and sure he got tired of Shaq's money demands and injury vacations, but Shaq and Kobe broke this up.   No, they couldn't just get along, Rodney.   It's hard to even come up with anything like this, when pettiness and vainglory transcend success.   Perhaps the most recent example was Stephon Marbury's petulant exit from Minnesota. Though that was a "what could have been." Marbury and Kevin Garnett hadn't done anything together yet.   But the Lakers are done now. Not forever, because Bryant is that good -- good enough to carry a team from the backcourt to a championship. Michael Jordan did it. So did Isiah Thomas, though it took a long time and many, many moves. At 25, and assuming he is able to play after the trial, Bryant has time.   The Heat will be much closer now. But for how long? O'Neal is 32, and he'll have to do much more now with Miami's team stripped down to accommodate the trade. It may take a few years to build it back up and add the pieces to complement O'Neal. But then will he be able to do enough? Will Wade even become Magic as O'Neal becomes Kareem?   Here are two guys who need one another and had so much going for each other. They were the perfect basketball complement, the ultimate Mr. Inside and Mr. Outside, the ideal guys to pass the baton and keep ahead of the field. Now both are back in the pack trying to poke their heads out front again. It's going to be difficult, not impossible, but it's hard to fathom either equaling the success they shared.   What a huge mistake they've both made by not only allowing it to happen, but ensuring that is has.

      Why Israel Needs a Fence By BENJAMIN NETANYAHU  Published: July 13, 2004   JERUSALEM — While the advisory finding by the International Court of Justice last week that Israel's barrier in the West Bank is illegal may be cheered by the terrorists who would kill Israeli civilians, it does not change the fact that none of the arguments against the security fence have any merit.          First, Israel is not building the fence on territory that under international law can be properly called "Palestinian land." The fence is being built in disputed territories that Israel won in a defensive war in 1967 from a Jordanian occupation that was never recognized by the international community. Israel and the Palestinians both claim ownership of this land. According to Security Council Resolution 242, this dispute is to be resolved by a negotiated peace that provides Israel with secure and recognized boundaries.   Second, the fence is not a permanent political border but a temporary security barrier. A fence can always be moved. Recently, Israel removed 12 miles of the fence to ease Palestinian daily life. And last month, Israel's Supreme Court ordered the government to reroute 20 more miles of the fence for that same purpose. In fact, the indefensible line on which many have argued the fence should run — that which existed between Israel and the Arab lands before the 1967 war — is the only line that would have nothing to do with security and everything to do with politics. A line that is genuinely based on security would include as many Jews as possible and as few Palestinians as possible within the fence.  That is precisely what Israel's security fence does. By running into less than 12 percent of the West Bank, the fence will include about 80 percent of Jews and only 1 percent of Palestinians who live within the disputed territories. The fence thus will block attempts by terrorists based in Palestinian cities to reach major Israeli population centers.     Third, despite what some have argued, fences have proven highly effective against terrorism. Of the hundreds of suicide bombings that have taken place in Israel, only one has originated from the Gaza area, where Hamas and Islamic Jihad are headquartered. Why? Because Gaza is surrounded by a security fence. Even though it is not complete, the West Bank security fence has already drastically reduced the number of suicide attacks.  The obstacle to peace is not the fence but Palestinian leaders who, unlike past leaders like Anwar Sadat of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan, have yet to abandon terrorism and the illegitimate goal of destroying Israel. Should Israel reach a compromise with a future Palestinian leadership committed to peace that requires adjustments to the fence, those changes will be made. And if that peace proves genuine and lasting, there will be no reason for a fence at all.  Instead of placing Palestinian terrorists and those who send them on trial, the United Nations-sponsored international court placed the Jewish state in the dock, on the charge that Israel is harming the Palestinians' quality of life. But saving lives is more important than preserving the quality of life. Quality of life is always amenable to improvement. Death is permanent. The Palestinians complain that their children are late to school because of the fence. But too many of our children never get to school — they are blown to pieces by terrorists who pass into Israel where there is still no fence.  In the last four years, Palestinian terrorists have attacked Israel's buses, cafes, discos and pizza shops, murdering 1,000 of our citizens. Despite this unprecedented savagery, the court's 60-page opinion mentions terrorism only twice, and only in citations of Israel's own position on the fence. Because the court's decision makes a mockery of Israel's right to defend itself, the government of Israel will ignore it. Israel will never sacrifice Jewish life on the debased altar of "international justice."    Benjamin Netanyahu is Israel's finance minister and a former prime minister.

There is an attachment, a bond that is not unlike that of child and parent.  I am heartbroken and left diminished outside of her walls. In time I will return to drink deeply in the sights and sounds of my city. There is no other place that I can think of that has this kind of impact upon so many. G-d's touch is upon the stones.

      The loyal readership has reached out to me and spoken. Ok, the very few who read this and remark have made comments upon how often I update this Blog. There is a feeling that I could be doing more and doing it faster.  The answer is I could. I can be quite prolific and I could write more, but the question is why should I do this. I write because I enjoy it and I need to continue to practice so that I can hopefully keep it at a higher level.  I don't feel the need to produce copious amounts of material because I find it kind of dull and cannot imagine that anyone else would find it to be exceptionally stimulating. Not to mention that I also post on a couple of message boards which probably explains some of why I do not always have much to say.  Listen to the silence around you and you will learn many things. Seriously. It is a good skill to have, to be comfortable with silence.

      And for a post of a less serious nature I bring you my short rant about Jerry Buss. Old Doc Buss used to be the finest example of an owner in sports. He ran a first class organization in which he brought in the finest staff he could find and let them run the show.  Too many times we see owners get involved in something that they do not know much about. I know that they are the owners and that it is their money, blah, blah, blah stuff. But the reality is that none of us are experts in everything and sometimes the best that we can do is to hire a great team and let them do what they do best. And that often means you must get out of the way.  And now Old Doc Buss has forgotten that lesson. He chased away a coach that brought him 3 titles in five years and has so incensed the most dominant player in the league that he is demanding a trade. I am not interested in discussing egos or why Shaq/Kobe should shut up and play. This is not that different from the real world in that we see management do stupid things like this there too. Egos abound and sometimes your ego as the boss/owner can wreak havoc.  In this case even though Shaq is not the player he was, you will never find equal value for him. He is a key reason for the 3 championships and his presence means that the team will remain competitive. Why break this up early and risk losing seasons when you do not need to do it.  It is a sad time for Laker fans. Fox did this to the Dodgers when they traded Mike Piazza. And now it is 16 years since they last won a world series and almost a decade since they made the playoffs.

      As the baby countdown continues I have found that my weekends are getting busier. There are more "little tasks" that need to be taken care of. I have two toilets to fix, one here and one at my folks house. More reorganization of furniture and closets so that the new child has a pleasant place to to come home to. More cleaning of toys and paraphenalia that have been locked up since my son was little. Oy.  All I want is about a week to lie on a beach and just be. I haven't been back to Maui in 8 years, but I am ready to step on a plane today.

      April 28, 2004 will be a day that we will not forget, but it was really only the beginning.  It has been a long and twisting road waiting for my abba's health to improve. There have been a number of rough spots during which we questioned whether he would come home standing or otherwise.  As of today's tests we learned that his heart attack appears not to have been major and the damage hit a less important section of the heart.  It was the endocardium of a lower section, or so it was passed on to me.     The graphic is nice, but it is not detailed enough to show the interior section that was hit. Back in my days as a CPR instructor I used to lecture about the heart, but that is not all that relevant for this discussion, just a nugget about me for the viewing public.  So now we have determined the need for an angiogram. It is not a question, just a question of when. The hard part is trying to determine whether it is better to continue things in New Jersey or to try and do this here in L.A. Once they go in there are a number of possibilities, but we do not expect anything serious.   My abba is not interested in going back in, and who can blame him. He spent about 60 days living in a hospital, but he has no choice. If I need to pick him up and throw him in the car he will go.  In the meantime the babycountdown continues. This plays it's own role as there is a real incentive for the grandparents to get back to LA for the birth of the 5th grandchild. But I will not stand for rushing my dad's healthcare just for this. My child needs a grandfather who will be here for the long run, if they miss the birth, they miss it. I don't care as long as my abba's health is not adversely impacted by this.

       The baby is coming, the baby is coming  Where is Paul Revere when I need him. It is July 7 and in a matter of weeks I will become a father for the second time. We have the names narrowed down, more or less. It seems like we are really close to selecting one for a girl and one for a boy.   So, you the loyal readers are probably wondering what those names will be. Get used to disappointment. I share much of myself and my thoughts, but the familia is my business. I am a nasty, angry over protective cuss when it comes to them. Ok, I am regardless of their involvement, but I get more ornery when they are in the picture. So I am not saying a thing.  It is so interesting, just so wacky, I am going to be someone else's daddy. My son said to me "Abba, you are my daddy, no one elses." I looked at him, smiled and explained that he would share me, but that he would share me with someone who would be very special to him. He can't wait to be a big brother.  And what a wild year it has been, Jerry was right. What a long strange trip it has been. I have so many memories and so many stories that I could share, but I am ready for things to settle down. I am not sure that I was cut out to sail such turbulent seas with so much responsibility, or maybe I am. I am not quite sure. I try to make a game of it and say, is this the best that you have got. Show me more, bring your best and I'll eat it alive. It is like playing hearts and shooting for the moon, I do it all the time. Big gamble, big reward.

      I am a jack-of-many trades. I cannot say all, but I have worked in many different positions at a variety of companies. I have enjoyed the diversity and learning about different things.  My experience includes, writing, sales (both inside and outside, teaching, youth work, camp counselor, marketing and mischief. Some of the products I have sold include advertising (print and online, diamond tools for cutting concrete, floor covering, copiers, sunglasses and trips to different places.  One of the things that I have learned through all of this is not to be dumb enough to think that I know about every business/publication or thing that I need to know. There are many people who are smarter, better educated and older who share not knowing everything with me. I will not embarass them or myself by claiming otherwise.  In my current incarnation I sell advertising. Today while speaking with a prospect he told me that he had never heard of us, hence we must not be that big and are probably lying. I explained to him politely that he was misinformed and pointed out a couple of things that he didn't know that disproved his initial thoughts.  In a short time he realized that he was wrong and got to be a pest. He became a pest because his ego got him in trouble when he made his initial statement about not knowing who we were. I didn't tell him that he was stupid. I pointed out to him that his news comes from us, even if he didn't realize it and showed him how.  Sometimes your own ego can get you into trouble. In this case it made him look and feel stupid, which probably means that because he was the idiot I am not going to get the sale. Nothing like losing it because the prospect was stupid. I far prefer my own stupidity, because I can work on that.

      Isn't it interesting to see how some people cannot help but allow their distaste for certain people to color their view of some situations.  I can understand why you might find it difficult to like some people.  I can understand why you might not want to be involved in things that other people are involved in. But I just have a hard time grasping how you can let your personal bias prevent you from making a logical assessment of political/historical situations.  More to the point, I find it funny to hear people claim to be knowledgeable and educated about specific events when through the course of discussion it becomes clear that they are just not. If you are that ignorant, why would you continue to broadcast it.

       urlLink  : "The world is sustained by three things: By justice, by truth, and by peace.  �Rabban Shimon ben Gamliel"  There are some very interesting discussions that can be had when discussing this quote. Honesty is something that is often in short supply, yet we should remember that even when we are what some people call "brutally honest" we are not always being honest. Sounds like a contradiction, but here is what I mean.  Some people promote themselves as being purveyors of peace. They work as arbiters, social workers or could just be friendly ambassadors who enjoy trying to resolve disputes. The issue is that when you try and solve disputes it is not always possible to do so when you are so honest that you do not hold back. Some people cannot handle that kind of honesty and even though what you may say is true they may choose to continue to fight.  Example: Two boxers engage in a 12 round battle. The fight ends and one is declared the winner. The judges describe the winner as having "destroyed" the other. Consequently the loser's ego is so seriously bruised that he attacks the winner and is subjected to another beating. That may sound simplistic, but consider how our own egos can cause us to act in ways that are not smart nor beneficial to our own well being. Sometimes it is better to be more diplomatic in our descriptions of "truth."

      Hollywood fantasy? Tidal wave disaster is just waiting to happen Scientist says governments are ignoring threat of a piece of rock as big as the Isle of Man crashing into the Atlantic Ian Sample, science correspondentTuesday August 10, 2004 urlLink The Guardian  It has everything you could wish for in a cliche-ridden disaster movie. A beautiful volcanic island in the Atlantic is on the brink of catastrophic collapse, threatening to unleash giant waves that will wreak havoc around the globe within hours. And while scientists try in vain to make their concerns heard, the world's governments look the other way.  But yesterday a leading expert claimed the doom-laden scenario was not only real but was being almost completely ignored by people in power. Bill McGuire, the director of the Benfield Grieg Hazard Research Centre at University College London, said a huge chunk of rock, roughly the size of the Isle of Man, was on the brink of breaking off the volcanic island of La Palma in the Canaries.  When - Professor McGuire says it is not a matter of if - the rock plunges into the ocean it will trigger giant waves called mega-tsunamis. Travelling at speeds of up to 560mph, the huge walls of water will tear across the ocean and hit islands and continents, leaving a trail of destruction. Mega-tsunami waves are much longer than the ones we are used to. "When one of these comes in, it keeps on coming for 10 to 15 minutes," Prof McGuire said. "It's like a huge wall of water that just keeps coming."  Computer models of the island's collapse show the first regions to be hit, with waves topping 100 metres (330ft), will be the neighbouring Canary Islands. Within a few hours the west coast of Africa will be battered with similar-sized waves.  Between nine and 12 hours after the island collapses, waves between 20 and 50 metres high will have crossed 4,000 miles of ocean to crash into the Caribbean islands and the eastern seaboard of the US and Canada.  The worst-hit will be harbours and estuaries, which will channel the waves inland. The loss of life and destruction to property will probably be immense, according to Prof McGuire. Britain would not escape entirely, he added. Waves of around 10 metres are likely to strike the south coast four to five hours after the island collapses, causing damage to seaside resorts and ports.  Such devastating natural disasters are rare, occurring on average every 10,000 years. But La Palma could collapse much sooner than that. "The thing about La Palma is we know it's on the move now," Prof McGuire said.  The island came to the attention of scientists in 1949 when its volcano, Cumbre Vieja, erupted, causing a huge chunk of its western flank to drop four metres into the ocean. Scientists believe the chunk of land is still slipping slowly into the water, and say another eruption is likely to make the entire western flank collapse. "When it goes, it will likely collapse in around 90 seconds," Prof McGuire said.  Precarious Despite the potential scale of the threat, little is being done to monitor the geological activity of La Palma. Only a few seismometers have been set up on the precarious western flank of the island, which do not provide enough information to predict when another eruption might occur. "It's really a worrying situation," Prof McGuire said. "It will almost certainly go during an eruption. The problem is that with just a few seismometers on the island, we may not get the notice we need."  The scientist called for an international effort to install more sophisticated sensors on the island, as well as global positioning satellite units to detect how quickly the land mass was falling into the ocean. "We need to have better monitoring so we know when an eruption is about to happen," he said. Such a system could cost as little as a few hundred thousand dollars.  "The US government must be aware of the La Palma threat. They should certainly be worried, and so should the island states in the Caribbean that will really bear the brunt of a collapse. "They're not taking it seriously. Governments change every four to five years and generally they're not interested in these things."  Even with new monitoring equipment in place, La Palma presents a difficult problem for those charged with mitigating against natural disasters. Little can be done to protect against the waves produced when La Palma collapses. Barriers would not be able to sustain the battering, and breaking the island apart before it collapses is either too dangerous or time-consuming.  New sensors could warn of an impending eruption two weeks in advance. But no one knows whether the island will collapse during the next eruption, or in an eruption that will not happen for centuries.  Ordering mass evacuations would have a huge financial impact that could cause resentment if it turned out to be a false alarm. The disaster could affect up to 100 million people from the coast of Africa to the Canary islands and the east coast of North America.  "The future president of the US has got to make a call at some point, that when La Palma erupts, what is he going to do?" Prof McGuire said.  "Is he going to evacuate all the major cities on the east coast? If he gets it wrong, nobody's ever going to pay attention again and he'll be out of a job."

         I thought that this article was very interesting. Here are a couple of selections.           There can be little doubt that Al Qaeda is trying to strike the American homeland before Nov. 2. "We are in the midst of Al Qaeda efforts to attack the U.S. on a scale as big or larger than 9/11," says John Brennan, chief of the Terrorist Threat Integration Center, the interagency operation that consolidates threat information (and produces the Putter). The decision to raise the threat level to Code Orange ("high") last week was not, as partisans and conspiracists suggested, a Republican political stunt intended to slow John Kerry as he came out of the Democratic convention. But the announcement was clumsily handled, and the confusing press accounts that followed mostly obscured a larger and more important story.  The uncomfortable truth is that a frantic, multibillion-dollar, global intelligence effort has not been able to answer—definitively, at any rate—the scariest and most basic question: are there Qaeda operatives inside the United States? "We have to assume there are," says Townsend. "But we don't know. The reports are mixed." Certainly, at least a few Qaeda operatives have entered America at some point since 9/11. The FBI is hotly investigating whether Khan was one of them. And Khan's arrest has already led to the detention of some major Qaeda operatives in England and Pakistan, and will flush out still more in days to come.     There are no surprises in any of this. What really is scary is how much we really do not know.           A British intelligence source, speaking on background to NEWSWEEK, was indignant that Americans blew a chance to secretly watch al-Hindi while he continued to move around and make contact with other Qaeda operatives. An old intel rule is "Let the plot run." Historically, the British have been astonishingly patient, even coldblooded, about not revealing their sources. During World War II, British intelligence allowed U-boat wolf packs to attack convoys rather than prematurely reveal that the Allies had broken the German codes.     There are many people who are convinced that a lack of successful attacks means that AQ has stopped trying. I never believed that and I think that this story and others provide ample support, as well as support that our efforts have at least slowed AQ down and prevented some attacks. But the issue in so many ways is not how long we can keep this up, but how we can root out the cancer and kill it so that these types of stories disappear.              Sadly, I am not real optimistic, I think that there will likely always be some kind of enemy, but you have to dream big or you never really succeed.

News - Accuser Files Civil Suit Against Bryant"DENVER - The 20-year-old woman accusing Kobe Bryant of rape filed a federal lawsuit against the NBA star Tuesday, seeking unspecified damages for pain, suffering and 'public scorn, hatred and ridicule' she has suffered as a result of the alleged attack. "    Based upon what I have read and heard this appears to me to be a complete sham and a travesty of justice. That is, I have severe doubts that there was anything but consensual sex there. Kobe is guilty of adultery or so it appears. In the end the only two people who know for certain are the two parties.  But this case has stunk for a long time. The DA jumped ship and is no longer the one prosecuting the case. It certainly gives the appearance that he left because he didn't think that he could win.  As for the accusers claims of public scorn and suffering I would say that Kobe could say the same thing. He has been tarred with a a broad brush and subjected to the same things that she claims she is suffering from. If he is really guilty you could argue that this is appropriate, but if he is not then he has unnecessarily been subjected to a horrific experience at the hands of a woman who is universally known to be mentally unstable.  Who knows what really happened, but it certainly is a lesson for others to learn from. Sad, sad, sad.

      "They stabbed him repeatedly, cut off the man's ears, pulled out his tongue and ate it," Garraez told Reuters by telephone. He was quoting a sworn statement by a witness, who said he had been forced to eat some flesh taken from the victim's arms.    I cannot say that this would be my first choice, but I do imagine it would make it a little bit harder for her to get a date.

      Yahoo! the First Winner in Google IPO  urlLink   By Tom Taulli August 10, 2004 In early July, I wrote a  urlLink piece  for The Motley Fool in which I talked about how competitors use guerrilla-war tactics during the pre-IPO phase, such as when Barnes & Noble  (NYSE: BKS)  launched a lawsuit right before Amazon.com's  (Nasdaq: AMZN)  IPO. I concluded that Yahoo!  (Nasdaq: YHOO)  might "rattle" its saber with its patent fight with Google.  You see, one of Yahoo's smartest acquisitions was Overture, which has patented technology for advertising based on Web searches.  Well, Yahoo! took a stab at Google and reached a  urlLink settlement  yesterday. Yahoo! will get 2.7 million shares of Google, which amounts to $291 million to $365 million based on the price range of $108 to $135. Yahoo!, in turn, will blow out 1.1 million of its shares in the IPO. Currently, Yahoo! owns 6.6 million shares of Google. Google was smart in reaching the settlement. The company avoided a surprise attack from Yahoo! and also cleared up uncertainty regarding the business model. Just imagine if a federal court ruled that Google had no right to use its auction system, which accounts for much of its revenues.  For Yahoo!, the company was clearly in a position of strength and was not shy in exacting a great deal. After all, business-method patents can often be difficult to enforce. For example, the lawsuit between Yahoo! and Google had lasted two years already.  However, in the brutally competitive war for search, Google may still be sandbagged by its competitors on the eve of its expected IPO. For instance, is Microsoft  (Nasdaq: MSFT)  cooking up a big announcement? In the wacky Google IPO process, anything seems possible.  Fool contributor  urlLink Tom Taulli  is the author of  urlLink The EDGAR Online Guide to Decoding Financial Statements . He does not own shares in any of the stocks mentioned.             This makes me happy. I purchased a modest amount of Yahoo! in 2000. At the time I thought that I was getting in near the bottom and found out that I was quite wrong. The stock took about an 80% hit after I purchased it and it plummeted. It dropped so fast and so far there was no point to consider a short sale, but I really didn't want to do that either.          My hope was that the Net and Yahoo1 would prove the naysayers wrong. And I am pleased to see that it did. I think that Yahoo! managed to survive because they had the advantage of first mover status followed up by smart leadership. First mover helped to build the brand, but the smart leadership saved the company. They could have easily gone the other direction.          And now my shares have split a couple of times and their value has increased. A little luck never hurts.

       urlLink Study finds jobs affect Alzheimer's - 08/10/04 : "Study finds jobs affect Alzheimer's Workers with mentally demanding careers will less likely get disease By Lee Bowman / Scripps Howard News Service Study finds jobs affect Alzheimer's  A study finds that those with Alzheimer’s are more likely to have had less mentally demanding careers than people the same age who did not develop the degenerative brain disease.  Researchers at the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine examined 122 people with Alzheimer’s and 235 people free of the disease, all over age 60. They interviewed those who were disease-free about their job history from their 20s through their 50s, and got the same information from family members of those with the affliction.  Scientists collected information on the type of job and industry, the length of time on the job and the subjects’ most important activities. Mental, physical, social and fine motor skills required of the job were scored using scales developed by the U.S. Department of Labor.  Writing in the journal Neurology, researchers reported today that, over several decades, people with Alzheimer’s had held jobs with lower mental demands than those in the control group.  During the subjects’ 20s, mental demands of the job were about the same for both groups. But those who were free of Alzheimer’s moved on to jobs with greater mental demands when they were in their 30s, 40s and 50s, increasing the demand level by about 33 percent on average across the decades. However, the mental demands for those with Alzheimer’s remained at about the same level later in their working lives.  The researchers also found that those who developed Alzheimer’s had jobs with more physical demands than those in the control group, but there were no differences in the social or motor skills required.  Because education has been found to help protect against Alzheimer’s, the researchers also reshuffled their results while controlling for educational levels. Still, they found that the results didn’t change.  The study wasn’t able to suggest why a more mentally demanding job would affect later risk, but lead author Kathleen Smyth said several theories have been offered.  “It could be that the disease has a very early effect on the individual’s capacity to pursue a mentally challenging occupation,” Smyth said. “Or it could be that higher levels of mental demands result in increased brain cell activity, which may help maintain a ‘reserve’ of brain cells that resist the effects of Alzheimer’s.”  She added that “there’s also the possibility that jobs with higher mental demands require skills that enhance a person’s ability to perform well on tests used to diagnose Alzheimer’s. If this is the case, then the disease may go undetected in these people until the disease is much farther along than in those whose jobs pose lower mental demands.”  Smyth noted that although the team did consider education, it did not factor in the subject’s social or economic status. Having higher social status and more money generally gives people an advantage in health care and nutrition.  The study also didn’t consider the environmental demands or exposures of the different occupations and their possible contribution to later onset of Alzheimer’s, she said.

       urlLink The yada, yada, yada blog : "Brit's mystical wedding: As we reported to you back in June, Britney Spears hired a Jewish wedding planner to help her with her November nuptials to Kevin Federline. Now comes word that Britney may want to say 'I do' under a chupah and have a Kabbalah-themed ceremony. 'There's some resistance from her family, who are devout Baptists,' says a source. 'But maybe there's a way to incorporate elements from both faiths, and make everyone happy.' Yes, maybe there's a way to wrap a red string arond Jesus' wrist. "  Tel Aviv ... romantic setting for wedding?: Riding the Kabbalah wedding bandwagon, reports came out of Israel this week that Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher would wed in a Kabbalah ceremony in Tel Aviv next month. The couple reportedly will be in the Holy Land as part of Madonna's Rosh Hashanah trip to Israel.  Oy vey: The UK's Sun newspaper is reporting that Kabbalah enthusiast Madonna has taken up singing in Yiddish. According to the paper, Madge performed two Yiddish songs in front of about 50 guests at the home of her rabbi, Phillip Berg, while in New York recently. What's "like a virgin" in Yiddish?    Some people will call this sour grapes, but I have a problem with these bandwagon nudniks who take bits and pieces of belief and string them together because it fits their current belief set. I have no problem with those who truly believe and want to become a member of the tribe, but there is something demeaning in having your faith treated like a fad diet.  I need to think about this one some more because there are some positives that are associated with this, but I am not sure if they outweigh the negatives.

      "All my days I grew up among the sages, And I have found nothing better for a person than silence; And not the studying, but the doing is the main thing. And all who speak too much bring on sin. �Shimon ben Gamliel     Commentary [1:17] All my days... Shimon, as son of the Gamliel of the previous mishnah and the great grandson of Hillel, grew up surrounded by Torah scholars. Evidently, he had contact with many people who were brilliantly debating the interpretation of Torah, but not putting it into practice. This saying is an biting criticism of such behavior.  Not the studying, but the doing... This warning note is sounded against the background of Rabbinic tradition, which is almost obsessed with the importance of study. There is a famous subsequent debate on the issue of which is greater: study or deeds. At the beginning of the debate Rabbi Tarfon held that deeds are greater and Rabbi Akiva that study is greater. In the end all concluded that “Study is greater, for it leads to deeds.” This conclusion resolves the conflict by saying the two are always in harmony. However, Shimon’s saying is contradicts this conclusion: it clearly implies that there are learned people, including in Torah, who don’t act properly. Shimon ben Gamliel’s observation is unfortunately often corroborated today.  All who speak too much... This saying raises the question of what kind of speech is ‘too much’ in that it ‘brings on sin’. The sages called this speech lashon hara, ‘the bad tongue’ or ‘the evil tongue’. The current expression to ‘bad mouth’ somebody is similar. Maimonides, commenting on this mishnah, points out that ‘lashon hara’ refers to speech that is disparaging of others, even when it is true, and so does not actually constitute slander. Interestingly, the same kind of concept is found in Buddhist ethics.  Later sages believed that lashon hara is both an extremely common and an extremely grave sin. The Talmud says that the ancient Temple was destroyed partly because of lashon hara, and tells the story of an insult which sparked a chain of events that led to the Roman attack. They indicated that the evil tongue can be more vicious than the sword because it can “speak in Rome and kill in Syria, speak in Syria and kill in Rome.” And they compared it to an arrow which, once shot, cannot be taken back. Gossip that can cause strife between people, even if not lashon hara, is also directly prohibited by the Torah, as read by the Rabbis (Lev. 19:16).

I am awfully curious who has the distinction of having given out my email address.  With all the mail I receive I do feel awfully loved. And may I remind you that if you write me from your home address I know who you are, so you do not have the anonymity you think you do.  It is not that big a deal, really. If you want to write and badmouth me, go ahead. But remember that I may choose to respond. And then again, I may not.  The lack of literacy that exists is downright frightening. I wonder how some of you got out of school, maybe you didn't. It is not really my problem.  I am not the reason for all of your troubles, in spite of your desire to paint me as such.

      Even in 1896, security was a big issue at Athens Olympics  ATHENS (AFP) - Just as security is a big issue at the 2004 Olympics, which open on Friday in Athens, it preoccupied officials in the Greek capital back in 1896, when the modern Games were revived.   The chief of Athens police at the time was so worried that the hordes of thieves who roamed the streets of the capital and kidnappers who operated around the country would disrupt the Games that he asked them to declare an Olympic truce, mirroring the temporary break in hostilities observed by warring tribes in ancient Greece during the Olympics.  At the start of 1896, the authorities in Athens learned from reliable sources that pickpockets from Istanbul, Cairo and Alexandria were preparing to invade the Greek capital to take advantage of 'the good business opportunities' which the Olympics would provide for their deft fingers. But they weren't the only source of worry for those in charge of security. Few in Greece had forgotten the so-called 'Marathon murders', in which, in 1870, three Britons were kidnapped and killed by Greek thieves.  Robbery and kidnapping had become so commonplace in Greece in the 1800s, and had so severely tarnished the country's image, that the government was forced to take tough measures against the thieves and hostage-takers.  For the 1896 Games, an entire regiment of traditional Greek royal guards, Evzones, and two cavalry units were mobilised to provide security cover. The special security force numbered 400 men -- a "far cry from the 70,000 who will be on duty for the 2004 Games, but a considerable force for the time.   Athens' police force was granted a special allowance of 30,000 drachmas to allow it to beef itself up, Estia newspaper reported at the time. In comparison, an average ticket to the Olympics cost 1.3 drachmas.   Police were sent from the provinces to the capital and were given special training in "how to behave with foreigners," the paper wrote.   But despite the best efforts of the organisers and the government, Athenian newspaper Asty said a few weeks before the 1896 Games opened in March that "the lives of visitors and their property are in danger in the streets of the capital."   Athens police chief at the time, Dimitrios Bairaktaris, warned in an interview with Estia in February 1896 that "the flow of foreigners (into Athens) to celebrate the Games will doubtless bring with it numerous thieves and society dropouts, and only a good and severe police organisation can result in a situation without danger."   To achieve that end, Bairaktaris released Greek thieves from prison and held a mass meeting with them on the Pnyx, the hill that overlooks the Acropolis.   There, he asked them, in the name of Greece's legendary hospitality and honour, to monitor the activities of their "colleagues" and to ensure the safety of foreign visitors.   And if they refused, seeking instead to join their "colleagues" in a bit of light-fingered crime?   "Those who do not respect this decision will be beaten," warned the Police Review of the time.   The threat of lashings and the honour of Greece were enough for the local thieves. They vowed on the Pnyx to do Bairaktaris' bidding, and the Games went off with neither attacks nor robberies.   So proud was King George of the Greek's behaviour during the Olympics that he said in an interview with French newspaper Le Figaro: "Not one robbery was committed, not one pickpocket slipped into the crowd. Athens was protected by the probity of her people."    But after the foreign visitors had left the capital, the lingering thieves and dropouts made up for lost time by preying on provincial Greeks who had decided to prolong their stay in Athens after the games.  "After an entire week of exceptional security, they were like lambs to the slaughter at the hands of the thieves," the Police Review noted.

Instead, you must understand your time abuser's need for control and fear of evaluations. Of necessity, helping the time abuser change his ways will be a slow process -- the motivations for such abuse are unconscious, and many time abusers will be in a state of deep denial that only long-term therapy will ever completely cure. Yet the rewards of that kind of investment in your people can be great, indeed. The motivations that cause the time abuse are often the same ones that drive people to perform well, so it is very likely that your company's worst time abusers will also be its top performers."

        Some people will call this conspiracy theory, but I find it interesting. I am not sure if I buy into all of it...    The Third Terrorist by Bob Cheeks 16 July 2004  Jayna Davis has written the only accurate historical account of what happened at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995.     In June of 2001, with typical grit and determination, David Schippers, former Chicago crime-busting federal prosecutor and chief investigative counsel of the House Judiciary Committee for the 1998 impeachment trial of our perjurious president, William Jefferson Clinton, called the office of Attorney General John Ashcroft, demanding a meeting.     Managing only to reach a “deputy,” Schippers quickly came to the point, “I have in my office volumes of credible evidence indicating Middle Eastern involvement in the Oklahoma City bombing, and quite frankly, it scares the hell out of me.”   “If nothing is done,” he said presciently, “I’m afraid these terrorists are going to blow up Lower Manhattan.”   The Attorney General did not return the phone call. Three months later, Islamic terrorists massacred 3,000 innocent Americans in three separate attacks. The epicenter of these attacks was Lower Manhattan.   What were the “volumes of credible evidence” that Attorney Schippers wanted, so desperately, to convey to the Attorney General? Very simply, it was the fruit of several years of investigation compiled by former Oklahoma City television journalist, Jayna Davis. And, Ms. Davis, utilizing the hard earned information she made available to Schippers, has written a very sad, terrifying, and necessary book!   In a very real sense Jayna Davis has written the only accurate historical account of what happened at the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995. She has shown through diligence and hard work that a combination of Iraqi sleeper agents, two “lily white” mules -- Tim McVeigh and Terry Nichols-- Ramzi Yousef, then Al-Qaeda’s Philippine warlord, and a number of minor figures conspired under the leadership of the recently established “Armed Islamic Movement,” an organization that resulted from the “foreboding merger between Iran and Iraq,” to strike at America’s heartland.   Gathering the affidavits of twenty-two eyewitnesses she has proven that the “third terrorist” was Hussain Hashem Al-Hussaini, an Iraqi soldier in the first Gulf War, and the infamous “John Doe 2” who accompanied McVeigh to the Murrah Federal building in the ammonia nitrate fuel oil-ladened Ryder truck. She details the events leading up to the bombing and the escape of the Iraqis, as well as McVeigh’s serendipitous capture, by piecing together eyewitness testimony.    As riveting as Jayna Davis’s story is concerning the foreign-led conspiracy and the actual bombing, the account of her pleadings with the FBI and Congress reveal a dark and forbidding Byzantine bureaucracy whose frightening ineptness and malfeasance laid the cornerstone for America’s lack of preparedness for 9/11. On a number of occasions Ms. Davis tried to turn over to the FBI the twenty-two eyewitness affidavits she’d collected, which indicated an Islamic element in the conspiracy to bomb the Murrah building. But, repeatedly, the FBI refused to accept these witness statements (In 1997, the FBI declared that the Department of Justice “did not want any more documents for discovery” to burden the ongoing trial of Terry Nichols).   In 2002 Davis presented her information (eighty pages of eyewitness affidavits and twenty-three hundred pages of “corroborative documentation”) to Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter. The FBI’s six-page rebuttal to Davis’s mountain of evidence led the primary architect of the infamous “magic bullet theory” to declare that, in this case, “…the dots did not connect.”   Again in 2002, Davis’s ally, Attorney David Schippers, was contacted by Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert’s office. Schippers offered to provide witnesses for the Speaker but Hastert broke off contact. Also, that same year, Indiana Congressman Dan Burton’s Government Reform Committee “feigned” interest as a result of political pressure exerted back home. Burton even went so far as to send staffers to Oklahoma to interview witnesses. Unfortunately, Ms. Davis reports that, “All the witnesses complained that the congressional representatives came across as apathetic, posing only superficial questions, avoiding the topic of possible FBI malfeasance altogether.”   But not all of government’s beauracrats and politicians were deaf to Davis’s pleadings. In 1996 she contacted the then-acting director of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare, Israeli-born Yossef Bodansky. Bodansky is an expert on terrorism and the author of the best selling book Terror: The Inside Story of the Terrorist Conspiracy in America. Bodansky conducted his own investigation of the Oklahoma bombing and corroborated Davis’s witnesses’ testimony regarding the suspects. He also provided information concerning the recruitment of “lily whites” to be used in future terrorist strikes, Osama bin Laden’s “outreach” into the American heartland, terrorist training facilities in Chicago, and the independent Israeli/ATF report of the Oklahoma City bombing that declared “…the bomb which destroyed the Murrah building was constructed by Arab terrorists or people trained by Arab terrorists.”   If Ms. Davis’s book is accurate, and I have every reason to believe it is, and if Yossef Bodansky’s findings on behalf of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare are accurate, and I have every reason to believe they are, then the Murrah Federal Building was “…a deadly instrument of state policy by foreign adversaries.” It was nothing less than an act of war.   Jayna Davis’s book has shown that when the Clinton Administration ignored those responsible for the Murrah bombing they laid the groundwork for the massacre of 9/11. The book also shows that the war with Iraq is about as righteous as any war in which America has engaged. And, while the Bush Administration has erred in its insistence on “bringing democracy to Iraq” and in not pursuing the destruction of those nations that support the “Armed Islamic Movement,” a Kerry presidency will only endanger the lives of innocent Americans.   The Third Terrorist is available on Amazon.com.   Bob Cheeks has written for The American Enterprise, Human Events, Southern Partisan, and The Pittsburgh Tribune Review.

        I'd do this in a heartbeat.     urlLink The New York Times > Travel > Practical Traveler: Logging On at 30,000 Feet : "Logging On at 30,000 Feet By BOB TEDESCHI   Published: August 8, 2004 IN late May, Ortwin Freyermuth readied himself for an 11-hour flight from Munich to his Los Angeles home - a journey typically preceded by a flurry of last-minute e-mail messages, in anticipation of a day's worth of traveling incommunicado. This time, though, Mr. Freyermuth eased onto his Lufthansa flight less harried than on previous trips. When his plane reached cruising altitude, he opened up his iBook, logged onto the Internet and answered messages from 30,000 feet.   "It was amazing," said Mr. Freyermuth, a lawyer. "Now I don't have to stress out before every flight."   The price of a stress-free flight - Lufthansa's Connexion by Boeing service costs $30 for a long-haul flight (six hours or more), or $10 for 30 minutes - is perhaps more than some are willing to pay. But Connexion is at the leading edge of a trend that analysts and executives said will gain momentum this year, and is likely to lead to lower prices, a greater selection of vendors and much more mouse clicking on flights.  Connexion made its debut in May on Lufthansa, which calls its service FlyNet, and is the first full-feature, in-flight Internet service to reach travelers, after years of half-starts.   The airline industry had originally planned to roll out airborne Web surfing in late 2001, but companies shelved those plans after Sept. 11 and the ensuing financial malaise.  The service is only available to those with wireless Internet connections for their laptop or handheld computers. Increasingly wireless connections are built into portable devices, but those with older laptops can buy a wireless PC card for $50 to $100. What you get is a better experience than most Internet users receive at home. Wireless connection speeds are generally up to 20 times faster than those of dial-up service, and if just a few people are logged on in the plane, the speed can rival that of some workplace connections. And unlike many workplace Internet connections, Connexion's service offers unrestricted Web access.  5 Planes and Counting  So far, five Lufthansa airplanes are equipped with the satellite receivers and wireless networks necessary to run the system, and the only routes served as of July were Munich-Los Angeles and Munich-Tokyo. But the company plans to equip all of its long-range aircraft with the technology, and add New York routes by the end of the year.  According to Terrance Scott, a Connexion spokesman, Japan Airlines will be the next to add the service, sometime this summer or early fall, followed by Scandinavian Airlines and All Nippon Airways. Singapore Airlines, China Airlines and Korean Air will follow early next year. Mr. Scott said Connexion is in "active discussions" with several United States carriers, but none has signed on yet.   Boeing's chief rival, Airbus, is part owner of Tenzing, a competing service that claims to have been first to send an e-mail message from an aircraft (four years ago this month). Tenzing has allowed airline passengers to send and receive e-mail messages on about 800 United, Continental and US Airways airplanes since 2003, using dial-up cables connected to Verizon Airfones.  Changes are coming to that system as well, though. Until this month, customers had to pay $16 a flight to log into Verizon's JetConnect system, a closed Internet universe of sorts that lets customers click through about 800 pages of news, sports, stock quotes and games, among other things, while also sending and receiving text messages, instant messages and e-mail.  But now Tenzing's e-mail service is available separately for $10 on domestic flights and $20 for international flights, with added charges for sending and receiving attachments. (JetConnect's services, except e-mail, are also available for $6 per flight segment.) According to Alex McGowan, vice president for marketing, Tenzing also plans to offer lower prices for shorter flights this year, probably below $5 for flights of up to two hours. In addition to the United States-based carriers, Tenzing is available, with satellite service, on Cathay Pacific and Emirates; Iberia will follow in November.  Tenzing, for now, operates at roughly the same speed as most dial-up modem connections, because it relies on lower frequency signals to send and retrieve data. But speeds could improve considerably, depending on whether the airline chooses a satellite connection.   Verizon's JetConnect will also get a speed boost next year, while freeing customers from the constraints of wires. Pending Federal Communications Commission approval, the company will begin offering JetConnect through a high-speed wireless connection in late 2005.  Hot Spots in Terminals  For passengers on airplanes without Internet services, it may still make sense to keep the laptop in the carry-on luggage, as many airports are rolling out wireless Internet access in terminals, lounges and even on the sidewalks. According to Jupiter Research, a market research company, at least 25 of the nation's 50 busiest airports offer so-called wireless hot spots in public areas.  La Guardia's central terminal has had wireless access (for $6.95 a day) since early 2003, said Tiffany Townsend, a spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The US Airways terminal will offer the service by year's end. Newark's Terminals A and B have wireless access, and Terminal C will by wired by December. Kennedy Airport wired Terminals 8 and 9 this year; Terminals 1 through 7 are to follow between now and the end of next year.   Most airport Web sites will tell you whether wireless access is available, but if that fails, you can log onto JiWire.com, Wi-fiHotSpotList.com, LocFinder.net or other sites.   What you pay - if anything - depends on where you are, according to Julie Ask, an analyst with Jupiter Research. Ms. Ask said that a handful of regional airports, like Long Beach Airport in California, or Blue Grass Airport in Lexington, Ky., offer free wireless Internet access as a way to compete against their larger rivals. The services aren't currently used by many travelers, Ms. Ask said, since only 25 percent of Internet users have surfed on wireless, or wi-fi, connections. But, she said, that number is expected to grow steadily.  At Blue Grass Airport, travelers and nontravelers have used the free Internet connection in a multitude of ways. According to Thomas Tyra, the airport's manager of marketing and community relations, the airport installed its wireless system at a cost of $17,000 in late 2001. Now, he said, roughly 100 of the airport's 2,700 daily passengers use the service.  The Internet signal extends throughout the terminal including the gates and lobby and 300 feet outside the building. "People can circle around the airport and check to see if flights are arriving, so they don't have to pay to park," Mr. Tyra said.  Wireless users can get equally creative in the air. On the trip from Munich, Mr. Freyermuth, who uses a Macintosh, attached his iSight camera to his laptop and set up a videoconference with his son. "It would've been great," Mr. Freyermuth said, "but he wasn't logged on."

      I am not sure where I want to begin or if there is a beginning. This Blog is read by a number of people, a number that I cannot begin to track. Well, I could, the technology exists but it doesn't really matter that much to me. Some of you have the means to contact me outside of here and we discuss the various things that pass through these bits and bytes and others don't. What difference does it make anyway.  The purpose of this place is for me to work on my writing, to share my thoughts on events in my life and the world around me and to eventually provide my children and whomever else with a chance to see that many of the challenges that they face are not new, they are simply repackaged and possibly repurposed.  So I sit here and spew out the thoughts that tumble around my skull, the ones that jingle jangle and tingle tangle this way and that. Jack's head is a constant storm, a tumultuous turmoil of tomfoolery searching for a momentary respite. Where is the eye of the storm, every now and then I like to find it so that I can catch my breath and then it is back into the wild. Chaos surrounds me, drama is attached to my very being. Ok, could that sound anymore ridiculous, probably not.  I tend to write one draft and then just go with it. I don't like looking backwards because whatever it is that got left behind just might catch up and get me.   How scary. ;)   In any case G-d blessed me with a modicum of ability and I can usually squeeze out a solid effort without too much trouble. I think that this has been double-edged sword. Most topics in school were relatively easy and those that were not usually required just a little effort. The end result was that I got bored and that led to my questioning the coursework and instruction even more than the  super defiant Jack was doing prior to the onset of boredom.  So for my children I want a couple of things. First, I want them to push harder than I did. It was a mistake and I could have made things easier for myself had I decided to focus a little bit more. But that is me, I do things my way and that doesn't always mean the easy way even if it is available.  But I also want my children to be placed in classes that challenge them. I want them to have to think, I want them to be surrounded with children that are motivated, smart and interested in learning. Probably not very different than other parents, but very necessary. The extra effort early on makes so much of a difference.  I wonder what they will be like, my children that is. My son is so very bright and so interested in the world. I see so much of myself, so many little things and then there are so many other qualities. Thankfully he got his mother's disposition, he is far more tolerant, but he does have my defiance. And I swear that he is already so much smarter than I am. And I would be nothing but happy to see that happen. He and my daughter should be a hundred times more successful and smarter. More importantly, I wish them nothing but happiness.  I am so thankful that they are relatively oblivious to what is happening with my father. My dad will end up being ok, but it has been a long haul. The road to bringing him back has been tough, it has taken a lot out of me. I'd be lying if I said that I haven't felt overwhelmed at times, but at the same time I don't know how to do anything but plow ahead. I suppose that the opportunity to whine to cyberspace has made it more tolerable, but at the same time my nature is to never, ever surrender, never.  In the last year I have watched my three surviving grandparents slowly deteriorate. They are all 90. Mentally they are all still there, albeit with some age appropriate memory loss. But I can see that sooner or later the end will reach even them. As Pink Floyd says you can run and you can run but the sun keeps on sinking. And that sun is sinking, little things are turning into bigger things. Health issues are starting to pile up and all we can do is try and live in the present. I try to, but sometimes it is hard. Sometimes I fear that something will happen to one or more before my parents return home.  And at 35 I know that my parents are people, they breathe and bleed just like I. My son thinks that I am invulnerable, I am Superman, but the curtain has been drawn back on my parents and I know that the Mighty Oz has the same magic as I. And that means that one day their strength will fail and I will have to bid them goodbye. It is no different with my grandparents, but they have always been "old" so while the thought of not having them makes a lump in my throat, the idea that I might have to tell my parents almost bothers me more.  I think that it is because in some way I don't want them to have to show me the human side. I am searching for the superpeople who had all of the answers. And maybe, just maybe that is because of the crazy year I had. I spent my 35th birthday asking G-d not to rob my children of their grandfather. They really were not sure if he would live.  I had to talk to my mother about what happened if Dad died. My mother is incredibly strong, but even in her eyes their was a distant look that told me that even as she hoped and prayed she knew that it was possible.  And at the same time I couldn't help but remember the look on my grandfather's face when I told him that my uncle had died. It hurt then, but at 25 I wasn't a father yet and because of that I was spared the horror of outliving a child. And that is a fear that all parents share, whether we voice it or not.  It is a pain that I cannot begin to imagine, but looking back on those days I remember my grandfather's face and I remember his tears. I wasn't supposed to share that with him, he wasn't supposed to be exposed to that piece of Hell. Oh well, life is what happens while we pontificate and talk about what should be happening as opposed to what is going on.  I watched Adam Sandler in "Punch-Drunk Love" last night. It was quirky, but very enjoyable. I recognized a number of the locations in the film, not that it matters.

      Today is August 6, 2004. It is almost 4 months since my parents left for New Jersey to witness the birth of grandchild number 4. Just in case my sister decides to read this let me clarify and say that they were not going to witness, they were heading out to celebrate the birth of number 4. The birth of a grandchild is always exciting and this was particularly auspicious as they knew that a couple of months later number 5 would join them out here in L.A.  As previously noted, people plan and G-d laughs. My father got pneumonia, had a heart attack, pulmonary complications and then ended up with a triple bypass, all of which has kept them trapped in New Jersey. For a long while it seemed like he wasn't going to make it, but things have worked in our favor and it appears that a full recovery is quite likely.  However there have been a number of kinks in the plan and the return home is in doubt. Well, not in doubt, but the timeline is fuzzy. It would be a bit of an exaggeration to compare this to Columbus and his return to Spain, but what the heck, let's do it. Just as Columbus knew that eventually he'd go see old King Fernie and Queen Izzy again my father knows that he'll greet the dawn here in Sunny LA again, we are just not sure when.  In the interim I am still responsible for three 90 year-old grandparents and two households, not to mention an infant, a 3.5 year-old, wife, mortgage, the war in Iraq and the capture of OBL. Ok, that is an exaggeration too, perhaps I am more prone to hyperbole than I thought.  Baby is crying, time to run.

      Proposed Dutch law would ban unsolicited toe-licking"  AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (Reuters) -- Unsolicited toe-licking would be banned in the Netherlands under a law sought by the Dutch Labor party after police were unable to prosecute a would-be Casanova with a taste for female toes because he had committed no crime.  A police spokesman said Friday a man had been detained after women sunning themselves in Rotterdam's parks and beaches claimed he had snuck up on them and begun to lick their toes.  "The officers had to let him go. Licking a stranger's toes is rather unusual but there is really nothing criminal about it," the spokesman said.  Dutch press reports said the man, who is about 35, had been licking the toes of strangers for about three years but was only recently caught by police.  Peter van Heemst, a Labor member of parliament, asked Christian Democrat Justice Minister Piet Hein Donner Friday to explain why Dutch laws forbid littering but not uninvited toe-licking. Van Heemst demanded an amendment prohibiting it.  "It is a violation of one's privacy and one's physical integrity," he told a local news agency. "The norm... is that no one should touch your body if you haven't asked them first."  A spokesman for Donner said the minister could not immediately comment.     Yummy.

      I work in a field in which kids straight out of college are given way too much responsibility for people that are that green. It makes for a bad mix. Their employers promise them very exciting and lucrative futures and then treat them like indentured servants.  The end result is that some of them take their responsibility very seriously and diligently work at learning the trade and trying to learn the ins and outs of the business. Others take the responsibility as as a license to take themselves way too seriously and abuse the people that they need to work with.  The problem is that this abuse is something that we the account executives remember, and none too highly. If you think that you can bullshit us into spending copious amounts of our expense accounts on you and not see any reciprocity you are setting yourself up for failure. Just as you tykes can cut us out of a deal and make like less comfortable we can find ways to make your life in indentured servitude land feel like a lifetime sentence at Sing Sing.  This kind of adversarial relationship is unnecessary and stupid. In large part it is created because YOU do not listen. YOU do not return telephone calls or respond to email and when you do you give stupid answers that indicate that you really do not understand what YOU are talking about.  This forces our hand. If you do not respond we are trained and programmed to go Terminator on you. We will be relentless in searching for a way around you. That may mean calling your client and telling them that you are an ignorant, uneducated cur that is wasting their money. And while they may protect you publically, they will kick your sorry behind all over the place behind closed doors.  Remember, when you think that we are just mercenaries who are coldblooded, money grubbers there are those who are not. And even if that was the case for all of us (it isn't) our livelihoods depend on our ability to produce. We have supervisors who sit on our necks and crap on us if we are not getting it done. What do you think is going to happen. How do you think we are going to respond.  Beyond that, we understand that the agency has screwed you and that the client is simulating a prepubescent rant. We know that you do not know much, so let us help you. It is mutually beneficial. We can support each other and make life far easier.  But, do not abuse that trust by asking us to do your work. You are the ad agency. You are supposed to have a house full of professional creative types. We can work with you on developing ideas/concepts, but we do not get paid by the agency/client to produce those by ourselves.  If you ask us to do this you are creating another component of the adversarial relationship. We know that there is a ton of turnover in your industry and we will help facilitate that. It is not nice, it is not fair, but it is too much of dog eat dog environment. We cannot survive when you act this way.  Also, you need to remember that one day the situation may turn and you may find that you are not in the current position of power. It has happened before and it will happen again. If you burn bridges everywhere you go you will find that you are up a creek and they haven't built the paddle you can use to get out.  End of rant.

      "Job Opening: Surely You Jest...  Thu Aug 5,12:20 PM ETAdd Oddly Enough - Reuters to My Yahoo!

English Heritage said in an advertisement in the Times on Thursday applicants for the competition at the weekend should bring their own costumes with bells, but said it would provide a bladder on a stick -- a traditional jester's prop.  Contrary to the image of a buffoon, court jesters had to be highly astute, able to lift the spirits of their monarchs and risked death if they failed -- as many did.  The duties of the last court jester, whose job ended in 1649 when Charles I lost his head, included making him laugh and providing a distraction from politics.

      It has been quite a week. The email inbox has been the receptacle of some poor logical constructs about all sorts of things. I say poor because the type of thing that I have received has been similar to this.   "Jack, you are a man. Jack-the-Ripper was a man too. Therefore you must be him."      Glad to see that the UN inspectors are among the readers here.  It just makes me shake my head, especially when I read the rest of these notes. Wild accusations and just ridiculous notions. It makes me wonder if these folks placed all of their eggs in the Enron basket and then blame the world for all of their problems.   That doesn't absolve Ken Lay of blame, but it does serve as a reminder that diversification is important.  High risk, high reward, but the penalty is stiff.

      "Science Puzzles Out What Makes Some of Us More Attractive to Mosquitoes "  "Imagine you're a mosquito, the feminine variety, and your customary three-day fast is over. Bottom line: You wanna suck blood.  What about that dog? Nah, the mutt's smell does nothing for you. That kid on the patio? Might be good, but a breeze just stole his scent. Whoa, check out the lady across the street. Now we're talking.  Weeding the garden on a sultry day, she's working up a lather -- even 75 feet away, an easy sniff. Best of all, she's not wearing socks. Oh, baby, there's something special about those stinky feet.  It's true, scientists say: When it comes to picking food, mosquitoes find some poor souls especially delectable.  "Smell is really everything," said Laurence Zwiebel, a Vanderbilt University molecular biologist.  Evolution has spawned a diverse population of skeeters, spanning several hundred species and every continent except Antarctica. Some prefer cows. Others like birds or frogs. But two facts are common to all: Only females bite. And highly sensitive olfactory systems -- most pronounced in the antenna -- are used to sniff out targets long before a skeeter lands.  Science is working vigorously to understand this miraculous smelling system. Short-circuiting mosquitoes' prime navigational system might prevent millions of malaria deaths each year, as well as cases of West Nile virus, yellow fever and other mosquito-born diseases. It might also bring relief to those unfortunate folks who emit the body-odor blends that make hungry mosquitoes go berserk."    For the rest of the story please use the link above.

          This has always been one of my favorite essays. A couple of nuggets:        There is a time in every man's education when he arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for better, for worse, as his portion; that though the wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. The power which resides in him is new in nature, and none but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.   "No law can be sacred to me but that of my nature."

      It is now a little more than a week since the birth of my daughter. I have sent out 2.35 million notices to the parents of little boys notifying them that if they want to date my daughter they better start preparing to meet my 1,235 guidelines. My workouts have intensified, I have to really stay sharp if I am going to be an intimidating 50 year-old man.  In the meantime my 3.5 year-old finds that life as he knows it will never be the same. Overall he has taken this all in stride, but he still manages to find ways to let me know that he is not happy. There was the screaming fit in which he begged his grandparents to take him own. There was the urinating on the couch because he suddenly forgot his potty-training and the general defiant attitude that my friends and family say is a perfect imitation of your's truly.  Slowly but surely we have taken the chaos surrounding the birth and have been shaping it into something manageable, a routine is forming. I can see daylight again, but it will take time to reach it.  I also learned that checking a girl's diaper to see if it is wet is a little different than a boys. The location of the "wetness" is a little lower. This may sound like basic stuff, but I never changed a girl's diaper prior to doing so for my daughter. Live and learn.  Anyway, I am not sure which little boy in this house has more going on. But if I could trade places with my little one, I might consider it. It might be nice to go back to playing all day. It is Summer after all, the perfect time to spend in joyful expressions of youth.

      "The Alamoudi story points to the urgent need that the FBI, White House, Congress, State Department, Pentagon, and Homeland Security � as well as other institutions, public and private, throughout the West � not continue guilelessly to assume that smooth-talking Islamists are free of criminal, extremist, or terrorist ties. Or, as I put it in late 2001: 'Individual Islamists may appear law-abiding and reasonable, but they are part of a totalitarian movement, and as such, all must be considered potential killers.' Militant Islam is the enemy; even its slickest adherents need to be viewed as such."    We live in a different world in which we are going to be placed in a position in which we need to take a serious look at how our society operates and determine how much risk we are willing to assume and how many liberties we are willing to abridge so that we can protect ourselves.

      "FORT BRAGG, North Carolina (CNN) -- Army Pfc. Lynndie England, almost seven months' pregnant and looking glum, arrived Tuesday morning for the start of a preliminary hearing that could lead to a court-martial for her part in the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal."    Sometimes young people don't take the time to consider their actions. This is one young lady who is going to pay the price for her indiscretion, and rightly so.

       "'Every pilot I talk to feels like they're being pushed to the limit,' says Captain Meher. 'It hasn't created a problem yet, but it could.'"  That is not very reassuring.

      I don't agree with many of the articles on this site, but I agree that Arafat is an impediment.

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Patients Face Long Wait for Colonoscopies : "Patients Face Long Wait for Colonoscopies   Sun Aug 1, 9:24 AM ETAdd Health - AP to My Yahoo!   BOSTON - Recommendations from medical specialists that healthy adults be screened for colon cancer has resulted in hundreds of thousands of people seeking colonoscopies, producing long waits for the test and straining hospital resources.    'The demand is endless and limitless and beyond anyone's expectations,' Dr. William Brugge, director of endoscopy at Massachusetts General Hospital, told the Boston Sunday Globe. The hospital expects to conduct 25,000 colonoscopies and other gastrointestinal imaging procedures in 2004, a 20 percent jump in one year. "

      I thought that I would test out playing music in the background that I think is appropriate to words I post, so I posted to AudioBlogger and played 2 minutes worth of the theme to Rocky, but it doesn't seem to want to allow text and the audio in the same post. I suspect that the way to get around that would be to post the audio and then write whatever I wanted in the comments.  Not a huge deal, but I thought that it might be kind of fun to share my thoughts and the music that accompanies them. Here is my iTunes library. It is incomplete, I own about 400 CDs, countless tapes and a ton of albums:   Name Artist  Fanfare For The Common Man  Aaron Copland  Dancing Queen  ABBA  Waterloo  ABBA  The Lonesome Kicker  Adam Sandler  Dream On  Aerosmith  Remember When  Alan Jackson  City Of New Orleans  Arlo Guthrie  Never My Love  The Association  Turn Up the Radio  Autograph  Rock Lobster  The B-52's  Stayin' Alive  Bee Gees  I Go To Extremes  Billy Joel  Human Behaviour  Björk  The Mighty Quinn (Quinn, the Eskimo)  Bob Dylan  Do You Wanna Hold Me?

The list above contains a collection of tunes that I enjoy for various reasons. I am in the process of dropping in songs from my collection so that I can enjoy MP3 versions of all of my music, but it is quite a task and the kids seem to need my attention. ;)  Anyway, the point of this post changed and I lost my muse. I'll have to come back to it later. Drats. Besides it is time for the midnight feeding. Tomorrow morning will be tough. Oh well.

      No surprises here, the old terrorist has been unable to change his ways and has interminably hindered the peace process and hurt his people.

      Election time is prime time for encountering people who know more than the rest of us. If you listen closely you'll find friends/relatives/colleagues who have "a feeling about people" or "insider knowledge" about how things really work. They may actually be truthful, but sometimes it is all in the presentation.  You can be impressive in expressing/sharing your knowledge or you can be a pompous, bombastic icon of hyperbole. The former makes it far more enjoyable to discuss common issues of interest and the latter just makes you earn for a pacifier for adults, some kind of plug.  But even the boor can have something interesting to say....sometimes.

       urlLink George Will: Party conventions and platforms : "It is commonly said that ``9/11 changed everything.'' But it did not really change the basic fact of today's politics. Even before 9/11, the 57-point disparity between Bush's support from Republicans (88 percent) and Democrats (31 percent) was larger than any polling had ever recorded for any president. Strange but true: The 36 days following the 2000 election -- Florida -- may have had a bigger impact on American politics than did Sept. 11, 2001."    It is not that profound, but I agree with will about the 36 days. It points to a central issue in which some Americans accept and others deny Bush's legitimacy as POTUS. And if from the beginning you do not think that he should be POTUS it makes every other real or imaginary mistake that much more egregious.
