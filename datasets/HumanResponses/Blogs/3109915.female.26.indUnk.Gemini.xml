      ok, so i think everything should work now... i will eventually have a larger gallery section, but i need pictures.... all the rest of the areas should have some content, and dont miss the groovy jukebox..     56k people should be able to click through the intros,  800X600 people shouldnt have to scroll, and flash isnt necessary for navigations... :)      who knows.. i need to go  make money now, so the site will remain the way it is for a week or two more...   ciao all- chas

      hi there all.  so this is pretty much all i can think of doing with chastyti.com ....    besides new gallery pictures, which will eventually be the start of a monthly sort of series nothing major is going to change....

<post>

	 
      if there is anything else you would like to see, just message in the shout box...   thats what its for there on the left of the screen   i am pretty much stuck save for new pictures....  there will be alot of content added in the main sections of the site (escort model etc..) but, no one seems to want to read that stuff more than once anyways....      the FAQ will be expanded for more non interactive sort of things like messenger status, etc... oh, and yahoo's new messenger is going to support flash based avatars/dollies... or i guess it does now, but the client is in beta... anyways, i like the idea and i am running so if we happen to chat you get to see the happy ass'd avatar of ME! :)   so today i went through the gallery interfaces and tried to tweak things out a bit more... the happy fade bar background is all over the place now,  none of the auxillary areas should scroll (if you havent checked em out,  the flash based galleries are pretty neat)     i intend to do a low bandwith version and a text only version but that is a matter of time...  maybe after i get to new orleans... who knows...

      hi there..    so some people have been talking to me here,   that is really cool..   the whole point of me doing this site this way is try to actually meet some REAL people that might have more going on with their big heads rather than their little ones...   (of course if your little one is BIG then that works too :)     plus, since i am sort of obsessive about tweaking, its kind of a good way to actually get my attention.  -----------------------------  anyways,  so i put a real quick like low bandwith and text version in the very front of the page...   it hits the rest of the page in the right places to   i am about to try to start promoting the site off of just the personal sites...   banner exchanges are kind of stuck in the front now and that will go away and get better organized per area, etc.  there are web rings coming and of course the mother of all mothers, google to also try to get attention from....  i still cant figure out what sort of audience i am getting so i dont know what else to put here...  i mean i could put a forum or some sort of link exchange or whatever, but if no one uses it then??     there are two new galleries, from the same shoot.   i am putting one on the site and public groups,  the other will be available in the private areas off the site....  for now, just ask to join the yahoo group...  urlLink   here..     it will eventually turn into some sort of pay gallery, so its kind of a good idea to join now if you are into that sort of thing  and last but not least  - tee hee,   the FAQ area has everything that used to be all over the place as well as a place for a faq...  (again, since no one goes there whats the point) the IM status,  weather, etc....  are all there...  i am trying to figure out how to make it both a status button and a faq / help sort  of thing...  but really this will all have to wait to i get settled.. who knows...  maybe i will split the areas into different domains...  anyways, thats it for now -chas

      hi there all..   so maybe it will warm up here in blesseed OHIO  ... nothing much going on the compu front ... but i wanted to plug our good, vanilla friends at yahoo...       urlLink  they have a new messenger client in beta that is pretty slick....    among lots of things it should have done all along (like selective invisiblity, multiple handles at once,  radio and addressbook integration, etc...) the crazy coolest thing it does is support flash based avatars....   ie- dollies.  that will change their expression as you chat based on the smilies....   really too cool.. and of course you get to see mine :)    anyways, talk more later... ciao

      hi all.  so i stuck the first set of recent pics in the red gallery..   the rest of the lingerie shot is in process, some of the  pics seemed to come out really well based on the feedback i am getting  in them,  i am rolling around on a bed with black lingerie, have a look.. they are the sexiest pictures i have released... imho of  course   bibi for now, the rest of the shoot will be released soon    :)

      :: site updates - mid may ::  so the main menu has been going nuts.. nearly done with it, but the low bandwith people arent seeing alot of the updates.. :(   my real world life is keeping me busy but i am trying to groom the full site for a commercial sort of release...   like i said before the domain's might be split off in the near future...  but anyways,   i have been doing work that i think the photo people might enjoy. i am really excited about it.. the private yahoo group (chastytilayne) has some of the new galleries and these little mirrory ones are from it too.  just did a bedroom shoot which is the sexiest pictures i have taken to date.  imho    stay tuned  and think positive thoughts for me  :)  chas

      hi there  all,   so the garage sale is over...  tee hee i sold a barn off the property,  we did pretty good... now i can pay off the traffic courts and keep my cell on...   you go try being a tgirl in the fucking countryside of rural Ohio...   anyways, the entrance to the site is changed (if you didnt notice) and i am moving things around so i can have a pay gallery as soon as i am ready..  i have been working on doing adult stills and film, so if all goes well there will be a dirtier side of chas...    supposedly there is an audience willing to pay for pics if they were explicit..   thats what the poll said anyways.  check out the slideshow (blush)  its where you can see the first lingerie shoot i did..  these will probalby be the "teaser" or tourpics..  and the yahoo groups will be the best place to get some of the new content...  the public group has at least one contributed gallery as well, girls feel free to send in pics... i think i am going to try to annouce messages about girls and stuff that join up....     do you guys think that would be competition?   hmmmm....  ooh, i found you can make your yahoo groups news feeds like my diaries are...   check this out... :)     urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chastyti/messages?rss    urlLink http://groups.yahoo.com/group/chastyti/photos?rss  this little page - www.bloglines.com is like an web based aggregator you can use also, to show people news all at once....    chastyti  -chas

      hi there all..  i have been playing with these pages and getting them ready to split off.   each of the areas i work with have their own subdomains.. like model.chastyti.com   domme.chastyti.com  etc...   and then of course each of those will be split off into seperate domains,   yay!     anyways, i am trying to make money off this website without being like all the other ones...   so i chose amazon's donation system..   its in place, you cant miss it if you look at the galleries..  if anyone wants to throw me a dollar please do..   this freelance stuff is not the most lucrative, you know?    bibi for now chas

      hi there all,    urlLink ::::::::NEW PREVIEW GALLERY::::::::   so maybe you have noticed,   i have been changing things around on my site alot...  i got the amazon thing in place, but i really hate their buttons...    so i fixed that up....   and there is new content in almost every area...   little navigation changes, etc...  pretty much i am done now..     oh and by the way, we are breaking all sorts of my personal traffic records, like upwards of 1000 different people a day are coming through..  -------------------------------- anyways, so all this babbling is leading up to  that last little bit of unseen content i currently have.    for the people that have been with me since day one,   this is new stuff...  this preview gallery is me in "action"  lol...   but its from back in the day so you might not recognize me.  this is the last bit of updates i intend to do on the current domain structures..  i have already split off into domme.chastyti.com, model.chastyti.com  etc.  if you want a peek as the new websites are developed  (no there isnt anything there yet)  for the next few weeks i have three shoots scheduled and a trip to pittsburgh...      stay tuned....  and if you are in pittsburgh do let me know,   the trip is for friday.        we will just have to wait and see what happens now...     yours truly,   Miss Chastyti    urlLink ::::::::NEW PREVIEW GALLERY::::::::
