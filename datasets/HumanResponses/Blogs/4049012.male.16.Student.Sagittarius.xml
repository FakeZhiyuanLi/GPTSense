       Well, I just got my " urlLink Vitalogy " CD today in the mail and tis good. I was kind of expecting a filler album after " urlLink Vs. ", but it's got some nice songs [Nothingman, Corduroy, Spin The Black Circle, Immortality, Tremor Christ], in particular. And I got it for about 2 bucks. Go used CDs. And the damn thing isn't even scratched, but the cover is kinda worn, but, eh, oh well. It still plays well.    urlLink The site , in case you want to know something about Pearl Jam, etc.

       Hehe. Oh, the irony. And the hilarity. My colon.  From  urlLink  SomethingAwful's Link Of The Day  (July 31st) , someone discovered  urlLink  This   blog/Xanga/whatever the hell it is, and the irony is just too much. Oh, God. Another emo teenage girl with "guy problems". Oh, she cuts herself. What a walking cliche. Yeah, she and 17 million other teenage girls who put out frequently but have to maintain this bullshit image as little saints. And, even better, this was her reply to SA's article:    "how fucking gay for now on i make a commitment to try and spell all my words right because  ppl who dont know me are making fun of me for bad spelling...you know most the world cant spell for shit and everyone who starts posting on here becuase they read awful link of the day cant spell they are only going to spellcheck for the post they make on my zanga so they dont look like a totall dummass making fun of me..i say fuck you all get over yer perfectness of spelling just because im nikki and could give a rats ass if you ppl like my spelling or if its correct go fuck a tree im not commiting my self anymore i changed my mind in the last 30 seconds to never spell check agian!!!...ok will im probaly just ranting on about that shit beccause this past week i bin pissed coz ppl who must bitch and annoy bitching is my job when i want to its just a well kno nikki thing others its stupid and annoying and look theyve accomplished making me bitch..well anyways uhh yea brittaney stayed the week here and left today yesterday i had to go to sum gay park fair thing amabob and kc n shane came with me n brittaney ....wahooo i think i may of gone a litlle psyco yelling at sumpoints but who gives a shit ceartinly not me..  well goodaymates and those who hate  ~inally inlove with the right guy~"   I don't even know what to say to that. How about this:   "for now on i make a commitment to try and spell all my words right because  ppl who dont know me are making fun of me for bad spelling..."   Dear Lord...'for now on'. Um, the word is "from". And it's "try to spell". And "ppl" is not a cute, original, or insightful acronym. In fact, none are. Spell your fucking words. You've got no excuse to be a prissy little bitch. You're 17 years of fucking age. That's one year from being regarded as a legal adult. I assume you're been educated, or, at least sat in school. So don't play these little "Oh, I can't spell. Why is everyone so mean?!11" games with me. You know damn well about grammar and spelling, so use it. It makes it really difficult for intelligent people to read your dribble. Oh, well, I guess that's not a problem for your fellow illiterate emo/goth friends.   And...um...   "~inally inlove with the right guy~"   No, no you're not. You may think so now because:  a). the sex is amazing b). he gives you money and things c). you have him whipped d). he frightens you into loving him  Trust me, you're 17. It ain't love.  ---  Just felt the need to expand on that. Well, because, it is a fucking epidemic and I'm tired of reading poorly written bullshit. It's not hard to make something legible, assholes. Just do it. Oh, damn, their comebacks are always "well don't read it if you don't want 2 lolz". Actually, no. Don't give me your little passive, teen-liberal excuses. The internet is being infected with morons who reproduce by the millions every fucking day. Not only do you type poorly, but you also think the world revolves around you and your trivial little life, which consists of fucking, eating and shopping with your girlfriends who you'll eventually turn to when that one "special" guy abuses you. So, please, please just make a tiny effort to not look like a retard.  Thanks.

       Well, here we are again, at 10 am...after a night of no sleep. I swear, I really need to get my sleep schedule turned around. Egh. School starts on August 10th, so I'm gonna be fucked if I don't start working on it now. But, anyway, things have been slow here, as usual. The usual torrent of DNC material is coming at full speed, of course, and I have to rant to fend it off. Kerry's just like Clinton, really. He can stand up there and make all the little promises he wants; I just want to see them materialize. Hell, at this point, we're obviously being forced to pick the lesser of two evils, which is obviously John Kerry. I'm not a slimy democrat, and I'm not a fat swine of a Republican, but eh, Kerry is the only alternative.  In the four years Bush has "run" this country, what has he done? Made some tax cuts. Woo. Started a war. Bigger woo. It's not really the fact that I hate the man as much as it is that he's done nothing for us. Nothing. And the only defense pro-Bush morons have is the "war on terrorism". Um, yes. Depleting the national treasury in a 3rd world country. And as if it's even a fair fight. So far, the only reason Americans have been killed is rogue Iraqis with mortars and metal objects. No weapons of mass destruction...no nuclear plan...not shit. Just a nation of people we've managed to piss off even further.   So, yeah, vote for Bush again this November. Come on, I dare ya. See where it gets you.   Anyway...I'm going to sleep. Adios.

       Well, I've decided to let my old blog die out, since it pretty much was dead for the past 3 months. So, I'll be dumping  urlLink livejournal  eventually. Mainly because blogspot doesn't, ya know, suck. It's 7:30 am...and, surprisingly, the hangover from last night hasn't struck yet. So, I'm off to bed before it does. Adios.  &nbsp;

       Well, I'm really considering just leaving the intranet altogether. It seems to be quite a large fraction of my problems. People problems. Well, for one, there's the bastards who constantly tell me about their boyfriend/girlfriend/gerbil. Now, I'm sure most people wouldn't care about that. It might even be a tad annoying. But, no. I am jealous. And if that makes me insecure or as shallow as anyone else, then so be it. I have a low tolerance for shit, so you see my problem. I don't need to hear how happy Mr. X is with Ms. X, or vice versa. I'm happy for them, I'm just not happy about being subjected to every little menial happening in their lives. I don't care. You're a bunch of stupid, shallow, small-minded teenagers who think the world of each other. Tell someone else how tight Ms. X is, but don't ever fucking tell me again. Sorry is it's "elitist" or what have you, but lately, I'm just not in a good place. So it'd be better, if any of you who actually talk to me, to just keep it basic, and avoid the aforementioned.  See, the anxiety itself isn't so bad, but when it's exacerbated by shit, I become...well...depressed. So please, if you feel the need to exclaim powerfully about your little affair, do it elsewhere. Perhaps pick up a " urlLink livejournal " and do it there.  Thanks.

       I feel like posting something music related. Enjoy.  "Sheets of empty canvas, Untouched sheets of clay Were laid, spread out before me As her...body once did All five horizons revolve around her soul As the earth to the sun Now the air I tasted and breathed has...taken a turn  Ooh, and all I taught her was...everything Ooh, I know she gave me all, that she wore  And now my bitter hands, chafe beneath the clouds All the pictures have, all been washed in black Tattooed everything  I take a walk outside I'm surrounded by, some kids at play I can feel their laughter, so...why do I seer? Ooooh, and twisted thoughts that spin 'Round my head I'm spinnin', oh, I'm spinnin' How quick the sun can...drop away  Now my bitter hands Cradle broken glass Of what was everything? Oh, the pictures have...all been washed in black Tattooed everything All the love gone bad Turn my world to black Tattooed all I see, all that I am I'll that I'll be Yeah...uh huh...  I know someday you'll have a beautiful life I know you'll be a star In somebody else's sky But, why Why Why? Can't it be... Can't it be...mine Aaahhha...ah, yeah...ooooh...."

       Ya know what's funny? The experience of watching some slutty (or in rare instances, non-slutty) girl flirt with this obvious moron of a guy across the food court, or other stereotypical teenage hang out. And I don't necessarily mean just silly teenage girls, either. I mean "women" in their 20s. I thought after the teen years, women were supposed to settle down and know their place and all that happy shit. Apparently not. I know I've said it many a time before, but it just seems ass backwards that girls can shamelessly lead some guy on and taunt him all to hell but when a guy does it, oh no, the end is near. Now don't give me the usual excuse of "well, girls are harmless and men can damage someone emotionally by leading them on". No. Actually, men and women are quite equal in the world of causing emotional disaster. Women may actually be more evil than men.  Evolutionary theory would, in some way, dictate that after these many thousands of years of men and women co-existing in the same world, day in and day out, this constant little tiff known as the battle of the sexes would subside. It's quite simple, really. The penis is  equal  to the vagina. And vice versa. Men couldn't exist without women (in most cases), and the same is true for women. Hell, if one gender just disappeared, there would be no human race after a hundred years or so. So, why all this bullshit between men and women? Are we still that fucking primitive, that the only way to solve some little catfight is to claim one gender's superiority to the other? Besides, there's really no reason to constantly fire up the opposite gender because you have some insecure little notion that men/women are out to get you. Come on, people. 4 in 10 marriages end in divorce. You know why? Stupid, petty shit. Such as cheating. Hell, if people would control their urges 38% more of the time, men and women would be a lot less awkward around each other.   Oh, and another thing, thanks in part to Rie, and in part to my own little discovery. Love is a fun word to throw around at small office parties and other public venues to garner the needed attention to keep your ego inflated, and it is a really cool notion. You know, sharing a life together, having kids, etc. But so rarely does it ever materialize. The majority, perhaps around 3/4ths of all said couples "in love" is nothing more than lust, and this primitive urge to make the relationship last, even if it's obviously crumbling quickly. As hard as it has been for me to do, and everyone else, I'm sure, just let it go. There is more than "the one" woman for guys, and likewise for women. Hell, you just might encounter 6 or more "the ones" in your life. So don't act so superior because your boyfriend/girlfriend "loves" you. Because it's probably not substantial.   And, one more thing, going back to the first paragraph-y, if women and men ever want to be on the same level (which is, too, a nice notion, but will most likely never happen), both genders need to cut the hypocritical, victimization bullshit and accept each other as they come. Women like to use their supposed superior will and intelligence to do the following regularly: 1). Change their attitude based on a trivial occurance in every day life (ie- I broke a heel, therefore, I now hate you) 2). Flirt with hotter guys and act as if they've been offended if you ever so much as bring it up to them. This isn't always the case, but it is quite a lot. 3). Act shitty and/or sad toward you in order to gain more of your affection, preventing you from straying to other girls. This, too, isn't always the case, but yeah, it happens too much.  And as for guys: 1). Proclaim love to some girl they met 4 days ago, in a meger attempt to fuck her a few times and pull the "I'm not ready for a long term relationship" card. 2). Cheat, and cheat like hell. The same is true for some women. 3). Act entirely dense and unaware of a woman's needs.   And, no, don't tell me "men and women will always be opposites". No. You make it that way. True, women and men will never be exactly the same, but come on, cut the shit and be sincere for once in your fucking lives. And, if you do, you'll catch a lot less shit farther down the road, relationship wise.  Just a thought.

       Well, here tis again. School's coming up in a few days, and I feel utterly unprepared. I don't know what the hell to expect due to all the teachers I've never heard about. So...that should be fun. But, besides that, on the topic of girls. I'm tired of ranting. No one cares, and I'm beginning not to, really. Ranting has never done shit. I guess it's just the way of life. Girls just don't really give a shit about me, as much as I do for them.  Irony, however. I'm 100% sure if I ever announced the Arty special (ie- I'm gay), girls would swamp me. Why? Gay guys just  understand  girls so much better. So, I ask you, what bearing sexual orientation has on anything. Gay or straight, the difference is null. Everything I do and say now, wouldn't change if I were in fact gay. So what's the deal? Girls just want something to bitch about. So, anyway, I am in fact going out with this girl tomorrow night. So what's the point of this post? I know nothing will come of it, except maybe a temporary fuckbuddy. Please, clue me in, what is my problem?
