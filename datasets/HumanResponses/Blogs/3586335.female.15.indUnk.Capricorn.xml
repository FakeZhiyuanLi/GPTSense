      When you find someone what do you think of him/her? Do you look at them and think only what they look like? Or  do you try to talk to them and get to know them? do you hide from them so they won't notice you? Or do you show off in front of them? you try to get them but you fail you want to  be with them so  bad that you would do anything just to be with him/her. You fail then you find someone new  but it's hard to tell that if they are true, you just want to hold them close and never let go like a person with money it burns a holes in his/her pockets. Love isn't true and sometimes it never last.

      My mother With all my love for you; Who can have another? With everything you do; My best friend, My mother.  With the great job you have done And all your heart; To heaven you must run. For now we must be apart.  Don't worry about me; For the meaning of life I know. To be the best you can be, For you taught me this so.

      When I was a child I didn't really have many friends I was short, not that smart, shy, and didn't know anybody, or I didn't try to know anyone. I had a babysitter that I would call my best friend cause she was like a nanny to me she stayed with us and would comfort me when I was sad and hurt. My sisters where not really people that I wanted to look up to cause my sister Shannon would scare me and my sister Wendy was to busy with all her friends and boyfriends. When my babysitters boyfriend would come over in the morning we would go to McDonalds. When my babysitter had to leave i didn't know what to do. i had no friends and I felt like no one wanted me there. I just had no friends until i hit 3rd grade. Her name was Krista Talley and i will never forget her in my life.

      Why should we be judged just because we are girls? Where good at something but the males don't think so some of the time, most the girl I know can play basketball really good, just the boy don't think so. So they don't past the ball to females, only cause we might mess up or miss a shot we're there to play and have fun, and some just to show off, but we don't desever to be treated like the way we are treated. In this upward bound program i'm in most the girls don't play bastetball cause we know we won't get past to, but i really think it should change. What do you think?Â¿

      This story explains about a woman who wants a wife of her own, so she will have someone to take care of her too. A person to attend her every need, like a man watching football but except their stories. A person to clean up after you and the kids, someone to tell what to do when you want something done.

      Their are so many places to go to college. I thought u wanted to go to a college called Cotty in Neveda Missouri. I got the info. from my neighbor Martha, she was needing help to move one day so i decided to come and help her move. She asked me where i wanted to go to college i told her about my swimming and my cousins how i want ed to be near them she told me that there is a college named Cotty in Neveda Missouri.(which is where my cousins live) I thought about it and told my mother and she told me that is where she went to school at. She told mew it more of a prep school kind and it was a girls only school, so i told her no thanks. A few months later I found out about a school in Texas that has a great swimming program.

      There is one word that other people tell someone else but they don't mean it. You say it to the one you want to spend the rest of your life w/, some people say it so they can get w/ the other person there w/. Some people take it seriously and think that person really wants to be w/ them, but they don't. I've heard it to many time and people don't mean it I'm tired of hearing it, so if you don't mean it don't tell it to someone. The word it LOVE it hurts to watch it end and it's exciting to watch it begin.

      Girls look in a guy and want the perfect guy. But I hate that, I  want someone opposite of them, but I want one just like me, and some girls want a guy that their parents will like but I'm not one of them either I want one that isn't afraid to be him anywhere he is one that will call me once in a while but not all the time. Someone that isn't afraid to tell me what to do or wont be afraid to hang w/ me once in a while kind some bad but not like crime bad. It's just I've been a goody goody girl too long and I want to live me life how I want to. It shouldn't be my parents choose on who I date. I'm the one dating him and I hate it when they get in w/ my relationships but they only think of my safety it's like they think I can't handle myself I hat bein the baby of the family. i never get to go to places like in JC or ogden they won't even let me go to down town manhattan. They never let me go to parties, but it's all goin to change now. ok so i got off track but i want a guy like me and well i want a bad guy in a way but you should know what i mean.

      When you look to the sky you see bright glowing things everywhere, and it may not happen to a lot of you but when I look into the sky and see them it hits my heart and makes me start thinking of things like what I want in my life and how I have been treating someone special to me. When I started thinkin about him I started to cry cause he didn't need to be treated like that cause all he did was like me. I have a weird way of flirting but some people think I'm pushing them away, far enough that they think I hate them, but I'm not at all.
