        urlLink Daily Times - Site Edition   Ok.  I feel vindicated. I've said it before and I'll say it again, you never know what you gonna get when you breed these days it seems.  After living in Los Angeles for a few years, it seemed almost too casual to get plastic surgery to fix your 'flaws'.  With shows like "The Swan" making it seem like a prize to get hundreds of thousands of dollars of plastic surgery, trainning, and coaching.  It seems now that a man has divoriced his wife after she had an ugly baby.  So now in addition to having a blood test, we need affidavits declaring we are who we are or listing any work we have done to modify our bodies.    I kinda agree with some of this.  Marriage is more than about just Love.  It's also about looks, a breeding partner.  You just don't want to have sex and babies with just anyone.  You want someone free of genetic abnormalities.  Bad teeth are warning signs.  Awkward body parts can be warnings about mutations, or just screwing your sister a few too many times in their family history.  It's just too much apart of the selection process for finding a great mate that you'll want to spend your life and have children.

       It tough.   When will the product be finished. When can we start testing? When can we sell this thing. You said we would be done in March 2003 :)  That's my favorite. haha. I was foolish. I still am.

       There's just something good about Indian food. The vegetables are delish, and the meat is great. Spicy Cool and soft Naan. I'm hungry. Lunch is soo far away.   ok, well, 1 hour 13 min. but I'm withering away. Can't you see?

       Well, I'm not this old yet.  Went for a drive yesterday w/ a 80+ year old man.  I've never feared for my life as I did that day.  Crossing lanes of traffic, blinkers - what are they good for?, getting on parkways at 20 mph, going from 2nd to 5th..  and about that.  Old folks should move from the stick to the automatic, just for reactions sake.  But the best for last...  "Can you find me a parking spot to pull through.  I hate backing out.  My last 2 accidents were from backing out."  Jeeze.

       Ok, so somedays I feel older and somedays, I just feel old.  So I had a great time last night!  Went over to Rob and Becky's house since they were throwing their "Come as a Porn Star" party.  Courtney and I dressed as a doctor/nurse pair and we won the best dressed couple.  Let's just say she was hot and I was just arm candy.  But really, both of us started drinking around 7 and by 11:30, we were just tired, no buzz.  Don't get it.  She claims this never happened to her before.  I tried to console her with comments like, "it must be just the stress", or "did you get enough sleep this week?".  Maybe it was from the house hunt all day Saturday.  I did find an interesting home though.  Large rooms, wide halls, and a private backyard, but it is a garden home and I'm not thaaaat interested in those but eh, this is my second foray into the housing market here in Birmingham.  I'm excited and get that way when I see a house w/ a neat feature, but I'm soo lucky to have Courtney along w/ me because she can see through all the glittery sparkles and moving flashes of home buying for the crap the house really is like...    Hopefully next weekend will go well and the future more defined.

       He's so quiet and reserved...  but tonight, frantic. It seems that he got his paws wrapped up in a elastic cord that held one of his toys.  It wrapped so tight around his kitty paw that it cut off his circulation and in fact, he wanted nothing to do with me fixing it.  So off to the ER for him...  Well after he was sedated, no problem the vet said.    It was great though.  When we were trying to get it off ourselves, he meowed and cried...  so much in fact that his sister, Belle, came up and bit Courtney in the back a few times defending her brother.  It was sooo funny.  poor guy.  Well, all is better now.  Here's a picture of Belle when she was a kitten.  So much mischeif. http://mycathatesyou.com/newshowcat.asp?CatName=belle_080202

       This is the second school I've lost and I just don't know what to do about it.  Maybe I should just stick to Mammals. That's it, the rule doesn't count unless it is a mammal.   My cats are still alive. Yes. Alive and well. Crazy, but alive.  There's still hope for little Rickies.

       I hate it.   Driving home I had this fantastic link between September 11th and other attacks that have happened and a Tom Clancy book written a few years ago and it was lost to the ether as I listened to a song on the radio.  Hope it was worth the mindless daze I enjoyed as I drove home. Another idea died.

       The check is in the bank. I worked at Octigon for over two years and nothing is the same anymore, except for   urlLink belle  and sebastian.  So I traded my office for a cubicle. No more plants yet. Proffesionalism is in... Shorts are out.  Dion is gone.   That's a relief. I never knew how much frustration I had to live with on a daily basis until he left two weeks ago.  My days at work are now soo much more enjoyable, it's actually a pleasure.  Everytime I would step near him, I could feel it inside me well up and then subside as I walked away.  I would go out of my way not to have to step near him just to stop these feelings.    Well, that burden is gone and I'm glad.  For the first time in a long time, all I can see are great things now for the future. It has been a long time coming.

       There's a girl, I know. She's the one I dream of...      Ha, she just stormed off into the bedroom to console herself in another roll of toilet paper.    The sick.   They are so cute, especially with a gallon of apple juice in arms.  She demands that I take back my offensive comment. oh. haha. You should have seen it.  An empty bottle of  APPLE JUICE flew through the air at me, striking my chair. So cute.  If only these silly boys understood the sacrifice that us girls make for their happiness.....I suppose they never will though...but one can dream.  SACRIFICE!   I came home in the middle of the day to pleasure her with treats, lunch, and my COMPANY!   Showered with gifts, my green thumb, tastes in music (AND YES Screaming Girls Are Music), what is there ever to be angry at?  especially with that green blanket.   it should sheild your back from every harm, dagger, and bow!  Well, enough silliness for tonight I suppose.  But there's a lot going on these days. Stress about what are my next steps?   Pay off my debt or buy a home?  time to crunch some numbers. just nervous. loan was ok. prequalified was eh.  just so much to do. and not just for myself anymore.       she looked into my eyes, take me to the clouds above.

       I sat down with the man that will dertermine my immediate future today. The mortgage guy :)  He'll tell me Friday how much I can borrow to buy a home. I'm terrified. Here's a guy that will look at all my debt, what I pay a month, and what I make a month and let me know what I am worth in terms of a loan.  If that wasn't enough, then there is actually trying to pick out a home! Where should I live?   Calera Cahaba Heights  I dunno.  It weird.  Something that I think would be absolutely aweful, someone enjoys.   Garden homes.  eek. Town Homes, even worse. Condo? ha.  I want my space == privacy. My tomatoes need their room to grow beautiful fruit. I'm just looking for someplace that is comfortable to start a family.  life is good. I turned 26 yesterday. I played bingo last night. Practing being old.  Moved to the new office.   urlLink SunGard  bought the company I worked for and was a shareholder which is enabling me to buy a home too.  It reminds me soo much of my last job w/ Context Integration.   I've been soo excited about it, but so tired too. I've worked very hard and am amazed at how much my surroundings and the people around me affected my productivity. I liked the startup feel of Octigon, but I feel like I'm really going to make a different at SunGard developing Octane8.  Lots of Change for me this past year. Memorial day was a week or so ago. I remember driving back from Chicago that Monday.  Everything is different now. But life is still familiar and comfortable. I can't wish for anything more.

       I'd have to say that lately, I've definitly feel like I'm missing something.   I don't take the same enjoyment from things as I have in the past. My records are collecting dust. There are no hardwood floors in the apartment. The converstation just don't seem to have the same depth.  I've tried to find the spark I had in the past for some of these things but it's just missing.   There has been the home search that I've now put off for another year. The new job is very demanding and has added a great deal of pressure to my daily life. I need to do this right because of the potential that exists within the position can give me a great toe-hold to what I want to achieve...  but I need to learn a lot in the mean time.  I think some of this being I have to leave the past behind to get the future I think I want. No more indie-pop? I miss Mates of State.  I had fun belting out those lyrics...    "And when I stand here alone  I know speaking comes easy to you but I choke  And when I stand here alone, I know this  I know that since I'm leaving so soon  I owe what I know"  I just want to be that cool guy with good music, great converstation, and a fantastic leather couch. Maybe one day.
