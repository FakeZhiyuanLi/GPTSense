      Some things will just drive you crazy.  They haven't a clue what causes Hodgkin's (although they do know it is a breakdown in the immune system, cause unknown), but there are some patterns about people who get it.  1) People from ages 15 to 30 and people over 50 get it most often.  I'm age 46, and we know I've had it for at least 4 years.  So I've had it since age 42.    2) People who have aids and people who have had mono (the kissing disease), get it alot.  I've never had either one of these.  3) Men get it more than women.    4) People who live in hygenic environments may get it more than others.  This certainly has never applied to me.  I mean like get a clue, I currently live with SEVEN dogs...:o)  5) Guesstimates are that only 3550 women in the USA will be diagnosed with Hodgkins in 2004.  1320 people will die of it this year too.  6) One of the highest Hodgkin's mortality rates in the country is in the Northeast quadrant of the state of New Mexico, where I have lived my whole life. This is an area with clean blue skies, fresh water, no pesticide usage (no farming), no factories.  Just rural, beautiful, and quiet.  Hmmmm..  7) For some reason in the last 5 years, more women in their 40's are being diagnosed with Hodgkin's, but again they haven't a clue as to why.  In the dog world, they now think that over-immunizing our pets may cause cancer.  I keep thinking about all those polio vaccines, etc. my age group got when were kids... Hmmmm....

      All of those rumors you hear about this test being terribly painful ARE true.  First they give you a big shot of Demoral and another "happy" pill.  They do this because otherwise you would go home immediately once the pain starts.  With it, you are happy to make jokes with the staff and tell them how wonderful they are, even though you don't know them from Adam.  Next, they deaden your skin and muscles so you won't feel the huge needles going all the way to your bone.  The problem is there is no way for them to deaden the feeling in the bone when they siphon out the marrow along with a piece of your bone.    It takes 20 minutes and you can feel shooting pain unlike anything you have ever felt.  Without the happy pill and the Demoral there would be loud screams.  With it, your fingernails only leave permanent etchings in the exam table.

      The tests were pretty impressive; I especially liked the brand new PetScan.  This test scans your body for live tumors.  They give you 2 injections - one is radiation and the second is glucose.  Cancer tumors apparently love glucose (sugar), so the glucose goes straight to the tumors.  The radiation attaches itself to the glucose and shows them up on the scan.  The scan only takes about 30 minutes and you lie still in a Star Trek type tunnel.   What's really cool about this scan is it can detect whether the tumor is living or dead.  For those of you who read Lance Armstrong's "It's Not About The Bike", you may remember they did brain surgery on him, only to find out that the tumor in his brain was already dead.  That was good for him, but if they had the PetScan back then, he wouldn't have needed the brain surgery in the first place.  It's an expensive new tool, and in my case, the PetScanner was in a mobile unit that drives around from hospital to hospital, complete with a doctor on board.  One day my PetScanner was in El Paso, and the next in Albuquerque.  It is sort of funny going to the hospital and then stepping out back in your scanning outfit to find the trailer with the PetScanner in it!

      Finally done with all the tests!  In the last week I've had a lung capacity test (that turned out bad), a bone marrow test (that really hurt; although I have discovered Demoral is my friend), a cat scan, a muga test, and a petscan.  Some of the tests involved injection with radiation; I'm now wondering what color the flowers over the septic system will be at night????  Won't get the results until June 3!

      After surgery, we found out I have Hodgkin's Lymphoma, nodular sclerosis type.  This is a very treatable kind of lymphoma, when detected early. Is letting it grow for 4 years early?  ha. ha.  Finally got to meet with the Oncologist.  I like her a lot and she was very encouraging.  We also went over my x-rays.  There is a HUGE tumor in my lungs - it extends from top to bottom and takes up over half my lung on one side and over a third on the other side.  She put up a sample x-ray next to mine.  "See how the lung is all black on this sample x-ray?   See how yours is white with black around the edges?  The white is ALL tumor."    I laughed and said "I can't believe I'm still standing."  She said, "It shows how strong and adaptable the body really is."  There were also two other tumors, about the size of my fist - one on the lower right lung and one on the upper left lung.    Then we looked at the sideview x-ray.   This x-ray showed my trachea is severely bent out and is compressed to half of its size from the pressure of the tumor.  The x-ray report also states that the tumor is wrapped around my heart and all major blood vessels going into and out of my heart.   She scheduled a zillion tests so that we will know exactly how advanced my cancer is.  I guess when my primary care physician said my collarbone lymph gland was nothing, she didn't have a clue what was growing in my lungs for 4 years...

      Dave and I decided we'd do lunch at Maria's in Santa Fe after what would certainly be a boring doctor's appointment back in April.  At my last appointment the doctor said I probably had an asthma-type condition, but he ordered a ct scan and a chest x-ray anyhow.  I was certain he would tell me I had allergies.  I did have a swollen lymph gland on my collarbone, but I had that for 4 years and my primary care physician had repeatedly told me that was nothing.  The doctor came in the room and I was in my usual good mood.  He was very serious.  He told me that I had lymphoma.  He told me lymphoma was cancer of the lymph system and that mine was very serious.  He said my lungs were full of tumors and that the tumors were surrounding my trachea.  We scheduled surgery for the following week.  He was very kind; I was very brave. But when I saw Dave in the waiting room, I ran to the car where I immediately burst into tears.  We didn't go to lunch at Maria's...

       urlLink    Bobbie's Puppy&nbsp; urlLink     Only a true friend would pack up her 6 adult dogs, 4 puppies, 89 year old mother-in-law and travel 4 hours round-trip just so I could hug a puppy!  But that's what my friend Bobbie did for me on Saturday.  I can't tell you how great it felt to hug the puppies in person! (See picture above) Thanks Bobbie!  My friend Anne also has brand new little sammy puppies and she has a webcam setup so I (and everyone else) can watch the new babies.

      I'm feeling back to mostly normal today; I think the chemo takes about 7 days to get out of my system.  I also still feel really weak.  I had hubby Dave cut my hair really short today.  I still have it, but it is falling out.  I keep finding hair everywhere and it is getting really annoying.  But there's no bald patches, so I guess I'll try to keep it for the time being.  Dave is a GREAT barber and we used the dog scissors.  Of course, the dog's scissors are the really GOOD, expensive scissors made just for hair - unlike the cheap scissors we usually use for ourselves!  :o)

      Ahh...back from the dead.  Yes, what a roller coaster ride this is.  The doctor's felt my last bout with chemo (when I ended up in the hospital with severe pain) was caused by the massive chest tumor breaking up.  As they explained it, there are a lot of dying cells; this is very painful for your body, not to mention what your body has to do to get rid of them.  So I am viewing last night's episode in which I drank probably 5 gallons of water, as a very positive thing!  Here's the difference between the dog list and the cancer list.  On the dog list people get their panties all ruffled battling about whether a Samoyed's shoulder angles should be 45 or 42 degrees.  On the cancer list this week, Andrea writes that her insurance has now reached $970,000 (thanks to Hodgkins) and the lifetime benefit for her policy is 1 million.  And here is one of my major worries:  The US Supreme Court's made a horrific decision on Tuesday which gave HMO's, NOT doctors, the ultimate say in what treatment you get.  The American Medical Association has strongly denounced this decision.  On the news, they interviewed a woman whose husband had a cancer like mine.  His HMO denied him a doctor-ordered stem cell transplant (like a bone marrow transplant but using your own bone marrow) that would most likely have saved his life and he died without it.  (This is a common treatment for Hodgkin's when chemo doesn't work with a very high success rate.)  If the chemo doesn't work for me, I too may need a stem cell transplant in a few months and I too have an HMO!  Please consider writing your congressman and asking that they get off their duffs and PASS the Patient's Bill of Rights which would virtually overrule the Supreme Courts terrible decision of Tuesday.

      I've always been on a lot of dog email lists, so when I found out I had cancer, I likewise joined the Hodgkin's email list.  One of the first emails I received was from a very nice retired man in Florida who said, "The chemo's not bad until the day when you are laying in bed wondering if anyone got the license plate number of the Semi-Truck that hit you."  Well, last night I met the Semi-Truck.  I was doing GREAT until 6 pm.  I remember barely making it to the guest bedroom (no way I could make it up the stairs to my bed.) I remember laying there:  "Ok, is my heart beating?"  "Am I breathing?"   "Do I have a temperature?"  I remember wanting water and the full glass was there on the nightstand, but I had no strength to reach for it.  I don't think they make bad enough words to describe how I felt.

      After reading the list of chemicals in the post below, you probably think I'm busy dying in bed, puking up a storm.  After all, the day after chemo is supposedly the worst day.  Actually, I just got done eating a great lunch complete with Ben and Jerry's Pistachio Ice Cream.  I feel phenomenal! I feel like I need to be doing something, like going for a walk.  I have no nausea and I don't even feel tired.  In fact, I FEEL GREAT.  I feel better than I've felt in a year.  As of yesterday, the doctor can feel NO lymph glands in my neck, and she can hear no fluid in my lungs.  Yes, the chemo is WORKING! (In fact, it's working TOO well, that's why the white blood counts were so low.)  Now for the big news.  Taking 3 chemo drugs that make you lose your hair, you would think I would lose my hair.  They said I would lose my hair for sure.  My mom bought me a phenomenal wig.  My friend Ginger sent me a great scarf.  The chemo nurses gave me two hats.  And my friend Anne knitted me three beautiful hats; wonderful hats; BEAUTIFUL hats packed with all the love that only a true friend can send.  Sigh...  Here's how my conversation with the doctor and chemo nurse went yesterday:  Me:  Well, I'm finally losing my hair!  See? (I pull on hair and produce several strands.)   Doctor and ChemoNurses (looking at each other):  That's not losing your hair.  What day are you on?   Me:  I don't know; Thursday will be 3 weeks.   Doctor and ChemoNurses:  You're not going to lose it then.  If it's not gone by Day 17, you don't lose it.   Me:  But you said I would lose it.    Doctor and ChemoNurses:  Well, you didn't.   Me:  What do I do with it; it looks terrible, I haven't cut it, waiting for it to fall out.   Doctor and ChemoNurses:  (Laughing)  It looks bad; go get it cut.   Dave says if I go get it cut, it will fall out for sure....sigh..

      I've always been the kind of girl that only had aspirin in my medicine cabinet.  :o)  Here is my list of cancer meds so far:  Predisone:  Taken before I started chemo.  Predisone SHRINKS Hodgkin's tumors.  Also makes you retain water and eat like a pig.  Neupogen:  These are the shots I bravely (with my eyes shut) give myself that increase white blood counts.  Sargramostim:  These are new shots I get to give myself this coming week to up my white blood count at a slower level.  Zofran:  Anti-nausea medicine.    Compazine:  Anti-nausea medicine.  Levaquin:  Antibiotic for low white blood levels.  Oxycodone:  For pain; I have not needed this one.  Benedryl and Tylenol:  Given before the chemo to prevent an allergic reaction that can cause your heart to stop.  Chemo: One IV drip bag of Bleomycin - causes hair loss, fever-chills, vomiting, and lung damage *the one Lance Armstrong refused to take*.  One IV drip bag of Dacarbazine - causes bone marrow drop, nausea.  One IV drip bag of Velban - causes bone marrow drop, nerve damage, hair loss and vomiting.  One IV drip bag of anti-nausea medicine which is packed with Predisone (see above).  Adriamycin - causes hair loss, red pee, and vomiting.  This drug is given by a slow big injection (very slow) because the nurse must monitor it.  If it gets ON your skin, it literally destroys the tissue. I asked her what it did to the inside of my veins and she said "you don't want to know!

      Just got back from my chemo :o) appointment.  My white blood count went from 600 (.6) to 9700 (9.7)!!!!!!   The decision was to keep the chemo at the same level (not reduce the dose!!!) and for me to continue with the shots that will keep the white blood count up!

      It's so hard to know what to do.  Overall Hodgkin's is a really treatable type of cancer, when caught early; in fact they figure that when caught early over 95% of patients will make it! But mine definitely wasn't caught early.  Without treatment, we know I had a 95% chance of being dead by next Christmas.  With the ABVD chemotherapy treatment that I'm on,  my odds are somewhere around 60 percent that I'll still be here 5 years from now!  There are other treatments out there - BEACOPP and Stanford V.  But the problem is, even though initial studies look promising on the other treatments (some claiming over 90% for advanced disease), they still have not been duplicated and the side effects themselves can kill you (for example, Acute Leukemia - which is not very treatable).  So I've opted for the tried and true ABVD.  So far it seems to be working.  After only one chemo appointment, my oncologist could only feel one small lymph node in my neck vs. multiple lymph nodes 2 weeks ago.  And I feel night and day better.  And based on my low white blood counts, it seems to be working too good.  Hate to see my blood counts if I was on stronger stuff.  Just hope I'm doing the right thing????   Comments anyone?

      Poor Mary.  :o(   Turns out my white blood count from today is too low for chemo.  White blood cells fight infection.  They said they worry if Hodgkin's patients are below 1500 and if other patients are below 1000.   Critical is 500.  Mine was 600.     So because this means I can't really fight anything if I get anything, I got sent home with antibiotics.  And I have to stay away from people. And I have to give myself shots for the next 4 days with stuff that will increase my white blood count.  Huge needle (or at least it looks very BIG to me!) I can't even give my dogs shots.  They made me give myself one while I was there.  Poor Mary.  So pending a higher blood count, chemo is rescheduled for Tuesday.  I told her I felt great and she said I always say that and that I am very stoic.  Sigh....

      Well ok I realize it might just be a coincidence.  But Thursday I really didn't feel good.  Then my friends Lynne and Annie came over with a box of chocolates.  Not just ANY chocolates.  But melt-in-your-mouth chocolates.  All day long I continued to not feel good, but I dutifully continued to eat my chocolates.  And, by Friday I felt great.  Future experiments are pending!

       urlLink    Desert Willow&nbsp; urlLink     Today is a great day.   When this all started, my oncologist told me that within a week of starting chemo, I would feel better than I had felt in a year because the tumors would be shrinking so dramatically.  I didn't believe her!  I also argued with her, explaining that I have not been feeling bad for a year!  "Oh yes you have; you'll see", and she gave me that all knowing smile.  But I will tell you, one week after my first chemo, I feel awesome.  (Yesterday was a bad day with lots of aches and pains).  But today is a whole new world.  I actually feel like doing stuff.  And since Wednesday I have not coughed once.  Not once.  I don't remember the last time I didn't cough.  I can't tell you how relieved I am and how happy I am to know this is working!  Today one of my favorite desert plants bloomed in front of my house so I wanted you all to see it too.  I have been loving the comments.  Rory and Imp are really BAD; they must be Samoyeds to post comments like that!  And Perry, I'm so glad you have decided NOT to shave your legs "in solidarity with me".  :o) I laughed so hard at that comment that I almost fell off my computer chair.  The next picture I post is going to be of me with NO hair!  Hee!

      One of the things about cancer is you suddenly have to make new decisions.  Things you never had to worry about before.  Legs for example.  Do I shave them or don't shave them?  Now that I have less than 7 days of hair left, it seems like a waste of a good razor.

      Ah...the wonders of chemo.  Did you know the reason your hair falls out is because the lining of your hair root is destroyed by the chemo?   And the reason people puke is because intestine linings are destroyed?  Ah...but as I found out, people are different.  I never puked.  No, I had a different problem.  My intestines just decided they didn't work anymore.  Three days with no action.  None.  Now having just come out of the hospital for chest pains, I learned what NICE things they do to you there.  And I sure as heck was NOT, under any circumstances, going back to the hospital for   this   problem.    So I did what any self-respecting person would do.  I gathered up the reading arsenal. In order, Reader's Digest, Sunset Magazine, the Samoyed Quarterly, and knowing I might be there for a long, long time, the Holy Bible.  Then I fixed a big pot of really strong coffee.  Off I went.  I drank 4 cups of coffee, read Laughter is The Best Medicine, Hot Places to Visit in Santa Fe, and Grooming Your Samoyed.  Nothing.   But then half way thru Genesis I hit pay dirt.  It was an explosion that rocked the canyon.  I was glad it only lasted a few seconds or it would have even made the Albuquerque news.  I ran from the bathroom, thrilled to have the 3 day saga over with, and so excited to share the news!  "Mary, I'm eating breakfast right now" was the reply.  Sigh...  I just didn't know how to add that flushing had no effect and now I needed my caregiver to help me find the plunger...  :o)

      Boy, the blog got a tad too serious there!  Sorry about that.  Today I am feeling pretty good and just think that first chemo is now done with!  Yay!  But now I am worried about protecting everyone else's feelings.  Somehow that doesn't seem like it should be my job right now, but apparently it is.  Sometimes I feel very sad, sometimes I physically don't feel good, and sometimes I feel worried.  I think that's ok; in fact, I think there would be something wrong with me if I didn't feel like that!  What bothers me is the people who seem to think I should be on some kind of ra! ra! cheerleader status with up! up! up! feelings all the time.  Believe it or not if I'm not up all the time, the chemo will still work and my tumors will still shrink.  Let me feel what I need to feel...  Boy do I have a great gross story to post from yesterday; I just can't decide if people could handle it....:o)

      Oopsie.  Ended up at the emergency room Friday afternoon and from there got taken by ambulance to the main hospital where my oncologist and her crew is.  They weren't sure what was wrong, but they did tests to make sure I wasn't having a heart attack and that I didn't have a blood clot.  I got to spend the night at the hospital and they let me come home late Saturday afternoon.  I am so tired....

      I think I owe a huge thank you to all those people who had chemo before me and yelled loudly about the bad side effects. And to all the scientists who mixed-up these great feel good concoctions!  Because I feel GREAT this morning.  Before they even gave me my first I.V. (four in all) of chemo drugs, they gave me a whole I.V. bag of anti-nausea drugs.  Then they sent me home with not one, not two, but THREE anti-nausea prescriptions.  The chemo nurse gave me great advice - "start taking these as soon as you start feeling nauseas, don't wait!"   Anyway, so far I've eaten a bacon cheeseburger, chicken enchiladas, apple juice and milk, and I feel awesome.  (You have to remember I went thru a whole month of eating nothing but Campbell's chicken soup and I've lost almost 70 pounds: I'm starving thanks to the steroids I got last week.) Of course, the chemo nurse already called this morning, and told me not to get too hopeful as it might change shortly!  :o)  Besides killing the nasty tumors, my chemo drugs have the following side effects:  Adriamycin:  Makes you pee red (put that in for my friends who like gross details), vomit and lose your hair.  Bleomycin:  Makes you vomit and lose your hair.  Lance Armmstrong didn't take this drug because it is hard on your lungs, but I don't ride a bike, so who cares?  Vinblastine:  Bruising.    Dacarbazine:  Vomiting.

      Well, the good news is that I now have finished my first chemo treatment.  It took 3 1/2 hours for all the i.v.'s to drip in.   The other good news is that my heart is working good, the lungs are working as well as can be expected, and my liver and brain are fine.  The bad news is that the PetScan showed it is in my bone marrow and spleen.  Also the two fist size tumors in the lung are actually in the lung, not in the part of the lymph system that is in the lung.   This puts me at Stage 4B, which is as bad as Hodgkin's get.

       urlLink    Ok, here is a picture of our strawbale house; yes, it really is made of straw.  The straw makes the walls very thick and keeps the house cool in the summer and warm in the winter.  The living area is mostly round with lots of great views.  The house is about 3000 sq/ft with high ceilings, curved archways, custom tile; overall a unique blend of New Mexico, Zen, and dogs.  There's a big deck upstairs and a big deck downstairs with a comfy hot tub.  You can't see it in this picture, but there's also a large fenced area for the doggies (for when they aren't inside snoozing on the couch) and a few other buildings, like a shop and garage.&nbsp; urlLink

      Today I feel really good (thanks to finishing up a week of tumor shrinking methylprednisolone), and tomorrow we will FINALLY get all the results.  I have my x-ray in my living room and I've been having lots of fun showing family members the massive tumor.  I've decided I'm going to call the x-ray place and find out if there's anyway they can turn it into a regular picture. I want to frame it.  I figure if I have a tumor bigger than Texas (threw that part in for my Texas friends Debbie and Pam), I sure as heck ought to be allowed to brag on it!  I could also throw darts at it.  Well, why not?  I'm also going to try to figure out how to post more pictures on my blog so I can show you all what a strawbale house looks like!

      I'm sure all cancer patients are scared to death to learn the results of their scans.  Hodgkin's patients really sweat.  Here's why:  Somewhere around 4 months, the chemo will quit working or maybe I should say "the cancer becomes resistant".  Chemo works best early on and eventually quits working.  Both doctors have been very concerned about the size of the tumor and the fact that the chemo may not get rid of it.  Both doctors said a stem cell transplant may be in my future.  To be in complete remission at 4 months, we figure over half of the big tumor must be gone in Tuesday's scan.  And it is a BIG tumor.  If it's not gone, my prognosis without a stem cell transplant is ZERO.  (The one exception is if there is just a small amount they may be able to use radiation which will buy some time.) 1/4 of Hodgkin's patients do NOT reach full remission at 4 months.  It's not unheard of.  And 1/3 of Hodgkin's patients relapse after reaching full remission.  Less anyone think a stem cell transplant is no big deal, know that you have high odds of dying during the 6 week hospital stay. You pack your bags, kiss your doggies good-bye, and hope you see them again.  And if you make it, your long-term odds are only 25% to 50%.  So, yeah, I'm sweating those results...

      My new doctor is from the University of Nebraska.  She spoke very highly of it and told me that two of the top lymphoma experts in the country were there.  She said if I needed a stem cell (bone marrow) transplant that would be a great place to consider because they do 600 to 700 per year. And that I might want to go talk with them in a few months.  Now I knew the University of Nebraska was good; my sister did her residency there. But I didn't know how good.  I mean it's just a little place in the middle of a cornfield, right?  WRONG!  It turns out they did the first stem cell transplant there in 1983.  And that the doctor who was instrumental in the new classification of lymphomas (what I have) for the World Health Organization is also there.   They are written up in US News and World Report as one of the BEST hospitals for cancer.  They are one of the three busiest transplant centers in the US.  The link to them is      http://www.unmc.edu/international/pages/cancer_who_are_we.htm  Well, I guess we learn something new everyday, the University of Nebraska...not just for football anymore!

      I've found another internet Stage 4B Hodgkin's friend.  Her name is Andrea and she is my age (almost 50)and lives on Long Island. She has gone thru treatment and is in remission.  Today we were talking about the "kids" on the Hodgkins list.  The Stage 1 and Stage 2 twenty year olds who say stuff like "I got my chemo two days ago and today I'm out ocean surfing and bar hopping."  Like it's no big deal.  We decided it really is TOUGH being OLD and doing chemo.  I never thought I was OLD though, until I had to do the chemo.  Hmmmm....  We both have found it takes about 9 days to get over the chemo; before you don't feel sick.  And then of course, you get chemo again in a few short days....This is, without a doubt, the worst thing I've ever had to do.  I can see why some people choose just to die rather than go thru it.  It is NOT fun.  Lots of controversy on the dog lists to keep me going.  Somedays I get so mad I turn off the computer before I post something really inappropriate!  My hair is becoming a real issue.  There is hair everywhere.  In my chair, on my pillow, on my keyboard, in my food.  But there's still lots on my head too.  I just don't know what to do with it.  I was thrilled to hear my cancer hero Lance Armstrong did it again!  Go Lance Go!  And if you haven't read his book yet "It's Not About the Bike", it is great reading.  It's all about his life with cancer, beating the odds, and then moving on...

      Overall I'm doing pretty good this time.&nbsp; I've learned to down the pain meds and nausea meds at the first sign of a problem and it really has helped.  And thanks to my friend Anne for pointing out (if everything goes as scheduled) that  I am now 1/3 of the way done with chemo  !!!!!!!!!   I have an appointment this coming Tuesday with a new doctor in Santa Fe. I'll let y'all know how it goes.

      I found out today that my cancer doctor adopted a new born baby on Friday.&nbsp; I'm thrilled for her, but she is also planning on being off work for 3 months to bond with the baby.&nbsp; She works with 3 other doctors.&nbsp; Another one is transferring to Houston this month, and a second going elsewhere also.&nbsp; That leaves ONE doctor for all the patients.&nbsp; I'm not thrilled about this at all.&nbsp; We did get an updated listing of other oncologists who accept my insurance, and the UNM cancer center is on it now, so I've left a message for them to call.&nbsp; I like my chemo nurse and am into the routine where I am at, but I don't think this sounds like a good thing at all!

      When I was talking with my Oncologist (i.e., cancer doc) the other day,&nbsp;I told her I was getting rather tired of all of this.&nbsp; She sort of casually commented "well, you have at least 5 months to go".&nbsp;   The more I think about that, the longer it seems.&nbsp; I really am sick of it.&nbsp; It seems like I get 9 bad days, followed by 4 good days. Then I get chemo again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yuck.&nbsp; And over and over and over again for 5 more months. &nbsp; I'm also feeling rather reclusive.&nbsp; &nbsp;My big activity in life&nbsp;is watering my garden.&nbsp; I have LOTS of tomatoes, a few green chiles, and&nbsp;cilantro.&nbsp;  &nbsp; We also actually bought a DVD player&nbsp;so I can rent movies for the upcoming week.&nbsp; I usually can't stand watching movies, but I'm hoping I can get used to it. &nbsp; Chemo day tomorrow; let's hope it's working.&nbsp;

      I'm actually feeling really, really good today!&nbsp; Yay! &nbsp; It's interesting following my fellow Hodgkin's friends on the Hodgkin's list.&nbsp; Bill in Atlanta&nbsp;was diagnosed Stage 4B two months ahead of me.&nbsp; He is already in FULL remission!&nbsp; And, he only lost 20 percent of his hair.&nbsp; Our cases, diagnosis, and symptoms, &nbsp;have been side by side very similar. &nbsp; Of course, other people with Stage 4B&nbsp;have not go into remission and are now awaiting stem cell transplants and they lost all of their hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm hoping not losing your hair is a good sign! &nbsp; By the way, if any of you still think people are lucky to have Hodgkin's, please read Missy's story at&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; urlLink http://www.angelfire.com/folk/palmetto/missy/

      Sorry I haven't updated the Hodglog for awhile.  I just have not been having a good time of all of this.  I have been having a lot of pain and we have changed the pain meds so hopefully this will get better.  I also feel very weak, and no, even though the TV commercials sound wonderful, Procrit will not work for what ails me.  I also sent one of my Samoyeds (Krissy) off to the Astroworld Houston Dog Shows.  This is one of my favorite shows, but of course, I don't get to go.  No, I get to stay home and have cancer.

      Finally back to being able to sit-up for more than 30 seconds.  The description "run-over by a semi" certainly does fit.  People have asked me to describe this feeling; that's tough.  Imagine being run-over by a semi and you are laying flat on the pavement and have no desire to get up because you hurt so bad everywhere.  Yep, that describes it.  Was surprised to open the mail today and find out that the shots I give myself cost $2700.  I'm not sure if that is for 1 shot or 4.  I guess I'll figure that out as more statements come in.  The cost of modern medicine!    On a side note, I got to meet my mom's new puppy today.  She is a Havanese and her name is Gracie.  Gawd...is she cute!

      Today is get hit by the semi-truck day.  Hard to explain this.  Flattened on the pavement sums it up.  I get a lot of questions about my treatment plan.  I will definitely continue chemo until the end of September when we will do yet another CT or Petscan and see how the tumors are doing.  If the tumors are completely gone(possible, but because the tumor in the lungs is so huge this may not happen), I will get 2 more months of chemo.  If the tumors are not gone, we will decide what the best option is.  The options at that time would be Option 1) Two more months of chemo followed by months of high dose radiation.  The bad thing about the radiation is that it can cause other cancers later on; Option 2) stem cell transplant.  What's a stem cell transplant?  It is basically a bone marrow transplant using your own bone marrow and takes at least a month-long hospital stay.  Everyone's body generates stem cells in their own bone marrow. (Yes, stem cells grow in your own body everyday, not just in a lab petri dish like we hear on the news.)  There are not very many stem cells in your bone marrow.  So they give you drugs that create more of them.  Then they "harvest" them from your bone marrow.  Each harvest time takes about 6 hours and they need to do it many times over a period of many days to get enough. They freeze it and save it.  (One hopes they do not have a power outage during this time.)  Then you get mega chemo; enough that it hopefully kills all of the cancer.  It will also kill all of your existing bone marrow.   Once you are now almost dead :o), they give you back the collected bag of stem cells and hope that it starts generating new bone marrow.  If all goes well, you are cancer free.  Obviously a lot can go wrong during the process; but if it works it is a very good thing.  They used to keep these transplants (which carry quite a bit of risk) as a last resort, and try other types of chemo and radiaton first, but they are now finding the sooner you get them the better.  The reason is that after awhile chemo quits working on your cancer.  By doing it early, your body is still receptive to chemo and it can kill the cancer.

      How exciting!  Although I've talked with 2 people on email who have Hodgkins Stage 4, I actually got to meet someone yesterday who survived it.  Turns out the big strapping, healthy looking, guy "James" who draws my blood every week had Hodgkin's Stage 4 and is still around to talk about it.  He did have to do the bone marrow transplant thing which he claimed was not too bad.  He said they don't do it in Albuquerque and you have to go to Arizona.     Chemo went fine.  Some people read, some people knit, some people sleep, but I spend my time in chemo talking with other patients.  Yesterday I met the nicest lady who is hoping to prolong her life to 6 months by taking 6 hours worth of chemo every 3 weeks.  Puts things into perspective...  Also, for those of you wondering, since I am giving myself shots to increase my white blood count, chemo should not ever be delayed again.  Oh yeah, and the doc did grumble a tad about my weight gain, but only because she had to recalculate my chemo dose.  I get more now! :o)  I also have a CT Scan sceduled for the end of July to see how much these tumors have shrunk.  Oh yeah, and yesterday I lost 3 more hairs!

      One interesting thing that I've noticed (and others have commented on also) is that cancer doctors don't have the same perspective on weight as would cardiologists.   In fact a recent well documented study showed that women who lost weight, and then gained it back, and then lost it again (well, you know...) had a significantly higher chance of getting cancer.  Reseachers  know  that while your body loses weight the immune system is lowered and they actually think that may be why cancer is able to sneak in!  Also, my doctor is THRILLED with my weight gain.  In fact she's rather proud of it.

      My attitude has defintely shifted.  I've gone from thinking I'm going to die, to deciding that this cancer was really, really stupid to pick me.  Tough old goats are not good cancer candidates because the cancer gets stomped to little bitty pieces.  Today is chemo day and I'm not worried about the chemo at all.  In fact, I'm happy to get the chemo.  What I'm worried about is getting on that darn scale at the dr's office.  I have gained somwhere around 15 pounds.  This might be because part of my treatment includes being on steroids which makes me eat like a horse/pig.  But it also could be because I lost 70 pounds because of the cancer, and now that the cancer is going, going, going...the weight is coming back.    I really did like fitting into those little tiny jeans...

      I posted to the Hodgkins email list about my lack of hair loss.  So far everyone claims they lose either all of their hair or most of it.  But one person actually posted that she didn't lose her hair until after her 3rd chemo.  My 3rd chemo is on Tuesday.  Maybe I'll get lucky?  See I have all these cool hats to wear....

      Now that I've calmed down, I remembered the doctor doing calculations on the tumor sizes and telling me it was MUCH better than the 1/3.  She then gave me the paper and told me I could calculate them for myself.  My friend Anne also brought up the same thing last night.  You see, the tumors are all down about 1/3 in width and 1/3 in length and 1/3 in depth.  As Anne explained, if you take a piece of paper and cut off 1/3 widthwise and then 1/3 lengthwise, you don't end up with 2/3 of the paper!  (And then you add depth in there too!)  So we went on the internet and found out how to measure volume; found it on a Middle School webpage :o) (plus Anne sent something similar).  So.....drum roll.....  So those nasty tumor beasts have had a volume drop between 39% and 67%!!!!   And the percent that's left is only 33% to 61%!!!!   Plus there's the thing about them being fuzzy right before they break up - the official word on the report is "much less solid appearance appearing more as an area of infiltrate."  Also, because my blood is FINALLY good this probably means the cancer is OUT of the bone marrow (which produces blood!)  On another note, I got in trouble at the chemo place.  I had met a new friend - "Velma from Truchas".  We were laughing and talking about our cancer and treatment and our kids and stuff like that.   Well, hurumpf, this grumpy old man threw down his magazine and said he couldn't stand our chatter.  Velma and I actually quit talking for a full hour out of respect for HIS cancer.  I finally had enough of that (I mean we have cancer too and we wanted to talk), so I told the nurse and she moved El Groucho over to the Grumpy Man Corner all by himself.  :o)  So Velma and I happily resumed talking, eating our cookies and crackers.  Her teenage grandkids even stopped into visit her on their way to see Ozzy Osborne in concert. :o)

      Overall good news.  The tumors (in my lungs and in my abdomen) are all down in size about 1/3, but the best news is that they are no longer solid appearing, only hazey.  The doctor said they usually appear hazey right before they break up!  (This was the first anyone had mentioned about the tumors in my abdomen although it was apparently in my ct scan in May. Grrrr....)  The doctor and the report said the improvement is SIGNIFICANT!  They do not refer to my huge lung thing as a tumor.  They refer to it as "persistent abnormal mediastinal soft tissue".  It has decreased in thickness about 30 percent.  The fluid in my lungs has decreased, but there is still "fluid or thickening" around the heart.   My blood results were also good with all results (including the anemia) now within normal range.  Since the anemia was caused by the cancer, this is GREAT news!  Since I got chemo today, I am going to bed now.  :o)

      I just got done reading the latest email on the Hodgkin's email list and I'm laughing so hard I think I might fall out of my chair.  Usually women post on the list and the women discuss things like "will my hair fall out", "can I still work while I'm doing chemo", "will I live or die"...you know important stuff.  But the last few days, the list has been taken over by the guys with Hodgkin's.  They are discussing how soon and how often after chemo you can have sex. I'd say some of them, no most of them, are even braggin'.  It is hilarious.

      If I had to guess I'd say this chemo is working.  Yesterday, I had so much energy I could hardly stand it - I painted the deck (two gallons of paint) and cleaned two large area rugs.  This morning I made fresh banana bread (7:14 am).   I haven't had energy like this in years....
