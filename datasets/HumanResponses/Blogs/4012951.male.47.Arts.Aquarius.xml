        Sometimes I have&nbsp;a crazy notion that runs through my head.&nbsp; It's actually more like a recurring question that&nbsp;puzzles me&nbsp;at odd times and places but&nbsp;usually when I see some otherwise taken for granted ingenious invention.&nbsp; For example, it happened this past Sunday as I sat in an Emergency Room waiting area (a friend had been bitten by a dog...) as I watched the automatic sliding glass doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;What a wonderful and convenient invention.&nbsp; A sensor detects your presence and opens the door.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;it hit me...What would Benjamin Franklin think of that?   I think of Ben and what he would think&nbsp;quite often&nbsp;when I&nbsp;hear the telephone ring,&nbsp;see airplanes in the sky or&nbsp;cars on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the idea of electricity (that covers&nbsp;lights, the radio,&nbsp;television, motion pictures...The list is endless), the concept of the internal combustion engine, the physics of flight...&nbsp; Just think of how much fun it would be to tool around with Ben showing him all the things we've manage to create.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you imagine&nbsp;explaining how man has walked on the moon?&nbsp;&nbsp;How would he react&nbsp;to hearing that we&nbsp;have a&nbsp;satellite circling, capturing data, recording it&nbsp;and reporting back to&nbsp;Earth from the planet Saturn?&nbsp; We have come so far and have so much.&nbsp; Ben would be very impressed with everything...   That's usually when another of my&nbsp;recurring&nbsp;thoughts hits me.&nbsp; He'd be impressed with all the gadgets and inventions but&nbsp;eventually he'd see&nbsp;what kind of society we've become.&nbsp; He'd be appalled by our lack of education in light of all the technological marvels.&nbsp; Sure, it took a smart person somewhere to figure out the concepts of the new technology...But look what we've given up in return.&nbsp; For all our efforts we have people that can't read and write...People that don't have or use their imaginations...People that can't think for themselves...People that are happiest doing&nbsp;no more than mindlessly doing nothing.&nbsp; Our Great Society has become stupid, ill mannered, uncaring and lazy.&nbsp; It's a shame really.&nbsp; And I'm certain that&nbsp;Ben wouldn't like it... &nbsp;
