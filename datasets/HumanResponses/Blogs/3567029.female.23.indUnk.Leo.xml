      Yesterday I did something a bit crazy.  I followed those silly text books about setting goals, and I did.  This is a huge step for me.  I'm just generally too lazy to actually do all the work involved in setting a goal.  But  yesterday I did it.  My goal was to save as much money as I possibly could between now and August 13th, my moving date, to buy new bedroom furniture.  My current bedroom furniture I've had since I was five years old. It's white, and made for a little girl...its time to grow up and get some grown up furniture.  And a bed thats not too short for me! So I sat down and wrote a budget for myself and created reasonable spending limits for myself.  And then after work I went to Crate & Barrell to look at all their insanely expensive furniture to motivate myself to save.  Looking at their prices made me go "holy crap! i can't afford furniture! i can't spend a dime!"  Though, I know I'll get furniture somewhere thats actually reasonably priced, it helped give me something to look forward to.  Flipping through Ikea's website helped too.  So wish me luck, and hopefully by the time I move in August I'll have a whole bedroom to live in in my new apartment!

      Last night I saw "The Chronicles of Riddick" in the theatre, this follows up seeing "Pitch Black" last week.  I have to say, I really enjoyed both movies.    Naturally they're not award-winning films, but they're very creative, and interesting.  If you're interested in seeing Science Fiction & Action, these are both great films.  Don't expect them to be believable, thats why their sci fi action flicks, but they're still great.  I also would reccommend seeing Pitch Black before you see Chronicles just because you know a bit more before going into Chronicles - though its not completely necessary.  It just helps a little.  Next up - I want to see Fahrenheit 9/11.

      This weekend I'm off to spend a day and a half with Daddy in Connecticut.  I lived in Connecticut for about five years when I was in elementary school, and I loved it there.  It's been a few yaers since I've been back there, and I'm looking forward to spending the weekend there again.  Especially since its just me and Daddy.  Of course, we're driving up in Daddy's bright yellow with black checkered roof MINI which just makes it even more fun.  In other news, I also have been dubbed at work today as someone not to cross.  I really can't figure out what took them so long to figure it out, but my co-worker today said "I've learned, Lauren is not someone to piss off."  I'm so proud that they've learned this.  Someone sent me a really asshole email yesterday and I wrote up a super sarcastic response refering to the "Common Sense" policy which can be found in the Finance Library on the second floor.  I didn't send the email to the jerkface that wrote it, but I did send it to my co-workers to enjoy.  They said it was sarcasm at its best.  It's been a good day.  And now that its 11:30, I'm leaving in one hour for the weekend!  Have a good one!

      Did you know that you can fly from Philadelphia to Bulgaria for only $600??  And that wasn't even me looking very hard, just a quick glance and its $600!!  Crazy!  So, now this means I definitely will be going to Bulgaria.  You might be thinking - why on earth is Lauren going to Bulgaria.  You also might be thinking - Of course Lauren wants to go to Bulgaria.  Where else would Lauren go?  Well it turns out that one of my kickass littles, Sarah will be joining my kickass Grandbig,  urlLink Frank  in the Peace Corps in Bulgaria.  I can't wait to go - I would love to experience such a completely different culture.  Plus, my travel bug has been itching lately for me to fly somewhere and I've been looking at flights to all kinds of places just because I want to go.  Orlando anyone?  Vegas?  San Diego? Bulgaria?

      Last night I enjoyed a very busy evening of eating ice cream and watching a movie.  But this wasn't just any ice cream, or any movie.  I went to this new ice cream place around the corner from where I live called Maggie Moo's.  First - its called Maggie Moo's.  Second, they had a big cow waving to me a few times when I was on my way home from work. Third, its ice cream.  I had to go check it out.  It's a pretty interesting concept - you pretty much make your own ice cream.  They have about 12-15 basic flavors and then about 15-20 "mix in's"  so you essentially create your own ice cream.  They scoop it out and then lay it on this cold board, put scoops of candy or whatever you want on it, mix it up, then put it back on your cone.  I decided to just test the ice cream though and got some kind of coffee in a waffle cone.  Dave got caramel ice cream in a waffle bowl.  It was almost $9.  I almost fell over when they guy looked at me and said "That'll be $8.42".  So..as cool as that concept is..its not that cool.  I also watched Pitch Black last night.  It took me awhile to get into the movie, but once I did - it was pretty cool.  The idea is just neat.  Of course there are no Oscars about to be handed out for this movie, but if you take it for what it is - a scary, science fiction, its not supposed to be believable, movie - it was good.  I liked it a lot.  Now, I can go see the Chronicles of Riddick!  Next up on my Netflix list is Wet Hot American Summer, as reccommended by  urlLink Steve .  I can't wait!

      This past weekend I went to my friend Ryan's house for his graduation party.  It was a great time! I got to spend lots of time with my long-lost friend Renee.  Except she's really not long at all, and she was never lost.  I just haven't seen her in awhile.  Ryan's parents are really great people and a lot of fun.  They did tequila shots with Ryan's friends, and just really celebrated and partied hard.  It was quite a bit of fun - I hope I'm as cool as them when I get older and have kids.  Plus, it was great to see Ryan and hang out with him.  Congrats Ryanfriend!  Now you can join me in the real world!

      I don't understand why its so important to some people to eliminate choice from others because they don't agree.   urlLink This  is a prime example.  There is no reason to remove Michael Moore's film from the movie theatre because some people don't agree with it.  If they want to encourage people to boycott this movie because they don't agree with it - be my guest!  But what right do they have to eliminate my choices just because they don't like them.  This applies to nearly everything controversial issue facing society today.  Prayer in school - the key is not to force prayer on anyone.  There is nothing that says you can't take time to yourself during the school day to pray.  But eliminating others choice and forcing any kind prayer time period and making those who choose not to pray to feel embarassed or coerced into praying is not acceptable.    Violence on TV - if you don't want there to be as much violence on TV, turn it off.  Television caters to what people want to watch, if they have no customers because their station shows programs that are too violent then they will alter their programs to meet viewers desires.  But because someone does not want to watch violence on TV does not give them the right to eliminate my choice to watch violence on TV.  They can turn the TV off.  I can't turn on something thats not there.  If the majority of viewers feel this way, then I will have to agree with the mass of people and not see the violence I desire. (Disclaimer: This is just to make a point.  I'm not saying I like to watch a lot of violence on TV.)    Abortion - I know that this one is touchy, but I'm going to take it on anyway.  I feel that because I have never been put in a situation where I have had to consider this choice, I don't have a right to tell someone else that their choice was wrong.  However - I do feel that if people do not agree with abortion they should educate those who are considering it, and advocate people choosing not to have an abortion.  Abortion will never be stopped.  People will travel where they need to travel or secretly hire who they need to hire to have an abortion if thats what they really want.  So why not allow people to do it healthfully without endangering themselves, and instead if you think that its immoral or wrong or gross or whatever else, change their minds.    See, I don't think society will really ever change their actions until you change their minds.  You can make anything illegal that you want, but that doesn't really stop it.  Case in point: drugs & alcohol abuse.  My generation has been educated since elementary school about the dangers of drugs and alcohol, and with that education came choices that I made as I got older.  I guess my major point is that forcing choices on people isn't the answer, and if you feel passionately about an issue, don't try to change laws try to change minds. That will change the law.  Plus, I just really hate censorship. But thats another blog for another day. urlLink

      Today, I gave blood.  Evidently if you spend too much time in Europe during your life you may get some crazy disease and then you can't give blood anymore.  I am two days short of the maximum amount of time I can spend abroad and still donate blood.  I can't say I really like this policy..so i've spent six months in Germany am I going to give someone Nazism??  I'm a Jew, does that negate the Nazism I could possibly give someone by travelling in Germany for six months?  Either way, the Red Cross makes these rules, not me, so abide by them I must.  While I was giving blood I saw a series of commercials from John Kerry and our genius with a capital J president George W. Bush.  Kerry's commercial talked about how every American should have healthcare.  Bush's commerical talked about how our economy has grown for the last 10 months, and how Bush is optimistic about our economy continuing to grow, and how Kerry is comparing the economy to the Great Depression and how pessism isn't going to get us anywhere.  The commerical ended with Bush saying "I'm optimistic about America because I believe in Americans." Beyond the fact that I think that the currently unemployed would like jobs, and not optimism from Bush his last statement was really an oxymoron.  I don't believe in Americans - they elected you and you can't even chew pretzels or ride a bicycle!  I know every President elected in a year ending in "0" has been shot, but Bush hasn't needed to be shot, he's doing a good job trying to assassinate himself.  My point is...of course Bush believes in Americans, they're stupid like him!  I don't believe in Americans one little bit - they need signs that tell them when its safe to cross the street and warning labels on coffee to tell them its hot.  Not to mention the warning label on my straightening iron "Do not use when sleeping."

      I'm 22, I've been out of college for over a year and working for just over a year now.  Yesterday I finally admitted that I was old.  I was listening to Counting Crows in my car with my 16 year old sister, and I said "This song was really popular when I was in high school."  She'd never heard it before.  And she had no qualms pointing out to me that that was a really old thing to say.  Then my little told me that I was a grown up.  But really now - I watch Sponge Bob!  And all Saturday morning cartoons!  Doesn't that count for something?  Please?

      This weekend I celebrated Father's Day a bit early, and took Daddy to a Fleetwood Mac concert.  He has a huge thing for Stevie Nicks, and well - I just want to be able to say I went to a Fleetwood Mac concert before I died.  The show was amazing.  I like Fleetwood Mac a lot.  As my last post said, I go to a lot of concerts.  Hands down this was the best guitar playing I've ever seen in my life.  Easy.  They are just so incredibly talented.  Stevie Nicks sounds just like she does on the albums and Fleetwood Mac, as talented as they are wouldn't be much without her.  She's definitely a little loco - but not nearly as crazy as Mick Fleetwood.  At one point during the show Stevie said "our next song came out on an album called Tusk, which was released in 1979."  My dad looked at me and started laughing and said "you weren't even born yet when this song came out.."  And I started thinking about mainstream music today and who among the top selling albums today would still be around performing 25 years later. There's no way that Britney Spears will have the lasting power of Fleetwood Mac or Stevie Nicks.  Britney Spears can barely sing, beyond that she's a plastic pin-up.  When she's 50 who will pay to see her stand on stage and lip synch?  Or what about Eminem.  Personally I think that he's very talented though I think its a push to call what he does music.  Artistic expression - sure.  But music? uhm....  I'm not a huge Eminem fan, but I can conjure enough respect for what he does.  But looking at him vs. Fleetwood Mac...he doesn't stand a chance.  Once the band gets that old, the only thing they have left to stand on is their music.  They can't really do acrobatics around on stage anymore and flashy light shows only do so much.  Watching Fleetwood Mac you can see the work that went into their music and how hard they're still working to perform it.  Eminem just talks really fast and walks around on a stage.  Britney lip synch's her "music" and performs someone else's choreography.  Hilary Duff doesn't even know what the heck she's singing about because she just got her drivers' license and she's too busy feuding with Lindsay Lohan to know much of anything about life.  And their music won't be much to stand on in 25-30 years.

      Uhm..I have no idea how I got wrapped into this, but I figured, what the heck. I don't have enough work, I might as well try to amuse myself somehow.  I'm not a computer nerd, I don't know anything about webdesign - though maybe this will motivate me to get more involved - but I do love to write, and I do have a lot of extra time on my hands at work so - here we go.  I've come upon a recent quandry with ticketmaster.  I love concerts.  Love them.  The pain of standing on your feet for four hours, not being able to hear anything for about a week afterwards, coming home at 2am smelling like things unknown - its great.  More importantly though, I love concerts in Philly.  Philly fans are insane.  When someone comes to town, they will get a reception like no where else.  Unless we don't like you- then you will be alone in a room all by yourself with your little guitar singing "Puff the Magic Dragon" to the sound director's two year old.  I've recently blown my entire bonus check on concert tickets for this summer.  But recently I've been going to see some smaller-known artists, whose tickets are a whopping $12.  Its more expensive to go to the movies than to see a live concert at that price!  But who in their right mind is going to buy those tickets off of ticketmaster?  $12 for the ticket, $4.50 for the venue charge (why thats not included in the ticket price beats me) and another $2.00 for 'because we're ticketmaster and we can' charge.  I think I would be less offended if the ticket price were just $20 and I didn't know all of that breakdown.  That, or I'd like to know the whole breakdown of that $12 ticket price too.  You know like $1 for tour costs, $1 for the venue, $9.95 for the label, and $.05 for the artist.  I've been lucky enough that these artists are small enough for me to be able to buy the ticket the day of the show at the door and save myself from having to pay ticketmaster all kinds of money.  Booo ticketmaster.  But then ticketmaster threw a wrench in my hatred.  A Fleetwood Mac concert I planned on taking my Dad to for fathers day was pushed back a week.  And I got both an email AND a phone call from ticketmaster to tell me what had happened.  Well damn.  How can I hate them now, I would've driven a whole freaking hour to Hershey if they hadn't gone out of their way to tell me.  *sigh*  So much for hating them that much....

      I am, by no means, a fashion guru.  Mostly because I never cared.  I don't like to look sloppy or slutty. Anything in between I wear.  I usually end up in jeans and some kind of colored top.  Recently I've been venturing into new territory looking at shoes a color other than black or brown and various belts to coordinate my outfits.  During my lunch break today at the mall I saw more girls than I can count looking like they just walked out of magazines down the red carpet and into the mall.  And by "girls" I mean..young girls. We're talking junior high-high schoolers.  How do they have the time to put into their clothes..and more importantly the money!  When I was in high school (all of six years ago) everyone got their purses from the Gap and that was cool.  Now I see girls with Louis Vuitton and Coach and Kate Spade (who I love by the way) and I wonder - what the hell?! I shoved things in my back pockets..not into Kate Spade?!  What is going on? Or did this always exist and I just didn't know it because I didn't care and I didn't know who Louis Vuitton was.  Much less Coach. Hmm

I mean. I love Krispy Kreme's sometimes, but they dont' come in a lot of flavors. I like variety!&nbsp; And sometimes I just really want a Blueberry Glazed from Dunkin' Donuts.&nbsp; What a dilemma....

      uh oh. Its my birthday this week and I'm not sure quite how&nbsp;I feel about that yet.&nbsp; I'm turning the big 2-3 which my boss teased me about.&nbsp; Mostly because I'm so freaking young.&nbsp; But&nbsp;I am getting old.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have four upcoming weddings this year: my best friend Steve, my ex-boyfriend Tim, my boy's sister, and my old roomate Marney.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess&nbsp;I can't be that young if all my friends are getting hitched! But also, the big thing about my birthday is that&nbsp;I hate it.&nbsp; Typically, its the worst day of the year.&nbsp; Not because&nbsp;I hate getting older but because of my parents.&nbsp; Since they're divorced there's always the "who gets to see Lauren on her birthday" debate and subsequent guilt trip no matter who&nbsp;I chose.&nbsp; Then there's the "lets have dinner/throw a party/celebrate - but on our terms with who we want and how we want."&nbsp; The second one is the one that hit me this year.&nbsp; One set of parents offered to throw me a birthday dinner and make me whatever I want.&nbsp;&nbsp;I asked for a pretty easy dinner: shrimp cocktail, corn on the cob, steak on the grill, a salad, and apple pie.&nbsp; Then they asked who I wanted to invite and then gave me crap for wanting to invite my boy.&nbsp; I know - imagine that!&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to share my birthday with my boyfriend.&nbsp; They just get all weird about it - they don't want to have to clean the house, or eat in the dining room, or have to be nice and talk to him and actually get to know him. God forbid he turn out to be a nice guy and they're wrong about him.&nbsp; So, Happy Birthday Lauren - as long as you do what we want. Though, this is far better than the year I got screamed at for not baking my own birthday cake or raking the grass fast enough on my birthday.&nbsp; And this year I'm getting a gift too - first one in three&nbsp; years!&nbsp; They're helping me buy my new bed..I hope anyway.&nbsp; I haven't really minded that - I don't expect gifts on my birthday.&nbsp; But I do mind that my step-mom has a conniption if I don't get her something for her birthday/mothers' day/christmas or anything else I'm forgetting.&nbsp; I guess I just hate the hypocritical bullshit associated with that part of my family sometimes. Okay, enough moaning and groaning.&nbsp;

      Okay. I admit it.&nbsp; I'm so excited about moving that I can't stop thinking about it, talking about it or doing things to get ready for it.&nbsp; It's such a frustrating thing to not be able to start packing because its entirely too soon but still know how much work there is to do before I move.&nbsp; So instead I just keep planning about it.&nbsp; Plus, I'm buying all new bedroom furniture which is adding to my excitement and brokeness but still excitement.&nbsp; So everytime I see a furniture store, I have to go in and poke around and see what I like.&nbsp; I'd like to slowly accumulate more/better furniture.&nbsp; For example, I found this really cool  urlLink coffee table .&nbsp; It lifts up so that you can eat off it, because we all know that we eat off our coffee table all the time.&nbsp; However, its $300 and I don't even have a bed.&nbsp; I should NOT be looking at $300 coffee tables.&nbsp; See what I mean? This brings us to yesterday when I decided that, even though our move is three weeks away I was going to call and set up our phone, cable and electricity.&nbsp; Good thing I did, too!&nbsp; They're all booked up for our move-in day, so we are getting our phone connected the day before and cable is queued up for the following week.&nbsp; Assuming the current residents cancel their cable - which they have not done yet.&nbsp; You move out next week people - you should be overzealous like me!

      I've realized that I spend the entire first half of my day waiting for lunch.&nbsp; Mostly because I tend to just futz around in the morning doing little things to keep myself busy thinking "hey! lunch is only two hours away!" and then I do the majority of my real work in the afternoon.&nbsp; But seriously, lunch is the highlight of my day.&nbsp; Its a whole hour smack in the middle that I get to do whatever I want with.&nbsp; Drive to the mall, go home and visit my sister, visit Dave's for a quick makeout session, meet up with friends, sit under my tree and read, go to the gym, the list goes on and on.&nbsp; There's a whole plethora of activities for me to choose from during this sacred hour of the day and most of my morning is spent trying to decide what do do with that time.&nbsp; Plus - I get to decide what to eat!&nbsp; Do I bring a sandwhich from home? Get a salad from the cafeteria?&nbsp; Go to the Chinese buffet up the road?&nbsp; Chick-Fil-A (NOT chika-fil Dave...) And then today it hit me: my life has boiled down to being excited about eating lunch.&nbsp; I think I'm the most boring person on the planet. Time to go back to reading CNN.

      It's been a busy weekend!&nbsp; First it started with a barbeque at my Mom's house to celebrate the sale of my step-dad's business.&nbsp; Not because my step-dad wanted to sell his business but because he wanted to be rid of the mother-fucking asshole who was trying to destroy him and steal the business from under him.&nbsp; All I can say about that is that I believe in Kharma and he too will get his in the end.&nbsp; And my mother will be telling his wife about the prostitute he hired while he was in Malaysia. The weekend then moved on to visit my friend Nick who I haven't seen in a while.&nbsp; We had drinks with his family and then we saw Fahrenheit 9/11, and then hit up our favorite restaurant from high school.&nbsp; Fahrenheit 9/11 was a fascinating film.&nbsp; I read the news every day, and I believe George W. Bush is incompetent just like the next guy - but this film surprised me.&nbsp; There was so much information I just didn't know.&nbsp; Granted: when watching this movie be sure to watch it with some common sense - its done by Michael Moore and full of his slanted view.&nbsp; The one thing I do wish Michael Moore had done was shown the flip side.&nbsp; It would have made his documentary much more legitimate if he compared his information about Bush to information about other Presidents.&nbsp; The statistics only mean something when they're compared to something else.&nbsp; It would have been a more honorable film if he had said "Here's Bush. Here's the other guys, now&nbsp; make up your own mind."&nbsp; The other thing I didn't like was the part about the woman whose son died in Iraq.&nbsp; It was important to see her pain, and how difficult it was for families who had their loved ones abroad.&nbsp; But I didn't like how she supported Bush until her son died.&nbsp; Either you're for the war or against it - but don't be for it until your son dies and then passionately hate Bush.&nbsp; Other peoples sons were dying there too and you supported it until your son died.&nbsp; I don't know if thats really what happened, but thats how it was portrayed in the film.&nbsp; However, that having been said - it was still full of information that I wouldn't have known to get from anywhere else.&nbsp; I would recommend it to anyone. Then last night I went on a date with my favorite boyfriend to Outback and then to see I, Robot.&nbsp; I loved I, Robot - it was much better than I expected it to be.&nbsp; Will Smith was fantastic in this film and it really was clever.&nbsp; Its a great combination of action and science fiction. And to top off the weekend, my best friend Steve proposed to his girlfriend Leah and of course she accepted.&nbsp; Congratulations you two crazy kids!&nbsp; And look Steve, you didn't need Dave's help to not fuck it up!

      I'm sure you have recently read the articles about how  urlLink Slim Fast will not longer be showing ads featuring Whoopi Goldberg  because of her recent statements at a Democractic rally against George W. Bush.&nbsp; What baffles my mind is why Slim Fast cares.&nbsp; They promote their product and so does Whoopi.&nbsp; They chose her as an a person to promote their product.&nbsp; Whoopi also has a life beyond Slim Fast and their ads, and she has a right to express her opinions.&nbsp; If Whoopi had committed a crime, I can see why Slim Fast would want to not have a criminal promoting their products, but for speaking her mind?&nbsp; Shouldn't Slim Fast promote every woman's right to an opinion and the right to express it along with their product?&nbsp; Isn't that the best way to say that they are indifferent?&nbsp; They cut Whoopi because they don't want to take sides in a political election, just as Walt Disney did when they didn't want to distribute Fahrenheit 9/11.&nbsp; But isn't this move decidedly in favor of George Bush? The same thing happened with  urlLink this  issue against the war with Clear Channel.&nbsp; Companies now regulate public opinion along with their products. Thinking about this I've realized that most of the companies who have tried to remove themselves from political debate have done so in favor of Bush.&nbsp; They haven't pulled anyone who promotes Bush and bashes Kerry.&nbsp; How many Kerry-bashers out there have been removed?&nbsp; Then I realized that there weren't a whole lot of Kerry-bashers out there.&nbsp; Certainly its not because there aren't very many Bush supporters - there's a country half-full of them.&nbsp; It seems to me that 1. Democrats/Kerry supporters&nbsp;should take the high road and talk about the issues - there certainly are plenty of them.&nbsp; 2. Republicans/Bush supporters need to stop pulling their wealthy strings and let people have the freedom of speech and make the election about issues and not gossip.  I would love to see someone run for President who says "Hey.&nbsp; This is who I am, this is what I think, this is how I'm going to vote.&nbsp; If you agree with that, then I'm your guy.&nbsp; If you don't, well then pick someone you like better."&nbsp; The election isn't about who's better but about who better reflects the views of Americans.&nbsp; I wish they could be more upfront and say what they really think instead of having to try to say what they think people want to hear.&nbsp; Being President obligates them to do what the public wants and not their own agenda.&nbsp; I think that Bush has not done this.&nbsp; I think his religion, and personal beliefs have been his actions in office and not necessarily an image of public opinion.&nbsp; I think he went to Iraq without support of the public.&nbsp; He's trying to pass the gay marriage ban without public support.&nbsp; The public says they are against gay marriage, but they don't want to amend the Constitution.&nbsp; He should try to create a federal law that defines civil unions and enables gay couples to have all the same rights as married couples.&nbsp; I don't agree with that completely either - but at least its a compromise that might actually work without sacrificing someones rights.&nbsp; Just use a different word than "marriage" and the conservatives will be happy.&nbsp; Most of them anyway.&nbsp; I wonder when they're going to realize that homosexuality has existed since the beginning of time and no matter what they do its never going to go away.  Sorry. I got distracted. Anyway...this is my ADD blog for the day. Have a great weekend!

      i haven't posted in a while..bad me!  but it's been a busy busy few days!  After my six hour four mile trounce in the rain for Ben Folds - which was totally worth it, by the way - I got sick.  And there's only one good way I know of to kick a cold: spend a day in  urlLink Hershey Park  and stay up half the night to watch Dave Matthews Band.  I'm not a huge rollercoaster person.  I'll ride most of them, but I generally don't really love it.  But Saturday was the best time I've ever had an in amusment park.  I rode all but three of their rollercoasters, and one because we just didn't get to it, we ran out of time.  Part of what made my time there so wonderful was because no one was pressuring me to ride the rides.  My boy was so great - he just asked me to stand in line with him and keep him company.  As a result there were a couple I went on because, what the heck - I'd already stood in the line.  I hate being pressured and then dreading the ride and then making everyone there hate you because they spend their entire time pressuring you.  We had a cute little picnic outside the park at lunch time, and then headed over to the stadium for DMB.  Which rocked.  As expected.  Then I got to call in sick on Monday and go see King Arthur.  Which also is a great movie.  It doesn't have anything to do with the tale you've ever been told about King Arthur, but I still really liked it.  I only wish they'd gotten more into the characters and developed them a bit better to make you really feel their pain.  Anyway - I definitely reccommend it.

      Last night I went to the Rufus Wainwright, Ben Folds & Guster concert, and it was amazing.  But first, let me tell you.  When they say that the concert is at the "Festival Pier" on "Penn's Landing" please know that the "Festival Pier" is a good mile and a half maybe two miles from Penn's Landing.  Because we parked on South Street and ended up walking in the rain those two miles to the show.  Then the show was almost four hours long, standing, and then we walked the two miles back to the car.  Muscles I didn't know I had, hurt.  We got soaked for the first hour and a half of the show, but then towards the end of Rufus' performance and before Ben came out things started to clear up, and I was mostly dry by the time Guster finished up.  Rufus is clearly a very talented artist.  His music is beautiful.  Though, I have to say its the kind of music you turn on while you're cooking or reading and just relax to it - not necessarily big concert kind of music.  Ben came out and he opened with "Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head" - as I predicted.  He played a lot of new music, and one song that was on the Japanese release of "Rockin' the Suburbs."  He also played a song for his daughter called "Gracie," which is also his daughter's name.  Rufus also came back out and played a song with Ben, it was a cover and Rufus didn't know all the words so he had them in front of him.  He has an amazing voice so it was great.  He started to play "The Luckiest" and then fucked it up and got confused and then people started screaming for "Rock This Bitch!" and he started making stuff up singing about being tired of Rock this Bitch so he sang "Rock out, with your cock out."  And then describing how some people may not have the right anatomy so they should "Hang out with your wang out."  Then Guster came out and played "Fair" with Ben, which was awesome.  It was just like having the whole Ben Folds Five back..but not quite as cool.  Then Guster played some background music while the crew came on and moved Ben's piano off - it was awesome!  Guster played a great set, and at the end Ben came back on and played a couple of songs with them.  He sneaked on and played the drums at first and then they brought his piano back out.  The sound for Ben's piano was all messed up at first and at the end Ben was like "I'm just here to take up all kinds of space and feedback all over your music."  It was pretty funny.  They didn't play any encore's which was sad, but they played an awesome show, so that was great.  It was totally worth the pain and dampness - I can't wait to see Ben again!  I'd like to see him again with just him, and hear him play a longer set.  He didn't play a few of the crowd's big favorites like "Song for the Dumped" and "One Angry Dwarf."  But his new music sounds amazing, and I can't wait for the new album to come out!

      In an hour and a half, I get to leave work and go see Ben Folds. If it rains like they're saying  urlLink here  I better get my money back.  I know it says 'Rain or Shine' but it says nothing about hail.   Don't make me get out my angry face weather gods!

      Today was my big presentation.  As I was preparing at some ungodly hour this morning it was the first time since graduation that anything in the real world seemed to resemble college.  I got up extra early because I didn't read or create my notes the night before, I was nervous, I made most of it up on the spot, and I used the term "big green meanies."  Oh yes, I'm in the real world and I used the term "big green meanies" in a professional business meeting.  Not just any professional business meeting, a professional business meeting with every major department head in Finance.  And the best part: I totally got away with it.  Mostly because I also used terms like "twofold" and "advesary" and "inclusive of overhead costs" and "meets UCC code Section 4 requirements" and "protect ourselves from fraudulent blah blah blahs." But also because for some reason I get away with this kind of stuff.  I'm not really sure why, but I do.  I pouted at my boss on Friday when it was 4pm and we were still at work.  What'd he do? Laugh and then tell us all to leave.  I lose $3million dollars and they say "don't do that again.  here, have $50." The CFO gives us a deadline I don't like and I tell him he's in "Big, big trouble, mister" and he pokes me in the side and walks away.  Who said business isn't fun?

      I hope everyone had a happy and safe 4th of July!  I spent the 4th fighting being sick, however there were some highlights from this weekend.  I washed  urlLink Bruiser  my favorite  urlLink Lemon . I watched fireworks from my parents back deck, I saw Spider Man 2, and I watched Wet Hot American Summer.  First, Spider Man 2 was great! I loved it, how could you not love it - its Spider Man!  It is sappier than the first, but still plenty of action.  I enjoyed it.  As for Wet Hot American Summer - that movie was hilarious.  This is pending the right sense of humor.  Granted I kept dozing in and out of the movie, but it was hard not to laugh at some of the great funny moments in that movie.  Thanks  urlLink Steve  for reccommending it!  Tomorrow will be the best day EVER.  I get to see  urlLink Rufus Wainwright ,  urlLink Ben Folds  &  urlLink Guster  at  urlLink Penn's Landing .  I would be going crazy out of my chair in excitement if it weren't for that huge presentation I have to give to every huge manager in the company at 10am tomorrow morning.  But come 10:30 tomorrow morning, all bets are off.

      Guys say girls don't make sense, but really its boys that don't make sense.  Girls are easy - we freak out for no apparent reason, get upset over nothing and we get angry and upset for the littlest things.  And while this seems to make no sense at all - thats what makes it work.  Girls are not logical beings, therefore when we freak out over nothing it fits perfectly into our character and we have met all expectations.  Boys, however are finicky fickle bastards who never make any sense.  One minute they're perfectly logical the next their emotional and sappy in an attempt to appease our romantic side.  But the most annoying thing about boys is how you can never get any kind of real information out of them. They're always cryptic and aloof about any essential issue relating to a relationship.  "Do you like me?" "See, 'like' is an objective term - how can i know if i like you if i don't really know what like means." What the hell is that shit?!  It's not rocket science!  Girls want only two things from boys: 1. Security 2. Sweet Sweet Loving.  By security I mean that girls want to know whats going on and whats going to go on.  If guys were to be upfront about it all, I really think girls might hate guys a little less.  I mean, if I guy actually come out and says "I like you a lot. But not in that 'forever' kind of way - lets just have fun."  Girls would be okay with that because then they at least would know what the heck is going on and they can be secure about how guys really feel.  Even if a guy were to say "I'm not sure how I feel yet - but I dig you."  GREAT!  At least then they know what the deal is.  Of course..that does take away some of the fun of not really knowing and waiting to see what happens.  The result: girls still hate boys because they don't make any sense.

      Yeah.  So, I get to leave in one hour to go start the whole moving proccess which will extend into tomorrow afternoon.  I'm very excited to be moving and only a little sad.  Strangely I'm not really sad at all because all my little complaints about where I live now will soon be alllll gone!  The bad news is that this two day moving proccess is going to take place in the thunder and rain, thanks to Bonnie and Charley.  Thats right.  I'm moving on Friday the 13th in the aftereffects of two hurricanes. Yay for being online at home (for the first time in over a year) in less than a week! yippee!!

      its been a busy week. i move on friday and i have to load up all of my stuff into the truck tomorrow evening into friday morning which means i've been packing like crazy. i talked to one of my old roomates last night and she was amazed that i was as packed as i am. i normally wait until the last possible moment and then frantically run around doing everything until i'm abysmally behind schedule in every aspect. however i only have my bathroom and the kitchen left to pack and some clothes from my bedroom. considering a majority of the things in the kitchen are my roomates'. and what made today especially nice was a co-worker gave me one of her homegrown tomateoes! it looks so yummy. i can't believe i used to dislike tomates. i think i'll be stopping on my way home for some mozzerella and basil to eat with it. mmm..yummy!! it should balance out my breakfast of french silk pie nicely this evening.

      Look at how smart our president  urlLink is : "Our enemies are innovative and resourceful, and so are we," Bush said.   "They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people, and neither do we."  I think for the first time since he took office, I finally believe something that he's said.  To cover up for him, Bush had to get an aid to fix things up a bit.  Someone who can actually speak English, perhaps..?  White House spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush's misstatement "just shows even the most straightforward and plain-spoken people misspeak."  "But the American people know this president speaks with clarity and conviction, and the terrorists know by his actions he means it," McClellan said.  Well, thats just funny Scott.  You're trying to tell me that Bush is "straightforward" and "plain-spoken" ?  Unfortunately those are NOT qualities I'm looking for in a President.  Perhaps "intelligent, honest, trustworthy, heartfelt" any of those would be better adjectives than your fancy way of saying "plan and stupid."  And he speaks with "clarity and conviction" yes he does..he clearly and convincingly tells the American public he's trying to hurt them.  And the terrorists certainly do know that because he's too busy with Saddam to chase after them.  I really just can't stop laughing..keep talking kids..you'll just bury yourselves...

      Stats on my upcoming move: 8 days until I move 11 more commutes to and from work 4 more days of work 20 complete dish settings for the new apartment 1 collapsing ceiling in existing apartment 0 bedroom furniture 0 boxes packed  yeah, i'd say that was a good start. i still need to set up our cable but we have electricity, and a phone number. Saturday we're going to sign our lease - which has an adjusted pet fee since they LIED to us about it and I had to pull out the big guns and threaten them violently with a polite letter. Tomorrow I'm going to try to find a cheap mattress and maybe a desk for my bedroom. An armoir and nightstands will have to come later. i'm so very excited! i can't wait to move out of the ghetto and into a pretty pretty apartment with flowers and trees and no noise or collapsing ceilings! yay!

      Can we please talk about how cool  urlLink this  is?  A group of big name artists have come together to tour in a concert called "Vote for Change" to raise money to support a group called America Coming Together.  They're basically raising money to oust Bush.  I love it.  Plus, its a cool show, I wanna go!  Springsteen, James Taylor, the Dixie Chicks, Dave Matthews Band, Pearl Jam, John Mellencamp, and more.  Whoo hoo!  So. who wants to go with me?

      so. last night was an interesting night.  beginning with the conversation with my dad regarding my car and the fact that it sucks and the crappy deal that volkswagen offered me for it.  i'm going to court now, which should be interesting.  then, as i'm talking to my dad, i hear a loud dripping.  the bathtub directly above my bathtub in the apartment above me is leaking. a lot.  so i freak out hang up the phone with my dad and call maintenance.  the conversation goes like this:  "hi, my name is lauren and i live in apartment 123 in complex abc and.." "hold on!  we need to get some basic information first!  whats your name?" "uh. lauren." "where you do live?" "complex abc" "what apartment?" "apartment 123" "okay. now. what seems to be the problem?" (please note at this point i'm annoyed and my ceiling is sort of..sagging..where the bathtub above me is.) "the ceiling above my bathroom is leaking and it looks like its going to collapse." "ohh-kay. let me just type this in here...(clicks away)..alright. i'll call maintenance and they'll be out shortly." yeeeah. i go upstairs and tell the lady to turn off her bathtub and the leaking stops. i call back maintenance and tell them they can just come in the morning because the leaking stopped. and they said they had called the guy half an hour ago already and he was on his way.  half an hour later the guy shows up.  (please note, now its 11:30pm and it took him an hour to get there. and he lives 15 minutes away he tells me. hmm...) he pokes his finger at one of the spots where the water's coming through..and his finger goes straight through the ceiling.  nice.  i only live here for 10 more days! couldn't it have waited another week and a half to start trying to collapse?! nooooo my apartment just has to be a bastard for one more week.  *sigh* then my roomate comes home. his dad had triple bypass on monday and now he's having a panic attack and thinks he's dying.  the doctors say he's doing great..but he thinks he's dying because it hurts.  the man had open heart surgery!  i'm just glad he's okay right now and i hope he gets better because i sure would miss him if he decides to go somewhere. now, its after midnight..so much for packing. i move in 10 days..i should start that soon..hm.

      My roomate is obsessed with  urlLink Lance Armstrong .  OBSESSED.  He has Lance posters,  Lance screensavers, Lance's book, and of course,  urlLink Lance's yellow band  along with every single magazine that has done an article on Lance in the last few years.  As a result, I've learned quite a bit about Mr. Lance Armstrong, and I've been reading his  urlLink book , which I can't put down.  I've decided that I want to know some of the more recent information  (I need to get my hands on his  urlLink second book )  so I did a few searches for Lance to see what else he's been up to.  Amazingly I ended up mostly on personal web pages where people have been debating Lance's morality, his values, his priorities.  Especially following his divorce and now relationship with Sheryl Crowe.  And it's kind of pissed me off.  Let's get a few things straight about Lance, right now.  First:  Lance had an amazing fight with testicular cancer, with only about a 3% chance of survival and he beat the odds.  With tumors in his testicles, lungs, and brain its amazing he even survived - much less survived to come back to competing in one of the most grueling sporting events in the world.  What makes him admirable is that he worked so hard to get through all of those things.  His fight, determination and courage are all enviable.  As for his personal life - he married Kristin (Kik) Richard after he had finished his chemotherapy and was in remission.  They started dating a few months after he finished chemo, and married less than a year later.  They divorced after five years of marriage and three children.  He's been criticized for turning away from her after all the support she's given him and for sticking by his side through cancer.  Not true.  He was dating a woman named Lisa who stuck by his side through cancer, and after it was over their relationship ended.  According to his book she was the one who suggested seeing other people and he had no objections.   As for judging him for his divorce - the only offical press releases from him and Kik have stated that they separated and went through marriage counseling and came to the conclusion that their marriage was not going to work but a friendship would.  Lance has even said that their friendship is stronger now that they're divorced.  Based on other press releases from Kik it sounds as if the pressure of immediate celebrity along with the long time spent apart is what put the strain on their marriage. Now.  None of those things make Lance a bad person or a cheat or anything else.  His marriage wasn't working anymore - just like 50% of other marriages in the US.  People have criticized Kik for undergoing In-Vitro to have his children because she's Catholic.  Thats ridiculous - Lance is sterile because of his cancer, and they had to use sperm banked before he began his treatments or surgery. Lance has also been accused of doping.  I have NO IDEA how people can continue to say this.  Look at the man - he's all muscle, but he's still very slim.  If he were on steriods, wouldn't he be huge?  That aside - he's been tested regularly, more than any other cyclist and every single time he's tested negative.  How on EARTH can people accuse him of doping if all of the tests come back negative.  Thats just poor sportsmanship if you ask me.  Even his accusers have been quoted as saying that all of their evidence is circumstantial.  And Lance is quoted as saying that that was incredibly stupid of them to say while in the proccess of being sued for false allegations against Lance. I don't really understand why people can't say "Wow!  Lance Armstrong is amazing.  I really admire his accomplishments and look up to him for what he's done for cancer and cycling."  Instead people have to look for ways to bring him down and make him seem like a bad person.  He's just that - a person!  He has his flaws, he's not perfect - reading his book you can tell that he has his arrogant moments...and he knows when he's being arrogant too.  But don't we all?  I have a real issue with the people who have to bring him down to make themselves feel better.  How immature is that?  At the very least stop spewing crap when you don't know anything about it.  At least have read his book before you make a judgement of him. And thats my rant about Lance Armstrong.  For a good summary on Lance, try  urlLink this website .  Its pretty accurate

      I've been getting some slack at work about my evilness.  First of all, I take that as a compliment.  The fact that people fear me at work is a good thing.  But they are viewing me as evil for the wrong things.  I'm a pretty fair person, I try to view things from someone else's perspective when I start to get annoyed at them and see if I'm justified.  This is especially true in any kind of customer service situation.  I am a stickler for customer service.  If I'm paying for it- I expect it to be pretty good.  If its not awesome, I just leave a smaller tip.  If its horrible, I leave about a quarter to show them that I did not forget I just thought they were wretched.  Every now and then something really irks me and I write a letter to upper management.  In all the letters I've written only once have I not received a response.  I recently wrote a letter to my new apartment complex because they told us one thing about the pet fees when we viewed the apartment, and after we paid them non-refundable money they changed it by over $500.  Thats a lot.  I got a pretty quick response (after a couple of nudging phone calls) and it was fixed.  Now, Maggie Moo's has pissed me off, big time by not letting my friend use their restroom.  So has The Cheesecake Factory - more because I want free cheesecake and I'm on a roll rather than they've made me that angry.  Does this make me a heinous bitch, or just kickass because I have the patientce to write letters and get free stuff?

      Well! That was one way to bring in August with a bang!  First, HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my friend Kerry!  She turned 21 over the weekend and of course this meant partying hard over the weekend in DC.  Despite the crappy service at the restaurant, and an asshole manager at Maggie Moo's who wouldn't let us  - paying customers - use the bathroom, we had a great time.  I got to see all the lovely people I haven't seen in ages, and party with my girls.  Then I got to go see The Village last night.  It is a great movie - I really liked it a lot.  It's so clever and well-thought out.  It's a lot of fun.  Plus, it was filmed right in my back yard.  By "my backyard" I mean about 5 miles up the road from my backyard.  Close enough.  But before you go to see The Village - don't go into it thinking that its a scary movie.  It's not.  It's not really supposed to be, either.  Its just an interesting story that has some creepy moments.  I think they need to change the advertising on this movie because people go into it thinking its a scary movie and they're disappointed when its not, and the awesomeness of this movie gets lost in between.  Oh, and you know how they do all those ads to tell people to turn their cell phones off.  How dumb do you have to be to watch that and then NOT DO IT!  *sigh*
