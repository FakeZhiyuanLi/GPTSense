      Tony Tony Tony Again!  Yep once again "the mouth that roared" causes issues -- this time in Sonomo. Spins out at least 3 guys, including Brian Vickers.  And then after the race attacks Vickers while he's still belted in his car with his helmet on?!?! Stewart starts yapping at Vickers, while Vickers is like "What's your problem, you spun me out?"  Last year Busch needed a little fellow driver justice (from Jimmy Spencer) but Tony spun Vickers out!  Nascar is still waiting to announce the penalty and this time it could be very severe.  I think that most people have had about enough of Tony's antics.  His souvenir sales should start taking a hit.  It was one thing for him to have run-ins with reporters at a race but attacking a defenseless 20 year old rookie is another.  Brian Vickers should get some credit, he's handled himself very well.

      Well another race ending under caution.  That was no one's fault but it ruined the ending.  Kasey looked like he was gonna catch Ryan and make it a photo finish.  Finally the 88 has a good finish and so did the 38!  Next week road racing.  In Indy, Ralph suffers a bad hit but is all right. Montoya disQUALified!  Oh and Schumie won.

      Oh and what's this nonsense about leaving the Driver's meeting early?  Can't sit still enough to listen to the Pres?  Tony needs to settle down.  Start RESPECTING the leaders/elders of the sport.  Nascar penalized him by leaving early, rear of the field for the start.

      Whoa!  Somethin' else.  These guys know how to mess it up!  Kenseth should have been penalized more than Harvick.  He spun him out under caution!  Ron Fellows was on WindTunnel last night. Awesome!  He is such an accomplished racer.  I wish the Toronto media would notice him and give him the air time he deserves.  Maybe he likes it that way, he can go out in public and no one knows who he is.  A second in class at LeMans after all that trouble is amazing.  I'd like to see him win a Cup race to add to his trophy case.

      Schumy does it again.  Big whip.  Some controversy though BMW and Renault get disQUALified.  BAR's Button does well.  US Grand Prix next week.  These guys ain't used to racing so much.

      TSN has set up a partnership with Nascar.  Nascar Canada.  We need a track worth a race.  Not gonna happen too soon.  At least if we can get some visibility of the sport up here.  People will realize how great it is.  Maybe the TO sports news bunch will learn how to shout "JUNIOR"  And mention who wins a race instead of talking about some lousy nil nil tie in soccer.

      Does it again.  Even though the race sucked!  Jimmie was so strong he overcame a "goof up" by pit road control.  The pits were closed, no wait they're open.  Too late for Jimmie.  He had to go all the way around again to pit.  Came out 6th.  Nevermind he won under caution.  28% of the race was caution laps.  The TV audience will either nap or just plain tune out.  Gotta fix that.  Poor DJ strongest run of the year top 5 maybe 3rd.  But the new Ford engine failed him.  Work on it boys, he needs better finishes.  Ease up Michael - Rusty's brakes failed.  Robbie Robbie Robbie - at least it was Newman.  Kenseth deserves a large fine, points loss, and probation.  Spinning a guy out under caution is dangerous and uncalled for!

      Well Edwards ran too long on old tires and finished short.  He did make up about 4 spots in the last 20 laps though.  Setzer wins again - first repeat winner this year.  LeMans is under way.  Hometown fav Ron Fellows miscalculated a corner and ended up in the wall.  At least they got 23 hours to catch up.  GO Vettes!!!!

      Almost time for the Trucks in Texas.  Fast trucks.  Speed Channel at 9pm.  My pick - Carl Edwards.  Now that Brendan isn't there to win it.

      This week is Pocono - 2.5 miles of superspeedway-Road racing. It's a beautiful setting for burning rubber.  I look forward to Pocono - I was at a race there 2 years ago.  Highly recommend.  I look for Mayfield to do well.  Maybe it's Bobby Labonte's turn this week though.  F1 is in Montreal - I hope Schumy does another brake test during a caution so he can get knocked out.  Look for BAR to win.

      That's 2 weeks in a row, winning from the pole.  Jeff Gordon won from the pole in Sonomo and now again in Daytona.  Awesome runs for the Hendricks teams.  DEI still out performed everyone but 2 so they don't need to be down on not winning.  That move Jr. made near the end three wide pass from the top was one for the history highlight reels.  C2 who?  Only Kurt Busch got airtime and they still didn't mention the sponsor.  Lots o' bucks spent by Coke to no avail.
