      happy Easter to you, oh reader.  Well, I've gotten this "blogger" system up and going on moggey.co.nz so I figured I might as well add an Easter post! hmm well what's new at the moment? Its Easter weekend, and well.... I'm gonna have a mellow one. No rest for the wicked though, I'm gonna be at Weta on the Easter Friday and Monday...    More Video Nasty links   Okay, Easter could also be a good time to put out some more video nasty links, and also to take the time to send some shout-outs to those whom we met and worked with on the (ongoing) project:  Darin, you rock dude! great tunes and Phil and my self feel pretty damn fortunate to be able to work with you. Can't think of a better musical base to create animation mayhem to. Bring it on. Cindy Lee, although we haven't met in person yet, cheers to you too, respect YO! Hamish Bell from Australia, you da man, cheers so much for being on board and going hard building that Nastyville, we can't be doing this shit without you. Same to you Jayne.  Also our crew here, Phil, Greg and Corie. Phil, the freq head is coming along awesome, and Greg, ditto for the "meth" artistry on that body model. Corie, your help on the dreadlock-dynamics is invaluable to us, thanks.  and thanks to everybody for helping develop a cohesive design for the city and character. Even though this stuff IS still in development, I feel the need to thank everybody now given the success of the show at Fabric. Choice guys. :)  now for those links:   urlLink FreQ Nasty @ Fabric:   and more  urlLink Video Nasty Experience:

      Okay so this page might appear just a TAD out of style with the rest of moggey.co.nz, but please bear with us - I'm still getting to grips with the system... am working on customising the code to fit in better with the moggey style, watch this space.

      Phat controller went resonably considering the shit weather although We did end up in a bit of finacial strife at the end because of the terrible communication between john and aidan and the fact that it didn't sound amazing in the main room. God knows why. bar sounded fucking primo tho. :)    anyhoo we sorted it and at least we know for next time to get an actual proper promoter.    so as for DJ'ing at the moment I'm working on my next Pvans mix CD. This is a dark one featuring heavy, heavy dark choons from Deekline, Freqnasty, Darquan,  Search &amp;Destroy, DJ Hype, Skool of Thought, Aquasky Vs Masterblaster and many many more fucking massive body popping choonz.    total fucking rwkuss breaks 4 your listening pleasure.    also, Pvans will be playing for Freq Nasty, our mate Darin's gig along with the video nasty crew at sandwiches in the next upcoming months. Stay tuned for broken beats.

      I,Robot is finally out now, so Phil and I went to check it out on friday, and yeah - it was quite good, actually.  So why mention an apparently random Will Smith blockbuster on the moggey blog? Well it just so happens that Weta Digital did alot of visual effects work for this movie, although Phil scored a place in the end credits and i didn't. Weta were only allowed to put so many credits in the film, but hey, thats show buisiness.  Gutted? nah, the reason for this is even though the mocap studio at Weta DID work on this movie, it was only really a little bit, you see the bulk of the I, Robot mocap was done by those fine fellows over at  urlLink MA Studios , last year when we were finishing up work for the Return of the King.  So anyhoo.... we went to cinema, paid for a ticket (gasp!) I wore my I,Robot "Weta vfx crew" hat and checked out the film... Weta Digi reprazent y0!

      Well, I finally got round to cleaning my car again this weekend, theres always something nice about washing your car, its kinda like a good excuse mindlessly get out in the open air (especially if you live by the sea) and feel like you are doing something productive.   Plus, you kinda get an award by your car looking cool... lol.  so to immortilise this relatively rare occasion, i thought i'd play around with the camera and take a couple of photos.       ps. will post holiday photos soon!

      So last week i went and bought the new album from the Streets, Titled "A Grand don't come for free"; and there is always one thing that impresses me about this guy, and that is his poetic rapp-etry. (is that even a word? beats me)  Heres an example of a touching little track near the end of the album, which seems to re-confirm the notion that yes, women really do rule our world.  recommended. check out his first album too.  -----  In one single moment your whole life can turn 'round   I stand there for a minute starin' straight into the ground   Lookin' to the left slightly, then lookin' back down   World feels like it's caved in – proper sorry frown   Please let me show you where we could only just be, for us   I can change and I can grow or we could adjust   The wicked thing about us is we always have trust   We can even have an open relationship, if you must   I look at her she stares almost straight back at me   But her eyes glaze over like she's lookin' straight through me   Then her eyes must have closed for what seems an eternity   When they open up she's lookin' down at her feet     Dry your eyes mate   I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up   There's plenty more fish in the sea   Dry your eyes mate   I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts   But you’ve got to walk away now   It's over     So then I move my hand up from down by my side   It's shakin', my life is crashin' before my eyes   Turn the palm of my hand up to face the skies   Touch the bottom of her chin and let out a sigh   ‘Cause I can't imagine my life without you and me   There's things I can't imagine doin', things I can't imagine seein’   It weren't supposed to be easy, surely   Please, please, I beg you please   She brings her hands up towards where my hands rested   She wraps her fingers round mine with the softness she's blessed with   She peels away my fingers, looks at me and then gestures   By pushin' my hand away to my chest, from hers     Dry your eyes mate   I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up   There's plenty more fish in the sea   Dry your eyes mate   I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts   But you've got to walk away now   It's over     And I'm just standin' there, I can't say a word   ‘Cause everythin's just gone   I've got nothin’   Absolutely nothin’     Tryin' to pull her close out of bare desperation   Put my arms around her tryin' to change what she's sayin’   Pull my head level with hers so she might engage in   Look into her eyes to make her listen again   I'm not gonna fuckin', just fuckin' leave it all now   ‘Cause you said it'd be forever and that was your vow   And you're gonna let our things simply crash and fall down   You're well out of order now, this is well out of town   She pulls away, my arms are tightly clamped round her waist   Gently pushes me back and she looks at me straight   Turns around so she's now got her back to my face   Takes one step forward, looks back, and then walks away     Dry your eyes mate   I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up   There's plenty more fish in the sea   Dry your eyes mate   I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts   But you’ve got to walk away now   It's over     I know in the past I've found it hard to say   Tellin' you things, but not tellin' straight   But the more I pull on your hand and say   The more you pull away     Dry your eyes mate   I know it's hard to take but her mind has been made up   There's plenty more fish in the sea   Dry your eyes mate   I know you want to make her see how much this pain hurts   But you've got to walk away now.

      This weekend, Saturday the 17th of July we will be seeing Phil (Pvans) taking to the decks with the Hordak crew for The Phat Controller - apparently the last party to be held at the Studio Nine venue i believe.  All the more reason to see you there!

      Okay, looks like an apology is in order... before Phil and i left on our journey three weeks ago we hyped up the fact that we would be posting updates on our adventures with pics and all.... unfortunately the reality is that in the whole time we were in England and Serbia we did not get a chance to get at a web-enabled 'puter for a sustained amount of time.... but never fear! at the moment i'm in the process of setting up a belated weblog of our trip... so hold tight for now - it will be up soon!  SHIT IT WAS A SWEET TRIP - WE CAN'T HARDLY WAIT TO TELL Y'ALL 'BOUT IT!!!! *grin*
