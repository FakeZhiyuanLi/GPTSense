         i'm feeling v.fresh currently after having a long bath. aghh... i feel rather sticky and so uncomfortable when i was in school...drenched with the smell of sweat... feeling rather sticky... and the stuffiness i was feeling made it worse(i tink u get my point, right??)      played badminton for pe... refused to play captain ball or floor ball cos i had a bad experience on it for a lot of times already. usually i'll&nbsp;be regarded as if i was invinsible. itz like i am standing there.... with no one bothered passing the ball to me even if i was standing at a gd position compared to the other team players--with no opponent blocking me. though feeling a mixed of hurt and anger, i pretended tat i didn't care. i didn't want ppl to sympathize and threw the ball&nbsp;to me out of it. some of them&nbsp;are chossy and&nbsp;chose to  ONLY  throw the ball&nbsp;&nbsp;to the members whom they like(as in they are buddy-buddy). some pass the ball onlt to whom they think will be able to play actively and help to acquire points for them.      Thus, thinking i am among&nbsp;those neardy-neardy... unskillful gurls who is only gd in studies, i was left out in the whole game totally. never did they once think that i was once in a netball primary school team. did they even bother to question my skills??? no they don't- instead they assume. to me they are just plain SELFISH!        &nbsp;    anyway, glad to hear frm my friends that the someone has found a new and fresh victim..... wishing gd luck to the new victim and may she be able to handle him....finally, &nbsp;my nightmare is over(i hope!!)

       today... had a heart to heart talk with a classmate of mine. on the way home... we clarified our doubt and shared a thing and two about our secrets.   i believe in her...&nbsp; i truly feel that she is one of those people who i can trust.... like my close friend,&nbsp; fiza.    it was really refreshing being able to share some burden with someone....   i mean sometimes...itz juz feel good to be able to get a second opinion about the problem you are facing.    &nbsp;  anyway.... in bio class today... it was pretty scary.... mr cho was rather in a bad mood...    i really really was frightened... especially when he threw his book in the fit of anger....    the topic he went through was genetics... one of the bio topics that i've not mastered. i was scared that he would call up mi register number and asked me a question that i have no idea of itz answer. and guess what??? he call up my number... and asked what is the difference between genotypes and phenotypes... i tried to guess it through...and i got it correct. my luck i supposed.....    &nbsp;  i got rather irritated with one of my friends today... i mean, i wish she'll be more responsible.... i dunno how long i can take the annoyance i feel about her.     &nbsp;   to me:

       yesterday, i just got into an argument with my dad. i ended up feeling v.irritated at his accusation. but i guess....he was really really exhausted after a long day at work and he was not in a good mood.       this week has been like an emotional rollercoaster for me...    sometimes, i think that my life is so tiring to go through each day. yesterday...while i was doing my homework... i suddenly became so frustrated and tired. it is as if my body has it mind of its own. on the other hand, my mind was in the 'OVERLOADED' status. when i received my mt o-level result last thursday.... i felt a sense of sadness and disappointment overwhlming me. initially...trying not to show too much emotions and thinking i had mentally prepared myself not to do well.... it became a waste. i eventually burst out crying when i get a hurtful sms from someone i really care about.      my classmate turned out all looking at me as i was the only one who became emotional. i just can't seemed to control it. the tears that flows down was not because i expected to get the grade of A1.... it just became i became a disappointment to my parents who has high hopes for me to do well. i was also disappointed as i know that i can do better than this and instead i wasted my ability....      i also received news about someone i know. though the news is not proven to be true yet it have been proved to made me feel scared...scared that reality about it will sets in... and i'll be in another big tangle of mess in it.... i just didn't want to go through the worry, the fightened feelings that i had gone through for about 6 months. i didn't want the relationship that i tought is based on pure friendship will turns out to a lie...      Yet... though i got a chance to know the truth...i rather not know. because i rather i'll be kept in dark about certain things in my life. it is not because i want to run away from problems... i just don't want to lose a friendship due to it... and ended up tring to break off all ties with him.    In my mind...i only know one thing....       he is my friend....

       i wonder what life would be if i had taken different choices in life. would my life be entirely better??? or would i be living a worse life???      though having curiosity over this matter, i know that there's no point in brooding your past... i mean--regrets will just take you to a world of sadness... so, i decided to make a vow that for as today... i would try to be forward-looking and treat my past mistakes and regrets as the road to maturity by which i could learn from it....      since yesterday....i have not been feeling too well.... been having a cold and luckily, a minor sore throat. i hope i will get well soon...since my oral is this friday. been spending my days... having a few revisions on chemistry and social studies.... and watching tv... and dvds....      tomorrow, school will then reopens as per normal... and my miserable life as a student will continue... the only thing that makes me look forward to school is meeting my friends back. anyway.. the mt o'level result will be out soon...this week.... feeling very very anxious and scared...a mixed of both....

      received some good new(s) and bad news today..... Good new(s)   mdm siti has safely gave birth to a pair of twin boys. reali realli happy for her....  my teeth are perfectly okay---after being checked by the dentist   Bad new(s)   mr tan (my new pe teacher) is joining sjab as a teacher-in-charge. omg... i was so shocked cos if u have been reading my past posts-you would have realized that i do not adore him...not even one bit...  gonna be involved in the evacuation program as a 1st aider. while, my other peer leader classmate(certified first-aider as well) are part of the rescue team.   i had physics test today.... a hard one....really hard. i was guessing my way through every questions hoping to guess it correctly. but--i dun tink i'll be able to get it correct.  anyway... today, i think i broke one of my friends heart. initially, i didn't intend it to turn out that way.... but i guess certain things are inevitable. you have to face the music and not run from it. i tried to tell her truth but i treasure the friendship that i have built with her since the last 4 years...so instead i tried not to be too direct.... yet it seems that she doesn't get what i'm trying to say.... or is she pretending not to understand....
