          I was looking at ESPN last night and they played a montage of interviews with Shaq and Kobe.    Shaq tried his hardest to stay diplomatic about his former teammate Kobe Bryant, but the reporter would not let up. Although he did not directly state that he thinks Kobe is a punk, he would not answer many questions, like    “what do you think of Kobe as a person”?              I found Kobe’s insistence that the reason why Shaq left is because the Lakers would not pay him enough so he had to do what is best for his family.    Kobe, why were the Lakers unwilling to pay the cornerstone of the team? I think Kobe is a Liar, he lied to his wife’s face so why would he have a problem lying to the fans.    I am not saying I think the man is guilty in his trial; He is a victim of a system, which assumes a black man guilty until proven innocent no matter what the law says.                          Kobe is disliked in the league, his game is respected because he has mad game, but people don’t like him as a person.    The main reason why people don’t like Kobe is because he acts like his better than the other players in the league.    Shaq said Kobe is a great player and could be the best player of all time even better than Jordan if he would play less selfishly, true.                         On a brighter note Vlade is back.    I have mixed emotions, I love Vlade, but why are the Lakers signing an over the hill center who long past his prime, it show the desperation of the Lakers front office to get player in the middle.

          I must preface my first post on this blog by saying a few things about myself, I am a life long Laker and also a huge Shaquille O’Neal and Kobe Bryant fan, through their performance they have brought to the city of Los Angeles a sense of pride with three NBA Championships.              However now I am beginning to question Kobe Bryant’s commitment to the Lakers, through his behind the scenes manipulations he single handedly ruined our prospects of winning a championship next year. He drove out Phil Jackson who is arguably the greatest coach in NBA history and Shaquille O’Neal the most dominant Center in league history.            And now the Kobe is trying to act like he had nothing to do with the destruction of our team. Today in an ESPN interview Kobe said if he were the Laker GM he would have done everything to keep the big man. Kobe is a lying liar (a la Bill O’Reilly, that racist is another matter); to lie so boldly shows what Kobe cares about himself, Kobe you are not the team. I have grown to like Kobe over the years and have defended him against Kobe haters and those who would question his moral character.  Not Guilty!!  But that is besides the point Kobe should be jailed for destroying the team. I am no longer a fan of Kobe           Why keep Kobe? He opted out of his contract despite the unquestioned Laker organization and fan support. You can say that Kobe was just trying to get more money, but then why would you entertain serious offers from other teams. There is no coincidence that Kobe immediately signed after Shaq was traded away.           For those of you who feel that Shaq is to blame for his own departure, think about this. How is Shaq supposed to feel after the Lakers talk to the media about how Shaq is up for trades but also stating that they would do all they could to keep Kobe. All of this despite the fact that Shaq was the only one to perform during the playoffs and he is has always been the finals MVP, he carried the team while Kobe got all the hype.     Why keep Kobe over Shaq?     I am not a Kobe hater cus I hate no one    but when you start destroying the Laker’s playoff hopes you got to go son
