      Wow! Two blogs in the same day! Not Bad! I just finished Astronomy class for today. Astronomy is, um, interesting, to say the very least. I learned yesterday that all life is made up of stardust. I was surprised. I asked Stacie, which is what this open-minded community of scholars I'm in has to call her (we're not allowed to use our teacher's last name because she is a "scholar" along with us. Go figure.), what she thought about the Bible, creation, and Christianity. She said she believes in "god", but she is open-minded about it. She then proceeded to tell the class that the Bible was only an interesting mythology book. I was, needless to say, quite angry. I went to the men's bathroom afterwards and just stood there praying and telling myself, "Think happy thoughts. Think happy thoughts." for about 15 minutes. Then today, she announced that the only reason she likes winter at all is because the constellation Orion is visible, and it makes her feel good inside to know that he is watching over her. Uhuh. That's nice, Stacie. Thank you for that helpful bit of information. I should edit a song by the Newsboys and give it to her when GSP has concluded. "... Orion is watching over you, as always, you are loved whatever you go through, he's right above you...". Sigh. I am praying that God can use me to be a shining light to brighten this spiritually dark place. Thanks for your prayers. If there were a song to describe what I want to be while I'm here, it would have to be "So Bright" by Superchic[k]. That's all for now.   Stand up, God gave you the gift of life It doesn't happen to you, you happen to life Stand up, do something with your light You're a a light on a hill, you're meant to shine so bright So bright, so bright, so bright, so bright, So bright, so bright, so bright.  - Superchic[k] - Last One Picked - So Bright

      Well, this is the start of my blogging career. Welcome everyone! I'm here at Eastern Kentucky University for the Kentucky Governor's Scholars Program, a five week program designed to brainwash the attendees into becoming good citizens, ie. people tolerant of everything but morality. I've been here for 5 days already! Wow! Time sure flies when you're being exposed to a bunch of liberal crud! I'm taking classes in Astronomy, which I sometime like to refer to as Evolution and Liberalism 101, and Creative Writing / Photo Journalism, which has (so far) been OK. I really don't have anything else to say at the moment.  I sought the Lord, and he answered me; he delivered me from all my fears. Those who look to him are radiant; their faces are never covered with shame.   Psalm 34:4-5 (NIV)

      Hey everyone! This is the best part of Monty Python and the Holy Grail. Very funny.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  The knights rush into a cave, huffing and puffing, to take cover from the vicious onslaught of the Killer Rabbit.     Arthur: RUN AWAY! RUN AWAY!!  Bedevere: Okay, how many did we lose?  Arthur: Well...Gawain...Ector...and Bors.  That's five.  Bedevere: Three, Sire!  Arthur: Three.  And we can't risk another try, that rabbit's dynamite!  All: Hmmmm..  Robin: Maybe if we attack it, it will get confused, and make a mistake!     (pause)     Arthur: Like what?   (longer pause)  Robin: Ummmm....  Lancelot: Have we got birds?  Arthur: (quickly) No.  Galahad: (brightly) We *have* the Holy Hand Grenade, Sir!  Arthur:  Of course!  'Tis one of the sacred relics that Brother Maynard           carries with him!  Brother Maynard!  Bring out the Holy Hand Grenade!  Monks: (Chant)                      Die Jesu domine,                      Dona eis requiem.                      Die Jesu domine,                      Dona eis requiem.     (Pause.  Arthur examines the hand grenade, turning it over in his hands.)  Arthur: How does it....How does it work?  High Priest: I know not, my leige.  Arthur: Consult the book of Armaments!  High Priest: Armaments Chapter One, verses nine through twenty-seven:  Brother Maynard: And Saint Attila raised the Holy Hand Grenade up on high                   saying, "Oh Lord, Bless us this Holy Hand Grenade, and with it                   smash our enemies to tiny bits."                   And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the                   lambs, and stoats, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and                   lima bean-  High Priest:  Skip a bit, brother.  Brother Maynard: And then the Lord spake, saying:                   "First, shalt thou take out the holy pin.                   Then shalt thou count to three.                   No more, no less.                   *Three* shall be the number of the counting, and the number                   of the counting shall be three.                   *Four* shalt thou not count, and neither count thou two,                   excepting that thou then goest on to three.                   Five is RIGHT OUT.  Once the number three, being the third                   number be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade                   to-wards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff                   it.  Amen.  All: Amen.  Arthur: Right!  (pulls pin)          One!          Two!          Five!  Bedevere: Three, Sire!!  Arthur: Three!  (throws hand grenade at the Killer Rabbit)     (holy music)     KABOOM.

      Greetings, friends and visitors! As of today there are only seven days left of GSP! Today I did what for me was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do. I said "no" to watching a movie that flew in the face of everything I believe. I didn't think it was going to be a hard thing to do. I was wrong. It was very hard. I had to explain to my teacher that I couldn't watch the movie. That really doesn't sound like a hard thing to do, but to bring myself to walk up to her and say, "I just wanted to let you know that I will not be watching the movie this morning" took more courage than I've ever&nbsp;needed to use before. Do you "use" courage? I don't know. But I couldn't think of a better word. She asked me why not, and I eplained to her that my moral standards do not allow me to watch a movie that contains any nudity or sex. And this movie did. By the way, the movie is called "The Cider House Rules". You can find a review on it  urlLink here , but why even&nbsp;bother? It's a pro-abortion, pro-incest, pro-fornication movie. I was highly disappointed to learn that Tobey Maguire has a lead role in it. Hollywood is a wreck.&nbsp;That's all for now.   RcYoAxN

      OK everyone, sorry I've only been posting lyrics recently, but I really don't have too much time. It's not like anyone reads this blog anyway. But anyway, if you look back at one of my first posts, you'll notice that I mention a song by Superchic[k]. This song really is my song while I'm here at GSP. Here it is in its entirety.   Artist: Superchic[k] Album: Last One Picked  Song: So Bright (Stand Up)   you're bored, gotta wonder if there's more  waiting for the dreamlife you thought you had in store  trying to feel something you can chase a life thats thriller  living on the edge drinking, smoking dream killers  coulda been shoulda been woulda been,  what might your life have been  today you're not a has been  but at your life's end  will you have regrets then, have regrets then?  are you ok with today if tomorrow is the end  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could rewind and play it again   [chorus]  stand up write the soundtrack for your life  it doesn't happen to you you happen to life  stand up, you know you're gonna have to fight  don't wanna lose the will to find your light  stand up, God gave you the gift of life  it doesn't happen to you, you happen to life  stand up, do something with your light  you're a light on a hill, you're meant to shine so bright  so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright so bright   we're all scared, gotta wonder what's out there  shooting down the ones who did what we wish we dared  everybody's scared to karaoke in the open  afraid we're not as special as what we might be hoping  so we're frozen, haven't chosen  just going through the motions  faith and belief, courage overrule emotions  stand up and be counted for something when it's time  decide where you stand, take your hands raise em high  live today through the future's lens  don't wanna wish you could reset and play it again  [chorus]

      I heard this song on the Air1 last night for the first time in almost three years. I had totally forgotten it. I love this song! You gotta hear it to really appreciate it though.  Artist: Lloyd  Album: Thoughts From A Driveway  Song: Listening For Whispers   Another day is gone And I can't find a shooting star Is this a message Or an acid test of faith?  I've prayed a thousand times But I can't hear a sole reply This "waiting patiently" Is more than I can take  She was afraid of mine Awaiting some angelic vision She lost a lifetime Searching for a sign  [chorus] Don't you know that We are listening for whispers When we cannot hear the screams  The sun is blinding us And still we look for matches We cannot just deny this anymore  He was a fortune teller Always working late night He spent his days in search of something That was real  She was a beggar in the park Where he was contemplating She said that he was blind 'Cause God is here  [chorus]

      My song for the day:  Superchic[k] - Karaoke Superstars - Not Done Yet   Superchick in the house tonight!   It's been one of those days for a lot of days now,  I need a day where the world can take care of itself.  This isn't what I wanted,  How I thought my life would turn out,  And I wonder if it's like this from here on out.   Sometimes life gets you, but we go on.  Sometimes life gets you, we're still going on.   We're not done yet,  not going quietly into the night,  Not me and my friends.  We're not done yet,  Don't take it too seriously,  It's just life  We'll win in the end.   And we walk on and on and on and on.  And we walk on and on and on.   It's been one of those days for too many days now,  I did a thing that I didn't want to do again.  I fell down in the place where I always fall down.  And I want to give up and let it be what it's been.   Sometimes life gets you, be we go on.  Sometimes life gets you, we're still going on.   We're not done yet,  Not going quietly into the night,  Not me and my friends.  We're not done yet,  Don't take it too seriously,  It's just life  We'll win in the end.   And we walk on and on and on and on.  And we walk on and on and on.   It's been one of those days, but I don't care now,  It was only a day, and tomorrow's ahead.  I got this far, and I know that I can ride this one out,  Though I want to lay down, but I won't quit yet.   Sometimes life gets you, but we go on.  Sometimes life gets you, we're still going on.   We're not done yet,  Not going quietly into the night,  Not me and my friends.  We're not done yet,  Don't take it too seriously,  It's just life  We'll win in the end.   And we walk on and on and on.  And we walk on and on and on.   3x:We're not done yet,  Not going quietly into the night,  Not me and my friends.  We're not done yet,  Don't take it too seriously,  It's just life  We'll win in the end.   And we walk on and on and on and on.  And we walk on and on and on.

      It's been amazing to me here at GSP that total strangers can meet and pair up into their little boyfriend/girlfriend relationships after less than a week. I don't see how they can even remotely get to know one another in that short of a time. I still don't know my friends from my homeschool group very well. And of course at GSP there is quite an emphasis on dating. I don't date. "You don't date?!?!?!? WHY????" Because I know that if I date people, I will get emotionally atached to them, and breaking up will hurt one of us very deeply. Which I definitely don't want. "But how will you find her?" As Peter Liu from  urlLink  7X Teen Ministries  put it so wonderfully:  "I believe God is going to plant her in my path. And by normal, godly interaction, I'll get to know her character. I don't have to date her to know her favorite color, or know what kinds of movies she likes. I'll already have a deep spiritual connection to her. Then I'll see if she's the one I spend the rest of my life with."  Sometimes I wish God would just say to me, "Ryan, look over there. There she is." But that just isn't going to happen. But I do believe that God has a plan for my life, and He will make everything clear to me eventually. BarlowGirl said it perfectly (from a girl's perspective), so just change the lyrics a little.  So what? I'm not your average girl I don't meet the standards of this world Chasing after boys is not my thing See I'm waiting for a wedding ring  No more dating I'm just waiting Like sleeping beauty  My prince will come for me No more dating I'm just waiting 'Cause God is writing my love story  I feel the same way. Of course, it's hard not to date when everyone else around you is dating. But I know that my wife, when I finally meet her (or maybe I already have) is worth waiting for. As Peter continues later on:  "I'm going to wait for my wife. And I know that she's worth waiting for. I know that whenever she smiles, it's because she loves Christ and me, not because I played with her heart. And I won't have to dig through secrets and excruciating experiences to see who she really is. I know at this instant, her heart's already too beautiful for me. I don't want to hurt her. I want her to have all that I can give her. I want her to have a Godly man protecting her. I want her in the arms of a real Man. I want her to wake up and smile at the sight of her husband. I want her to pick me."  And that is exactly how I feel. So to my wife, whoever and wherever you are, I love you, I'll wait for you, And may God continue to reveal himself to you in a truly awesome way. If you ever feel like nobody loves you, I do, and always will. I know you probably won't ever read this, but that's OK. I love you, I love you, I love you.  Ryan

      The long awaited rains Have fallen hard upon the thirsty ground And carved their way to where The wild and rushing river can be found And like the rains I have been carried here to where the river flows, yeah My heart is racing and my knees are weak As I walk to the edge I know there is no turning back Once my feet have left the ledge And in the rush I hear a voice That's telling me it's time to take the leap of faith  So here I go I'm diving in, I'm going deep  In over my head, I want to be Caught in the rush, lost in the flow,  In over my head, I want to go The river's deep, the river's wide,  The river's water is alive So sink or swim, I'm diving in     There is a supernatural power In this mighty river's flow It can bring the dead to life And it can fill an empty soul And give a heart the only thing Worth living and worth dying for, yeah But we will never know the awesome power Of the grace of God Until we let ourselves get swept away Into this holy flood So if you'll take my hand We'll close our eyes and count to three And take the leap of faith Come on let's go   Steven Curtis Chapman - Speechless - Dive

      Hello Everyone. Today is Saturday. I was downstairs in the lobby of my dorm, when I noticed several people standing in the hall with Bibles in their hands. I asked them what they were doing, and they said they were going to the Seventh Day Adventist Church. I was intrigued. I had heard of Adventists before, but I didn't know what they believed. So I got online and did some research. Basically, all their beliefs seemed to line up with mine, except (possibly, but I'll have to do some more research) for the fact that they believe that that a woman, Ellen G. White, was given over 2,000 prophesies by God in her lifetime.   "Seventh-day Adventists believe that Mrs. White was more than a gifted writer; they believe she was appointed by God as a special messenger to draw the world's attention to the Holy Scriptures and help prepare people for Christ's second advent. From the time she was 17 years old until she died 70 years later, God gave her approximately 2,000 visions and dreams. The visions varied in length from less than a minute to nearly four hours. The knowledge and counsel received through these revelations she wrote out to be shared with others."  &nbsp; &nbsp; http://www.whiteestate.com  Now, if all the prophesies have come true, and they are consistent with what the Bible teaches, then I have no problem with Adventism. But, if even one prophesy is wrong, then I believe that Adventism has a serious flaw, and therefore I cannot agree with it. But as of now, I have no information on what the prophesies were. Interestingly enough, I went to  urlLink Selectsmart.com's Christian Denomination Selector , which is a "place where you can figure out where your Christian beliefs match up with. This is the simple, clear, and accurate way to examine your beliefs and figure out which Christian denomination would be most appropriate for you." Here, you answer about 20 questions concerning your fundamental beliefs, clikck "show your results", and you are presented with a list of denominations your beliefs line up with, ranked by best match. Here are my top 3 my results:   My #1 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  Christian Denomination Selector  , is  Assemblies of God   My #2 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  Christian Denomination Selector  , is  Church of Christ   My #3 result for the SelectSmart.com selector,  urlLink  Christian Denomination Selector  , is  Eastern Orthodox Church   Eastern Orthodox? Hmmm. Maybe I'll have to check them out. But I really like the church I've been going to, which just happens to be my number 1 result! Wow! I don't have anything else to say. Later, people.

      I really don't know how I'm going to make it through college. I just can't stand lectures. I just sat through a two hour class on telescopes. Sounds cool, right? Well, I was ready to leave in thirty minutes. I just can't sit still for two hours at a time. OK, there are some exceptions. Scott Somerville from the Home School Legal Defense Association gives some fascinating lectures. And I love LoTR. I could probably sit through all three movies in a row. As a matter of fact, I'm going to have to get some friends together and try that sometime. So email me if you're interested, and I'll try to work something out. Other than that, there is really nothing else I have to say right now. OH! WAIT!!! Bible study group update! It was awesome last night! We had over 50 people there! I think there had to be somewhere around 70 to 90 people there, but I don't have the attendance records to look at yet. But it was great to see so many fellow believers there. I mean, I had to leave all my Christian friends for 6 weeks. Most of them are in my homeschool group, and they are so cool. Think of them as your best friends. Times 50. They're always there for me if I need anything. Prayer, fellowship, support, etc. They're totally awesome. You hear that, guys? You all ROCK!!! But most of them are in California right now. So I can't talk to them for another 2 weeks at least. I was so blessed to walk in the doors of the room where we had the Bible study and see 10 people sitting there. "Awesome!", I thought. "There are more people here than I thought there would be.". Imagine my surprise as more and more people kept coming in, until the room was full of fellow Christians. It was incredible! Our God truly is an awesome God! I love all of you guys. That includes the girls too. For me, "guys" is usually a gender-neutral term. More to come later.

      Hello everyone! I'm bored because nobody I know is on IM. most of them are on their way to California for Bible Quiz Nationals. Maybe you'll run into them, Cautioneer. Most likely you won't. But you never know. So, I'm bored at the moment. But tonight I have Bible study to look forward to. But in between now and study, there will be a "values clarification" class. The liberalism of the people here knows no bounds. I was told last time, "We will discuss things here that you won't get a chance to anywhere else. You may feel uncomfortable at times." Fun fun fun. I'm really looking forward to that. I just have to remember I'm earning at least a $20K scholarship by being here. Which comes down to 50 bucks an hour if you exclude the time I sleep. So I'm making money right now. Not too bad. Hey, everyone! I'm getting paid to blog! Later, people.
