       urlLink Main Page - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia : "Featured article A heavy metal umlaut is an umlaut over some of the letters in the names of a heavy metal band � although the names will then sound very silly to people who use languages in which umlauts are common, such as speakers of German, Turkish, and Swedish. The use of umlauts is often in concert with using Blackletter type (or more often Pseudo-Blackletter) in the band logo, to give it a more gothic feel. Many bands have taken to using diacritics, often gratuitously, in their names. The original use appears to have been by the Blue �yster Cult in 1971. Mot�rhead and M�tley Cr�e then followed. Spoof band Spinal Tap parodied the idea still further in 1982 by putting the umlaut over the letter 'n', which does not occur in any known language or belong to any standard character set. Recently featured: Greek mythology � Billboard � History of computing hardware"

Game moments   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  What moments in games do you think would make really good film sequences? The only rule is that you cannot choose a moment already in a film, eg. The D-Day part during Medal Of Honour as that was in Saving Private Ryan. My moments are:  1.) Spiderman (PS1) - the Subway sequence where Spidey takes on about 25 lizardmen. It was hard, but good. 2.) Devil May Cry (PS2) - Dante Vs. the Black Knight was a great fight. In fact, the whole game would make a good film. __________________  Big thanks to PieMasterMike for the sig!

We've got big, big love for these links of woo. Get to it click-monkeys. found by rob  B3ta Newsletter Summer Holiday best of, out now - featuring some of the best stuff b3ta people have made this year. BTW: We better mention this touching Reagan Tribute as there would be little point in saving the link for next weeks newsletter. We hope to be running one for Maggie Thatcher shortly... found by rob  B3ta Radio Wank Stories, torrent up - we're starting to stick up the radio shows as bit torrents / MP3s. Last week we were enjoying your stories about wanking and had CCC in for a chat. Full instructions on how to download available via the linky. found by rob  B3ta Newsltter Issue 138, out now - got some good stuff this week.

Tears of linky spunk champagne. found by rob  Rob Manuel's stuff back up - one of our servers went down for 4 or 5 days meaning that people couldn't find (what I like to think of as) my finest contributions to the betterment of man such as Female or Shemale, Name That Beard and Hey Hey 16k. They're all back now. And boo-sucks to the porn sites that were immediately on our case wanting to host Bukakke. You mucky pups. found by rob  B3ta Newsletter 137, out now - Huzzah. This week is fantastically strong week for B3ta contributions. We've got kitten on a motorbike from Rob& Joel, New stuff from Weebl, a great squirrel band, a sky diving game, a game from Monkeon. Fuck me - it's packed. And it rocks. Forget everything - this is what you should be looking at. found by rob  B3ta Newsletter Issue 136, out now - this week we've got celebrity swearing, a bloke filling a water pistol with petrol and a monkey masturbating with a toothbrush.

We've got a packed newsletter this week. There's absolutely genius stuff from Koit, a great video of a bottle bomb, dragon cocks & fake blob for tranny-men. Read it. It'll do you good. found by rob  Download B3ta Radio - Rathergood Special - each week we do a cheeky hours radio in London. Many of you can't hear it - which makes us sad. Anyway as an experiment we've stuck up an MP3 of the show as a bit torrent. Hopefully that means you'll be able to download it and listen. We've picked a recent show that we enjoyed a lot - the day we invited Joel & Alex from Rathergood in to sing their classic songs such as Giant Bee and We Like The Moon. found by rob  Watch B3ta TV - instead of making a texty newsletter this week, we've made it as a TV show.

Thank you!       .:Links   Conno-Vids Bohica Gaming Community Who Dares Wins Maddox Louise's Site      .:Contributers   A list of contributers can be found by going to the forums, going to ''member list'' then changing ''Showing:'' to ''contributers'' - these are all people who have contributed to the site, mostly by submitting quotes. The only exceptions are Conno and Shakey, because i can''t put them in the contributers AND conno-vids group. And i can''t give a link to the contributers group, because the forums are gay like that.

Firstly, Rehan's Chemistry Apology is up, so go read it now. I think his original rant was totally right, but anyways... Find it in the Rants section fo Stuff.   Secondly, the forums have been made private. That means that in order to see them, you have to be a member, and in order to be a member, you have to register and then i confirm it, so that, basically, people i dont want on there aren't on there. Don't worry, if you go to our school or whatever, i'll let you join, it's jsut to keep others out.   Finally, Shaky's gallery has been moved to the forums for the same reasons.
