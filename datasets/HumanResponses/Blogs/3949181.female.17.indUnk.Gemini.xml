       Greg and I are back together. We made some rules to try to get this relationship to work. So far it's working. I just told him though that I want a week to myself. He hurt my feelings and I want to be alone. He bought me a N64 and a few games. Since we're not allowed at each other's houses I asked him to get a box and send it to me. Well now he asks me if he can buy some games for it and play them at his house. I told him he can just keep the N64 and games then. I don't understand. He has tons of computer games and an xbox and his friend, Randy, has like&nbsp;playstation or something yet he want to keep the N64 that he supposedly bought ME. All I have is a stupid Sega Genesis. People have moved on from Sega but thats all I have and so I was so excited when he bought me an N64. Now I feel miserable. Oh well. He can shove it up his ass for all I care. He's so greedy when it comes to games. He's MAJORLY better than I am and when ever me and him play a game together he ALWAYS wins. I can't stand it. Anyways. Just had to vent for a bit.

        Greg and I are no longer together. He says he doesn't love me like he used to, which is understandable. I still love him, but its not as passionate as it once was because of all the torment we have caused each other. I can honestly say I'll miss having him but I guess it is for the best. If we were to get back together I don't know if he could love me like he used to. I know I could learn to love him again if he never forced himself on me again. Part of me still thinks we are meant to be, but part of me doesn't know what to think of all this. I feel like my heart has blackened and been smashed into millions of pieces. I guess I do miss him. No, he's not the most attractive guy and he's not the best kisser, but I love him. Before we got back together this past time, all I did was dream about him. Nothing special or "wet", just us sitting in a beautiful love seat laughing and joking with our families. His parents were there (both alive and happy together) and so were mine. I think about him alot. I can't honestly say I think about him 24/7. No one really does think about their sweetheart THAT much, but he was the only guy I did think of. Its too late now though. It's over and we'll never be together again. I guess it's time to tuck away all my plans for this fantasy wedding I had in mind and all the memories we share. I think I'm just going to wait until I'm out of college to even look for someone else.

       Today I have told Greg that I am empty of emotions. I have given him total freedom. He can do whatever he wants. He can go off with other girls. He can go places without telling me. He's 100% free. Alot of what I gave him freedom to do though, in my heart I don't want him to do. I can't stop him though. The way I see it is if he loves me, he'll do whats right. I don't talk to many guys. Only ones I do are brotherly figures (Ya know the type you wouldn't even dream of having any other relationship with.)&nbsp; Greg likes to go duel (play Yu-Gi-Oh) with his friend and his gf is always with him. I think Greg, subconsiously, likes his gf. I hate that but there is nothing I can do. She likes watching her bf and Greg duel and that makes me feel bad because Greg has always wanted that out of me. I just don't understand all that dueling stuff. I get so jealous when Greg is around another girl. I really don't want him doing anything with another girl but its his life. I can't stop him. All I can do is hope he does the right thing. Oh well if he doesn't. I've already given him total freedom.
