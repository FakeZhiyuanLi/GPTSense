       I will be leaving on Wednesday (the thirtieth) for a series of vacations that may lead me to absence until July eighteenth. Here is how it pans out:   On Wednesday I will leave with my dad and best friend,  urlLink Cullen , to Alpine Lake, California. My mom and sister will already be there. We will camp until Saturday the third.   Then, on the fourth, I will leave for my lacrosse camp in Santa Barbara. That is four days, from the fifth to the eighth. I will return home either on the eighth or the ninth.   Then, on the tenth, I will leave with that same friend and his family for a strange mystical place called Mather, where supposedly fun will abound.   I will return the seventeenth or eighteenth. Don't miss me too much. When I return I will begin on that quest to make a good design for this. Maybe I can get somebody to design me a logo and/or template at deviant urlLink ART

       Well, $ urlLink jark  has his  yellow [ alien ] probed  blog, so here's mine. Here are my plans:   Hopefully I can buy  urlLink bacon.com  soon, and this can be all mine. I will have an art feature, for all of my deviant urlLink ART , as well as an album for my "scraps" and such pictures that are not art per se. And of course I will have a blog. I hope I can somehow persuade my parents to let my buy a website (yikes), or at least keep it on reserve until I am old enough to buy it myself. Before then, I will attempt making templates again, if I remember any HTML, or maybe just commission somebody to make it for me.   I started to get uncomfortable with my  urlLink old blog , since all of my friends knew about it. It was hard to post on it and feel secure. I slowly stopped using it, because it took too much energy. Perhaps that will happen with this site too. But, I'd like to seem more professional than I really am.   I enter the world of blogger.

       Character 1  [ Question :  What is his name? ] is the true definition of a party animal. He is still 22 but out of college, living out of an apartment in Santa Barbara, where he had graduated from UCSB. He still keeps up with the college party life, and he chills every day with his college friends and frat brothers. This is the life he dreamed about: college with all the party, none of the classes, and all of the women.   He works at In-N-Out by day, but by night (and by lunchbreak) he hits the beach and hits the clubs. Every spare second he devotes to swimming and playing volleyball, Frisbee, football, and such sports at the beach; partying at all the clubs; drinking and shooting pool at all the bars, or at his friends house (the only friend of his that had a true "house") to practice with his band, Eargasm. He is single, but at the same time, he has no shortage of college girls to keep him happy. Things couldn't be better.   His one prized possession is all he needs to get through life: A sleek, powered up Mazda RX6. He has created a very close relationship with the guys at Santa Barbara Customs. For him, they created a monster. For them, they created a piece of art. Now Character 1  knows all the spots to push the limit (twice the limit, that is) on the straightaways unhaunted by the police.   Enter stage right Character 2  [ Question :  What is his name? ]. He is a complete enigma. Nobody knows his story, but they all know of him. To those that have seen him, it was an experience. To those that haven't, they are evenly split between it being a miracle or being a hoax. Some of the rumors that fly around say that he is a Martial Arts master gone mad, some say that his parents died as he was just a toddler. Whatever the story, his soul no longer exists, nothing but a steel determination to do all evildoers in. Wherever crime, corruption, or villainy strikes, you can count the seconds on one hand before Character 2  is on the scene. [ Question :  What is his superpower/claim to fame/signature? ]   One night, the current super villain [ Question :  Who was the supervillain and what is his story? ] revealed to Character 2  [in a dramatic fight scene, of course] that there was a Xenon reaction bomb hidden somewhere in the city, and at sundown one block of the city would be in ruins. Character 2  alerted the city, and, of course, some panic ensued, but nobody made drastic moves as the section was not yet pinpointed. As the sun was nearing the barrier of the sea, it was located in the floor of an apartment building, cemented to the foundation. No action was made, since the wrong action could set it off rather than preventing an explosion.   Immediately everybody on the surrounding blocks was evacuated. One door down, the last person filed out of building, a nightclub called  Eclips  and the whole group was herded to a safety barrier three blocks away. Police were dispatched to all the buildings in the danger zone to make sure every last person was out safely. Character 2  was sent in to the nightclub. Just as he finished his search and stepped out of the door, the police announced that it was the third and last call to evacuate. Five minutes to sundown. The soundproof doors and lack of windows had kept Character 2  oblivious of the announcements. Under the loudspeaker, he heard footsteps behind him. He turned to find what looked like a college kid step out of the bathroom and look around. "Hello?" He called. He spotted Character 2 . "Where is everybody?"   "Shit". Character 2  said, "You need to run. Now." And he disappeared out the door. Character 1  replied, "Shit." And he ran. As he got into the street, he saw nobody. Character 2  yelled back, "This way!"   As Character 2  neared the barrier, the policeman with the loudspeaker commented, "Shit." His loudspeaker was on. "You have 30 seconds!" He yelled, but Character 1  was still two blocks away.   Character 2  was almost to the barrier, but then he looked back and saw Character 1  still far from the barrier, and flagging. "Shit. He's not going to make it." And with that, he turned back at more than a full sprint, utilizing every day of his training and conditioning.   "Save yourself!" The loudspeaker man yelled to Character 2 .   "Run!" Character 2  yelled to Character 1 .   "Five seconds!" The loudspeaker man yelled to Character 2    "Aah!" Character 1  yelled to nobody.   "One second!" The loudspeaker man yelled to Character 2 .   Character 2  dove. Character 1  ran. The loudspeaker man winced. The bomb went off.   The green sphere expanded outward and upward. It seemed to travel in slow motion. The buildings wiggled, the windows shattered, the street rippled down its length.   Character 2  collided with Character 1 's stomach, and took him down, knocking the wind out of both of them. They had hardly hit the ground before the wave passed over then and dissipated not 100 feet behind them.   The loudspeaker man dropped his loudspeaker. The crowd screamed, babies cried.   For a moment, there was silence.   Then, every last building collapsed as if it was in a garage-floor bound elevator. A cloud of dust unlike the green explosion flew outward, this time not stopping as it covered the crowd and eventually the entire town.   All that was found was the body of Character 1 . The next day a funeral was held for the anonymous hero of the city.   But two days later, when Character 1  woke up the in the hospital, he started to hear voices in his head.     To Be Continued...

       Further development of my superhero character. This is a bit of a comparison between his normal life and his hero life.   During the day, he is loud, funny, and social. Rather than doing any real work, he parties, hangs out with friends, and hits the clubs. A real party animal.    Strengths : Always having fun and in a good mood. Good musician and dancer. Quick reactions so he can crack witty jokes with perfect timing as well as drive at incredible speeds and not get caught or injured.    Weaknesses : Fast cars, excitment and adrenaline, women, In-N-Out, Subway, Taco Bell    Hobbies : Dancing, playing in his band, shooting pool, swimming, eating   At night, he becomes a masked warrior, who is all about discipline. He hardly speaks, but when he does, he makes sure it is wise and profound. When not off fighting crime, he will stay up all night building up his strength, practicing his fighting skills, but mostly meditating. He needs to meditate just two hours a night to equal ten hours' rest. He shares his alter ego's love for speed, adrenaline and excitement. Thus his nighttime transportation is the same as his daytime: a sleek, incredibly fast convertible.   He distances himself from other people so as to not get attached. Because he is so emotionally closed, he is known to cost the lives of innocent people. But, that also means he can perform death-defying stunts without fear.    Strengths : Does not value his life.    Weaknesses : Lack of physical strength, need for independence. Does not value the life of himself or his friends.    Hobbies : Swimming, meditating, horseback riding, physcal training.   Alright..thinking as I type here, but how about these are two different people. One of them is a warrior, a refined yet ruthless hero against evil, and one is your every day party animal. Through some strange phenomenon (which is the birth of every comic book hero) the two people are combined into one being. In the beginning, they were fighting for control all of the time, but that proved so tiring and pointless that they agreed to share control in shifts. While the spirit in control had complete control over the body, the other could still communicate to the other.   (I'm on a roll, here) That way, when in public, the casual guy takes over, but in the privacy of their home, the hero takes over, building up strength. At night, the casual guy sleeps mentally, while the hero continues to train and meditate.   Thus, they have created an interesting relationship with eachother, and provide mostly differing opinioins with each other.   Awkward moments are created when the casual guy is in control in public when the hero notices a crime. The casual guy must make a quick excuse as the hero takes over and runs to help. His friends are always baffled by his seemingly bipolar mood shifts.   Wait. Try this out: The hero had established a reputation, and an villain had a type of chemical/nuclear/experimental bomb that would explode a busy nightclub, hopefully killing all the innocent people inside. Among those innocent people was the casual guy. The hero tried to prevent the explosion somehow, but he could not, so he got everybody to evacuate. And once he thought it ws all clear, the casual guy stumbled out of the bathroom. The hero dove just as the bomb began to explode, and landed on top of the guy to protect him. And so, they were fused together.   Now please. If you managed to read this far, leave me a comment at the bottom of this blog entry or in my dA journal telling me so. And while you are at it, advise me on what I should change, what you like about it, and what you think their names should be.

       My Mom just came home! And she brought with her this great set of camera stuffs from my grandfather.      Included :  Minolta XG7 SLR. Suspected broken.  MD Rokkor-X 1:14 50mm lens.  Zesnar 1:2.8 28mm lens.  Zesnar 1:2.8 135mm zoom lens.  Minolta Auto 132X flash unit.  Three 2-packs of GE flashcubes.  Eight assorted rolls of film.   Of course all of this stuff is really old. The lenses don't fit my Rebel, so I am not quite sure what to do with the lenses. I experimented a bit taking pictures through them with my Coolpix (I have waay too many cameras now) so I might post those on dA.   I'm kind of afraid to use the film, because it is old and might be spoiled, and because I don't have a darkroom and I don't want to pay to develop them.   Anyways I just wanted to share with you this find. I'm pretty excited. I have a bunch of film, a flash unit, and flashcubes that I can use on the Rebel. The other stuff...I might just put on the shelf next to my brownie. Hm.... I should go look for that old camera...maybe post some pics so y'all can see it.   [ urlLink b ]ac0n

       I, Robot.   I think the biggest reason why this movie turned out so well was that the screenplay was based on a book, not written for a movie.   Isn't it funny how the best movies are based on books?   Anyways. I, Robot looked like it would involve a large portion of robot-slaying action sequences, but it did not in fact. It was mostly a mystery "Howdowepreventthisimpendingdisasterandwhatexactlywillitbe", and then when fighting and action sequences did commence, they were spectacular. The filming was phenomenal, with intorduction of some shots that I had never really seen before. They were mostly gyrating shots that spun around an invisible sphere around Will Smith while he shot robots. They used it only about three or four times, so it was not overused, but it really created an incredible effect.   Another great part of the filming is when the house is being demolished. Here is a great use of that dramatic camera-shake effect that is used all to commonly in movies. The difference was, you cot the full impact while still seeing what was actually going on.   Another edge this had over action movies was that there were no parts where anybody did something humanly impossible, except for one or two where there was a very good excuse.   The plotline was one that seems like it had been done too much before but when I thought about it, the Matrix and Star Wars Episode II were the only similar ones I have seen.   I'm not one to really really understand a movie unless I see it about three times, so the whole end sequence didn't make a lot of sense to me...I can't think about big concepts as those. But I'm sure it was good.   In review, this was the  most kickass movie I have seen in a  long  time .   See it. Now. No seriously. Go. The next one starts in 25 minutes.

       Spiderman 2.   The movie was action packed and thrilling, but it had its faults. I can give it that it was better than the first.   First of all, I thought the music was a little off. Swelling orchestral music didn't fit the theme of the film. Or maybe it did, it was just slightly overused.   Second, the cheesiness was almost unbearable. My dad brought up a good point, however, which was that they probably were tyring to keep the comic book feel.   Also: If this is to be a trilogy, then how will there be a third? I hate to spoil it if you haven't seen it, but they all know he's Spiderman, Mary Jane (lmao) Is in love with them and they will live happily ever after, and everything's hunky dory.   What the movie did have going for it was the whole time MJ and Peter's relationship just tore at your heart, how he had to just turn her away and disappoint her at every turm to keep her safe, and how she could just walk away, then realise that she wanted to go back just as the door closed again. That was good.   The fight scenes were awesome too, Doc Ock was a great villain, very well portrayed.   I say, go see the movie. You might like it, you might hate it, but either way you have to see it.   [ urlLink b ]ac0n

        Mood : Superstrength!   Song :  Led Zeppelin :  Babe I'm Gonna Leave You ,  Black Eyed Peas :  Let's Get It Started    Band : JET   Movie : Spiderman 2   Book :  Kavalier and Clay  by Micheal Chabon   Well, things are starting to come together. The last day at Mather, I found my journal, which I had intended to write down any good jokes in. I wrote in a few that I could remember, and then read what else was in there. Among it was a very good outline of my character-in-development. Formerly known as Shiro, and even formerly known as just Tom, the pseudo-samurai was born as I was reading  Shogun  by James Clavell, and so I was obsessed with Japanese culture.   After getting to know a wide range of people on deviant urlLink ART , and cooling off my obsession by finishing the book, I realised that samurai were far too common an obsession. So, I took all the key elements of the character, but dumped the katana, kimono, and name (but kept the Zen Buddhism). Now, I think I have another application for good ol' Shiro.   As you can see above, I have just finished watching Spiderman 2. Review next blog entry. I am also reading  Kavalier and Clay  by Micheal Chabon, which is about two kids who dream up a comic book hero called the Escapist and reap cashmoney.   I also developed a little joke with  urlLink Kris  about a superhero duo, making us Captain Abnormal and her faithful sidekick, Bacon Boy.   (See where I'm going with this?)   So. The perfect avenue for my character/mascot would be from samurai to superhero. The question is, what kind? I hope I can figure this out myself, but I need your help because frankly I'm too lazy to think that hard. Here is the character outline:    He cares little for life, which makes him virtually emotionally invulnerable. This is his main advantage, for he can beat even those with superior fighting skills (of which there are few) by finding and prying into their weaknesses. He is completely cut off emotionally except when he engages in art in all its forms. He fights against evil of the physical world and the evil of the spirit, such as corruption, blind power, and the like.   He prefers to be alone, because extended contact with others slowly drags down his defenses, and might allow him to attach himself to someone. This cannot happen at any cost, attachment to any person or anything. He speaks very little, and when he does, it is profound and wise.   His knowledge covers just what subjects concern the world he is in, and in those he is second to none. He knows history, every culture, every civilization, every economy from the dawn of time until the present. He can use over 50 different methods of hand-to-hand combat, and knows hundreds of others.   His style of fighting is based on speed. He has no more strength than an average man, but has intensely quick hands, feet, senses, and reactions. He has tremendous patience.   From his detachment from other people and his fight for good, he has created a parallel with nature which leads to deep understanding between him and the large force that some might label as Mother Nature that has a presence in all life.   During his free time, he will meditate nearly all the time, or engage in meditative activities. These include exploring the wilderness on his faithful horse, swimming laps around the lake near his home, talking walks or long runs, or staying home to read up, practive his fighting, or writes, draws, or writes music. He loves speed, so he will take his various vehicles out on the rarely-driven roads by his house and push the needle.   Unfortunately, I have few flaws for him. He will cost the life of innocent bystanders in order to defeat an enemy, or might have to face temptation to women or friends. In his fightig technique, he could get stuck in a test of strength against the opponent and be beaten.   So. All I have to do is invent a history, refine his character, give him a claim to fame and a name (Cajun man voice: Rhymation!) and he'll be a good superhero. He should be known for either his nobility and rigidness or for his quickness and need for speed. Oh yeah, and I need a non-ninja non-samurai warrior for him to be. Please give me comments or notes and help out!   [ urlLink b ]ac0n

       On the 10th, my friend Cullen took me up with him to a camp just outside of Yosemite called  urlLink Mather . We stayed in a cabin down the road from the actual camp. With us were Cullen's  urlLink dad and his partner in business .   While we were there we engaged in all sorts of fun activities. I went on two trail rides, and got my horseback riding juices back, so I could relive the dream of having a horse and a big wide area to just run around in all day. The second ride was the coolest, because we stopped in the middle of nowhere where there was a campsite, and ate breakfast, then got back on our horses and kept going. It could be the best breakfast I've had in a while. And you  know  I ate a lot of bacon. The horse in front of me farted a lot though.    We also went down to the lake and swam around, and checked out bikinis, and suntanned, and tried to catch turtles. Cullen's dad (who came to Mather for 60 years straight!) told us the technique. When the turtles get close to the edge, close enough to dive to, you jump off the shore and try to smack the turtle. Then they'll pull into their shell and just float, and you can grab 'em. I tried this twice. I fell just an inch short the first time and he swam away. The second time he swam away just as I came down but I just brought my hands down hard and smacked him like 6 inches below the surface. Of course I also smacked my belly and face. And he got away anyway. It was a lot of fun though.   We also went to these Indian locations, where there are still small arowheads and flakes from their creation. We hunted a total of about two and a half hours over the trip, and we got six arrowheads.   We also went down to dirt roads and I learned how to drive. Well, it was really really intuitive so basically I learned how for about one minute then drove for about an hour.    Around the house, when we had nothing to do outside, we would usually sit around and talk and make as many yo momma jokes as possible. Or we would eat. Or sleep. While Cullen slept, since I can't really nap, I worked on my cardhouse skills. I invented a new kind called a labrynth. My largest was 7x7 squares.   Cullen brought his CO 2  pellet gun so we also shot that when we were bored.   Early in the morning we went fishing. Ken, Cullen, and I each caught a fish over the three times we went. Sometimes Ken's other friend Roggy would come with his kid. Roggy was kickass. He was a lawyer too, but also a drummer for a bunch of bands. I got a whoel bunch of photos of the river we fished at so I will post those on deviant urlLink ART .   At night we would go down to the lodge and get cokes from the bar and shoot pool. It was a great time.

       Right now I am bouncing around the room in just jeans to Black Dog by Led Zeppelin, while chewing Orbit gum. I'm back, bitches!   Let me cover my adventure at the  urlLink Powell Brothers Offense-Defense Lacrosse Camp . It was quite interesting playing on the same team as quite possibly the best lacrosse player of all time.   As part of the camp I was given a free  urlLink Harrow lacrosse shaft  that has become my personal weapon. Christened the Beating Stick.   I also recieved a shirt signed by the brothers as part of the camp. Picture coming soon. Unfortunately, no pictures from that trip.   There was a one day layover between that and my Mather trip.
