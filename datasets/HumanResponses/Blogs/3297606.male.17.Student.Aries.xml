      Jerry. Hes a cool guy. hes the friggin funniest most un-self concious person in the world. yes! Here are some guidlines to follow when talking, thinking, or hanging out with Jerry.  1. He has no other name than "Jerry." If you try and prnounce his last name you will probably get shot. 2. never expect a normal conversation. 3. never tug at his hair, there are crocodiles in his hat.  now that your ready to meet Jerry, you can. good. well, today is thursday, and tyler and mike are off paintballing with their team. i guess if thursdays arent exciting, they are interesting. I hung out with Jerry a biut after school. we made laughter and made people around us really uncomfortable, as usual. there was a fight and jerry and i decided that it was because someone stole the big guys basket of fruit. after that was settled we let everyone know, so it was OK.  we then proceeded to have a fight of our own, it looked fun, so why not?. we decided that it would be over a small piece of green plastic that Jerry took from me. so we made the exchange and started yelling at each other. everyone kinda looked, like "woah hoh another fight???" but then they realized that it was me and Jerry and knew what was going on. after that got old we lit Dr. Pawlick on fire. just kidding, we didnt even have any matches.  Lord of the Rings: Return of the King came out on DVD on tuesday, i still dont have it. i need it. thats what i SHOULD be doing right now. oh well... i will get it. Typing to the melodies of Unwritten Law is fun too.  I want to dye my hair black. i am going to do it. im not sure when, but im going to do it.  Bible study tonight... woohoo (i didnt actually say woohoo). They are good, but i dunno... the environment of it has gotten screwed up as of late, well its actually always been this way. I wish it would be more of a discussion than a lesson, more of a relaxed thing. I dont like it when there is a "teacher." i guess thats why i like Glens "martians" group so much, everybody has an equal say. I dont wanna create any fires, so im just gonna hang in there and see what happens. we started doing some recreational stuff recently, thats cool... hopefully its gettin better (not that it was ever bad). i have to watch what i say about some things on here because other people read them, but hey, this is my blog. i shouldnt have to worry, i dont want people coming up to me and saying "why dont you like thursdays?" because i DO like thursdays... i just am thinking out loud when i write these things. there are a whole lot of good things about thursdays.  thats a disadvantage about everyone knowing about your blog, you always have to try and not offend people, or you dont want some people reading some things. so blogs turn into just trying to please your audience. well SCREW YOU audience. ha! ok, i was just kidding about screwing the audience (that sounded sick) but yea, im going to be saying some things every once in a while that might offend someone or, as i said before, start some fires... but its nothing personal, i dont hate anyone... but just letting you know, from this point on i am going to try and not hold too many things back, im gonna be blunt. so dont read this if you cant deal with it.  wow this blog changed directions fast... started out as a fun blog about jerry, now its about international terrorism.  oh, and i dont feel like glorifying anyone anymore, it got old fast.... so get off your ego trip, jerk.  current: the southern current current looking forward to thing: airsoft

      well i was an hour late for work today. but it turned out fine. Tyler and I jammed to the beach after school and did some body boarding. the waves were small, but just big enough to have some fun. mike then joined us a little later and it was a blast. so we leave at 5:00 cuz i have work at 5:30. welp it took us an hour to get back to salinas.... huge traffic. got home at like 6:10, threw off my wetsuit (which is actually mike's) and did a "dip" in the tub to get some sand / saltwater smell off. got my uniform on, and my mom pumped out 3 overeasy eggs, some english muffins, and oragne juice... WOW that was the best meal i ever had.... its not WHAT i had, its just how much i needed a warm meal. so me and tyler engulfed our food and went to work. yes, we both went...  tyler and i worked together tonight. it was better than normal obviously. we got out late and my bro stopped in to help close, so it wasnt all that bad. yea no now im here.  these next couple weeks are going to be a lot of work, but once summer hits BAM good stuff will happen. yep.  airsoft monday, yea, im pretty pumped about that. good good.  tyler and i had a huge debate, which mike also joined to a certain extent, nothing was ever settled, nobodies opinions changed except mike turned against me. oh well. i love debating.... it is fun to me in a weird sort of way. debating makes me think, and i like thinking (at least about thyings worth thinking about). but its over now and we all hate each other. no, we dont, i was just kidding.  glens blog is hip, i like it. hes going to hume for the summer, we are all swimming in our tears. no, were actually not, that would be impossible and really gross to swim in your tears. we are all very happy for him. glen wins. yes. hip hip!  these times are good times, i hope they stay this way. and i hope i survive the last part of school. i also hope a cot of lions doesnt break loose and knaw off any of my limbs tomorrow.  so everyone is staying up all night. everyone being tyler and mike. i am thinking about it but i dont know, we'll see what happens. i do have some things i could do. nevertheless i am going to stay up very late. i wish it was tomorrow. i would have even more things to do. but yea, it should be interesting tomorrow to see our numbed reactions from sleep deprivation.  i may make another post tonight depending on how late im up, well see. peace.  glen smallman - glen is the assistant youth pastor. hes a rockin guy. he comes up with a plethera of good ideas. he has good taste in a lot of things like music and such. which makes him maximum cool. i like glen, hes great to the max. i hope he doesn't die soon, that would make me sad.  current ear-filling: friggin salt current sleep state: tired but still strong

      you know... i think life is good right now. there are a lot of things that suck, but i just realised that none of those things are bigger than i can handle. so yea, i think life is good.  summer is approaching. less than 2 weeks now. i have plans. big ones. this summer is going to rock every other summer times 10. i have a job, i have money, all my friends have their license (I SHOULD TOO but whateva, i got a job so thats good) so we wont be restrained to anywhere! bah man i cant wait.  airsoft this monday... memorial day.... 11:00. i cant wait  this memorial day marks the 1 year anniversery of the thomas and tyler show.... i think we should make another one sunday or somm. that would be fun fun.  uh oh. my computer is in the corner of a room with a window on each corner, so i have a full view of whats going on outside, and some little girl just got ran over by a bicycle. she seems to be ok. the girl who hit her is trying to get her to stop crying. stupid neighbors. pummeling each other with bicycles.  i wish i lived on a mountain, then i could do all sorts of handy things. oh well.  this blog sucks. stop reading. or ill stop writing. i think ill stop writing. i dont feel like glorifying other people anymore, so instead im going to make a recipe for you all to try.  recipe: "pik le plump bottle o lump"  - get a bowl - fill the bowl with a cup of milk - pour a bottle of asprin in - heat on 300 degrees for 10 minutes - pour bowl into half full bottle of favorite soda - shake well  bam! you have yourself a wonderful mermaid.  current movie: i hate movies, no i dont ha! current stick: brown

      ping pong. yea thats right. ping pong. its crazy awsome. i set up my table and the people now flock to my humble salinas home to spend hours of enjoyment on this sleek black slab of wood. it gets intense, there has been blood shed, and people have fallen to the ground.... yea, thats way hardcore.  anyway, this weekend i hung with the mike schmiess and the john hansen, and it was a weekend to remember. we went to a bon fire saturday night, it was justin mylander and sean iliffs birthday. it was F-U-N. Jerry was there, and when Jerry is ANYWHERE you know fun times are soon to come. man, i dont think ive laughed as much or as hard as i have this weekend in like one million years. i could sit here an write all the cool things that happened, but if you want details youll just have to talk to me in person. the bottom line was, this weekend was awsome.  there were like 9 ppl over today to continue the ping pong revolution, but we did more than ping pong, there was eating of pizza, there was watching of movies, there was filming of the camera, there was shooting of shotguns.... great stuff.  so im not going to school tomorrow, neither is tyler mike or jon.... welll mike MIGHT i dunno. but the reason for this is this: there was a threat of a shooting tomorrow! oh no! well thats really just our excuse for not going. there actually is a threat, but it doesnt really scare anyone, its just a great excuse to stay home. if there WAS a ashooting i would be kinda disappointed that i missed it. hopefully the gunfight conitunes down willow street liek a parade so i can watch from my front window. that would be good. they need to do that sometime. yea.  i think people should start doing arranged marriages again, then i wouldnt need to worry about this stupid EMO CRAP! dang it. yea i said im getting over it but what i really meant was its just loosening up.... i dont know if its possible to get over it. anyway im not going any further in depth because i would rather think about HAPPY THINGS like mike dancing in a dress of flowers!  have i done John Hansen yet? well if i have then im doing him again, hes just that cool...  John Hansen - COOL COOL COOL. he just started REALLY hanging out with us (us being mainly mike and i) and i never realized how awsome to the max he was. i always knew he was an intensly cool guy, but now i know, he is like a good template. His hair is crazy awsome, yea it is. John is like a parchment of gold... think about it for a while and then youll understand.   current good movie: paycheck current song you need to herar right now: seether - broken (featuring amy lee)

      i have no idea where this blog is headed, i just started writing and im not going to stop. hmm lets see, is there anything interesting thats recently happened? we went to the bagel corener in history today. that was fun. tyler almost killed himself working... but yoju can read about that on his blog. bum bum bum.  im kind of getting over all the "emo" stuff thats been going on, just kinda been accepting the facts, hopefully thats a good thing. yep... pahh.  you know whats kind of weird? the naked guy that hovers above my computer. i come here on my computer and night after night, day after day, even scince may 1st, this naked spectical has watched me. His golden body glistens and is the very centerof attention at my little "station." He holds his reeth with valiance and pride. Although he is naked, it seems he is missing some, er... certain organs. which i think is good, in my case, it must suck for him. this object of naked glory is infact my oscar. yep, good.  You know what would suck? if hats all of the sudden turned into head-eating ferrets. then the instant the hats transformed, everybody who was wearing a hat would die. man, that would SUCK. i bet they would be black instead of the generic brown, because black is way more deadly.  heck foo im eating. i have to cut the usual endings off before my parents poison my food.

      i invested in my future.... of airsoft. i spent $100 on some new hecka bomb gear. Im pretty excited about it. a lot of people are getting into airsoft so this is good, more people to play with. you need to get a gun, yes.... YOU. im not talking about these pansey spring pistols, im talking the real deal. the AEGs, tokyo mauri assualt rifles. if you already have one, get another one and give your old one to the "people who dont have one" foundation so we can get more people to play!  man with my new gear its gonna make the movie that were making about the terrorist / hostage thing a million times more awsome. jon and i are gonna look hardcore. so anyway, off the airsoft topic...  mike wrote some really depressing blog, seems everyone is becoming more emo by the day. on a more joyful note, i got my big white tent up in my yard! we put the ping pong table in there and were working on putting the foosball table back together. finally there will be something to do at my house when people come over. im even thinkning of setting up my N64 or PS2 out there. that would be rad.  welp summer is getting closer and closer, i cant friggin wait! its gonna be awsome, even though everyone will be working, the times that were not will be fun enough to make up for the hours of working boredom. and we'll all have money like grapefruit. agh man i cant wait. welp tyler and i want to go to the beach, but every day i have off, he doesnt, and every day he has off, i dont. we'll have to go next week sometime... bah, guess thats life.  welp time is ticking away, better start my end credits:  John Hansen - flowing hair like an angel. he is a fellow airsofter and his shotgun perspires with majesty. john is like an elf, graceful but deadly, because he is deadly??? john sits in baskin robbins for hours on end making beautiful music. if john were a food i would eat him.  current historical text - rule of reign 1949-1976 current currency - houston

      just got back from mikes in which we didnt play poker at all... but it was still fun. we just kinda hung out... didnt do anything too exciting. Tyler spewed a mike-made-mixture of pickle juice, milk, and some strange very strong and putrid smelling substance all over mike's kitchen, that was interesting.  Ben is back, yes... he is. The king city fair did a splode and he martyred outta there like 4 is after 3.  were all getting back into paintball / airsoft... meaning, some are getting back into paintball, while others into airsoft. There has always been a think line separating the two, and as time goes on, people are starting to stick to one or the other. hopefully people lighten up and play both again, but every time you mention airsoft to a paintballer they have to go off whining about how much better paintball is. I guess they dont realize its a matter of opinion, because it never seems to stop, no matter how much people tell them. (not naming any names TYLER). If i had to choose one, it would be airsoft, but hopefully i wont have to choose one or the other, hopefully the hostilities toward one another cool down.  anyway, so yea, i think im gonna get into airsoft a lot... and tyler mike and 3 other guys started a pball team, so i probably wont be playing paintball as much because every time tyler or mike will wanna play theyll just go with their team, understandably. but yea, me jon and a good group of other guys got airsoft, so im happy with that. i just hope every once in a while all the airsofters and paintballers merge to a big game of paintball, or a big game of airsoft (i can dream right?).  so yea, lifes OK i guess, school sucks to the max, along with a lot of other stuff, but hey im blessed so i cant complain too much... pshhh running outta things to talk about. oh... today i heard that Hitler is in fact not dead, but re-birthed as a stick of butter. he plans to become the first stick of butter to dictate a country while smoking pot at least 97% of the time. sweet.

      paintball or airsoft  I have decided, after Sunday, that I am in fact an airsofter. I love paintball, its awsome and adrenaline pumping, but paintball does not have the realism or strategy that airsoft does, and for me, even the adrenaline. Mike Schmiess said it well, "Paintball is more of a sport, while airsoft is more realistic." Some people say airsoft isnt as cool because paintball hurts a lot more. Yes, paintball does, but i dont like airsoft more just because it doesnt hurt as much...   Airsoft is my thing. i have never had even close to the amount of fun playing paintball as i had sunday with airsoft. I just thought i would let that out. I think i will still be getting a new paintball gun eventually, but my primary concern from here on out is definitly airsoft.  Anyway, i saw troy, it was awsome. It was "one of those movies" that you'll be talking about forever, and comparing other movies to. It falls into the "greats" along with Lord of the Rings, The Last Samurai, and Gladitor. Yea, its that good.  I was gonna go to the beach with tyler after school, but its lookin a tad overcast, hopefully it clears up soon. Which reminds me, thats something else i wanna get into, body boarding (aka boogie boarding). Tyler and I decided that were gonna take that up along with our million other hobbies. Man i am going to be doing some real money spending. I need a new canon GL2 camera, a body board, a wet suit, a new paintball gun, some extra airsoft gear... sheesh... getting this camera may take a tad longer than expected.   Will Bordinero - who? oh yeah, him. Will died sometime in 2nd quarter i think. There have been rumors of sightings every once in a while, but only half of his face is seen as anothers is always firmly planted in it also. Will was a good guy... he got swallowed by 'love.' or something like it. i barely remember him enough to write about him... but i know he was cool to the max. maybe one day he will return from the grave, and retake his place in the hall of kings.... i hope.  current arm - right (hurting) current hovercraft - Omar Alvero

      today at work was the longest shift ever. At least it felt like it. I worked from 1-6:30... but it felt like i had been there for at least one million years. There was something about today at work that made me feel uneasy. I dunno... i just wanted to leave, more than usual. oh well... its over now.  but hey! now that im off work i get to go see TROY! woo woo! mike said that i would love it, and i believe him. Any minute now an army of brads, evans, russels, mikes, and ashleys are going to rush up my doorstep and ignite the doorbell. cant wait.  Three Road has come very far, the site will be done within the week and its looking UBER! i cant wait. were gonna make this so much better than we were doing on flick films. if you see Ryan Marx, make out with him and tell him thank you (hes the guy who designed the site).  Christian Gross - HARDCORE! not the same hardcore as Jon, but hardcore as in musically. He is a hardcore kid to the max, and he is a great guitar player. I love christian with that "forbidden" love that only comes from rare fruit trees and empty logs. Christian is a sort of new addition to our elite clique, and were all so happy he could join us (sex).  current cuss word - ********* current brother watching me type this - Jonathan

      Ive determined that the bagel bakery is really good. and cheap. just thought i would throw that out there.  I started this post out serious, but then i realized it was a little too serious for tens of millions of people to be reading (refer to maximum emo title), so i am now CHANGING THE DIRECTION.  So im working tonight, and i guess a group of 40+ people are coming in tonight to get ice cream... great. Maybe ill fake a heart attack and skidatle outta there. Or accidently dress in an unremovable tuxedo so i cant scoop over 2 scoops an hour. that would be good.  well i just got done with a long debate with jon, which was settled in good graces, everybody is a winner. the point being i now have lost a lot of motivation to type much longer! so imma cut this blog a lil short.  Ben Vevoda - the master of humor. Ben is a dreamer. the coolest freshman in South Carolina, i mean California. a master of the cheffism.

      School ends. the day has just begun. As the bell rings i immediatley know what direction i am headed, there is no migling around after class, there is no friendly conversation, im out like a trout. Today is Thursday, and Thursdays are known for their awsomeness. They just have the reputation of being the best day of the week, and to this day it holds that reputation. The main reason is that the Salinas and Monterey people unite... but it has become even more than that. So back to the story...  I leave chemistry, i take a quick left, Jason Naylor is still in the class... now when i leave a class without Jason, you know something big is in store for what im headed to, because i always wait for Jason. so i walk quickly down the hall, Oliver Twist jumps out in front of me, and i pummel him into the thick floor tiles without even slowing me down. I head down the winding stairs, to "the meeting place," which is where everyone always meets between classes and after school, which is also mike and I's locker.  Now this is where the adventure starts, from this moment on is what made this day one of those days that are just better than all the others.  There he is, right where he is supposed to be... Tyler. I quickly put away my books, and with little hesitation we split outta there. OK.... i am going to have to start leaving some of the details out.... at this rate i wont finish the story until the war in iraq ends.  basically we rush to my house, grab the necessary gear, and head to 13th street beach. however, just when we enter 68, tyler realizes that his gas is below empty! fortunatly we made it to toro, in which we saw Gavin. There was laughing and jesting about as we filled the camery, but before you knew it we were outta there.  Ther rest of the trip was "deep thought mode," in which both tyler and I became really depressed, for the bulk of the trip to carmel. but once the CD was changed from Taking Back Sunday to Switchfoot things slowly got better. So we reach the beach. its freezing.  we are the first ones there, ashley mike and christian were supposed to be there too. But it would be a good 45 minutes or so before ashley came, and another hour before anyone else came. but while we were waiting, by chance, David Estrella showed up! so me david and tyler decided to hit the water. With dave on the skim board and me and tyler on our body boards. The water was about -29837 degrees. I thought i was gonna pass out and die. but once my entire body became numb, i couldnt really feel the freezing water.... so it was all good. IT was a blast, me and tyler tore up the waves... it was awsome.  So then come along Christian Monica and Mike. so we do a lil fanning action, summon fire from the skies, etc... and then get back to the fun. before we get in mike tyler christian and i took a little run down the beach, and then, with as little hesitation as possible, ran back toward the ice ocean of death. for me and tyler it wasnt too bad, for we had already experienced the extreme temperature drop (oh, none of us had wet suits by the way). so we messed around did some "gliding" and some baywatch action. and before we knew it we were back on the shore, bloody from the barrage of bullets that had come from the red devil apachie squad that attacked us moments earlier. but we were fine, so we moved on.  we then went to the hyatt to swim and hot tuBBB. it was pretty fun, and it was nice to be in reasonable temperature waters. we didnt get kicked out, which was disappointing, but hey it was still fun.  then we went to pizza my heart, then bible study, yea yea yea fun stuff. (as you can tell i am getting tired of details).  so in a nutshell.... today was a blast. a big blast, Hyroshima blast.  tyler is nagging me to hurry up and post this blog... i apologize for the lack of witty humor, but as tyler also said, this blog's priority isnt to make people laugh, although when i start writing things its almost inevitable... dont get mad when i dont do something funny.  that reminds me... i hate everyone.  Brad Duren - Hair. Lots of it. Brad is like those really expensive chocolates your mom gets for christmas. You have to eat them sparingly, but they are hecka bomb. Brad is a Montereyer, i am a salinaser, so this is why brad is like a rare delight... rare as in i dont see him every day, i still see him a lot lot though. if brad were a turtle, he would be a big black one that had the words "big bear" on the shell written in blood.  current movie thats coming out tomorrow - Troy current Tyler - Smith

      So the era of the blogs begins, mike started his blog last night. The blogs now have strength beyond what they did before, with the power of the triforce, they are indestructible. What army can stand up against Tyler Mike and Thomas? NONE!  i had to refer to zelda.com to remember the name of the triforce.  [img]http://www.celes-chere.net/zelda/nes/11.jpg[/img]  ^^^ does it work? ^^^  NO IT DOESNT! Ill leave it there for +10 sympathy points...  So we are going to the beach after school today, i cant wait. School is so boring now. I chronically bite my teachers, and the consequences are beginning to surmount! (note: surmount does not mean get bigger) (note2: YES IT DOES!).  so im in history today... but Mr. Williamson is teaching in another classroom (WHY? who knows!? maybe Tyler does!). So we have the wonderful Mrs. Grecko. right now she is on Mr. Williamson's computadora looking at american idol stuff. I hate that show!  no i dont...  American Idol is not my show, but i dont hate it. I have to admit it is a better idea than most of these other stupid reality shows that are coming out. They get worse by the day. Survivor has yet to be beaten. If i made a reality show, it would be called "Parch Ghill Arch III - X." In my reality show, instead of stupid fat people winning record contracts, or gay naked people winning a million dollars for having someone tape his inconvinience on a mound of sand... i would have a game where there are 10 people chosen at random, and brought to a boat in the middle of the ocean. They would all be expecting to be lead to some tropical island! but no! The captain of the boat and staff of teh show would kill themselves, or just jump into the ocean! this would leave the 10 people stranded on a boat with no food or drinkable water! (la captain would dispose of all food and drinkable water right before suicide). We could have cameras set up around the boat, and watch as they turn to cannibalism and become dehidrated drom drinking salt water! Whoever is living last would get a big round of applause, and the money to pay for the boat would be taken out of his account.   that would be a show worth watching...  Jon Vevoda - when you think of hardcore you think of Jon Vevoda. He could kill one million oversized quail in the snap of a finger crought. Has his own realm of awsomeness, and in this realm lies really big axes and explosives.  current equation: H2O + CO2 = EXPLODE current taste in mouth: bitter

      You ever have one of those experiences where you hate it while its happening, but are glad it happened once its over with? I had one of those today. it all started when i went to work an hour early...  So i go in at 5:30 and there is a customer yelling at Yuki, i kinda hurry to the back to punch in so i see whats going on, and when i walk back out, mrs. bray has joined in the festivity. Before you know it, Mrs. Bray sends a whirling punch into this 75 years olds jaw. The old man flys back and hits the floor. I run over to the fight, and mrs bray pulls out a revolver and turns the olf man into cottage cheese. I just kinda froze, and then all of the sudden Yuki turns into a Chinese Dragon! She immediatley scorches the Brandywine (code name for Mrs. Bray) and makes a banana split. I quickly yell out 3 flavors so she doesnt get too confused.  wait, thats not what happened... ok heres what really happend:  i get to baskin robbins an hour early, and yuki is training this new guy named brian... i give out the usual "heeeeey" and go punch in. when i walk back out, Brian is holding a cake, and then, totally spur of the moment, devours the entire thing in like 4.765 seconds! I kinda back up thinking "what the frik" and run into the Brandywine! i turn to apologize for the bump, and she is completely in the nude! i sheild my eyes and fall to the ground. By this time Brian had already exploded, i didn't actually see him explode, but i hear the loud pop and the words "Brian of EXPLODE" over the store speakers. i stumble back, not sure what to do, Yuki had busted out of there, leaving behind a trail of pink convinient spoon molds...  dang it, that didnt happen either.  ok all that really happened is that i went an hour early and it was really boring. and the mop broke again. i hate that stupid mop. But the Brian guy is real, he really is a new guy. thats 2 new guys we have, this is good news.  now there have been at least one million people that have asked me what "somewhere near nowhere" means... its actually quite simple:  somewhere near nowhere - New products and procedures that enter the marketplace are reviewed by the Hair Club team and tested for effectiveness.

      i decided that having a blog is like having your own column in the newspaper... its kinda cool. and i have also decided that columns should have a huge amount of pictures. i think there is a way to put pictures in, but i have not yet discovered how. I also need to figure out how to put links on the sidebar. html is like un-ripe fruit, beautiful in sentimation, yet course and crunchy in reformation and consumation. I think that analogy can be applied to many things in life.  i am again in my history class, doing absolutly nothing. Mr. Williamson thought it would be funny to come to school naked today as a joke, so i am trying my best to focus on the computer screen rather than his huge [EGO].  In all my long 366 years, i have learned that people like to read about themselves. So every update from here on out... i will say something about a person at the end of every post.   Mike Schmiess - smooth to the touch, yet a lion at heart. Mike can be compared to a festering kiwi: round, brown, with little green hairs on the wrinkled surface. on a scale of one million i give mike a "pais."  current role model: Houghton Mifflin current roll cake: mint chip

      so i drove today with a guy named Thomas. He was one of the weirdest people i have ever met... he was either gay and retarded or just so retarded that he seemed gay... and thats not an insult, that just the way he came across. i couldnt really describe him to you, you would have to meet him yourself... so go to Elichers on main st and ask for Thomas, and tell him to tell you a story. Then you will know what i mean.  His weirdness gave me comfort though, in some weird way. Once i knew that i had no need to have an ego whatsoever, i loosened up. If it was some hardcore surfer guy i would probably have been trying not to come across stupid or somthing stupid and self concious like that. Because hardcore surfer guys take the lives of people that come across stupid, especially ones that go driving with them. shtick.  My brother came to school at lunch today, that was pretty cool. we all just knida talked about our next movie were making and he finished the logo for "Three Road Productions." it looks good to the max. The only problem at lunch today was the whole red ball issue, and that also contunued until after school. Jon Hansen got pwned by mr. dihn, who is the most power trippin person youll ever meet. so me mike and jon decided that he needed to be dealt with... so...  tomorrow between 5th and 6th period, we are going to massacre him. we ask all those who wish to participate to meet on the upper level of the east wing, and bring a hatchet. he shouldnt put up too much of a fight, but he does know viet naked, so we still need to use caution.  free time comes far and few between now. i barley have time to write this, hence the reason the first post was in my history class... but today i actually had a good amount of free time. trillian just freaked out so i need to go fix it. peace...  current best band ever: AFI current chip weight: 43g

      So I'm in my history class right now. Mr. Williamson just threw a doorstop at somebody, however im not too surprised. We don't do anything in this class anymore because the AP test is over, and there is no point in doing anything else.  So I have made a decision, i have decided that I hate emotion in general. I wish that humans were more like robots, I mean, when was the last time you heard of a robot who was overwhelmed? it doesnt happen! they are robots! But no, humans have EMOTION, humans have to go around complaining about how life sucks, or go around skipping about how life is great, making the people whos lives suck grow a third arm. Emotion screws everything up, it makes everything complicated, emotion is the reason that we no longer have time.  a poster just fell on my teachers head...  Yet if we didnt have emotion, things would suck even more, except we wouldnt know it... if we didnt have emotion we would never be happy, and although we would also never be sad, it would suck to never be happy. So we lose either way.  YOU LOSE!  I guess I wrote this in light of Brad Duren, he started crying when i told him that he has a rare form of excess skin syndrom in his left neck-area.  current status: tired as helga current blog point: end

      So yeah, along the lines of Glen and Tyler, I, Thomas Ryan, have started a blog. I dedicate this website to Hands Down Henrel, a dear friend of mine who died processing meat in Belgium.  So yea, I just got back from Poker Night, which has transformed to more of just "do whatever night." fun stuff it is. Whenever me and Jon get together its like "movie mode," at least a million years is spent going over possible shots that we can get and stuff.  so on to the interesting stuff:  today at school ben got his head lobbed off, but it turned out fine, with a little rest he should be back up in no time. We still havent figured out who did it, but when we do, off with their pelvis. After school Jon and Mike came over and we found six naked trible leaders in my sisters closet, when we asked her what they were she lifted he hands, palms out, and spread apart, then put back together her fingers in a looping fast like motion. Shes been doing it ever since (523 years).  oh, mike went on a mission and completed 3 objectives in 17:33. but me and jon were down watching the last samurai, so when he reached HQ he couldnt find a way in and we couldnt hear him knowcking, so he climbed down a hole in my driveway and started banging on an underground window, and when i pulled away the curtains he yelled "bunt!" (the funny thing is this is completely true)  im still figuring out this blog thing so bare with me... (bare meaning naked)

      see that title? i didnt make it. it just randomly appeared there. purevolume square line royden. wow. i do happen to be on pure volume listening to a band named royden, which is very good by the way.  i just thought i would leave the title for kicks and for a small essence of undisclosed mystery.  i work too much  you know how there is a title on the top of internet windows? like if your at a site about meese, it might say "all about meese!" at the top.... well at the top of this blog window thing it says "BLOG THIS!" thats fun.  uh oh, an error thing came up on internet explorer. it says its going to close it. im writing this from internet explrer. this isnt good. i cant even see what i am writeing the error message is in the way. well, i guess this is the rusde interupption of the blog time.  ill edit this after i fix it and add more, .  ok, i am now editing the post. it turns out i clicked ok and it closed everything BUt the blog window. go figure, it was probably brad hacking into my RAM. he always does things like that.  as i justed over to edit this post, i realized a link on blogger that said "blogger something something solve your riddles!" that was exciting, whenever someone uses a word like "riddle" it makes my heart smelt. like the same kind of smelt that you do in runescape, where you have to make little bars out of your mining stuff. i always hated mining, it was so boring.  i think i failed chemitry, thats good. no it really isnt, i wanted to pass for some reason. oh well, it wasnt a required class anyway. ill just take PE for both semesters next year instead of just 1.  my secret mission in history failed, tyler poured soda on my keyboard and it kinda threw me off, so i spent the rest of the period hiding in the back while tyler galibanted about the room naked as a fish, yelling things like "who wants a peice of my blast shaft!?" it was really mal-lifting.  summer summer summmer, i think it basically is summer, tomorrow is our last day, but were not gonna do anything, just pally to and fro. i work friday night, saturday night (missing bonfire) and sunday. great. i am going to kill someone. its gotten out of hand, all i work is weekends while people lower on the scale than me are getting 10x better shift. uh uh.... nooo way. im gonna shaft the marzipan if there arent some changes real soon.  things i will resort to if i dont start getting better shifts: 1. panning for explosives 2. slurring the bray 3. puddle shovelling joe, even though he is cool, he is screweing my schedule 4. leaving dead bodies inthe back freezers 5. bleeding into the ice cream 6. telling customers we ran out of ice cream and all we have is frozen butter 7. holding my own free scoop nights 8. editing the schedule to say that everyone works on saturday night 9. lighting things on fire  maybe then they will re-think making a pottery out of me! ha!  (crackle) dash fist strikes again! (crackle)

      I just started using a program called "hello" to blog. it works along side with blogger.com, helps you post pictures, and do all sorts of other crazy things. actually just post pictures, but i feel way cooler while doing it  anyway, the "nearly impossible all nighter" is becoming a reality. Tyler, Brad and I are going for it. I think we can do it. im not tired at all and i have plaenty of things to do. Its only a matter of time before my brother gets home though, then i will have to be all quiet. bah.  brad started a blog. i suspect it to be pretty good, as he has quite the mind.  schools end approaches.  i will probably make another post within the night as i will be up pretty long. so ill update you on its success or failure.  Project 86's new CD came out and its good like a south american charm. jeez its so awsome. Its called "songs to burn your bridges by." you need to get it.  today at work we had a visit from some friends. tyler and i go t out past 11!!!! holy crap. Jerry, Danny, Justin, and Mystery X came in and were hangin out for a while. it was cool though, its all good. danny was swooning katie hugo apparently, saying he was larry. he was on jerrys phone with here for like 45 minutes. WEIRD.  Glen is still gone. yea hes gone like a bottom leaf ice formation. he went up to hume lake for the summer. I will see him within the month, so its not too devistating. i can nessle in his warm body again soon. very soon.  current song: project 86 - safe haven current time: 1:16 am  how could i go without trying this picture thing???? behond.... brad. &nbsp; urlLink     urlLink

      so some girl died over the weekend. car accident. of course her and the driver were drunk. i found out friday at work, but today at school its more evident of the seriousness of it. i just got back from the "hall of tears" i will call it. there is a huge line of paper with pictures and markers so people can write notes. It was pretty akward, just standing there while countless amounts of girls screamed and yelled as they sobbed. I knew her through middle school and freshman year. i used to talk to her all the time. I havent said a word to her in like 2 years though, so its not all that tragic to me (personally).  anyway, on a better note, airsoft was awsome yesturday. we have a pretty big group of people that play with us. its awsome. there are a few more things i want to get airsoft wise, but after that i am set. i love airsoft, just the feeling you get when your sneaking around, or in a huge ol battle.  sunday i hung out with christian. after church christian brad and i went to jack and the box, then back to "martians," glens small group thing. so that finishes, and we decide to go swimming. christian and i go to christians to pick up our swimming necessities, and we tell brad we will meet him at his house. about 15 minutes later we pull up at brads. nobody home. with a little frustration christian and i think maybe brad thought we were meeting at the hyatt (where we were going to go swimming). again, no brad. we call up a few people to see if brad just happened to change his mind without telling us. nobody has seen him. now its gettin a tad weird.  christian and i think a bit, and the realization comes into our heads that we were the last to leave the church. brad was the very last one there, everyone else, including all staff, etc were gone. we had stayed much later because of martians. so christian and i head back to the church. we find brads car. it is in the same parking spot as earlier. crap. we figure brads car broke down and he is walking home or somm. so we check all possible roads leading back to monterey.  for almost 3 hours christian and i looked for brad, calling coutless people, going to all the corners of central coast california. after we had checked everywhere about 5 times. we decided that there was nothing more we could do. so we went to cory overtons house where there was a overton / hugo / potter BBQ. that was fun, and about 6:15 we all headed over to glens going away party (yes glen is LEAVING).  so we arrive, and there is brad, sitting on the couch. AAAGH! apparently he had walked over to the Posts house which was not very far after his car had broken down. we had no idea they lived close. of course brad doesnt call. oh well. so glens going away party was fun. short and sweet.  so after that mike and i went to salinas to visit tyler working, and then stayed at my house. tyler came too after he worked.  anyway. agh. school is almost over! i want it to end, but i HAVE to get a VERY good grade on my chem final if i want to pass the class. so that should be not very fun. but nevertheless summer is almost here! yes!  warcraft 3 works on my temporary computer woowoo.  current predominant sex: male current rap star: omar alvero

      so ive been trying to change my profile picture forever, it seems it stuck on this gorilla thing. whatever. maybe ill put a scalple to my monitor and carve it out.   Summer is repetitive, blogging doesnt work so well in the sumer, but hark, 3 more weeks and school raises its ugly head back up.  Ive been getting tons of random bug bites over the last few days. i NEVER get bug butes, but it seems there are at least 2 new ones every day now, and the weird thing is they are ALL on my left arm except for one on my right hand and another on my left ear. at first i thought i might have the chicken pox again or something, but its concentration to the left arm seems to rule that out. and they arent spots, they are just bumps. maybe ill just cut my left arm off.  tip for the day: fill a water bottle with gasoline and seal it up, then run down carmel beach looking for someone with a fire and throw it in. be sure to run far away as you will be wanted for murder.
