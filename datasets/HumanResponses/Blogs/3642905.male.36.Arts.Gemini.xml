      I got the job!  So, I'll be out around the city this summer working as an art restorer/ art conservation dude.  The gig starts July 5th.  And it pays well!  During the interview I learned that the City was looking for someone with bronze casting experience, and had worked in some manner with art.  So there I was, standing around doing not a whole lot, and they hire me.  I'm gassed about the whole thing.    Meanwhile the band is prepping for Hamilton games.  We learned from some listeners in Georgetown that we didn't sound as bad as we thought - in fact, some folks were shocked that Braemar picked up third while we waddled around down near 8th - it's just that we don't have the numbers.  So our beautiful tone and focused playing with limited mistakes apparently is not what the judges want to hear, huh?  Anyway, this weekend is about giving the judges nothing to complain about, not winning anyways, and walking to the beer tent after to hear that classic line that Black Water has become so used to, "How come you didn't win?  You guys were incredible!"    Then it's off to Embro for solos on July 1st, and then our last games of the year, Kincardine for the long  weekend....

       urlLink    Ok, I promise, (maybe) that this will be the last metal pic...  So here's a photo looking into the gas vent, which is also where we load (or charge) the metal when melting it - the ingots are sitting on the furnace lid to heat and hopefully release any moisture (molten metal explodes when water is added.)  You can see that I just charged an ingot and it's beginning to sink down into the crucible.  &nbsp; urlLink

      90 years ago all of the arts of the West – visual, literary, and aural - stood up and stared at the state of the world and declared that Man had gone mad.      At first admonishing the moral structure of the 20th Century and then declaring that the Modern, schizophrenic man had been born (following the path of Nietzsche and Freud), artists rejoiced in their ability to freshly depict the new mind of humanity.  Romanticism, at last, was finally swept away.  The new themes: War, construction, science & technology.  Politics.  Optics.  Architecture & design.  Destruction.      This was all fine and good until the middle of the century; it had, after all, been 40 years. It was time for a little introspection.  Artists turned their spectacles inward to study the subtle nuances of language and linguistics (following the path of the Vienna Positivists and the Parisian Scholars) in a new method of exploring and comprehending Man’s - now obviously a constant – state of alienation.     Conceptualism was born from this linguistic study, and the lens shifted from contemplating the relationship of culture and the individual into an attempt to define all that art could be, and comprehend, if possible, what art could not be.  The first proved difficult, the later somewhat impossible.   Artists began to read, and it was fashionable to read along with them, for failure for not having read ( something, anything ) presented the assuredness of not getting it; or, at least, of not being able to pontificate on the subtle references to such-and-such and so-and-so.  Artists stopped making stuff and began to show maps, studies, locked galleries….    For artists and their patrons all of this was good.  There was interaction, a faith in philosophy, a sense of shared adventure and an exploration into a world uncharted.   To boldly go…   At first, a few good wars to admonish, later a new modern man to explore.  And then a cold war that began to flicker in the background that provided ample light to paint by, and more than enough shadow to slide politically.    But how long could anyone listen to anybody express the nuances of linguistic exploration without any physical doing?  Art, after all, was as much about looking as thinking.  It was time to show the tangible by-products of all these thought-games.  The 80s came and with it a new state of hyper-doing was born.  The artist moved back into the studio, and began, lo and behold, to make things.  And in those 15 seconds, everything spiralled to a halt.  The artist, reclining in the studio, writing poetry, practicing that new dance step, editing the next novel, and painting pretty pictures, became an icon; a very wealthy, if not exactly a rich, icon.  Artists of every kind retreated to the gallery and the music hall and the publisher they once shunned; the agent and the collector were reborn, the critic re-ignited, and the audience was supposed to show up at openings on Thursday from 6 ‘til 8 for the wine and cheese party.  But, alas, the adoring fan of the arts had taken this moment to turn on CNN and watched a new war (the first on closed-circuit TV) and – while catching up on the re-runs - began to wonder how long  Cheers  really would air for.     90 years after this story began more than several turbine engines collided into steel and concrete.  Thank God for CNN this time, for every artist in the West declared that this moment was too close, too emotional, too personal, to even consider as subject matter.  Best to leave this one to the media.  The arts – all of them - failed with the finesse of a little boy beaten up behind the schoolyard bicycle-rack for his lunch money.  The artist retreated to a remote farmer’s field, surrounded by a small group of spectators and a few unsuspecting passers-by.    What is to be done?  The artist obviously dropped the ball.  No blaming the judge here – the finger-work was shoddy, no effort was made to present anything that even resembles a performance; nobody even bothered to tune-up.  Artists – all of them - placed last for good reason: they don’t even bother to show up.

       urlLink    OK, one more pic of the metal stuff.  Here we are pouring the bronze into the ceramic shell molds.  That's George facing you in the photo, and I'm the guy closest to the camera...  We're at the beginning of the pour here, so the bronze is somewhere around 2150 degrees farenheit.  And yes, that's what metal looks like when it's really hot...  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    This is one of my sculptures.  The LED reads "Beautiful Luminous Sculpture for Ever - Present Love" - which is also the title.  The weird green stuff in the vertical tube is dacromet 320, and is liquid chrome - thanks to my friend Larry who used to work at Dupont Labs.  It bubbles merrily, thanks to one of those things that you put in a fish tank to ensure that there's oxygen in the water for the fishies...  &nbsp; urlLink

       urlLink    Here's a really cool pic of the green flame leaping out of the gas vent at the top of the furnace when we're melting the bronze for a pour.  The temperature of the flame is around 2200 degrees farenheit....  &nbsp; urlLink

      Well, the order of of play is up for Hamilton.  I do the piobaireachd at about 8:30 and the march at around 10:30.  Have never played for either judge - Andrew Hayes for the piob and Donald Fagan for the march - so it will be a brand new day for me.  I'm usually more comfortable playing for a judge that I know...  but hey, what can you do?

       urlLink    Here's the band playing in competition last year in Chatham.  We managed to pull off a second place finish against some 10 or so other bands.  I'm on the other side of the circle, but if you look closely you can see the top of my hat - the really tall guy in the piping circle. &nbsp; urlLink

      Perhaps, maybe with some luck and good will from some god out there who cares a little, I might find myself restoring, cleaning, fixin' and whatever else needs to be done to bronze sculptures that have felt the cold fingers of neglect brush their not-so-shiny surfaces in this grand city of mine (that city being Toronto).   Hopefully it comes through.  I could happily wander around for the summer cleaning and repairing outdoor works, looking pretty hip as I pull up in a pick-up truck and cherry picker, hop out with my safety vest and hard hat, and then climb up and around some bronze piece.    As for the piping, there's been a lot of practice chanter work, and I feel that I am starting to get my head and my fingers wrapped around the new strathspey/reel set.  Also have The Trees of North Uist (a lovely 6/8) coming along just fine, and a couple of funky hornpipes that my friend Dave wrote are shaping up as well.  But it has also been raining pretty much all the time lately, so the piping in the park has slowed to a crawl.    No weddings yet this year; just had an anniversary gig cancelled...  Not much going on.  Good thing I didn't invest in that pager.  But we might have a new tenor drummer for the band's outing to Hamilton.  That would be good, seeing as we got shafted for not having tenors in Georgetown.

       urlLink    Here I am at work - at the bronze foundry - placing the crucible back in the furnace after we have poured....  Pretty dramatic pic, but it's really just the cardboard we put on the floor of the furnace (so the crucible doesn't stick) catching fire.  &nbsp; urlLink

      Well, actually it was last week, as I was prepping for the Georgetown games.  The police found a guy not too far from where I practice who had, in a fit of madness, sliced his belly open (sepuku, I guess, in Japan) and had, somehow, despite the good weather and lots of traffic, managed to avoid detection for several days.  He was found by a dog, and a very surprised owner of dog...  So, anyway, this corner of the park has been closed.  Which I suppose is a good thing.  Kind of creepy.    Georgetown sucked.  I waited almost 3 hours for my solo - it's really difficult to keep a bagpipe in top playing form for that long, as you wait for your turn in front of the judge - and I played like crap.  Nerves, too long a wait, and feeling really rushed as the largest band in Ontario started to walk onto the field for massed bands.  But the judge was kind, and said nice things on the sheet.    And the band playing faired no better.  The heat of the sun killed us - half the band was in the sun, and when those guys felt their chanters drift we all kind of fell apart.  Too bad.  Now we have to kick ass in Hamilton.     And that's the week so far...

      OK...  So this is the new blog for my daily events as a piper in High Park.  High Park is the largest park in Toronto, some 400 acres, and during the competition season I'm there pretty much every day going over band material, and solo stuff, including piobs.    So far I have had one mention in a local newspaper - something along the line of "And there's a piper in the park, always seemeingly just over the hill, but he really does exist..."    So there you go...
