      I have an SQL final I need to take today. I took the pretest the other day and got a 68. I took it again last night and got an 86. Now I need to take the final 3 times. Fun fun.  School is almost out. Better hurry.  I got my 512 memory card. It holds lots of music. Yay!

      Since I could hold my head up high... etc. Grood song. Anyway, I haven't posted here in awhile. Pro'lly because I couldn't get my stupid blog to publish to my site. But now it'll publish there, so (if you aren't there) you can go to  urlLink http://madcow.applyclan.com  to see it. I just discovered Mozilla's new browser, Firefox. The Banana told me to use it, but I refused. When a project called for me to edit some CSS on a page I only had the .css file for (not html), I needed to edit the online example. firefox allowed me to do this. So I installed it, and I've made it as comfy (but more usable) as Opera. So try Firefox. I'll post more later. People are complaining that I'm not in bed yet.

      Here we go! Just started my new blog. It has an excellent design because I'm just piggybacking a blog off of Blogger.com like any other ignoramous. But it is great. Eventually I'll make my own blog. Until then, I like how this is going.

      I want to keep blogging, but it is getting hard. I've never been good at making a habit out of writing or reading things. So, I got 3 chances at getting Gmail. Three people have offered to exchange an invitation for a logo. So far I've started with one person, and I've talked to another.  Swimming feels really hard, but we've been doing easy practices... dag. I wonder... if I just type out a link here, will it turn into a link? Let's see. http://www.kirupa.com/developer/mx/lineart.htm How bout without http? www.kirupa.com. Here goes nothing. Remind me to stop by again tomorrow. Oh, family reunion. Dag. See you Monday, I guess.

      That stupid Banana gets all of the luck! Okay, here's the deal. I've got to make at least one post a day via Blogger in attempt to get my Gmail account via Blogger. I doubt it will happen to me, but we can try it out anyway.
