      its sunday and my cousin is bugging me about writting an entry so i am, i hope he is happy, he needs to get laid j/k. well i am writting an essay on social prejudice its really fun....not i really cant stand my english teacher i mean she is okay but she is the type that u will be nice to u in front of you and than talk behind your back. well i use to have a really cool spanish teacher but she switched to english but next year i might have her next year i hope i do plus if i dont she is the teacher that helps the cheerleader's its really fun though because she never was a cheerleader she was a cross country runner i think that is a really cool person she reminds me of my 8th grade history teacher some how well gtg Schardin21
