      Hey, all. This is Phil. Hi, Katie, BTW. Glad to have you on the team. So, not much to update today. People have been coming in and out of my garage dumping stuff off for the past few days. It's actually real annoying. I'm playing my  urlLink Ragnarok Online  when all of the sudden the doorbell rings and it's random people throwing stuff at me! and their all   WEAK  !!! They make me carry everything for them!   DO IT YOURSELF.  Well, not much else to report, besides this:   Dan:My cheek really hurts for no apperant reason. Maybe it is Philip's fault that it REALLY hurts for no reason I guess I am in the mood for blaming things on PHILIP.  Phil:i'd be happy to shoot you in the cheek with my AIRSOFT GUN whenever you want.     Well, cya all later!! ~Phil

      Wish I was too dead to cry My self-affliction fades Stones to throw at my creator Masochists to which I cater You don't need to bother; I don't need to be  I'll keep slipping farther But once I hold on, I won't let go 'til it bleeds  Wish I was too dead to care If indeed I cared at all Never had a voice to protest So you fed me shit to digest I wish I had a reason; my flaws are open season For this, I gave up trying One good turn deserves my dying  Wish I'd died instead of lived A zombie hides my face Shell forgotten with its memories Diaries left with cryptic entries
