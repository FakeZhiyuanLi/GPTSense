       BRI FEELS FLUFFY!!!! YAY!!!!!!!   sheesh..last night when she told me i was like, freakin out. it was hilarious. AND KAE IS MISSING OUT ON ALL THIS STUFF!!! i cant believe that!! feeling fluffy is truly a gift. it doesnt really come that often. at least not to me-but when it does happen, its great. good feeling. yep. YAY FOR BRIANNE!! LOL   analis is going on a camping trip on monday, and staying till friday. then im leaving friday and going to minnesota till tuesday. thats like, a week of not seeing her. ahhhhh!!!! AND erins leaving on sunday for the east coast, where shell be for like, 2 weeks. sheesh.   im gonna get together with erin tonight. woo hoo. i would see lynnie, but erin's gonna be gone, AND lynnies sitting in a dentist chair ALL day to get new bottom teeth for 8 grand. she already got top ones. good word.   i talked to lynnie last night on the phone for quite a while-nice conversation. she informed me that they painted her brand new house..but the color is like, pink. and we picked a color that wasn't pink. so she's all stressed, and frankly, i am too bc she cant live in a pink house. and i KNOW we didnt pick that color. ahhhhhh!! she said she'd get online after we hung up, so we could talk about exact traveling times, but she didnt, and i asume its because she fell asleep on her chair watching the "shop nbc" channel shes always watching. classic lynnie.   i've just realized that i'm at home alone, and there's a group of hispanie workers on my deck working on the renovations. hmm. how interesting. have they been here all morning? hmm.   i have to get to the mall this week so i can get somethng to wear for the reunion. but who would go with me? all of my friends are gone. not that i have alot of them. sierras here, but shes prolly still uncomfortaable with me and my actions...BRIANNE! come with me!! lol-ill talk to you about it later..   ok, hope your day goes good.

       not much to talk about...the "photo shoot" went fine, i decided to lose the fake eyelashes, they made me look...odd.    i had a scary dream about my dad last night. it seems that whenever i see him, i have a bad dream about him. hmm..   i ended the evening with talking to bri, annie, and roy. annie wants me to get some guts and call pat, bri's having issues with a certain guy, roy wants to see me tomorrow.    after that i watched big business for about the 500th time, and wrote down monologues that im particularly fond of in my marilyn notebook. i love that movie.    gosh, boring day. i had it all planned out that it was gonna be exciting, and id do my new ab workouts, and cardio, and maybe get on the bike and everything. but no, im a fat lazy ass with no life.

       photo shoot tomorrow..i'm actually kind of pumped..im gonna wear fake eye lashes. lol. bri says theyre a pain in the tush but im still excited.    i texted pat today a little bit, nothing really interesting..i though ti saw him pull into del monte, but he didnt answer my text when i asked him if that was him. oh well.    went to kiwi's today..nana picked me up. i ate some food, watched days of our lives, and discovered a picture of my step uncle in his senior photo, which i might add was remarkably comical. i got a good laugh out of that one.    mother picked me up after she got off work, and then we stopped by boppy's to say hello. we talked about minnesota, dad, money, and how stressed he is because of work.    as i was about to leave, guess who pulls up? none other than good old dad, himself. when i saw him, he gave me this look, like..."oh shit, what the hell is she doing here? now i'm gonna have to deal with this..oh god..." or at least thats what i got from it. my mom said that she should probably close the door and stay out of it, in hopes of preventing a fist fight from taking place. he came up the stairs and hugged me, and informed me that he was sick, so don't come too close. boppy continued with trying to convince him into going to the family reunion, to which i responded with "don't even try", because everyone knows that hes not gonna come. after i said bye to boppy, and he went inside, my dad and i were just looking at eachother. it was like, an awkward..silence. very weird. he gave me a hug, and told me "call the house sometime, cassie has been talking about you lately and itd make her happy." ok. wtf. that was the most awkward encounter ive ever experienced with my father. it was like he was nervous, and he was really really wanting it to be over with and for me to leave. i was explaining it to mother in the car, and how i cant believe that they were ever married or were in love. she responded with, "he used to laugh, and he used to smile, and make jokes."    yeah. youd be really lucky to see larry eugene boughton do that these days. if you do, youve been blessed. good for you. cause it sure as hell doesnt happen anymore.    all in all, it was a depressing day. hopefully tomorrow will be better. i think i say that every day. oh well, at least i have hope. i guess thats all that matters.

       more dramatic occurances took place today with sierra and her boyfriend james. id rather not get into it.    i made chocolate chip pancakes today and have come to the conclusion that i suck at cooking. hopefully i'll marry someone who can. i woke up this morning, feeling miserable, and seriously thinking that patrick had given me his cold. i started to feel better and assume i'll feel like shit yet again tomorrow morning. lookin forward to it.    i scheduled a photo shoot with nana on thursday. i've got to figure out what to wear, and what to do with my face and hair. ugh. great.    now i'm talking to lynnie on the telefono about ms. mccown, the family reunion coming up next weekend, my dad, and how her car was sold. she commented and cracked me up:    "well at least a young girl has my car instead of a chick with 50 children and our lady of guadalupe bumper stickers" LOL    this friday is mom and dad's ex 16th anniversary. wonderful, that should be a really happy day.   i'm just full of wonderful and positive energy today aren't i? lol-  i could really use a self esteem boost right about now.     i'm hoping for an  eventful day tomorrow that consists of me putting on clothes and getting the hell out of the house.      i'll keep praying. for that, and that the oscar meyer weiner song will get out of my head. as johnny would say.."late"     &nbsp;   Carmelkayla: hows wils    airbear1217: he's in tahoe    Carmelkayla: snowboarding?    airbear1217: kayla.    that one gave me a good laugh.     &nbsp;   "everytime ive ever believed in a happy ending ive gotten severely fucked."-brenda chenowith   "i've tried eyelashes, wishbones, stars, and even throwing loose change in small bodies of water..but no matter how hard i wish..and how hard i try..nothing seems to happen."-kayla suzanne boughton

       spent the whole weekend with analis, went to roberts house, and played tennis with pat and her at the ranch yesterday. it was a really great day and i was in a really good mood until i got in trouble with sierra again like i always do for doing something that wasnt to her liking. but now im stressing cause im taking drivers ed with her in august, and now we're gonna be all like...weird with eachother because apparently, i disgust the woman. AND to top it off she has my pink tommy hilfiger skirt that ive never worn yet and id really like to get it back. ahhhhhh   yesterday i forgot my phone in pat's car, and he had to come out to the casa to bring it to me. i swear that i didnt leave it in there on purpose. but it was a really good excuse to&nbsp;see him again. ;) wink wink.   i tried calling him earlier today and he didnt answer his phone. grrrrrr   alex came over today for a short amount of time. it was fun..i guess. he cleaned my room, and ive now come to the conclusion that hes the worst bedmaker ive ever witnessed. we did like, 3 wishbone things. u know when you pull on either side and make a wish? well he got the big side twice, and i got the big side once. i wonder what that means. after he left i fell asleep on the couch watching something on the discovery channel about ghosts in lighthouses. now im hoping that erin will come over and keep me company tonight so we can renew the bonds of soul sisterhood cause its been a while.   my neck hurts. i gotta get adjusted.   over and out muchachos.    &nbsp;  "everytime we lie awake   after every hit we take   every feeling that i get   but i havent missed you yet"   i dont know who the hell sings that song but i gotta tell ya, i love it    &nbsp;

       erins leaving for tahoe tomorrow. yes. yes she is. which means that she wont be here on sunday, when we go to white rock to spend the night in tents. bummer. bri will be busy with rehersals, analis is getting her wisdom teeth pulled, and i havent talked to sierra. oh god. i might have to resort to asking a male. oh dear.   im in the process of telling alex the prologue to beauty and the beast..although he doesnt know its the prologue of beauty and the beast. he thinks its just some story. i started off with, "once upon a time, there lived a prince in a shining castle. although the prince was spoiled..no...had everything his heart-MOTHER @#$*er!!!"   what a wonderful fairy tale to tell your child.   after that i had to get the lyrics online. now im about to read the words.    he cant believe that he knows what it is.   HELLOOOO its like the best movie ever.&nbsp;how could you not know what it is? sheesh. what is the world coming to?   tomorrow im supposed to get together with analis and work out at the ranch. hopefully that plan will follow through.   ok. im gonna go now. have a romy and michele day     &nbsp;

       ok, am i the only one who is truly confused to utter extremes about how to work this website?     &nbsp;  lets see..today i was unplesantly woken up by a telemarketer, who at first i thought was alex, until he said "this is jerome from the monterey county herald, how are you this morning?". i responded with closing my eyes, groaning, and then hanging up the phone. i then called carrie, my aunt, and arranged for her to pick me up after i took a shower and got myself ready for the day. we went to the tin cannery, a very depressig mall of worthless stores (except for a couple) and looked at shoes and purses and clothing items at nine west. very depressing when you shop without money. i later went to a&nbsp;see napoleon dynatmite for the second time&nbsp;with bri, alex, and some other people that i didnt know. oh well. i soon rtealized that natalie and donnie were in the same theater. nat and i met up in the bathroom and chit chatted about who we were with, and how funny the movie was. after that mother picked me up from the theater, and took me to her old work-stokes restaurant, so i got to see all these people from my past that i spent so much time with as a child. how emotional. unfortunately, i didnt get to see this mexican waiter that ive known forever..and i was really looking forward to it. hes really sweet and he looks like a mouse. his name is ciso.   now i'm here, in my room, wanting analis to come over to watch the butterfly effect with me, and singing pieces of me and dixie chick songs. ah what a life i lead. gota love it. when i sing, i just tune out of the world and enter a place in my mind where no one else goes. its just for me. my mind runs away with me and i think about my future, and fame, and singing and acting and everything i want to be and want to do. i know, it sounds like im on crack.    ok. i better go. talk to you tomorrow.    &nbsp;  "i said, i wanna touch the earth   i wanna break it in my hands   i wanna grow somethin wild, and unruly   i wanna sleep on the hard ground   in the comfort of your arms   on a pillow of blue bonnets   and a blanket made of stars..."   -dixie chicks, "cowboy take me away"    &nbsp;  doesnt sound too bad to me.    &nbsp;  "how do you know, everything im about to say, am i that obvious? and if its written on my face, i hope it never goes away..."    &nbsp;  i think thats how it goes. haha.    &nbsp;

       WOW that took forever...I kept screwing up and screwing up and looking&nbsp;at the&nbsp;"Help" sections&nbsp;and it just got me more and more confused. SHEEESH! But, thanks to Bri,&nbsp;I got through it and now here I am..   Had a boring day today, I got up, had a bagel, watched Days of Our Lives...ok this whole capitol letter thing is really bothering me..ok. umm and then i lost rodney. for like an hour. and i was out on the back porch in my PE shorts and a tank top wearing no makeup and my glasses screaming at the top of my lungs over and over again, "RODNEY!!! COME HERE!!! come on come here, ill give you a cookie!!" (cookie aka bone). it took forever. (hence the title..i dont even know what hence means)so then mother had to come home and get in these huuuggeee boots and truck her way up in the poison oak and look for him..and of course, once she got there, he came back..ugh. then i had to give the little twit a bath. he made me mad.   jacob told me today that i should try under water basket weaving.   alex is talking to me on the phone right now about peacocks. and now hes bugging me to go on fandango.com to get tickets to napoleon dynamite. (he wants to go with bri and me) oy vey.   ok..hes bugging me alot about movie tickets..ahhhhhhh..   over and out at 11:44pm.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;

       well i havent written in a while.. went to the concours with alex today..my feet hurt like a biatch. oh well, it was worth it. very interesting, and got even more interesting at the after party when i met this old actor guy that i LOVE. alex set it all up. what a great guy. i loove you pike!! lol i tried to sneak out last night, and realized that either my ass is too big to get out of the window, or the window is just too small to climb out of. and also, the drop down from my window looks ALOT bigger at nighttime if you actually look down from my window then looking up at it from outside. it was actually kind of funny..pitch dark, my legs leg strangling and wiggling out of a window, knocking down pictures, with voices.."OUCH!!!" "F@#$!!" " "RODNEY SHUT UP!" and so then i gave up at like 230, and pat was still down at the first fork by my driveway...GRRR my thighs and my damn buttcheeks. UGH pat might come over tomorrow though..hope so.. and a group of us are goin to the fair on tuesday night..so i dont know if its a couple deal or what but thats what analis told me.. theres so much more pressure with couple deals..ugh ok i think im outta here, i got like 4 hours of sleep last night, and im way exhausted from the concours.. until next time..

       bad day today. spent the night on saturday with erin, and had a really good time renewing the soul sisterhood. it was fun to laugh. i dont laugh like that with anyone else, and it felt really good cause i hadnt laughed for a while. so we said our goodbyes, as i wont be seeing her for two weeks, and then i went to analis's for a while. it was ok, kinda boring, but fun. we we watched depressing romantic comedies and got depressed.    i talked to pat while i was there, on the phone, and i WAS going to see him tonight, but no, mother wouldnt hear of it. well first, she said "sure, if im here, tahts fine", but then like she always does, she got my hopes up, and then SHATTERED THEM. so i told him id call him back, and i didnt. im so bad. i feel....like shit. to be frank. all my friends are gone. roy, will, analis, erin. well thats not all of them, but you know. my mom was in a REALLY bad mood today cause shes pmsing. SHEESH!! we didnt get to go to a party today that i actually wanted to go to..alot of her old friends (the fun, nice ones) were gonna be there and i love all of them. but no, no. she had cramps and just COULDNT take midol. good god. sorry if that grosses anybody out. (particularly males). and i put some clothes on hold that i tried on at macys that of course, i wont get. ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh   now mother has the day off tomorrow, and says that we're gonna have a "girl day". WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? she says that all the time and nothing happens. ugh. i spent the majority of the evening being pissed at my mom and crying. i know, lame. but it really sucks when you really really like a guy, and your mother has absolutely no kindness about it. its just like, mom, were you ever a teenager girl? did u ever like someone and you couldnt get like, their smile or their eyes or soemthing out of your head? do u know what that FEELS like?! ahhhhhh!!   so now i've just downloaded some SERIOUSLY depressing music, and im listening to it thinking about everything going wrong right now. how lame!!      "everytime our eyes meet   this feelin inside me   its almost more than i can take"      ok can anyone here agree with me that that is like, one of the most depressing yet sweet songs EVER?
