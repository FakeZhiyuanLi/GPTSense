      ...I have come to the ultimate conclusion that life would be much less complicated if all involved would adopt the fatalistic attitude,and accept what was predetermined. Although that particular existence would be quite fruitless,we might then feel secure. Maybe then, people like me would have a  right  to complain about the injustice of it all, as opposed to now, when we do,regardless of whether we have license to, or not. Yet,when you really contemplate it, would we  really  feel any more secure? Knowing you are being hurried down a blind past, knowing nothing of how it may end. Unsure of whether anything you accomplished,attempted, or felt passionate about would mean anything in your inevitable end. Can living ever be simple? Have we lived in this somewhat mildly predictable,yet,sometimes extremely random method so long,that the inherent unpredictability in the behavior of a natural system would overwhelm us?...

      We live in a time of rampantly spreading, highly contagious emotional issues, and everyone's got something. Inability to commit, dishonesty, loneliness, fear, neediness... These conditions,which are potentially crippling in ones ability to function in a relationship, are not inherited, but developed. These are, unquestionably, learned behaviors. The insecurities are present in people,because, somewhere,at one point,someone  made  them that way. This only further proves the point of the cruelty of humans, by their very nature. Emotional abuse... blah,blah,blah ...The point is,the emotionally fucked up, go on to fuck someone else up,and the cycle continues. Consider the casualties...Most people have more emotional baggage then an airline luggage check. There seems to be no reasonable solution.Short of quarantining all of the emotionally ailing, to protect them from others, and themselves, there is no way around it. In the age of this plague-like epidemic, we are all marked and infected...

      I fear that, to Andrew, I may very well be invisible. Which was not what I was hoping for,in the least. He intrigues me, amuses me, enlightens me, fascinates me, makes my flesh tingle when he touches, makes my heart want to explode...And he knows nothing of this. I want him to understand. I need some sort of connection. He melts me; I could burst.

       The charade that everyone has taken to so quickly has grown old. Depressed, self defeating, theatrical, cutters, lushes, bulimics,sex fiends. Going to great lengths to make themselves appear 'deep' and 'complex'. Inflictions just for show. Taking a little bit of sadness,and running with it. Whether the objective is sympathy, the dramatic effects they have at their disposal, exaggeration and exploitation of every even-the-slightest-bit-natural emotion...Turning minor discontent into hopelessness and despair...Slight annoyance to rage and anger. How did we begin this? The burning desire to hurt, or at least appear so?

      Change is usually for the worst. Well, maybe it has the best intentions to begin with,but, rarely does it end well...But, as they say, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions"...Prime example:..Sunny Day Real Estate..They dared to be different..Jeremy Enigk was just a teenager with an ethereal falsetto, and a painful honesty. At the release of  Diary  they had given indie kids some hope...Hope that not everything honest was gone. Then, the heavenly voice became a born-again Christian...It was all downhill for there...Musically,at least...Not to say anything is wrong with Christianity, but, it wasn't the faith that ruined their once-incredible work. After this discovery, the lyrics became less honest, and more proselytizing...Evangelical...He was no longer being truthful, but only saying what was expected,now that he was saved...Yet, I see no problem in believing...I'm just sad that it had to end..I don't know where I was going with that tangent...

      I was venturing to the video store tonight, when I saw an old green mustang I'd seen before... I went in, and saw the usual employee, to whom I gave the nickname Grizzly Addams, was present...Then, standing there, looking absolutely gorgeous, was a young man in a black Used t-shirt, long raven hair in his eyes. He was beautiful. We walked around, accomplishing nothing, because we were fawning over him. We picked out a movie, checked out,and went to the car...As they were driving off,they waved...Then, I realized, that I used to know him...His name was Dustin,and he used to do theater stuff. He is so gorgeous...I hope to see him again...  [Exeunt.]

      Well, its been over a week, and I remember very little of the details. To be in the presents of one who can see you have something on your mind, and being unable to bullshit your way out of the "What are you thinking?" inquisition is exceedingly difficult. He is the cause of my heavyheartedness, yet, the one who could relieve me...By saying what I want to hear. Which is exactly what my problem seems to be...There must be someone who would tell me exactly what I want(possibly need) to hear...Yet, it would be meaningless coming from any other...He has, easily, addled me more than any other could even attempt...This problem stemmed directly from our very eerie likeness, from a physcological standpoint. He has been the only one to ever 'figure me out' and I, him. As a result, no games, no facades, no bafflement with bullshit. Its truly hard to be totally honest.

      10:30 AM, Saturday morning...I just got home...I left at 7:30 last night. Do I remember a lot of last night? No. Though, I should...I am,after all,sXe. I remember having a surplus of energy....That was fun. I found James...And, upon seeing him again, realized that,not only have I gotten over him, but that he was all style,no substance. He was never real. But, I think I've been fortunate enough to find someone who is...

      Sitting in the library when I should be in class, getting educated. But, its P.E....I'll spare you my opinion on that...James is still missing, I may never find him...Maybe that would be to the benefit of both. Maybe its his erradic behaviors, or his undeniable charms, but, nonetheless, bad news. Yes,that's it....My dear friend,Sarah, had an interesting experience this last weekend....She was plastered,in the back of a car,with a groups of X's, making....Interesting comments,and drunk dialing...I got great enjoyment at her expense.

      It seems as though all his wrongs are forgotten when we are alone. The fight we had,or what he did is pushed far out of mind when he touches me the way he does. Its neither healthy,nor reasonable that when he does what he does,he is perfect. Yet,how could he not be...Its incredible when he bites,scratches,pulls my hair,licks,beats,bleeds,strangles,slaps me the way he does. Its sick....This I know....Yet,I don't care in the least. Whether its considered cruel,destructive,sadistic,or evil matters not.....fucking choke me! I want it! That sounds a lot like our relationship in general.

      He disappears. I locate him. Approximately one day later, gone again. If I didn't love him, I wouldn't be here,...Yet,he knows nothing of this. He loves no one. And, what are his intentions? He told me before,yet, was he being truthful? Can I trust him? Could I be any more addled?

      Petty vandalism is never worth the repercussions. Whether the intent behind it is good-natured,or laced with malice, you will feel the wrath. I was told this,(speaking of the blog in general,of course)is a "cry for help" and a "plea for everyone to stay real". Hmmm...Tonight, the carnival. Strangely enough, today, my thoughts are of Kyle...What does this mean?

      To all who read my thoughts as casually as the morning paper, my deepest sins I confess: I love him...Oh,yes, it gets better...He loves me. I will not bite my lip,and forego proclaiming all that has happened, over a realized fear of who may consume this. I want him. Hold me down, bite me, choke me....My mind is racing.

      This is probably the most unhappy I've been in quite some time. I despise how angry I am. I don't want to speak to him. I will not change and I will not be nice. My life is in constant turmoil. I,and others like me, put ourselves in situations of chaos to the highest degree. Complaining incessantly about it. Returning to it. Almost as if we don't know how to exist in a life without it. I doubt I could... When, even for the briefest of times, my life is peaceful and serene, I somehow sabotage it. Which makes me question, Could I handle a life without a certain level of this chaos? As far as I have seen, I can't. I desire it, but, could I maintain it? All I truly desire is James, and he is nowhere to be found. I'm sorry Morisseys' birthday was such an unhappy one; It, of all days, should have been a joyous one. I will make it up,next year.

      Seasonal distraction is in full effect; I accomplish little or nothing. I'm greatly looking forward to this weekend. Staying out, sleeping in...Maybe James will honor me with his company. It seems as though everyone can find something about him,to dislike him for. Unfortunately, I cannot. He's sporadic, hyper, has little to no attention span, his liquid dancing skills, etc. Yet I find no reason to dislike him. Wow, I definitely need to find something else to consume me. I promise I will write about something else,tomorrow. K-Luv likes Modest Mouse! Yay!

      Tuesdays and Thursdays: best days of the week for blogging. Why? Because, here, its peaceful and quite, and I get out of my mediocre,second-rate classes. This week may be decent,after all. Sarah and I have a house to ourselves until Sunday. James is missing,again(that's becoming very redundant) I've often questioned why I constantly put myself in this position. But,we all  know  why. Today, I gauge my ears...That makes me happy.

      It seems as though almost everyone has over-stepped their boundaries with me, this past week. James and I are finally getting along(surprised? So was I....When he showed me the tattoo he had recently given himself...Of my initials) Brit has pushed the limits,as well. I grow annoyed much easier of late. Is the request for even a minimal amount of reliability too much? I was told I am "impossible,for the sake of being difficult." and that I "speak a cryptic language." Could this be true? From where I stand, what separates you and I ,what holds everything in,and keeps you out,is simply a door. No key, arson, magic, or force is needed to open in. There's no bolt, chain,stop,or handle. Just push. From where I stand,its easy. But, then again, anything is easy if you know how to do it. Its only 8:46 in the morning,and I'm already bored. So this is what it feels like to be young,and tired of sex.

      My only desire now is to die. I am no longer worthy of the explanation, time, or effort of anyone. Brandon refuses to talk to me. I am unsure as to what I have done wrong, and, I have no means of making amends. He is everything, and if injecting bleach is the only way to prove that, I am more than prepared. Once again, I fucked things up. I have nothing.

      Sitting two seat to the left of the eccentric physics teacher, staring blankly at the screen. This would be typical of a Thursday, but, its Wednesday...Today, while watching "Pirates of the Caribbean" in French class, I decided I should pursue a career in such a field. Thievery,murder and such...I may also be suited to taking up a job as a con artist...Either occupation would be mentally stimulating. The only possible issue would be my fear of the ocean, which comes from my mild agorophobia. The little spat between Sarah and I wages on. The cause still unknown. But, it continually comes back to how she handles conflict. She will be upset for some particular reason; Instead of informing you of what you did, or how to mend it, she isolates herself and pouts for days upon days, being snide, until she gets over it. Acts as if nothing has happened.  Philosophical question of the day: Is it possible to live a fatalistic life?

      This is a terrible end to a good day. I am, yet again, miserable. But, this time, it wasn't the usual suspects that have caused my discontent. I've questioned my life quite a bit, today. Lots has happened, and, the only thing that has changed is  now, its something different that's making me miserable. I was very prepared to leave, the clincher was that I was not allowed to do so. I will not bite my tongue! I am still ready to go at any moment. Whether or not I will be any happier is unknown to me. James told me I could stay with him, but, I doubt I can handle that. Despite how often he says he loves and respects me, I know what he is, and what he does. And, even though I am aware of these facts, I find it easier to deny that they take place as long as I do not have to witness it. Call it silly; call it what you will, but, its far easier then facing what I know. All I desire is serenity.

      Its incredibly difficult to reach someone who lives in a world totally unlike your own...Or so it seems. That is how I feel about James...I would tell him, if only I could reach him. He could have my secrets...Then, he wouldn't need to ask me whether or not I was his. I realize that the chaos I live in now...Really  is  my choice. I continually choose it, so I must live it. I loathe it, and see my inevitable demise,as a result of it. Yet, I push on, foolishly rationalizing that the 'here and now' will be worth the catastrophe to come. I, without the slightest bit of hesitance, put everything on the line. No regrets. Because, I'm reckless. I see it coming, like a train wreck, a head on collision. You know how it will end, you see the spools of fate turning, life ending, chests falling, and you could swerve, duck, leap, cover...But, its all too intense. You do nothing, and die. Because you were too caught up.

      If I have ever, in the history of my life, been as or more miserable than I am right now, I will politely recede my point and put a bullet in my head. My discontent is apparent, because I know longer can conceal it. Everything is out of hand. Life is a gun, loaded with a single bullet. You pull the trigger knowing that eventually it will go off, but, you have no choice. You must continue... click, click ..Until the  click  is stifled. Then, its partial relief, its over. No longer do you dread the moment it will go off. I pray for that day to come soon. He broke me down, coaxed me into trust, and removed all barricade I had, to keep the "Harmful one's" out. He turned out to be the one I should have feared. He has begged, and pleaded with me, to stay. And, I wanted to... I would have given everything simply for the  will  to stay. When it rains it pour...I've braved one storm after another, and I have no will to push on. I will accept all, because I am too worn down to do any different.

      Another amazing night. Went to a show, met a gorgeously hot boy in a band. His name is Mark; he showed me his van, where we got really, really close... So close that he...Leaned in slowly, lightly bushing the hair from my face, tilting my chin slightly,..I felt his light,shallow breathing gently caressing me... So close that we...Could feel eachother's hearts beating...Pulsing so rapidly...That we...ALMOST kissed. I know, I know, that story should have ended better,but that's just how my luck goes. I almost had it..Then, time expires and I am rushed off by friends, leaving him there (though NOT by choice) And, now I'm sad, because, I may never see him again. But, not ALL hope is lost. He may e-mail me, which would be great. That would make me very happy. I really like him, a lot.

      Despite the fabulous night I had (which consisted of some heavy making out with Elijah) I thought it was only fitting, being I hadn't thought of this before, to make a list of all of the boys who have ever broken my heart...Going form least to most crushing...Not that all of them weren't,but,you get the idea...  7) Kyle(he knows nothing of this) 6) Chad(not horrible,but, bad enough) 5) Chris(enough said) 4) Vinn(he's pretty far up on the list, but, I've moved on) 3) Andrew(I don't hold it against him, there was nothing he could do) 2) Martin(..Really cut deep, and, occasionally, I can still feel a sting) 1) This place is reserved for only the most skillful, and cunning. The most vicious and heartless..A place saved for the one who went farther than breaking my heart...Bent, tore, snapped, set it aflame, ground it in to a fine powder, and snorted it...This menace is the one I loved most...James Ellis.

      I spent the day with Elijah...Alone, yesterday. It was very nice. Today has been quite uneventful. Hopefully tonight will be better. I conversed briefly with Brit today, and,in typical fashion, we bashed, slandered, and verbally crucified James in every way possible. Always amusing. I feel so heartless taking joy in his misery and jealousy, but, I just can't resist. I think I may be falling in love with Elijah. Yesterday, I found that we had something else to add to the list of the thousands of things we have in common. We have the same birthday. July 27. What does this mean? Any thoughts? Yes, I know its sickeningly pink, but, I desperately needed a change.

      Tonight was great. Elijah and I spent the night together, and Sarah came over for a little while but left, because I wouldn't abandon Elijah just to go driving around with her.

      Traded the usual plans for spending the evening with Elijah and his friends.

Things seem to be going my way, for once. This is all so new.

      I found my serenity; my contentment. Leaving the drama far behind. Sweet Elijah is mine, and I am his. He helped me find this felicity. All the storms having been pacified, I can sleep easy. I have tasted love, and living... I will no longer simply survive.

      It has been a while. I am guilty of being lustful, and a nymph. I have alot more sex than most people should, but have no complaints. Sexual expression is very healthy. Agree? I think I may be in love with Elijah. It is a distinct possibility. We are very happy together, and have fun. I saw my ex, K.C., a few days ago. I was very curious as to what I saw in him. The only word that really could describe him is 'bland'. Its short. Simple. Direct. Truthful. He is just  bland .

       I feel a change come over me now, and am effected greatly. In the past I've used this as a platform for my cynicism and confusion. But, being that I am no longer bitter about the events that mark my past (yet confusion comes and goes, as it has and will) I feel it would be over-staying a welcome to continue this any further. I simply have less and less to whine about. The addelment I feel now is not negative or extremely pressing. I have finally 'moved on'. I am grateful that I had an outlet for my rants and over-dramatized sob stories, and am thankful for everyone who took time to read them. I still have decions to make, and things to mend, but, I can handle it now. Let coincidence take you.  I'm going to leave this exactly how it is. Spelling errors and all. Because anything else would be less than perfect.
