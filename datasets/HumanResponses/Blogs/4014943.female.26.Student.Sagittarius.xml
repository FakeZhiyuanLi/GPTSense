      So, it has been a few days....bad bad me. well this weekend was a little crazy but friday went hung out with Shawn. It was really nice and i had some AWSOME sex:D. Umm saturday i ws up at about 8 am went home at about 830 am as i crashed at shawns house. My mom was all frantic so i got mckayla dressed and me dressed in 10 min no breakfast . got her to swimming lessons. the after her lessons had her dressed in 5 min and scooted her out to shawns dad.They agreed to watch her so i could do what is called spinning for an hour. Went into the  class and felt really guilt as she was the lady who had made up the workout regime for me and i had only done one day last week.(pathetic) There is always this week. Died in spinning i missed the week before also . walked 20 min to shawns house. then had a shower after about 5 min wait for mckayla and everyone to get back. I then went to my house got dressed was frantically looking fora  piece for her tricycle. couldn't fine it:(. rushed to the car we went to the mall , costco and the meat store then back to shawns house. By this time it was 430 i am exahusted oh well gotta keep going. so did stuff with mckayla in the backyard ect. We finally went home at 9. Sunday was a little easier but things were more moody as my friend had borrowed my exspensive rollerblades and hadn't returned them when she said she would. I got them later that night. so i was grumpy making shawn grumpy. But we finished most of mckaylas kinda house that shawn and his dad made for her.(finished painting). today is laundry:P  floors and litter day then out we go. to the park. I am hoping to get a run in and weights today as the gym babysitting wasn't open today:s. Hopefully tmw will be more action packed again.:D

      I went for a walk and met up with my freind Celeste. Who just moved back like a month ago but i was unable to see her do to the fact of school. It was cool we went out for lunch then she rode her bike to the park and we met her there. Due to the fact she can't walk far distances because of a mortercycle accident 4-5 years ago. The only thing that turned me off of bikes yet she still rides. Oh well... Then came home and called naomi as she had called this morning to see if i wanted to go blading in Stanley park . Went out bladed from the first curve parking lot right after the navel base i think it is. We stopped at the pool and took the kids for a swim(Naomi has a little 5 month girl). I noticed mckayla  a little hot i was really worried later relized she has a bit of a fever:(.A hot lifegaurd complimented on my daughter. It was so nice outside we figure we bladed for 1.5 hours- 2hours. i did all the work as naomi had a running stroller and i had 50 pounds plus in a stroller not immpressed with the weight .Ironically enough 3 min before our destination one of the wheels fell off. I felt very budget. holding the stroller on the front two wheels as it was the back one that fell off killed my back my arms had a workout too. But to no avail i was trying to keep busy because i am extremly horny... now i am just tired and horny.Oh well i guess. Poor andrew i have been tormenting  him:D.So tmw i am going to try and get up for a 6 am run ....hopefully i will make it as i had coffee:( at like 4 or so. i hope i am not up all night. Thankfully enough i rollerbladed in my playboy bikini top to get colour. I hope mckayla is ok and damn do i need relife i have been like this since 1130 yesterday.

      I am back in action. So i have missed a few days. I am listening to some music as i do this. Right now i am listening to an ACDC mix i love it:D. Lets see I have been a little busy. More like stressed. The heat is insane so i am having a ton of trouble sleeping at night. That then affects my morning workouts:@. To Top it off i am having insane dreams and they are all about having sex with outher people and yes i am still dating shawn:s. Oh well. I am doing this insane new workout schedule and i am in fucking pain. This better give me the results i want!!!!! btw now i am listening to it's like that and that's the way it is ( run dmc) i love this song cause it is so old school.(just the type of sound it is).SO i need to go tan outside again. and start running of course:P. I am starting school again on the 7th of September. Exactly three months before my birthday:S. I am getting so old:'(. Mckayla is not sleeping well at all she is over exahusted. I am officially going off coffee this week:( welcome to my personal hell).I am so happy to i got the jenna jamison book:D.Yesterday some guy was checking me out in the gym it felt kinda good except for the fact i get mad at shawn when he is all like cool she was checking me out so i felt really guilty.I think i am going to need to make a new running tape the other one is getting a little old. I still would love to be in playboy.How pathetic but not. Oh i want this in writing to cause i will do it.... If shawn has a stripper for his bachelor party I will be doing amature night and he can't go:D...It is equal and fair. Alot of guys i know have told me how attractve i am ..but it is like how come i was only hit on in a club like mabey 5 times or rarley asked out. It is like how attractive am I really?:s iIguess I over doubt my potential in a way. oh well. i am starting to feel a better when i look in the mirror. and i miss my nightly chats with matt:(. he harrasses me and i do it back. Shawn is doing so well at work i am to proud for words. I tell him all the time how talented he is and he just doesn't get it. So i have my fingers crossed for this next opportunity. shawn and i have been talking about the pics and i have a few ideas of what i want taken. I am working out again tonight then tmw i am going to try and run and i am bike riding about 8 to 10k. I have also decide when mckayla gets older i am going into rowing .It has been a huge desire for years. Plus i am looking into dance classes for her and I . it looks like fun.But to be honest pathetically enough i still really want to learn swing dancing but i might do celtic or hip hop just for the hell of it:D. Btw everyone i talk to online you are all a blast. There was a raging party last night by my house. totally reminded me of my party days(fall down drunk).I find that i am a funny mix cause i am obbsessed with pornography type of display of sexuality as i would love to do some of it . But a huge romantic at heart. Boys remeber that girls love to be wooed all the time. My philosphy is any place or anywhere can be made romantic. Just a matter of trying.But please don't be cheesy. I dated someone like that and couldn't stand him. When guys are fall over crazy for you will be your puppy yeah annoying. Been there done that HATE it.Just rember the little tilts to the chin to give a kiss. or the pining against the wall kissing with meaning they stick in your head. well i gotta go i am going for a walk. kisses to all and carmen electra i am so going to look like you:P or lets see daisy fuentes. but gotta love pams chest ..   HOLY fuck is this wordy :s

      Today i am in an awsome mood. I went for an hour rollerblade.....But it was fuckin hot and i was dehydrated so i almost threw up. oh well. Tommorrow i am going for an hour run i am really going to get back into my groove. Shawn and i had a talk and things are cool.Mckayla is making me so proud she is doing absoulutley amazing in her swimming lessons. She isn't my baby girl anymore:(. I am going to hangout with shawns parents today so mckayla can have some papa time (shawns dad) she adores his family and i am glad she needs a functioning family around her. I am still having crazy dreams not sure what they are about but i hav eread you dream what you fear most..... that is kinda scary. I am waiting for a book to be released i am stocked about it jenna jamison. The tracy lords book was awsome.  I still really want to make my own porn magazine. We will see i am just waiting to get some cash for my tattoo and my mini disc player. I hate debt it suxs ass. I am also starting weights again tmw. i had a personal trainer make out a workout plan and then in a month change everything up... lets see if this works. I am still amazed that shawn is such a great guy. It felt really good that he knew i could pass my course only thing is when i actually hear praise and compliments it is really hard to hea them it is like my brain blocks them out because for so long in my life i was told how stupid and ugly and lazy i was. I guess it kinda wears on you.Oh well again. I am getting extremly worried about my cat though she has an eating disorder as well she emotinally eats and is becoming more overweight it has gotten worse since i had started school. I pray she doesn't become diabetic my mom had a cat that sick and i would hate to give my bubby (real name patches) needles everyday. I am amzed what one workout is doig for my sanity already. Just wiat i willbe all horny next week cause my drive will be insanly crazy again....grrreeeeaaaattt. I thin i need to buy a fuckin dildo. poor shawn. i might post pictures soon;). but the countdown still stands. Today i am proud and happy of myself i feel good just flabby it is abeautiful thing:P.

      shawn didn't want to kiss way before the head thing and yes i swallow for all of you out there:P. i just mean it is when he wants to kiss me or when he wants to have sex never when i want to . he says the timeing is always off. and some of the loneliness comes form my feelings of fat and unattractiveness i do not want to be that ugly fat mom yet that is how i feel so today i am writing out words to say everyday in the mirror and i am going to stand there naked for 10 mins and pick out 3 things i like and for every negative thign i think i have to find three positives.

      K This is my first post. Please keep an open mind and opinon. I have the worst grammar and sometimes spelling. I do not always edit my work as i write from passion how i feel at the moment and I feel sometimes if i go back and look at it i will erase things fearing people will judge. Welcome to Erin's ride please keep hands and feet in at all times as there are sharp turns and panic attacks. K i am having a shitty day already..I know what a way ti start out my blog. I am also getting used to the fact that people maybe able to read my thoughts. I find guys hard to read when you are in a relationship. It is just like i am a little different in a relationship then i am with freinds but yeah i am a hornball. I am going through a down time for several reasons i am emotional (when am i not:P), and i haven't worked out properly for a month(missing a whole week this week). As of tmw i start my workout regime again. I am going to try and run 10k or more every sunday and do my other stuff that i had a lady make for me. I slept over at Shawns last night i didn't sleep well as i had to pee every 10 min:@ freakin bladder. But i also gave him head and i love doing that but it felt so mechanical like no foreplay no anything i mean our sex life is great but i want to do more exciting things. I just want to explore and NO not with a chick or guy i have been offered a threesome with two guys i wasn't all for it. I turned it down. But it is like i am only there for his pleasure and it kinda makes me feel like i am on the outside i tried to kiss him and he was like NO. i don't know it hurts to get shot down.  It is like it is on his tearms plus latley i am feeling alone again inside like the person who shares this body is not willing to participate. My mind and body are goign in a million directions and it won't go together....but that has alot to do with no running. I fear i am losing shawn in a way because i am not exciting enough but little does he know how exciting i could be.... to a point. I am scared it is like no one around me can see how sa i am and lonley. I am also gettign scared i might become bulimic again i ahave had urges to vomit..... But i will never give into that. My fear of being fat though is so strong i could do alot of damage. my daughter is my world but i don't want this extreme obbssesion to wear off on her. Well anayways on a lighter note i will be writing poetry and hoping this can bring out my song writing again we will see. This blog is all about me my thoughts feelings wishes AND YES i really do want to be a centerfold. I love sexuality and everything it reperesents and even the fact of the plesuarble feelings you can enjoy from it. It is not shawns fault i feel like this either but it is something i have to undestand he is not extremly romantic knock me off my feet and he is very subtle he isn't one to lay it lall out on the table in a movie manner he is very much a guys guy and that iss omething i will have to accept. Damn wishful thinking. so please feel free to say something and i may post again today. I feel a bit better and my cat is cuddiling with me i will give you more info about me at a later date.... and btw when this moves pages ALL the names wil be changed for security reasons. Protecting myself and my daughter from her dad potentially finding the site with my pics on it:$ cause yes i will b e posting pics;)   urlLink http://www.geocities.com/rhodeszxc/index.html   from our freind matt you may not see me completly nude but i will be nude;)
