      Well ok, I used to play tennis at this clay court here in Singapore. It's probably the only around, so many expatriates go there for training. I met many people there, the most memorable one was this Indian boy that kept whining "It's just a game" when I beat him 6-0. There was this boy too, by the name of Alistair, that I used to play with quite often, because his training slot was around my time too.  His mom was such a nice lady, and he was really such a nice guy. When I stopped going to the courts, I never saw him again. Only today, 3 months after his untimely death, did I know about it. Apparently he went in his sleep, with no medical records, no problems the day before. The baffled the doctors, and they could find no reason.  My dad always repeats the same old catch phrase when someone dies so suddenly: "frailty of life". Honestly if he can't find something fresh to say then he should shut his trap, sometimes people feel better without the overly used 'words of wisdom'. But really this death was a real bummer. How could someone so young be taken so early with no rhyme or reason. He's about my age so I inevitably started thinking "what if it was me?"  I really don't know whether I should feel upset or glad at his death. On one hand, this guy just left his single mother standing on the edge of depression with his death. From my very short time with him I could tell there was a lot of love between the 2 of them. When something like that happens you naturally feel a little upset, but this time the feeling's different. It's this warm, fuzzy feeling in my heart that tells me not to be upset. Well actually I don't know how to describe the feeling so I just used an old and cliched catchphrase.  Those who know me would also not know that I've been thinking about death ever since I reached a certain level of maturity. All along I had feared death, feared the pain, feared the thought of going to somewhere really, really bad. Then my thoughts matured, and philosophy came into play. I knew what I wanted from this world; nothing. I've all along wanted to die an early death of old age. All along I've wanted to live a short, meaningful life; and die a painless death. I thought death by old age was the ony way death would be painless, but this death has opened up a whole new dimension for me.   I really don't know why the thought of changing places came to me. I know if I were the one to die my family would be devastated. But they have my sisters don't they? Then again I've always been the special one. The more intelligent one. The one that has the most hope in life. That poor lady had and now has no one else. I feel so sorry for her, but what can I do? If the lord were willing, if he called out my name, I think I would really not hesitate. I think I would gladly swop his place for mine.   By saying that I'm kind of implying that I have a really bad life. That's really not true. I have a really great one, but if my death could do something so miraculously good as to bring mother and son happiness, I would gladly do it. My only wish is that that could happen without me feeling pain. I'm a sucker for pain.

      Ah well...  urlLink  I'm sorry  yesterday I was all wierd and emotional. I just wasn't thinking straight because it was my last day in a place I've been living in for the past 2 years. Anyway, for those who wants my take on my day yesterday, here it is...  Well my last day at school helped me discover a very Under the Radar player in class, Benjamin Siow. I honestly did not have him on my list of targets, and he just got 1+ marks less than me in average. Well what I can tell you is that he won't be able to go UTR anymore, of he's gonna get ready to get voted off. Essentially, I won't be the one getting him exposed, I'll let the Fairplays do the job; my dearest slaves Anjan and Jason will be all over this guy once they find him out!   I was also doing some bonding with the Fairplays, through a lame coin game. But it was really nice seeing another side of them, not having to be playing the game. I was in a really good mood until a "Jenna Awardee" came into the game. Well, his name is Samuel, and his mouth shoots off like a donkey's ass once something remotely funny comes into conversation. Not to mention his mouth smells like a donkey's ass. Some very scientifically inclined people may like to compare his words to the speed of light, and his brain to the speed of sound.

      The Finale... A title that lets your thoughts run wild! After the  urlLink  American Idol  finale I'm sure quite a few of you are expecting a commentary. Sorry to those people, because I've just been so touched by the song "I Believe", and I'm gonna right about the finale of a phase in my life, and the beginning of another.  My dear friends would know that today was my last day at a place that I've detested and cursed for 2 years; the Boarding School. As I lay on my bed, the one that always seemed so uncomfortable at night but so appealing in the day, I heard the sound of something bead like falling on the floor. I looked in between the gape of the bed and the wall, and there was this glass star, the star that I had recieved on my first week here. I felt it extremely appropriate that I got the star back at the start of a new chapter in my life.  Enoch and Ken Wei helped to carry my stuff down, and him waving as my car went off reminded me of the ending of the movie "Big Fish", where the characters of the persons life waved him his last goodbye, without any tears, but instead with joy. It is today, as I wave goodbye to the shining star of Miss Barrino, that I've grown the "10 inches more" that mother has always wanted...

      Today at school was a huge mess up. Yes it was P.E. again, and I realised I could actually play Badminton... Well that wasn't really the highlight of the day, because I started to step up my little gameplan.   As I said in the earlier post, I need so badly to step up into Fairplay's shoes. Guess what people? I'm already on to it! I initiated a whole chain of jokes about Mr. Mad Devendran. I'm telling you, by the crowds that surrounded my table, I think I may be even better than I thought.  Today was also the 10th year anniversary for boarding school. Ironic really, that I announce my leaving on this day too. Anyway it seemed like a farewell party all for me. The starters were really great... Prawn salad or something like that. The clam chowder, though a far cry from my mum's standards, was far better than I expected. The rest was ok... until the horrid dessert.  Away from the food, the tiki torches outside really gave me a wierdly comforting feeling. I guess it's because there are now torches for the Survivor: OM in December. Something in the hall really didn't feel right, and it was because I was sitting next to a bunch of people that I used to be comfortable with, but I am not comfortable with anymore. I was sitting with none of my friends cause they were all serving... And I just didn't feel good. I really don't know whether it's because I'm leaving, or because I found that I had no real friends.

      Being in my class, as I realized today, is like playing a huge game of Survivor. I find it appropriate, that as a SurvivorFire writer, I compare a few significant classmates to a few of our most loved, most hated Survivors. For your information, I got back my exam results today, and some more emerged as Fairplays, and even more dropped like flies. The first person I’m doing is a guy named Ashok. He sits right next to me, laughing his ass off all day. Any Survivor idiot can tell he’s playing the game, distracting others by ridiculing the teachers. Before the exams, he was on my Fairplay list, one that really had the potential to do well, but was valiantly concealing it. When the results were returned, he dropped to a John (Marquesas) Award. He definitely outwitted the “sheep” of the class, because a countless many fell into his laughing pit, but in the end he was completely outwitted by none other than me… There are 2 Fairplay award recipients, namely Jason and Anjan. Both play a very good game, and end up far, as in as far as top 5 in class. Both conceal their capabilities very well, playing the “I’m a doofus, don’t worry about me role.” What I know is that they definitely go home to mug their heads off. Personally I fell into Anjan’s trap at the start of the year, I thought he was a lazy pig who would couch up and do nothing at home. However sad for him, the Nurse John from above entirely spoiled his game. I got a lot of feed about him right before the exams, and I marked him on my list as a competitor. Jason, because of my past experience with him, I knew his bloody game plan. Sitting next to Ashok and Anjan, I knew I had no choice, I had to step up my game or be eaten alive. I used to be a Kelly W, having no game plan but to win, win and win all the bloody immunities. I knew that once I lost my grip I would go, right then, right there. I slowly converted into a Neleh… I let myself be used as a pawn. I let the 2 believe that “Hey, this guy is falling into my trap” he’s no longer a threat! Even though my test marks were still maintained, they no longer looked there… They only looked at how distracted I was… All I can say is: Wrong Move! Stupid, Stupid People!!  I know I’ve still got a lot of work to do… For all I know, I’m the one being outplayed! Now that they’ve seen through my bloody plan, maybe I just need a new alliance, maybe I need to be the new and biggest FAIRPLAY!  P.S. For those interested, I got 4 A1s and 4 A2s, that makes a total of Distinctions!

      Ok, there's this friend in my OM team called Muthusamy. Since I have nothing to talk about today, I shall talk about him, and my Indian Physics teacher. As in Indian from India... I mean... You know what I mean...  Haha... Muthusamy is going to get the "Diane(Survivor 3) Award." Because that's exactly what he does, boss people around with his big fat mouth... Actually it isn't fat, but it's black. So anyway he is a guy that does all the slack jobs by opening his mouth to boss people around, and when people stand up to him, he cries. There was one particular time, when the rehearsals for OM were to be done in front of the Vice-Principal, and Diane here whined about having to go for a uniform group thingy. So naturally everyone protested and yadda, the case was brought to the teacher. In the midst of puberty tempers and very uncalled for tears, Diane revealed that what he wanted was rank and power in his uniform group. Oh my heck, how many people have an attendance like you... I mean I don't even go! We were lucky we protested and the case was brought to the teachers, because normally he would brush away protests like they were nothing, and just go on doing what he wants to do...  Actually it's pretty sad that I'm probably not going to do OM again, because I really loved the experience of staying in school till late, and all the bonding through ultimately fattening foods... Haha... Go OM!

      I have something called an Obsessive Compulsive Disorder when it comes to turning off the lights. My mother always gets pissed at my living in darkness, and she always says something about darkness making her depressed. As if she needs anything at all to make herself depressed... But anyway my thinking today revealed to me why I always had these vampire like instincts, living in the dark and at one point biting others.  You see I've always wanted to die, like in my previous post. Just get myself away from this horrid and cruel world. But then, after I pass from this world, where will I go? In the Bible, we will supposedly go to heaven, a place of joy. We will be there for the rest of time. Just imagine yourself feeling nothing but happiness forever. Knowing that this will never end. Looking at it like that Heaven may not be too desirable after all. And I won't even need to talk about hell.  Now for the vampire part. You see vampires will never leave this world. They just live and live and continue living on in this world. The only difference from heaven is that these vampires live in a changing world. A world with emotion other than joy. A world that is free for you to explore. A world that you know, and if you don't, will grow to know. Vampires live in a world where they are free to do whatever they want, without facing consequences. Of course there's the downside of having to take lives.  By belief, vampires are servants of Satan. If only I could be a vampire not under the control of Satan, not under the control of God. If only I could be the master of my life, my free and everlasting life...

      Ok... Singapore just broadcasted "World Idol" and I'm wondering why Asians could not vote. Racist people! Anyway only the first 6 people were shown, with the last 5 due next week. So here is my commentary for this week's show.  Ok when the German guy came out I was like "What were you thinking? With that sleeveless shirt?" He is quite a good-looking guy though, but his song choice is really bad. Up-tempo songs don't usually go well with the public's taste, and he will not have an audience large enough to win. For his limited English, I would actually say that was good enough, just not enough to win.  The Aussie Idol had a great voice, but his flamboyant style really puts me off. What's worse, he picked a well known song, changed the arrangement totally and destroyed the song. He was like talking melodiously, creepy. For the Pan Arabic Idol, who am I to judge? But anyway all I can say is that I thought her to be very brave but maybe her target audience is not huge enough to win World Idol. Right from one of the judge's mouths, funny he was reading my thoughts...  The Dutch Idol is another super geek turned superstar. And I really like his sense of humour, banking on his geekiness to give him the cool look. And this is emphasised greatly on the spectacles! He was quite good, but not outstanding, and like I said before not outstanding, means not winner. I'm still wondering however, how he got through the second auditions when he forgot his words. I don't think American Idol would have allowed him to.  A law student with a big face. Sy whatever you want but his voice is really good. His performance however really pitchy. I don't know if he uses English frequently, but anyway not good enough to win. But anyway I don't think anyone was paying attention to his pitch problems because of his good looks.   The Polish Idol... Ok, first things first, BRACES? Oh my god, Simon is never going to use the phrase "Too young for the competition" anymore. Well obviously she had a lot of pitch problems and an awkward sense of volume control, but like the German judge said, she has a big voice, and an even bigger personality. I love the personality and the dialogue between her and a few of the judges. I especially like the one where one of the judges said something about her being as bad as the Polish judge, and she had a look of pure horror on her face as she answered "No, not him!"   Hahaha... That's all for today, I'll bring you more next week!

      Yep, I was playing "The Sims: Superstar" yesterday, and I killed 2 people! Well I'm getting a little wierd, using the example of making a 70 year old couple give birth to 4 kids to tend to the farm! Well anyway I was getting jealous at the kids not having to go to school on alternate days, without having to see a doctor!  Well anyway I'm not staying in Boarding School for the next semester, and so my dad's going to get a timer fixed in my bloody computer. I hate that so much; what if I had a project that needed so much time to fix. I can see it now, that big red sign; "You have exceeded the time limit. Please call your father if you would like to request for extra time!" Oh my gosh, why can't these people just trust me? But anyway, on the bright side, my computer can be re-booted now!  Sorry for having nothing to write, but there's a difficult challenge on Survivor Fire that my tribe is currently trailing in. So I've gotta help...

      Yeah... It's the June holidays and I'm kind of taking a little time off from my beloved blog. But anyway if there's anyone reading, today will be all about the French Open final between two wonderful players; Coria and Gaudio!  Well with all the drama and theatrics, it was absolutely impossible for me to keep away from this topic. First was the loss of a set to love by a frozen Gaudio. I kept my hopes alive of Gaudio winning, but after it reached 5-1 in the second set I thought it would be all over. But a spark can be re-lit in the presence of oxygen, I thought, and remembered how he climbed up from a 5-1 in the second against Nalbandian. For a moment that seemed to be the case, as he went up 5-3, but then he lost the set.  My Dad was saying that Gaudio did not deserve to be there, did not even deserve the challenge. My dear daddy, I thought to myself, " In an unfair world it matters not that you deserve to be there, but that you are there!" The crowd was all behind Gaudio, and he climbed back up a set 6-4. Coria had strained a muscle, and was experiencing cramps. Huge drama it was when he was reduced to a snail's pace and lost a set!  In the final set both men were exhausted and Coria seemed to have recovered from his cramp. But anyway with crucial breaks at almost every turn, tension was high, the crowd was restless and the cheering could only be stopped by hitting a serve. All the rest was bullcrap tennis and really is not worth mentioning. Gaudio won in the end, after all his nervous laughter and his funny antics.  With all the drama and the theatrics, I believe that if I were on court that day I would win. Because I, for one, can act!

      Well looking at the amount of homework I've got for the June holidays, I really shouldn't be calling it the June holidays anymore. In fact, from now on I shall call it "Home School." Can you believe it? After the stupid SARS homework being posted on the internet, the school seems to have found more eco-friendly to have us print our own homework out. Like I said before, death iways a good option.  Anyway I really have nothing to write about. I'm basically posting for the sake of posting. So today, like I said a few posts before, I shall tell you about my friend Chun Ming. I've also said that I have no doubt my relationship with him is nothing but friendship, because I knew him before my hormones started raging.  First to his appearance. He has a really, really broad face, even broader than mine actually. He used to be really skinny and stalky, but now I've reached puberty and I've grown to be of equal height. And now he's sporting a bulging tummy that he doesn't want to bring up. Really, sometimes when you look at him he looks like a Chinese version of Barry Manilow and Clay Aiken crossed. Just that his face is growing just a little plumper. That too is something he doesn't want to bring up.  Now to his character. Obviously told by his growing body, he is a a rwally bubbly person, if you get my drift. His mouth can never stop complaining and talking. But unlike the 'Jenna Awardee' Samuel See, he spouts things that actually make sense. He is a creative thinker, like me and was involved in the OM competitions. He has a knick for shooting off his mouth sometimes, and the younger petty me got really angry with him once for letting off a secret of mine. But now he usually keeps his mouth in check. I have a wierd feeling that he'll make it well in the corporate world, but his stupid ambition is to be a teacher. His has however a whole list of ambitions; from owning a bus company to being the head of the Land Transport Authority. Any tourists to Singapore on a shoestring budget, go to him for help for public transport...

      Here is my supposed-to-be-unopiniated summary of the 4th leg of the race. I want to start off on a particular note, the note that basically says that Colin is a dirty, lowdown, son of a bitch. There, the start to my opinionless summary.  Ok so the teams got the clue at the pit stop, telling them to take a 20-hour bus ride to Buenos Aires, where they'll get their flights to Russia. Woohoo! New destination! Anyway, the teams arrived at the bus station one by one, and everything was closed. They agreed that they would get their tickets in the order to arrive, but when Colin & Christie talked to a ver sad man, they found here was a bus that left 3 hours later but still arrived at the same time. The queue rearranged, because of that scum of the earth. Mirna pissed off a few people, and drew an absolutely ucalled for "Don't talk to me" when she tried to ask Lance what was happening. The piece of shit went and bought tickets for 4 other teams, because "that's the order in which they were there." Hello colin... I didn't see any queue!??!         The four behind teams rushed to the airport, where Charla & Mirna standbyed on a Swiss Air flight. I really don't know if they knew about the flight to Germany at this point, cause they were playing push barbie around the airport and not bothering to find another flight. The twins & Bowling moms worked together while Bob & Joyce had no time to look. And everyone left... Oooh! Look who's the business loser this time. Bob & Joyce got business class seats! Haven't they learnt from 4 previous seasons? Anyway, everyone leaves and Charla & Mirna are left behind. They unexpectedly catch the Marshall & Lance flight. Like I said, I don't know if they knew already that there was this flight, but if they did, they're the airline experts for this season.  So, everyone arrives in Russia, and they find the stupid battleship. Fro the first time since the first leg, we see the Yield! The Detour: Block 5 shots, in which the teams travel to a nearby skating ring and have to block 5 ice hockey slap shots. And Drink 1 shot, in which the teams had to travel further away to do this traditional drinking thing. It's obvious to me that the drinking was much easier, and unfair also cause Charla's arms length would be too short. For some reason, there's no pictures with Charla looking absolutely hilarious in the ice skating outfit.         They had to find a bronze horseman in the middle of St. Petersburg, which is a waste of time route marker cause they didn't do anything there. They were then told that they had to go the the Old Tower for the most exciting Roadblock ever. Caviar, the most expensive salt there is on the market. The favourite topping for the high society table was wasted on one of the best thought Roadblocks I've ever seen. 1 friggin kilogram per person, which makes a total of 8 kilos. Now if 100 grams cost about 50 bucks, 1kg wouls cost 500, and 8 would cost the producers a whopping S$4000!         Anyway, the sodium chloride imbalance in most of the eaters mentally balanced Chip, who finished it in monster speed. The only other guy who ate, Marshall, could not match up, but was still miserably fast. Brandon and Colin are IDIOTS! The best eater was Charla, followed by Joyce. Nicole fell terribly sick, which shows she already has a little imbalance on the caviar side. Christie did not fall as sick, which means she's perfectly normal. Oh what a chemically incorrect task, but who cares anyway?  The teams all made thier way to Catherine's Palace, their pit stop. Yadda and Bob & Joyce were eliminated! Now, the producers are going to have to pay for the huge water bills that the caviar eaters were going to drink.

      Amazing Race's Sports Injury by  Ethan Alter    The Amazing Race's father-daughter duo, Jim and Marsha, got off to the roughest start of any team. After Jim took a tumble on the Santa Monica boardwalk and ripped up his knee, they were forced to go to the hospital, and nearly missed the first airline flight of the race. But they never gave up, battling their way into third place on the second leg. Their luck gave out Tuesday night though, as plane problems grounded them for good.     Ethan: So Jim, how's the leg?     Jim:  Oh, it's fine now. The stitches actually popped out five minutes after we were on the airplane. At that point, I was just concerned about infection, so I was taking antibiotics. Eventually, it went away and now I've got a nice souvenir scar.   Marsha:  He doesn't have feeling in the top of his kneecap though. He never mentions that part. But that's my dad, I guess.    Ethan: I'm still impressed that they were able to sew your wound up so quickly.     Jim:  That's actually a funny story. The nurse was taking her time, and I knew I had to get her on my side. She said, "I don't understand why you just can't take the next flight to Uruguay." So I said, "You don't understand, I have to get on that flight. I didn't want to tell you this, but I'm a producer and I'm filming a show in Uruguay. My camera crew is already on that plane. It's going to cost millions and millions of dollars if we have to delay the production." And she goes, "What kind of show are you making? Is it some sort of animal show?" I saw a spark in her eye and said, "Yes, it's an animal show." She said "Oh, really?" and then ran and got another doctor and a paramedic and all three of them did the procedure together. And then she said, "Okay, you go ahead and produce your show, but no running and no jumping."   Marsha:  She gave him a narcotic for pain and Dad threw it away because he didn't want to have a fuzzy head. All that injury and no pain medicine, I was so proud of him. We felt so victorious walking to the flight — I could hear the Rocky music in my head!       Ethan: Settle another issue: Did those bowling moms lie to you?     Marsha:  We still don't know. We overheard them talking to some locals, but they weren't discretely talking to them. It was like they were trying to lure other teams into listening, and I totally fell for it. After we got to the exchange booth and no one else was there, we figured they had tricked us. But then we wound up beating them to the pit stop and we thought that maybe we were just so wrapped up in the race that we misunderstood. We never confronted them about it and they probably had no hand in it. I can't wait to talk to them and say, "We're sorry for saying such nasty things about you!"    Ethan: What happened to you at the Buenos Aires airport? That was confusing.     Marsha:  I told the woman behind the counter to book us on the 9:10 flight, but there was only one seat left. So I had her book me on that flight and put Dad on the standby list. I also asked her to confirm us for the 10:30 flight. I think confusion arose because Brandon and Nicole — whom I never should have helped in the first place after they screwed us over on the first leg — asked us to buy their tickets, too. So now I'm asking for a lot of tickets, and I guess the lady got confused. In her mind, she said, "Well, Marsha's got a ticket for the 9:10, so I'll put Jim and Brandon and Nicole on the 10:30." So I think we're set and then Dad sees that I don't have a ticket for the 10:30 flight.   Jim:  She made the mistake of not giving us the tickets that we asked for and I made the mistake of not checking the tickets at the counter. Once we got back to the counter and realized she wasn't going to admit her mistake, we got the airport manager in on it and even she couldn't do anything. But we still didn't think we were sunk because we were first on the standby list for the 10:30 flight. So we get to the gate and they start calling out all the standby passengers, except us. We asked what was going on and the guy didn't even look at us. It was very apparent that we were not getting on that plane. He took Kami and Karli ahead of us, even though we were first on the list. I don't know how that happened. They may have done something behind the scenes that we didn't see.  Marsha: Or maybe he just thought blonds were cuter than brunets. [Laughs]    Ethan: You got on the 11:30 plane instead. Did you have any hope of catching up?     Marsha:  The episode didn't indicate this, but our plane was actually delayed for another 30 minutes. Once we landed, we ran a really quick race. If it wasn't for those 30 minutes, I think we could have caught up to Marshall and Lance. The producers even told us later that we were really close to beating those guys.

      Ok... That title is entirely random and hysterical. But anyway, this is my comments on each individual team on the third leg of the race, with teams showing their flight arrangement skills for the first time. The first leg isn't counted cause the flight arrangements were printewd on their Route infos...  Colin & Christie -- A first place finish was entirely unearned. They were featured much more this time than in the previous episodes, and we all saw that there's really nothing much to them. They're only first because of their ability, if you can even consider it an ability, to outrun Charla. There will come a point in the race where the team will face some immense difficulty, and this team will crumble because of Chrisie's inability to keep calm and be nice. Colin is a great racer, with his ability to keep calm and his classy aggressiveness in getting his plane tickets. Christie, on the other hand, will do nothing except to bring the team down.  Charla & Mirna -- Charla & Mirna showed that they had mental powress that could overcome a lot of physical obstacles again. They are paying for it, with Charla having limited choices to make in the physical tasks. I love it that they're so aggressive but can still work well together, but they need to be nicer to the other teams. I know they're policy is to be nice to those who are nice to them, but they do not need to flare up at those who aren't. If they didn't flare up today I think they'll be in a good position to go very far, but at this point, a Yeild might be the price to pay for being mean. Boo Mirna! Charla is having a hell lot of fun in the race, except the part where she turned into a chocolate loving frankenstein after getting electrocuted. It's sad that they made an alliance with people they cannot trust... They really need to use their Yeild power now, with most effect on Marshall & Lance.  Brandon & Nicole -- Nicole first; it wasn't a smart move revealing your bond with Charla & Mirna at the airport. I fully agree with Mirna on this one. One good thing is that she has revealed herself to not be the whiny one in this race, cause Christie is the one that has gone miles ahead of her in this area. Brandon seems to be the only one in this team, taking the reins in trying to find flights, doing the tasks cause he's stronger, and according to him has a bigger stomach for chocolate. I have to give the team their props on getting to the 2nd flight, cause I really didn't see them working. Maybe it was just dumb luck. It was really despicable of this team to go leave Charla & Mirna in the lurch like that, with possibly no flight out.   Bob & Joyce -- I'm actually starting to like this team, of course under a certain influence. They've been consistent in their 4th - 5th place finishes even with their lack of physicality. They weren't featured much in this episode, but I think they can use their age more to their advantage while getting flights. Too mild to fight off the aggressive teams at the moment, but sneak under the covers and be really, really nice, and you'll get pecedence over the others when it comes to this area. Maybe the world of internet dating isn't so bad after all...  Kami & Karli -- They got really lucky with the flights this week, but it might just die on them next week. Their characters are so similar that it is impossible to tell between the 2. Didn't notice much of them this leg, except for the fact that they keep bumping into Chip & Kim everywhere. Really showed their stupidity by missing the strip of shallow water leading to the island. Coupled with them walking right past the cluebox last week, I will safely quote my friend saying, "They use their legs more than their eyes." Big Question: Will they be back battling for last place with Chip & Kim? Definitely yes, and they'll hopefully be joined by Marshall & Lance.  Linda & Karen -- Karen's definitely the better racer in this team. She's giving way to Linda the big chicken by letting her do the easier, more enjoyable tasks. Linda will definitely bring the team down at some point, and Karen won't be able to do anything to stop it. Unless Karen has the angel-like temperament of Zach last season, she will also not be able to take the heat and will collapse with exhaustion at having to give way to her much weaker teammate.  Chip & Kim -- Back in third to last place, and Chip declares that they're moving up, slowly but surely. Surely you realise the elimination cut off point is moving up faster than you are. Chip didn't really show any of his idiotic qualities this week, but I'm sure it'll come out next week. Hopefully we get to see whichever one, the twins or them, get to the Yeild and try and kill one another. Chip is such and idiot but doesn't use his meaness meaningfully, like in getting his tickets.  Marshall & Lance -- Marshall & Lance was the team that really deserved to go this week. I said already that I wouldn't mind, and wouldn't be surprised if these 2 went. I'm going to say that again this week... I give them their props for getting the second flight out, but that "I'm dead" attitude at the roadblock probably would've made 10 white chocolates go down his throat without them noticing. The guy that wasn't doing to roadblock wasn't helping. Showing your frustration at you teammate is never a good idea. They are really boring, and ti sure looks like they get into trouble next week.  Jim & Marsha -- This pair definitely could've made it together. They're like the nice guy team this time aroung beside Bob & Joyce, and we would've loved to see them go further. As much as I don't want to, I have to bash them for their lack of skill in getting plane tickets. Really horrid that you managed to get tickets for someone else on the flight you weren't booked on. And in the whole race I've never, ever heard of only one team member being booked on a flight... Sad. They stayd positive till the end and there's a plus point for them.

      This to me was the best episode yet! With the dating couples ending their losing streak, and a proper, fun Roadblock and an even choice for Detour. The only sad thing was that the photo album is short of any good pictures. Boo the editors! Give me the photos, and I'll pick out the good ones for you...  Ok, so the teams left the pit stop in Buenos Aires. Brandon & Nicole got stuck in the mud, and Charla & Mirna, thinking they were friends, stopped to get them help. Charla , in the process, got electrocuted by an innocent looking fence. Poor her! The first betrayal: Charla & Mirna go on a different path. Brandon & Nicole, a few feet behind them, don't even bother honking to warn them...  At the airport, Brandon & Nicole found that all the counters were closed, and they decided to try to call for information. The earliest flight, at 9.10am, was full. The next flight, they thought, was at 10.30am. Everyone queued at the Argetina Airlines counter, but Marshall & Lance decided to go out and investigate. This I have to give them props for. Unless you have no time left, do not be satisfied with what you have. Charla & Mirna followed suit, and hearing that there was a 9.40 flight, ran to a ticketing counter just across the hall, lining before Marshall & Lance. Jim & Marsha helped Brandon & Nicole get tickets, which again violated Nicole's promise to help Charla & Mirna get tickets. In the end, Charla & Mirna, and a very lucky Colin & Christie, without Christie's help, got on to the 9.10 flight.         With that, the teams made their way to Bariloche, Argentina one by one, in 4 seperate flights. They were supposed to find the mayor of the place, but surprise, surprise, there's no picutre of him in the photo gallery. Anyway, from there, the clue directed them to a chocolate factory. Their task there was to chomp through 11000 chocolates to find 1 of 20 with a white centre. To me, and a few teams, this sounded like an easy, almost pleasurable task. However, people almost puked at the amount of chocolate they had to wolf down. I think it wouldn't have been a problem for Mr. Sweet tooth here, but I really haven't eaten that much at one go... So who knows? Charla proved that she was a little monster by zipping past Colin to receive a clue from her dwarf friend. How cute, or rather, coincidental.         Ok, so they head to a mountain thingy where they had to choose between "Rough Riding" or "Smooth Sailing". Nobody chose rough riding but it was a ride down a rough hill that is nothing scary, but slow. To me, the fear of falling down on a rough slope and feeling pain is much more than the fear of heights. Smooth sailing required the teams to go parasailing! Well, all the teams had fun!         After the parasailing was the pit stop. A little island connected to the main piece of land by a strip of shallow water... You know that kind of dreamy thing... Kami & Karli went temporarily blind and swam across insted of walking. But other than that, nothing happened. Aand Jim & Marsha were eliminated, if you were wondering...

      Amazing Race Exes Get Evil by  Ethan Alter  &nbsp; Alison and Donny It's often said that time heals all wounds. Apparently, that maxim doesn't hold true for Alison and Donny, the bickering couple who went from first to last during the second leg of The Amazing Race. In this exclusive Q&amp;A with TV Guide Online, the estranged pair of losers air their grievances and let loose with a few well-aimed barbs. This unpleasant exchange is about as real as reality TV gets, Race fans. Buckle your seatbelts!  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Alison, why did you decide to do another reality show so soon after Big Brother 4?    Alison:  I got an e-mail from CBS asking if Donny and I wanted to do The Amazing Race together. I asked him, and he said he wanted to do it. Of course, I wasn't going to be the one to hold him back from winning $1 million and I was also all about trying to win $1 million. So we mutually decided to do it.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Aside from the obvious, how did the two experiences differ?    Alison:  Well, here you had to work with teams, and that sucked for me. It was a lot easier to do things on my own and do things the way I wanted to do them. During the race, you have to be impulsive and quick and if you make the wrong decision — or if you let someone else make the wrong decision — then you're done.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Donny, why did you agree to sign on?   Donny:  Pretty much just for the opportunity to travel around the world on someone else's dollar. That's something you can never pass up. Neither of us had ever seen Amazing Race before, so we didn't know what we were getting ourselves into. And most of the people on the show have been fans for life. I'm sure a couple of teams had diagrams in their basement of everything that's happened on every single episode. We were almost going in there blindfolded.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   How did you prepare for the race?    Donny:  We were on the computer until four in the morning some nights doing straight-up research. You could tell from the first episode that we knew what we were doing, because we were the only people who actually asked which flight got there first. We did everything we possibly could to be prepared. We just tried to be overcautious at a certain point, and it didn't help much.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Did you have a strategy going in?    Alison:  We wanted me to be the brains and for him to be the physical aspect of the race. And in last night's episode, we kind of switched that a little bit. Donny decided to be mental as well, and that's kind of where we messed up.   Donny:  The race was way easier to do than dealing with her.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   Was it difficult to watch yourselves argue like that?    Donny:  Not at all. I knew exactly what to expect. There were no surprises.   Alison:  It was difficult for me. I didn't realize that all the name-calling would be coming from his end, and the things he said after the race. I didn't realize any of that would happen. That was a big shock for my friends and family, too. [He] was somebody I had trusted and confided in and for him to say such hurtful things killed me.   Donny:  Okay, well, don't let your tears get in the way, because you're no angel.   Alison:  Oh, I didn't cry, don't worry.  &nbsp;  Interviewer:   I guess this brings up the relationship question. Where do things stand now between the two of you?    Donny:  There's no relationship whatsoever. There's no speaking terms or anything. It ended the day the race was over.   Alison:  No, that's not true. I moved in with him and his family for a couple of months after the race — I don't know why you're deciding to lie. Things were actually fine after the race for a while. Then, I found out that Donny was not only verbally rude to me, he was cheating on me as well. So I decided to leave him.  Donny:  That's a good one, but no.   Interviewer:  Are you still living in the same city?   Donny:  We're not anywhere near each other.   Alison:  I moved like five states away, actually. Surprised, Donny? [Silence]   Alison:  He doesn't know.   Donny:  He doesn't care.  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Getting back to the race for a moment, what happened with the bus to the cattle ranch? That seemed to be the point where you really fell behind.    Donny:  We had no clue that there would be stops along the way. We thought, first-class bus, first-class seats, it would be direct the entire way. We also thought it was the only bus that went there. The other teams that got to the bus station after us found another bus that got there faster. At the point we got on the bus, we thought we were either first or last.   Alison:  I knew we were last.  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Knowing what you know now, what's one thing you would do differently if you ran the race over again?    Alison:  I definitely would not go on the show with Donny. It was sad because last night, all my ex-boyfriends were calling me, asking, "Why were you ever dating him?" and "Why did you go on the show with him instead of me?" That's the one thing I'd definitely change. I wouldn't have let him think. I wouldn't let him use his brains, if that's what you wanna call them.   Donny:  Well, your good looks got us nowhere, so don't worry about it.   Alison:  Hey, neither did yours.   Donny:  I would take the midget instead of her.  (Whoever the hell thought Alison was a bitch, look here!)  &nbsp;  Interviewer: Um, so... All in all, are you glad you did this?    Alison:  Yeah, I'm definitely glad.   Donny:  I'm glad I got to travel around the world with someone I hated.   Alison:  Maturity shines through...

      I'm still wondering why I have so much to blog about this week... So happening! Well, anyway, I will never let anyone copy outside of my presence again. Yes... If you haven't already inferred, someone got caught copying my work. &nbsp; The worst thing about it all was that the person that caught the copycat was the Maths Dean. Anyone in 3.16 would know that the maths dean can be one hell of a bitch. Oh yes... Did I mention that she was a close friend of my mother's? Well I was relieved when my maths teacher told me I was "almost" called up, which meant that I wasn't called up. But what happened was even worst. The Maths Dean made a personal call to my mom, telling her to "keep a closer eye on him." Oh... And you know what she told my mom? "He was involved in a copying case." Wow! That's specific enough... My mom actually thought I copied in my maths test, cause I was struggling with a question the day before. And I'll bet she'll get suspiscious should my results come out perfect. &nbsp; What a bitch... I really should get my maths teacher to clear this matter up. Call my mom then... Tell her that I'm getting my work copied instead of me copying... Now that will solve everything, cause she won't really care if I get As for everything while the rest of my class fails... HEHE!

      I just peeked into my sister's blog, actually delved into it. I really don't think she expected me to do so... I mean, why would I be interested? Well, I realised that evrything she tells us is what she tells her friends on her blog... So much for family... It really doesn't say much of the complexity of her mind, does it? She is as easy to read as a book... And me being a Literature student, I can read between the lines. &nbsp; Well, there's a comment on her blog about me having nothing to say. That's just because I've been alone all these years. You always with my other sister, and Mum always with Dad. I've never had a permanent companion. I kind of think mom sensed it... That's why till now I have a maid to "take care of me." It's kind of like Survivor isn't it? With two prominent alliances and me as the swing. &nbsp; I really can't believe my older sister thinks that I'm having problems at school. It's so stupid...&nbsp;Do my results show any problems? Somethimes people like to be left alone, so shut your overly huge trap and pinch your gigantic nose cause I am not having any problems at school! I really hate it that she keeps telling me about prayer and how it changes things. It seems so super artificial and hypocritical, especially with your kind of situation and most of all your detestable character. &nbsp; I cannot get why my sis is so transparent, when I'm so complex in character. Haha... I'm too complex for anyone to read me, not even my parents. Thinking about it I realise how I never miss her when she's gone... How I never miss anyone but my dad. Could it be that I'm the Kingshaw of this story? Ohh... That's sad... Maybe it's because the girls in the family have never been too highly intellectual, and I'm only able to mix with those people, and in the case of my family, only with my dad...

      Yes, the "programme" I was referring to is the CIP I had on Thursday at Macritchie Reserve. We had to walk 1 hour in and out of the area we were supposed to go to and it was all counted for our CIP hours. How nice is that? I calculated a total work time of 1.5 hours, and it is clocked at 6 hours. Not that I'm complaining, but wouldn't it be better if we walked into an office to do 6 hours of proper community work? Then again, the Physical Education &amp; Aesthetics department has never been known for their efficiency... It was really more fun than work, especially with the antics of the dynamic trio we know as our class teachers! &nbsp; Mrs Toh was dressed much more formally than she would in class, but maybe it's because she wears clothes that look like a house elf's rag to class. With her age catching up on her, you wouldn't be expecting her to bend down to pick up weeds would you? Very surprisingly, she was actually sppeding up the hill to go weeding. Maybe the biologically enhanced foods have something to do with it. When she actually started weeding, it looked like she was tending to her garden. Staying in one spot, it was as if she was looking after her plot of flowers. When we were done, she beamed at us and told us the huge pile in the middle of the path was her's. Halfway done the hill, she actually started running, as in really running. " To the aircon!" she yelled as our incredulous faces looked up at her. &nbsp; Mr Sham kind of thought he was Tarazan... He was looking for all the vines hanging on trees and tried to swing on them. He really showed a wild side of himself when he joined in the tug-of-war with the tree. Actually, I thought he lowered himself to my class' level of intelligence, which is not at all very high. But I tell you something... He actually has a car! I mean, it was pretty shocking to see a Malay teacher have a car, but his car wasn't even the typical Malay second hand car, it was a nice, middle-class car. Well... Call me racist, but Malays are never known to be rich are they? &nbsp; Deven was the most embarassing thing ever. He was trying overly hard to be funny, incorporating his little bit of Physics into a weed pulling activity. He was being blatantly ridiculed by Ashok and Anjan, but I have a feeling he really didn't know it. When I told him in his accent to "apply the force" on the weed, he threatened to "apply the force on your face!" I guess I don;t look Indian enough... Or maybe my imitation was too good. After we went back to home ground to retrieve our bags, Ashok caught a caterpillar meant to scare Mr Sham. Mr Sham managed to a certain extent hide his fear, but when Deven saw it he was totally mortified. He was saved by the ranger asking Ashok to put it back, and later gave the lame excuse of it having the possibility of being poisonous.

      Yeah... I was forced to buy tickets for the Festival of Arts. If I had to spend my time and money on something, it would definitely be Drama. Even though I knew that the storyline had no backbone, it was still better than going into a sleeping room with the music teams. So yes... My very professional comments on the performance:  &nbsp;  Storyline -- The storyline is a failure. Anybody and everybody could see that. But this was meant mostly for inter-school fun, so the storyline doesn't exactly matter. The author of the script is definitely not a thinker.  &nbsp;  Script(dialogue) -- Amidst a sea of puns and witty comments, the script wasn't exactly too smooth flowing. It was really good enough for a school performance like that, just that it wasn't perfect. The witty asides are what's best in the script, and this is where most of the Drama Club sriptwriting skills shine. For the simple and nonsensical storyline, the script was almost too good.  &nbsp;  Characters -- The characters in the script are absolutely perfect. Each one represents the typical, overboard NS men often talked about. The Nerd, the Macho, the "on" one, the totally queer one, the "good future" one, and the "cannot live without home" one. Sadly, the very interesting subject of Malay logic was not touched on.&nbsp; Malays are one of the main components of army life, without whom the&nbsp;NS experience is not complete. With a repetition of the "nerd" and the "good future", I really don't see why they couldn't do a dim-witted Malay. Super extreme cliches work well with the nonsensical storyline,&nbsp;but incomplete experience just makes the cast a little less than perfect. &nbsp;  Entertainment value -- Why do people watch comedies? To let loose, and have fun. With the flimsy storyline, the entertainment value had better be up there above perfection. Yes... Very much laughable, but definitely not high-level humour. After a while, the humour became very much corny and overused. I still do like the parts where the actors break into absolutely ridiculous and out of point dances. Their ability to incorporate a little musical influence really impressed me. It was the most highly intellectual humour in the whole script. &nbsp; Overall rating: Good, but not rememberable. 3/5!&nbsp;

      Ok... Here's the comments on the teams that I bring every reality show I watch. That is if we here at Singapore aren't too behind... I titled the post perky underdogs cause the underdogs seem to really be having fun on the race! Go the underdogs! Here's the whatever I promised stuff...  Brandon & Nicole -- I said last week that much was expected of this team, but they underperformed last leg. This leg, however, was a totally different story. They showed no negative signs, no whining, and no complaining. Nicole, however, may be a little too inactive for my liking. Poor her getting shagged in a foreign country, and all her boyfriend did was look for his balls(pun!). Bad Boy... They got a little lucky with the cemeterys, having their taxi driver correct them...  Charla & Mirna -- GOGOGOGO the little one! I love you Charla! She absolutely rocked the episode with her punk dancing, her ballerina twirling and her "stick your hand up the cow's behind" comment. It wasn't exactly fair that they got on the common ferry, but who cares right? It does make up for her inability to run, and she paid for it again at the foot race to the pit-stop. All I'm afraid of is that Mirna will feel like she's doing everything for the team, which is so untrue. I think Charla helped more with the slab of beef in the first leg. Nicole & Brandon are getting along well with them, so maybe, hopefully, the mentioned alliance next week is them. Then Brandon can carry Charla during a foot race! Ahh... I sense the first working Amazing Race alliance even before I see it! And did you see Mirna's face when she hugged Phil? Hilarious!  Jim & Marsha -- Wowzer! This team shocked me with their 3rd place finish. Who would expect the weakest team last leg to come out so strong this leg. Victims of the bowling moms? LOSERS! Ok... it was really bad of the moms to play so dirty, but who would believe that a middle class country like Argentina doesn't accept US currency? Even we in Singapore accept US currency! I really like it, however, that they finished in front of those moms. Rub it in their faces people!  Linda & Karen -- Who would expect the moms to be such home-bred bitches? Firstly, they've not heard of a foam party... Superbly stupid... And then they, like those bloody cowards in class, bully those weaker than them. How low can you go? I really, honestly, hope that these 2 go down next week. Who knows? we may get to see Charla jumping on her trampoline tummy... Btw, I thought the "You outsmarted a cow" comment was serious on their part. And I still don't know which is Linda and which is Karen...  Marshall & Lance -- Who? What? Where? After a fluke showing on the first leg of the race, this team proved that they teams cannot be judged on just 1 leg of the race. They are so insignificant because they are humourless and entirely serious. Who was it claiming to be the Ken & Gerard of the race again? This team needs to go soon... They are of no interest to us viewers.  Bob & Joyce -- Really, really horrible leg for these 2, and they still managed to stay in. First, the wrong cemetery... A little luck was involved of course, but they could have simply told the driver Evita Peron and he would've known where to go. No... I have to speak in their native style... Chacarita! Chacarita your way home soon people! Oops... Sorry if I just cursed you... Anyway, really bad call with the detour. Just because you like dogs doesn't mean the dogs are easier. Matching the face is much easier than walking one mile!  Colin & Christie -- Same comments as last week. This team definitely has chemistry together, and a lot is expected of them. However, they have failed to show us any of their outstanding abilities. I really wouldn't be surprised seeing these 2 eliminated the next time. I wouldn't be too upset either! They're getting monotonous and are sinking into the depths of Marshall & Lance's oblivion. If they don't show well the next time, I will have absolutely nothing left to say...  Chip & Kim -- Chip's a bastard. Need I say more? Yes I do! They sank as low as the bowling moms this time, playing it absolutely dirty. I have to say though, the stand off in the cab was a very smart tactical move, and it was absolute fairplay, even though some might not admit it. I'm sure that everyone rather him be nicer and let the bloody taxi go. Well these 2 have got to take a taxi and go home soon, cause I have a feeling next episode Chip will show more of his torrid qualities that I will surely hate.  Kami & Karli -- Poor little babes got stood up by that bloody Chip. Really respectable that they managed to finish the dog walking task even though they hated dogs. Maybe it's because they're so catty... There seems to be a significant twist in the detours this season; one is much easier than the other. They're enemity with Chip & Kim will push them to use the "Yield" next episode... I hope! These 2 teams will continue to battle for the last team in, I can feel it.  Alison & Donny -- What a bummer. Donny's a strong guy, but maybe he's too dimwitted. Alison's a weak girl, but she's smart. These 2 make a really dynamic duo, but queerly they were booted so early. Alison confirmed she's a bitch by walking away so defiantly from her partner after getting eliminated.

      Ok... Here's my blow by blow summary of what happened on the second leg of the race. This week's picture album totally sucked, with no pictures of the tango detour. Very queerly, 50% of the pictures were of the foam party at te 'Shake' place,when on TV they only spent 5 mins there. The poster of the photographs was also crazy, cause Kami & Karli have so many pics when Bob & Joyce have none...  Ok, so you know they were in Uruguay when they stopped. They received the clue to go to the pub 'Shake' in the Uraguaian downtown. The little lady went the wrong way, which I was absolutely pissed at cause Brandon & Nicole were right there for them to follow. The bowling moms surprised me with their navigation skills as they took over Alison & Donny to reach the pub first. Meanwhile, Charla & Mirna chanced upon a hooker!  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to Charla about the hooker): She's pissed now cause we're talking to her when she's got business to do.         And so the teams reached the pub one by one. Brandon & Nicole were the ones victimised by the task, with Nicole getting squeezed in the context of trying to burst her beach ball. Ok... That sounds sick! Ok, yeah! She gets touched and shagged, and for a moment I thought the guy was going to rape her under the foam while Brandon minded his business with the balls. That sounds sick again! Ok... The creepy face in the picture is probably the molester...         From the part house they were supposed to go to the port to take a ferry to Buenos Aires, Argentina. Charla & Mirna missed the ferry. I mean if Charla was normal they'd have missed it. Again... MANIPULATION! The little lady actually used her disability to her advantage again. I have a feelin this is going to be the trend for as long as they are here. She is one power pack... Getting the ferry to wait for the "Guest of Honour". Go the little one!  They got to Argentina and had to go to Evita's resting place. It was a cemetery called Recoleta, but a few teams got the wrong cemetery, going to Chacarita, where Evita's Husband, the president, was buried. It is absolutely disrespectful of the producers to make the teams run into the cemetery like that. Oh, and Charla & Mirna caught a buggy which decided it would help a 'little lady'.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Mirna to buggy driver): Little lady here! Little lady here!  And the teams received a clue for the Detour. Yay! In tango, teams had to travel 1.5 miles on any preferred mode of transport to El Tango, where they would receive a picture of one of the dancers. Then, they would have to enter in a horribly lit, beautiful and atmospheric theatre, where a large number of people were doint the tango. Recognise the face. Very difficult in the dim light, but still easier than walking 8 unruly hounds 1 mile. That was of course in Perro! Teams had to deal with hyper active dogs that sometimes were overly horny for their own good. Only Kami & Karli and Bob & Joyce completed this task.  Amazing Quote at this point(says Alison to the dog): You can't keep having sex!         From there, the teams went to a cow farm. What's it with cows this time? First, slaughtered, bloody cows. Then now its alive and fast cows... Oh the irony! Anyway the roadblock clue read: "The person that's doing this task must have fast hands and fast feet".   Amazing Quote at this point(says Charla to Mirna): You may have to stick your hand up the cow's ass.  And anyway, the teams did not have to do that. all they had to do was get a bananda off the cow's neck. Luckily Charla didn't step up to stick her hand up the cow's ass cause she would have been trampled to death.         All the blah and teams had to go on a horse carraige to their next pit stop.        Oh yes... Did I mention that Alison and Donny were eliminated? What a shocker. I really don't know what to say after 2 most expected couples got eliminated first... *hums away*         Opinions and views on teams will be posted later tomorrow I kind of tired now... And there's school tomorrow. *Sighs*

      Yes... I'm pissed again! That Jenna I was telling you about is rally becoming the most irritating and impetuous bastard I have ever seen. Samuel See Boyao, a mention of that very name and I feel like puking my existence out of myself. He is a friggin deperate asshole who laughs like a bloody Hyena. He is such a desperate wuss that he needed a loser last year to introduce him to a loser girl. One look at his screwed up face and you'll know why he's so bloody desperate. Stupid, low class and unhumouring idiocracy is what I will describe his life as...  Well, he's really not as bad as the bitch of the class I will term as the 'Deena Awardee'. Being a secretary of the class he seems to hold more power than anybody else in the class. For some reason he doesn't dare face the class, has absolutely no confidence and charisma, but in front of the teachers... Ooh, that's a totally different story! "Oh Mr Deven, so and so didn't do duty yesterday..." "Oh Mrs Toh, can you ask them to donate $2 to the class fund?" Wanna be responsible boy? Start doing your own Maths homework and handing it up on time first! Hypocrites are those I hate the most...  Oh yes... Have I added that he's a bloody faggot? He flirts with that German student in the class only because he has influence over teachers. Definitely a good person for his re-nomination bid next year. Well kid, if it is a re-election bid, say bye bye to your power, and guess who moves in to your place? Haha... ME! No one supports your "It's against the school rules..." (in a whiny voice) stand. No one ever listens to the feeble and suddenly without a teacher unauthoratative "No balls allowed..."Who is the one who is gaining respect from everyone; the social groups, the uncool people, the smart gang and even the ruggers? ME! You think you got itsy bitsy control over your puny German ally? I kind of think he would want me to be in your place FAGGOT!

      Here are the actual highlights of this leg, not my opinion!  The first thing the teams did when thet arrived in Uruguay was to find this hand on a beach. Supposedly it is the "Last thing you see of a drowning person." I really like it. Who'd think that you have an art form besides thosed stupid sandcastles on a beach.         From the big hand the teams went into the tree area where they hunted for ferry tickets. They took a ferry to an islan and went to a meat farm to recieve their next clue. At the meat farm, they found out that they had to carry a huge slab of beef to a meat shop. It was a very uncreative challenge, and my favourite team, Charla & Mirna, lost their lead because of the sheer physicality of it. I feel that for a team to gain a lead using their wits, and then to lose it because of their disability, is super unfair. Boo the producers!         Then came the Detour: Chips or Zips. Chips involve the team going into a casino to play a game of roulette. The teams start off with 20 chips, of which they can only use 5 at a time. They must match the number of the landing to get their next clue. My call, 4 attempts of 5 chips each will take you less than 10 minutes. Just bloody well try your luck! For some reason, there are no pics of them playing chips. Zips involve teams having to cross buildings on a zipline, then descend almost 20 storeys into the pool on another. That will take them about 20-30 mins at my guess. Might as well chips first, then try the zips!         Here's the pit stop photo which they didn't have in their photo album, It's different from the other photos, cause it's in a different section of the site...        That's all with their limited photo album. But Dennis & Erika, my initial favourite team, got eliminated! Sucks...

      Amazing Race? Definitely! I don't see why CBS hesitated so much about bringing this season back, cause from the first episode, I can totally tell this season's going to be absolutely awesome! My comments on the teams... Well sorry they're up so bloody late, my sis's been hogging the com!  Alison & Donny -- Everybody hates me, nobody likes me! I thought that Alison would come in with that mentality, but no, only her little Donny is upset with her, or so she thinks. Overall this is a strong team, even though I hate to admit it! I really don't see any place where Alison can lie and cheat in this game. Flirting, is a whole new story. Maybe, since flirting can only be done at the pit-stops off camera, she can slvage her deviled reputation.  Marshall & Lance -- Who the hell? How the hell? When they reached the pit-stop, I was like, "How did they get there?" They played an extremely insignificant role in this episode. It's either they are simply a boring team, or CBS is trying to keep them low cause they win the race. If another alpha-male team wins this time, I'm not going to be too happy, especially if it's this boring pair that thinks they're the Jon & Al and Ken & Gerard of this season. They might as well say they're the Rob & Brennan and Chris & Alex, since they're the only alpha males!  Karen & Linda -- Surprise, surprise! The bowling moms can actually do something. Do you actually belive that bowling is a sport mommies? The answer to that question lies in your physical condition. They only got eliminated by a smart but to a certain extent unfair twist in the flights. I mean they probably didn't even know that the second flight arrived earlier. I really liked it that they worked together in carrying that slab of beef. They weren't even tired after they completed the task. That's about the only thing rememberable that they did in this leg...  Bob & Joyce -- Our quiet couple of this race. They are very mild and nice people. Their lack in physicality, I believe, will bring them down in this race. They migh fluke like Teri & Ian, but I really don't think so. Letting the man do everything, my dear Joyce, is not right. You sould've help carry his backpack while he carried the beef. They remind me of an old couple in my church. The man had a stroke...  Charla & Mirna -- What can I say? GO GO GO THE LITTLE ONE!!!!! She said that she was here to break all stereotypes about dwarves, but to me she just displayed the exact thing I expected! I mean, after Gimli's performance in Lord of the Rings, I kind of think everyone's stereotype of a dwarf is: stubborn, strong headed and determined. She really impressed me with her firepower, zipping around everywhere like she was a cat on a race. Well she is on a race... Mirna's having the hots for Phil, that's going to be real funny! Too bad that we don't get to see the 12-hour intervals.  Brandon & Nicole -- Shame on you 2. Admidst high expectations, these 2 surely did not perform. They got on the second flight, and the twist in the flights surely saved them. Everyone, including myself, thinks they look like a carbon copy of Flo & Zach. They have in fact, displayed traits of being Flo & Zach. Nicole started whining in this episode, and it looks like she may be on her way to a number one spot that Flo has taken. Brandon, has not displayed Zach's wits, and basically that will bring this team down. Both models are heading for disaster with their most probable brainlesness (think Derek & Drew), but I'm looking forward to seeing whether they can beat Millie & Chuck in their christian proclaimations. Prediction, 4-5 place (think Derek & Drew and Millie & Chuck).  Colin & Christie -- The predicted power couples are surely not performing here, with Brandon & Nicole already down, these 2 went even "downer." They had the flight twist to blame, unlike the previous pair. I mean, who would expect such a smart, but evil twist? I really love their charisma and chemistry together. I do think they'll go far in this race.  Chip & Kim -- I do not like this team. There you have it straight in the face! Call me racist, call me anything you want, I DO NOT like this team. Firstly, they do not have the charisma and chemistry that the other couples have. Secondly, they made an absolutely stupid mistake. How can there be a task without the information? Booyah! I absolutely did not think they would make it to the pit stop so quickly. But I really pitied them. Phil should've just imposed a time penalty and got them over with it.  Kami & Karli -- They say the word 'manipulating' in a creepy, blonde way! All I want to say is mostly the same as Chip & Kim. Move away girls, Charla and Mirna are the smart ones that are going to manipulate Charla's glaring disability. The question is, do these bimbos do better than the himbos of last season? Probably not!  Jim & Marsha -- I would love to see Jim interact with Marshall. Imagine this, "Hi! I'm Marshall..." with Jim replying, "Really, I was only a captain!" Haha, sorry I'm being so lame. I kind of think he named his daughter afer the word Marshall... How stupid! Tearing your leg in the first few seconds just means this team is entirely incapable. Being the first Father/Daughter team, they are a huge dissappointment.  Dennis & Erika -- This team had the chemistry, the character and the charisma. It was really sad to see that they didn't have enough aggressiveness to be in the race. It was a sad, sad first bootee. It never pays to be nice in every reality show. I really thought Jim & Marsha deserved the boot more than these 2 did, but adious anyway!

This was actually my favourite team to win. Sadly, they are eliminted cause of Dennis' nice guy attitude. Erika is so bloody stupid to lose herself a guy like this!

The two were born only a month apart in Syria and emigrated to the United States when they were young children. Between the two of them, they speak a variety of languages, including Armenian, Turkish, French and Spanish, and have traveled extensively to foreign countries -- skills that should prove valuable during the competition.   This is my favourite team based on purely character. I think they have the brains to make it far, but their physical disadvantage will definitely bring them down. Luck, luck, luck! Go the little one! By the way... Doesn't she look pretty fast for her short legs? I mean, she was whizzing through everywhere! Again... Go the little one!

Throughout the show viewers endured Alison's incessant whining regarding whether her relationship with 21-year-old boyfriend Donny would still be intact after he'd seen her Big Brother behavior. Obviously the answer was yes.  Now we have to bear through another season watching Alison cheat, lie, flirt, and backstab -- only this time while she travels (at least partway) around the world. Thanks CBS.

      Yes, yes... By the time you read this I expect you to know the Greeks won Euro 2004. It's legendary isn't it? The Greeks let in the Trojan horse and boom, the Trojans get themselves smashed. Well in a way this is a literary dream come true, I mean, the bloody underdogs played a great move and they deserved to win.  The legendary Trojans went on defence, closing the walls and even getting the attackers to come in and defend (think Ronaldo). The Greeks knew they had to pull something off to win it, they had to risk it... As in in the legendary story the horse was suspected, and if they went ahead and burnt up the horse Greek's hopes were all gone. But the Greeks went for the risk, and they pulled off the Trojan horse trick. This is bloody scary... I mean all the similarities...  Oh well, not really my usual length of posts... But it'll do for now! Go Greece, boo the overconfident, overhyped ad overrated Portugal.

      Haha! Today was my group's Youth Day presentation, and I tell you... It sucked! Why? Because it was so incredibly boring, and it didn't induce any strong emotion from the audience. That, is what you call a horribly horrid performance!  And I tell you, their downfall was using the most amateur instrument of modern day poetry, rhyme! Lousy, lousy, lousy, and they all thought it was marvellous... It is such a straightforward recitation of our thoughts that even my mom conceded it was bloody boring. Why, why, why? Why didn't they just accept that laughter is always the best way to get through. Why did they not accept my script? Because they wanted it serious.   I tell you that if you're being judged by a panel that supposed to be open to all forms of presentation, that thing would have been so fine, but hello, in front of a larger audience, the one sure thing that will win all of them is their participation. What can induce them to participate? Clapping! What can make them clap? LAUGHTER! Next time something like this happens... Fuck it off, cause they're not going to listen to the truth anyway. This team is so fucked up. Make Michael god then...

      Recently blogging has been all the trend, and on the papers it's been pretty publicised. Some blogs have been singled out as good and popular; some of which actually mean something, some of which don't. Today I was unfortunate enough to chance upon one that was a diary of a tormented and life of pure idiocrasy.  If you are bored and want to take a look into the blog, here's the address(http://xiaxue.blogspot.com). I don't know what so special about her blog, cause all I see is daily routine and well, Singapore propaganda. Oh yeah... There's it's own bit of vulgarity as well. At least here I'm refined enough to learn how to control my anger when there's nothing but a blank screen staring at me. How can any proper lady get so crude without any provoking factor? Maybe, in her definition, a "Singapore Lady."  Here it's entirely different isn't it? I hate Singapore, I bash Singapore, only because unlike her, I am a highly intelligent person who has prospects outside of Singapore. What's even worse is that she actually generalised people "Coming from English-speaking girl and boy schools like ACS or MGS" as those who traditionally quit the country for better opportunities. I don't know what's her bloody problem, probably that she was never smart enough to get into these English speaking schools. She obviously can't see that people in these, by the way top schools, have enough foresight to recognise that honest and long-term success cannot be obtained by those who stay illogically loyal to their country.  From my point of view, even my dog makes more sense than her. I'm just hoping that this extreme will, like her blog, attract the masses, the intellectual masses...

      Drat it... I've been having problems with blogspot these few days, that's why my Amazing Race stuff is up so late. I couldn't log in properly, so I emailed the admin to find out whta's wrong. I don't know whether they did help me fix the problem, but anyway it's fixed now so I'm fine with it. Anyway I realised I'm not posting much about my regular life anymore, so since I'm free and not sleepy, I'll do that right now!  First let's start off with the tests. Quite a few tests back over the recent weeks, and I topped all of them! With a Bio and E Maths perfect, I'm invincible at the moment. At least since this week, that is... I had a E Maths test on Monday on a topic I haven't done with my tutor, and I know that I did really horribly. Then yesterday came the big blow, my English test came back and I crapped. I actually failed an English test. At one point in time I remembered being regarded as an English expert. And I failed my test, 21/50. Entirely depressing! I guess it put me in place, so now I've got to work even harder... I'm really starting to wonder how long more I can keep this up. I have a feeling I'm going to break soon.  Anyway for Biology that idiotic b!tch Kelvin Chen got 24/25. He's really scary, cause now he's pumped to try and knock me off my top spot. I hoped he got really discouraged by my beating him when I didn't even study the night before. I'm wondering how I can convey that to him. "You're stupid... I didn't even need to study to get this one, and you worked so hard for a less than perfect score." Any suggestions on how that message can get to him?  I went out with Mum and Dad today, and if I remember correctly I ate Shanghainese. My memory is horrible these days, need to think before I can remember what I ate a few hours ago. On the way there there was this old Caucasian man pushing his wife out of Gleneagles hospital. His wife seemed to be real sick and only had her ward robes on, and her flesh was poring out of it. I didn't mean to say she's fat, I just wanted to show how weak and helpless she looked. Anyway they seemed to be rushing to Tanglin Mall. I really don't know what was happening, but I kind of think she was pretty much ready to go, and her husband was granting her her last wish or something. It's scary to think that you might be in this position a couple of years down the road. That's probably one of the reasons why I don't want to get married. C.S Lewis once said, "To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, and your heart will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken." I never want to fall in love.

      Yes, I told you that all the animal titles would be my comments on the teams. The sphinx can be counted as an animal right? Even though it has a human head. Argh.. Nevermind! Let’s get to it shall we?  Colin & Christie – With a display of great wit this leg, they have gained a 13 hour lead over the other teams. They, however, seem to lose it next leg as Charla & Mirna steal their cab. They really deserve for their cab to be stolen, after all that bickering this leg. Going to travel agencies seems to be what Colin does best, but always remember, when there’s a flight that’s going to go soon, and you cannot afford to waste time, it’s not always the best option. Colin has a really bad attitude, and instead of Christie bringing down the team, Colin will succumb easily under pressure. I thik they have what it takes to go far, most probably to the final 3 teams.  Charla & Mirna – I can’t make any excuses for their neglecting to check with the trusty travel agencies. Like I said before, the safer option is the airport. Their not being able to find a taxi was stupid, even though they did save a bit of cash there. Finding the 50 min earlier flight out was one of the best tactical maneuvers I’ve seen on this season so far. I kind of think if Colin & Christie had gotten the same tickets as everybody, they wouldn’t have performed as well as these 2, because they would’ve succumbed to “peer pressure” and went with the others to eat, drink and be merry. Mirna better start doing something for the team, cause now it isn’t exactly balanced. With 2 people o the team with an equal number of plus and minus points, balance is very important.  Brandon & Nicole – Funny how the expected Final 3 teams come in 1,2 and 3 this leg. Of all the spoiled final 3 teams, I think this one is the worst as they succumbed to “peer pressure” to fellowship with the other teams instead of trying to find better options. Getting Chip to help, was it a show of manipulative powers? I don’t know. Not much shown on this leg about them really…  Chip & Kim – Where was Kim? I don’t even recall her speaking in a confessional this time around. Chip seems to be the brains and brawn of this team, and Kim is just there to fulfill the ‘team’ requirement to get into the race. I kind of think that they need to start bickering a little bit to make more of an impact on the show. Chip surely went up in my ratings this week. Although helping people is not so much a good tactical maneuver, I’ve said it before that I’d rather someone play Mr. Nice Guy than good player. He better not help anyone if they get any further, cause he may just ‘help’ himself out of the race.  Marshall & Lance – All I remember of them was that Marshall’s leg was hurt. I don’t see how he got that injury, unless he was so dumb that he injured himself during the 12 hour break. Oh yeah… He is dumb! I really don’t know why they didn’t ask help from anyone for the Rock & Roll thing, since one of them was injured. They actually showed a little race skill by checking in with the Air France office. Unfortunately, it was closed. When a team is rumored to be eliminated next round, I don’t think it’s exactly viable to support them.  Kami & Karli – They really don’t seem to have any brains. You know that you’re more physical than the bowling moms, and when you don’t know where to go you might as well wait for them and then beat them at the Roadblock. It was risky for them to go walking around like that, without a clue as to where to go. If they weren’t helped out by Chip, I think they would be roaming the desert for 40 years.   Linda & Karen – Domestic airport mistake, again! These people never learn, do they? I’m just wondering how they’ll cope next week, because this week was all that was shown of them was mistake after accident, and mistake after accident. Again, the blonde one didn’t do anything, and what’s worse, now she has an excuse to let the other one do all the work. I was hoping they didn’t catch up to the 3.15pm flight to Cairo, because they really didn’t deserve to. Getting their money stripped of them was entirely deserving, but what would’ve been better is that they got eliminated.

      Anyone see dead mummies this episode. I sure did, but of course since the producers were not licensed to kill they had to almost kill them by stripping them of all their cash in Egypt. I mean, when you’re not going to be going to the airport, and you’re in a poor country like this, how in the world are you going to get money other than being a night soil carrier?  So, the teams left the pit stop in Catherine’s Palace, and found that they had to take a train to St. Petersburg’s Hermitage museum. There they had to find Rembrandt’s “Return of the Prodigal Son”, something that sounds vaguely familiar. I kind of think I chanced upon it while doing my OM research, because Rembrandt is one of the registered artists in the problem. So anyway Chip & Kim took an extraordinarily long time to find the painting, while Colin & Christie started a leg of bickering by suggesting that the Prodigal Son was Jesus. I’m left wondering whether God neglected to give him any sense of general knowledge. In the meantime, Charla & Mirna, unlike all other teams who took cabs, “choo-chooed” their way to the train station on foot. A great display of Race skills was shown when she asked locals about the painting.         Once the teams found their painting, they found that they had to go to Cairo, Egypt, for this leg of the race. Chip & Kim stupidly rushed to the airport, while Colin & Christie, a pair that has proven to be apt at flight arrangements, walked to a travel agency. A travel agency is the place where they actually check all the airlines for the earliest flight. In airports, their access to flight information is limited, and most of the staff are too lazy to check thoroughly.  Kami & Karli were the only other team smart enough to go to a travel agency, but they were too late to catch Colin & Christie’s flight.  Colin & Christie came to the realization that they were on the earliest flight to Egypt, and the others had been duped by the Lufthansa lady. They had a stopover in Paris, for quite a number of hours, I presume, since they had time to find another flight. This flight, instead of 2.25pm, landed at 2.35 am, about 12 hours earlier than expected. They got to Egypt and the Tower of Cairo, but found it closed. The poor things had to sleep in the Egyptian streets. I mean, even the poor Egyptians don’t sleep on the streets, and they had to?!  All the other teams stopped over at Frankfurt, except Linda & Karen. They were found to be with the lying Lufthansa lady, who informed them it was possible to catch up in Frankfurt. She turned out not to be lying for a second time around, cause they really caught up. Meanwhile, in Frankfurt, cousins Charla & Mirna proved that they were too small to be noticed when they isolated themselves from the other teams to find better tickets out. It turns out that there was a better flight, and our little pink panthers, complete with the tiptoeing scene, left for the flight that landed 50 minutes earlier than the other. That scene, coupled with Lance stirring in his piggy-wiggy slumber, was one of the most hilarious scenes in TAR history.  In Cairo, Colin & Christie went up to the tower to find one of 2 “Fast Forwards” in the whole race. In a way it was a good option because there are only 2, and the likelihood of you using either would be pretty small. Might as well take a rest from 1 leg of the race. They had to carry this sarcophagus, one of those gold coffin thingys in the pyramids that you usually see in the movies, from somewhere to a temple. Colin was being a huge jerk by thinking he was so smart and not heeding Christie’s advice. In the end, Christie was right and they carried the thing to the temple. At the temple, Christie refused to shut her gap and wanted Colin to admit he was wrong. Bad move! I should know since my father’s a Colin (same name, same character…). When they reached the temple, Colin halted and started bickering. The priest started shaking his head in disapproval… Hey! These clue holders aren’t supposed to display emotion! Well anyway, I was hoping the priest tear up the clue in objection to their quarrelling in his temple, but he didn’t and sent Colin & Christie along to their pit stop, The Sphinx.         Colin & Christie arrived at the pit stop at 11.27am, and I have to fast forward 3 hours to when Charla & Mirna arrive. They go to the Tower of Cairo, and found that they had to go to the Giza plateau and follow the yellow rocks to their next clue. They went there, had a little trouble, and then finally got themselves to the Roadblock. From what I see, this was the most time consuming thing in this leg. It might have taken even longer than the Detour!         The Roadblock: one team member had to enter Osiris’ shaft and grab a artifact bag. Citing claustrophobia, Mirna asked Charla to go down. I’m left wondering what Mirna can do besides getting her team noticed at ticketing counters. Poor little Charla had to climb every single rung of the ladder because of her “littleness”, and after a while, with the bag as big as she was, she had to take little rests on the ladders. Those producers sure aren’t thinking too much about her still being in the race…         Anyway, Charla & Mirna were given a map as their next clue, coupled with the contents in the bag. Puzzling for a little while, they assembled the puzzle on the map and found the little hole that led them to their next location. They found the Detour as other teams started arriving at the Roadblock. Kami & Karli, however, were easily dumfounded by the puzzle. Not like they realize that the oval room in the white house doesn’t have corners…         The Detour this time involved Rock & Roll, and Hump & Ride. In Rock & roll, nice play on words to the producers, teams had to use an ancient method of transporting wooden blocks. Ball bearings in the form of logs were given beneath the stones and teams had to roll it, apparently across the length of a football field. It is, according to Phil, “physically demanding, but if you master the ancient art of rolling stones, it can be completed quickly.”         In Hump & Ride, which only Charla & Mirna arrived in time for, teams has to get on horses to guide camels with carpets on their bags to a carpet merchant. This task was entirely up to the moods of the horses, whether they went fast or not. I have a feeling with all those empathetic horse and camel rearers by Charla’s side, even helping her to get on the horse, they managed this task pretty fast.         And all the teams went to the pit stop, where the moms got last place. It isn’t a big surprise as there’s a Fast Forward. The producers wouldn’t want the Fast Forward to determine who gets eliminated, especially since they’re trying to downplay and eliminate the Fast Forwards. Anyway next week the mummies have to beg. Will they be wrapped up and sent into the tomb? I don’t think they would fit into one of those sarcophagus thingys!

      Wow! Ok... So today I got caught in ths thing that was shockingly similar to the "Don't talk to me!" from Lance last episode of the Amazing Race. As you all know, the one person I really can't stand in class is Kelvin Chen. With his whiny voice and incessant speaking when spoken, or even not spoken to, I have about this much tolerance left for him.  Well, I don't know if he's under the impression that we're actually on good terms, cause he actually dared ask me for help. During recess, I was casually walking to my seat when he cut right in front of me and went "Have you seen Liwei?" Really like Lance, cause I don't think he was expecting the person he hated most to talk to him. I honestly thought that "Don't talk to me!" was going to come out of my mouth, but instead, I just stood there for a moment and then shrugged. Ahah... That just proves that the "Don't talk to me!" was uncalled for! Boo to Marshall & Lance, who are rumoured to go next week. Thank everything on and off the earth should that happen!  Anyway why he asked for Liwei was because the estate office found out about the key. What happened was that the smartest boy in the class, Liwei, was handed the key on Friday to open the door back from the lab. He did the stupidest thing by throwing the key around and it eventually landed in the gap behing the whiteboard. Now it can't come out. Oh the irony that the smartest boy in class would do the most stupid thing! Anyway for a moment he thought he was doomed but "Oh my Saviour!" Kelvin turned out a duplicate key. Supposedly he was afraid something like that would happen and took the key for duplication, complete with yellow tag and class printed. He managed to dodge the estate for the weekend but yesterday someone returned late and the estate man took a look at the key knew it was a duplicate.  Ahh... Control freak Kelvin gets into trouble for trying to handle too many things at once. Another person's in charge of the key, but he, with his OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) about trying to be all responsible and running the class, has taken over since the start of the year. How much you want to bet he'll push the blame?  Oh yeah, more on class happenings... Toh Siew Tee, my Bio teacher stopped me after class today and told me I got full marks for the test. And she was giving me this toothy grin that reminded me of Dobby the House Elf. To think Kelvin Chen was actually trying to surprise me by studying and attempting to hit me off the Bio topspot! LOSER! I just have a feeling that the "Don't talk to me!" is going to come out of my mouth very, very soon...

      By  Ethan Alter   There's one thing you can say for sure about Bob and Joyce: These senior citizens definitely don't look like your typical Internet-dating couple. Still, the latest team to face Philimination on CBS's The Amazing Race (Tuesdays, 10pm/ET) was also one of the most popular thanks to their upbeat attitudes, strong racing skills and all-around good-heartedness. Here the New Jersey natives reminisce about their first date, and look ahead to the future.    Ethan: So tell us the story of how you met.    Joyce:  We met through Match.com. I had been a widow for a long time and didn't have much of a personal life. I was raising my three children and working hard. My son, who is a software engineer, told me, "Mom, you need a life. Go on the Internet. It's the only way you'll be able to do this." And I said, "No way." But he insisted and helped me put my profile on Match.com. Lo and behold, Bob came on...   Bob:  And I saw her profile. Actually, I passed over it several times because she looked like a girly girl and I was looking for someone who liked outdoor things. But one day, I read her profile and it said she likes outdoor activities. So I sent her an e-mail and the rest is history.   Joyce:  For our first date, we had drinks at a local restaurant. Afterwards, Bob walked me to my car and when I got in, I thought, "Yes!"   Bob:  I got back home that night and my daughter walked in. She knew I had had several dates on the Internet and so she asked, "Well, how'd this one go?" And I said, "This one went really well."   Joyce:  We knew immediately that this was going to be a long-term thing. The race just sealed it.   Ethan: Whose idea was it to apply for TAR?    Bob:  [Raising his hand] I was a fan of the show and, actually, I was already planning to do it with my brother-in-law. My hook was "Meet two brothers-in-law who actually get along." But then, I met Joyce and thought, "This will be a lot more fun." I knew she would go along with the application and I knew we were going to get picked. Two widowed people who met on the Internet and are active — we've got a few things going. Joyce didn't think so. Then we were picked.   Joyce:  And I was like, "I really have to do this now! What in the world did I get myself in to?" But I would do it again in a heartbeat, as long as I didn't have to eat any more caviar!   Ethan: Yeah, that caviar challenge looked positively brutal.    Joyce:  It was awful! We had already decided that I was going to do all the eating challenges because I eat virtually anything, and I do love caviar. But when I saw the amount of caviar, I was shocked! When I first started eating it, I was like, "Okay, this is gross, but I can eat it." But after a while you felt like you just had to throw up.   Ethan: Since you're both so Internet savvy, are you thinking of putting up your own website after the show is over?    Bob:  I don't know. It would be nice to hear "Hey Bob and Joyce, I took your advice and I met someone." That's part of our story. We hope we can encourage people to take a chance and get out there and try again. Maybe they can be as lucky as we were.   Joyce:  I would like to do that, if only to give people like us a means of support. If you are widowed or divorced, it doesn't make a difference how old you are. Put yourself out there. Take a chance. Every day is another experience. I tell my children this all the time: "Do something every day that scares you and you always will remain fresh." Bob laughed at me when I first told him that.   Bob:  I had heard to do something that scares you every once in a while, not every day.   Joyce:  Every day!   Ethan: Knowing what you know now, what would you do differently if you ran the race over again?    Bob:  We'd probably try to work with the other teams a little bit more. Also, don't always believe the information you're given. Double-check and triple-check everything.   Joyce:  Definitely stay connected to the other teams more; you never know what you can pick up. And the teams that are racing are very smart. It's so nice to see young people with so much intuition and the absolute moxie to put themselves out there and work it.   Bob: Overall, we're happy with the way we ran the race. We didn't want to screw anybody over or embarrass our children or ourselves. We knew we had a life to come back to after this — that was always in the back of our minds. We felt real good about doing the race the way we wanted to do it. And I think we had more fun than most people!   Joyce:  Because of this experience, Bob and I are going to backpack in Greece next year. You can go anywhere in this world — you don't need a tour and you don't need luggage. You can carry everything you need on your back.   Ethan: So now that you've survived the race together, have you taken the next step?    Bob:  We're not engaged yet, but we're confident that we have met the partner we want to spend the rest of our lives with. We're taking it a day at a time. This is real.   Joyce:  This is for real. We'll be together. He knows that and I know that about him. What will follow will follow, and we'll just take each day as it comes. I always said I don't need $1 million, because $1 million is fleeting. I got the biggest prize of all: I got Bob. It sounds corny, but it's true.

      Can you believe it? I actually went to Geylang yesterday, cause my dad wanted to try something new and there was like the supposed food haven. It was really an experience for me, cause I kept thinking of Amazing Race possibilities. Now who said Amazing Race could never come back here cause there's nothing left to do?  We were kind of stuck trying to find an illegal carpark somewhere along the street, cause there was no friggin space. My mom was wondering why people were starting to wear Red Shirts so early, something that I really laughed hard at. It's not like Christmas which starts early at November, mom! Apparently the prospect of National Day parade preview had never occured to her. Those cheap Singaporeans are out only for the freebies, who cares which day you go on?   Ok... Enough with the Singapore bashing, which will cease for the moment cause everyone that's feeling so patriotic will kill me. We went to this apparently famous for seafood restaurant, where there seemed to be some gravy left on the "cleaned" table by a very generous previous patron. I sat as far away from the table as I possibly could without looking too snobbish. My usual elbows on the table were drawn uncomfortably to myself. I drank the tea, which had some black dust inside. I couldn't help but to wonder whether it was cigarette dust or tea leaf residue. Unrealistic me... What are the chances of it being the former compared to the latter right? I don't even want to think about it.  The food was pretty good, but I much rather have stayed in the comforts of my home and da-paoed something from the Cze Cha just down the road. It apparently also got 5/6 chopsticks from Makansutra, which was the same as the restaurant we just went to. Anyway we got some of the famous Tanjong Rhu Pao and went back to our car. On the way back, we had to cross an overhead bridge. One half of the stairs leading up was occupied by creepy Indian men, and they all seemed so coordinated, sitting on one side. It was like in that childhood story, with the scary beast under the bridge that threatened to eat up anyone who tried to cross. We opted to brave the never ceasing current of cars instead.  There seemed to be some soliciting going on, right next to our car! The Indian man then proceeded to convieniently lean on our car when we were just a few metres away. I couldn't help but to pass a comment to my Dad saying, "Dad, there's a pimp on your car!" The Indian Man pulled away, and they carried their dealings somewhere else. I can't imagine how many deals my car must have seen through the night. Anyway, that's all for my experience in Geylang! I still have some paos left!

      If you ever see a random title, it's my opinions of the teams on each leg of the race. And it's starting to take form; the first one was Skrewts, a creature from Harry Potter. Now it's weasel. So if you just understood whatever the hell I just said, cheers for you. Here's the stuff!  Chip & Kim – The number one placing is very much undeserved. They have shown before that they are incapable of making flight arrangements. This week, they got lucky because Colin went all out to help everyone but Mirna. The thing is, you can’t depend on someone every leg, and you won’t be number one on the finishing line just because you can eat caviar.  Colin & Christie – I think they are one of the most strategic players to ever be in this game. They, along with Brandon & Nicole, see Charla & Mirna as threats and decided it would be best to try and bring them down. I really don’t like Colin’s dirty play, but it’s a really smart strategic move to try and get Charla & Mirna out early. Really, really bad choice getting a girl to eat when there’s a guy in the team. Guys are always stronger at these eating things… Just look at Fear Factor! Christie’s emerging as really bitchy. I know you’re all frustrated at having to eat salt, but no need to take it out on your boyfriend and another team!  Marshall & Lance – Same thing as Chip & Kim. These two got lucky with Colin playing dirty. You’re just pawns in his game, so watch out. I thought the “Don’t talk to me!” comment at the bus station when Mirna tried to ask you a question was really uncalled for. I mean, Mirna was actually trying to be nice and you told her to shut her trap. As the only other guy to have eaten the caviar, you really let your team down by doing it so much slower than Chip. I love it when you declared to everyone when they asked whether placings were still being respected, shows that you’re actually thinking of ways to get ahead. From then on, you just rode the “Colin help” wagon. According to the spoilers which have been accurate so far, these two go next week… Let’s continue hoping!  Charla & Mirna – Rock on gals! These two looked to be in huge trouble this time, but they managed to save themselves again. They have proved that they can survive independently, without any alliances and without any help from others. I really respect them for that, but a few friends won’t do any harm. Mirna is getting on my nerves, but I like Charla too much to make this team budge from my number one spot. As I said in my summary, I don’t know if they had secured on the connecting flight through Germany or just got lucky. If they indeed secured the Germany connecting flight, they’re the flight supremos this season. The editors very unhelpfully forgot to tell us when the Swiss Air flight would arrive compared to Colin & Christie’s flight. The editors might be trying to downplay them, lest they stick out as the winners this season because of their superior flight arranging skills.  Brandon & Nicole – I hate their strategy so badly, and it doesn’t seem to work. They make alliances that they know they will not keep, and benefit without benefiting others. I also hate the way that they keep proclaiming to be Christians. Christie said something to the effect of them being Christian, but they will be ruthless when it comes to competition. Something about playing well. It’s like saying “I’m Christian, but I will not hesitate to lie, cheat and steal…” What a hypocrite! Brandon, they one doing all the lying to alliances, states that he wants to live as an example to others, so won’t drink the vodka. So your living example would be to backstab whenever necessary? Stop contradicting yourselves, and stop reminding us you’re Christian! The fact that we know you’re Christian, and yet see you backstab people week after week is enough!  Linda & Karen – Queerly, we didn’t see much of them this episode. Maybe they’re not as interesting as I initially thought they were. I actually thought they are the female versions of Ken & Gerard, but now it doesn’t seem so much like it. They don’t have much skills in finding flights. I mean, Charla & Mirna jumped right to the front again with their skills, but you couldn’t? You’re losing your entertainment value in this season, and you’re not a very proficient team at the race. Your leaving would make more space for the more interesting teams to show!  Kami & Karli – Second to last, again? This teams physical capabilities has pulled them through so far, but their lack of brains will pull them down eventually. I really can’t say much about this team, cause they haven’t really been featured much. I admire the fact that they one doing the Roadblock was shivering when she was done. It was a much better reaction than giving up and sleeping like the other prom queens. Sheer grit and determination is what got her through. The comment about “We hate getting pushed back already” was a redundant statement. If you don’t like getting pushed back, do something about it…  Bob & Joyce – Awww… Last week I said that I was beginning to see why my friend liked them so much., and this week they are eliminated. I did say that they weren’t showing much character and will need to go if they stay this boring, but I didn’t mean this soon! Joyce ate the caviar fast, and she can be counted as a prom queen cause she’s a skinny female. She didn’t even flinch! We didn’t exactly see Joyce finish the caviar, so I kind of think the producers were kind enough to tell her that they’d already been eliminated. Bob’s words to her on the horse carriage sounded as if she was on her deathbed traveling around the world… Err… I don’t think I should be so mean to such a loving couple. I sincerely wish them good luck on their relationship, cause they look like they’re going to be a real happy couple together.
