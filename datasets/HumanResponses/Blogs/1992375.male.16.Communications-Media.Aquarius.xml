      Just got back from paintballing.... one word, pwnage. (that'd be me) We played the castle map at Fun on the Run in Lake Worth. First round was pretty lame. At first we guarded the castle and I got out within 5 minutes of the match... But when the tables turned I was storming the castle covert from the side with some friends I met there from school. When it came down to about 2 minutes I stormed the back entrance and hid in the moat for about a minute, but when the ref called 30 seconds i just ran thru the door, getting shot every which way. People who were already out said I looked like I was in the Matrix. Pretty 1337. got shot 8 times all over. We didn't win the match, but we had fun anyways.

      Just got back from the football game at the high school. Of course we lost, we usually do. I think the score was some where along the lines of 40 to 6 but thats not important... we still lost.  Just sitting here relaxing to the nice sound of Cheap Trick on my stereo... but thats another story. Sometime I have to force myself to go to either Hot Topic or Pacific Sunware to get a new hackysack, the one I have is too small. Got the go ahead on the blogger hoodie. Look for me in it when it ships.

      any ideas on ways of making good money... i thought about sticking an old p2 266 mhz machine with 64 mb of ram and win 98 outstide of my firewall to install those little programs that have the toolbar so you can 'earn money while surfing'. now i know what your thinking. thats a bunch of crap right? well im going to try it anyways.. its not like i have anything to lose really when you think about it. and if it gets me an extra 30 bucks a month maybe its not that bad? lol still have about 1700 dollars to go on my laptop funding, which is the reason im asking your suggestions on money making opprotunities. if you have anything send me an im. ill post my info somwhere on the site

      trying out this new program called w.blogger got it at websttack.com. pretty sweet, includes all types of different add-ins for my blogger account. messing around with the media thing right now, i am listening to NOFX, Dinosaurs Will Die but the program wont seem to pick it out of winamp. wonder if i have to use windows media player, who knows, i will continue to screw around with it for a little while longer. **note.. turns out you have to have windows media player 9 with the blogging patch installed, so i am downloading that now. pretty soon you just might be able to see my true taste of music.

      Got back from the 'Saturday Night Coffee Haus' held monthly at my church  urlLink RHCC . This 24 piece jazz band was fantastic. Most of the music they played was praise but they snuck some secular music in like, Glenn Miller's, In the Mood, which they have revamped it to 'The  In  Mood'. Anyways, you can check out their website  urlLink Here . If you like swing music, I encourage you to try their CD. I bought one for myself. The price is a litte high though, at 15 dollars, but trust me it is well worth the money. For now, that is all.

      School is such a drag. BORING.... We do nothing but use our brains to do complex equations and write thirty page essays on the things no one really cares about... seriously, when are we going to use this stuff? LOL. As if that is not the question teachers get asked thirty times day. But think about it, if I were to become some master programmer.. Would I really need to know the history of some guy who pulled a sword out of a stone? Or Shakespeare's plays about insest and bloodshed.. But I can't wait until Max Payne 2 comes out... Only 14 days and counting, or something like that. Ah well, its off to church so I can play with the uber-expensive toys.

      man havent written in a while, guess ive been too wrapped up in school and programming. not a good thing... been programming mainly websites, never can do to many of those. especially if you make good money off of them. couple hundred for an overnight project is not bad at all. my only source of income besides building computers and working for my dad's computer business. work has been slow for him, so im kind of hoping that he will get some business so we dont get into any problems or anything... on a brighter note,  urlLink we had a lan party at school on friday . the third or fourth one for this year, it was good for the most part, until we had to get on the internet.... all me and a couple of friends wanted to do is just play wolfenstein enemy territory, but when armstrong found out he bout had a cow, or did he? he kicked worley out, and the rest of us guys left and went to mcdonalds, then back to worley's house to have our own lan party.... it was better than the one at school. mainly because we were allowed to use the internet to play the games, went good there, we played with d's  urlLink clan, [kp]  they're a pretty good group of guys... i was talking to them on ventrilo a voice chat program we use that runs in the background that lets us all talk to each other over the internet. [with pretty much no lag at all].... woke up the next morning and went to be  urlLink blue man group  concert which was one of the best experiences of my life. i totally reccommend it if you ever get the chance to go.... the "appetizers" as they called it [i refer to them as the people who arent as good as the other people so they have to open for somebody else] werent very good, but the intermission before blue man was awesome... i expected it to be lame but they had two of those little scrolling word signs that were arguing with each other and getting the audience to interact with them.. pretty cool, because it made the 15 min intermission go by really fast... i like that.... why cant all places do that, put out something that will entertain you while you are waiting to be entertained by the main group?? anyways thats off subject... back to the concert... who would of thought 3 dudes in blue paint banging on pvc would be an awesome musical group... not to mention the 5 drummers, 3 guitarist and the rest of the guys who plays with them... all in all the concert was good, and i really enjoy the music, my dad bought the cd and i have been listening to it non stop... partially because its an all out good cd... i totally recomend it, like i said above, i think.. dont remember, i think this is my longes ever blog... ill quit boring you now and go back to my cd, ah man i forgot i got to do laundry, oh well got to go for now but i will try and post every once an a while... [hopefully better than i have been] until next time... adios   [c]

      taking a break from all the gaming... pretty nice. got me server here next to the laptop. running all sorts of apps for our gaming experiences. nick crashed already, and i think worley is fixing to hit the sack also. or at least he is laying down on his bed. probably going to sleep... yeah im a little tired, and i will probabaly be going to bed soon too... as soon as i can find a place to crash, its not like the lan things where you just pick up a piece of floor next to a window and use the curtain as your blanket, but then again what do i know. ah well im tired of typing, and this music that is on the game D is playing is driving me nuts.

      soon i will have a moblog up so that you can see the stuff that goes on throughout my day. if you dont know what a moblog is, its when you have a device with a camera and you upload the images to the internet.. i have already created my textamerica account and now i just have to get my camera-phone. i went to the att store today to pick up the sony ericsson t616 but they were out, and they expect them to be in on wednesday. so guess what i am doing wednesday? i am going by the att store on my way to church so i might even have a pic up for you that night of my sound board that i get to play with at church.. all depending on whether or not i have enough battery to send a pic. i hope so though :)

All in all was a good trip           &nbsp;         Went to circuit city this afternoon and got a new stereo receiver, sold mine to my dad because he wanted 5.1 in the living room and it wasn&#8217;t doing me to much good with a 6.1 speaker set. So I went out and was looking at the  onkyo  txsr502, about 300 dollars, and I decided to get the txsr501 for 249 so I saved a little money. Just got it hooked up and it is  friggin  awesome sound.

      Surfing the internet for crap, came across this site where people can post their songs they have written to allow other people to read it, and I have to say I am impressed. I wish I could write as good as some of the folks out there. I was just thinking to myself how cool it would be to write a song and actually have it recorded with music and everything. I personally don't care if it gets anywhere, just a dream I've always had.  School was good today, didn't really do anything to speak of, but watch a couple of movies. Just over a week until we get out of school. I believe it is 8 days or something like that. This year has really gone by so fast. Next year I'll be a junior, oh what fun that will be. I think I'm going to get me something to eat.  chris  Listening To:  99 Steps Closer - Linkin Park feat. Jay Z

      the trip to ruidoso was awesome. we had the greatest host parents in the world. they cooked us steaks and let us take the car whereever we wanted to go. there were six of us that had their whole downstairs. me, phil, adam, rosier, brady and landon. we had 3 bedrooms 3 bathrooms and a closet that had a closet on it. the bathroom upstairs had a urinal in it which is the coolest thing ever, i think. and the kids at vbs were awesome. i had dinner at the outback steakhouse with my prayer partner that i didnt even know before, and we revealed who our prayer partners were afterwards. my prayer partner was courtney fikes, she is really cool and hopefully i will get to know here more. thats it for now.  peace  chris

Two nights of severe weather, got to love it. The part I really like about it is getting to listen to the Tarrant County RACES. They always have interesting stuff on there. If you have a scanner the frequency is 146.9400. Its only good talking when there is severe weather going on. Last night was pretty  good,  hail and everything, but tonight, church got cut short.  Hatchett  stormed in towards the end of class, and told me to give him some power to his  microphone,  got up to the front of the room and said the sirens were going off in Richland Hills [which is where the church is]. So we either had the choice to stay in the HS room, because that&#8217;s on of the storm shelters in the church, or we could leave. Since I was riding with Phillip, we left and stopped by the Diamond Shamrock, on the way to his house to get some a 79 cent 32oz coke. When we got back to his house we sat in his room for about 20 minutes looking at the radar and then decided to go the City of Lake worth PD because the night before Phil was there with Joey until about 3 o&#8217;clock. We sat up there in the dispatch and not much was going on, so we got Joey&#8217;s scanner out of his office, and since the power was out, and they were on generators there was no power in Joey&#8217;s office, so we took the scanner to the computer room, bad idea, the room is like made out of bricks, so we didn&#8217;t get any signal, we decided to go and get an extension cord to set by the window where we got to listen to all the good stuff going on RACES. Once the storm passed over we headed back to Phil&#8217;s and here I am no back at home, tired, and fixing to go to bed.           &nbsp;         Chris

      from the (g4)techtv messageboards [bah I hate saying g4, its so stupid.     lets have the tally:  Martin Sargent: Appears to be going to G4techtv. Cat: CONFIRMED to go to G4techtv. Don't know what show. Roger: 90% sure to go to G4techtv. Don't know what show. Adam/Morgan: VERY likely to continue X-Play on G4techtv. Kevin/Sarah: "On the fence" with word "coming soon." It appears they were offered positions and are deciding if they should accept. I assume they would be on TSS still. Pat Norton: NOT GOING TO G4TECHTV when TSS moves on July 2nd. It's over. :-( Leo Laporte: No negotiations on going. It appears he will continue doing 2 minute TSS segements from home for now. Things could change but they don't look good. Jessica Corbin: No word. Chris Leery: Appears out of the network. Yoshi: Told a TSS audience he is likely not going to G4techtv. Dan "Foo" and others: Who knows?  Very sad. Leo and Pat are the network. Now neither will really be on it soon     I don’t know what I am going to do without half the cast of TSS. Comcast has defnitely kille the tech in the channel. Now its all lame gaming [not even fps but rpg and mario kart?]     I think im going to crawl into a hole and cry      chris   Listening To:  For Those About To Rock - AC/DC

      yo yo yo,  finally, we stopped working on the theater today, and the green room is well. green. xbox green to be exact. it looks awesome.  I sort of cant wait until school starts.  some of my classes will be awesome while the others will suck. heres my schedule.  intro to computer maint - armstrong  [this class is going to be awesome] us hist a - meeks eng 3a - calkins [never heard of 'em] span 2a - newcomb [same class as my little bro] tech theater - wilson [fun stuff]  this year wilson wants me to do video stuff for R&J [our fall show] which will be awesome. Hargrove [sp?] and Wilson have some really extreme ideas and i think the show will rock. then in the beginning of 2005 we get to do Godspell. which we are going to turn into this killer rock show that will have lighting out the wazoo, and a band on stage. i cant wait for that also.  the intro to comp maint. is going to be awesome because army will be  teaching us the computer stuff [a lot of it i already know, i am just taking the class because the school district is going to pay for me to get my a+ certification which will look really good on your resume when you go to apply for a job that involves you working with a computer.] most of our lessons will be online, but its all good.  anyways.  thats all i have for now, right now i am rocking out to "by myself - linkin park" good song.  i will update you with some more useless information later.  peace  chris
