      that's it. in less than 24hrs, i'll be leaving this island where i've been staying comfortably for the past 25 yrs of my life. it's time to move out of the comfort zone. excited? not exactly. sad? hmm.. i dunno. a tinge of nostalgia perhaps. having met so many ppl over the past week. it's amazing how much time i can squeeze out to meet ppl whom i've not met for such a long time and spending this quality time with them made it harder for me to leave the country. But still i have to go. it's a desire n ambition to be accomplished. sacrifice to be made. no matter how much it gona hurts tomorow, seeing the teary eyes. i have to be brave. to take it like a man. how long can i endure it? i duno. but i hope i have the strength to pull it thru for it will be a nite to be remembered forever.

      i still can't take my mind off that image from my mind. that image of beauty. she's 99% to what my defination of beauty is. i'm absolutely awe-struck and mesmerised. i know.. i shouldn't be having this sort of thoughts but somehow i can't help it. it's just too irresistable. i thought after a few days, it would just come n go... apparently. that image is still freshly coloured in my head. what am i supposed to do? pity she smokes tho. sigh.

      i've finally opened up my CPF investment account. did everything within the space of an hr. Unbelievable. At least i know i'm putting my money to good use rather than earning a miserable 2.5% interest fr the govt. Well, other than that, nothing much for the past few days except meeting up with frens and finally met J. A very close n personal buddy of my gal. It was a strange, trippy feeling. it was odd. i mean this is the guy whom had a rather intimate relationship with her and here i am smiling, chattin with him as tho he's just some guy fren. i'm not sure if that is the way i should be reacting or otherwise. Whatever it is... it was a feeling that took me a while to digest but overall, he is a pleasant lad with a pleasant gf and it was really nice meeting him for the very first time. Happy? not really? mad? neither. So what it is? nothing perhaps. just a peace of mind that's all. at least now i know what sort of person he is and what he looks like. am i being very fair to myself? i have really no idea.

      i realised looks can be deceiving. i mean what u see.. may not be wat you get. it's just one of those visual perception yr mind interepts. just like in the move, matrix, "what is real?" Oh well, as one always say, first impression counts but is that the real you or just an image potrayed to impress? u be the judge.

      Well.. what can i say... it's almost a month since i am here in down under. so far it's been choppy and the amount of tiffs we had are slowing chalking up. It's not suprising that things are turned out this way. I mean it takes a lot alot of effort to live together. It's funny. There are times where i actually like going to the library during breaks becoz it's so peaceful and quiet. i can have some time of my own. my world. i immersed myself into it and indulge myself in pleasures and doing things which no ones has an opinion or comment about it. I really doing my work, studying there. am i a freak? a loner? i duno how to define it now. i do cherished the company that i have... especially when those days or nites where i do feel shite and it's always good to have someone there for you.. i am just so contradicting isn't it? am i asking for too much? or this is what life is all about. Having and creating the balance between the love and hate; good n evil. Maybe the simple solution to it is to go with the flow... am i rite?

      it's only 3 weeks here and we have been going through the motion of debating with one another almost on a daily basis. Of course, i wouldn't say it's all fight and no fun. There are moments which i really cherished but in a long run, i have no idea how it will affect the mental and physical state of us. This is only the 1st week of lectures and i'm beginning to feel a'lil bit of pressure down my neck. Could this be the reason for not being in school for too long a period? I seriously think i am putting too much undue stress on myself. I should focus on my subjects at the moment and think about the rest later. There's just so much a mind can handle eh.    Sometimes i do feel lonely... i have yet made any frens yet during my lectures. The only ppl i've met and gotta know are S'poreans who are already here and studying in different faculties. It's weird coz i'm going to lectures all by myself in a new environment. No more familiar Asians faces. i am now the minority. No more comfort zone. In a way, it might be good becoz i get to concentrate during the lectures but i guess in a long run, it might prove unhealthy. Well, i guess i'll be making some frens during tutorials. It's smaller and promotes more interaction between one another. Will see how it goes then.

      It's 2 weeks since i came to Oz.... i'm not sure what else to expect in the coming weeks or months. Shall probably live day by day and see how nature takes its course. I realised that being with a person is easy but living with a person, breathing and eating in the same house requires lotsa efforts. How much are u willing to accomodate to the other person and how much are u able to tolerate one another's personal habits. I guess everything takes time. I'm not sure if i am able to take it but no matter what i can be sure that i'll be trying my best.    Todae we almost 'killed' each other. i almost wanted to throw in the towel and give it all up. But i did not. My level of tolerance is amazing. Sometimes i wonder if that's the best option i am taking. a choice is a choice.

      i seriously need a car. it's like without a car, i feel so 'handicapp'. Getting around places take ages and it does gets tiring after a while walking on foot. Well, still looking for a good bargain so that it can last me for my stay here in Oz. Life is getting slightly boring here, nothing much else to explore. funny how i seemed so excited to come here initially. hahah. so ironic. Oh well, whatever it is, i am making the best out of my stay here. i mean it's not often everyone gets the chance to stay here in Aus for a long period yah. Hmm.. i'm also considering the option of getting a PR. i wonder if that's a viable option.

      just came back from sydney. been walking almost the whole day non stop from day till nite. my feet hurts due to small sizes of my shoes. thankfully, there weren't any blisters. weather was cold and breezy while walking back home... sydney is chaotic...hustling n bustling with life in every corner... full of life in every streets. lotsa asians everywhere. Not exactly sure if it is a good place to study but then again, i'm sure there are more activities going in this cosmopolitan city yah. lastly, been eating so much today. unbelievable. i'm amazed with her appeitite. the servings here are tremendously huge. i have a feeling it could actually feed a cow. oh well, guess, there's just so much i could stuff myself. couldn't even finished my dinner. it was a turn off when i saw my food. natural body reaction i suppose. so much for sydney now... looking forward to orientation next week.

      I have a serious love-hate relationship with programming. it's driving me nuts... at the same time, i m getting satisfaction from it. It really sucks to be stuck in this pile of shite.

      For a while, i thought i have reached a point where reality hits u like a punch in the face. I didn't expected it and certainly unprepared for it as well. I certainly didn't know what to do or what to say. I was lost. speechless and for a while, i asked myself, "why?" Somehow or rather, i know for every problem, there is a solution. it's a simple equation that can't go wrong. am i being overly confident?

      I am having doubts about myself. I wonder if i have the ability to sustain my level of determination in my studies. i feel as tho i am reaching a point of saturation. I seriously hope it's just a temporary period that will ease away soon. This is the sort of emotions that will drag u to rock bottom and feeling the pits. I am stuck with one of the tutorial question and i began to ask myself, "can i do make it through?", " You are working hard but are u working smart?" i feel as tho i m not studying the correct, proper way. This is so ironic. Oh well, i should be more positive rather than being pessimistic about the whole issue. It's not the end of the world eh. I am keeping my fingers crossed big time.

      We haven spoken much since yesterday. even if we did. it's pretty monolosyllabic. It's not even a sentence but hell... this is the minimalistic conversation of the 21st century. Is this the beginning of Cold War 2? a standoff between 2 individuals who are living in existance yet denying each other's personal presence. It's so surreal. It's like the tip of the iceberg. u do not know what lies beneath. I am not perfect and i am guilty of my own flaws which i myself wish i never had. somehow i wonder if the problem is with me or am i looking at a reflection of myself thru others? it's a queer feeling that i am feeling. a twitching uneasiness that does not go away.

      tsunami hit again this afternoon. I have absolutely no idea what upsetted her. she started fuming the moent she saw me and i was absolutely stunned. 'what am i to say?' i was totally clueless and unsure what exactly was the problem that made her felt this way. I tried to find out yet it was all in vain. silent treatment seemed like an "easy" solution to her problem. i gave up as well coz i see no point in 'digging' out the truth. i just finished my class and it had been a long day of continuous lecture and tutorials. i was devoid of further energy to find out the cause. somehow or rather... things became fine after a while.. it seemed so natural as though nothing happened at all. it puzzled me but at least i know i am in the 'safety zone' now. i have no idea how long more this will go on when school work is starting to pile up... only time will tel yah.

      We almost broke up a few weeks back. but somehow or rather, we managed to talk things out. Spent a long time discussing all the issues at nite, thrashing things out and missing the lecture the very next day. It seems like there are certain expectations we have of one another yet we aren't aware of it. Misunderstanding of each other's involvment and role in a relationship. It's like threading in a minefield, one wrong step, KABOOM. that's it. You are engaged in a pyschological battle between the 'right' and 'wrong'. It is often frustrating. I am not sure how's our relationship is going to turn out in the future. I have seriously no idea about it. It seems like the 2 of us are getting weary and it is diluting the whole relationship. Of course, i do treasure the times when i am with her and they are one of the best memories one can ever have. I have learnt so much from her and i realised my life is so bland compared to hers. i duno know why either. Maybe it's just her personality... the catalyst of my life. At this moment, i am going to take one step at a time. Where is it going to lead me? I guess i will find out some day.

      i am feeling a mix of emotions as my dateline for my assignment approaches... it's tomorrow anyway. And i have yet complete 1 final task.... out of 6 fucking tasks... it took me almost a friggin month to reach where i am but it's not good enough. It is seriously pissing when things do not get done... So fucking frustrating. You spent shite load of time, reading, studying, doing the exercises, yet the output is not exactly as productive as you thought. This is shite. It is also a surprising fact that i am also catching the movies tonite... boy, talk about shooting myself on the foot.   I dun know... i was having this short chat with a fellow blogger yesterday and somehow what surprised me was when she mentioned a statment which i thought was uncalled for. she said, "well, problems come and go, unlike you *." I was surprised...i am like, "why do u have to compare yrself with me? does it make you feel better this way by putting someone down? i didn't really agree with what she said so i asked her what made her feel this way, she said, "Oh, from my senses and what * agrees too." Oh yeah. so together with another fellow blogger, both of u you feel the same way about me. Well, from what she implies, 'from her senses' i supposed she form her opinion and impression of me through all the conversations we had. and maybe she was a bad day yesterday therefore, the conversation was a tad bumpy... it didn't flow well at all. I mean she told me she hardly visit my site coz i am writing the same old stuff everytime she visits... whereas she has too much to write... well, so be it then... why the comparisions again? i feel that she's trying to be someone who's icy and almighty.. the kind of image she wanna potray is similar to the gal, Julia Stilts in "10 things i hate about you". She doesn't give a damn about anything whatsoever and being hard to get and stuff, it's like trying to be a feminist with an attitude... I mean why all the dramatic persona? even her blog, she is putting words like ," in my icy tone".... and the most prominent indication has to be her title of the blog... but of course, i ain't gonna mention it here. Well, therefore, i made it a point to be a pain as well in my replies with her. I was adopting the same tone of response as her..very curt and blunt. trying to be 'almighty' myself. I really didn't like our conversation at all... In a way it is sad becoz i always thought she can be a really nice friend but i guess...people comes and go and especially with the internet.. to lose a friend is as easy as erasing the words from yr notebook... once it's gone, it's gone... you write it over with something else.   Well, enough of the bitching here... after much cooler thoughts and calmer sense of mind, i figure that she might be having a bad day that's all and it's alrite if she think of me this way. To each is own. Hopefully, the next time round, she'll be having a better day.

      So here it is once again. Sometimes i wonder what it is like to be to attracted to someone else... i have been in this relationship for almost a year.....and i can't really remember what was it like to be attracted to someone... the feelings, the emotions of missing someone deeply, the thought of looking forward to that person each and every day. oh well, that's what being in a relationship is all about... being committed to the very person whom brings out all these feelings in the beginning. It's strange... i have yet seen anyone in school that caught my fancy. or maybe the fact i'm too oblivious to my surroundings could be one of the reasons too. So far, in this relationship, my eyes have yet wander around... and i thought if i do it, my partner will do it too, somewhat along the line of, "do what unto others do unto you". but it doesn't apply in my relationship here. It is pretty obvious what sort of nature she is. And that puts her in a more 'vunerable' position to stray than me. It seems like it the equation doesn't balance anymore if i am going by the rules.   It is obvious that anyone can see an instant connection between the 2 of them. I mean.. i'm not blind eh neither am i made of glass. This feeling sucks becoz there's nothing you can do and i do not want to ruin this friendship and relationship. I am the pivot that's supporting the 2. It is that fragile alrite. It's like... i dun want to make a huge fuss out of it yet i know there's something more to just simple flirting and all... i mean, it has come to an extent that whenever i know that my fren's around... i dun feel like seeing him anymore. It's like his presence puts me off now. it's worse if i see her alone with him, like the nite at the dinner... i can't help wondering what was going between them. Kinda shitty eh. Yeah, i know it's sooooo typical pyschotic boyfren behaviour rite? but i SERIOUSLY hate this sort of feelings. In fact, i DESPISE it!! Given a choice, i rather not be like this. It's not by choice i am feeling this way. circumstances force me to. Things have become to such extent it made me very conscious of their every movement, every behaviour. Even tho she assured me there's nothing go on between her and him, i mean, who can denied the fact they have already crossed the boundaries of a relationships. how can u expect me to simply believe when every time i see things and actions that totally contradict your words? tell me?? I dun see myself as being possesive eh. I have given her all the freedom and space she wants. Just give me the respect i deserve. I am not sure how long can i go on feeling like this. It seriously sucks alrite.   Her outburst few days back... which says how short her temper is... made me think deeper about myself. I didn't screamed back at her becoz i was shocked and totally unexpected. I mean i was asking her some minor questions and yet it was enough to raise her volatile temper sky high. I really didn't see that coming alrite. sigh. Well, i guess she was frustrated with my lack of understanding of the issue and all i did was asking questions after another.... and that pissed her off eh.   We had really wonderful time together prior to that outburst... We spent quality time doing stuff together and chatting with one another...it's almost like being in love once again... the physical touch, the words... we were totally in our own world... pity...all good things must come to an end eh.. how dissappointing.   Maybe it's better to let things take its course... i have too much things in mind, school's started, my assignment, my exams...I am trying extremely hard not to let it distract me. Maybe it's better to live and let live.   I wonder if i will die young....

      I duno know why. i mean everything looks fine on the surface and i always thought things are going smoothly between the 2 of us. but the funny thing is, why do i have thing naggling feeling deep inside me that doesn't really assure me? Well, could it be that i m partly insecure about myself? i duno. It's possible tho. I mean why do i get uncomfotable when she could get along so well with all the guys... to the extent of almost flirting with each other right in front of me? Am i being too kind or am i just making a huge fuss out of nothing. It seriously disturbs me deeeply. Well, frens are frens...but the kind of interaction between guys and her somehow doesn't equate to just frens... I mean, i dun think i m restricting too much on her eh, in fact, i m giving all her freedom she wants and here i am, suffering in silence. I feel jealous in some ways becoz she has this ability to get along with all the guys she meet and when i look upon at myself, it doesn' seem like the case. most gals i meet are more of a friend status. nothing more. Sometimes i wonder how would she feel, if i am the one that's being so friendly-till-i-am-flirting kinda mode with the gals. Man, am i being mean to be thinking this way.... an eye for an eye? Well, the one reason why i was attracted in her first place was her outgoing, bubblicious nature. she seems to have so much energy in life and always see the positive side of things. She's able to bring out the fun and laughter in me. She's able to make stuff that boring into the most happening things in life. She's able to light up my day with her most exaggerated thoughts and quotes. She's like the one complimenting my darker side.the balance of yin and yang. It's like she's able to have just as much fun, with or without me and that made me feeling in a state of loss... an inferiority and fear that i wouldn't be having as much fun without her.   i know i am not perfect and there are times i think i'm guilty of neglecting her, causing her an alarming amount of distress... well, come to think of it, i should improve on myself.... I dun think i have been a very good bf and i am really surprised she is so tolerant of me considering her unpredictable temperant. I always feel that she's able to get any guy she wants... it's true becoz there's just something sexy about her character itself that speaks volume. Most guys i'm sure will be attracted to it. I mean i am a guy myself and it was her out-going nature that first caught my attention.   Am i simply being insecure? maybe i am. it is really ironic because... she mentioned to me that i am able to get any girl i want and she was 'surprised' that she is with me. Sigh. ain't life an irony? The reason why i am feeling like this todae is becoz all the way she was 'interacting' with my guy fren. I mean to her, it might be just plain fun.. but no loh, the signals are blatant...i was observing and yeah, i didn't feel too good about it. I didn't really question her about it coz it might seem like a trivial matter and i ended up talking with her about some other issues instead... related but not directly.   Sigh. it's never easy being in a relationship. I have my fair share of ups and downs. There are moments which i felt on the verge of breaking point and there are a couple of times which i was shedding tears silently. my heart sobbing. (i guess it's a guy thing not to been with yr tears rolling down yr cheeks) The amount of times i have teared within this few months is more than i have been through in my entire life..... this is when i felt the most vulnerable and lonely yet there was not a single soul whom i can speak to. It is really sad. Sometimes i wish i have a few more closer frens whom i can seek solace and help but sad to say, it ain't the case. affairs of the heart and soul is usually harder to discuss with among guys. The only comfort i have is to pour my heart out into a unlimited space of the virtual world. Beneath that annoymous nick, i am able to express my rawest emotions. In a way it protects me yet at the same time i wish someone out there will hear me. It's like a prayer waiting to be answered. Sometimes i wish i am a girl instead.... well, life is not what you expect when u have it. Humans are never satisfied i guess.  I think from now onwards, i am going to cherish this relationship as much as i can. No matter how it's going to end, or what it is going to become...at least when i look back...i know i have put in my heart and soul into it. Good nite. sweet dreams.   I dun know why but i hardly slept the whole of last nite. i went to bed @ 1am and i was awoken by 6am. Trying not to waste the morning, i woke up logged onto the net and try to finish up with my assignment at the same time.   So much thoughts ran through my head last nite but somehow nothing seemed to make a difference. i am still the same usual me and she, her usual self. Luckily it didn't caused a panic attack in me. I am glad in the sense, i have some quiet time of my own, doing my stuff... blessing in disguise perhaps?   I told myself... there is no point in dwelling so much. Maybe we ought to talk about it again but i guess at this very moment, the time is not right. Life has to goes on.

      I dun feel right at the moment...call it depression, schizo, psychotic etc. Whatever it is...i am feeling the pits now and i simply dun give a fuck. i wanna scream out loud, my anger, my hatred, my inner-voice that is waiting to unleash its fury..."FUCK YOU WORLD!!! Why does all the crap in the world happening to me?!" I WISH FOR A BETTER LIFE!!!!   i wish my parents are well-off enough to lead a comfortable lives. because...  they truly deserve more than what they are getting now. they do not have to slog so much for a living and worried about our school fees and daily expenses. i do not have to worry about my uni fees. we can buy whatever we want. we can eat whatever we want. i do not have to worry about my rent. i can be more generous towards my frens and relatives.  the feeling of having just this much in yr pocket...is certainly demoralising. I am not sure how am i going to get through this period. I am reaching a point where a 'state of emergency' is gonna declared. I feel so lost and helpless... there's so much i wish that things would happen and some things wouldn't happen. It's so fucking shitty that i am now in a state where i am. I really dun know how or what to do anymore. I feel lost and helpless. I desperately in need of a hug. I need a listening ear. i am disillusioned. i am cynical and I feel like crying too. It doesn't make things any better now that my wrist is aggravated and it's hurting even more. how many more setbacks awaits me? Why is my life seems to be spiralling downwards while my gf's life seems to be striving in the opposite directions? i am happy for her yet the same time, i am feeling sad for myself. What can i do to rectify the situation?  How m i going to survive? i really don't know. I am not sure if i am on the correct path anymore. I dun feel like going to work but life has to go on right? no matter how miserable it becomes. Time waits for no one.. i am almost on the verge of throwing the towel. This is just too much for me to take it. who can i turn to? who can i speak to? will anyone transform my life those of a fairy tale with a happy ending? CAN SOMEONE SAVE ME BEFORE I LOSE MYSELF............................................. i am slipping away. i want the bests for my family yet i can seem to get it. WHY IS SO DAMN BLOODY DIFFICULT!!?!!!! FUCK!!! FUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH  FUCKKKKKKKKK ITT... i am extremely frustrated, mad, depressed, emotionally unstable at this fucking moment. It's driving me fucking nuts.   Some ppl have it all and they are taking it for granted while others, they are desperately seeking for a little bit more and how they got is shite. This is a load of crap. THe rich gets richer while the poor gets poorer. This is just so fucked up.

      I seriously wish that my family would be more affectionate and more expressive. I know this is abit hard to realise, knowing they are a bunch of traditional folks and it's hard to change them considering how old they are now. sigh. sometimes i wish they would be more responsive and speak from the heart, rather than their mind. this is the thing about asian culture. you do not speak from the heart. do u know what i call my family? Ice-block family. Everything is based on yr actions and interaction. quite sucky eh. I wish that there are more warmth in the family. this is what it lacks....warmth, love and affection. It's just 3 forms of emotions but my family is lacking it. They won't even talk about love in front of yr face and the parents just discussed it among themselves.They can't seem to talk directly but rather indirectly. Sheesh. what's wrong with them. I feel the distance growing apart. Kinda sad when i think about it and there isn't much i can do. I tried to improve it but somehow the respond is not very encouraging. crappy

      That nite didn't end well even tho the rest of the evening was great. I felt hurt, my ego's pricked, mad, upset and confused. Not that i am being paranoid again but certainly, what was going on before my very eyes dun lie. I mean, being high on drinks and doing all this things is not an excuse. It simply means that there is less inhibitions and you are acting on yr sub-conscious. And that, could perfectly mean the truth. Well, this is what i gathered from my observations throughout the evening. It was as tho, i was totally non existence and made of glass. Whatever that was going on, made me felt small. i didn't like that feeling a bit. It sucked. I was bottling those feelings inside me and the only chance where i could let it go was when we were alone....I talked to her about it in the cab. it was difficult. i didn't know where to begin or end..... but the bottom line is, we somehow managed to iron out the issue (almost) and i have decided to believe in her. I mean, she's my gal afterall....even tho things are in such a mess.... i am still pinning my trust on her. I do have fears of my own tho... i am not sure how i would react or affect me if the worst is to happen *touch wood*, i hope that at the end of the day, a ray of light will shine upon me. *keeping my fingers crossed*

      Once again, it's chinese new year. Nothing much forward to look forward this period. No decorations, no celebrations, no reunion dinner. Well, what can i say. it's gonna be just another holiday for me. not that i wanted this way but i guess it's all fated yah. 3 more weeks before i head back to down under and i have yet resolve this issue. Not that it worries me alot. Just the occasional periods where it hits my nerve and send me spiralling into a emotionally unbalanced state. It's a constant battle of right and wrong. I want to move on. Get over this hurdle that has bugged me down for months. I feel that it's not worth my energy and wild imagination to make my life miserable but I can't do it on my own. Sometimes, the parties involved should take the initiative as well, and should not leave me doing all the work. It doesn't work that way. You can't expect me to get over things when i still see him trying to flirt infront of me. Maybe to him, it's just a friendly fun gesture but not to me, it doesn't help on my situation at all. If you want me to pull myself out of this shite hole (Yes i call it shite hole becoz i dislike it. No one enjoys being in there) sometimes, it requires some efforts from them as well, do their part. Seeing is believing. My eyes still register him trying to be cheeky and stuff; I mean, i dun know how she's reacting to it and that kinda leaves me feeling unsure abt the whole issue. Actually, it's not just abt him but more of them. All their actions in the past had somehow puts me in a sensitive mode. much more conscious of the things they said and do when we are all around. maybe i am just reading too much of everything. i feel my threshold of tolerance is way too high. Sometimes, i push till the point where it really hurts me badly or things becoming worse before i talk things out. this is just so unhealthy. Well...the next few months is gonna be a challenge. Whatever's gonna happen will ultimately change our lives. let's see how the plot writes itself.   It was mentioned by him that 'it doesn't matter who you flirt, or kiss... as long at the end of the day, you are back to your yr partner, that's all it matters.' it does sound logically right but i feel it isn't morally correct and i cannot agree with him totally. i mean, there are lotsa other factors involved, you can't simply put it in such superficial terms. What about emotions and level of commitment to one another?? dun you have to factor in that as well? and sometimes what is considered cheating to some might not be considered cheating to others. The defination of it seems to exist within a wide margin. i feel it is a really tricky issue. No matter what, a line still has to be drawn somewhere. Being open doesn't mean i have to conform to other person's defination of liberal. Having a mentality like this is not exactly in my book.. Relationship doesn't work this way. Whether or not that makes me seems a bad person. i simply do not care. this is my side of the story. I am not expecting support or judgement whatsoever. i am just regurgitating my strings of thoughts from my head and in the process...crystallising them into words so that i can remember what was going in my life at this point in time.   this paragraph has no relations to the above stuff i wrote.... i was reading somewhere and i kinda agree with what this guy wrote. To put it in simple words, If and only IF....someday, when either of a couple has found new interests, i would very much rather they break it off rather than having an affair behind one's back. Personally, i feel that would that by sneaking around and upon being discovered make one feel like, in his words, 'a bigger fool' and it wouldn't be proper way to end the relationship. It is like a disaster waiting for happen and a catastrophe that has undesired consequences. Therefore, a nice clean break before any affairs will ensure a more dignified closure to the relationship.

       dun know why but somehow or rather.... i still dun feel right about the whole thing. maybe i am just being paranoid, my thoughts are churning much more than i can handle them. different scenarios replaying in my head and they aren't pretty pictures i tell u. Sigh...how i wish things didn't turn out this way but i know it's beyond my grasp and control. Nature took its course and things took a life of its own. what can i say? it's not exactly what i expect but then again, you can't have the best of both worlds. one hand, i am glad that puzzle seems to make more sense....but on the other hand, it doesn't necessarily makes me feel better or at ease. i really hate this feeling and i wish it will go away but somehow it doesn't. It's sticking onto me like a leeching, sucking every inch of life in me. Maybe i should just fuck it all and hope for the best? nah....i know i won't feel totally happy at all. sigh. or have i reach a stage where i can't bear to give it all up and i just want to posssess them, all for myself. seems rather selfish huh? oh well, all humans are selfish by nature. Every man for himself. it's only how much of a degree they are that makes the difference.   i guess when u have a gf that gets along so damn well with all guys, u really can't help but feel this way eh.

      i had so much thoughts in my head that i wish i can dumped them away somewhere.. ya know, record them into a machine or something hmm... a black box will be good. so that i can play them back as and when i like and not worry about it. anytime i need, i just slot it the tape and flick a switch. tadah! i am getting a big farking headache now. my head is pounding everytime i cough my lungs out. it's farking disgusting alrite. at this point in time, i would do anything to stop my cough and prevent my lungs from spilling all over.

      i was thinking to myself... i have to get my thoughts straighten before i get lost in them. somehow i have a feeling i am already beginning to lose it. Maybe there is still a bit of hope left.... How honest and truthful are we to our partner? trust is the foundation of all relationship... without trust, the relationship is good as dead. I have no idea why i have reached this sort of state. a state whereby sometimes i live in fear, insercurities creeping up to me. I don't remember me being this way in the beginning. Why? why have i become this way? sometimes i dun know what to believe... my instinct or my rational thinking. I guess along the way, everything is all messed up, entangled within the other.. i can no longer tell the difference apart. Seriously... i hate feeling this way and i wish there is something that can make it go away. i wish someone could help me, relieve me of this agony. My god... it's one of those days again. Will anyone be there for me?

      All of a sudden, i found myself sinking into a depressive mood. Maybe i do know the reason yet at the same time, i m not sure. There are so many factors that triggered my turbulent emotions. So many things that are beyond my grasp and i really wish i can do something about it. I wonder why my life is so full of obstacles and difficulties.. are they created by myself or is it becoz of my fate? i sometimes wish my life would be in a better state but somehow i seem to be experiencing all sorts of issues that simply throw me into a state of uncertainty. Have i chosen the wrong path in my life? are there other ways to experience an easier and comforting life? i love the ppl around, yet i'm unhappy with my life. There are just so many things i wanna change but i have so much constraints that are preventing me from doing so. Life goes on, i still go to school, i go out and and fun and i have a comfortable place to say. BUT beneath all that, there are many issues that say, "look, u are in a huge mess. how u gonna save yrself?" I know that i can give a call back home and probably that will be an easy way out but then, how much can my parents help me? i dun want to be a burden for them coz i know how hard is it for them to be supporting a portion of my education here. I am already contented with that and i try as much not to be dependent on them. sigh.  I'm kinda stuck at a dead end at the moment. i really hate it when things get undone. I wish that everything will just fall into place at this very instant and make my days easier to go by. i feel like switching myself off, and not think about anything at all. A totally blank state of mind is what i'm looking for. i dun know which direction i should head or what should i do. I'm in need of salvation.

      alot of thoughts came to my mind on the way back home. listening to jay chou's 'An jing' on repeat while i am driving. Yep, just that one song. I dun know the real reason why i am listening to that song so much. It's like... it puts me into a solemn mood. i believe it's a sad song yah... but somehow i feel calm about it.. it's like i actually enjoying dwelling in that sort of mood. it's like slipping into a comfort zone and not wanting to get out of it. I feel like i'm shutting myself beneath in the shell (i.e car) and live in my world. At the same time, i began to ask myself... why didn't i have more frens in uni? i do know ppl yet they aren't exactly frens... more like uni-mates. conversation topic resolves around school and that's pretty much about it. Sometimes i wish there are more to it but it's not easy to build up a frenship eh. Considering the fact that we only see each other 2-3 times a week. I can't envy some of them whom know loads of ppl, from different nationalities, different culture. It's so ironic, i mean, the thing about me coming to Oz was to get to know more ppl... yet somehow, i dun see it happening. Maybe it's me that's not putting the efforts in getting to know ppl or i can simply blame it on fate. *HA!* It's so farking ironic eh that here i am talking abt me enjoying the time being alone, feeling depressed and complaining about not enuff frens.   I caught Last samurai last nite. I thoroughly enjoyed it even tho it was rather predictable. It made me forgot abt my crappy lab test which i did in the afternoon. shan't talk about that. There were loads of ppl at the theatre and i bumped into this gal whom i think i've seen that day at the post office. I wasn't exactly sure but i have a feeling she is. i was looking at her for a while and perhaps, too long... coz she 'caught' me looking at her. oops. Well, that was about all which was interesting. Then it was time for home.   my hopes of getting PR here in Oz seems to be fading. doesn't look like it's gonna work out since a lot of factors are against me. Sigh. I realllly wanna stay here for a few years. i do not want it to become a history where i can only look back. i want it to be present. i.e me, staying here. i am dreading the day my visa expires... the image of me packing up, with my airtix, all ready to go home is rather disturbing. I mean, not that i ignoring my home or folks back in SG but somehow there are so much more to offer here and i want to experience it all before i m ready to go back.

      This is no longer an issue for me but what this person (another blogger) wrote in the entry really sumed up the emotions i was going thru a while back. It is very well written and i can totally relate to this person....anyway here it is....  "not too long ago, XXX and me had this issue between us - our past loves. we all have them, our histories, our pasts, people whom we've fallen in love with, given a piece of our heart away to. but then where is the line drawn?   for me, rather sadly, i don't keep in contact with most of the people i've loved. somehow, it never worked out very nicely in the end. conveniently for me, i guess, i don't commuincate with them. surely there is a place in my heart for the few i've truly loved, well namely two, a & b, but things are different now.  XXX on the other hand, still communicates with the people he's loved before me, and still loves. they will always occupy a special place in his heart. (i believe if you've truly loved someone, you never stop loving the person till the day you die. you might love less, but you never stop). i used to get jealous and uppity about it, especially the times when so and so's name would be mentioned oh so often, and he would speak of them in glowing terms, almost like someone who has a crush. these things riled me up. he would say over and over again, "but you've got me now. i love you. i don't see why you should get jealous over the fact that i still email and chat with them, or want to meet up with them when they're back". what didn't help as well was the fact that the previous guys whom he fancied and never got, which resulted in me thinking i was the consolation prize in the past..., and that he still liked them cos he never got them.  it's been about slightly less than a month since we've had another one of those conversations. i can fairly say that the issue's over. while yes, there sometimes is the nagging fear that my bf will cheat on me, or that his heart might stray from me, it isn't any different than any other person would have. ie. the size of that fear now is normal. and sure, once in a while i worry, when he starts talking about so and so, doing this and that...  but you know wat.. it takes two.  on his side, he's put everything into action, and not once given me doubt about his love for me. his actions, as thus far, have proved more comforting and assuring than all the words he could ever say. he's always been a person who doesn't believe in words that much, it's the actions that speak loudest, he says.  on my part, i've had to realise that it's different for him. unlike me, he still keeps in contact with the people he loves. and while they will occupy a teeny spot in his heart forever, i've got the bulk of it. and i've got nothing to fear.  faith and trust. two words that hold up a relationship.   and they can't be spoken."

      I dun know where my future lies.... i'm wondering should i stay here in OZ get my PR or to chase my dream of getting into one of the airlines back home? sigh. both have so much to offer. My good fren has already given up hope of trying in SG and he told me that he would very much head to down under and try his luck. He was saying i have a good opportunity of trying my luck in Oz since i am already pursuing my studies here. This is not an easy decision to make. So much so that sometimes i dun know what i want anymore. Was looking thru some pilot training brochures and was very much tempted with the course. If only i have an extra 4.5K... i can easily get a Private license which i am sure will no doubt boost my chance. It's like a dream that's forever hanging in the air and i am having difficulty reaching it. I was thinking about my fren who's currently in France.... on his way to becoming a fighter pilot. Life is certainly unfair. And another of my Indian fren who got thru the interview with SQ and in the process of signing the contract. I'm not being sour grapes here. I just can't figure out why is it that ppl around me seem to have it so much easier than i do? is there something that i lack? Is there certain X-factor that i have not yet attained?

      If you're mad with someone, and nobody's there to fix the situation...You fix it. Maybe today, that person still wants to be your friend. And if u don't, tomorrow can be too late   If you need a hug of a friend...ask her/him for it. Maybe they need it more than you do. And if you don't ask for it today, tomorrow can be too late.   If you really have friends who you appreciate... tell them. Maybe they appreciate you as well. That if you don't and they leave or go far away today, tomorrow can be too late.   I realised we do have alot of differences in our interests and sometimes i wish that we have similar likings. Sometimes i feel that i am unable to influence in the things i like. Most of the time, it's through others that u begin to take notice of what interest me. It's frustrating when i do take an effort to appreciate the things that you like. Why can't u? I'm not saying just becoz of one event which happened but many a times since we were together. Anyway, there are always two sides to every story and this is my side.

      I still dun feel very good about myself. Still not exactly in the mood for anything. I just do things to keep me occupied. It's a good thing that i was doing my assignments last nite till 4 in the morning. It pushed me to the limit and drains me both physically and mentally before i called it. In a way, i managed to get things done and logically speaking i should be satisfied about it. But i m not. Nothing seems to perk me up even tho for the fact that i managed to breeze through the lab test this time round.   What can i do to make me feel better about myself? instead of seeing myself in such ways? it is often said, that it's how u look one thing and form an impression of it. Basically it's the, "half-empty or half-filled" glass saying. Seriously, i think all this while, i have been putting myself down too much. So much to the extent, it became in-bred in me. It develops a life of its own, manipulating my conscious and mind. I feel crappy more than joy. It sucks totally. I go on in life as per normal. Ppl will not know that i feel shite about myself coz i know how sucky it is to look gloomy in a group. It's contagious and ppl do not like that. So i be my casual self. Take it as things go but deep inside. I'm suffering deeply, bruised and battered like a broken soul.

      I always like to think i am a simple person but somehow or rather i realised that is not true. I am a complex and complicated person. So much so that sometimes, i find that i can't really relate to ppl very well or ppl relating to me. Maybe i'm too much of an aloof person? i dwell in being alone? to totally isolate myself and not speak a single words. To save my breath for last. I'm not sure what exactly is wrong with me? Do i have a problem interacting with ppl? I feel like i no longer know myself or who i really am. I m not sure if the things i say, the words i type, the things i do even make sense at all. And i m simply just living each day without knowing why. What defines me? and how do i know that this is what makes me unique and different from everyone? In a positive way or an abnormal way? I feel that i have lose myself and i'm trying to be someone that ppl will feel comfortable with. in the process, i really think i am trapped in numerous mirrors of myself, searching for the my real identity. Is this how my life going to turn out for the rest of my existence?

      I saw her again. This morning while i was my hot chocolate at the canteen. She looks great with a black sweater and a colorful white shawl around her. Cute. Didn't dare bring myself to look at her for too long. It is not often u get someone who can send a tingle through yr heart and this morning, it happened again.  I wanna get PR here. Why is everyone getting such good offers or either that, they can get their PR so damn fucking easily?

      Here i am alone. sometimes i am tired of being alone, feeling like the odd one out. After almost a year of studies here, i realised there isn't anyone that i am close to and this is clearly evident when it comes&nbsp;to project work where there is hardly anyone i know of.&nbsp; Most of the ppl tend to stick around their own cliques, therefore it is hard for me to actually join the group. urgh. and i hate the feeling of going around asking if any group needs&nbsp;a member. i detest this sort of feeling. makes me feel like an outcast. It is so hard to make frens as most of the time, u hardly have the opportunity to get to know one another thoroughly due the difference in timetable and subjects taken and therefore the only time u see them is through weekly tutorial sessions. that's about it eh. I am going to graduate soon and i can count the number of ppl i know throughout my stay here. pathetic i would. it lacks diversity. whatever the feeling is, i know it is temporary and it will go away but somehow, looking back i can't help but feel the lack of frenships i made. that i find is somewhat of a disappointment.
