      this has been a busy couple of days lately. saturday was a scary day, i found out my aunt was in the hospital having emergency surgery when my mom and i got home from shopping. so we rushed out to meet my uncle and aunt to go to the hospital. then it took about an hour to find her due to the great organization and communication of akron summa hospital. but we eventually found her serious boyfriend, who i consider my uncle and an awesome guy, and then he got us to her. she did fine and came home that night. from the story she i've gotten that she had a fertilized egg but it didn't connect to the wall and blood was backed up. i don't really want to get in to the details but everything is clear and good right now.    after that event that put stuff in perspective i took a break from the world sunday. monday i discovered a new found love for snowboarding. the ski club went to holiday valley in new york, one of the most beautiful places on earth, and it was great. they have mile long slopes and 35 mph ski lifts. it makes boston mills and brandy wine look...... well pitiful. the bus rides were fun too. we watched signs, mr. deeds, and the mask of zorro. all were good signs was the best. on the way home i sat with kristen and i think we gave each other the colds we had from being around each other cause i was sick as a dog tuesday. i fell asleep leaning on her watching zorro and i think i mighta drooled. lol just playing. but to any girls out there: is that a turn off? i think it's kinda hot myself. anyways new york was awesome. if you ever get a chance GO.

      so today we had a pep rally and i sat with the freshman class and we had fun cracking on the cheerleaders, who i think weigh more than our defensive line. so the cheerleaders marched into the gym stomping their feet in a cheer and i turned to matt and asked him if he "felt the ground shaking" and it was trust me.   then later at the end of school, i was waiting for my mom to pick me up and nikki needed a ride home. so i was a gentleman and told her she could come with me. then steve ended up needing to go to roseland lanes (where i'm going tonight for cosmic bowling, watch out) to pick up his car and that's right across the street from my house so he came along too. allison was gonna come too then she went to go get something for drama and told us she would be right back. so it was me, nikki, steve, la shawn, and sarah (la shawn and sarah were waiting for their rides) just messing around for about a half an hour before my mom came. steve and la shawn had a mini street fight and steve ended up sitting on la shawn's chest yellin "what now mutha....." hilarious. so my mom finally arrived and allison still wasn't there. then we just left cause we figured she must of got a ride home if she wasn't back yet. and we then we left.  special note before i go is that this evening caitlin cormack is at districts in canton beasting in the 200 IM and the 100 butterfly. hope she makes it out but she's a beast either way.

      hey guys. welcome to my web log. i'm gonna do my best to keep this honest and updated. for all of you reading this that don't know me: i'm doug and i'm 15. i like to do all the stuff a teenager likes to do: sleep, hang out, play sports..... you get the picture. so i'm gonna end this "entry" with a funny thought.  me and my friend marcus were in biology today examining cells going through mitosis (i know aren't you jealous) and he told me about when he had been to a gymnastic tornament. eventually, we came to the conclusion that gymnast coaches for little kids are the meanest people to ever roam the earth. when you see them on tv they are always profusely sweating and yelling "you don't really want to be a gymnast do you!?" at little 8 year old girls. two more things come to mind: they always have an accent and are overweight. so me and marcus have decided we'll become our kids gymnast coaches as an outlet for our anger because our wives won't want to sleep with us. so it 20, 25 years we're gonna get fat, start balding, and never wear deodorant.

      it's a sunday night. right before all the good tv shows come on and you realize that next morning you have to go to school. tom cleaned out his upstairs and now it's a sweet little entertainment room with a tv, stereo, surround sound, and have the backseats of a grand prix as a couch. ended up staying most of the weekend over there. on friday marcus, angie, and allison were over there and it was alright but nothing tell the grandkids about. marcus and angie came with me and met up with kevin and his friend mike. that was pretty cool because mike is a real funny guy. mike made several unsuccessful attempts at angie. ex: as we're getting in the balough mobile we all find our seats. kevin is in the shotgun, marcus sits in the back seat bench, me and angie are sitting in the front bench seat which is designed for 2 people. then mike getting in last does not sit in the open back seat with marcus but he sits next to angie on the filled two seater, in the process scrunching me (i know you feel sad about it) angie just gives me a look and i try my hardest not to bust up laughing. she's the ice princess after seeing that.   then last night everyone from friday ended up at tom's again (minus angie) and we had movie night. it was more video game night, american pie starts to skip and black out right before the nadia scene, and a.p. 2 is good up until the lesbian scene. i found out that with surround sound pumped up grand theft auto sound like pretty real with the machine gun. then me and marcus slept over and allison left. tommy couldn't fall asleep so i kept him some company til 5. then i was like dude go to bed. then when i came home today i found out my boss called and caddying starts up again this saturday. yee-ha money again. but oh wait get to work by 7 am. yes!!! how lucky am i.

      today we had a power outage in beford. it happened for me in french class. me, allison, and marcus had fun while we were stuck in that room for about 2 or 3 hours. we had fun but weren't as bad as the spanish class down the hall that threw a piniata (sp?) out of the second floor window. devil children. then i was on the brink of ticking off dallas. i kinda hit her in the head with a gatorade bottle, but she was real cool about it. then she tried to throw it back and hit me but she busted marcus in the face. good stuff. well i'm tired from my hard day. i'm gonna clock out.

      right now you're reading the diary of the 2002-2003 bhs swim team male Coach's Award Winner. what did i do to deserve this award? threw steve's tee shirt in the water, busted megan terry's eye and nikki gaitlin's lip, and broke the clock in the locker room with a snowball. that is the integrity of an award winner like myself. always respectful of coaches and a hard worker. "c'mon guys stop f'ing around, this is high school" - something i would not say. but the winter sports banquet... that right there was my excitement for the week. wait i got a haircut and went to cooker's for dinner yesterday. ladies and gentlemen a tie for the excitement of the week. absolutely spectacular. today the weather is cold and windy, it's kinda setting the tone for today: i keep wanting to go out and do something but eventually it gets to be too much and i  have to give up and come back home. maybe to arabica with a small group of friends would cheer up things.   so the main topic of conversation with my mom and i happens to be the war with iraq. two people that have lived in the same house for 15 years could not have different perspectives on this stuff. she's totally war opposed, hates politics and me, i like the strategy of war and want to be a political analysis in the future. and my take is this war is a good thing because it will help major deal (not totally) with all that corruption and stuff that's going on. best of lucky and safety to the troops over there protecting us.

      tomorrow night is the winter sports banquet at school. i'm trying to decide what prank(s) i should pull and on who. maybe something that involves glue, it's gotta be memorable. revenge on the coaches? we'll see. but it'll be fun cause i kinda miss the fun i had with all the people on swim team. next year is gonna be depressing cause there will be 1 junior and then next in line is me and hryb. sophmore captains?? maybe... kinda sad for the team though. on top of all that we're getting put in a harder league. great... thanks guys. so today me and caitlin cormack talked today about her selling out on everyone. mighta pissed her off more but that's the end of me talking to her unless by some act of God she changes.  today i started with my brand new diet and work out thing. no pop, very sparingly chocolate, and not a lot of sugar + junk that's in the cafeteria. whenever i've got nothing to do and i'm sitting on my ass, i'll work out instead of playing ps2 (hard to give up grand theft auto). and lastly i'll try to run a couple miles each day. eventually this raggedy body will be in shape for summer.  i'll be a beast for golf team. grrrr....

      people at the eye doctor's place are absolute morons. the screw on mine came out on sunday so i went in after school today. one lady was there and we were 6th in the line of waiting customers. it took roughly a half an hour when somebody else decided to come to work. then the lady puts in a different, fat bronze screw in. what b.s is that? so me and mom took a trip to target and got a nifty glasses repair kit... all is well. also got some new pimp juice at the store too: axe's Orion. i tried out all the different ones, this one takes the cake.   at school i was ready for confrontation against anybody who is an asshole. but i wasn't mean at all to the people who are nice. eric yusko is a whipped man and now his girlfriend doesn't like how he acts around me, tom, and jack. then caitlin is a sell out around everybody. she's funny and can be a real good friend but give me a break. but today allison and tom hooked up but tommy should do better this time around. hopefully.   happy st. patrick's day

      weekends are the best thing in the world. no scratch that maybe sex on the weekend would be the best thing. very sadly i wouldn't know. i actually ended up going to bowling and woah: it was actually fun. i think it was cause there was new people. my house is up for sale again cause momma is pissed at the management people. on friday when marcus and kevin came over after bowling cause they were gonna sleep over and tom was with us. so a couple of people leaving the bowling alley that were drunk started honking and yellin at us (kinda funny). so we're laughing or whatever and when tom's mom picked him up she got stopped by the manger lady. and this lady was pissing at her about us. let's just say some people are bitches.

      this week at big bad BHS is proficiency testing. that means all of the non-learning disabled kids get to come in late and we all get shorter days. yay! for us. but momma sanders still has to go to her work at 7, so this week i've been going to tom's in the morning. that's where i am right now. tom is sleeping a few feet away and i'm very tempted to bust out a bottle of shaving cream. today i need to find something to do tonight. after having my fill and then some of bowling, we need to find a fresh new scene. this morning mom told me that she's gonna be home late and gave me like $20 for food. that may come in handy.    so yesterday i discovered that i am a targeted man. it seems marcus and brett have first period together. marcus started telling me about brett's grudge with moi. for everyone that doesn't know brett is allison's ex-boyfriend from like the start of the year. apparantly one day after they had already broken up he had let her borrow a sweatshirt or something of his. then he was talking to her in the hallway, here's where i come in, innocent ole me walks up and starts talking to allison. and then he says i proceeded to "feel up on her" right in front of him. now he wanted to beat up on me then and still does. this makes me laugh cause this was after she dumped him. i don't know if i did this but even if i did... buddy she dumped you already i don't care if i gave her a lap dance in front of you. today is gonna be funny cause brett passes me and marcus in the halls after lunch. so today something might slip out like "nice sweatshirt" or something along those lines.

      yeah, i've been doing a good job of keeping this thing updated. gimme a break i'm here. well lately i have been really sick, haven't missed a day of school though, but last friday i got some medicine. seems to be kicking in. of course my stubborn self hasn't been taking it easy and i'm sure it hasn't been helping. oh well i'll suck it up because i hate when other people complain about their aches and illnesses. so i think i need a new challenge in my life, things have been to easy, there's no edge to my life right now. maybe i need to focus on girls again. that might be what's making me bored with daily life. but i do not want any easy skank (all too common at BHS). a mrs. doug would need to make him work for her but also not totally put him in the dark.   anyways last week i found out marcus is moving to twinsburg in a couple of months and that bothers me. it'll be less interesting at bedford because he's a pretty hilarious kid. the second thing that bothered me about this news was that there's no real reason to move it's just that his mom wants somewhere new. i dunno just doesn't sound cool to me. today laughed at the news today. my old town, ravenna city schools had their bus garage broken into and some vandals shattered the windows and used the fire extinguishers on those bad boys. and channel 5 interviewed some kids that had gotten the day off from this tragedy. who else but scott trucker was interviewed. this kid was in my kindergarden class and he was the bad ass of the school. first kid i ever saw flip the bird and he has future garbage man written all over him. when asked when he what he thinks of getting out of school today, "i think it's aweosme cause we get out of proficiencies today." brought back old memories and got a good laugh.

      man everytime my mom and i get in a not so friendly period she does something that is hysterical and makes everything. very cool lisa, very cool. one of my neighbors kicked our cat now i'm suppose to blare some music. beautiful stuff. mother son bonding is the best. first days back at school drag on pretty long. all the good classes seemed to fly past while most of them didn't quite do the same... marcus and myself's 5 minutes of honesty is catching on. we had another one in study hall. nobody really got that offended this time, that's a first... my algebra teacher is the most clueless person i've come across in a long while. he gets verbally assaulted by most of the class and when i begin to feel sorry for him, he just does something that crushes my pity. he's not even getting the worst treatment in the school though. another math teacher gets chalk thrown at him. sorry guys but your working in bedford, u gotta keep your head above the water or you'll drown... well i'm gonna be studious and read some of Charles Dickens. i love school, what can i say?

      the last day of spring break... what an eventful day, i must say a couple suprises but most were pleasant others were not so pleasant. i had work this morning nothing too big happened there. came home and talked to liz. we came up with going to arabica and to the square for something to finish off break with. then tom got a phone call and he and allison came with us. marcus too, how could we forget about him. i got to the square first and liz was not far behind. we started to walk towards burger king where the rest of them were waiting. nikki g. and kristen stopped us and chatted. they were playing pool at cyber pete's (don't ask why they have pool tables... it's bedford, enough said). finally the rest of the gang met us when we made that pit stop. off to arabica, there we had 5 minutes of honesty... not the swiftest idea in the book. (by the way, check out www.urbandictionary.com and search for swifter, trust me it's not bad) but those were 5 brutal minutes. for me it was pure entertainment but for everyone else it was pure hell. allison took it the worst, i feel moderately bad, for the rest... they laughed about it after. we talked about relationships, which frankly is none of these peoples strong points or in ms. morell's words... fortes. then we headed down to the waterfalls behind like Papa Johns, i forget the name. but they were cool. the water was absolutely sickening though, straight from the sewers. there was some moron photographing it, what are you thinking there chief? take a picture of some chewed gum or something productive. maybe some cutie's backside?... anything but that. this was where marcus and liz's relationship ended, but it was peaceful, nobody whipped out their "9s" and capped each other. then back to tom's house, we saw a beautiful 2000 eclipse V6. red. gorgeous. well i have to brush my teeth before that perverted old lady comes on oxygen and shows her expertise on everything that is sex.

      today was another chill day at the sanders house. i did a lot of cleaning for my mom, earned a stupendous $10. feeling like an entrepreneur or something. pimp juice lemme tell you young man/lady... today i discovered i've passed marcus as the best liar in bedford (in the category of going of college and not jail during the next 5 years). he was gonna come over at 6 and claims he called at 5:45. nice try buddy but i have caller ID. effort points maybe? kevin and i had 2 showings of saving private ryan and american pie 1. american pie is the greatest movie ever, i'm sorry but what even comes close. titanic? gladiatior? please, give me a break here. watching jim and the sock and of course the pie: what could be better... i talked to liz a couple times today. a couple people went down to cleveland to try and get tickets for the brand new concert. not a full proof idea i might point out. but hey you can't blame them for trying. then mallory called and we chatted for a while. she's going off to disney for the second time this year. give me a break. just playing sis... yes veronica, i did read that post with me in it. i'm meDoug everyone! and i don't care who knows it. what are you talking about driving range? we were never at a driving range. wink, wink... now everytime 'A Tale Of Two Cities' comes into my sight i feel imtimidated. maybe cause its about 3 times bigger than any book i've ever imagined reading. maybe tonight there'll be a nightmare about that book chasing me and eventually tackling me with it's massive size. it's 12:10, do you know where your kids are? i really could care less, go out and rob a liqour store little billy.

      this is the second try at an entry today. the last one got lost when i tried to submit it. i'll suck it up and just re write it. yesterday's day at the mall was cool, i came home with a billabong shirt and a pair of cargo shorts. christine called to see if she could come with us, didn't think it would be a problem. i was proven wrong as liz and christine had a few very annoying spats in the car and throughout the mall. not cool at all. after the mall we went to arabica with angie and john. it was alright but nothing to wake the neighbors up about. after that we went to allisons. on the way me and liz played that psychology game where you say the first thing that pops into your head. it was quite interesting. then we had to cross the colombus bridge. it feels like it moves everytime a car flies under. i got motion sickness or rather disoriented half way across. i wonder if people walked across bridges instead of drugs and alcohol, how much better of a place would the world be? so once we got to the waple residence (allison's) we played hide n seek. man little kids have the right idea. they make their parents buy them toys, they play games all day, and they get nap time. how good is the life of a pre-schooler?... today my cat puked in my room and i was inspired to clean. the place looks a little less shabby now. almost presentable... i realized my ignorace of the world and its history as i started to read ' A Tale Of Two Cities' (sorry this web log site doesn't have any underlining, so sue me). i made it all the way to pg 2. already it feels like this is educating me more than all my past years combined. all i can think is 2 down, 464 to go. nothing too big... man my mom is the greatest right now. she ordered up adelphia powerlink today. digital cable and fast internet. i think i'm in heaven.   a cd worth listening to: Juliana Theory- Love

      easter had some pretty hilarious moments in the sanders' household. at dinner my uncle described how his dog had humped the neighbors dog, the neighbors bo  y dog. so then on the ride back from solon my mom hands me the keys. doing fine and we're driving up broadway. she tells me to pull in to the bowling alley's parking lot. not realizing that she meant pull into the second drive, i proceed to jerk it in the first drive. the tired squealed, so did i, and my mom is busting up laughing. then what do i see in the rear view mirror? the side of a car "OAKWOOD POLICE". frigging beautiful. but the nice police lady just asks if everything is okay and goes right along. maybe God was punishing me for not going to easter mass. who knows. i have a feeling i'll hear about that day at the 2023 easter dinner...   today i'm off to the mall with marcus liz and allison. should be fun.

      guys i need to apologize for totally not updating this thing. just slipped my mind. so much has happened, where do i start. since i'm staring right at it, i'll tell you about my new computer. it was much needed. we have a dvd player, cd burner, the whole shi-bang. very nice i might add. special thanks to the people at best buy except for the moron who tried to sell us everything short of a big screen. yesterday temporary insanity set in as i copied about 20 cds to my window's media player. this computer is fabulous... work started back up at hawthorne valley country club. kevin and i caddy up there on the weekends. that place is hooking me up with some well appreciated money. so far i haven't had any cheap golfers, let me tell you that's a rarity... officially bhs is on spring break today. after school liz (orchard for all who might not know because this is her first appearance in the web log) , tom, allison and myself went to arabica. chilled cafe mocha did hit the spot i must say. then tom and allison's relationship ended in bedford square. me and liz were just kind of talking, giving them some space. from the body language it was obvious to me what was watching but liz insisted he wasn't. guess who looked smart... then tonight i was suppose to go pick out a watch with my mom but that got shot down when she had to go watch my grandma. great. but oh well tomorrow we'll go and all will be well again. saturday tom is leaving for myrtle beach with the yusko's. and i am jealous. then tomorrow me and kevin are going golfing. i hope i do alright for the second time out this season... in english we finished the novel Animal Farm. a cute story about pigs renacting the russian revolution. not exactly my cup of tea but i made it through. we're now begining A Tale Of Two Cities, which i'm actually looking forward to reading. maybe it's because i did like the wishbone verision of it. whatever happened to that educated canine? maybe he was taking up clifford's spot on PBS and that big red dog wasn't having that.  wrapping up this renewal entry i'd like to give a shout out to veronica balough. i heard she actually reads this thing and it's ironic cause i read hers all the time (http://v-ron.blogspot.com).

      jeez, i'm great at keeping this thing up to date. where do i start, the last entry was almost a month ago. it seems like so much has happened since then. there's been a lot of drama recently but everything seems to be the way it should be now. like marcus and i had a falling out but we worked things out and its just the way it should be. liz and me had a short lived try as a couple but now we're just friends. stuff just seems like its back in place. schools almost out and i'm ready for summer and hangin out with my amigos. did you ever notice that after winter and towards summer everybody just starts being nicer to each other. its cool... being as this is my first year at bhs i'm genuinely (sp?) gonna miss a couple seniors. not many. but most will be back before too long so no worries. the group of freshmen coming up is quite depressing. the lack of any maturity in them is sad. our class knew not to act like fags and when its alright to joke, but its gonna be sad my sophmore year... oh man about a week ago me and kev were at jacob's field. we went to the upper deck and met some hilarious drunks. we got one of them to ask for the courtesy lady's number as the other was yelling "go get um slugger!" friggin cracking up still about a few of the things they said... this weekend is memorial day weekend, all that means to me (probably like most of my fellow americans) is a 3 free days. monday apparantly the orchards are having their annual blowout party at their house and everybody and their moms (lol allison) are coming. mrs orchard thinks i'm a shy, nice kid. somehow thats hilarious to me. maybe i should be an actor... its about 1 and i'm suppose to be up and fuctioning in about 5 hours so we'll keep this thing posted.

      this was a very summery day. like relaxin, swimmin, hanging with good friends. my kinda day. me and liz went up to the pool where we met jack and tom. then we all chilled in the nice cold water for most of the afternoon. i could feel all the eyes on my extremely sexy gut. the ladies were ooing and ahhing today. what can i say... so then after all that we went up to cyber pete's. which is suprisingly much sweeter than arabica. pool tables, just as many board games, air conditioning also and the stuff is a hell of a lot cheaper. being the pool shark that i am, i won a couple $ from jack. gggggggg-friggin-rrrrrrrrrr... today was very cool.

      old navy is da bomb for white people (this includes half white people such as myself). i got a ton of crap there for my myrtle beach trip coming up. the shopping bag was filled with lots of shirts, couple shorts, and some extremely snazzy trunks. they have blue hawaiin flower print and are a brighter shade of yellow. my mom then informed me that sharks are especially attracted to bright colors. great... but hey if the shark is close enough to see me, he's not gonna care what color i'm wearing. I AM NOT THE OTHER DARK MEAT! anyways today i talked to someone i haven't seen in a long while: colleen bojarski. in 7th grade we started talking like a month before she left to aurora schools. she was angie's friend and i thought she was hot. what else did you really care about in 7th grade? personality? sophistication? inner beauty? hell no, are you kiddin me. but yeah i saw her at bedford's world famous rib burn-off 2 weeks ago. but very cool deal... tomorrow i'm going to get my temps packet from the dmv. thats definitely sweet. on the otherside of that, driver's ed is starting for me in a couple weeks. 3 or 4 hours a week watching videos of people getting pulled out of accidents. yay! can't wait for that... so today as i was browsing through a myrtle beach golf magazine one of them caught my eye: "Myrtle Beach's most prestigous tee time awaits you at 'The Granddaddy.' From our fleet of  Rolls Royce  golf carts, to the starters clad in authentic Scottish kilts." rolls royce golf carts?! thats truly pimpin. i just got my mercedes benz scooter yesterday, complete with rims... i wish  well some good ole real world paris is on mtv. Adieu.

      school's out for summer. school's out forever... anyone else know that song by alice cooper? guess not... oh well. so if you haven't guessed it by now, bhs is closed down for a couple months. very cool stuff. as a result of oversleeping this morning and my moms graceful racing skills through the streets of suburbia, i made it to my first class with 20 seconds to spare. i've always been one for suspense. today on the schedule i had an english final, test on a tale of two cities (sorry ms. bambic it doesn't let me underline book titles on this thing), and another final in social studies. nothing excessively hard on the brain. today had some hilarious parts. everyone seemed to have water balloons. but out of seeing about 10 thrown i think i only saw 2 actually pop. as i was walking into social studies one of them skimmed off of me and exploded onto the guy next to me. lucky. then afterschool jack was running around with a supersoaker filled with piss. delicious. then dan wagner was telling me how andrew bahari got busted in the head with a hard boiled egg. maybe now i'll be able to tell who he's looking at when he's talking to me... so what was the first thing i did with this new found freedom? fell asleep of course. what else is could u possibly want to do.  then i woke up. it rained today. it rained a  lot  today. something like an inch and a half. now we have our own lake in the backyard. we're gonna bust out some canoes tomorrow and go fishin. yee haw. well its been a really tough day so i think i'll try to recooperate.

      lately it seems all of my choices are based on pure laziness. even with eating, this may actually work to my advantage, recently that refrigerator seems quite a distance away from wherever (sp?) i happen to be. this is still true when i'm sitting at the kitchen table. maybe some pounds will drop if i'm not up for the long journey to the food. maybe a new diet to sell.......??? this is how multi-millionaire businesses start people, pay attention. if this advice makes you rich remember who gave you this advice... there's a little more than a week left on the bedford public schools calender. that's very cool. one down, three to go. actually that's wishful thinking in this case. maybe i should say four(?) to go. two cheers for the 5 year plan. sadly this is not a joke for the majority in my school. higher education, yea!... yesterday i was contimplating what's gonna be on the schedule this summer. a little bit of work to pay the bills, some use of the six flags pass, without a doubt golf with the team, maybe a trip to myrtle beach for mom's birthday, and hopefully a couple concerts. speaking of concerts, did anyone happen to notice that xfest was sunday? i certainly did. yours truly came up with an actual plan that was gonna work. it was to get out of the house and go to the concert. but yeah most of my friends are poor so marcus was already going and that left me and liz with the $ to get tickets. we both thought hey its a concert and you gotta have a group to have some serious fun. as disappointed as i was not to go, i held true to that belief. no big whoop they'll be other shows. then i ended up listening to 92.3 most of the day. all they could talk about was how sweet the bands were. thoughts of what marcus might be doing at that exact time ran through my mind. naturally a state of depression came about me. then liz gives me a call 2 hours into the start of the show and says that she's listening to them talk about it too. she tells me that her mom can still take us but stubborn me has to stick to the group idea. "no liz that's alright." on top of that her tone led me to think it was half sarcastic. fast forward... i ended up going over her house. xfest kept coming up and i was just like i wish we would of gone. she agrees but then was reminded me of how her mom could of gotten us down there. dammit doug sometimes you're just an ass. loosely using "sometimes" in that last sentence... then today in 10th period study hall marcus and brenna are telling hilarious stories about people trying to crowd surf (you've seen it before people, where people jump and everyone else holds them up and moves them around. it was in the our lady peace video). and staind has some slower music and the crowd was just kinda like 'yea if you jump i'm not gonna catch you for these songs'. some people attempted to defy them. as they jumped and they then landed on the ground, the crowd was like 'yea i told you. you didn't believe me but i was serious.' some of these stories were hilarious. one of the kids from our school was in the mosh pit. still wearing her glasses (what are you thinkin??) gets completely elbowed in the mouth and end up crawling on the ground in search of her glasses. could we not have seen this coming? yeah i saw it coming too... well another decision about laziness is being made.   righttt................. now

      listen this whole sleep thing isn't exactly being comprehended by my body. i dunno but maybe i slept through the when to sleep class. is that possible? anybody with a good answer, give me a holler for 10 bonus points and a smiley sticker. but anywho the biological clock is set wrong but hey its summer. (that whole hey its summer seems to be the saying for the season and i am not one to argue.) man the past couple days have been rough to say the least. for starters liz is outta town and she's the one i talk to when i'm lonely, etc. so thats been a bummer. then i can't find my wallet. great... i didn't even have my money in it but i would definitely exchange a shitload of money for what was in there. my temps. fabulous work doug. just superb. now at least i'll have another month to wait after i busted my ass to get them the first day possible. still in search though, by wednesday the plan is to get the replacement. friggin yay. notice the lack of an explanation point. also not that i said "at the least i'll have another month" cause dearest mommy decides she's gotta start to lay down the law and that i'm gonna have to wait til i'm 18 to get my license. what kinda bull shit is that. this is when you decide to start teaching me discipline and responsiblity? its a little late and a little bit harsh for whatever the hell you're trying to do. i'm gonna be learning to drive when i'm leaving for college. a bijillion points deducted from the mother unit. maybe if i lost one of your precious vases or whatever moms collect i'd understand that you need to bring down the punishment but this is my own stuff and you can stay the hell outta it. not a chance that ur gonna be driving my ass to graduation. not a hope of a chance... we'll keep you updated on what goes down there. if there's a post on this thing 3 years from now saying, "i finally got my license." i'm definitely gonna be one pissed kid... now that thats done with let's look at the good side of life. which despite all of the above there is a lot of good things going down. liz came back tonight from columbus and i'm probably gonna be going to see her tomorrow. there's other people in bedford that need a stop by and say hi. so my buddy is back and thats very good. secondly, today i figured out that i won't have to pay for insurance if my mom really is serious. fuck work then for another 3 years. gotta look at the pro's and cons here people... lastly as i am shockingly losing energy, sam and me talked today and i realized how much i missed seeing her. it seems to be the start of something good, friendship or what not. she's a very sweet girl and we've both had our problems in the past. but the past is just that, the past. i'm excited about whats in store.   oh my, what was that...... i think you people call it a yawn. i would cheer for it but i'm afraid i'll wake myself up again.

      can you possibly think of anything more exciting than 3 hours in a stuffy little unairconditioned (sp?) room listening about people how have been thrown through windshields because they haven't worn their seatbelts? neither can i. driver's ed has gotta be the highlight of my teenage years. but yeah, i seem to be staying up later and later these past nights and that results in getting up later and later. today i woke up at 2. tomorrow the nightly news will probably be on the tube when i awake. after that who knows, maybe jay leno. but back to reality, there was a lot of loungin before driving school. then after i made my way over to the orchard house which seemed to be the spot for the night. there was liz and christine (of course, they live there anyway), then john, mitch, jason (other usuals), then my best buddy tom, kevin, mallory, allison, and my favoritest person in the world: michelle. :) oh yeah there was their danish foreign exchange student, meri, too. we kept asking about sweeden (i know that's not where danish people are from, thats the point). tom got her annoyed but doug was the only one who got her to flick him off. 2 hip hip hoorays for that. then we pissed off the fuzz. u know: the 5 0. the po po. as they were driving thru the intersection tom said "doug there's the police, shut up". what i heard was "doug there's the police, act drunk". so i did and that attracted their attention. after they had passed one came back after apparently hiding in the bushes and listening to our conversation. we got a warning. and u best believe ms. o wasn't having any of that. but oh well... then i got to see ms. randi "sex kitten" scibana. she drove me home. :) i missed her and her little boy too. i wanna wake up before sunset tomorrow so i'll keep you posted.

      not suprisingly this thing has been neglected once again, but hey life happens and stuff gets busy. its been about a day or so since i've been back from vacation. i went down to myrtle beach with liz and momma bear. it was cool and relaxing but i never found those lesbians tom was talking about. maybe next time. we did the parasailin, the tourist traps, and the beach... the usual suspects. it was a good week overall. the hotel room was dead sexy also. you'd be suprised how many drunk hicks there are @ 1 shootin off fireworks into the atlantic. right now ur reading the weblog of a guy who likes shoppin. i go to the mall til i was bankrupt, which ironically i am at the moment. donations are welcomed. after losing my second watch, i got another one while we were down there. it counts the seconds in chinese symbols. shouldn't be that much trouble for myself. if u've ever been in south carolina u'd definitely be aware of their love of the miniature golf. billions of $ in the putt putt business down there. smart cookies these southern people are. something i will definitely miss about the trip is the iced tea down there. it is loaded with sugar just the way i love it. if u get unsweetened tea, like liz, you are looked at as if you just dropped ur pants and rubbed ur business in someone's grandma's face. rock on to the iced tea... on the way back we made a stop in chapel hill, north carolina. home of the university of north carolina. home of the tarheels. they got a beautiful little town with a gorgeous campus. even though it rained u could tell this place was something special. we hit up a planetarium show about life in the universe. lemme tell you, the planetarium is my kinda of stuff. the whole awe of night sky and astronaut stuff has been with me since i was really little. definitely a little boy's dream of something out there. but before i get to misty, i'll say we made it home even after the air conditioning broke in the 100 degree heat. fun stuff. and by the way red roof in sucks. don't ever go there. go sleep on the side of the highway before u go to that friggin hotel chain. they didn't even have soap in the room, let alone a pool. sub par indeed kiddies... today was my mom's birthday. we had a nice little cook out at my gramps. but there are definitely some people in the household that are pricks, i'll leave it at that. tomorrow is gonna be a milestone. driver's ed starts up and boy am i pumped to be a cautious driver. two cheers for the jaws of life... well the real reason that i'm writing tonight is cause i've been pondering a lot lately. and i had to put these ideas on paper (or computer screen). ever feel like you shoulda been more outgoing at times, taking that chance. i'm sure there's been an occasion or two like that in your lifetime. well i've felt like that a couple of times recently. its easier to reget trying and getting a no, than wondering if u tried.."would you have got a yes?". so things are gonna change as far as outgoingness  . no more wondering about stuff, more finding out. and hey why not i'm 15 there's plenty of time for embarrassment and shame for me. why not test it out? all of this is starting tomorrow and if u'll be around me hopefully you'll notice. but yeah the new watch is showing some weird picture that looks like a dog humpin jesus, so i think its getting late.

      even though post are very, very, very rare on this thing i do try to make the most of the ones that actually get done. my computer was down for quite a while with that blasterworm virus. but what are ya gonna do? so as any kid from bedford knows (or really should be informed) school starts up again tuesday. not the best but i'm gonna venture to say its better than working at hawthorne valley country club... oh wait i still have to do that too. gayness. so yeah i'm in golf team. laugh it up but suprisingly the asian is doing alright this year. the team as a whole can't say the same.

      hey everyone its been like a week since i've touched this thing. i've been thinking about things lately and i didn't know if i wanted to put all of it in this thing. but now i have an idea of what i wanna say. recently a lotta stuff has been going on. most of its been really fun... by the way trapt is a sweet ass band. lemme tell ya. 3 days grace isn't too shabby either... but after the fun i'm usually wanting more excitement. and when there's not i get annoyed. real annoyed. people around me seem to have every compaint possible. maybe they do, honestly its probably me 75% of the time. especially i've discovered during the few times i've been drunk and such... after the buzz i usually get really really pissy. everybody sucks for the next 30 minutes. you will get bitched out if u are one of these people. but also thats when my best thinking happens. for those moments there is no longer an attempt to be a nice guy or to turn the other cheek for you religious people out there (which i have beef with you people, i duno if i'll tackle it in this entry.) but anyways when i'm really thinkin then i realize how shallow a lotta people are. then sometimes i just think about really depressing stuff. who knows...  don't really know how to make all this into a good mr rogers lesson or make these thoughts into something productive so i'm out.

      waking up early everyday has changed my daily routines quite a bit. for instance i actually can order from the breakfast menu at mcdonald's. dunno but for me its been a long time, i missed ya hash brown. also i'm actually up and about before the sun sets too. lemme tell ya, i'm about as perky as some college girls tits in an alaskan wet tee shirt contest. (o)(o)... on another subject, i've recently seen a lotta people that have been m.i.a.  such as kristen from snowboarding, who i am very happy to say i'm gonna be hanging out with a few times before bhs. also brian yuhas has been a recent fixture too. he's a pretty funny kid and i'll be seeing a lotta him with golf team... last night was supposeably the season premeire (sp?) of the greatest show ever, american dreams. well it was just a repeat of last year's first episode. a certain malaysian was pissed to say the least. but then liz called and we both were pissed so it was all good. we talked for a long time actually now that i think about it. well this entry has been pretty uninformative to say the least so i'll cut my losses.

      hey everyone. how are you? me? i'm spectacular as ever. i hope you are too. so this weekend hasn't been high energy but its a good weekend all the same. friday night there was the football game. bearcats 20-14 that always a good deal. lemme say there was some fabulous placeholding by mr. balough. so after words me and few people went picked up marcus who was gonna be a homebody for the night but i didn't let him. then we were suppose to go to this "party". well thats wat it was called up til monday. tuesday through friday it was called a bonfire/party. at the game a small bonfire and on the way there as a turential downpour occured a small get-together. greattt... like there were originally about 30 people coming. then at the game they told like 3 groups it was cancelled cause they didn't want "too many" people. well they certainly didn't have too many. we ended up with about 12. i mean it wasn't a bad night just not even close to expectations. like the 16 year old who was expecting a car but go a dirtbike. still good but not quite the original idea. anywho saturday i ended up with liz babysitting her cousins. wow little kids can be very amusing. wow little kids can be very tiring. especially when you are running with them across a busy 4 lane road screaming at the top of your lungs (yes i did say your lungs, not theirs). the house we babysat at had the most gorgeous big screen, high definition tv/love machine. woah... my god. so then we came back to the orchard house. there was christine, john, mitch, and keith. they were watching american beauty... they all look like zombies. so me, mitch, keith played some darts. i whooped ass of course. are u kidding me? so today me and my uncle cried as browns game looked like a prison film and we dropped the soap. then my favorite tv show in the history of mankind... american dreams had its season opener. with my best bud liz. i was a happy camper. so its getting late and the funnest thing in the world school is back in about 9 hours. score!

      so maybe its been a couple days since the last post.... alright more like 35 but who's counting. before i started typing this one up i was looking at the older ones. man i sound bitter. sorry about that to all who endured those post. i also sound like a substance abuser so sorry about that too. anywho turn a new leaf. school's definitely back in. i thought i knew what school was like during my freshman year. that thought is begining to change. if u are a freshman... DO NOT take honors chemistry with brewer. this guy loves homework and there's been about one whole day we haven't had that. can't wait until swim team starts (insert sarcasm). besides that life is pretty good/easy going. this weekend should have a couple of highlights. there's a party and i'll probably end up at the mall. 2 things that are never bad. so today i was walking home with liz and i heard about the funniest thing ever. she has a jewish lady for 10th period and she's like "this lady would be a nazi if she wasn't so jewish". i about cried. score 10 points for anti-semitism. on that note i'll catch up with this thing later. promise.

      wednesday, thursday, and friday of this week at bhs have been designated as days for slackers to finally pass their proficiency test. this means that everybody else that actually  did   pass their test the first time get to come in at the scandalous time of 9:20!! they throw us a bone every once and a while. i must say in that case i am one hungry man (i don't think thats gonna be as funny as i thought it would)... afterschool one of the sweetest things ever happened- matt hryb drove to tom's and picked me up in his 91' camaro. this means i now have a close friend that drives. (well amber will be driving again in a month. she would have still been driving now but what can i say? you just gotta watch out for those mini-vans.) but i was excited about that and i didn't have to go to swim team! i think the word i'm looking for is: cha-ching!... today was great when come to think about it...  yours truly also got like the coolest/nicest note ever. and what a shocker its from the coolest person ever, Amber. it perked me up so much this morning and that was massively needed. seriously i can't think of any bad things about the girl. she's that person who when i see her i can't help but smile. everybody should be able to have someone like that. liz said that she hopes we'll go out cause we'd make an "interesting couple". is that necessarily good? i'm not quite sure. it better be (insert the wannabe mean face of the white guy in "half baked").  to wrap it all up my day was awesome and you'd be lucky if yours was half as good.

      yesterday swimming conditioning started. my legs got really weak compared to last week cause today they hurt like a mutha... anyways the point of mentioning this is real practice starts november 7. that means i will be short on time for updating this regularly, but i will try my best.   i just read liz's blogspot and it was talking about there weekend. it sounded like she had fun. it also sounded like it was much needed so i'm happy for liz. lately and probably the near future has not looked bright for our friendship but if your reading this liz, we should make time.   so besides all that and swim team i've been with and it not with then talking on the phone with amber recently. a lot in fact (my cell phone bill can prove it. and the beatings from my mom because of the cell phone bill will prove it). its an incredibly awesome thing. she's definitely and rapidly becoming the coolest girl i've ever known. did you ever have someone that you love to be around but you really never expected they'd like to be around you? and then you are proven wrong when she says something nice about you. thats about the best thing to be wrong about, lemme tell you. before i start resembling something that should be aired on Lifetime, i'll just end in saying, i'm a happy guy.  thats about all thats going on in my world so we'll leave it there for tonight.

      so i didn't quite end up going to pennsylvania. but afterschool friday i did hang out with liz, christine, and mitch. it was alright, christine and mitch were already going at it. so i wasn't distraught about my decision not to go.  today is designated for getting the bulk of my chemistry report done before the due date: tuesday. i picked max planck as my scientist. he came up with solutions to the photoelectric effect, introduced the measurement of a quantum, and came up with the idea for the quantum theory. yeah thats all fine and dandy but i can explain it in about 1/2 a page and this report is suppose to be about 2. so what do u do in the extra one and half bare spot. beats me. if you know there will be a cash reward.   anyways enough of the boring school work. back to friday... after the kids made their depature for pennsylvania i went out for the night. amber, kelly, and some other people picked me up towards 8. we headed up to macedonia's theatre and ended up seeing scary movie 3 which was not School of Rock (would have been better. me and amber wanted to see school of rock but maybe another time). scary movie didn't turn out nearly as bad as i thought it would. there were a lot of weak jokes but once every five minutes there was a  hilarious  line. to anyone who isn't gonna spend their money to go see it... they were spoofing the famous scene from signs where mel gibson is getting ready to see his wife has been hit by a truck and about to die. well the guy who hit her yells at her husband, "i'm gonna need a ride home". jeez.  this weekend has been a movie weekend cause yesterday i saw "A Bronx Tale" for the second time cause amber has it. its a great movie with robert de niro and the gangster guy you see in the vanilla coke commercials (laugh it up but u know the one... with missy elliot). i think amber is the only person i know who has seen it. its so good though people. when we were watching the movie there was huge ass amount of lightning too.  anyways max planck is giving me that look again. you know the look.

      lately signs of ADD have been setting in with yours truly. nothing can really keep my attention, especially today. well correction, writing makes me concentrate. if anybody has some extra riddlen (sp?) pills you can make a phat buck around here... today a lot of people were annoying too. like everyone who knows my name thinks we're best friends. anybody who knows andrew bahari- that kid gave me a handshake today. i think my hand's gonna fall off now... split second reactions are a true test of character and loyalty. you know that moment where somebody's girlfriend gives you that look, either you give the look back or turn away and act like it doesn't happen. that moment where you can either go left to your old friends house or you can go right with your new friend to his. just little milliseconds where your reaction is automatic and after you realize thats who've you (or someone else) has become. and there's no changing it cause thats how you think and feel now. its weird when i pay attention to them cause they show stuff i don't really admit. it works.

      its about 8:40 do you know where you're virginity is? i sure as hell do, it stalks me night and day... so we made it through the hump day today. (this blogger is starting to have plenty of sexual inuendo) i guess thats good. two more to go. for some unexplainable reason mr. burnside had the snowboarding meeting today (october 22. little anxious buddy) and i guess it was kinda pointless. the large portion of the 15 minutes was spent waiting on emergency forms. exciting stuff. but afterschool we were all crazing a little bit of that digestive satisfaction (food) and went up to tom's house. that is except liz ( urlLink  ) who had some issues today but oh well. anyways we ordered up some delicious chinese food... what other country makes better food? everyone was funny for some reason so it was cool but i o.d'ed on that general tso's chicken. so we have a chem test tomorrow and angie wanted to study. i haven't hung out with her in forever. it was cool to see a new face (or rather old face since we used to hang out?). i was extremely tired so i fell asleep when she was researching online. but sleep is so good.  this weekend i'm suppose to go with the orchards, brian, mason, and mitch to pennsylvania. up until this week the enthusiasm was high for this event but recent events have shown that it might be a bust. the bare facts of the trip are we're going to a house from friday night to sunday afternoon, we're about an hour away from any stores, and the main entertainment is gonna be each other. the whole idea of non civilization bothers me just cause there will be nowhere i can walk off to if i get pissed off and stuff like that. then what if... and this is inevitable... someone gets into a fight on the car ride there and the whole weekend becomes in dire need of dr. phil to fix it all. then another guarantee is that there will be two or three groups divided the whole time. brian and liz (likely), mason and brian (probably), me and mitch (likely), liz and me (not so likely), and then christine. i can't really see where she'll extremely fit in so there gonna be some anger. just this weekend has a high chance of looking like a days of our lives.. ghetto style. but the possibilities if i stay home are to hang out with everyone thats won't be going... tom, angie, maybe amber, etc. and get a relaxing couple of days. worst comes to worst i end up playing video games and listening to billy talent. does that sound so bad?   whatever happens will happen, maybe i'm just looking for a reason to not go.

      somedays you just can't stop laughing from the minute you wake up. this week has been filled with them. recent weeks have really brought me down and made me a little bitter. but the weekend made up for those shitty days.... i already had a post about the interesting friday night. well saturday night was bhs homecoming dance. which is always a good deal. this year after many changes in plans, i did end up going and my date was amber godlewski (i had some fun learning that last name). we went with her brother mitch, my friend, and kelly, a senior friend of hers. mitch is always pretty funny and kelly though i'd never met her previously she did laugh a lot. audiences are always good, especially people who  do  laugh at my jokes! i don't care what you say momma :( ... i  am  funny!  well we thought we were showing up fashionably late by a half an hour. well maybe we just weren't fashionable enough cause it looked like the only people dancing were the kids that don't realize that they are the only ones there, the same ones who have imaginary friends named Melvin Munsen, professional ass whooper. anyways i'm getting away from the point of the night. eventually people started getting their groove thing/mojo on and with that the dance became "bumpin". i got to see and hang out with a lot of people that have been far removed from recent memory. and not because i don't like them its because of a lack of time to see all of them and other reasons like that. these people are those like angie, christine, mallory and kevin for a little while, and the list goes on... well if you've ever been to a bhs dance you'd be hard pressed to hear any song that isn't on 96.5 or 107.9 and this one was no exception. but i will admit that black people do know how to make music to dance to. (Outkast- I like the way you move) well for the past day and on the way to the dance all i heard about was how amber hasn't danced in like 3 years. as the night kept goin i realized this was a load of poop. she was a really sweet date though. so after the dance the 4 of us said bye to everyone and made our way to dinner. one problem... where would we be going for dinner? so after going to rockne's in solon, damon's in twinsburg, and a couple others we finally found applebee's in macedonia to be the only one open (except denny's which all of us are sick of). my date from last year, allison waple, was up there. i think she was trying to order a 1/2 pound or 1/3 pound of a burger (lol hilarious inside joke. ask if you need an explanation.) after i ordered a cowboy burger i was taunted with "yee haw" and "giddy up" by mitch. i must admit it was funny.   so that just about how my night went. good friends, awesome date, lucky guy.

      who ever said friday nights aren't interesting. cause last night was a holy jihad/hott damn of a night. all of this is told in my orginally titled book, Doug's Friday Night... a care free asian boy named doug sanders fell asleep when after dinner. as he slept peacefully before the night began he knew nothing of how his night would end. little did he know of the events that lay ahead for him. it all started when doug woke up around 7:15 pm. realizing the football game was in 15 minutes he made a crazed dash to the shower and like a mad man grabbed some clothes going out the door. when doug arrived to the bhs's infamous stadium he was met when applause and tears of joys. (i'm exaggerating but hey its my story) there the young stud saw all sorts of types... christine orchard, mason, roz, matt hryb, brian yuhas, tom scibana, liz orchard, chrissy g... the diversity of life in a nutshell (yeah i know thats not any black people and yea i said diversity. but white people at bedford is diversity). it was a frigid night but fitting for a bhs homecoming. doug stayed up in the stands freezing his tail off even with christine in an attempt to keep each other from hypothermia. they did not succeed and soon became human popsicles. at the half time homecoming king and queen were annonced. dan schroeter and not jackie hill. trying to cheer up jackie in the 3rd quarter, he allowed her to tap that big round asian ass. but since it was a homecoming game the bearcats lost with a close... 56-single digit :(. after the game doug made his way with danny wagner and a small group to cyber pete's (aka a warm place). as dan was ordering his famous hot cocoa of that night, liz recieved a distraught message from her sis christine. "matt got jumped... at carli's...." mixed in with a lot of crying. jump in the car run up there to get them. an array of ambulances and police cars with about 30 people lay before them as they drove to the house. through all the mess matt is okay. jack and andy are too. holly got hit in the face by one of the douche (sp? maybe i should ask ms. kozak) bags. big erin, the humugous 6'7 300 pound black guy is in the hospital. armond (potential broken rib) yelling at a cop that he's not going to the hospital. the explanation was 4 big drunk seniors drove up asked how the game was and proceeded to wail on matt. everyone jumps in, fill in the gaps. nobody was identified either. so after getting andy home dan and doug and again everybody back to cyber petes. where the kids finished that hot cocoa from before. then back to the orchards. where the night ended. the young doug made it back home and fell asleep around 2. just your average night.... how'd u guys like it? needs some editing. but wait that was just friday night. tonights the dance to. can't wait... stay warm and most importantly safe.

      honors chemistry is a beast of a class. its the reason i stayed up til 1 the past two nights and in turn not been able to update this thing. sorry people. but all the work hasn't been for nothing... 105% on that last test with a curve (i don't think its anything but luck the only reason i'd mention it is because when christine found out yesterday and i think grades get her "hot and bothered". yea i know its weird.)   well its been kinda busy around here lately. yesterday i was suppose to march in the homecoming parade for golf team. like the rest of the team i didn't show up. although i did see burnside in a hatchback with some bhs advertising and other administrators. can't feel too bad in that case... one thing that has been able to catch my attention is the boston/yankees series. i did miss game 2 but game 3 more than made up for it. don zimmerman is the old, old school rocky balboa. last night the sox pulled out a 9-6 win which made me dream a little easier. game 7 tonight at 8 for anyone left who doesn't know. don't miss it.   so in other bhs related news. homecoming is this saturday. woo hoo is the adjective for the weekend. it should be a good one. the last football game always brings out a good crowd provided no hurricane rolls through bedford. then saturday is the dance which always provides an entertaining night. when memories of last year's homecoming come back, man things have changed like 180 style. anyways my date is amber godlewski, also known as mitch's sister and the mini van wrecker. she's cool and a 90% of my friends are going now last minute. it'll be good. well thats about all for now. go sox.

      so the day was very shaky and eventful but in the end everything turned out the way it should. i guess. i was gonna go to the mall with liz today and spend some time cause i haven't really seen her much recently. last minute (literally) she couldn't go cause she had drivers ed at 6 and we would have been leaving at 4. :( that made me a little down. but i figured why waste the day so i called up mitch. trusty mitch, he came along and we had fun. man driving with your mom during rush hour is about the funniest/hassling thing ever. she was having a heart attack on ridge road but i kept in under control. apparently she didn't agree. but thats what parents are for. so me and mitch are pretty funny together. i got a nice black quiksilver hoodie, an american eagle dog tag, and a white billabong hat that was much needed. if you've seen my beat up north carolina hat you'd understand. then when we were going into denny's this old lady came up to us and needed money for the bus because her car broke down and her niece or someone was in critical condition. likely story huh? but my mom gave her $5 no biggie. later me and mitch start up the car and we see the same damn lady come from the same road. she saw us, started walking fast. it was extremely laughable. then we made a trip to christine's. she was babysitting. mrs. orchard gave me the baby boy who was very hansome. i think babies are the best. holding them makes me forget everything else. you know when they get that little smile and look. i hope i'll be a good dad. thats like the only thing i worry a lot about. before i end up in oprah's book club we'll move on. sorry about that folks.... after that we watched the yankess-red sox game. it was a good game. boston all the way. then liz came home. i saw her for a little bit. that was cool, its been a long while. back to how i said i guess things turned out the way it should. did you ever feel like no matter how hard you work at something it just wasn't meant? i think thats how it might be sometimes (i really wish it wasn't). lately, plans and the likewise seem to be a failure with a few people. like i went to hang out with marcus who said he never goes out and he was out that night. and the thing with liz today. it seems like thats how its worked out a lot lately. it sucks. really bad in fact. the people that i used to mean a lot to, feels like i'm taking a backseat. i thought they meant a lot to me too. should that change? i don't want it to. i don't really have an answer to that though. if you do, you are lucky and should be grateful. well i might as well get to bed cause 4 day weekends don't last forever. they last for about 4 days.

      what they say must be true. if you say i'm a nazi then you must be a jew.... just kidding. so bhs is out for a total of 4 days this weekend. count them: one, three, five, four. (see you can tell that its a bedford student)  i'm taking full advantage of the extra time but suprisingly not to catch up on studies. this weekend has been cool so far. nothing to complain about thats for sure. so thursday afterschool my buddy mitch and i meet up to see what the plans for the night are gonna be. by some random act of god angie, roz, and nick end up comign with us to target. these children much welcomed, especially the ones with boobs. (that means roz. lol maybe angie depends if i have my glasses on) anyways back to the story. after that angie and roz have their last jv volleyball game around 6 so we head back up to the high school. me and mitch schooled angie and roz at some "extreme" badmiton. and then we felt the burn in the weight room. for a skinny dude mitch has some strong legs. then the freshmen game started. i think in both of the games we scored about 6 points combined. and you're think don't you need 15 to win just one game? yea you are right. then the jv game was  slightly  better. angie and roz got distracted by our cheering but hey we're just trying to support the team. well we lost interest in the white ball going back and forth so we left. after that we walked around town and ended up watching identity with christine and john. then i had to leave. not incredibly exciting but it happens.    and then friday came. (i know this is getting long but this is probably the only time i'll get to write this weekend so i wanna cover most of it) i woke up around 12:30 which is always good. then i get a call from the hulk, otherwise known as mitch. mitch and his sister were heading up to the mall and her thunderbird has 4 seats so i'm invited. amy hurst ends up with us too. the more the merrier.  of course i left my wallet in my other pair of pants when i changed... pure genius. oh well it kept me from spending my money. after that we have to go to the bank before dinner. as we make a left on what we thought was a 1 lane road we get our tail light taken off by a mini-van. fa riggin abulous. well turns out it was a 2 lane road and amber's mom was not a happy person. but finally we got our starving asses to bob evans. it was pretty funny cause i'm decently good at making people nervous when i stare. amber cussed me out a couple times and then amy threatened not to pay for me. it didn't really stop me but she was nice and payed. after that we went to cyber pete's and then to christines with tom. that was a lot of fun but then us 3 guys came to my house.  man that was hilarious. we beat the crap out of tom. he kept talking about how he had to get up the next morning but we didn't care. let's see..... we flashed a strobe light in his eyes til he got a headache, then i sat on top of him and repeatedly punched him in the ribs, hit him with the butt end of a golf club, slapped him in the head to make him respond to us with "sir", and the classic shaving cream technique. he got it pretty bad but he was complaining. it all evened out. we finally left him to sleep in the living room at about 5:30. mitch and i were crying in laughter most of the time. tom was just crying. the next day at breakfast i was telling my mom the story and she was cracking up pretty good so you know it was funny. they left sometime in the afternoon and i caught up on some sleep.   anywho that was all the exciting, funny, and/or weird things that happened so far this weekend and this is by far the longest entry  EVER . to those that finished, you're diploma will be in the mail. i'm calling it and night. stay safe.

      i just read the last entry in this web log- geez there's about 5 spelling errors where you have to go... wait a second. sorry folks but in my defense i do go to bedford city schools. that explains it all doesn't it? i thought so. that entry was also very down and depressing. sorry to all those who actually read, but thats how it really was that week. but today was much better. lemme tell ya. after school my options were go on the bus, make up a lab in brewer's chem class, or walk somewhere. if you know me then you could guess that matt hryb got someone to walk home with on his way out of school. we made it to toms house because ms scibana was outside, and she was looking sexy as usual so we had to stop. oh yea tom was out there too. so we all got to talking and suddenly the subject of his little brother, eric comes up. it seems eric has "discovered" himself is a good way of putting it. (i apologize to the ladies that may be reading this...) and visiting sites like  tightcherries.com  good job kid. but it got a good laugh from everybody especially tom's mom. so then when eric comes home tom starts asking him if he's eaten any cherries lately. instantly the kid gets a shifty look on his faith but like a true bedford citizen never admits it. i'm laughing about it. so time passes and ms scibana's speaking of... there's some cherry jam in the fridge. we're like yay! cherries we love the cherrie jam. (again sorry to any black ladies that may be reading this) ms scibana corrects herself and says its black cherry jam. toms like "ewww. blackcherries... your sick mom".  it got a good laugh. anywho i'm out like the hosts of queer eye for the straight guy.

      as another week in oakwood/bedford passes, a young impressionable doug sanders looks to put a bullet in his brain. we've all had our boring, sucky day kinda weeks haven't we? well this week topped the charts like a friggin N Sync video on trl. this was the week of hatred and boredom, i think i heard the president declare something like that on tv, and well i'm very patriotic in that case. out of all the days friday had to be the best example of this frustration i've been feeling... we started out with the best of intentions (is it just me or does this sound like the start of a murder's diary?) anywho me and mitch decide we'll find somewhere to go and figure out the nights plans. well its cold and tom who has the closest house is in detention so the next best thing.... the orchard house. this might have been the worst mistake of the night cause both me and mitch had our problems with liz and christine respectively. but we decide we're gonna tell them and/or cuss them out, but we will be warm either way. so me and liz have our shit sling fight and i wait there with mitch until christine comes home. so we all go to dinner and mitch and christine go balls to the wall. but i had a divine omlet while this was going on so i was all good. but after all of that we went to back to their house. mrs. orchard with the best intentions attempts to teach us all a card game called Phase 10. whatever it'll take like 15 minutes and then we'll be gone. try 15 minutes per "phase" and u guess it... there's 10 phases!!! oh my lord. so after the second phase we book it to arabica. then after playing an exciting game of checkers we again head back to the house where there is about 15 people watching a movie. we join in but a few people were being loud so it was pointless. so then a few of them leave for mason's house cause his parents are outta town... okay but that included liz and christine so we are effictively outta of the house sitting on the front lawn. oh yay! well tom had called me earlier and i was gonna go over and sleep their. i call him.... oh there's no where to sleep so just go home. after saying a couple four letter words i catch a ride home and end the perfect friday night listening to 92.3. geez that was a whole lot of pointlessness and that was just the first day. i'm outta energy for all that typing and if you've made it this far then u deserve a reward. oh wait i forgot to mention i was dead broke all weekend too. which means no rewards my fault. i.o.u. hope ur day went better, night.

      so this will be the only real post of my Thanksgiving break. i haven't really had the urge to update this thing. not that nothing has been going on, just i wasn't sure how i'd like to portray whats going on in my life right now. so now we'll tackle some things that have been picking at my brain (however tiny it may be).   how was your holiday? mine really really sucked. well my aunt and uncle are getting married soon (not to each other, we aren't southern. southern little italy maybe) so they had their soon to be in-laws to have dinner with beforehand. this meant eating really late in comparison to normal family holidays. the entire family finally got together around 6 causing my grandpa and mom to become angered by the inconvenience. after the eating all those hostilities came out in full force resulting in a crying aunt and my grandfather pouting. just another sanders clan meal. but my night suprisingly was not a total loss. well i had invited amber to come along with me to this lovely dinner. smart me. somehow she was not completely phased by all this and hung out with me afterwards. that was about the best possible way my night could have ending, just being able to be with and talk to her was all i could wish for.   recently the effects of continuous change has been very prevalent in day to day life. it seems like a freakin blur. all the people around me are changing so quickly and i am no exception to this rule. i wouldn't say that we are growing up per say but we are all growing. at least i think that's what you'd call it. not that any of this is necessarily bad either. my life is really good right now but nothing is the same as it used to be a few short weeks ago. NOTHING AT ALL. some case examples would be:  -liz and everything that's going on in her life. that lazy kid i know has a job now! what the hell is happening. -tom used to be an easygoing, fun loving guy. seems like he's going through some bad times and i have no clue how to help him out... mitch was going through something similar but i think that's all passed.  -my relationship with amber is constantly evolving and getting stronger. 2 months ago i was just saying hello to the girl. it's been about a month from today that we've been dating. i haven't felt anything nearly this way about anyone ever.   ... and that's just how i see it.

      let's refresh our history and look to what douglas ian sanders' was thinking on november 4th by viewing his entry. there needs to be some amendments to this one folks. a small note, that whole thing about the 4.0 kinda blew up in my face. my little mention of getting an A in english turned out to be depressing irony. pathetic, eh? cutting to the chase, the whole thing about swim team. well i sorta quit that. but that should not be too much of a shock if we brush up on the entry of novembre (that's french for poop if you didn't know) 15th. to be honest, i really just lost my passion for swimming. i've be hearing everybody's opinion on this but in the end i'm settled with my decision. somewhere along the line it felt more like a chore than a sport. i'd rather spend time on something more enjoyable or productive. maybe a job? we'll see...   to the one thing that has not changed since november 4th: my endearment and fondness for the amber lynn godlewski (why do i keep saying full names? is this gonna be like other famous US history assassins such as Lee Harvey Oswlad, John Wilkes Booth, etc? who are amber and i going to murder... maybe that political mastermind, Ross Perot? woah way off track i know. sorry guys. ) but yeah that girl continues to make me smile. lately we've been exchanging notes that are saturated with romance and niceties. our written words are by far more eloquent then our phone conversations. what does this mean? maybe post card sex over phone sex. although i suspect the post card would be very short. maybe fitting. anyways, i'm just trying to say this she's a real special girl. i can only hope that i don't botch it up and can keep her fooled long enough to continue a relationship with me.

      when i was signing into my blog, i clicked on one of the fresh blogs (the most recently published ones) that was named No Milk Please. sounded like an interesting name. well its this gay guy talking about tragic stories of bisexuals and saying how tragic all this people are. wasn't exactly what i was expecting. maybe some girl who doesn't like milk cause she threw up in kindergarden after tasting some of that delicious cow juice. beats me...  last night it was my soon-to-be uncle's birthday which was cause for celebration. the fam went to this restaurant down in akron called the Thirsty Dog. yea i know it sounds like this might be the kinda place that serves drinks with toilet water in them but hey everything's worth a try once (i hope. lol). but it did have good food. amber braved the night with my family so kudos to her.    ... yeah i kinda lost my enthusiasm for writing at that point. i guess will be that mysterious episode in my blog. you know like on Happy Days where the Cunningham's brother suddenly disappered?

      if there's ever been a constant challenge in my high school life, it'd be my ability to keep my friendship with liz as good as it has been in past climaxes. this summer was so easy and simple. it's really hard to put into words how things were. liz and i were the best, closest friends there were. that's all there is to it. after school started things got to changing in a hurry. when her and brian started their relationship it felt kinda like tom and angie happening all over again. meaning i was about to get the boot. in my mind it was get off the ship unless you wanna sink with it. and ever since then things have turned out to be good with me. my friends became a lot more broad and diverse. i'm slowly becoming a kid who i can really respect. who knows...if all that drama wouldn't have happened then most likely i wouldn't have ever met amber. what i'm trying to say is my life is really enjoyable now but just not in the same form as a couple months ago... back to the point of all this blubbering. liz's blog mentioned an offhand comment that i made. something along the lines of "will we even be friends by then (a year)". it was just a random thought cause who would have thought this is how my life would be right now. honestly, i really couldn't see us not being friends. not just friends but the best of friends. no matter how busy our lives get i'll always have time for the kid. plain as day.

      today was just not a good mood kind of day. nothing major happened but everybody seemed incredibly attention hungry. no i don't really care about the boring weekend you had, really? he looked at you! unbelievable... that sort of stuff. after a decently challenging practice and nice long shower i'm in a better disposition. right now i'm listening to linkin park's hybrid theory. i just got it back after leaving a cd case at liz's aunts. so its all good. anyways i felt like tackling the issue of my beef with religion. really not meaning to offend anyone but this is how i feel...  let's start with an incident that stands out in the dusty old brain. last year in french II, ashley luke asked ms. morrell to tell me and marcus something. it was to refrain from using the word God/god in vain. that it was offending her. basically we were putting that sort of vulgar language in her face. well ashley wears shirts that says "Jesus-  Our   first, last, and only hope." sorry hun but when i tell you that he was my only hope?... the major thing that i consider a misconception is that if you aren't religious then your probably doing bad things. the reason religion is so popular is that its easy to say good Christians, Jews, etc are moral people. the core of their religion is based on a bunch of rules that for the most part are considered to be "good". but countless times i've heard sunday-attenders talk about how they had sex but it was love. sorry kid but that's not what you signed up for. it said no pre-marital sex. not oh he said he loved me sex. if your gonna put it in my face about how good you are then follow the rules. all of them... to wrap this up, for the most part it seems like brainwashing just like nazi germany was, radical political countries are, and the like. i don't see what the difference between ideas of cult practice and sabbath. do you really know the answer? to be frank, the Bible was probably written by a society rule conscious group of Arabians that lived about 2,000 years ago. good intentions do not always turn out the way they were planned. and i really do hope there's an after life where we see all our loved ones we've missed. be at peace with what's happened but i'm not putting all my eggs in that basket. live your life that happening now and worry about things as they come. and if there is a God he doesn't live in a musty old church and he's not looking at the attendance sheet of your church visits. he's looking at your heart and he lives in nature's beauty. think for yourself and you'll find your own answers.

      *have you seen how long A Tale of Two Cities is? Charles Dickens doesn't have anything on this kid*  saturday mornings after eating a well balanced breakfast of salsa and chips it seems to make me feel philosophical about life. i feel like putting my perspective about things happening recently on my blog. warning to all those who are pregnant, have trouble reading more than is on the menu at burger king, or are just are plain illiterate i have a feeling this is gonna be one of the longer post. that just eliminated about 80% of the bhs population. but now that we got rid of all the rift-raft we'll proceed with the demonstration. i'm gonna let my mind kinda wonder here but i'll keep an electric collar on it just in case it makes a break towards the cliff.  i'll start with yesterday because had a bunch of climaxes (high and low) that just gave perfect examples of all that has been bothering me and all that has been good lately. school was just another day but after i walked with liz to her house before practice. it was pretty funny the whole way there. we were being stupid and laughing hysterically like everytime we're together. i really miss that girl and all the fun times we've had. after that matt hryb picked me up and we went to practice. we worked out and had about a hour and a half of swimming. basically normal stuff. then we played water basketball in the deep end. everyone on that team hates someone else on the team. a couple people were getting mad cause some of the wannabe hard-core black kids were getting a little rough. girls were mad at each other cause of the same reasons. just a lotta built up tension was being let out. then there was about 20 minutes of hissy fit arguing in the showers about the score. i got pissed from then on cause these people aren't gonna care this much when we lose a meet. then coach wouldn't give me an answer on what all of us "snow bunnies" (best word that came to mind, sorry people) should do about snowboarding since a lot of our meets are on the same days as ski club goes. i got real heated about those last two things. its been a week into practice and i'm already sick of most of these people. but finally after all that drama i made it over to amber's. that's what kept the gun out of my mouth last night. we watched some tv and made hot cocoa. we were suppose to have popcorn but amber struggled to keep from burning them. it was funny though. that girl really does make me happy and completely forget about unpleasant days. it was good time spent with amber even though mrs. godlewski (her mom) makes me the slightest bit uncomfortable in some conversations. on the otherhand mitch was extremely depressed all night. the kid is usually in a joking mood and funny. he just wasn't having it last night. i suppose its because he used to be so close to christine and me but those two had a major falling out and naturally i have been with amber more. he cut off his mohawk, too. for his sake i hope he finds someone that makes him happy and pronto.   so that kinda turned into a normal (but longer) blog about friday night with my explainations for why everything happened. hold the phone though, there's still some stuff that needs to be put down in this log. i need this stuff to be put down so i can see it visualy. they say people are more like to accomplish things/goals if they write them down. let's see if those genius's are right... i know this one is long but just butch up nancy. (inside joke)  -a fork in the road really seems to be presenting it self to my attention. if there is one thing i enjoy more than anything, it would be snowboarding. ever since 7th grade its been something i really loved doing, no matter how mediocre my ability is. last year was a lot of fun and there really hasn't been any times out there where i haven't laughed continuously with my friends. also i alluded earlier about the conflict of the swim team schedule preventing me from going with ski club this year. as much as used to love swim team and the competition, this year has not been even nearly as enjoyable. everybody seems to have there opinion on what i should do yet ironically i have no clear idea on what i feel. this weekend will see a lot of serious thinking about the subject.   -the people that i spend time with regularly has changed so much in the past couple weeks. even though i absolutely love the people i'm with now, i really miss those other people. tom is a really good friend but its been ages since we've just hung out. yesterdays walk with liz really brought up fond memories. but then there's some things i really am happy have changed and don't regret for one second. marcus used to be my best guy friend but it never seemed like he was going to grow up. it never seemed to be his fault when we were pissed at each other. that kid was really funny and i liked being around him in good times. but when things weren't go so good, watch out. the hardest friend i ever tried to keep. another thing that changed for the better is i stopped trying to fit in with the whole jack-armond crowd. those kids just don't have any depth to them. even when tom tries to, they've stood him up plenty of times. it wasn't my thing, i guess.   -so much is going to change for me before i graduate high school. even before i finish this year. it's kinda scary when you realize something like that. 3 years from now i'll be at some college trying to survive freshman year. 2 years from now i'll be a senior and my friends like liz, mitch, etc will be away at their college. just next year i'll driving which is good. but amber will be gone. actually she'll be going to a school for chiropractors but probably have her own house around bedford. that'd be awesome. but then like there's always the chance that something will happen and we won't be still friends or anything. the possibilities (good and bad) are endless. jeez it's crazy.   well i'm pooped out from all this thinking and you should be a marathon runner if you read all of this insane stuff. i can smell my mom's brownies so i'll keep you posted as more situations develop.

      suprisingly i got my homework done in school so a couple refreshingly free hours came about tonight. the plan is to take full advantage as recently this relaxation has become rare. after some chinese leftovers and a nice hot shower we're off to a good start. now if i could find my stash of sports illustrated swimsuit issues we could get things off and running... so this week has been busy to say the least. swim team had a couple practices and trips to the weightroom. i got voted a captain yesterday. now i'm officially a swim team captain on a boys team of roughly 10. woo hoo. today we had time trials. my 50 free was about where i expected but my 100 time got bigger like a chick who moved next to dairy queen over the summer.  hopefully you got the picture (maybe hopefully you didn't). so lemme leave with a couple random thoughts...  -take dedication seriously no matter what the situation or thing your dedicating yourself to is. decide if its worth it. don't half-ass anything.  -why is chinese food so good? because asian people make it. it's kinda like nike shoes.  -i haven't talked to my girlfriend much today. thats shabby. she's getting a call soon. -did you ever think your life might be one big hoax on you. like the Truman Show or something like that? -asian kids smell funny.

      from this day on life gets busy. real busy. we had swim practice today. although i did alright, i just realized how many hours that will pass as i'm going back and for in that pool. it just seems kinda pointless at this point. yeah i know i sound like major pussy right now. sorry people. but desperation is a good adjective in any event. then on top of that i found out snowboarding is on tuesdays. in january we have like all meets on tuesdays. seriously what's a guy to do? my religious friends might say, "God works in mysterious ways". i think he's just got a sick sense of humor... so liz was saying that it seems like everybody is hooking up. thats a really good observation. the only reasoning i can think of is that playboy subscriptions got canceled or something of that nature... so i'm not a big fan of making announcements about my day to day life. today i had about 5 people become shocked that i didn't tell them about my relationship with amber. am i suppose to wear a tee-shirt notifying everyone? (sarcastically amber suggested that we would. i think i might have to embarrass her by carrying that idea out.) don't get me wrong, i am exstatically happy that she is my girlfriend. just the whole everybody knowing thing is weird. cause then somebody always has to be up in ur business like "did you know amber was talking to so and so after 5th period?"   and through all this i'm extremely excited about tonight. amber and i are going bowling with some of her friends and possibly one or two of mine. the only part of that sentence that matters to me was: amber and i. even though we have talked on the phone for about... hold on checking the minutes... 1481 minutes (not including peak minutes) the past two weeks i haven't really been able to see her out of school. thats just no good. its gonna be an awesome night. hope yours is too. i'm out.

      if your interested in staying under water while doing aerobic exercises for 3+ hours a day, swim team's first mandatory practice is friday. aren't you excited? actually i am because i need to get back in shape. plus matt hryb and nikki gaitlin are decently funny kids... did you hear about the hot asian guy who got a 4.0 1st quarter this year? cause i did. who woulda thunk it (yeah i got an A in english, what are you gonna do about it) maybe amber is rubbing off on me, figuratively i mean not physically you pervs (well maybe just a little bit. don't tell her i said that). but now that amber's name has been brought up: we've been officially going out since friday. the last post really didn't give any mention cause i wanted to be in a happier state of mind then i was. but now everything is good. once again the guy who buys one ticket a year wins the jackpot. did you see the nice sentimental nostalgia there? :) but to sum it all up halloween seemed like valentine's day this year. see that sentiment again!? this kid's a natural romantic... mom's kickin me off so i'll keep you posted.

      life's changed drastically and all the sudden its hitting me like a ton of bricks. tonight there was a halloween party at my aunts and i needed someone to go with me. i asked mitch and liz. liz sounded decently into the idea of seeing me but then the all to familiar change in plans happened again. but trusty mitch and i made it bearable. we caught up on things. after we went over to liz and christine's cause it was still pretty early. amber, i thought, was out for the night with a friend. there was a lot of fighting between the parental units and offspring. not the most inviting atmosphere but they ended up getting chinese food so all was forgiven. after that we went upstairs cause everyone was tired and liz had to clean. then mitch seemed to be complaining a lot to i kept seeing how far til he actually stood up. never happened. but liz sure did and that was another interesting fight. its so friggin predictable everytime we get together anymore. so gay too. i just went home really pissed. then i got a call from amber which got my mind off things. she didn't even go with her friends that night. i would of been such a happier guy to just have been with her tonight. but that isn't how my night was. all i want is to be able to drive over and just talk to amber. thats all i could possibly want right now.

      at 3:50 most would expect a person to be "fast" asleep. such is not the case so i might as well take this time to update. things change a lot in two days around these parts...  in reading various blogs i get the feeling many people are hesitant to admit something plain sucked or their day flat out blew. they try way too hard to be philosophical. honesty combined with the ability to show the least bit of vulnerability goes a long way in my book. seriously, just now is all too perfect of an example. my cat apparently got a little sick and my foot discovered evidence of this. i mean because i got the cat puke on me now i'm probably more aware of my surroundings but hey i'd rather of discovered it in some other fashion. now i'll learn how to clean and handle this situation if it happened again: no not really cause i'm going to leave it there for my mom to take care of in the morning. anyways when it gets down to it, some people try to show their "intelligence" by talking in some far to complicated for my small brain to comprehend way in a horrible attempt to sound sophisticated. this really gets boring because in most cases its some sort of cover up (either from a lack of real things to talk about, trying to show some non-existing importance in something undeserving, etc).   but on to better things... christmas wasn't half as bad as previously thought. the honey baked ham settles well while listening to your brand new mp3 player. the family was in pretty good spirits avoiding the confrontation family events i've become accustomed to. plus gift cards let you know that you'll be making trips to glorious malls. the only thing detracting from my holiday was a runny nose and other symtops of illness. christmas sleep makes everything better though.   today, rather friday was one of the best days i've spent in a while. it was amber's birthday so i had to something special planned (which sounds like a rarity with her descriptions of december 26s past). well everything good happened... we got time alone, went to the mall with katie and kelly (funny kids), and the planned birthday suprise dinner at the Amazon Trail. in the process i discovered dvd's in one's bag trigger store alarms. fellow shoppers found this quite amusing. but for god sakes i ate real alligator tonight! how bad could my night has possibly been? it was an awesome day to spend with a pretty girl. warning to all, forest gump is not your friend at pac sun!  with all this to digest, including my reptilian appetizer, finally settled i'm off to slumber. we'll keep ya posted.

      for all of you waiting in suspense since the last post... i did see willy wonka last night. not quite all by my lonesome self but in the presense of beautious company. amber to be exact. i mean not many pretty people let me hang out with them without some monetary compensation. it was a nice evening though. mitch actually left the house for a few hours. a rarity. from his mood when he got home i'd say he might of actually enjoyed himself in the process. good change of pace i guess... well hopefully this isn't true for the rest of you but my day basically bit the bullet. a cold or some form of disease happily seems to be finding room and board in my body. chills combined with a stuffy nose aren't exactly invitation for partying. lack of energy gave an excuse for my laziness (which regardless would have happened) probably my favorite senior citizen neighbor left for california earlier. not before my other insane neighbor cussed her out about not saying good bye. i mean she's elderly and doesn't like good byes. my mom, who i'm very proud of, yelled at the mental hospital escapie eventually stopping the birage of obsenities. when it all ended i contacted amber to see if plans tonight with tom, kelly, and other possible people to catch a movie were still a go. kelly went missing causing the death of a social life tonight. maybe we'll try it again sometime soon... anyways i've been kinda bummed lately upon learning my family isn't even getting together for christmas eve. seriously pathetic from my point of view. it's the holidays make a point to see each other under happy circumstances. the rest of my relatives do not seem to share the same ideas though. oh well i'll be away at college soon enough. talking with amber really got my mind off the subject to much better ones. i'm really glad there's someone who can do that. if not i'd probably be moping around, being gay. the feeling of no worries is splendid when she's around or on the other end of the phone. at the risk of sounding weird, it's just a comforting thought.   did you ever watch SNL and see those deep thoughts by Jack Handey? good stuff... Deep Thoughts by Jack Handey  #416: One day Dad asked me to go fishing with him. I got scared. I had the feeling he was going to try to drown me. I don't know why I thought that, because so far he had never tried to kill me. But he had never taken me fishing either, so I was suspicious. When we got to the lake, he walked right up to it. "Hey, son, come here," he said. "Look at these minnows." "Nice try, Dad - if that's your real name!" I yelled. Then I ran back to the  car  and locked myself in. Dad never took me fishing again. So I think that proves my case.

      well my ideas for spending the night have been put on hold (canceled?) at the moment. due to the absense of friends able to be contacted, at least those which i will admit to knowing in public. kinda depressing but worst case scenario i'll be wrapping up presents for christmas while watching willy wonka and the chocolate factory. for those of you that were wondering, that's not too bad of a way to spend time in my book... for some odd reason i had a dentist's appointment today at the peculiar hour of 9(15) AM. they decided i was old enough to try the "adult" cleaning process with baking soda and water pressure. a combination of taste able to wake a hibernating bear from his slumber. then, i was on to get a haircut at the infamous Bobby's Barber Shop (i say infamous because kevin balough goes there. it's gotta be famous.) now you would think i prefer getting seated by bobby because for god's sake he owns the place; also i'm related to the guy somehow. but this is not the case. this guy named john is just a beast with the scissors. he's going to be in the knew And1 mixtape of barbers. insane. to wrap up a non procrassinator's morning i went to giant eagle to cash in a cool $64 dollars in unwrapped coins. i must say though all this before 1 o'clock tires a kid out. can you guess what i did til 5? no not that you pervert...   anyways i'm going to start whatever i'm doing tonight. best of luck with your night.

      well for anyone who endured my hysteria while reading my last blog... everything has taken a turn for the best. on thursday i got a call from amber after school and she was doing good all things considered. resourcefulness payed off when mitch and his mom took me to the hospital with them. however my procrassination left me with no time to get flowers before they picked me up. we'll try to fix that debacle with christmas coming up. everything seems to be making 100% improvements, always welcomed here. all this brought a long withdrawn feeling of relief. normally i would apologize for such an angry post but i'm not going to cause hey it's my blog and what i'm feeling...   anyways on to more day to day events: yesterday was the last day of school before winter break. nothing too challenging except watching Pirates of the Caribbean. although with my attention span i probably failed. then after lunch the kid who's never been to TAP (BHS's dungeon for those who dare to be tardy) played escape artist with mitch and liz. where do two juniors and a sophmore without a car go? arabica of course. we all had a prolonged 3 hour game of monopoly filled with treachery and deciet. except for a trip to burger king, sleep, and some phone time that was pretty much my friday. exciting huh?

      alright so there's something really urgent and important which i need to get off my chest before i explode. this post is one i really don't want to discuss with anyone but it has to be expressed by yours truly. tomorrow morning amber has to have surgery at the cleveland clinic. there's some mysterious bump or growth would be the best word to describe it, on her thyroid glad. not ever the doctors know what exactly this is. they say it could be nothing or it could be something as serious as cancer. they may have to remove parts of her thyroid gland (maybe the whole thing) and there's an outside chance they have to mess with her vocal chords. i mean seriously what the fuck happened here that i missed. why the hell does amber have to go through this shit and not some other bum sucking up oxygen. she's going to be 18 next week these are not the things anyone should have to worry about.  i don't understand!  for the past week we've known the date we've kinda just focused on the good things in life. whenever i see she has that scared look it cuts me up so bad. i'd do anything to protect her from the pain and the worry. i try to make her laugh and forget. it seems to work but none of it can keep her mind away from the problems. i know this too. i see the way her eyes well up when somebody asks, the way she gets upset as she goes into detail. i fucking can't stand any of it. she's the only person i haven't had to go through major drama with. she makes me happier than i've ever been in a long time.  why her?  i guess is the question bothering me the most. amber doesn't deserve one damn once of frustation which is being brought about from the surgery. i hate this all so much. can't anything good just be left alone. i try to stay strong around her cause if i break then she will too. i'm so scared with all of this. i feel like i'm gonna snap any second. i'm gonna snap right now. i've never cared about anyone like this before and it gets pissed on. we're fucking been going out for 6 weeks and a load of shit gets dropped on. i'm not mature enough to deal with this. i'm so damn young. alright say worst case scenario it is cancer and its spread to her vocal cords so they have to cut them. can you fucking imagine loosing your voice ever. she doesn't graduate for another 6 months. i hate the hurt and worry i know she has. i hate the hurt and worry i feel. tomorrow i promised i'd go down to see her and my mom now revokes that because she'd have to drive back to cleveland. thats fucking ridiculous. i wanted to lashout and hurt something. to make her feel some of the pain i have. but i couldn't because she's my mom and she's of course, right. i'm sorry to inconvience you. my apologies. while your at it fuck yourself. i hate the bullshit facade of caring you seem to put on. i'm sorry your life is hard and trying. really i don't know what problems are like. how ignorant i am to pain. how simple i must be. god i hate this so much. i hate the hopelessness i feel. what can i possibly do to change any of this. you know what i did today? i told that girl i loved her. and i really meant that more than i could put into words. it shouldn't be under these circumstances. it shouldn't be this way. i hate the way i feel right now. i hate this so much.

      well my computer kind of sucks big time hence the lack of posts. since my hands are tied with the quantity will make an effort at quality... this second weekend of december had its fair share of hilarious, good, etc. moments. earlier in the week it was katie's birthday so friday night she had a quaint get together at her house. she's got a sweet room too. there's like two sides to it one being the sleeping quarters and the other the "living" space. and she has a damn christmas tree in there! how can you really top that? when we (kelly, amber, kevin, and myself) got there i must say the party looked a little lackluster to say the least. letty, katie, erin hoyt, and simone were just lounging. not even putting effort into this action. about a half an hour after our arrival the wheels started turning. i suspect this happened when the homemade ice cream chocolate peanut heaven on earth took effect. eventually we all had a most interesting conversation with some hilarious comments from letty... saturday wasn't too eventful but i did go to amber's. everybody at the house was either sick or occupied with other things leaving us to be. a nice quiet saturday night... sunday was a polar opposite with a list of things to get done. bright and early at ten is exactly the time when i want to be doing incars. my instructor guy was cool though. now i'm all done with drivers ed so yippie! in about 5 or 6 weeks i "should" have my license. after driving i was off to christine's to do some chemistry. it was productive. then my mom picked me up for dinner at the grandfather's. italian's know how to make some damn good chicken parmesgian (sp?). his apple crisp was not too shabby either. we went to beachwood mall and this outdoor malll called Legacy village. man it was nice. the sidewalks are heated and its set up like a small 1920s or 30s town. definitely worth the trip. finally i made it home around 6 but the night had saved it's best for last. amber came over in the hopes we would watch american dreams. for another consecutive week nbc has decided not to have the show on. and they are frankly retarded. if you hear about some television executives being held hostage by an asian, don't be suprised. as i was flipping through the channels in my frustration comedy central came through in the clutch. did anybody else catch a glipse of the Hebrew Hammer? friggin hilarious. it had amber and i cracking up a lot. amber was a great companion on sunday night as usualy. of course making me smile and in good spirits. an ability which has been dwindled down which only few seem to have anymore. but one is enough for me. anyways this has been long enough to outlast one of the Never Ending Tale movies so i'll keep ya posted.

      please don't think i am purposefully neglecting to update my blog at regular intervals. i am making efforts, however fulite they may be. last night two separate attempts to complete an entry were vanquished by my openly gay computer. i, being ever persevering, soon gave up. oh well. since my monday hasn't been too eventful, i think maybe the ideas of that blog will be incorporated into this one... so my weekend was very unproductive but still very enjoyable. on friday, i went to the godlewski residence to see my pretty girlfriend and watch her mom over eagerly show us various gifts she had bought for christmas. her mom is really nice to me though which is always appreciated. we made hot cocoa, watched tv, talked, got some much appreciated kisses-> it made for a good night. then on saturday i tackled the task of getting everyone christmas presents. liz and i (christine off and on) journeyed though parmatown mall purchasing things. i must say i think i picked out some thoughtful gifts but maybe that will only be  my  opinion. (insert uncertain face). after four hours of doing laps from store to store we were all tired making for a quiet ride home. i could not just let my day finish there so then amber came over to my house this time. we saw this mtv show called Blink 182- Album Launch. it was a really sweet show because they basically taped the band making their new cd and show all the work that went into it. it was very interesting i must say, amber had a similar take on it. suprisingly you can find some decent shows on saturday night such as southpark and this comedy central special on richard pryor. he's the guy from bruster's millions where he just inherited a bunch of money but has to spend so much before he can recieve the inheritance. man mr. pryor was a hilarious guy and knew what he was doing when deciding his career. most importantly it was good to finally be alone with amber without a crowd of people, an annoying brother, and the like. i really am a happy guy whenever she's around not my usual puppy kicker self. then on sunday christine and i were suppose to tackle some chemistry. it did not quite work out that way though. we started having a long conversation on a broad range of topics with her older sister included. it provoked some actual thinking. about 4 hours and one delicious chocolate mocha later we started that homework. yesterday was laziness out the booty but hey it happens. also last night i talked on the phone with amber for a while. made a nice mood to fall asleep during.... but hey that was my weekend. it might not be most people's idea of a great time but those people are losers. i'm done for now but we'll keep ya updated.

      sorry people i haven't really been keeping this thing posted to well, but as always, life just doesn't miss a beat. are things going well for you? i do hope they are. that's so kind of you to ask... why yes they are. life is really, truly great right now. anyways now that you're creeped out by my multiple personalities and eccentricities let's get down to business.  if it hasn't already been brought to your attention while reading my previous entries, i have been feeling a lot of uncertainty overall. this being the reason for all my generalizations. and its not bad uncertainty. more like when you meet a new friend and you're excited because you know that you're gonna learn all this new things about them. that's the best way i can describe it. this applies to a lot of areas for myself. i'm beginning to rekindle dimished friendships with people like mitch and liz. i think earlier in the year i was spreading myself thin as far as people i was giving my attention to. this made for a lot of "hallway" friends which would be the way i'd describe them. you know the people you can say hi to during school and abbreviated encounters. if you ever were together outside of school it wouldn't be the most exciting experience of your adolescence. lately, i've been just paying attention to people i find important to me and just focusing on them. it works a lot better, for me at least... another reason for the generalizations is i'm kinda apprehensive about putting in stuff about an extremely important thing going for me, my relationship with amber. i'm reluctant because my incessant gushing over the girl may becoming sickening to whoever reads this. also, i just don't think everybody should be knowing the details. most of what i want to say is really personal so i feel like only myself and the person my feelings are for should share these things.

      well i must say i've had quite a long and leisurely weekend. six days have seen me enjoying this rare freedom but you won't find me complaining because education of course comes second to snowboarding and video games. bedford has called two days off in a row, this all coming after a four year absence of any snowdays. what were the odds of that? but anywho...   like i said i've had a high quality weekend, i'm assuming (maybe wrongly) that if you know me enough to be reading this blog then you've probably seen me at some point since thursday. trying to stick to the highlights: friday i spent the day quite happily with amber eventually ended up at katie's with the likes of kevin. finally watching american wedding and eating some fabulous confectionary treat katie made, chex mix with chocolate and peanut butter covered with powdered sugar, in a word, jeez. then saturday i watched saving private ryan for the millionth time with amber who was a first-timer (virgin). it was a well spent evening. then sunday mitch slept over because monday was ski club's trip to holiday valley. 8 hours on a bus does make one tire but the journey was worth the reward. tom and i discovered the fun of zig-zagging between the forest trees both trying not to become the next sonny bono. the whole trip was just phenomenal...   tomorrow is january 29th which is exactly six months ago from when i got my temps. (for the second time actually. kinda lost my first ones with the rest of my wallet.) and the ohio state government has slipped up again by letting me get my driver's license. suckers. all of this is on the condition i pass the test tomorrow but i don't expect any trouble. keep small children and animals off the sidewalks, let alone the streets. this emancipation has been long awaited and i'm going to revel in it's glory.   as you can see i've had a rough past couple days so i think i'm going to recuperate from all the trauma... Skool fo Foolz!

      15 days later and here i am again, typing away like a hamster on speed. amazing isn't it? as the calender says it's tuesday, i enthusiastically went snowboarding with some bhs comardes. tom was MIA so mason, john, and justin kept me entertained for the evening. finally a chapter in my stellar, groundbreaking career i got my black diamond sticker today. also, i landed some jumps for a change instead of feeling their incline on my back. quite a lovely change of pace. the holiday valley trip is monday and the anticipation is high as bob marley right now. this year during snowboarding i've missed people like kristen and nikki who always seem to provide the laughs. they'll be accompanying the rest of us on monday. the trips will be cool to say at a minimum...   midterms are this week at bhs and you might be asking yourself: why is this fool on the computer and not studying? good question and if i had a justifiable answer i'd tell you. but honestly i've actually payed attention this quarter making me confident about testing. maybe this is misplaced confidence but confidence none the less. if you see me begging for change on northfield then you know how i did...   a recent upstart of many new blogs from people whom i don't often see but still enjoy has kept me an interested reader tonight. katie and letty have decided to try their hand at online journals. two cheers for them. katie's perspective is very likeable and i might say the same about letty's but i have no idea how to spell her address name. maybe i need to take Spanish III or something. (just kidding letty please don't kill me.)   it's been a fun yet notably long day so i think i'm packing it in. night everyone.

      well hello there. long time, no type. i haven't been purposefully neglecting this thing just things have been hectic lately. but that's life so we'll suck it up. where shall i begin. although these aren't my favorite, i think i must address a "response" section of my blog for christine's most recent post.   let me give you the rundown: well my lunch table consists of incredible people like mitch, liz, nick, christine, and of course... me. i was saying something to liz and then in the backround christine finishing some comment "... with Amber" or something of that effect. so it didn't sound positive and i followed up with the usual "You're gay." basically in her blog she said she gets mad when she is immediately attacked by yours truly, she shouldn't have to censor herself around me, she shouldn't feel degraded, you getting the picture yet?... here's my reasoning. i mean as far as people me and christine are opposites in almost every aspect of life. you'll have that in high school and it's cool if you let it be.  as far as being defenisive about amber, yeah i am to an extent but moreso (sp?) around some people than others. why? because christine isn't friends with amber and/or doesn't know her like that so when christine says a joke involving her sound stupid to me. it's one of those: you don't even know so shut up about the subject. christine seems to get easily offended by my actions but this seems weird. when she's around mitch she'll constantly call him gay and cut him off so i don't think should be totally critical of my actions. and really i'm not trying to totally degrade her either just i'll say what comes to mind. if a certain comment was gay then expect to know it. christine of all people should know because having plenty of classes with her, i call her gay all the time. it's how i act i guess.   sorry guys that drew out a little longer than i hoped. but it's done so i'm leaving it.   i've begun to take notice my selection of friends i have (and want to keep) has dwindled drastically since freshmen year. although the quantity is going down i believe the quality has risen. maybe i'm just becoming grumpy. consequently i don't put up with as much as i used to. and therefore, my group of trusted friends becomes limited. i think all this is probably the reason for my recent differences with liz. we've talked about these changes a great deal too. i'm not sure we came to any tangible conclusion though. i think we are heading in two different directions and neither one of us is about to compromise. hopefully something will happen however doubtful i am.   as this post grows in word count, so does the amount of negativity. nevertheless i don't think i feel nearly as pessimistic as this writing my portray. on to some things i'm looking forward to enjoying.  ~two weeks from tomorrow i will be taking my driving test and if i pass it will be incredible. there's so many places i'm eagerly waiting to go. i'm predicting things will be so much easier without having to combat my mom's laziness to transport me. i can't wait.   ~this weekend. a plethora of schoolwork, snowboarding, and other things has been assaulting my schedule lately.  finally i feel that i'm on top of everything and can relax. friday when that bell signals freedom for 3 days i won't know what to do first.   ~the ski club trip to NY's holiday valley resort. it was a highlight last year and seems to be shaping up for a repeat. a whole day of snowboarding and messing around on the bus with your friends is smile-worthy.  an hour later and look how far we've come. it's been fun. in the immortal words of the great PTI host Tony Kornheiser: we'll try to do better the next time...

      with the first day back at the infamous bhs came a predictably casual day. i guess teachers are people too. at least that's what mr. morell (the french teacher) whales in frustration when she begins to feel threatened by the thugs attending my high school... as i realize how the current week is going to shape up as far as an agenda goes, i'm afraid to say my previous prediction of life getting a bit on the hectic side is becoming reality. i don't know what i quite enjoy more: being busy with things to do or having a bunch of time unsure if i'll have anything to do. but somewhere in between the two extremes seems like the place for me. tomorrow is going to be my first trip out snowboarding this season and i'm looking forward to it. but i don't quite know how exciting this year will be with a major drop in snowboarding members this year. only time will tell though... so for a long time wanted to be a writer when i finally get done with all my schooling. then the thought occured to me what if i fail at that? what other kind of career would i be able to stand for the next quarter century. it's quite scary as my mind drift with these thoughts. i mean there's never been any other real desire to do something else. i would absolutely dread a factory or manual labor sort of deal because those jobs don't have the least bit of lasting impact. i do like US history but teaching doesn't seem to be the sort of job my mom dreamed up for me. maybe i could work for the History Channel or some national archives deal. hmmm...

      the past week's abandonment of this web log has been due to a lack of time and/or want to sit down to type. which should not to be mistaken for a lack of happenings because there's been plenty, good and bad. where do we begin? how about an abbreviated overview of the past few days (at least the parts you may care to know about)...  on saturday i went out with some friends in an unsuccessful attempt to watch a movie. although we did make it to taco bell and it was pretty good. i think roz got a little too excited about the mexican pizza but i guess spanish people have to represent. somehow the group ended up at mason's. tom who i hadn't seen in forever slept over. my sleepiness overcame any will to bother him as usual. next time... tuesday was the big one six birthday for me. best friend elizabeth made it special by calling without the knowledge that it really was my birthday. that aside, everyone else remembered and as with any sanders birthday we went out to eat. amber once again much like a protagonist in a medival fairy tale braved the perils of an evening with the family and accompanied me for the night. my restaurant selection being hoggie's in valley view. weird name, great food. gift certificates and cash were the order this year and both are welcomed here anytime... for new year's eve i didn't quite feel like acting a drunken fool all over bedford as most of my friends did this for me. my girlfriend came over and we had some always well needed alone time. that is, until my mom shows up with the rest of the family when they hear i am not under strict supervision with a girl. they have good intentions but leave me the fuck alone sometimes. oh well though... new year's eve saw a trip to the sounthpark mall (great northern was the goal but botched navigation was to blame) with mitch and amber. i got new shoes, the black version of my first watch (the tupac version if you will), and some pants. not too shabby... so last night i went out to eat at applebee's with amber, katie, kelly, and letty. and i think i might of pissed off letty included with a few other eating patrons. how you may wonder? well me and letty have always had this ongoing thing about saying mexican and chinese jokes. usually providing much amusement. i'm still wondering exactly what happened.  anyways the unstructured style of life i've become accompanied to over break is not one i am excititng to leave behind on monday. things just get so busy and hectic during school weeks. it stinks. i suppose i'll just set my thoughts on spring break.

      if you didn't already know, being grounded gives you a lot of time to think about the past week complete with the good but triumphed by the bad. with that first sentence you may be inclined to wonder what this kid did to get confined to the prison he sometimes calls home. did he steal his mom's new car and wreck it? no. go to a party and get caught drinking by the bedford city police? nice guess. actually i took my mom's car to fill it up with my mom's bank card. somewhere between my house, tom's, and the gas station i lost the card. not the "sexiest" reason to be punished and in my opinion, however partisan to personal interest, a really stupid reason. this brings me to one theme of this post, it seems like the past couple days i've just gotten in a load of trouble for things i didn't even mean to do. all of which quite frankly blows. the other monumental f*#% up of my week and one that found me much more disappointed in myself occured saturday evening. i had promised amber that i would show up at her grandmother's wake at 7-7:30 and at about 5:30 i fell asleep not arising until the fateful hour of 8. man i heard plenty of it, but honestly none of it was undeserved. but with some well thoughtout apology methods we are back on more than just good terms. always something great. but yeah of this has sucked so incredibly bad, i'm actually looking forward to monday cause i'll actually get to make human conact again. hoping to forget about these things which have brought down my week...  -tom went to the nordonia winter formal last night and his descriptions of white people dancing to "thiller" were absolutley hilarious.  -i've got 5 days until emancipation finally comes back to me. i'd imagine that i'll appreciate everything a lot more but frankly i always have. this attempt to teach me responsibilty is kinda pointless. can't wait to be free though. -in about 15 minutes i'll be enjoying american dreams as i usually do on sunday nights. i'm telling you it's a great show.  -today is 4 months to the day that i asked the prettiest girl out while watching cruel intentions on halloween. smartest thing i've ever done. every month my happiness grows undoubtably with every moment i spend in her presence. i love her tons even though she listed "good hygiene" as a reason for liking me. she likes me though :)

      it's been quite a long time since i've sat down to type. even long since i've written a decent post. but that's all about to change right here and now. the lack of post can probably been drawn from the fact that when i used to be bored or have free time i used to come here and put down my thoughts. now with my overzealous excitement for new found freedom i just call someone up and drive. i can't say that my gas guzzling passion will ever die down but i'll try to keep it at some sort of memory so i can keep writing in this thing. where do you start after a month of slacking? a lots happened, happily a lot more good than the bad, which is always a good thing.   some day during the week before we both recieved our licenses tom and i were hanging out at his house i believe. we kind of made a pact that after we started driving we'd hang out a lot more like old times. he's been my best friend for about 3 years now and frankly you miss hanging out with someone like that. and i'm glad to say we really have started to hang out. we're pretty funny kids if i do say so myself. he makes me chuckle everytime he lets his dislike for matt going out with his sister show, unintentionally or not. i make him laugh everytime i say poop, cause tom has always been a sucker for toilet humor. it's good to see him again.   i think for this post i'm going to focus on the people i've been around rather than the things that have happened, because they better represent why my months been good. they're the ones that cause the events of february anyways.   the new posse for me lately has been a combination of my friends and amber's friends. it varies from week to week who we actually see but the cast members include tom, kelly, letty, kevin, katie, amber, and me. i must say that laughter is all about the atmosphere when we're around... i'm going to kind of say my little thing about each of them and how they relate to me personally...   kelly is ridiculously funny but not on purpose. there's things she does that are just flat out weird but they're hilairous. she really, really, really likes cats so i always have some joke to say about litter boxes or cat food. although she hates me for that i don't care saying this, she's still cool in my book... letty has an abundant amount of stories so humorous you couldn't imagine. i've promise not to tell any but trust me on this one. letty and i probably aggrivate the group the most with our racist banter. she thought it'd be funny to call me a fortune cookie one day and i thought it'd be funny to call her a dirty taco. it just kind of snowballed from there... kevin is another friend i had grown apart from for a while. he's one to always been one to supply entertainment either stealing everyone's socks or started up a game of fuck, murder, marry (sorry i killed you katie). he's the kid that first introduced me to american pie and told me the story of dan toaz getting caught whacking off at band camp. i'm like one of two people in bedford who actually talks to his girlfriend and has been to vermilion so sometimes there's a joke or story i will understand. that sort of stuff... katie never ceases to have some witty (kevin's favorite word) comment or a good asian joke to unleash on me without hesitation. katie is basically allergic to every food known to mankind but somehow she make's great confectionary treats. chocolate covered oreos, quesadias (sp?), powdered sugar covered chex mix... you name it. it's very evident that she's a really caring person to, i mean even after i killed her in fuck, murder, marry she still married me! who does that? last friday kevin and i were picking on her for her boyfriend's early balding pattern. i noticed she took it all in stride. for some reason, maybe i like the abuse, but i appreciate good asian jokes. earlier in the week it was the chinese new year and she sure let me know it...  that's the group of rebels i've joined for now and those are the reasons i like them. this next little part is just something i needed to write down. please take it in context if you do decide to venture to read it. thanks to everybody who made it this far in reading my blog. we'll keep you posted.   amber it's a whole other story with. if you thought above was long, i could go on for days about this girl. most of it i think is way personal so i'd rather share it with her only. these past couple months have been my happiest in a while all thanks to her. she's the girl who knows all the little things to say at all the right times. the way i catch her look when she looks my way. it's so endearing. she makes me smile in ridiculously large amount. she's very special to me. she the one who really sincerely makes me hope other people have the chance to be so lucky as i've seemed to have been.

      after my previously failed attempt to pass the driving test, i passed last friday after school making me a very happy camper. trust me i've made well use of my emancipation from home in the past few days. the next morning (saturday) my best buddy tom passed. on his first try, of course the bastard always has to show me up. we did notice over the weekend that our parents are incredibly more lenient and nicer to us. maybe they are relieved that they won't have to even waste thoughts on where we are that very moment. they just know we aren't there and really in the end isn't that all that matters?  And for some odd reason this is where i ended it.

      the other day i already tried to type up a post and my computer wasn't having any of that in this house. in any event, we'll give it another try. this perseverant attitude seems to be one i have had to maintain recently. wondering what the hell i'm talking about? let me attempt to show you. no promises i'll be successful though...  shall we elaborate with the most obvious case... why not? so as mentioned in a previous blog i had my driving test last thursday. well i kind of got last minute nerves and backed my thang up (actually my 98' sunfire) right over a cone. major bummer because during in-cars i didn't even come close to touching that beautiful orange cone. anyways i will of course "give it another try" very soon. there's a funny story i have to tell y'all (my southern bell side coming out)... yesterday my mom took me to mayfield's license bureau place thinking they would leave the cones up for people to practice during after-hours. what a crock of bull, my mom and i, like always, were fresh out of luck. all we were left with were the paint markings for the obstacle course. one may foolishly make the mistake of thinking this would stop us in our tracks. we searched around finding various abandoned items: shopping cart, cardboard box, plastic jug, wood scaffolding, and the last (also by far the most uncooperative) a 2 by 4 off the wood scaffolding. there was another car practicing next to us, i could just tell they were like "yeah, they must be from bedford." my practicing went well except for the 2 by 4's spontaneously falling over for no apparent reason. my kids are definitely going to here this one.   on another note, i've been exceedingly happy with life and anticipation of other things fast coming on the horizon. tom is making his way back into a routine companion which is welcomed because we always have our fair share of funny times. my relationship with amber has left me completely struck with awe of her. our three month anniversary was a short time ago and she's really made me enjoy every minute. then there's driving soon if i don't again totally annihilate the manueverability course for a second time. freedom at last... of course not everything is a bed of flowers though. my friendship with liz has deteriorated to the shell of what it once was. i remember in one of her past blogs she mentioned our friendship as a "struggle" but she enjoyed the struggle. i can't even say that anymore and i'd be suprised if she still did. i've become comfortable with the realization that it's not going to be the same and is probably dead. stuff like this happens...   through all the good, the bad, and the just plain weird are all apart of life. maybe i'm simply becoming (if i haven't already) dumb but i'm settled with everythings going on. whether i want it to be or not, it's how it's going to be so why not be happy with it.   enough of ruining all of your precious eye sight. i'm out for the night. things are going good over hurre. how are things going over thurre? (to remind you i do go to bedford public schools) but really i hope everything is good with you... i don't want to pimp, it's just in my blood.

      i never seem to have the time to just sit down and write in this blog. but i really wish i would take the time out to write in this thing because it keeps me from forgetting everything that has happened to me. whenever i wonder what was going on with me a year ago i can always just look up the post for that day. just read and remember. with outside perspective i see why i did the things i did from like a shrinks point of view. sometimes when i'm in school i see someone i used to hang out with a lot. it makes me question why my connection with that person (no one specific. there's a couple actually) suddenly ceased to exists. then when i read about something like a weekend i spent with them i can remember why they were my friend and i can think of all the little things that became magnified by outside events. those influences are what kill relationships because if everybody didn't have any stresses on their personality then you'd never see the true beauty (or repulsiveness for that matter). when you do this sort of retrospective thing you can really see all the choices you had and how you reacted to them. (i'm typing like a banchi hear. so far i've only taking 8 minutes to write all of this. but what i want to say is coming to me ever so clear.)   this entry was sparked when i looked at everyone's online journals, whatever you'd like to call them. and afterschool today i went over to toms. we talked about a bunch of stuff. we always seem to do when nobody else is around. cause if we talked that honestly with a bunch of people we'd get criticized to no end. i think that's why i've changed the group of people around me. i used to hang out with a big group of people every weekend. yeah there's a lot more personalities with plenty of jokes but there's never that same openness (i spell checked it, promise) with so many people. now i hang out with small amount of people, usually like 4 or 5, which is cool. they listen so it matters when one is going through some shit. oh well back to what i was saying, you can tell what a person's desires and troubles are by reading their writings. like i read angie's older ones and you can tell she was unsure about things for a while. christine's everchanging opinions on everyone. liz's you can see her perpetual boredum with everyday life. brian's complaints about everything laid before him. katie's worries and unbounding humor. kelly's unsteadiness with the opposite sex. and i truly don't mean to start a riot or offend anyone but this is my interpretation of things.   i have this immense feeling of how fast everything is going. i always seem to be occupied by this idea. not to try and seem like a stubborn grandpa complaining how gas used to be a nickel, but things go. they go fast too. i mean look at where you are now. did you imagine it would be like this two months ago? i had no clue what was in store for me. on top of it all this is only high school too. there's so much more opportunity for a countless amount of things to happen to me. i'm waiting here for all this to happen with endless anticipation.

      i know i haven't touched this thing in quite some time but with little left to do after finishing my geometry quiz here i am once again. a lot has happened in the past two weeks. things have been hectic to say the least. after the accident and all there was a bunch of things in the air. i had a feeling that they were all about to crash upon me. but fortunately i found this to be a myth. well directly after the crash the cops had given me a ticket for failure to operate a motor vehicle which i had to go to court for last tuesday. the judge was incredibly and suprisingly understanding so the ticket will not be put through the system as long as i don't get another ticket within the next 6 months. so i kept my license but the sunfire was another story. it was totaled leaving me in search of a new set of wheels. i think i'm going to use the insurance check and some savings to get this dodge stealth. matt lynch's mom works at where the car is so she can drop the price for me about $2000. sweet deal. we're going to look at it later today. in any event that's what's going on with my driving life at the moment...  besides that i've been occupied with a ton of other things. some of it sucks but some on the other hand are quite grand. i've finally completely happy with the group of people i call my friends. usually there's always one person in a group that you just don't get along with or bothers you to death. at least that's what i got accustomed to these past couple years. but now, since there's been some people who i have just ceased talking to and others i've become reacquainted with, i've got a true group of friends. when we all go out there's no underlying hostility between two of them and that's a great thing.   it seems as if time has run on the short side so i'll try and update this again soon. go out and have fun, it's friday.

      with some spare time left before this evening's plans ensue, why not write down all these crazy thoughts i can't seem to hold on to in this blur of a week. tuesday's consequences have started to set in and i'm afraid there seems to be plenty more where that came from in the near future. still waiting for the car to be estimated and fixed, still waiting for the court date would could quite possibly end my driving career until december 2005. it's really becoming evident that one moment can truly resonate for a long... long time. the whole process kind of sucks big time right now but i mean what are you going to do about it now? i know what i'm going to do, wait.   on to other subjects because i'm sure i'll be submerged in the dealings of that subject for quite some time...

      after much talk and negociation i got off of my grounding but the results... sucked. lost control of the sunfire, hit a tree, car is pretty much totalled. maybe i'll talk about it in another blog. the worst of all this was amber being in the car. it's one thing when i could of got messed up and completely different when i realize she was in the same situation. although she did not seem panic striken i really wish i would of been by myself. this is completely the scariest day i've encoutered in a long time. but i'm going to head out.   i've said this before and now mean it more than ever. stay safe.

      you probably wouldn't think it, but in the span of three weeks a lot of things happen. the largest chunk of it being a great time, of course, life has its slaps in the face too. finally, i have time to sit down so i'm going to try to cover all the bases of me at this moment in time... finding the right place to start is harder to come by then i thought. how about...  thursday morning as i sat in fourth period taking my geometry quiz there was a knock on the door. i payed little attenion or thought to the office runner. then i heard "doug, someone's yankin you outta class" so i looked down at the note from the office. in capital letters it read BRING YOUR THINGS. YOU WILL NOT BE COMING BACK TO CLASS. for about five blissfully ignorant seconds, i was pondering what it exactly was i was needed for. then it hit like a load of bricks. i knew by the note's obvious urgency that my grandma had finally lost her struggle with alzheimer's. and i made my way down to the office and saw my uncle through the crack between the door and its hinge. his expression just confirmed my thoughts... i probably never forget the moment i knew what had happened. i really thought i was prepared for this to happen for the past 7 years. what a joke that was. when i got to the house it just destroyed me. for sure i will never forget that moment with my other uncle. under the saddest of terms, there was solace from him. even though i knew it would come it was still so incredibly hard.   today everyone was more than accompanying. my friends are really great. hryb was so nice and gentle with the whole situation. tom checked on how i was doing. brittany and christine were cool about things too... last night when i was with amber she did a great job of making me forget about bad things for a while. i felt a lot better with her near. (before i forget, she talked about katie and kelly's concern. that was nice to hear.) if you read this, thanks so much amber for doing all that.   it feels a lot better knowing everything now and talking (typing) about this stuff. hopefully i will be able to forget the pain, but i won't ever forget the great reasons that made her so much of a loss.  i won't forget...

      as i sit in the dark listening to led zepplin, i become enthusiastic about finding time to write. whatever is going on at the time seems so much more simpler and "handleable" when its put into written words. maybe that's what i enjoy so much about my blog and why journalism seems like a very phathomable career direction. it's also cool to read others online journals because its a way of keeping in touch with people when you couldn't otherwise. kudos to blogger and livejournal.   so i haven't mentioned it yet in this thing but if you've seen me recently, i'm sure i've bored you with talk of my new car. last saturday my mom finally got fed up with talking to car dealers and bought me a sparkly 97 chrysler sebring. quite frankly it's way nicer a car than i ever imagined my scrappy butt sitting in anytime soon. my mom is far more benevolent than i give her credit for. maybe i don't deserve this great car but i will in time. this is my car for a reason. the freedom of driving is liberating to me. all you have to do is think of a place you want to be and you go. just turn the key and you'll be there in no time. it's an all access pass to fun friday nights with your friends or to a quiet dinner with the girl you love. it's a good thing to have again.   i'd be lying to you if i said my life hasn't been of the highest quality lately. seriously i've been around friends that make me laugh without any cease in sight. spring break is soon and i'm going to take absolute full advantage of it. summer is sure to be here soon. it's going to be a good one i can tell. but without a doubt the major reason i am so happy recently is amber. she has never made it hard on me for the sake of meaningless cat and mouse games. we've always been able to keep it simple. we liked each other so we went out. i really always have enjoyed the simplicity of us. everything seems so much more bearable when she's around. no matter how bad of a day i've had, i know she'll be there to kiss me and make me forget all worries. it's great to know someone so wonderful is there and for the right reasons... she makes me smile. she is incredible.

      i love a good thinking challenge, so here we go...   D eftones  O asis  U sed  G reen day  give it a shot.   it's pretty late but i think a mini-me of a post is in order. today was weird to comment mildly. some more unneeded hassle which i have become all too familiar with. i don't want to really go into detail just yet, so let's not dwell. today was the senior awards ceremony at bhs and since my girl was getting a bunch of honors, i felt the need to show my support. i didn't mind going, but holy christ that ceremony was longgg... the auditorium was real hot and dr. hines voice is definitely not a songbird's. (atticus finch would shoot her if he had the chance.) amber looked real cute when she hugged ms. dean on stage, i was proud to see the oogles of awards my smart girlfriend got too. the whole event was nice and humbling however. hell, i'll be up there in the not so far future. isn't that crazy?  sleep tight kids...

      blogger has some absolutely pimpin new changes, if i do say so myself. it's got a bunch more new gadgets so anyone looking for a new online journal, give blog a try...  so two weeks removed from an update, i can't really say that anything life changing has occured in this short span of time. although i will say there has been plenty of fun to go around lately. i'm gonna say a short funny story to explain my site's subtitle about last friday night. anybody who hasn't already should read kevin's blog  urlLink   for his take on the night... finally getting together again since what seems for months, the friday night group (or at least a majority of it) hung out last weekend. the destination was marcelita's, this mexican restaurant kevin gave high marks. the food there was ridiculously tasty, esp. the 'guac' as we like to call it. the waitress i fear might very well of thought we were savages by our destruction of the complimentary chips at the table. i'm getting off track though, this is no food review. at that point it was me, amber, kelly, and kevin at dinner, the plan being we'd go putt-putt later with katie and her kevin. as we're waiting for kelly to get katie come with katie out of the house, i convinced kevin very easily to steal ms. miller's car. he seemed anxious at first but as we were driving the possibly funniest song ever came on: freeze frame. you know the one, where the only line (the title combined with a Woooooh..!) repeats to know end. we pulled up next to this guy blaring it. none of us could breath by the time the light changed. when we got back to katie's they apparently didn't have as funny of a five minutes as us. those two were pa-izzzed at kevin. i guess our ride had prevented putt-putt but i thought it was well worth it. the rest of the night was very low-key. correct that, me and the girl had a great time outdoors later. but that's another story.   prom is fast coming up with much anticipation. finally, amber and i have our outfits for the night. together we are going be drop dead sexy, those faint of heart and the pregnant would be best to look away. i'm trying to get the idea of putt-n-bay afterwards to catch on. we'll see how that turns out. it's going to be a fun night.   friday is the long, long awaited french class field trip. the odds of ms. morell actually getting this to work were not favorable to say the least. we're off to the cleveland art museum to see impressionist paintings and then to tower city to get our grub on. it'll be cool. i've yet to be on a field trip since heskett making it that much more enjoyable. i just hope i don't "je rate la bus". (that one's for kevin.)  this is getting long so i better wrap this up. with all this new state of the art blogging i'll be back soon. man i have bug bites all over me, anyone happen to know why??

      where have all the new post gone? nobody has touched their blogs and livejournals. i ask, "what up with that?"  it's sunday morning which means i should be a work, trusty caddyman that i am, (that rhymed!) but a bunch of persipitation says otherwise. i'm not one to argue with no work either. so i think i should write in this blog more than just every two weeks only when something historic happens. everyday things need their say too. realistically though, i'm probably bull poo-poo'in you when i say "hey i'm actually going to write in this thing a couple times a week". we'll see how it goes...  on friday, the event that the media and masses had so long waited for finally came, the six month anniversary of me and the pretty girl. we went to max and erma's who burger's are pimpin to say the least. then as amber would say after that we "watched" ferris buhueller's (sp?) day off. who doesn't like kissing their favorite girl? the answer: gay guys. i must say i am glad the way things have turned out for us. i've never been in a relationship before lasting over a month so this is all new and unexplored for me. i must say i like it though. six months is a long time but i'm planning on spending plenty more days with my girl.   this week has been kind of routine. everything seems to turn out that way at the end of a school year. it's completely foreign to me how there's only two more years til the fateful year of 06. i'm very anxiously awaiting the summer in which my friends and i can actually go places without pleading for a ride from someone. myrtle beach anyone?   if you could choose only one movie to watch the rest of your life, what would it be? i think i have a split decision between forrest gump and a bronx tale. oh wait i forgot about glitter and anything with bette midler in it. right....

      as i was checking up on my blogger profile, there was some cool stat keepers on the right which caught my eye. on average i post one blog a week, i've posted 87 times before, and i've written a combined 30,267 words. i wonder how long that would be in a document? but the average needs to be upgraded cause one a week is not cutting it. 87 times seems like a lot cause you can't just sit down and type that all up.   but anyways... last night was some car show in solon that absolutely everyone and there mothers attended. most notably: matt, tom, brandon, brandon's g.f (i've yet to remember her name even though she is remarkably nice), marcus, nate, the girl came with me, and my grandpa showing off his wheels. i enjoying seeing all the cars and such, but mostly i enjoyed catching up with some choice people. if you are in the small group of people i have come to call "my friends" then i'll enjoy seeing you whether by planning or pure chance. i was checking up on everyone's profile today and for some reason ms. kelly miller has decided to suck it up on blogger. what's up with that? kelly get in the game or get out.   today i'm going to some job fair for radioshack. i really want a job with normal hours that doesn't come down to manual labor. even though the pay isn't out of control, i don't think i'll have much trouble with it. which is very good by the way. we'll see how it all ends up. but it would be nice to have a customer relations kind of job.   has anybody seen the previews for anchorman and been absolutely waiting to see it? will ferrell has to be the most hilarious man on the planet next to dave chappelle. the movie looks like a keeper.   well i have to go catch up with the day that has already started. have a good one.

      howdy kids? what's happening in your neck of the woods my only hope could be today will be a big step up from yesterday. i've been in heavy working mode since our return from virginia beach still in debt with five dollars in my pocket. consequentally in a bad mood. maybe it's overexhaustion or something but whatever is the cause, it's much uncalled for. i know i've been way to quick to jump on people. i feel i have been way to suspicious of others and their motives lately. so in a apology, i'll promise to be more conscience of my actions. that's what i've been saying since i ran the sunfire off the road. maybe my problem is i just don't pay attention enough and i feel like everything is bound to work itself out. probably an all to naive though, so i might as well just abandon the trust that comes along with thinking it. what felt like the dagger through the heart is yesterday when i realized i was the fault for wasting the day. when a day is bad i'd rather end it on a good note even if it was bad cause at least there's something happy or worthwhile to that day ever occuring. stupidly, it only was successful in feeling unwanted in the circustances. i definitely shouldn't have pushed as hard as i did. it's been so foreign to me to have that feeling, it was a huge shock to the system i guess. i felt really stupid for pushing away the one i love the whole day and what i had done after. i just felt totally stupid with everything i did. i hate that feeling to say the least. but as with this post, i feel like i'm just talking getting nowhere fast.   things need to be fixed...

      long time, no post.. ehh? i've got a post from the road to virginia beach which i'll put up when i have the time to type. but for all of you that aren't up to date, i went to virginia beach last week with my mom and favorite girl. it was i must say, my kind of vacation. laying out with amber, jet-ski'ing, riding on the dolphin watch boat with the little kid who can't keep her lunch down, etc. all those musts for every vaction. it was cool. the drives there and back were killer but i think we scared some truckers on the way, danny wagner has a clue with what to do on long trips. walking (or sitting) on the beach when it gets dark has to be one of my favorite pastimes. i think me and amber did that every night. maybe one day we'll have kids and move out there. cause one night there was lightning over the water, it was really pretty. cuddling with amber on the way to la-la land was very nice and other things were too.   i just enjoyed good company in a nice place the whole trip.

      another lazy day on broadway avenue. are there any other kind?   sorry if i'm typing slow, not that you could tell. the egg sandwich my mother made is bangin so excuse me. i think i'm all caught up on this i need for virginia beach but ya never know. to my suprise i woke up and it's not raining. some work on de-farmer's tanizing may be what the doctor ordered. and how about a trip to best buy cause cd's are like $10. not that i have money anyways. after much search on tuesday, i discovered my keys were locked in on the seat of my car sitting at southpark mall during closing time. after an hour, mom sanders finally got there with the replacements. pour the salt on.   yesterday we watched edward scissorhands. it was good but really blunt. j depp did very good considering he only had like 5 lines. i liked it. better than the ring that tom, jack, nate cole, kelly, amber, and i watched together. they had a good story with a horrible ending. oh well.  i better jump in the shower today before the neighbors start complaining. take care.

      it's getting kind of late but i feel a brand spankin' new post is in order. summer has finally arrived and i feel very relieved of the extreme duty my courses gave me this year. breaks are always nice. i am in desperate need to find a new job though, cause hawthorne valley country club is taking it up the rear on membership. oh well, applications galore tomorrow. so how have you spent your break so far? i've enjoyed mine, lot of time spent working. i guess that stuff comes with the freedom of a car. i attended graduation last thursday and the speeches were of much higher quality than i predicted. i was also feeling like a pround parent when amber got her diploma. gay i know, but that's how i was feeling. afterwards we all went out to eat and our moms met for the first time. the laci peterson case's details seemed to be a lot more interesting to them then to the rest of us. in two short years i'll be the one walking across that stage... crazy. so i finally have tried strawberry shortcake this weekend even though i've live around bedford like the past 6 years. mighty good stuff they make down there. if it didn't sound like it in previous post, i am looking forward to this summer. it's just this is a lot different cause i know it won't be strictly a "friends" summer but a nice relationship thrown in there. from what i've heard nobody has done anything miraclous except lie around their house this since thursday. i can't say i blame them either. next sunday, my mom is taking me and amber to virginia beach which should be cool. i'm looking ahead to lying on the beach and making fun of people like at coventry (j.k). well i'm packing it in for the night. have fun with whatever you're up to.

      before i jump in the shower to wash off that post-work feeling, why not put up a nice little post? sounds like a good idea. sunday evening is slowly lurking in the backround and i'm reminded of what used to be the usual routine for this certain time of each week, american dreams. great times but when the fuck are you coming back? anywho.. i've been thinking about this summer lately. except for the general plan for it i'm creating, i've noticed how different this one will be then those passed. don't get me wrong i believe this one will be the best to date, only different. last summer i hung out with people like marcus, liz, erin hoyt, jessica vita, people like that. i find myself totally separated from most in my daily life. some from falling outs, others from gradual loss of contact. it's odd that everyone who used to play big roles have discreetly exited or been dismissed from friendship while others have filled these roles in their own way.   different, huh?

      why howdy y'all... i think i'll always regret that fateful choice to order a cowboy burger the night of homecoming. kelly loves to remind me, all the time. it's cool though: whisker's are only 58 cents with a giant eagle card.   holy crap it's been forever since i've typed or had the time to type in this thing. i'm not going to recap every single thing occuring since then, but some highlights: prom was last weekend. it was real fun although a little long. if our school wouldn't be so lazy and have an afterprom i think it would have been a little better. oh well, it's bedford so improvement is only something to pray for. i had a great time with everyone, most outstandingly amber. the next day, i had the idea instead of going to an amusement park or something generic we'd go to spend the day at the better sites of cleveland. amber and i attended the cleveland art museum which suprisingly has many areas neither of us had ever known existed. (i liked the landscape pictures in the american art room the best.) then to tower city for food and shopping. we also went to parma town mall on the way home. i had a nice time. the other major happening in modern times is the upcoming closing of school and departure of the senior class. i'll miss a lot of people. katie and kelly at lunch. brittanie dial in the mornings. teri when she sees me parking next to her mysteriously much like a stalker would. obviously and most of all amber. not that i won't see her. it's just nice to have chance run-ins with the one you adore. i have a solution to all these goodbye blues... fail the whole entire senior class so they are bound here forever. i think i like it.  last night was the rib burn off. the food was absolutely beastin'. there were some good laughs. we went to cyber pete's but i think everyone was too tired for a wild time. it was an alright night though.   after what seems to have been the longest, but funnest school year to date has now been dimished to only finals week now, summer is almost in full stride. there are a couple of things i hope to accomplish before junior year will undoubtably sneak up upon me. the following list comes with the condition/idea to stay out of trouble during these actions. in no specific order:  -get a job, if possible an enjoyable one.  -achieve some sort of physical fitness so i can go to the beach with some dignity. -have great fun on vacation with amber and my mom to virginia beach. i'm sure that won't be difficult.  -hang out more with all my friends. especially mitch and tom cause we haven't just hung out in forever. i miss hanging out with both of them, hilairous kids. -spend time with my favorite girl, of course. why not be with the person who makes you happiest? all the laughs and little things make everything so good.   so those are my plans for a great summer. what are yours? (post your own or i have comments.) well i'm off to get this shaggy mess trimmed down. take care and watch your step... unlike grandma hryb. hahaha.

        i am definitely going to take advantage of this color text thing blog is providing. since brown is the only thing that matches brown, it makes color selection quite simple. taking a page out of mr. balough's book... amber's going to call me back so i'm going to type away until then.        &nbsp;    things are finally looking up, even though you wouldn't expect it with all the fighting that's gone on lately. after a lot of unsureness (sp? if that's even a word) amber and i had made everything better. upon leaving to pick her up my mom decided to create a big stink about being out late (i was going to be home the whole time). one way or another i got grounded for the night. she tries to put her foot down at the wrong times. anyways i've been reduced to sitting at home. at least being allowed the simple pleasure of talking on the phone to a nice girl brings a smile to my face.        &nbsp;    phone, ring, buh-bye.

      with some spare time, i bring you all this post. a bunch of things are happening all at once, but unfortunately, i can't say most are of the highest quality. a wake, reminders of those passed, and a future lonely school year just aren't the things that make you jump up with enthusiam.   it's probably me thinking about focusing on the negatives too much. whatever it is, it sucks. i really wish people (who for the most part have higher numbers in age) would keep their opinions to themselves about amber and i. sorry i wasn't concentrating on amber leaving for college to ruin my day, but no worries, you've changed all that. i don't give a damn what everybody else has to say about us and our situation, because it's for us to decide.   today my mom and i made a b-line for my grandma's grave out of nowhere. we dropped off some nice flowers but i finally had come to feel some closure on that area of my life. i've had about a million people bring her death up the past weekend. it's not a subject i'm comfortable with yet, still doubtful for a long while. when you miss someone like that, it's just not easy to talk or think about it.   i know i'm just complaining but things seem to be on the downside lately. not even horribly tragic events, little things that give a sense of some massive conspiracy against one's self. for example i couldn't go with amber to aurora farms in the company of her sister because i promised my mom i'd be home at 6 to eat a homecooked meal. well amber understands but her sister sure didn't. so after going there to pick her up i become informed that her sister is flipping out and she's going to attend to the shopping trip. i don't understand why people can't let others do what they want. it was gay. and i'm not mad because i understand the circumstances. they just blow.   maybe tonight or tomorrow will find me with more passion for life. we'll see. hope everything is on your side for the time being. i hope for a change in me.

      the week has drawn to a close so fast. i barely have time to catch up with this week. it's been sort of a blur, but a good blur none the less. why don't we give a shot at re-capping the past two days which have signified important dates.  wednesday was mine and amber's 8 month anniversary of romance. i enjoyed the company for the night. since the cd has been out for months and i knew i wanted to get amber it. i finally purchased speakerboxx/the love below and proved to be a worthy choice. i hope from the bottom of my heart see agrees with the choice cause she is one i hold in high regard. then my mom made a joke about having a coupon to olive garden, something to the regard of mitch's love of rebates. so we went to olive garden to mark the night. she had some crispy chicken that was most satisfying. i ordered the tour of italy, consisting of chicken parmigiana, chicken alfredo, and lasagna. much to my please it was mucho good. then we split chocolate lasagna for desert, having to be the smartest thing we've done in these great eight months. so after being offered wine by the waitress and weird people's glances towards our table, we made our exit: three dollars richer from that damn coupon. then we spent a good night at home, watching tv. emphasis on watching tv. i really enjoy all my times in that girl's presence. she makes me incredibly happy, i don't think anyone could phatom how much, even her. i'm going to miss her a ton this fall.  then yesterday was my uncle jeffrey's big 32. we went to this small italian place named Angie's Pizza. they had cheese salads best described by my uncle as 75% cheese, 25% actual lettuce. such a great culunary invention. then pizza was also of high quality. plus i love joking around with my family, they have a good sense of humor with others. my aunt cheryl had some grief with donny's side order of anchovies and their radiating smell. afterwards i finally got amber to watch the sixth sense. i think i got in some hot water by jumping at her when the little girl comes out from under the bed. not the brightest idea, but hilarious none the less. sorry amber i had to do it. the rest of the night was nice just cuddling and accidentally drifting into periods of sleep.  this post has gotten out of hand large but oh well. catch your attention later.

       wow, has it been a long time since i've posted. after like a month or something, the sudden urge to type comes in the middle of the night. but i guess it just happens that way. the urge to sit down and write during the summer doesn't come around too often, because there's so much to go out and do without scheduled appointments. school's waiting for everyone in a couple weeks so i suppose i'll get around to this blog more often. hopefully...      i don't think it's possible to re-cap everything that's happened since we last conferred. instead i'll just randomly write about things that i remember. worth a shot at least...      about two weeks ago my mom went to las vegas so i got to spend my own vacation with a free house. no big party's or anything. i liked watching rented movies with amber. poker night was fun cause everybody who came was somebody i enjoy for different reasons. we went to eat at some awesome places cause my mom let ample food money for the week. corky and lenny's in mayfield had the best damn cheesecake, too. golf team is slowly beginning again. personally, i think i'll improve a lot. the team is a different story. what can you do about such things though? nothing, that's right. today i went with amber and mitch to great lakes mall. our stop for food at the roadhouse sucked cause it took like an hour to get the main course and the waiter forgot everything i asked for. except for that minor disappointment, i had fun. i liked talking to mitch for more than 3 minutes again. old joking as usual. i got a bunch of good deals still spending everything i brought. amber doubled whatever i spent though. she's a master at that. there's so much at that mall. parma is a shame. it was definitely worth the gas to get out there. tom just got back from florida. his descriptions of the trip sounded unfulfilling for a vacation, anywho i'm glad he's back. we hung out for a night with amber and mike. a nice time. mike is a lot cooler than i originally thought. i've been getting into poker a lot lately. texas hold'em is very addicting. at least my friends are into so we have something new to get together for. as before mentioned, school's coming up soon which i never mind to much cause everybody i'm friends with haven't dropped out yet. emphasis on yet. amber's moving into kent the same week bhs starts. that might be a hard week. i know it's not cross-country but it's still a lot farther than before. i've never been into the long distance thing. i guess something new always challenges us, but it'd be cool if she was still nearby. i know i'll be walking in the hallways and catch myself looking through the crowd expecting to see her. those times will suck. i have a car though so i'll be down there as often as possible. it's going to be rough the first couple weeks.       anyways, for my last thought: i'm tired.
