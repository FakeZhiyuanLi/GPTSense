      so, i didn't get paid. but here's the deal.  i started work on january 12. if i get paid today, i don't get paid for the new year holiday. if i get paid on the 12 of february, i do get the extra 3 days. i can survive until the 12th, so i can wait. it doesn't seem like he's trying to fuck me in any way.   at this point everything seems above the board... he does have to pay two other people he owes lots of money to, who need to be paid for shit he owed them before i even got here. if he borrows from peter to pay paul, i mean... if he hums and hawws about paying them so he can pay me, which is sometimes the case, then they get fucked. i don't want that. so i'll wait until the 12th.   i'm still fine. i don't think i'm taking that much of a risk; no more than being here in the first place anyways. he's doing his best to be up-front with me, i think mainly because i know about his 'past'. really, i don't know mark and i don't know mr. kim. so trusting either dude is a gamble. i'm still on the defensive though.

      ok. so the panic attacks have subsided. all is well for the most part.   clearly privacy means something totally different in korea. when hannah lived here, her classes were videotaped. in almost every contract i've seen, there has been a clause that your director has keys for your apartment and can inspect it at any time. so when yong-tak came in to work yesterday and said "oh, i saw you were looking mark's post on eslcafe.com" it explained why monster came home the night before and said, out of the fucking blue...  "sean, if you are worried about getting paid on time, don't worry. i will pay you on time. we like you, the students love you, we are happy you are here".   of course i'm freaked. why would he know? yong tak came in to work the day after he said that and i was convinced he was examining the history of the school computer... had i forgotten to clear it? is he snooping or running some spy software? he's usually in the school 2 hours after i am.   what happened? here's what happened. i had printed the post up for bill, and he left it on his coffee table. yong-tak read it, and since bill's situation is as precarious as mine, bill just said "i don't know what that's about, sean found it on some website... it sounds CRAZY!!!" which is exactly what i said when yong-tak... and then monster confronted me about it. monster even printed the damn thing up and said "oh, i read it, and i just think it is funny". i made it clear with the guy... "well it makes me a little nervous to read something like this, but i deal with you. if you fuck with my pay, i take action. if you don't, then mark is wrong about you and there's no need to worry.    so...   here's what's up for those of you who are worrying about me.   1. i am poised to get the fuck out of dodge. i can pack my shit in 10 minutes. all my important, hard to replace documents, i.e. reference letters, passport, etc. are somewhere else where monster can't get his grubby kimchi-covered mitts all over it.  2. i have the financial means to do this. i'm fine, money-wise. (i also have one new pair of PANTS thanks to my jedi father). 3. my first payday is tomorrow (thursday jan. 29). if he waffles on paying me, i will say "WHEN can you pay me?" because, shitbag or not, things do happen, and it's a small school. but he gets one chance. i will make it abundantly clear that it looks really bad for him to be not paying me with what mark has said about him, and that i am a million miles from home, and it's just unacceptable. if he misses the second date, i bail. i leave him in the proverbial lurch, because at this point very few recruiters will work with him. nobody in town will... 4. like princess leia, i have powerful friends. if i bail and monster threatens me with visa shit, my recruiters, who know korean law as well as he does, will do him like he's a boston choirboy.   so, that's it in a nutshell. he knows that i know. he knows i'm on my guard and knows that i could leave andong in a heartbeat and (since i haven't signed a contract yet) there's nothing that can be done about it legally.   so, really, i'm in a good place. i do feel like i'm the one steering this ship. i don't mind working for someone with a shady past and questionable business ethics... as long as i get paid. i mean shit, i worked for ace window cleaners for 6 years.    so stop worrying already. the idea of bailing is appealling-i like adventure! i have options in taiwan and japan. also, wonny and the girls have said they'd place me in a different korean job in days. if i stay here, monster is sort of in check. he will pay me, or he knows i will leave. i don't really want to leave, i truly dig some of the students. and andong is nice. it's like a korean kelowna. or calgary.   what else? some of the andong foreigners eat pig intestine last night. i watched. i drank beer. i needed a beer at the sight of that shit.   korea is north america's cultural dumping-ground. the movies on TV here suck. i watched TOP GUN the other night and was surprised at how haute couture it was in comparison to some of the dreck i've been watching.   what are you reading? i was going to read the fountainhead by ayn rand and see what has got republicans and socialists in such a tizzy... i haven't seen so many people at odds since duran duran was a band... too bad my copy was missing the first 17 pages. damn used book stores. all of them are run by pinkos.   so i switched to "the forty days of musa dagh", a story about armenian resistance to turkish genocide in WW1. it's good. just another historical novel... but good. it helps me understand my good pal aram... only he isn't running around chasing goats. perhaps he should be.   you can all send me literature. i have to go to seoul to buy books. there are no english language books in andong. send me something you think has literary merit.   music? thin lizzy. themselves. the darkness. integrity. fugazi. slayer. nothing really new there.

      well since i sent out a big "i updated my  blog" email here's an update. if you post on the nwhardcore.com board or are in my 'close personal friends of sean' fan club you have already read the meaty stuff.   it's still cold. i went to danyang yesterday, a little town on the road to seoul. the whole area looks like the area around shuswap lake, really similar with its 50/50 decidious/coniferous ratio.   my boss is still omnipresent. wants to be my buddy. his kid woon is a terror, i wish i knew what the hell he was saying to me. he is a lot like my nephew liam, the prince of darkness.   i got some photos developed... i will try to find a scanner and maybe enlist the help of master horticulturalist/master html-ist josh payton to post it on here so i won't have to send you all annoying emails that take two weeks to load.   pants are on their merry way. pretty soon i'll be emailing "send me SHORTS!!!" but there's a dickies' outlet in town and i can just make me some cutoffs.   if you feel so inclined you can telephone me at 082-010-3157-0770. actually 082 is the korea country code, i don't know exactly tho. dial the operator and ask, then dial my number, the 010-etc. after the country code and you're cookin' with gas.

      ok so i'm a little calmer today. i think there is good reason to be wary of what any fruitcake says here, i just gotta watch my shit. i met the andong foreigners last night and they proved to be the sober, objective middle ground between bill and mr. kim. some really good peeps, jay, andy, andy's girlfriend, sarah, and some other dude. andy is from miramichi, NB. and really cool. he walked me home because i was lost.   some things i forgot to mention?   another part of my paranoia that i forgot to mention was that it was most definitely plausible that mr. kim would have gone into my room and ransacked my shit. i had written a bunch of postcards, they were tucked inside a book. i got home one night and mr. kim says "oh, i see you are writing your family, your grandfather, your friends... that is good" or something like that. he has definitely snooped, so maybe he'd stoop too. i just have to defend my privacy in clever ways.   on top of bill being a weird dude in general... he attempts to follow korean customs in a really strange way. one of those customs is gift-giving. most korean stores sell gift packs, so he was scanning the selection in the LG25 (korea 7-11). he didn't like the soap, he thought brandy was inappropriate, as was soju. what did he settle on?   SPAM. he bought mr. and mrs. lee a zipper-bag gift pack of maybe 25 cans of SPAM. 40,000 won (roughly 40 CDN) worth of SPAM. i just sat there shaking my head.   for those of you that know what a shit-brown poffenroth knob is... well, they have them here too, much to my pleasant surprise. andy from miramichi knows andong very well.

      so i was overreacting. perhaps bill's paranoia is somewhat justified... but in my case it was not a factor. passport and ticket intact.   it was -18 C in seoul, perhaps the cold was altering my senses.  clearly my director is someone to be watched like a hawk... but i will relax for now. beers with yong tak tonight!!!

      I'm in Seoul. my trip to seoul has given me some disturbing revelations that, if you are the slightest bit concerned for me and either 1. have high cholesterol (dad) or 2. are a smoker (mom, patricia) or 3. are a general worrywart stresscase (michelle, parge, dave, aram, john, anyone else) then you need to read this and relax and realize i have all under control. sit down, smoke a pound of marijuana and relax. i am the king.   1. i get my job in andong. my director mr. kim was desperately looking for a foreign teacher because this dude mark flew the coop. i learn that mark had 'committed sexual crimes' against a 6 year old student at the school. naturally i am shocked, these kids are so innocent and nice... well some of them. i find out that mark lives in vancouver and i joke with mr. kim about how i am going to beat him up when i get back to canada. it's all black humor, and mr. kim likes me more because i'm firmly on his side.   2. mr. kim is nice to me. he feeds me. he helps me get a cellphone. i live in his house. since i live in his house, his sweetheart of a grandmother cleans my room for me. it irks me at first, but people have warned me about a different attitude towards privacy here in korea. so i chalk it up to cultural difference and let it slide. it's just weird because i don't think my mother even cleaned my room after i was 3 years old.   3. mr. kim and i become bosom buddies, and eventually he becomes rather omnipresent. i like my 'sean time' and he's always asking me to come see temples, go to dinner, etc. i draw the line at going to the sauna with him because he reveals that there's a whole bunch of nudity. i can't handle getting naked with a bunch of other dudes, especially when i'm about a foot taller and 900 pantone shades whiter than almost every man here. i stick out like a sore thumb on fire. so i politely decline.   4. i go out drinking with mr. kim's younger brother yong-tak. it's fun. we get home, and mr. kim pulls korean rank on him... and goes rank on him. i hear them arguing rather loud in the next room and i bail, go for a walk to show that it's inappropriate for them to argue when i'm in earshot, even when i don't know what they're saying. mr. kim assures me "oh, we both went to law school and we get like that sometimes". yong-tak says "oh, he was getting mad at me for drinking. he says 'why you drinking'?". that was the day of my first and final ESL hangover.   5. i drive to seoul yesterday with my co-worker bill. here's where i digress a bit; bill is 50-something, a vietnam vet, tall and skinny and nerdy in the extreme. he has a korean girlfriend about his age, whom he talks down to. he speaks in ESL to everyone, slow and metered tones, simple sentences, repeats himself alot and adds synonyms so you'll get it. what he doesn't realize is that i started speaking english about 31 years ago and am comfortable with the average discourse.        5a. bill tells me what really happened with mark the molester. mr. kim, or 'mr. monster' as bill calls him, was 4 million won behind in mark's pay. 4 million won is roughly 4000 dollars canadian. mr. kim has mark's (canadian) passport, and after many disputes, they both decide to cut their losses. mark bails and goes back to canada via England (unbeknownst to mr. kim he had dual citizenship), mr. kim decides paying 2 million won to hire me is more cost-effective than paying mark his arrears. i start work, he  talks mad shit about mark the 'molester' and all seems well.         5b. bill takes me to meet mr. lee, a gem of a man who put bill up in his apartment when his first job fell through. mr. lee, like most korean men, drinks like a fucking fish. they get progressively drunker, they smoke about 2 packs of cigarettes each, it's 3am, mr. lee's wife is getting really angry, i want to go to sleep, mr. lee's kids are getting angry, i want to go to sleep, bill is getting drunker and louder and more ESL with me and mr. lee, also he tells the same fucking stories like 6 or 7 times. this is perhaps the most profoundly uncomfortable experience i've had in years, perhaps only some of my uncle chris' drunken shenanigans compare in their utter stupidity and imposition. by 10 am the next morning, i'm ready to throw bill out a window. he has maybe a dozen stories which he re-tells in series, much like the shopping network or some shit like that.        5c. what comes of our conversation though is that it becomes abundantly clear that i must be careful around mr. monster. i have to keep up on my agreed pay scheme. i have to be firm. the dude asked me for my passport (illegal), ostensibly for 'safe-keeping' but it's obvious to a 2 year old retard that it's his only insurance that i won't do what mark did. it's also my only insurance since my visa isn't processed yet. so i tell him no, i'm more comfortable with it in my possession, i pat my breast pocket and say 'yeah, i lost it once in thailand. i'm never going to let that happen again'. he knows he has no argument and he shuts his mouth.   6. i ditch bill, to avoid a murder charge in a foreign country. did i mention that people who smoke around other people should be stabbed in the fucking face? sorry mom. bill smokes in his girlfriend's car when she asks him not to and then makes comments about how obedient oriental women are. he is, while an ally, slowly becoming one of the most repugnant human beings i've ever been forced to be around. so i'm off to see some palaces and the art museum. i look for my cellphone, and in the pocket where my passport and plane ticket were - NO PASSPORT. NO PLANE TICKET.   now alot of you know i'm a pretty absent minded dude. it's 3:03 pm, i'm waiting for the 3:40 bus back to andong so i can figure out whether or not i left it at home, whether mr. kim went into my room when i was in the shower and ransacked my jacket pockets, or whether i've just lost the fershlugginer thing.   what makes me suspicious is that bill dished out all sorts of dirt on mr. kim, how he has farted around in paying bill, that 6 foreign teachers have worked at the school in the last year, that 'black suit man' (korean mafia?) comes by to collect money and they have heated discussions (i've witnessed them but they're in korean) about some shit that obviously stresses mr. monster...  and then mr. monster invites me 'to casino'. does this guy have gambling debts? he apparently was a bit of a playboy up until a little while ago. he owned a bar, then he went into partnership in this english school. then his partner bailed and he had to bail him out.   there's so many fucked up things surfacing. all i want to know is that my passport and plane ticket are safe because i have enough resources to bail on korea - i think i've seen enough beautiful stuff and met enough nice people here for it to still be a pleasant memory - and go to japan or taiwan where the economy is apparently way better.   phew! i had to get that out. this may all end up to be a bunch of bill's paranoiac blabbering. he's a drooling retard in many respects... he tried to tell me that "well, the holocaust happened, but i do believe the jews upped the numbers a great deal". i tell him about impeccable nazi record-keeping and he admits that he has no argument and waffles.   i'll wait and see. i guess i find out in about 6 hours if my passport is safe and sound and if i have to put the screws to my boss, who has a history of not paying people, 7 days before my first payday.   happy fucking lunar new year! i need a drink.   (oh yeah, and don't worry about me. if the shit hits the fan, i'll bail. i have quite enough resources and an incurable wanderlust. if my new 500 dollar cellphone doesn't work in japan or taiwan i'll hit it with a brick, take a dump on it and mail it back to mr. kim with a note that says "oh, i forgot to give this back to you!".  my name isn't on the 1 year contract, his is. he can't return it in 100 turd-covered pieces).

      two things to never, ever do again:  1. drink draft beer in korea.  2. teach ESL to middle school kids with a hangover. even a mild hangover.   i had this teacher, mrs. bjornson... word on the street is that she was a major vodka-swiller. she sure had a red face... anyways, i don't know how she handled it. day in, day out. pounding head, hyperactive children. what a bad idea.   the weekend was really nice, i was shuttled from temple to confucian school to temple. it was really quite beautiful, a winter wonderland. and as much as these people eat bibimbap you'd think there'd be bad bibimbap in korea. i don't think such a thing exists; every successive bibimbap is better.  i've eaten octopus twice. once raw. i've eaten a lot of weird shit. squid eggs... this plate of mackerel and halibut sashimi the size of a child's bed... dried persimmon... about the only thing i have not been able to stomach so far has been sesame leaf. i can't do it, it just tastes like soap. whattaya do?   oh another thing-never sing metallica in a karaoke bar. it's like having a tattoo on your face, nobody understands, man.

      last night, while cruising through downtown andong, i found a store called.... (drum roll)...   BABY HUNT.  .   that's the name of my next band. BABY HUNT.   the first distinctly asian thing i saw here was a truckload of dogs being carted off to the slaughterhouse... so i'm thinking that this is a country of mass cruelty. all whining aside, cruelty can be fucking hilarious.   BABY HUNT. i'm getting that tattooed on my arm tomorrow.   BABY HUNT.

      so yesterday i experimented with pictionary. with some kids, it went over like a lead turd. however, one of my advanced classes, who are all extremely shy for some weird reason, took to it like most people take to breathing.   i'm trying to crack the whip a little bit, though it seems that with a lot of the little buggers i'm talking way over their heads and a little too fast. what is worst about that is that none of them will speak up to say "slow down, teacher!!!"  but they'll yell "teecha! teecha!" and make a joke in korean that is lost on me.   so i have found out that i can get mail here at the school, if you want to send me stuff, LIKE PANTS, you can.   sean o'leary c/o REI language school. 709-79T Agwhadong, Andong, South Korea.  that's all for now. i'm told pants aren't as big a problem as i thought, but send me pants anyways. free pants make the world go round.

      day 2, andong.   so here's some catchup. the flight worked out just fine. the worst thing about it was walking around LAX, us airport security is truly the most retarded thing in the world. asiana airlines didn't charge me a fee for my flight-change, so that was 75 USD saved. i arrive in busan to my recruiters, and it fills me with a little bit of dread because it becomes clear to me that they are just 3 girls with cell phones and a nice website. it's not like the JET program or anything, just a totally indie operation. therefore the 3 hour ride to andong was filled with a teeny bit of trepidation. but they bought me some snazzy bibimbap in a roadside cafe; jetlag and all i was feeling like a champ.   we meet mr. kim (who the fuck woulda known, a korean guy named mr. kim?), and after a lengthy meeting that was conducted about 25% in english, i got the job. mr. kim "really wanting work with me" according to wonny, winnie and hye-yah. still scared as shit, but whatever, it's adventure.   mr. kim has totally opened up his house to me, he gave me the use of 2 bedrooms, a key to the house, has said that his grandmother will do my laundry, give me unlimited kimchi and rice, etcetera. about the only thing that sucks about it is the brazen cold of his house. it's very drafty and heated by little space heaters.   after a few hours of settling in, mr. kim took me shopping, bought me a razor (we're on 110v here), cereal, juice and beer. it's good so far.   DAY ONE OF TEACHING.   we pull up to the school, mr. kim putters like a champ around his office, i smile and nod. there seems to be a fair amount of down time in the morning here. we split a giant pot of soon-doo-boo, my fave korean dish. i don't see why everyone is warning me about the soon-doo-boo here, it's way spicier in vancouver. the thing that is different is that two of the side dishes are NOT pickled potatoes but tiny dried minnows. they taste like fish jerky really, not half bad.   at 12:30 i am tossed into the fray. tossed to the proverbial lions. i had an idea that the kids would be rather merciless, and some were. some just didn't pay attention. i did my best to speak slowly but nerves got the better of me. "TEE-CHA, speak slower... speak less difficult" was the refrain... i ended up eating a lot of humble pie and getting my waegook ass laughed at quite a bit as the troublemakers yammered to their friends in korean.   the good thing about it - i have been nicknamed "HURK". which i orignally thought was "herc", short for "hercules" but i soon realized that korean kids have not seen all that much shitty 1960s canadian TV. so what i thought was "herc! herc!" was actually HULK with a korean accent... and because of my size i have become this bellowing giant in their eyes. i always knew i was an awe-inspiring dude but it's good to have that idea reinforced by 100 kids.   i survived the day. i think the worst thing is going to be dealing with the constant activity, i had a bit of a stress headache at the end of the 6 hours. i felt really flustered, and with the jet lag i was ready for bed around 7.   mr. kim's brother yong-tak is a cool dude, he's taken to me like an old friend... he took me and his buddy out for this crazy korean stew and soju. soju is gross, like weak gin. but the conversation was pretty good, just "what do you do in YOUR country" kinda stuff. he likes black sabbath and his favorite band is queen so i think we will get along swimmingly.   it's 10:30 am. mr. kim will be here soon to ramble on in broken english. i think i'd better go and get some chow. more soon.

      ARGH. as if life could have gotten any worse. anyways i get to the airport, check in ON TIME and with the US customs lineup i'm 1 minute late for my flight to LAX. ONE MINUTE. ONE MINUTE.   alaska airlines sets new standards for unaccountability; their lackey at the ticket desk's attitude was "i work for alaska airlines, not the US government, why should i warn people about how bad the lineups are?"  i have never wanted to murder someone as badly as i did last night. i'm sleeping on michelle's couch. i so badly want to leave this city, it's like the bermuda triangle.

      wow.   i'm packing and packing and there doesn't seem to be any end to it. shit has been so fucked for the last 24 hours... i get back to vancouver from a barnstorming tour of the okanagan and alberta. i brought the severe cold with me i guess because vancouver is colder than a witch's tits in antarctica.   a development: the school on geoje closed. it just up and closed. wonny (my recruiter in busan) broke the news tonight at around 6pm. she frantically scanned my options and found me a job in andong, about 50 miles north of busan. this was a major disappointment, but i guess i'll have to suck it up. it just was not meant to be. at least andong looks halfway cool and isn't too far from the ocean. lots of historical sites, lots of markets and stuff, and not too large of a city. my director mr. kim wants to make sure "i don't drink during the week" but that's exactly what i'm doing right now.   we'll see how it goes. i have 3 days to clean and move shit. this is where i find out who my 'real friends' are i guess. i'd type the letters 'L','O' and 'L' in succession but that would make way too much sense. things don't make sense right now.

      this is a message for jay, the dude who is going to be stationed near seoul. first, how the hell did you find my blog? it'd be like finding a needle in a stack of pickled cabbage.  anyways. jay asked for tips on people coming into korea. i suppose i could help all y'all... lots of people are talking about coming here.   first off, jay, camp red cloud? you're a US serviceman? i think you should brace yourself for a bit of rudeness on the part of most koreans, especially the puffy-chested young men who may attempt to inflict the pain of their taekwondo feet upon you. koreans are more consistently nationalistic and proud than most of the americans i've met, and some of them have a real hatred for foreigners, especially US servicemen. some of them just want to try and see what you're made of, it's a very competitive culture.   there's a really good thread on the www.eslcafe.com discussion board about whether or not korean men can actually fight (some can, the others pretend they can and get beat up really bad or run to their thirty friends and then the police arrest the foreigner who was most likely just defending himself).  http://www.eslcafe.com/forums/korea/index.php -just do a search about fights and you'll get tons of shit. ESL teachers are career alcoholics for the most part, therefore they're always scuffling with peacock-y koreans who are convinced of their superiority. the word seems to be that if you have a little grappling skill you'll do fine against the slaphappy taekwondo kids because all they really know how to do is kick. get in close and "gag him silly" as otis would say.    in fact, the eslcafe.com korea forums are probably good for anyone coming here, not just english teachers. there's a question and answer forum, usually any question is answered within 24 hours by the waegooks here.   first, i would learn a bit of korean. even with all the people studying english here, there sure aren't all that many who can speak it.   good phrases:  anyong-hahsae-yo "hello" kamsa-am-nida "thank you very much" yae-"yes"  (place name)-ro kajusayo "go here please" i.e. "itaewon-ro-kajusayo"  mekju jesayo-"beer please"  and when you pronounce anything ending in "dong", don't say it so it rhymes with "wrong", say it "dooung", from the back of your throat somewhat. they won't understand you.   go to kyobo bookstore, it's right near seoul city hall which has its own subway stop. find "roadmap to korean" by richard harris in the "foreigner section". it's only about 10 bucks US and a great way to learn a little korean and learn about the seemingly indecipherable array of customs related to social interaction koreans have. if you learn a few of those, your stay will be much more palatable than many foreigners'.   go for a few subway rides when you're in seoul. the subway is huge, and a really good system. you can go anywhere on it. go to yongsan market and buy electronics for 200 bucks cheaper than anywhere else in the world.   my main advice is to be as polite as humanly possible. make a korean friend or two, because after the initial ice breaking, koreans are extremely warm, generous and loyal people. i've said before, after "hello", the first thing any korean will say to you is "have you eaten?". there's a genuine concern for your well being here, due to fear of famine being a fairly recent memory for anyone over 30 here.   really, if you make a few korean friends, your life will improve immeasurably. they'll want to show you all the cool places, take you out for food (and never let you pay), teach you about their customs, and touch your leg. like i've said before, even the gay people in korea aren't gay - so leg-touching and shoulder-rubbing between men is not met with fears of homosexual activity, don't blanche if someone does it to you. often these kids are being your friend to improve their englishee, but they are being genuine too. friendship is very important to koreans and they don't just throw it around.   if you have any specific questions go ahead and email me. we can go fetch a mekju when you get to korea. you win respect if you can drink a korean under the table, so i can help you practice.   Urghttph-who are you? duct tape man is a superhero. every so often i'll come into a room, people will say "sean, where have you been, duct tape man was just here!" and i'll be like "aww, i missed him. AGAIN!" as i adjust my glasses and tie.

      people have been bugging for an update. there's not much new to tell really except for a teaching thing that happened yesterday.   i was teaching one of my two 'problem classes', full of kids just hitting puberty, full of hormones and energy. these are two classes whose students i like individually but HATE as a group. i mean i really sink down into petty hatreds of these little punks. as soon as i start talking, three of them start talking. i'll say "jo yong hihae" which startled them the first week i'd learned it but now they just keep talking. in korean.   it really throws me off, i try to start teaching about some weird idiomatic thing, and they distract me by talking. i eventually graduate to "shut up" and then attempt to kick some kid out of the class. they'll then all sit there silent, while the offending kid just stares at his or her book, refusing to leave. one time i stood over this one annoying little bitch kyoung-jin who deliberately uses disrespectful language in korean in hopes i'll find out what it is and realize how much she hates me... for like 10 minutes i just kept repeating "leave now. get out of my class. leave now" while everyone was just silent. i ended up giving up and leaving myself.   so we're talking about this one story. my classes are lighthearted, and inevitably the discussion digresses to  topics such as wrestling, PC games, handphones... korean stuff. at one point this one kid is trying to say "i am riding a bicycle" but she says "I am a bicycle!" which makes me laugh and i say back "you are a bicycle?" and don't give it a second thought, as i turn back to the two other dudes and start talking about choke-slams and pile drivers again.   about 30 seconds later, after muttering in korean, this girl starts freaking out and slamming her notebook on her desk super loud.   even if she's rightfully pissed about something, that's inappropriate. especially by korean confucian standards. in canada i'd say "What's wrong?" but in korea i'm a god so i say "get out". she sits there and just glowers at her book. koreans do see the teacher as a god, but they also hate taking shit from a foreigner... and unlike a middle school teacher, i'm not allowed to smack her.  so she knows i can't do anything but yell at her in front of the class. embarrassing for her right now but in 1/2 an hour it'll be a badge of honor.   "get out. leave the class now." i repeat this a couple of times, and then totally lose my shit because it's been a rather rough day.   "GET OUT!!!" i holler as loud as i possibly can. anyone of you who has ever attempted to give me silent treatment before has been witness to how much it enrages me... today was no exception, because the kid just sat there indignant. i lost my temper as much as i could within the boundaries of my job. i really wanted to be korean and just drill the kid in the face.   so i got up, grabbed her chair and turned it towards the door. i then said "i can always carry you out" to which the little shit stands up and stomps out.  the rest of the class is quiet and reserved. i hear monster talking to her outside the classroom. i walk out and tell him my version of what happened. she whispers in korean to monster...  he takes me aside and says "you said she was a bicycle... she is going through her... uh... change of life... right now and her voice changes, she is very shy about it. she thinks you said that she squeaks like a bicycle"  i've been involved in some pretty odd misunderstandings before, but this one takes the cake. i got monster to tell her that it was something totally unrelated to her pubescence, just to the story we were reading, about a dude practicing for a bike race. she didn't seem to take that as an explanation. or the fact that he scolded her for freaking out in class.   so i pulled her back in the class and had the job of explaining what a 'misunderstanding' was to 8 kids who really don't give a shit if they learn english... to the point where they don't want to understand what a misunderstanding or an apology is.  banging your book on the table, menarche PMS episode or not, is still inappropriate and i stand by screaming at the kid, because, well, this is korea.   if it was the US or Canada i'd probably get sued for causing nervous suffering and end up on a few daytime talk shows with right wing fruitcakes backing me up and trailer park lowest-common-denominators masquerading as person's rights advocates telling me to 'not go there' and that i am a bad person.  teaching can take a flying leap. really, the only things i'm interested in are beer, rock and roll and naked women. but that's for "sean o'leary's dirty blog" which may or may not exist, ma.

      seoul. seoul is grand. for those of you who got my group email, you know my motivations for my visit to seoul; they will unfold in the months to come. if you're reading this blog and you're curious what said motivations are, send me an email.  first, after honing my 'attack', i took a lengthy subway journey to yongsan market, a crazy place where you can buy ridiculously discounted audio/visual/computer gadgetry. i got myself a canon S50 digital camera with an extra 128 mb memory card for 550,000 won. that's about 550 bucks. i'm pretty sure that after taxes, the same package would be about 650 canadian bucks. but who knows. actually, dell.ca is selling it for 750 dollars CDN. holy shit. shitty thing is i need a voltage converter for it, it's made for the japanese market, and they have the same kinds of plugs as we do in canada.   next was a trip to "lotte world" and for those of you who waded through my "political economy" post you'd know just how much big corporations permeate life here. well lotte, the big food company, has this crazy indoor vegas-like amusement park. it has a rollercoaster that monster, six of the hagwon kids and myself decided to go on four times. given that queues are generally a little more intense in asia, it was a bit tiresome standing around. there are no chiropractors in this country, so i felt like shit at the end of the evening. plus i swear the place is made of bird flu. they were going to try concrete and drywall but they decided on bird flu.   but my theory with rollercoasters is that they're too damn short. you spend an hour waiting in line for 1.5 minutes of speed and loops. that's why i'm going to invent the ALL DAY rollercoaster. you get on, and 8 hours later your soul is fully cleansed of iniquity. ALL DAY ROLLERCOASTER. and i thought BABY HUNT was a good band name...  the real fish bone in my craw about this trip was the jim-jil-bang, the public bathhouse. now a bathhouse is a good idea. it's  public shower/sauna/hot spring thing right in the city. it's relaxing as hell after schlepping around seoul for a day and getting lost 3 times on the subway.   then i found out we weren't sleeping in a hotel, we were sleeping in the dorm rooms at the jim-jil-bang. which is fine i guess. it's warm, you get clean pillows and stuff. korean floors are padded as hell and the heating comes from pipes under the floor. why bitch at midnight when monster has kept you up pretty much the whole night before (see last post)? so i go have myself  hottub sit with a bunch of other naked dudes, take a nice shower, wonder if i'm burning any retinae with my caucasian-ness... and retire to the sleeping room.   korean men snore.   oh my god, do they snore. like wildebeests with asthma.  there were about 20 men in the room that was about the size of 4 living rooms. about 5 of them were snoring so loud that wadded up toilet paper and 2 pillows over my head didn't help. once again, i got about 3 hours of sleep.   then i woke up to find that the "genius" of korean technology, the heated floor, had given me a nice first-degree burn on my left hip. i always sleep on my left side, and i guess the heat was so high it burnt my skin through the quilt-mattress that hannah claimed "was so good for your back". what a crock.   yeah so the jim-jil-bang is another part of korean culture that should be experienced... but once you've experienced it, you can truly live without it. if i want another mineral bath i'll sprinkle epsom salts on my arse in the shower.   the rest of the day was spent trying to ditch monster and the kids (who i actually really like). seoul is great... i can't wait to live there, hee hee hee (rubs hands together evilly).  i finally got to hook up with my good buddy mr. lee, one of the kindest people i've ever met. we had some beers, ramyun and soju and a bunch of good conversation.   and now i'm back in andong planning something sinister that will hopefully end with tragedy for some and comedy for others.

      monster needs to be murdered. seriously, just kill him in his sleep. euthanize him, because anyone as repugnant as him should be considered terminally ill.   he gets home at 4am from who-the-fuck-knows where, madame kim's hummer hut or the ka-chee-no... i dunno. he promptly turns on the TV super loud. it's about a foot from my head. did i mention that korean houses are not insulated?  anyways, i get up at about 5:30 to take a piss and he says "oh, sorry sean. is TV too loud?" and i say "yeah".   about 10 minutes later, he's snoring louder than the TV. i have an important 'appoinment' in seoul today and my bottom eyelids look like i just did 10 rounds with tank abbott. i have dark circles under my eyes on a good day when i haven't had a beer in a week and i've had 8 hours of sleep.   umm yeah. i should have stabbed him.   LIVE THE DREAM, STAB YOUR BOSS.  what's worse is i'm in a PC room and these two korean dudes are arguing. some girl is humping this game of online tetris, pounding the keys of her computer with such alacrity it's like she's saving her children from the jaws of a lion... another guy is listening to this cover version of "last christmas" by WHAM! except they've put a harmonizer on the singer's vocals so she sounds like alvin and the chipmunks.   adults listen to this music. ADULTS. starcraft is a popular sport over here. i mean people make a million canadian dollars a year playing professional starcraft. PC game pros. sometimes the culture shock just won't quit.   i'm buying a digital camera today. canon IXUS 400 (korean version of the digital ELPH) or supershot s50?

      i just spent some money. i bought an 80 dollar shirt, 15 dollar fake gap khakis and 20 dollar licensed doc martens.   showed some photos to my students, they saw a picture of my parents' front yard and were in awe of the size of it...   "TEACHA.... ARE YOU RICH?!?!?!?"  they must be screwed in the head because they saw one photo of my brother mark and said "oooh, he is a handsome man".  not to mention the "ooooh... stone cold steve austin" reaction of pretty much every student who saw a photo of my dad.  also, my package from greg bennick arrived. "sean, here's some CDs, a magazine, two movie posters and a drawing of four dicks".   because of greg, i can stroll placidly around andong listening to slayer. it's amazing how much you miss a record after hearing it at least once a week for about 13 years...  Trapped in purgatory A lifeless object, alive Awaiting reprisal Death will be their acqueisence  The sky is turning red Return to power draws near Fall into me, the sky's crimson tears Abolish the rules made of stone  Pierced from below, souls of my treacherous past Betrayed by many, now ornaments dripping above  Awaiting the hour of reprisal Your time slips away  Raining blood From a lacerated sky Bleeding its horror Creating my structure Now I shall reign in blood.   ahh, slayer. they're like a cup of warm cocoa. so comforting. nothing comes close.

      email from cam sylvester, old family friend and one of those community college instructors who teaches you more in 3 months than 8 lazy, tenured fruitcakes or 800 tense-as-shit UBC sessionals could have taught you in 2 years at UBC:       |  |  | Inbox       Sean, Sounds wild and wonderful.  THe Koreans have chaebols, but they are basically the same things as zaibatsu.  BTW, don't let your cultural sensitivity stop you if you see something that goes against your inner core, like a guy beating up his girlfriend.  Even in a culturally relevant world you need to hold on to what's true to you. Cam  so yeah, it's the same thing as a zaibatsu. it seemed too similar to be anything but. and the real reason i didn't intervene was not the dong-dong-ju or beer making me lazy, it was the fact that there were 6 korean cops nearby who would likely have arrested me instead of the girl-beatin' asshole.

      so now that i've been paid, a real load has been lifted from my mind. some of you have expressed genuine concern for my sanity, and apart from the gurgly feeling in my gut about not getting paid, things are alright.   i realized that with all my bitching, party stories and assertions of western superiority, i haven't even said a word about andong. and that is truly a crime.   andong is about the size of vernon, but with a population of 120,000. the city is actualy alot like vernon, kind of in a valley but with a big river running through it. there's a whole bunch of historical sites around here, old restored villages that are from as early as the 1300s. really cool.   if you have zero interest in my synthesis of personal experience and political studies 100, stop reading here and start re-reading at the next dotted line.  --------  korea in general is polar opposite to canada. it's very confucian, and from my understanding, confucianism dictates a top-down power structure with an infallible male monarch at the top, and the relationships between individuals are governed upon lines of age and gender, with older, male people being of superior rank to younger and female people. therefore, if you were to draw some chart with the benevolent dictator at the very top, lower ranks would cascade down in a series of triangles. you do not question your rank, and you do exactly what you're told by the higher rank. it would be a good system if the people in higher ranks weren't perenially full of shit. people in power tend to be in most cases.   confucian countries - china, korea, taiwan basically. singapore too.   china? a crazy place with more problems than i could even hope to comprehend. fascinating, but if someone in power there sneezes or farts, 100,000 people die. i think it's why their switch to communism was so brutal - chairman mao as supreme leader of a zillion people with centuries of confucian baggage - only with rhetoric of equality for all and destruction of the bourgeois class... i think marx and engels had a decidedly more peaceful transfer of power in mind.   taiwan? polluted as shit. korea? polluted as shit, a bit xenophobic, and corruption runs absolutely rampant in the business and government communities. i've been here for a month and the cover stories of the korean times have EVERY DAY, i shit you not, had something about a government, NGO or big business official resigning. cash grabs, payoffs... i think gordon campbell should get a job here.   the reason for this is, in my understanding, the zaibatsu;   http://www.bartleby.com/65/za/zaibatsu.html  zaibatsus were formerly monied gentry or some shit like that... then during the rebuilding of korea and japan after their respective war experiences, the zaibatsus became somewhat integrated into the government. government and big business operate here in a way that could be thought of as conflict of interest back home - they truly massage each other, and it is acceptable. government promotes and actively manipulates big business to stimulate the economy - and make rich dudes richer. trickle-down economics, confucian style.   i heard a story about there being a holiday in japan - and it sounds way too silly to be true, but it would make sense with a sort of zaibatsu relationship in place - but on this holiday, everyone puts their old (1 year old, it's a yearly event) stereo/AV gear out on their doorstep and gets a subsidy to buy new stereo/AV gear. the girl i heard talking about it said her friend, who was teaching in japan at the time, just walked down the street picking up stereo gear that was still totally useable, destined for the garbage dump. free shit. recycling never crossed anyone's mind and as todd flintstone http://todd.digiplebes.com says, japan has the highest per capita garbage incinerators in the world. could be part of the reason asia has a "brown cloud" over it. it sure as hell ain't my farts though i try.   from what i can see, korea has a similar relationship as japan's; the major zaibatsu-style corporations - and there's really only about 10 corporations in korea that have any great weight - are samsung, hyundai, lotte, and LG. did you know samsung made cars? i didn't. it's crazy. i have seen a grand total of two non-korean cars here, which leads me to believe that there is an insane import duty on them - monster even told me it costs about 120,000 to buy an audi A6 here, i believe they're about 40,000 back home. john? am i right? anyways, it's also weird, there's a million cars here, and i've never seen one more than ten years old. i've seen one hyundai pony, in seoul. remember them? this could be for two reasons - somewhat of a zaibatsu in place, with koreans being either helped or urged to buy new cars to promote the economy, or perhaps, since the economy here was in the absolute shitter about 10 years ago, maybe the idea of everyone having a car is rather recent.   it's a weird transition for me, coming from vancouver where you can't fart without hitting someone who rants about corporate rule and big business being in the pocket of government and/or vice versa. corporations here are omnipresent, and no-one bats an eyelash. of course - it's confucian. don't question ANYTHING, just shut up and work and die. oh and be sure to get married while you're at it.   my friend mr. lee lives in a samsung apartment block. samsung owns and manages apartments, as does hyundai and they ARE ALL IDENTICAL. there is very little architectural difference in korea at all, and it's pretty surreal. i live in a hyundai apartment. i used to think it was ugly but for some reason the utilitarian quality of it is growing on me a little. just a little though.   a korean's socialization is guided by a few things. one is a real fear that korea is going to be taken over - either by the communists, the USA, Japan, or foreign english teachers. imagine that... a bunch of alcoholics staging a coup... but seriously, there's that sort of xenophobia, also confucianism, a serious national pride - very few koreans seem to think leaving korea is a good idea, even on holiday - and a sense that corporations have rebuilt the country after the war and they are the reason for any comfort koreans have now.   i think this is the reason steve tried to talk me out of intervening when that moron was slapping his girlfriend; it's likely i would have looked a lot like douglas macarthur to the guy and if i implored him to not hit his girl all he would have heard was "YOU COMMIE JAP CHINAMEN... MAKE BIGGER CARS, STOP EATING ALL THAT RICE AND MAKE YOURSELVES SOME HAMBURGER SANDWICHES!!! WE SHOULD HAVE NUKED YOU IN 'NAM!!!". so it's a good thing i held back i suppose.   food is important here - after years and years of near famine in many places, koreans have it pretty good, but still, the second thing anyone says to you after "hello" is "have you eaten?" and it is of grave concern to them. as is marriage. people find out i'm 32 and say "oh my god, are you married yet?!?" because if you hit 30 and you're unmarried, you are a pitiable screwup who is either bankrupt, socially inept or gay. but nobody's gay here. even the gay people i think.   i try to explain "i'm not married because bitches is mental" but they don't understand.   i think this should be the end of the lecture. i'm probably only half right on a lot of it anyways.  ------  food here is amazing. here's a synopsis:  danjiang - korean miso soup. it has a similar taste to japanese miso but it's less finely crushed so the end result is a salty lentil soup-type mixture, usually with peppers, dooboo (tofu), onions, and these really awesome korean wild greens that are kinda like fiddleheads.   chop-cheh - a noodle dish, usually with pork but i try my hardest to nix that. it's fried in sesame oil.  go din ah - (sp?) salted mackerel. an andong specialty, they're a major exporter of godinah. usually barbecued or oven broiled. so salty, so tasty.   and bibimbab (rice bowl) and soondooboo (soft tofu stew) are staples. it's the wild greens that make everything so damn good.   beer? hite, OB and cass. hite has a stout that is like vancouver island hermann's dark lager, otherwise korean beers are usually passable asian lagers. OB is my fave, it's kinda german tasting. cass is the most common draft, and it's ok tasting but it comes with massive hangovers installed and serviced, no matter how much you drink.   stay away from soju and dongdong ju, it makes you feel like a wizard but the next day you're reduced to something akin to smeagol... seriously heinous shit.   that's about it. i think i just wanted to let everyone know that, despite my stress of late, i am having a really good time here. i wanted to have at least one positive-sounding blog update...   and dave alexandre... ph.d. student or no, you are not smart. BRUCE ALMIGHTY is the SHIT! of course, god doesn't look like the dude from the shawshank redemption, HE LOOKS LIKE GANDALF! I CAN PROVE IT! so it does have that one flaw. and the sappy god and romance shit at the end. plus jennifer anus-town is an annoying bong-voiced nerd. but BRUCE ALMIGHTY IS THE SHIT!!!   can you tell that with an extreme lack of movie choices that my taste is adapting in a rather negative way?

      it's d-day mark II. let's see if monster throws down. if he doesn't, he'll be breaking his third promise. that's the camel's back right there. the smallest amount i'll take from the shit-apple is 1 million won. he owes me 1.5 but 1 million will show me he's at least half way to being a regular businessman who pays his employees. i'll update after work to tell you whether or not i'm showing up tomorrow.   and here's a few bitches. i got a crappy sleep last night, so i'm in an uncommonly crabby mood. cultural relativism is going out the freakin' window today, and i'm going to be a westerner with a superiority complex for, oh, five minutes.   1. korean pop music is the worst thing in the world. by far. i really think skrewdriver is less of a crime. what's worse is the shit that accompanies online games in korea - the kids don't seem to notice they've heard the same crappy version of the backstreet boys 800 times in an hour. super loud. (i'm in a PC room).  2. the asian habit of hawking up phlegm is, while maybe a good idea, completely nauseating. i wake up EVERY MORNING to monster doing it in the kitchen sink. what's worse, he has his own style where he makes this ridiculously loud vomiting noise before he hawks up his oyster. so every morning... "HWWWWWOOOAARGH... HWWWRAAAAAWWWWK... HWWRAAWWWRK.... *ptooey*". it's truly savage.   3. the sewers here are gross and only about 6 inches below the road.   i'm a whiner but for the last five minutes i've been RIGHT.

      i think it's going to be impossible to go for too long in this country without a decent fight story. mark and danielle are leaving to travel the world, so we drank numerous jugs of beer and three people got extremely drunken overseas birthday phone calls from me. i sure hope i didn't cuss when i was on the phone to meaghan who is now 11 and one of the best people in the world.   anyways we're drinking and since mark's leaving he has to get rid of the fireworks he accumulated while in the 'dong. so they all go down to the street and start shooting roman candles in the air. i stay inside because it's colder than a witch's booty.   from the window we see these 10 or so korean teenage boys walk past mark, and purposely step in the way of the fireworks as if to say "why are you shooting roman candles at me, waegook?" and they get all pissed off and start getting in mark's face.   mark is a mellow, friendly little man but he's also a hapkido dude and a bit of a wrecker. everyone else is much larger than these taegookie fruit baskets who are each about 65 pounds soaking wet. this one drunk bozo starts shrieking "you go, you get out! go away from here! police will come!" and everyone starts laughing at them. this exacerbates the rage of the soju rebels who start a chest-puffing teenage display of drunken bravery that only serves to make us laugh harder. i go outside just in case there's a chance i can stick my face in the way of a flying foot, but it ended without a scuffle.   it was just funny, buddy was freaking out and his friend was trying to play the peacemaker in broken english "you go away from here now... my friend angry" and it was just like some bad movie. yeah your friend's angry, dipshit, but he's smaller than my cat and he needs a quick trip to detox.   yeah, not a really good fight story, but funny enough. you kinda had to be there. kinda reminded me of the story of sean lande and the turkish gangster kids in germany... "fuck your muzzer!!! fuck your family!!!"... except these dudes were just a bunch of drunk xenophobic ESL shitheads, not crazy german ghetto locs who'd bust ein cap in mein hinde.   i don't think they have detox centers in korea. i think they'd see it as some sort of high treason.

      oh, one more thing. i heard a crazy rumor that "josh gay" of seattle, WA is quite enamored with the second greatest sex - more specifically, he engages in lurid, nude relations with other men. not that there's anything wrong with that, in fact i'm quite proud of him for being so open about it. i just thought the world should know. josh gay, here's to you. kudos!

      today i get an email from the legendary otis:  "I would kick monster's ass, or any of his henchmen,I could also teach  some fucked up english.HA!HA! If they pay shit money they get shit english, EH! I'm glad to be there with you in spirit. I will be thinking of you all the best in what ever you decide to do.Otis"  next time you talk to otis, get him to tell you the one about the two newfie girls he met in australia who had been teaching english in korea...  something about "two-fer where ye at baaay" not being in the korean-english dictionary...   also, i watched a drunk korean dude slap his girlfriend around really bad last night from a table in a restaurant. i went outside to try to break it up and if you've seen any of the scars on my face and my chipped tooth you'll know how well my peacemaking efforts have gone in the past. i shouted at him and in my half-cut state i was probably going to offer my face as his next target, but the police got to him before i did. steve, one of the andong foreigners was just shaking his head as if to say "you've only been in korea a month, haven't you". shit like that happens all the time. a man can hit a woman, nobody will do shit.   what's more, if you're older than someone you can slap them around and not get in trouble. it's technically illegal, but nobody will do shit about it.   monster says he's older than me, 33. thing is, koreans count their ages differently. when a western kid pops outta his mom, he's 0 years old. koreans are 1 year old when they pop outta their moms.   therefore, i'm at least 6 or 7 months older than monster if i count my age korean style. he isn't even allowed to raise his voice to me.   a small comfort, but a funny one. maybe i will beat him up.   another thing worthy of mention: after not getting paid in full on thursday, i taught a whole lesson on shit and barf. the kids here seem as obsessed with bodily functions as i am, they're always drawing pictures of "doong" underneath the pictures of animals in their work books. so after not getting paid, i decided "what the hell, let's change the curriculum a bit". i taught everything from clinical words like "feces","vomit" and "diahrrea" to "kaka", "poo", "barf" and other stuff. it was brilliant. shit, if those kids ever get to canada, the states or england, they're gonna need real survival skills. so i gave them survival skills. next i'll give them weed and scotch. i'm the best teacher in the world.

      ok so this morning's got me feeling a little homesick. i woke up with a hell of a lot of thought going around in my head... like more thought than normal. is there a unit of measurement for thought? gigathoughts?  firstly, i think it is crucial to pay heed to the teachings of one of the world's great social theorists, tony "otis" williamson of kelowna via st. john NB. "LIVE THE DREAM, PUNCH YOUR BOSS". almost daily he would berate me with that whilst being nagged to take shorter breaks and clean just one more window like we didn't ever get the job done anyways.   i got paid 400,000 won. 400 measly dollars. "oh sean, i have money problems this month. you endure, please".   to which i replied "that's just not acceptable. i didn't come to korea for a holiday, i came to make money. if you don't pay me, i have to take some sort of action".   he waffles a bit because he knows i have the upper hand. "well, sean, you know we really love you here, the students love you, we don't want to have same problem as mark and steve, they leaving before contract is finish".  i think i scared him as much as some wet-behind-the-ears snow mexican can scare a manipulative, pushy bitch. "this is what needs to happen. you need to pay me the full amount by monday, or i have to take measures to ensure my own safety".   at which point he started doing his "over-friendly boss" thing where he pats my shoulder and it feels like i'm on my hands and knees in the confessional like a 9-year-old residential school choirboy... "sean you don't worry, you listen to mark, monty, steve, they all crazy, they think i am bad guy".  "mr. kim, at this point i have as much reason to believe them and bill (who is getting dicked around too, his outstanding shit is supposedly going to be paid a month from now) as i have to believe you" and he shut up, we talked about basic banking stuff and he agreed to give me 200,000 today and the remaining 1.3 million on monday. i told him "i'm helping my parents pay their mortgage and finance the renovation of their house" which is a decidedly confucian value that gave him much reason to believe that I NEED TO BE PAID.   it sucks that bill didn't work for the PHS, it's astonishing how good my bullshit-detecting skills have developed. "oh, he just wants to go up to gary's room to get his jacket!". yes, i believe you. i'd like to see balogh the warden deal with my boss. it'd be funny.   like i have to justify that shit. my job is to show up, teach english, and not open my mouth. his job is to PAY ME. not blow my fucking paycheck at "ka-chee-no" or the whorehouse.   so, well, i may be in taiwan by the time my next blog update occurs.   again, don't worry about me. i still have enough money to fly the coop, and while this is an insulting waste of my time, i have developed a really mellow perspective on this whole boondoggle.   1. i got fed and housed and even clothed (he gave me a bathrobe) in a foreign country for a month. not cheap, even in korea. 2. i had fun, made some new friends and learned how to get around korea. 3. i got some valuable job experience, and learned alot of how to govern myself in a classroom and how to deal with a bunch of spoiled, shrieking fruitcake children.   so in that respect, i've come out on top. i've wasted a month doing stupider shit, and as far as personal trauma goes, i wouldn't trade this month for a month living with meredith mitchell and her piss-happy cats. i wouldn't trade this for getting my tongue bit  off by aaron brown. i wouldn't trade this month for any month working at the t-shirt factory or at ace window cleaners. i wouldn't trade this for any month i spent unemployed.   the only reason this is a real pain in the ass is that i want to be flying across cambodia and vietnam on my OWN motorcycle (not a rental) by this time next year. this is just an obstacle for the plan and for that reason i should LIVE THE DREAM, PUNCH MY BOSS.   otis is a genius, everyone should spend at least an hour with otis before they leave this mortal coil. if he gets his own TV show like we planned, you may just get that chance.   some other updates:  i was vegetarian for a good ten years. i started eating fish again during an ill-advised sojourn on cortes island, and that was a wise decision since fish don't feel shit when you bonk 'em so who cares. now i'm in korea and it's pretty impossible to avoid accidentally eating meat because they crank it into EVERYTHING. i don't dislike the taste of meat, so i just pull a 'when in rome' attitude because it's highly rude to be picking shit out of your mouth as you eat or leaving bits of food on your plate. i'm big on manners.   so anyways, in a month i've probably eaten a full meat based meal, by accident or out of politeness. i had an all-you-can-eat joint in okdong recommended to me. i get there, and it's one of those korean barbecue joints. i walk in, and think about walking out because i see the big long line of meat. i think for a second, and decide aw, "who cares? let's try seeing how the stupid half lives". so i sat down, filled my plate up with fresh beef, lamb and chicken. slapped that shit on the grill, and cooked myself a really tasty feast with samjang, lettuce wraps, garlic and onions, kimchi and dried fish. i ate a lot and it was really quite delicious. then i met yong-tak for a couple of pints at the wa bar.   so now it's morning. i don't think there's any irony in the fact that, given my diet over the last 24 hours and my boss' dipshittery that i woke up with ICE CUBE playing in my head.   "Went to mom's house and dropped a load in the bathroom... Jumped back in my low rider, Comin out feelin about ten pounds lighter... Went to Bone's house so I can get the gat, Looking for the place where all the hoes kick it at" steady mobbin', from the 1991 album "death certificate"  for a compelling argument for "why one should not eat meat", try eating meat sometime. i feel like homemade shit right now and could stand to lose about ten pounds if the shit would just MOVE. anyone got some exaraxxa?  ICE CUBE also raps a lot about getting paid in that song. "i'm out ta get rich, cause life ain't nothin' but money and..." oh yeah, my mom reads this blog. or, how about "stopped givin' juice to the raiders, 'cause al davis never paid us... i hope he's wearin' a vest"...   shitty thing is, there's no guns in this country.   what else? meaghan, if your mom has let you read this far... well if she hasn't she's a hypocrite because she swears like a sailor in prison, happy birthday kiddo. i haven't got you anything yet because i haven't figured out what 'store that sells stuff that kids like' is in korean. but expect a package soon.   happy birthday to john and hannah too. happy valentine's day everyone. sorry for the long update but i think the shit i ate last night is now exerting pressure on some part of my brain that makes me run off at the mouth.

      bill got paid today. he was owed 2.9 million won.   he was paid 150,000 won.  i get paid in two days. i suppose i do not need to tell you that various forms of matter are churning in my lower intestine.   also-i found out some bad news. if i want to stay in korea, i have to stick it out until may.  here is the reason: i have no E2 visa. you absolutely must have the real copy of your degree IN HAND when you go to apply for work here. wonny and the girls pulled some strings, and no doubt the fact i'm working at a shit hagwon is because i am quasi-legal. well, illegal. so, if i bail on monster, i can't work anywhere else in korea, for fear he'll report me to immigration.   so, what will happen is this. i will stick it out until my degree arrives in may. i can't receive it until may, though i've completed all the requirements, processing and shit. i am certain that i will get paid in full at least for this month, he doesn't want me to pull a midnight run.   so if i get paid shit for the next three months after that, i'll still have about 4 grand in the bank to go do what i want with. when my degree arrives, i can get any job in korea. i either have to bail to japan or taiwan or eat shit for 3 months.   more later. i'll tell y'all what happened with bill and my payday on wednesday night.

      so i met steve last night, another former REI employee. he took me aside and BEGGED me to 'f**k monster over before he f**ks you". censored for the benefit of the younger readers.   bill was promised an advance of 300,000 won (about 300 bucks). monster said "i transferred the money on wednesday", and tonight bill was unable to access the funds. bill is at his wits' end, monster owes him 3 million. he has promised to pay him on the 9th; my payday is on the 12th. so who knows if he's going to have the 1.9 million he will owe me on that day?   so yeah, i'm still packed and ready to go. well not packed to the point where monster would get suspicious, but ready to pack. it'll take me all of 15 minutes.

      a few new developments:  1. i asked for my own apartment. mr. kim looked a little flustered and then said he'd take care of it sometime in march. i asked for march 1, he said that may be possible. we'll see. this whole thing is a waiting game and it's getting kind of annoying since nobody waits for my ass around here. i'm on time, i fulfill my end of the bargain, i teach kids to speak english, i'm an hour early for work every day.   it's annoying as hell because i don't get the privacy i'm used to. not that i enjoy walking around in the buff, but i could do that in my last home if i wanted to. his five year old son will just walk into my room without knocking on a saturday morning. plus, mr. kim gets up every morning and makes these disgusting hawking sounds into the toilet. it's 6 feet from my head.   according to jay, mark and lex i am the only english teacher in korea living with his director. it's been tolerable at best but it has to come to an end. if i'm going to be wakened by a five year old on a saturday, it's going to be MY five year old, then i can BEAT said five year old.   2. i found a chocolate bar called "CRUNKY" in home mart yesterday. for those of you uninitiated, "crunk" is the first shit of the day. "crunky" is also what they're calling that deep south hiphop. not funky but crunky.   3. i talked to lex spahr on the phone last night. more foreign friends, more allies. perhaps i will visit masan soon.    i'm still poised and ready to leave this place if i don't get paid, in full, on the 12th. other than that, i'm subject to a few discomforts but in general okay.

      so the other night i'm in my advanced class...  there's these two hyperactive genius kids, spencer and joon. we had a discussion group, and the open topic shifted to world war 2.   spencer: " would like to be hitler, bad guys are cool, like sauron..." sean-teacher: "well, be careful with what you say, sauron is fantasy, hitler was real and did real bad things to innocent people" joon: "LIKE WHAT? DID HE CUT PEOPLES' HEADS OFF? really, teacher, how did he torture people? i like torture" (rubbing his hands and acting all psycho, like 11 year olds do).  sean-teacher: "well, you can read books on that, joon. we're not talking about it here"  spencer: "ahh, torture. if i was hitler, i would just make them chew on the tinfoil".

      so "me talk pretty one day" by david sedaris is an essential piece of literature. it's a misanthropic slab of post-1950s dead american dream written by a gay third-generation greek american chainsmoking ex-crystal meth head.  an excerpt - context, sedaris is currently in paris studying french from someone who hates anyone who can't speak french:  -------------  The Italian nanny was attempting to answer the teacher's question when the Moroccan student interrupted:  "Excuse me, but what' s an Easter?"  It would seem to me that despite growing up in a Muslim country, she would have heard it mentioned once or twice, but no. "I mean it", she said. "I have no idea what you are talking about".  The teacher called upon the rest of us to explain.  The Poles led the charge to the best of their ability. "It is", said one, "a party for the little boy of God who call his self jesus and.... oh, shit." She faltered and her fellow countrymen came to her aid. "He calls his self jesus and then he die one day on two... morsels of... lumber."  The rest of the class jumped in, offering bits of information that would have given the pope an aneurysm.  "He die one day and then he go above of my head to live with your father"  "He weared of himself the long hair and after he die, the first day he come back here for to say hello to the peoples."  "He nice, the Jesus."  "He make the good things, and on the Easter we be sad because somebody makes him dead today."  Part of the problem had to do with vocabulary. Simple nouns such as cross and ressurection were beyond our grasp, let alone such complicated reflexive phrases as "to give of yourself your only begotten son". Faced with the challenge of explaining the cornerstone of Christianity, we did what any self-respecting group of people might do. We talked about food instead.   "Easter is a party for to eat of the lamb," the Italian nanny explained. "One too may eat of the chocolate".  "And who brings the chocolate?" the teacher asked.  I knew the word, so I raised my hand, saying "The rabbit of Easter. He bring of the chocolate."  "A rabbit?" The teacher, assuming I'd used the wrong word, positioning her index fingers on top of her head, wriggling them as though they were ears. "You mean one of these? a 'rabbit' rabbit?"  "Well, sure," I said. "He come in the night when one sleep on a bed. With a hand he have a basket and foods."  The teacher sighed and shook her head. As far as she was concerned, I had just explained everything that was wrong with my country. "No, no," she said. "Here in France the chocolate is broght by a big bell that flies in from Rome."  I called for a time out. "But how the hell do the bell know where you live?"  "Well," she said, "how does a rabbit?"  It was a decent point, but at least a rabbit has eyes. That's a start. Rabbits move from place to place, while most bells go back and forth - and they can't even do that of their own power. On top of that, the Easter Bunny has character. He's someone you'd like to meet and shake hands with.   A bell has all the personality of a cast-iron skillet. It's like saying that come Christmas, a magic dustpan flies in from the North Pole, led by eight flying cinder blocks. Who wants to stay up all night so they can see a bell? And why fly one in from Rome when thy've got more bells than they know what to with right here in Paris? That's the most implausible aspect of the whole story, as there's no way the bells of France would allow a foreign worker to fly in and take their jobs. That Roman bell would be lucky to get work cleaning up after a French bell's dog - and even then he'd need papers. It just didn't add up.  ------------ end quote. sorry i got all reader's digest on your asses, but this book has been making me laugh. the FSL assessment of the whole ressurection story is important because it helps accentuate the fact that the bible is about as much a sane cornerstone of a modern belief system as STAR WARS. i mean at least in star wars they could cut someone in half with a lazer beam and move shit with their minds. that shit was cool.

      so i was super sick last night. as i was doing my blog update i started feeling worse and worse. i had been feeling bad earlier, i only drank five beer the night before but i thought i had one of those time-release hangovers or something. so i get home, shit my intestines and take a nap. then i wake up and make some fried rice because it's 8pm and i haven't eaten anything yet.  i get to the PC bang and check my email just because i'm feeling like crap but want to get out of the apart-uh, and after about an hour of talking to barbe about why i am critical of the band THREE INCHES OF BLOOD i get up to leave. the door shuts behind me, i projectile vomit all over the lobby of the place.   i walk back in, say a weak "yogyo" and the girl comes back. i do my best sign language to indicate that i need a mop or something, she comes back with a roll of TOILET PAPER. so i'm dabbing a rather large pool of puke with a mass of toilet paper, and then i have to carry it up a flight of stairs to the bathroom. what's more, i puked about 3 times in the bathroom after my initial volcano of vomit so i had to wipe up in there too.   i then went home and was up until 4am with a fever and diahrrea.   gabe mantle said i talk too much about poo, but hey, it kinda dominates my life these days.

      so i found some real evidence of skateboarding in seoul, right near dongdaemun market. there's this plaza at the korea institute of worldly wealth or some school like that, about 12 guys were flippin' shit streetstyle. there were four 30' long hubba-style ledges that were about 2 feet high, a nice stair drop, and kids had brought some flat bars and a metal framed funbox. cops were all over, it's right near seoul police headquarters, and it seemed nobody gave a shit.   one kid was doing some pretty sweet frontside crooks on the box, another dude who looked like a US serviceman was rocking some 360 flips. it was good times. i would have got some photos but my digicamera has this weird time delay i can't figure out, so it sucks for action shots.   i'm sick as hell, shooting out both ends. the kind of thing that leaves after 12 hours but i feel like homemade shit right now. drinking gatorade to stay hydrated. it really sucked getting sick on the subway, being 20 minutes from home while trying to play dodge-uma with all the pushy ajumas on the subway.

      so i feel like a fraud, i feel naked... i'm not rocking the NERD HOOK! and i can't seem to find one anywhere in korea. i will lose my keys, i will also not feel like a fashion trailblazer. because how many people started rocking the nerd-hook after i did?  dave macdonald who is old enough to make his own style but knows a good idea when he sees one. nick berry who is wise beyond his years mike mattinson who is as crazy as i am  they're like 1.50 at army and navy. a little 1" or more brass hook with a swivel. you've no doubt seen one hooked to the pocket of my jeans. if you can get me one and send it to me, i will email you my address.  see i bought one of those cheap quasi-carabiners that all the hippies have clipped to their backpacks - not for rock climbing but for clipping shit on your backpack. it's so so little when i need so much more. i feel i could break it in half with my teeth, and if i used it as a weapon it would mess me up more than my victim.

      so i figure that since i'm still in seoul and nobody has come to kneecap me like a dude who's run afoul of the IRA then i'm safe enough to do an update.   i've been teaching in the new school for about a week now, filling in for a teacher who has gone to thailand for 2 weeks. it's good, no class bigger than five students, and there's an actual curriculum. monster's technique was to throw you in a room with 7-9 students, some of whom were of different levels, give you a couple of crappy books, and then let you wing it.   this school is different. they force you to adhere to a set time structure, you have to actually accomplish certain things with your 2 hour block, you test and give homework. you also have to wear a shirt and tie. but, i have MY OWN APARTMENT.   my own apartment. i never, ever have to wake up to hear monster scraping the inside of his lungs for phlegm to leave in the sink, i never have to be woken up by his mewling little brat walking into my room without knocking at 9am...  i'm just outside of apkujeong, which people call "the beverly hills of korea". it doesn't feel like beverly hills... more like a korean kitsilano. and with the korean approach to city planning and sewer works, it's not exactly a gated community.   what's cool about apkujeong is that i'm about 3-6 subway stops from most major centers of seoul, like dongdaemun, itaewon, namdaemun and seoul station/city hall. therefore i can get anything i want for super cheap. i bought some clothes for super cheap, a billabong shirt that would be about 70 bucks back home was only 13,000 won (about 15 bucks). since a lot of the skateboard industry has its manufacturing done in korea, we get lots of hand-me-down stuff. i saw a pair of Es arto saari shoes for 60 bucks. it's pretty alright.   i have a feeling this blog is going to get boring without the anti-monster shenanigans of the past. i really have had little to say lately, except that seoul is HUGE and look at the photos to prove it.   i guess it's just best to say i'm in a good, stable situation and will be here for a year at least, saving for a year of travelling in asia.

      monster is changing the name of his school.   what a genius.   to what, i don't know. it's like taking the "fried" out of "kentucky fried chicken" and naming your school "KFC-KOREAN FRIED CHILDREN" or something.

      more otis wisdom  SEAN said ". i hope that my leaving causes a mass exodus of students, and his school goes bankrupt. "   OTIS said " I had  a similar feeling when I quit ACE"   not that dave macdonald is a scam artist, or a whoremaster with a gambling problem and halitosis that could kill roaches...

      first day in the new school, met some nice peeps, had some intensive training.   'tis a totally pro operation, with an actual curriculum. kids go in there not speaking english and come out speaking english.   it made me realize something. REI andong rode on the coattails of two really good students, heun mook and lisa. they had the highest test scores of any kids in andong, and monster used them and foreign teachers as signs of prestige. thing is, these 2 kids learned english of their own accord, not because of anything he did. he set up the most bare-bones welfare curriculum, made both naive foreigners and andong parents believe it was STATE OF THE ART and watched the money roll in.  he's a brilliant scam artist... he's got a few people fooled.   what sucks is that the korean teachers he has working for him, all extremely good teachers, are suffering under the fact that he has such a shoddy curriculum, and some of them haven't been paid since JANUARY. and they can't say shit, he's older than them.   i am shaking my head. i'm just glad i took the money and ran. i have 2000 dollars in hand, and he can't do shit about it. i got confirmation from mark 'the molester' that monster is on the outs with immigration and they're wise to his dipshittery. mark speaks korean... when he phoned them they told him that monster didn't do a single thing immigration-wise when he ran. AND HE WAS A CHILD MOLESTER!!!  now if only he'll stop bugging my recruiters. he phoned one of them at 3am the other day. his bullying tactics are the final impotent strategies of a bully, a liar and a thief who's been found out. i hope that my leaving causes a mass exodus of students, and his school goes bankrupt.

      i just had a pint of guinness.   it was in a seoul irish pub called - get this - "O'Kim's".  it cost me 18,540 won. that's 21 canadian dollars. it felt like lotion on dry skin, but that import duty made said pint of guinness the most expensive drink i have ever purchased. there were also 190 dollar bottles of scotch for sale there. not the place for a big piss-up...  also-i tried to change my blog around, and in doing so, deleted all your comments. leave new ones!!! and download a few videos from http://lonelybullet.com/oleary !

      so anyways here's the deal. i made it to seoul okay.   i went for a couple of beers with bill, andy, minjong and luke. ms. kwan drove me home around 2, i hastily packed my bag and ran back to the car. i slept at bill's, and woke up at 8am. started packing, had a breakfast, and monster calls ms. kwan on her cell. she doesn't answer.   we hightail it out to the car like we're starsky and hutch and get on the road. it's an uneventful drive, until we get to apkujeong to meet elly from the new school.   monster phones bill's phone just as i'm getting out of the car. bill hangs up. then his battery goes dead.   i get settled in my new apartment, get to a PC bang and check my email.   turns out monster drove all the way to PUSAN (about 3 hours) to scream at my recruiters. being young koreans, they took it completely, no doubt with their heads bowed in shame. why he chose to yell at them i have no clue, perhaps he thinks they're in cahoots with me and are trying to get me another job. i mean it'd be a good idea for them to be in cahoots with me since the shit-apple never paid for my flight over... but it isn't the case. they had no clue i was planning this.   so i have to email them and smooth things over. my plan is to buy out the recruiting fee and the plane ticket. it can't be more than about 1800 dollars, and i'll be making enough money to cope with that now. i explain about how the living situation was bad, how he was so abusive to myoung jin, and how he treats people who are actually under contract to him. i told them i hope he gets cancer of the face and his school goes bankrupt.   monster threatened his "connections with immigration" in daegu to the recruiters. truth of the matter, his connections are annoyed with him because he goes through foreign english teachers like most people go through dental floss. but still it's enough to make me a little scared of what may happen. i'm still on a tourist visa, and come may i'm going to have to go to japan to get my E2. i have the feeling that even an anonymous tip may be enough to piss off immigration.   oh well. there's always taiwan, but i so don't want to screw up this new job. so i'm in seoul, no friends, no over-friendly boss patting me on the back (which feels like being molested, incidentally. you should try it) and no idea where i am, really. apkujeong-dong is... uhh... somewhere. seoul is huge.   anyways, here's an experiment. adam paysse of seattle has allowed me to post video and photo files on his server, and is maybe going to help me build a better blog, with hyperlinks, multimedia capabilities and other bells and whistles. he wants to see how much a bunch of people downloading from me assaults his bandwidth.   so go here, and download a couple of the .avi files i have  http://lonelybullet.com/oleary  it's kinda like a science project. i'm most proud of the minoo.avi and moongi.avi, though the stuff of me yo-yoing is on par with scorcese. that'll happen when you give your digital camera to a 9 year old... they redefine cinema.   so anyways, i'm signing of from ulcer-land because i'm feeling like i'm on an episode of doogie howser, m.d.

      so i work my last day at REI andong. that's the big thing. by the time monster gets a chance to check my blog, even if he knows how to do it, which is doubtful, i will be long long gone. incheon airport? taipei? vancouver? another cryptic locale? wherever i am, he's fucked, i'm paid, and bill is a teeny bit unhappier but no less supportive.   last class of my last day this kid named myoung jin - who is generally a good student but a bit of a pest - gets escorted, sobbing, into the class by monster. the other kids are silent. monster starts yammering all authoritative-like in korean to this kid, who is getting no happier. monster leaves, myoung jin is blubbering, and all of a sudden monster returns with a bag of garbage. he dumps the whole bag of garbage on the fucking floor of my classroom, and orders myoung jin to start picking through it. he takes me aside and tells me 'oh, he threw some money in the garbage can, it is extremely rude in korea, money is very important'. don't i know it. 'please sean, you sit in my office, i will come get you'. so me and the rest of the class go to monster's office.  this is one of my problem classes, they're smart and nice kids, but in a group they're insufferable. loud, hyperactive, argumentative, pre-teens. i love and hate them because they're funny and annoying. there are two quiet girls who are really sweet. monster comes back to the office, mutters in korean and then all the 'problem' kids return to the classroom, leaving me and the two quiet ones.   five minutes later, we are called back to class, the class is immaculate, and myoung jin is still crying. monster takes me aside again and explains just how rude it is to throw money away in korea, especially since myoung jin did it in a fit of anger.   i ask him how much money.  "oh, maybe 150 won".  according to http://xe.com/ucc, the universal currency converter, 150 korean won is 0.168903 Canadian dollars.   monster degraded this kid and made him cry in front of his friends for 17 fucking cents. confucian tradition or not, that's seriously the pettiest thing i've ever seen. if the million or so other reasons to not work for this unfortunate collision of sperm and egg weren't enough, this is the icing on the cake, less than half an hour before the end of my final shift of 2 months. definitely sews the whole thing up... but i have never wanted to kick someone in the nuts so bad.   so TERROR played in seattle yet again, and i missed them yet again. like integrity and the ramones, i think i've found another band to be destined to not see. they probably suck now anyways but i've been stomping around the 'dong listening to 'lowest of the low' lately with this feeling like i could pick up a dude on a motorbike and throw him to japan. seriously, if you are ever looking to just beat the living shit out of someone, it's the record to listen to to get in the mood.   so in honor of the fact that TERROR will never see my music dollar, i bought a pair of adidas sambas. they're great shoes and i encourage all to pick up a pair. black ones, of course.  other news, i've found a brazilian jiu jitsu teacher. otis' advice for me when i told him i was planning to ride a motorbike across cambodia was "shit sean, you better learn a couple of chokes" in the hopes that if i got bike-jacked by some cambodian hillbillies i could, as he always says "gag 'em silly".  they may have knives but i'm sure the whole population of cambodia only has a cumulative weight of about 300 pounds. therefore me, pushing 190... i should be fine if i learn how to snap a couple of them in half at the same time. maybe i'll just make my parents happy and do the trip by bus. dad's cholesterol is at an all-time low but i'm sure he'll still figure out a way to have a heart attack if i'm bustin' shit like indiana jones.   i mean i'd make it look way better than harrison ford, of course... but i'm a little clumsy with the booby traps.

      weird vancouver/vernon/andong connection: i rented "ANTITRUST" last night - see a few posts back about how my movie tastes have gone into the toilet somewhat, out of pure necessity...  lo and behold, there's old jon "jonathan" young of vernon and the GMC skate posse, and that guy from breaker high who dated carrie ruscheinsky... tyler or ryan or whatever. his name has a Y and a bunch of other letters in it, mostly consonants. anyways... i know people who are sorta famous, and the mediocre movie that they and tim robbins are in is IN ANDONG!!!   yeah nothing else new is happening so that had to be mentioned.

      i'm in a PC bang trying to avoid monster. he wants to take me to daegu today to look at prospective textbooks. i have almost no interest in the curriculum of his school, because whatever i suggest he's going to say "in my opinion, this is better". he always says "in my opinion" because i think he thinks it makes him sound smarter. he could just say "i think".   once again his mewling little brat woke me up early on a saturday morning. i wanted to drown the kid in boiling diahrrea. i love him when i'm fully rested, he's a funny kid... but his voice is like nails on a chalkboard at 9am on saturday.   it's all going to be over soon.   currently i'm trying to amass some business casual wear. i've bought some nice shirts. i have to look like a champ in the coming months.   i'm mostly bored these days. there's nothing to do in andong except drink with the foreigners. all the girls here are either attached, unattractive or they don't speak english. i live with my boss anyways and how do you entertain a lady with monster plopped on the couch in his boxer shorts?   it's truly screwed. i think i will be happy when i leave this place.   funny thing happened, a kid saw me with an apple in my hand and said "uuuhhh APPLE!" practicing his vocabulary. "well, apple, yes. but did you know that in english you actually call it  a 'giraffe'?"   "really teacha? hmmm..."   everyone bug greg bennick to call his new band either THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST GLUTEN CHOIR or THE GREG BENNICK FIVE. really good names, i think.

      i'm updating for the sake of updating.   so the third lord of the rings "hobbits, go get a room!" won best picture last night. i haven't seen enough recent movies to know for sure if it deserved such accolades. those hobbits should really have started smooching though, it was too obvious.   so i've been seeing a movie a night lately. it's hard to do, since korea is such a dumping ground for absolute shit like starship troopers. in fact, one thing i've noticed is that many movies that get here are sequels of B-movies. we have Hamburger Hill 2, but not Hamburger Hill, clearly the worst of the 1980s Vietnam flicks. We have Warlock 3 but not the first two Warlock movies, which i'm sure are totally crucial pieces of cinematic mastery.   the vast vajority of my video store is taken up by titflicks-softcore porno... and let's just say that 99% caffeine free is 99% not my kind of thing. so i've been either renting various war-like movies, which i love though they're weird pro-america shit usually. "tears of the sun" is alright, as is "black hawk down". "the patriot" is okay too, i've actually never seen a revolutionary war flick. i'm sure it's questionable as far as historical truth goes, but interesting nonetheless, especially with the gerard depardieu lookalike (or was it gerard depardieu?) who just wanted to "kill redcoats".   what is most important is that i saw the first rocky flick, which i'd never seen. it was pretty damn good for something that stallone wrote on his own. good movie, but what's important is the mastiff in the pet store where the beautiful talia shire works - since i saw it, i've been having dreams about mastiffs and owning a mastiff. one was a dream where these girls from that band THE ORGAN had this secret hideaway boozecan in a secret passage in their apartment. i tried to go to a party there and a giant mastiff was their guard dog. weird, because i think a mastiff is about 8.25 times the size of any of the girls in that band.   so yeah, i want a mastiff but i think it's impractical because any apartment i get will be about the size of a mastiff. but i'm obsessed with mastiffs these days, that's the point. i'll get one when i get back and name it archie.   i'll get it to eat koreans. revenge for 1000s of years of dog-murder. way more practical than brigitte bardot's letter writing campaign during the world cup 2002.   archie the korean-crusher. what a great idea. i'm a genius.   i also had a dream that nardwuar died of cancer. i was sitting on my couch and i was really sad, and everyone from the band Most Precious Blood were patting me on the back saying shit like "buck up, camper!" and i cheered up. that would really suck if nardwuar died. he's the only person in the canadian media with anything good to say.

      so i've been pushed around on the subway enough to get pissed off... some ajushi (older dude) just totally aimed for me the other day, he was about four feet away and just started veering towards me in the corridor. i braced for it because i saw it coming and he ricocheted off me like a beach ball.   it's getting to the point where "babu" is not good enough. "babo yaa" i think is how you call someone a moron when they piss you off. it's enough so that the dumb bitch who knocked my coffee out of my hand on the subway because she was too stupid to look up from text messaging while walking needs to know, in korean, that's she's dumber than a bag of salt. so after following a "fistfights with koreans" post on www.eslcafe.com i find the "swearasaurus", which is a generator for bad words that goes across many languages and cultures. it's great, though i hear some of the translations are a ways off. i've heard some of these before though...  from http://www.insultmonger.com/swearing/korean.htm  "Geseki" =  "Son of a bitch" "Dong-muk-uh" = "Eat shit" "Ap'un mee chin nyun" =  "Silly bitch" - something i could have used with a lap ful of coffee at jongno station...    "Ano shipal" = "Fuck off"  ...all stuff i would use on a daily basis walking the in vancouver on its streets polluted with stupid, vacuous people with more money than brains... or just more hockey and television and corporate news fanaticism than brains. i even learned a few cantonese swears specifically for chinatown, they made the odd chinese dude a little testy when i spit it in his face after he poked me in the eye with his umbrella.   the thing about this site is that anyone can submit an insult with whichever korean translation they care to cook up. therefore, i was pretty excited at some of the stuff near the bottom of the list...  "Knee Be She Be Peck Pojie Da" =  "Your mother has a bald headed pussy"  "Mosenginom" = "Ugly person"  "Jungshin-byungja"  = "Psycho" (my personal favorite, makes my students crack up) "Net mejo" = "Internet masochist"... what the fuck is an internet masochist?!? "Gaesaekki dul jokka ra kuh hae" =  "Fuck the fucking fuckers!"... always a good thing to know. those fuckers... they're EVERYWHERE! "Duk-cho shibaalnom" - "Shut up, motherfucker!"   but... the best one, i find... and i hope to work it into my daily vernacular...  "Shibural jot kat'un nigimi jot manhan ddong mul eh t'wigyo jukil ship sekia."   which means:  "You are a dick like your mum's dick and the only way you should die is by frying you in diarrhea."  yes. frying someone in diarrhea. so many times i've been pissed off at someone, and thought "damn, i should fry you in diarrhea". now i can do it in korean, too!  nothing much else is new. i have an open house next week. i have to put on a show for some of the more critical apkujeong moms. they complained about a few of my early administrative mistakes... so i said "come on down, clowns!"  so i'll have a few moms in my 4:30 class on tuesday. it should change up the dynamic a bit. maybe they'll hit on me.

      again, for people concerned about lucas mcfadden but don't check the northwest hardcore board... (i'm sure there's at least one of you out there) his mom posted on the board details about his current condition. seems like he's pissed off enough say cuss words and to flip off his dad. a good sign i'm sure. i would be pissed off too... but i don't flip off my dad.  http://nwhardcore.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=2039&start=45  such posts offset the bajillion posts about walrus porn, fight stories why NOT going to ozzfest this year is stupid and should be punished by getting punched (slayer AND a judas priest original lineup). damn...  it'd be the best, seeing a bunch of lowest-common denominator shitheads yelling and screaming for some dude who most likely has a bondage bumdungeon for young hairless boys backstage. it'd be fun.   i swear, i picked the wrong damn year to sojourn in another country. the canucks are going to win... which i don't really care about but i'd like to see someone BESIDES crackheads blamed for wrecking shit in vancouver... slayer AND judas priest AND ozzy on the same bill... and i bet you ninety-five cents i'd get a chance to kick kim kinakin in his spineless dink once or twice. i'm missing out on so much good shit!  it really could turn out be a bad year. oh well, dream theater's coming!

      i just like svend robinson. he's a good dude. seems he's been caught pocketing shit at a jewelry auction... but he's legitimately citing post traumatic stress disorder - after banging his head hiking on galiano in 1997.  ----------- from today's vancouver sun:  William Koch, a psychologist who is also a professor in the University of B.C. department of psychiatry, said shoplifting is not common following stress, but it does occur.  He said some people when stressed will act on their temptation to steal and are usually people who have habits of compulsivity.  Barry Beyerstein, a psychology professor at SFU, wonders whether Robinson is suffering from depression, which he said could be a trigger for stealing.  "[The theft] seems like an example of irrational stealing, kleptomania," said Beyerstein, adding it can happen when an individual is feeling a high level of stress.  "Depression wasn't mentioned but this is often a trigger for that sort of thing -- extreme stress, mood disorder, depression and some of the chemical changes in the brain at a time like that do produce weird, compulsive urges and very great difficulty in controlling impulses in people. -------------------- if this is true, and i do believe it is... MY SISTER DROPPED ME ON MY HEAD WHEN I WAS A MONTH OLD. yeah, fractured skull, messed up fontanelle. and sometimes i have random urges to punch people.

      more from 'ab'norm drouilliard from www.nwhardcore.com/board:  Here's the update on lucas' condition: They're putting a plate or plates in his arm, which is apparently the most fucked up injury. as of last night, lucas was going into surgery for his back, and they were going to "fuse" his vertebrae, whatever that means. If his pelvis were not broken, he would be able to walk in a very short time. The last update I heard, they didn't know what to do about the pelvis, but his father, who's a doctor said that regardless he should be able to walk somewhat in 3 months. The only worse news than before is that they found that he suffered a couple of shots to the brain, and though they don't think that they're too serious, they aren't going to know if there's any brain damaged until he's not sedate and he's interacting with people.   As for cash, his medicare is completely taken care of since both his parents are doctors. As for other costs while he's down and out, I'll find out what he and his family needs if anything.   His dad also said he might be able to have visitors as soon as tomorrow, but I'll keep everyone updated on that as well. It's awesome to see everyone showing support for Lucas!   lucas is a trouper. i bet he'll pull through just fine and be pounding the skins again soon. the score? LUKE 1, CLIFF 0. that cliff got its ASS KICKED.

      this post by 'ab'norm drouilliard from the nwhardcore.com message board:  This past saturday, lucas (mcfadden, ex-reserve 34, carry on, burden, face tomorrow, rosary) was hiking at Mt. Burnaby with some friends, and slid down a hill, then fell off a cliff. He's in intensive care right now in stable condition. His injuries include: broken arm, leg, pelvis, and a shattered vertebrae. His spinal cord was not touched, though they have to operate on him to remove bone fragments. This is all the information we have right now, but I'll post any new info I have. Luke is at VGH but since he's in ICU, only immediate family can visit. Any changes on his condition will be posted Thanks, Norm  this sucks. i suppose anyone relevant to lucas' life is more likely to check out the northwest hardcore board than my blog; however if you're reading my blog (because it is the height of literary bliss) rather than the northwest hardcore board (which is most often an excuse to trade bird-porn, talk about marijuana and wonder 'who would win in a fight, rollins or danzig?)...  lucas pretty much got every bone in his body all messed up. there will be some sort of benefit to help lucas cope with the coming months of extreme physical pain and recovery. i can't go to them of course, but if you're reading this and give a shit, and haven't already, bookmark this site:  www.nwhardcore.com/board and any info on his condition will likely be more up-to-date there than it is here.   i don't know him all that well but he's a good kid... and when you hear something like that 5000 miles away, well... you feel kinda helpless and circle the wagons internet-style. i bet there's going to be benefits in seattle and vancouver.   also i believe greg HxC of seattle is attempting some sort of immediate fund to hook lucas up with an mp3 player and a bunch of literature to make the next little while more endurable.

      if there was any question as to bad dealings between the USA and the rest of the world... if anyone is even slightly doubting the US' 'humanitarian' and 'liberating' efforts worldwide... read "the trial of henry kissinger" by christopher hitchens. holy jumpin' jesus on a pogo stick, that's a dude who needs his ass executed.   cambodia vietnam laos bangladesh chile greece/cyprus  where else? as docs get de-classified, we may see more. not to mention the number of US servicemen he kept in action to ensure nixon's election in '68... i think kissinger's indirect and direct death toll is hovering somewhere around 2 million. kind of a lot for someone who ironically accuses hitchens of being a holocaust denier.   i love americans but i hate america.

      there's this thing about restaurants here. i don't know if i've commented on this before... but restaurants specialize in certain things. if it's bulgogi, they have a picture of a smiling cow with a chef's hat. if it's go din ah, a picture of a smiling fish with a chef's hat, usually giving the thumbs-up sign, as if fish have thumbs... and with all the cannibalistic connotations... i mean, if the restaurant served human flesh, would they have a picture of a human chef? it's just scary.   digression - someone please rent "cannibal-the musical" by the south park dudes and tell me if it's good. http://www.troma.com/movies2/cannibal/content.html  anyways, i've not seen a single dog restaurant with a smiling dog...   a few of my coworkers are planning to eat dog soon. there's a thing with koreans and dogs - they all get yappy little mutts that are (and you should say it like sling blade) "no bigger 'n a squirrel, i reckon" and all frilly and wearing bows and shit in their fur. they're going to somehow get their hands on one of these kickable little inbred flea-condos and bring it in to the restaurant...  "hey, we brought our own, can you cook it up?"  reminded me about the time a friend of my dad got really pissed at a guy who ran a chinese restaurant for some reason... he got some roadkill cats and walked in holding them by the tail during a busy lunch hour... "hey mr. tsu, where do you want these? the back door was closed!" or something like that.   yeah. THE CRUELTY MUST END. ONLY KILL THE ANIMALS WHO AREN'T CUTE!!!

      people begging for an update...  apkujeong is boring. there's really nothing to do here unless you like shopping. i don't really like shopping. i think that anyone who likes shopping has a few screws loose. and when you consider that the stuff here caters to koreans... i.e. cellphones, overpriced faux-vintage clothes, well, you can see that even the shopping can be frightfully dull. anyone want some 'old' adidas or pumas or asics, let me know.   umm. what's new? tilly angus, longtime portland resident, died a few days ago. that really sucks, she was a total sweetheart.   my niece thinks my (her and her brothers') cat is psychic. yes, klaus is psychic, he reads your mind to find out when you are most tired and chooses that exact time to tear around the house like a maniac, pretending he's hunting ghost mouse. he does have powers... and annoyance is his secondary power. cuteness is his strongest one.   my post about monster got accepted to the www.eslcafe.com "job information journal" which gives it just a bit more credibility than a post on a message board. pretty soon www.andongesl.com will be up too, in hopes that anyone searching for "esl jobs in andong" or whatever will be directed to a page saying "DO NOT COME ALL THE WAY FROM (insert western country here) TO WORK FOR THIS MAN". it'll be good.  hmm. not much else to tell. playing lots of counter-strike today to pass the time....

      so an email from good ol' bill back in andong regarding monster's new teacher...  "Dear SEAN,      The new American has worked one week now. He's staying at Monster's house. Monster told me he couldn't get new work visa for him, not even if he paid immigration. He said he was going to work him about 15 more days and kick him out without pay so that he would break even on the air ticket from Romania. He said by that time he would have another teacher. I know by that time the guy will be flat broke. Monster told me not to tell him, if I do, then 100% sure Monster will know I told. Julie teacher and Yong-Tak know. As for me he still owes me, now it is 525,000 for last month and new payday falls on the 10th, that's 6 more days AND once again I won't get full pay. This time the bastard will cite his teacher recruitment expenses. I told Mr. Lee last night that the first full check I receive, I will immediately quit."  i don't know why i'm in shock, but i am. some kid flew all the way from romania to work for REI. i have half a mind to go down to andong myself next weekend and give him a talking to. if bill can't muster up the balls to tell the kid what he's got into, i will... shit.

As well, he needs to overcome some of his shyness, as speaking more in class will help his understanding a great deal and improve his confidence in general."  this is officially the worst part of being a teacher. hey mom, don't you agree? how about you, chris?   the shitty thing is - i'm in my neighborhood PC bang. it's the one time i simply cannot leave, i have to get this done before tomorrow. i have 6 more kids to write 2 paragraph blurbs about... and min-gyu, my friendly neighborhood PC bang proprietor, has a ridiculous love for the song "right here waiting for you" by richard marx.  he's played it five times in the last half hour.  "whatever it takes, or how my heart breaks, i will be right here waiting for you..."  i want to saw someone's leg off, pull their liver out and then nail their head to the floor.   speaking of nails, anyone ever heard the band  urlLink THE TIGER LILIES?  austin introduced me to them at our friday night beer, corn nuts and gin rummy fest. they have a song written from the point of view of a dude crucifying christ... the chorus, sung in a ridculous polka falsetto, goes like this:  "i'm banging banging banging banging banging-in the nails... banging banging banging banging banging-in-the-nails. banging banging banging banging banging-in the-nails... banging banging banging banging banging-in-the-nails."  it is then repeated about 20 times. for some reason it doesn't get annoying.   richard marx, on the other hand, which has started playing for the sixth time  since i started typing...

      so i'm blogging and some dumb shitheel waste of a perfectly good sperm and egg posts the following comment WHILE i'm blogging.   "Here's a comment sean. Ive read through the archives on your blog and I think that some of the shit you say is the most narrowminded, racsist (sic) shit ever.   The fact that you would go out of your way to learn how to tell people to fuckoff (sic) in their own language is just another example of how ugly foreigners could be. You should go to another country to try and get enlightened, but it seems you just focus on the bad and dont see that asian cultures are the primary culture in human society.   (what this knobgobbler meant by this 'primary culture' thing i don't know. last time i checked the tigris and euphrates weren't in korea).   I really think you should get your head examined or leave Korea. There is no way it could be as bad as you say it is."  one. nice way to post dumb shit and then not leave a name so i can tell you by name that you're a dumb shit.   two. racist? i'm in a weird country. things are weird. korea is weird, people do weird shit here. i have to put up with culture shock. that's what this site is about. adapting to a foreign country is a challenge. i write about it, so you can eat a bowl of dicks.   three. i generally post here when i'm pissed off and need to rant. are you in korea? it's obvious you're not otherwise you wouldn't be such a blubbering vagina about whose feelings i'm hurting. they're rants, take 'em for what they are.  four. if there is a reason to be racist against koreans, it's this:     there are grown men who have haircuts like that here. i've put a lot of thought into it, and it is 100% okay assert some sort of supremacy over people who do shit like that with their hair.   i've posted your comment in full so everyone can read what a moron you are. go fuck a tree.

         new photos up  urlLink here.  the buddha's birthday parade was today. it was pretty cool. met my cousin, third cousin twice removed or whatever... i don't know how removed. shawna. cousin ethel's granddaughter. she seems cool but we got separated during the parade by STERN YET FAIR korean cops who didn't want us crossing lines, so i barely talked to her.   if you're reading this shawna, i didn't ditch you, come on out for hongdae club night on friday!  i wished gunnery sergeant hartman from "full metal jacket" had been there to sing "HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR BUDDHA". but he wasn't.      someone tell me a joke. seriously, my theory about the fact that there is a finite amount of jokes in the world is pretty much proven. we've reached the end.   a george bush joke perhaps? please?  one could take bill baker's earth crisis joke...  bill:"who wants to hear my earth crisis joke?"  crowd:"yeah"  bill:"earth crisis"   and where it says "earth crisis" insert george bush...  but comparing vegan metalheads who played way too much Dungeons and Dragons with george bush is a little retarded. i'm just hard up for material these days.

      i'm chewing on chocolate-covered poprocks.   i just spent the last few hours on a work outing, we climbed this mountain in the south part of seoul. i don't remember the mountain's name, but it was in yangjae.   I'M SO OUT OF SHAPE IT SUCKS. i was sweating and wheezing halfway up.  but we had some laughs. i spent most of the walk reciting shit from "so i married an axe murderer".   lately my students have been cracking me up. a couple of snippets:  this one kid justin is this sort of shy but deadpan funny guy. he always hands in these journal assignments with this odd sort of dada-ist humor, much like the shit on   urlLink  MY NEW FIGHTING TECHNIQUE IS UNSTOPPABLE  and it just cracks me up, though he gets all shy and doesn't understand why i'm laughing at his work.   one of the assignments in his workbook was to read a passage about the history of weaving. then, he was to write a short two paragraph story about weaving.   he came into class and said "uhh... sean?" which is how he addresses me all the time. "uhh... sean? i think i did the assignment a little wrong, i hope it's okay" and he produces the worksheet. instead of two paragraphs of sentences that had subject/verb agreement problems on par with some of my first-year essays, he drew a picture of a dude at a loom weaving with another person standing behind him.   the person in the back said "YOU ARE THE WORLD'S WORST WEAVER" in a word balloon.   the weaver simply replied "OF COURSE".   i laughed for about five minutes while justin just stood there red-faced, saying "uhh... sean?". anyone who knows of the "star dog, you are so special" drawing (i stole it from tod swank) i do sometimes will have a greater awareness of the ridiculousness of this picture. when justin brings it to our essay class on monday i'll post a photo of it. perhaps only i think it's funny.   in the same class, i have this girl named christina whose father is a doctor. i saw a rather cool pen in her pencil case, picked it up and said "cool" but then realized it had a giant VIAGRA logo on it, i guess he got it from a pfizer rep or something. the girl is 10 years old, and has no clue what VIAGRA is... i'm in my chair howling at the fact that a 10 year old korean girl has a VIAGRA pen.   she gets all shy and embarrassed and said "teacher, what's so funny? what is it? what is viagra?" and all i could say was "you're going to have to ask your parents, i can't tell you". weeks later, she had the same pen in her pencil case. "my mother scratched the logo off. she said she didn't know what it was, but she scratched it off anyways. what's VIAGRA, teacher?"  walking home with cynthia after our hike i said "did i tell you my VIAGRA story?" and she replied "yeah, last night, it was hilarious". can you imagine hearing me say that out of context? "oh dude, get o'leary to tell you his VIAGRA story... it's PRICELESS!"  perhaps the most important one was also done by justin. there was a little cause-and-effect activity in the workbook. i don't remember what exactly it was about, but his answer ended with "and then i would be the GOD and i would say 'HELLO GEGIOUS'". it was odd so i had to ask "justin, what is 'gegious'?"   "uhh... sean?" and he puts his arms out in a jesus christ pose. "you know, gegious?" and he says "hello, jesus!".  perhaps you had to be there. but if you say "helloooo, jesus!" as if you're saying "helloooo, dolly" or something it's fucking funny. it was in class.   so i'm there, with four students crowded around my desk, i'm convulsing, with tears coming out of my eyes... elly, my sorta forewoman/coordinator person walks by, peers in, and i think all my credibility as a disciplinarian went out the window.   for those of you who don't think PMS exists, or those of you who think women are even halfway sane,  urlLink  this woman killed her boyfriend with her Ipod  - this story should prop up all my theories that bitches iz mental and that a life of benevolent misogyny is the way to go.   thanks to josh payton of seattle, wa. i have access to all sorts of news stories people just don't get. in fact, if you're even slightly interested in the following subjects:  "george bush is a bigger insane fuckhead murderer than nixon" "the US has been doing more insane, fuckhead murderous shit than you can even comprehend and here's proof" "rasputin's tackle preserved in formaldehyde" "marijuana makes you feel good, say funny shit and should be legal and free" "certain bands are really really good and if you don't like them you're a douche" "photos of dudes with hyenas for pets"  well then, you should read his blog  urlLink  EARTH VERSUS ME  ... i do. sometimes i post there. i'm in the consortium.    urlLink  burt reynolds does an advice column there too.    as you can see, i'm now able to post links. josh is my html teacher.   for those of you who know what a shitbrown poffenroth knob is, well, they're still good.   not much else is new. certain people are still assholes and should be killed. they know who they are. other people rule and should meet me in thailand on july 31. i get a week of holidays and if you have the means, i strongly suggest a week of beaches, tom yum soup and beer with your close pal sean.

      ok... update. a real update.   went to meet ms. lex spahr of seattle wa (well kirkland) and we had dinner at the moghul restaurant. it was fun. we ate, we talked about being in korea... two kids whose socialization is rooted in the hardcore scene have a unique perspective on this place.   so we talked a lot about BANE and how aaron bedard is a motivational speaker/gospel tent revival preacher of sorts... how the blurr setting on my camera can make streaming-light-style action photos similar to the type presented by such artistes as eric flexyourhead or "little" mike witherspoon:  urlLink link   and we were laughing when i yelled "INCARNATION" really loud at gyeongbukgung while taking photos in an 'early 90s hardcore record cover' style and it was really funny but maybe seven of the people who read this blog will get it, because, well, you just are not DOWN.   yeah... i'd kill seven people to go to a hardcore show right now. korean music is the most anticlimactic shit i've ever heard. being here is like being time-warped back to 1988  and 1957 at the same time. all the bands here are one-hit wonders that nobody remembers after six months, and the lyrical themes are all "i loved you, you left me, i want you back, i was a bad person, come home please or i'll slit my wrists".  there is a counterculture here apparently... i was told there is a bar called D.R.U.G. in hapjeong that is korea's punk rock scene. then i was told "they had a house band until all the members got drafted".  most of my coworkers don't seem to understand my plight.   it's raining. this is starting to sound like a fruity livejournal. this blog was meant to be a sociopolitical/historical commentary and now i'm just whining. i sound like doogie howser, M.D. and i need to be punched.   new photos, click here!   urlLink link   i especially like the jindo - i want to get a jindo, bring him back to canada and name him "BO", short for 'boshintang'. anyone who knows a thing or two about korean food knows why that is funny.

      so i made it through my 'open house'... basically five korean parents sitting quietly through my class while i nervously did the rigamarole of my school's curriculum.   the parents were there for an hour, i pressed the flesh, made a couple of new friends, and sent the kids for a break.   during that hour the kids were silent, almost too afraid to ask questions. especially the two 'bad kids', john and david, who i affectionately refer to as 'tweedledumb' and 'tweedledipshit'.  the parents left.  the kids all of a sudden started ripping paint off the walls and throwing books out the window. one kid started spontaneoulsly bleeding from his palms, another re-wrote the new testament, replacing every instance of the word 'lord' with 'sandwiches'.  i considered it a good way to teach him verb tenses and articles, we're going to laminate it, frame it and hang it in the hall...

      damn, korea can't even get it together to have a decent tainted-food scandal...   urlLink  this is a story about a dumpling scandal  gone apeshit. there's a big scare about korean dumplings (mandu) made in china...  it wasn't korean people making the dumplings...    therefore the fact that rotten radish and who knows what else is in them is evidence that non-koreans are CORRUPT AND BAD.   some woman who just lost her baby to SIDS was quoted in the korea herald yesterday as saying "i ate those dumplings every day during my pregnancy" and therefore that's why her baby died.   korea is mediocre in everything else (except cuisine)... music, culture, modern architecture... if you check my suwon photos, you can see that it even has a MEDIOCRE WALL OF KOREA. so, korea might as well have mediocre food scandals too.   it would have been good if the dude hadn't jumped out his office window. instead he could have walked down the street with "this thermos... and... this soju bottle... and THIS lamp..." and his dog ddoong-head.   steve martin. what happened? seriously, what the fuck happened?

      so here's an update.  people have been griping about how since i left andong my blog has been rather dull. well i've settled in here in seoul, and there's little to tell...  i work  i go home  i rent movies   i go out with my coworkers and my other friends  that's about it. we went out for messican food today and michelle was saying "it's (living/working in korea) like a holiday, only we babysit".   the weather has gotten EXTREMELY hot and though yesterday was rather breezy, the humidity here makes it so that walking in downtown seoul is like slicing your way through flaming jell-o. it's seriously harsh. most of my coworkers are from the eastern seaboard... michelle, alex and kimmy are from New York/Jersey, RD and austin are from ohio, and cynthia's from florida and north carolina. charles is from a suburb of freakin' new orleans.  needless to say the vancouverites on staff (4) don't get much sympathy in the crotch rot department. i've considered buying maxipads or depends and placing them under my sweat glands. i fluff up the ol' niagaras (inside joke) with baby powder, i shower three times a day... but i still chafe like a fucking idiot.   for those of you portland staffers reading this... imagine being at the washington, right at the end of the 7th floor hallway near the hot water pipe... ALL THE TIME. it sucks, and it's a pretty close approximation of the smells here too.     so it's going to be a long, hot summer. i got through my first week of intensive, which means i have an extra 3 hour class at 9:30. i then break for 2 hours, returning at 2 to start my normal schedule of 2-3 classes depending on the day. it's been tolerable for the most part, but friday was insane due to many little office screwups that i don't care to mention... just mishaps.   it was a bad day for everyone i think because it culminated in austin's "chicken and beer" plan. all week he'd been saying "i just want chicken and beer". and so we went to the chicken hof (hof is beer garden/bar). on the way, these dudes -   - were staggering around outside. i took a photo and the one who wasn't puking in the photo started yammering, staggering and saying "ship-pal" to me, which, translated literally, is "eighteen" but for some reason it also means "fuck you". kinda like how "deelui lo mo" in cantonese is translated literally as "go fall down in the street" but for some reason it also means "go shag your mom" or something like that.   korea is screwed. marijuana is seen as the potential fall of korean society, yet these jackass drunk dudes are such a common sight that it's hard to take koreans seriously when they talk about a society's collapse. walking around apkujeong - the most affluent neighborhood in korea - you see puddles of dried puke every 20 feet.   the rationale behind this is, of course, confucianism. again. if your senior (i'll explain more later) is drinking and you're not drinking, you're letting him/her down. if he drinks, you drink or you lose face. saving face is the key to korean society. therefore, you drink and drink and drink and then you puke and fall asleep on the street:    the seniority thing is weird. i have a class of kids who are about 11, and of course boys hate girls... but i'll say "ok, hand the sheet to your friend" and they all look at me "ohh, teacher... he's not my FRIEND, i'm 11, he's 10" or "she's not my friend, she's a GIRL". which is understandable, but the stressed looks on these kids faces... so if someone's your senior, you pour their drinks, you bow lower... and most importantly, you do NOT criticize them. they're older, therefore wiser. always a great idea, especially when the people older than you are perenially full of muleshit.   if my family was korean i probably would have beat at least one of my uncles to death with a shovel before i turned 19. "we're older, therefore we're right". same shit, different pile of lowest-common-denominator trash. it was fun being younger AND RIGHTER than them but had i been in korea it would have been intolerable. plus, that punk bitch chris richard would have got away with beating his girlfriends alot more than he has in canada. not that anyone ever did anything significant about that in canada though.   (i am officially digressing and talking shit here, but i'll back it up. for those uninformed - uncle chris is a drunk fool whose coping mechanism for dealing with the silent desperation of being a loser with nothing to offer the world... is beating on people smaller than him... usually his girlfriend/spouse. people rarely do shit about it. he's never done time, nobody's kicked the living shit out of him... a strange set of circumstances).  so we finish at the chicken restaurant, we all smell like barbecue, and we decide to get a bottle of scotch (it's cheap as shit here) and go down to the river, drinkin' ghettostyle.   on the way down, however, we saw soju rebel number one, the 'shippal' guy. it was about an hour later and he was sleeping on the sidewalk, like 6 inches from the road, on the busiest street in the neighborhood, with his suit jacket as a pillow. it was funny. some christian fag got all testy with me like i was going to piss off god by taking this poor wanker's photo but i told him that jesus is a drunk and a whoremaster... all that shit in the bible about mary magdelene? geez.    the river... it was tons of fun. (sean o'leary to korean girl with tiny white dog) "hey can i get your number?" (girl with dog)"no" (sean)"HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAHAHAHAHHA" as he runs away shrieking and swinging his arms.   but here's solid, irrefutable proof that drinking scotch is a good idea:    yeah. it's good. roger david (RD) copas...   ...he felt worse than me. i was surprisingly okay. dodged a bullet saturday morn.   um... not much else. i'm studying french a lot. met a french dude last night, we're going to talk lots. trying to meet this quebecoise who said she'd be my language partner. hey mom - wouldn't it be great if i got my french up to a conversational level... in KOREA?  yeah. this weekend was like the lancing of a carbuncle. it'll probably mellow out, but intensive has started and we needed to blow off some freakin' steam. maybe the drunk dudes in seoul thing will turn into a coffee table book at some point.   oh and everyone read "round ireland with a fridge" by tony hawks.

      you don't have to go see "kill bill" to know that katanas are urlLink  BAD ASS   . just go to the home shopping network!  yeah. it's saturday. intensive starts on monday.   intensive is 12 hour days of teaching. i get a 2 hour break in between my morning class and my afternoon classes... but it still licks gerbil pouch. i hear that the overtime pay is insane, but i'd rather stay sane.  oh well.  i have a new hobby - urlLink "rearranging the neighborhood".   it's fun.  tanya and tracy get married today. i was talking to my student justin, he was telling me about a movie he saw and how i should never see it because "it was about homos" and i was thinking about how even the gay people in korea are heterosexual...  so i pulled my invitation to their wedding out of my desk drawer and he just looked at it like it was something from another planet. far from being homophobic or just lame about people with the same-shaped ugly bits humpin', it was just the most foreign thing he had ever seen. more foreign than weaving.   thankfully, he could see the sense in not giving a shit what two other people do in their spare time. shit, you're gay. nobody cares but you. so shut up and let's drink beer. koreans don't get it. it's like telling someone that black is actually red, or that ABBA are a good band.   the pressure to get married at all costs here is insane... even here in upscale, affluent, cosmopolitan apkujeong.   domestic violence in korea is at about 40%, too. divorce is almost unheard of.   heterosexuals have destroyed marriage. fags and dykes are rebuilding it. i like that.   and that's the end of my political rant about gay marriage, i'm just stoked for my pals. tanya and tracy, if you get a chance to read this, i'm going to have a bunch of drinks for you tonight in hongdae, and hope to see photos of the ceremony soon. perhaps we can close the brickhouse some time in the nearer-than-further future...   whirred. rearrange your neighborhood!

      just a quick update before i go ON FUCKIN' HOLIDAYS BITCH  yeah i'm going to thailand for 8 days, i think i'm going to hit ko chang and ko samet on the way back. there's a long weekend in thailand so i have to find somewhere that isn't completely booked up. rayong is a big tourist destination, ko chang is more remote.   anyways... that's for people who know thai geography.   it's been a good movie week.   i saw "monster"-the aileen wuornos story. aileen wuornos was that lowtrack truckstop prostitute who murdered a bunch of dudes. christina ricci plays her girlfriend. it's hard to watch, not for the violence but for the way charlize theron plays a complete and utter social misfit/loser. it makes you think about every time you've ever said or done something dumb in front of people.  "cold mountain" is okay. good battle scenes. pregnant pauses. renee zellwiger (sp?) spittin' chaw and rippin' heads off chickens. jack white playing crazy bluegrass tunes. whatsername mrs. cruise being her annoying self.   "frida" is amazing. really beautifully shot, amazing color, and they do this shit where kahlo's paintings come to life and become CGI backdrops for the set. salma hayek doesn't even look like salma hayek... she looks like... frida kahlo. and frida kahlo is hot. parge just said to me "i was always repulsed by the monobrow" but parge has been wrong before... he likes hockey.  that's enough. i'm going to finish my report cards and then teach my last 8 hours before a quick plane trip to this place:

      this is important, and it's update #3 in the last 3 hours. i guess i'm stoked blogger works again.  &nbsp;  i was scanning thru old comments&nbsp; and found this, courtesy of jenni isfan (nee finnegan). context-it was a comment on my "svend robinson's brain broke" post from some time in may when he got caught for stealing shit from a jewelry auction.  --------  "Ok...so I just can't help myself - I know I am a little late on the uptake but that is what happens when you have two frickin babies......So this one time I was at a gay pride parade - and like, Sven was there and was like, talking to us all. One of my roommates - a gay welder w/ a low rider .... was talking his ear off about wanting to start gay support groups for teens ( and I was like, - maybe if he can stop raving for like, 5 seconds and come down from the meth) ANYWAY - I digress - So after he was able to politely shut the gay/welder/lowrider/meth head up - he turned to my other roommate who was a painfully pretty young man who looked like he had just stepped out of GQ - and said " If you ever need your plumbing done in Spuzzum, you should give me a call" - and then he like, walked away. So I turn to my group of friends and was like "He's a plumber?" *confused look* and they were like "uh no you fucking retard" Anyway....That's my story."   -Jenni Isfan of Westbank, B.C.; a star.   as are her two sons, cole (older) and adam (younger).

          Dear Sean:  If you can see sad George Bush, it means the image upload and publish settings on your blog are working again. When uploading images, I would recommend typing in "/images" (no quotes obviously) in that second field of the pop-up window where blogger just gives you a forward slash (/). If you do that it will keep the files on your ftp server a lot more organized.  This will make no sense to anyone.

      so we went to masan this weekend for ol' lex spahr's birthday. it was fun. train ride was quite scenic, and there were many laughs to be had since our four-person party army was in full effect. RD, cynthia, and vinny saborino (ryan) were rockin' the whole way. the fact that a dude was coming by every fifteen minutes or so with a tray fulla mekju (beer) and ALSO the fact that ryan bought an outlandishly large bottle of bourbon made the trip rather enjoyable.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;  so ryan, getting louder and louder, gets "shushed" by the train security guard. it was funny.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;       he promptly fell asleep.&nbsp;       we end up in masan, and before heading out to lex's apartment, we decide to stop for some grub. there really are not that many foreigners in masan... at all. we got the whole royal treatment from this restaurateur who was stoked to try out some english. cynthia, who can speak a little korean, decides to tell the ajushi, in korean, that i am a famous singing star back&nbsp;in canada. whether or not the dude bought it, i don't know... but he still insisted i sing for the whole restaurant. i insisted on having 30 more mekjus before attempting such a stunt... &nbsp; so he brought me a beer, saying "ahh... service!" ('service' means 'on the house' in korea).   soon i was singing "makin' your way in the world today, takes everything you got..." yeah, the only thing i could think to sing was the theme from "cheers". i felt like NORM when i walked in. &nbsp;   lex spahr has the largest apartment in korea. it's a three bedroom apartment, with much higher ceilings than you're used to... she also has a patio. what's more, you can BREATHE in masan. the air is clean. &nbsp; yeah, we drank and slept and then went home. i suppose you had to be there but it was, as sabo will say, "shits 'n' giggles". &nbsp;  blogger's being a bitch. it's got this annoying new interface that makes it 'dummyproof' but i'm not that much of a dummy. like anything computer-based, if it's made 'easier' so that any old nimrod can blog, it becomes extremely annoying to quasi-veterans like myself. fucking lame. even their 'photo upload tool' is useless. it won't let me post html tags to my hosted photos, it won't let me use their 'help' to post photos. so go to my msn page:  urlLink http://groups.msn.com/uberscheisse/shoebox.msnw

      if you look about 6-8 posts back you'll see a picture of limahl (neverending story singer guy) c. 1985 or so.   so i went for my first korean haircut... my hair was getting just fucking unmanageable with the humidity. it takes about an hour to dry on a good day if i'm not in my airconditioned classroom or apartment. so i got 'er snipped.  gabe (sino-canadian) recommended this one place in the neighborhood because the lady spoke good english. so i went.   i said "i want a trim, you know, trim?" and held up my finger and thumb to show her the roughly 4 cm i wanted trimmed off my head. i'm into having long hair these days, it's a CCR thing i suppose (did i tell you about the tshirt i'm going to get printed up?).  anyways, she starts chopping. she left me with all these flouncy sideburns and chopped random shit into my hair in an attempt to make me look like some korean animation star. it was like she thought "hmm, blondish hair. he probably wants to look like  urlLink Yu-Gi-Oh . so she did all this flouncy gay shit with my hair.   of course, she noticed the panicked expression on my face and said the decidedly korean "are you okee?" and i pointed to all this shit that i wanted to have changed. she did almost okee, but it is now annoying and unmanageable.   i had been wondering what they do with retarded people in korea. i figured it out. they send them to hairdresser school.   addendum - the shirt i'm getting? it's just going to say "i'm john fogerty, bitch". CCR rule.

      ok. i'm back for the attack, fools.   the explanation - i'm not sure if my last post about being banned in korea is up, since i haven't been able to actually read my blog lately and i have the memory of a carp...  kim sun-il, a south korean dude from busan, was chillin' in iraq, just walking down the streets minding his own business, when iraqi dudes snapped him up and eventually beheaded him.   it's a national tragedy on a huge scale, with a myriad of emotional reactions from all levels of korean society. many koreans are anti-USA (of course excepting the fact that they steal most of their popular music styles from the US, are somewhat dependent on trade with the US) and so being involved in a widely criticized US war weighs on their minds a great deal.   then there's an innocent korean casualty. i'm sure you've seen the news.  so a bunch of jackass "faces of death" fans posted the video of his actual beheading on their blogs.   korean government bans all blog sites.   of course, if you want the video, you can still download it from non-blog sites, from some p2p program like kazaa, or whatever. therefore anyone who really wanted to see it could get it in five minutes. in korea.   i downloaded it five times one day just to see if i could do it.   but my blog was still banned. at first i had thought it had something to do with my expose of the extreme nature of korean alcoholism, and korean denial of the problem ("soju makes you strong, and eating dogs gives you STAMINA!!!)... but no.   so josh payton,  urlLink a golden god , has agreed to host my blog - and as far as i know, earth versus me isn't a heat score that will attract the moronic ire of the korean government.   just another thing that increases the number of times i shake my head in disbelief in this country.

      so i still can't look at my blog... i can still update it though, i hope. i can't read your comments.   josh has said he'd host it so as soon as i can mail him a bottle of korean whiskey i think http://seandammit.earthversusme.com will be up and there won't be shit the bedwetting crybabies at the korean ministry of information and communication can do about it.   "sean o'leary in japan: like a sore thumb on a hand with a billion fingers cut off at the first knuckle." - josh payton of seattle washington.  i went to japan to renew my visa yesterday. it's like korea, but with way more architectural variety, cleaner streets and more green space. i took some pretty rad photos, which will be uploaded soon enough. i'll put them on my msn page and then eventually put them up here.   so here's a story to tell the kiddies. coming to korea in the state i was in was downright moronic. i had finished my BA, but didn't have the degree in hand. so for the last 6 months, i've been working under the table and illegally. it was tense, and for those of you who have been reading this blog since it was interesting (the andong days), it has always bothered me that MONSTER could somehow be able to get to me through immigration. people had reassured me that since i was working illegally, he was as to blame as i was for what was going on.   i went to japan. i went to the korean embassy. i got my papers. i got my visa. nothing at all happened. therefore i'm in the clear. i am officially working legally in korea, with a foreigner's card (well it's on the way).    soooooo... bill is still being fucked over by monster. bill still has to beg and plead for money he is owed. i talked to him today and monster is trying to prove to bill that he doesn't know what a contract release letter is.   it's clear that monster is still burning about me taking off on him. he says to bill occasionally "of all the foreigners... sean was the worst. he just took money and run". which really means "of all the foreigners sean was the worst, because he left before i had a chance to fuck him over". nobody hates being stolen from more than a thief.   so i have this idea where i take photos of myself, my E2 visa and a big wad of cash paid to me by mr. philip han, a boss who is responsible to his employees... and mail them to monster. there would be another one with me holding a sign that says "PAY BILL, YOU DISHONORABLE PIECE OF SHIT", because losing face/honor is the worst thing ever for a korean. also the embarrassment of being a thief that got what he deserved would be too much for the guy to take.   but i probably won't.   it's so humid. it's so very humid. i sweat like a fucking idiot here.   once again, i can't check the blog so if there's spelling mistakes go stick your head in a toilet. punch yourself in the liver. wreck someone's throat.

      the rain stopped. ko chang has, for the past 2 days, been kicking more ass than could possibly be expressed. swimming, getting sunburnt, riding motorbikes from one end of this (actually very large- about 60 km) island to the next... listening to teeeeeerrrrrible covers of "roadhouse blues" from people who are caucasian enough (but way too german) to know better... i mean, if you were thai and playing "roadhouse blues" you have an excuse. you're thai. if you're german, well, you're just wrong. ask aram - you speak a DOG LANGUAGE!!!  and mai tais are fucking gross. punch anyone who says different.

      ko chang ain't so bad. it rains for an hour and then it's cloudy for an hour.   rented motorbikes today and saw the south end of the island. there was so little there, just a bunch of tiny settlements and a small wat. i got my scooter up to 90 kmh/h. that was dope.   i'd upload some photos but i don't have my software here. if these computers had XP i could just upload them straight, but no such luck.   i'm eating red curry. i'm going to have a siesta and then eat some barbecued mackerel.  mackerel is slowly beating out trout and tuna as my favorite fish. do yourselves a favor and have some mackerel.

      so i'm on ko chang and as usual i have reason to bitch about something. and plus, it's been raining straight for two days so i might as well type.   there are two seven-elevens here now.   there are lowrise hotels, two story resort/spas, and i think a golf course. no proof on that one yet.    and i'm sorry to say, michelle - the "lonely beach nature huts" have fallen into disrepair. it looks like a fucking ghetto. the little beachside bar is gone. so is SUN the intrepid beachside bartender/firedancer/kitten breeder.   this place has been overrun with tourists-it's a thai long weekend, buddhist holiday. they go home today. is it arrogant for me to tell a bunch of thais to GET THE FUCK OFF MY ISLAND?  one positive thing, i ate some amazing ginger mackerel last night. and then i went to bed early.
