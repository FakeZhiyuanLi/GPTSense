      It's me, Andy. Hum, what to say. I just started this blog and really want to keep it going, I've tried this before but I always say screw it and never look at it again. There was always some interesting stuff in there before, but that's gone now, to bad, I have a bad memory. I think it would be really cool to come back and read all of this 15 years from now, when I'm 31, which would be my Golden Birthday year! So, since I am going to do something like this, what should I say? Let's start out by saying who I am. I'm Andy Linzmeier. I live on Greenfield Avenue with a crappy house with the white paint stripping off. It now has blue and green paint on it, underneath the white that is. I'm 16, got my liscense May 19, 2004 in Steven's Point with Jaime's Blue Taurus. My first car was a 1990 Mercury Cougar, which I never got to drive leagally because My dad blew the head gasket a long time ago. Now I have a green 1993 Ford Thunderbird 3.8 Automatic. Needs a new tranny though, good thing I got the Cougar. I love Cougars and Thunderbirds. I go to coolcats.net and cougarnuts.com my nickname was 90CougarLS, now it's superman on cougarnuts. Right now it's 3.04.am on june.21.2004 I know it says it on the blog but I am thinking about something to write. I guess this is all for today. Actually let's talk about Brandon (Bonney is the last name). I met Brandon in 7th grade in Art class. We clicked right away. We had the same interests and the same personalities. We both love(d) Ford. He had a Mustang. We made it through 9th grade fine. We went to West Junior High School in Rapids. Then less than two weeks after school got out, well, let's start at the beginning. Brandon and Dusty were going to go to a movie. For some reason Dusty couldn't go. So Brandon went out to Lake Wazeecha with Steve Virgil, Virgil we call him. Gordy Ashbeck was out there (aka Asspack) along with Tony Rosenthal (twin to the hottie Courtney Rosenthal (nicked named hooters). I don't know if anyone else was out there. So Virgil and Brandon were at a picnic area acrossed from Redsands, a beach type thing on Wazeecha. They went to swim across. Brandon got a little bit in and told Virgil he doesn't think he can make it. Virgil grabs him and swims with him then stops and rests. He did it three times when he lost Brandon. Virgil swam over to some people and told them to help, they told him to go save your buddy. That was on June 23, 2003, the last time Brandon was ever seen alive.  That's all for now.
