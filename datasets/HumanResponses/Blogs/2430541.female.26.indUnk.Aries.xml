      Hello all and HAPPY NEW YEAR! I myself am working this year. I figured it's better to MAKE money than to spend a ton of money like I did last year. Ended up get mugged too, so there was even MORE money down the drain.   I'm spending the evening with some of my favorite people though. Matt D. aka Tyrone, Eric, Luke, Holly, and my favorite people from Bizar Entertainment (if you need a DJ team...let me know...I'll hook you up with them, they're great!!) So the nights not a total loss. Although this is the start to a LONG rest of the week for me....but I'll be all good I can hang with the big boys :)  Now I'll share my theory on New Years resolutions. I think that they are an excellent way to set yourself up for failure. You put too much pressure on yourself, then end up giving it up in 3 weeks time (if you even make it that far). So my suggestion....funk the resolution. Do something for yourself cause you WANT to do it when you want to. Not just cause it's a new year. So set your goal low so you don't feel so bad when or if you fail. Like, paying an extra hundo to your Amex, getting your oil changed on time for once, or putting 5 bucks occasionally in your savings for once. It's all about doing stuff you need to do anyway, but better....not about losing 60lbs by June or meeting Mr or Ms right. Those goals are so WAY out there, besides, that all comes in time when YOUR ready not when the 'new year' hits. It's not a magical day, just a date on the calendar.   So for all ya'll out there going to party tonight...BE SAFE!! The trains run in Chicago from 8pm till 6am for only a penny so if you can't drive DON'T. And Matty P....you be safe too, I don't need my favorite high schooler in jail for public intoxication....no tub puking either, control the liquor intake!  Have a great time! See ya Friday....hasta

      Only one more day till the New Year and it's still so hard to believe. I swear it just turned 2003....now 2004....I feel as though I'm getting old. Geez, I'm SO close to my 10 year high school reunion I could spit on it and if the years keep going by as fast as they have....geez it's like tomorrow then!  I'm having this awful wave of tired lately....if I didn't know better I'd say I was pregnant, but since that requires having sex....I'm going to say that's out of the question. It's probably because I don't get to rest or eat properly. I need to start taking better care of this body of mine cause it's the only one I got! Lord knows it's broken enough as it is. What happened to that teenager metabolism that I had? I want it back please!   So I was going to say I wouldn't be posting for the rest of the week, but turns out I have to come to work because a chicka at my work is having furniture delivered so I'm stuck....BOO. Friday I'll be sleeping under my desk for sure! This whole week is going to blow with the amount of hours I have to work. But since I owe my dentist about another $650 .... it'll come in handy I suppose.  I'll be happy when the New Year starts, things should calm down a bit for me. At least I'm crossing my fingers that they do, and I have a feeling they will. Couldn't get any worse than the last two years right? (OK, it could but were just going to pretend for a moment they couldn't)  So I'm off today to check for more bills in the PO Box.....grab some wine for my hotel, maybe do some shopping with my holiday gift certs....don't get your hopes up Luke I'm still not modeling what I get from Vicki's even if you did by me the gift cert :)   Hasta peeps.....

      I can not even BELIEVE it's almost the New Year. December 29th! What the! It seems like just yesterday I was jammin' out with Liz this time of the year. Now I'm working so much I can't even find time to sleep or eat properly!   I did come to the realization the other day that I'm a fat ass....ok ok, not really, but my doc is giving me the advice of losing some poundage before I develop heart problems. Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not the thinnest or the fattest gal in the world, my issue is my 'body fat content' When this lass was a dancer she was nothing but muscle and for the couple of years after that she maintained a good portion of that. Then came the office jobs and I don't move around as much, I snack more, I eat late cause of the second job.....what did I get and extra 20 lbs and some muscle that has turned so kindly to fat.   I'm still a looker, at least I've been told. (I think more so with my clothes on....certain friends of mine will now keep their mouths shut about certain events I may or may not have done for laughs, shock value, and or for kicks) But since I have a family history of heart disease and stoke it's about damn time to start talking a LOT better care of myself. Otherwise I'll be pushing up daisies by 30. So off to the gym I go...no more pasta and bread for awhile...damn if it wasn't for the fact that I love pasta and bread this wouldn't be so difficult!  Ok enough about my fat ass....on to New Years, I don't know what everyone else is doing this year, but I'm WORKING. That's right...working all night then opening the restaurant in the morning. So Luke, Holly and I decided to get a room across the street. That way, one it saves Holly and I from driving on the same roads as a bunch of crazies, two we won't have to get up as early in the am when we have to be at work cause we're across the street, and three....Luke is only 20 and we wouldn't want to ditch him just cause he's not old enough to get into the bars. It'll be more fun this way anyway I think. (well 10 times safer at least.) FYI for all you partiers....on the toll way (294 for those who are that dense) last week nearly every exit ramp had a road block up to do random safety inspections! So DON'T drink and drive...cab it, and if you don't' live in the city...stay sober or designate a driver....it's not worth the consequences.

      Well the dreaded Christmas season is finally over and now all I have to do is to try and get my checkbook back in order to pay the bills.   Most of you know my credit cards are MAXED from all that time without a job. I don't seem to be making much of a dent either. I'm thinking about consolidating my debt, but I'm not really sure how that whole thing works. Has anyone out there ever done it? If so email me and let me know.   Anyway, I had a good Christmas with the family. I think my bro and I had more fun playing with the kids stuff than they did. Sad but true. I did get a winter coat from mom and pops (mostly pops cause he's the one who insisted that they get one for me.) For those of you who didn't know I've lived in Chicago for quite some time without much more than a fall jacket and some gloves. Chicago winters are DAMN cold so I'm more than grateful for the jacket!! **I also got a George Foreman grill so now I can make my own grilled chicken salads! YEAH!  I did hear from lots of people over the holiday too. Luke called and gave me a break from the kids for a bit on Christmas Eve. Thank goodness cause they were MORE than hyper on Christmas Eve. Took us 3 hours just to get them to lay down for more than 5 minutes!! I heard from a friend I haven't heard from in a year on Christmas....Jonathan. It's nice to catch up with old friends especially this time of the year. (and in case any of you reading this know who I'm talking about he's doing well and happily with a new girl, Nicole, for the last 7 months.)   So now all I have to do is concentrate on the weight loss for what I gained over the holiday. TOO much food. Especially for a single gal on her own who doesn't really get to have 3 square meals a day.  I suppose I'll concentrate on it AFTER I get my homemade cookies from Luke.....I better get my cookies from Luke!   Well, anyway, I have to make it look like I'm working even though this office is deader than it was BEFORE Christmas!  Check ya later!

      Merry Christmas! Happy Hanukkah! Happy Kawanza! Happy Holidays! Season Greetings! Happy Yule! (am I politiacally correct?)  Ok, so it Christmas Eve and I'm at work, I think there's something seriously WRONG with that. I should be sleeping, or at LEAST helping my mom cook. But instead I'm sitting here writing in my blog. Hmmm....I suppose being with family isn't that important with my company.  Oh well at least I got my shopping done. I only bought for the kids this year cause I'm BROKE! But it's always fun to watch the kids open presents. I thought it was a little disturbing that the toys from my childhood are making a come back, but I've accepted it now. I did buy my nephew the 'Hungry Hungry Hippos' game...my mom says that's all he talks about getting. He's 4 it's cute, but still a little scary he's sleeping with my old 'Care Bear'. This stuff was cheesy in my day...why bring it back? Oh well....  May everyone have a safe and happy holiday and I'll be back on Friday!   Check out this Christmas card Johnny Blaze sent me. I laughed so hard I almost cried!  http://kringles.mondominishows.com/bells.asp?affil=fan  Hey, here's a question my friend Joe broght up today. Egg Nog....I know what the egg is but what's the nog?  Merry Christmas Luke! I remembered to update!!!

      WOW!  That's all I can really say about the festivities of this weekend.  It was one CRAZY weekend.   Thursday was my night with Eric (my best friend home from the Marines) and Jason. Umm...TOO much drinking that night, I was one drink away from dancing on a bar...but that's not that unusual :)  Still a bit tipsy I drove to meet up with the gals from work and have a day of beauty before the Christmas party. It was well worth it since we were SMOKING at the party. That turned into an intoxicating MESS of fun and drama. All and all we had a blast thought and I wouldn't have changed a thing.  Saturday Holly ditched Luke and I to go see 'Lord of the Rings'....so Luke bought me dinner at PF Chang. WHAT A GUY! I'll keep him. He's my favorite 20 year old but don't tell Kivi. ;) you  know I love ya Franquey, but Luke bought me Chinese! Ok, so now I'm back at work with 8 million things to do, I'll write more tomorrow if I get the time......  Later

      SO I'm a slacker....well not really.  I've been sick the last few days, now I'm playing catch up at work....BOO....best part is I'll be on vacation till the 22nd!  Ok maybe it's not good for you who want to read about my life, but, it is for me who works all the time!  See you when I get back! I'll tell you all about the drunken Christmas party for work!

      So Holly's B-day was a success. It had it's ups and downs, but all in all....Holly went home a knowing she was leaving her past behind and that she had a bunch of good new friends to help her into her future. She's great and I'm glad we could be there for her to make her realize that sometimes ex's suck! :) BUT that is why we call them EX'S!  So, I've decided to make some changes in my life recently, mainly because I've had a headache from since Friday due to stress. I'm going to spend a lot more of my time in.  (not like I have ALOT of time, but you know what I'm saying.) I need to cut a few people out of my life that are dragging me down. (don't worry Luke I'm not taking about you or anyone else at Bennigan's).  I worry too much about people that don't give a damn about me I've come to realize. I don't want to share my life with anyone who doesn't want to share their life with mine.  As my best friend Beth said to me, don't share you bed with anyone that doesn't want to share theirs. (that's not sexual by the way) Ok, before I start going on and on about it ... which normally I would, but my head hurts too much today .. I'm going to stop now.  Anyway, my weekend besides Holly's B-day pretty much sucked, I got ONE load of laundry done because my head was pounding too intensely for me to keep taking the trek up and down the stairs so I stayed all day in bed pretty much trying to block out all light  from making it's way towards my eyes in fear of the pain intensifying.  YEAH! GREAT WEEKEND!

      Hey...hey...hey!  The weekend is almost here and it couldn't have come soon enough.  It's Holly's B-day tomorrow so that should be fun. We plan to go to her 'other' place of business. Just to be nice for her b-day...buy Holly's movie people!! She was in Shortcut Road. A 'B Horror' flick check it out www.shortcutroad.com. She does 'fake' a blow-job scene in it so you guys might like it! SHES A HOTTIE :)  Anyway, I'm planning on getting alot done this weekend so I don't have to do anything NEXT week when I have off ... let's see how it goes....  Have a happy weekend....someone get drunk for me!

      Ok so I'm not so computer savvy....some of my pictures didn't come up the way they were supposed to, I'll ask Tom for help, he's my computer tech :) But I am proud of myself for creating the link!  Well, I've gotten some replies to the MASS e-mail I sent out about the BLOG. Mostly good...some are strange, some are even from people I haven't heard from in AGES I didn't even remember were in my address list till they replied (right Joel?). But all in all, I've gotten rave reviews :)  Kivi/Franquey I see checked out my pictures...and left a nice public comment about Tracy (a fellow co-worker) can't say I disagree...but I didn't make it public (wait I just did!). But he should be proud....he gave my site it's name. He's the one who calls me Dawncandy.  It's a LONG story I'm not sure should ever be explained unless face to face cause it wouldn't come out right on the Blog....but let's put it this way, Kivi also likes to randomly text me lyrics to 'Pour some sugar on me' and call me a MILF (and I'm not a mom!) so go figure. I love the kid though (even with his tendencies to pass out and make me take over his tables on busy nights) so we'll keep him and give props where props are due.  So I'm taking a little vacation time, just to forewarn everyone. Next week I took the 18th-21st off. Not a LONG vacation, but long enough for someone who works two jobs six days a week.  Some family is coming in for some pre-holiday festivities. I'm happy, but not thrilled for sometimes I feel the need to beat the snot out of members of my family. I sometimes don't think they're as appreciative as they could be and they seem to always be asking for something. BUT...the other reason why I took off is my best friend is coming home for a month starting this Friday.  Eric is in the Marines and proudly serving our country. He's already been overseas and back, they're letting come home for a month cause when he goes back to Cali, they're shipping him off again. Now I'm worried/scared/down right panicked, but at the same time calm cause Eric is the type that is too stubborn to die because he has to always prove someone wrong. I suppose that doesn't stop random bombing, but still. I have faith so I know he'll be ok.  Ok, now he's were I talk about this holiday season. If you don't want to hear it scroll NOW.........  Now that those people are gone I'll have my little discussion with well....myself....but you reading this too. I went Christmas shopping last night for the first time this year. First of all I HATE the mall on normal weekends, let alone holiday shopping weekends.   What's with the moodiness of the holidays anyway. I feel the need to cancel Christmas because people forget that it's about spending time with the one's you love, not spending money on the one's you love, like, know, and somewhat know but haven't seen in a while but would feel bad if you didn't send them a fruitcake or something.   I have determined the holidays do three things to most people. Make them angry, broke, and rude. My older brother gets like this BIG time. Now I remember growing up and seeing the cheesy Christmas movies and the 'Grinch' and such and I remember the whole trying to teach the 'meaning' of Christmas. Now never in those meaning did it say whomever gives the bigger gift of the season wins.   That's what it's like now a days though. Everyone going out spending money they don't have to impress their family, friends, and what not. Personally, I don't have that kind of money so I get stuff for the kids (meaning my nieces and nephews) and I get jazzed cause I get to go home and spend some time with my family. I like playing board games with the kids and drinking beers with my brothers.   I think in order to understand what the holidays are about you need to be broke and in debt like me. I can only afford to spend so much money...in reality I can't even afford that but I can't tell a 5 y/o I'm in credit card debt.....and that's all I spend.  I don't feel bad about it, I wish I could do more not because I want to impress anybody, but because I like to watch the kids open presents. It's fun. But I'm also not about  to rack my brain for 6 months trying to pay for what I bought. It just wouldn't make sense.   Ok, ok....I'm done talking about the commercialism of Christmas. (note I did not bring religion into this for a reason.) Oh just one more thing though, if your going to take your kids shopping with you, letting run wild around the stores in NOT a good idea. Target is not one big Gymboree! That's how kids get kidnapped and or hurt and parents sit there and say things like "I don't know how this could've happened." and "I only turned my back for a second." FYI...It only takes a second!  Done...  So anyway, back to the grind.....blah! (that's how I feel on this rainy day) Hello to all the new readers, and since he likes it when I mention his name.... Luke, did ya find Holly a birthday present yet?!  Till next time....

      Ok, ok, I'm a slacker. I haven't written in a few days, but no one really has the address anyway to want to read it everyday so who cares right?! Right.  So we didn't go to Denny's. Holly ended up not having to close, so Luke protested the Denny's excursion by offering to pay....so we went to Applebee's. I'm not a fan myself, but it works especially when your as hungry as I was by that time.  We laughed, we ate, we complained......all and all....great time had by all.  That was pretty much the highlight of my weekend. I know, I know.....I lead an exciting life, your jealous. The weekend ended with apartment cleaning, a visit from the P's, and dinner at Gino's East (the best pizza in Chicago!).   Who wouldn't be wiped out after all that excitement!  Anyway, after work last night, I got home right around 10pm. I did the usual brushing of the teeth and washing up before crawling into the sack for some TV to put me to sleep. What I discovered however is the immense amount of crap there is on TV now-a-days. Not like this is something NEW, but it seemed to really fire me up last night and I really started thinking about it.  For one, Howard Stern should stick to RADIO. Who ever thought it was a good idea to put this trash talking overly hormonal geek on TV was an idiot as far as I'm concerned. I mean seriously how many times do I HAVE to hear this guy ask some chick to take off her top/pants/etc.  NOW I have to actually watch the dumb chick DO it. (in squiggly censored vision that is) Mind you it's not like Howard is a looker either! There's a guy who went into radio for a reason!  Then of course there's the whole 'Wild On' show that usually comes on right before or after Howard intellectual hour.  It should properly be called 'Drunk girls who take their clothes off and make out with each other'.  Who watches this crap and thinks....damn I need to go there! Well besides drunk frat boys and girls looking to be in the next 'Girls Gone Wild' video. I'm always up for a good time, and trust me I've been drunk, sometimes to the point of the random flashing.....really who hasn't.....but I don't think it has a place on basic cable for cripes sakes.   I remember a time when you could NOT see this kind of thing on TV unless it was on HBO in the LATE night hours. Now there's sex all over primetime. And people as what happened to the innocence of or children....HELLO people it's called you let them watch crap like this! I myself grew up on 'I Love Lucy' re-runs and 'The Cosby Show'. Where my niece and nephew grow up with 'Will and Grace'.   Don't get me wrong, I really like 'Will and Grace', but I don't think it's appropriate for a 12 year old. Just like all the violent games and shows for kids. Seriously now, we had Duck Hunt and Mario and the Smurfs......they have Vice City and the Power Rangers.....Hmmmm.....I think someone had a screw loose when they make a game of stealing cars, killing people, and raping hookers for POINTS! Can't say I think that's ok at all, but I can say sometimes kids confuse reality with this "game" since everything is so life like now....and well they we end up with kids beating the crud or even killing kids cause they don't quite understand the consequences. They know it's wrong, but not sure why...hmmmm.....how about a little parenting and showing your kids how to use their imagination they haven't seemed to have developed because they are to busy numbing their brains with mindless/preverted/violent TV and video games.  Anyway, I'll stop that tangent....I'm sure in the long run someone will read this get mad and tell me I know nothing about how hard it is to raise a child since I don't have any....your right I don't. But I've taken care of enough, and I have a big family so I know a little something. Besides, they're just opinions, so calm yourself. This is my place to vent my frustrations.....get your own blog if you don't like it. :)

      So our IS dept. has gone a dad bit overboard on the blocking of materials lately. I understand the blocking of the prono, but seriously we can't get into anything that may have offensive language, sports, or as they say "unauthorized content", meaning basically ANYTHING on the internet. Some of it doesn't even make sense. Like I can get to www.thesmokinggun.com , but if I try to go into the archives...."blocked for pronography" PRONO?!! In the smoking gun! Where cause I missed it! It's a bunch of legal documents for christ sake! Geezz....get a life IT!

      You know what sucks about working in a one horse town? You find people you would really like to hang with, but nothing in damn open later than midnight here.   Granted for NORMAL people this isn't a problem, but when you work in the restaurant industry it IS a problem.   I'll lay it out since I just made this public for those of you who don't know what's going on. I work at Bennigans, on Saturday nights I always make plans with fellow co-workers Holly and Luke (anything from movies to grabbing a bite and such). We hang, we laugh, we talk, it's, quite frankly, a great time. How many people can you talk about the 80's with in your car in a parking lot till 3am......  Anyway, here the problem, we work in a town that basically shuts down at the stroke of midnight. Normally were out by 9 or 10, so this isn't a problem...this week Holly is closing and we close at 11, the ealiest she'll be out is 11:30. It's really not late, but it basically ruins any plans of catching a flick or eating in town.   Now, I know what your thinking go to a local pub....well that's the kicker Luke is a youngin'. Love him, but he's not of the legal drinking age until Oct. '04. Besides, even though I can party with the best of them....getting blitzed after 9 to 11 hours of waitressing with nothing in my stomach isn't my idea of a good night.   My solution to this 'problem'.....Denny's. I myself can not STAND Denny's unless it's 4:30am I'm buzzed and I can just point to the picture of the food I want, but if I want to hang with my buds (and I do)...Denny's it is.   Luke suggests we go to his house, cause he lives in the area, but something about walking into a 20y/o's parents house with 2 chicks one 25 and the other 26 doesn't seem very comfortable to me.   Granted we're friends AND ONLY friends, just doesn't seem right to walk past the parents with a don't mind us were just going to watch movies......Why don't we go to Holly's/or my apartment??....well we live on oppisite ends of the planet from each other (I in Chicago her in the Northwest suburbs)  Denny's.....I've resorted to Denny's for a Saturday night. I'm not sure if that makes me a big loser or not, but I'm ok with that....the company will make it well worth it :)   .....I'll have the 'Moons over my Hammy' please......

      So my good news of the day is I bought a new dress for our very fancy dancy Christmas (opps sorry that's not PC) correction....HOLIDAY party here for my day job.   For those of you who don't know I do work two jobs, assistant by day, waitress by night.....  I'm excited cause I haven't had a reason to buy a new dress since Prom of '96 (DAMNIT dated myself again) and because the whole sohpicication (mmm...spelling??) of the 40's/50's is coming back so my dress is very Audrey Hepburn 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' type. Kelly (my fellow asst and bay mate) even made me get a mini tiara to put in my up-do we plan on getting that night by the hair school by the hotel.  Ok yes, it seems like were going a little tinsy bit far with this whole holiday party thing, but geez when the hell do we get to get dressed up and look fancy? When Tony takes me to O'Donovan's the Irish pub down the street, I think not he's not even worth the trouble. Or better yet my "dates" with Luke and Holly (Bennigan's co-workers)to the movies on Saturday nights....mmmm something tells me I'd be a bit out of place.   So sue me, I'm excited.

      So in my wonderful job that I love SO much (that being sarcasim for those of you who are slow.) I have ALOT of customer interaction. I like to call myself a glorified customer service rep. My job titles me as sales/graphic assistant. Which basically means I do all the work EXECPT go out and bring the customers in. So for every one of my 'salemen' all 7 of them that bring in customers, they basically hand off my name and number and all these people do is call me when they want to order product or need a new graphic made or so on and so forth and I get it done.  Problem with my job is most people somehow and for some reason (maybe my salemen told them) they think I'm psychic and/or know everything there is to know about every product/graphic detail in this company. Now I admit I'm GOOD, but NOT that good.  I know it's frustrating to call somewhere and be told that the answer you were looking for can't be given to you right then and there....I've been there....but I'll tell you right now cussing me out because your damn spoons are on back order is NOT I repeat NOT going to make me get it for you any faster.  I have adopted a new policy. I'm telling people with the attitude problems that if they don't watch it Santa's going to bring them coal for Christmas.  Didn't everyone learn in like kidergarden you'll be more likely to get something from someone if you NICE than a raging manic! Two thumbs down to the crazy people yelling at Kelly and I the last two days!

      Funny thing happened while I was moving in July, I found my old diary. I'm not talking about the diary from like high school, I'm talking OLD...like 4th grade old. It had Maggie Simpson on it (does that date me?) and the things I wrote in it were just quite pondering. Like did I really think (even at the age of 10) I was ever going to care what I had for lunch, or what I did in recess/gym that day. Was it that monumental in my mind at that age? I suppose that why there are diaries....but then again I think I just felt an obligation to write in it since it was giving to me and so I wrote whatever trival detail of my life there was to write like who's butt I happened kick in tetherball that day.  Speaking of which do kids still play tetherball? That game RULED! Or is that one of those things taken from playgrounds because it was too dangerous to make our next generation of kids wusses? Whoops got off the subject....  Anyway, I decided maybe that's why I was so 'carefree' as a child, well besides the fact I had no bills to pay for, but I always wrote out everything, so why not start up a modern version. Although it's slightly different, for one I'm not hiding with it's mini padlock between my mattresses, I have a feeling that would be uncomfortable for sleeping purposes, I'm letting the world get in my head.  Ok, so it's a long shot, but it makes me feel good at least....so sit back relax, and laugh at my pathetic life (and spelling mishaps...tee..hee)

      So today at work I had a revelation that my friend Luke would LOVE to work here at my office for one reason and one reason only. We talk in codes.   Now by codes I don't mean we have a secret language, I just mean we shorten everything we can. So does Luke. Luke shortens names like SJP (Sarah Jessica Parker) or food items such as the BBP (Brownie Bottom Pie). He'll even take everyday words and shorten them like the usue (is that even how you spell it?) instead of usual. Well here at work I came to the realization we speak Luke.   I was requesting a POD (Proof of delivery) online when Todd came to deliver RGA (Return good authorizations) while I was getting a request for an ETA (estimated time of arrival) on my voice mail. Oh MY GOD I thought to myself. I've turned into Luke and his abbreviated words. (not like it's just me this is common speak in the office)  I don't know why it took this long to hit me, especially since it makes me laugh so hard when Luke and Matty P shorten words like crazy, but now that it has I can't help but to giggle a little when I have to request a POD. TeeHee.

      My god has it been busy around here. I know I know I'm a slaker and haven't written, but what the heck can you do when there's always calls coming in and salemen at your desk. Makes it hard to write don't it!  The only person I know who reads this everyday anyway is Luke so I must be REALLY letting him down. And for that Luke I'm sorry, I love ya and I'll make up for it soon I promise.  I'm taking the day off work tomorrow to do laundry and clean my house cause it's freaking me out that I haven't gotten anything done what so ever. So Friday I'll take some time to write...hopefully

      I'm a loser I keep forgetting to write. I did get a mini type promotion with no extra money today. I get more responsibility, so that's good.  But until I get a free moment ... ponder this ...  Why exactly do they call them blow jobs when you don't do anything of the sort?  Drive up teller machines with Braille? Ummm...why are the blind DRIVING!?  What is the deal with the Gen Y generation not counting oral as sex....if it has the word sex directly in it...you can factor it in the sex category.  Later peeps

      I wonder about people sometimes.   Actually I wonder about people A LOT! I wonder why they treat people the way they do and think they can get away with it. For instance I'm a waitress at night. For some reason some people think this job sets you in a category next to pond scum so therefore they can treat you like the you really don't exist. I do my best to give you good service.   Here's some advice for you people who obviously don't eat out often.   1. When I say ONE coupon per table, it doesn't mean you can get separate checks and count it as another table. It actually mean you have to sit and ANOTHER table. Were not trying to scam you, so don't keep trying to scam us.   2. I don't cook the food I serve it. I understand if something is not to your liking and if you would like me to fix it I'd be more than happy too, if and only if you ask me to in a pleasant manner. Freaking out on me is not going to make me very happy and in turn won't make you very happy. I guarantee that.  3. I will continue to check up on your table, it's part of my job, I don't mind. But DON'T, I repeat, DON'T interrupt me when I'm speaking to another table because you need more dressing. IT'S RUDE! Not only to me because I'm speaking to someone else, but to the table I'm serving. How would you like it if it was done to you....DOUBT YOU WOULD!  4. Going along with that....if I ask you if you need anything else, please ask me for everything at once. Not send me for napkins, I come back, send me for dressing, I come back, send me for a refill on your soda.....etc...etc. It's annoying not to mention takes time away from serving other people. If I ask you if you need a refill and you say no, don't ask me for one 5 minutes later. Let me refill your drink then when I have time. Not 5 minutes from now when I'm trying to take a table of 8's order.   5. Speaking of large parties.....CALL A RESTAURANT before you and the fam show up. If there's more than 6 people, you should always call a restaurant and let them know your coming. It's only fair, that way we can have a table waiting for you, you don't have to give the host attitude because we can't accommodate you at that moment, and everyone ends up happy in the long run. Side note with those parties, don't make me stand there if you all aren't ready to order. Just because YOUR ready doesn't mean everyone else is. When the place if full I don't have time to stand at your table staring at 2 people while they try and decide if they want the Monte or the Ruben. IF your not ready, I'll come back, I don't mind. I do mind standing there like an idiot staring at you while you try and make up your mind.  6. This actually goes along with both of my jobs. DON'T tell me how to do my job! I've been waiting tables for almost 11 years, I'm pretty good at it. There's nothing worse than a table telling me how to wait a table. I should tell them what's in the salad cause they didn't know it came with bacon even though it states it CLEARLY on the menu. I should bring ranch and blue cheese with their wings cause not everyone likes blue cheese. (or as my day job goes...they don't need a customer # to order, they never have before....well no one can order with out an account so YES you DO!) I'm not a mind reader, I don't know what you like. And frankly if your that picky and need every modification in the world....EAT AT HOME. Unless you've lived in a hole the last 10 years your aware of the Ecoli virus, I can't cook your burger rare...SORRY....Bennigan's the corporation won't chance it. So don't tell me I can just go back in the kitchen and tell the cook to cook it less. Trust me Jose will tell me NO and laugh at me cause I know better.   and finally (for now) 7. If you go to a restaurant and you see it closes at 11 and you show up at 10:45....DON'T GO IN! It's ridiculous (or ask those of us at the Bennigans say ricockulous) The kitchen gets pissed they have to dirty the kitchen they just clean, I'm pissed cause I have to sit there for another hour while you take you sweet time to eat an pay. If you see a place is closing within minutes....don't torture the place by going in an having a casual dinner. Quick to go...maybe, but sitting there for an hour after the doors are locked and chairs are up NOT COOL. Most of us have day jobs that we would like to get some sleep for before I have to go to it!   Ok, ranting over....I feel better educating you all a little....back to work for me.

      So have you ever done something you know is wrong, but you just can't help doing it? Maybe it's the whole excitement value of it, maybe it's the thrill of getting caught doing something naughty. I don't know what it is about it, but it's just such a rush you don't know how to stop the down hill spiral once it's started.   Now I'm not getting into detail about it so don't ask...I like to keep people guessing, besides, I'm not positive I'm going to do ANYTHING yet. It's just up in the air, and that up in the air stuff can be pretty interesting in itself. (NO I'm NOT having an affair even if everyone in my office thinks so.)   I can just see Luke and Kivi busting their buttons trying to figure it all out. Well, maybe someday I'll tell you, but for right now I'm just semi writing about it to get it out of my own head. I'm come to realize although my life is quite boring I do some weird things to make it interesting at times.....

      Not much to update ya'll on today. I discussed with Holly about living with her for a few months in her one bedroom until we can get a larger place in Oct when her lease is up. She thinks it's a pretty good idea, so it may just work for us. We'll see how things go as the time gets closer.  My roomie is continually making my life frustrating. But what else is new. Now she's started eating the meals I pre-pack for myself. Now how slow do you have to be to realize they are packed in individual little containers for a reason! DUH! Soon I will be rid of her, then she's Roger's problem. I started looking into movers, and GEEZ are they expensive. Anyone know some nice strong guys willing to help me move from my 3rd floor apartment in June?   Well, check ya later.....

      So I work out everyday before I eat lunch. Nothing TOO great but I do a mile then some easy lifting to cool down. Everyday it's been getting easier and easier....Hopefully soon I'll start seeing some results! :)    Between my new diet and my workouts I can tell you I do feel a lot better. It relieves a lot of tension for me I can tell you that. And since at the age of 26 I have slightly high blood pressure...tension relief is a GOOD thing. It's mostly because I work 2 pretty high stress jobs. But I'm doing what I can to improve it.  My pops is comin' to visit me at the Bennigans tonight. I haven't seen my family since Christmas so this is a good thing. I'm going to talk to him some about me POSSIBLY moving into his place while I'm homeless for 4 months thanks to the roomie movin' out earlier than originally planned. They MAY go for it, they MAY not. It's still a debate. I don't really want to since my parents are in Wisconsin and the commute to work will be horrendous....but what can you do. And it's only from June 1st till Oct 1st right! It'll save me some $$ too then I'll be able to afford my security deposit and such without a problem.  Of course I'll have to pay mom and pops rent to live there, but nothing like an ACTUAL apartment. Plus my mom cooks. I'll be able to help my mom out too without wanting to kill somebody like my roommate. Let's just cross our fingers and hope it works out. Maybe maybe maybe.   I'll be talkin' to Holly tonight too about moving. Just to make sure that's still what she wants to do otherwise I'll be looking for my own place.....that'll set me back! Alright....hasta for now. I got lots of work to do.

      I think I may be officially homeless for 4 months from June 1st to Oct 1st. My plan was to move with Holly (and Luke) in October. Well since my roommate just sprung the big news about her wanting to leave in April. I'm stumped as to what to do.   I can get her to pay the rent till June 1st. When our non-existent lease is up. But from June to Oct when Holly's lease is up. I'm in limbo!! I tried to discuss with the rents about me living there for a few till Holly's lease is up...but so far they're still considering it. (Layman's terms for they really don't want me back even for the 4 months!) I offered to pay and I think that helped so I'm crossing my fingers I'm not sleepin' from couch to couch when June comes.   You wouldn't believe how stress of a living situation can put on a gal! I'm ready to cry and put my fist through a wall at the same time. OH AND I found out that there's a rumor going around about me having an affair with a married guy at work. He's not even rich so way would I be.....kidding.....I have morals but I guess the people here don't care. Well, raspberries to them!!!  Later peeps....

      So a new week has begun! I really hate Mondays for the only reason that it seems every stupid person in the WORLD call here on Mondays. Some of them even get confused when you ask them where they are calling from. I didn't think that was a HARD question. But I suppose it is to much to ask someone what the name of the company they work for is.  So I had a pretty good weekend. All and all...good, except for my 'roomie' incident. Saturday I went to the jewelry show...that would have been WAY more fun if I actually had money to spend. But I did get to look at a lot of really nice stuff so it was fun. I dropped my friends off and went to nap for a bit. When I got up my roomie decided to inform me she's moving out in April instead of October. That's a full SIX months before I actually expected her to. So bottom line, I'm stressin' about the whole roommate thing right now. I did go out with Holly and Luke that night, so it calmed me down and made me forget my troubles for the moment.   Sunday I spent most of the day cleaning and cooking. I happen to be known as a huge pack rat. I keep everything....it's about time that stopped. Especially as much as I've been moving the last 3 years. I cleaned out a lot of old notes, Christmas/Birthday cards and such. I kept on to some of it. But I took 4 HUGE boxes down to 2 moderately sized ones so I'm pretty proud of that....  The cooking you ask?  Well, I'm trying to change my eating habits into healthier ones. Since I work all the time, it's hard to cook everyday. So I made preprep meals and snacks for myself. Grilled up some tasty chicken  on my G. Foreman grill (did I mention I love this thing!). I cut up some veggies and such and now I have 5 days worth of fruit, chicken for my salad, cottage cheese, veggies and salad fixins! I'm so proud of myself! I never actually thought about doing that until my dietian suggested it. It seems like I would have thought of it before, but sometimes I'm not all that swift.  It's worked out well for me so far...lets see if I can stick with it.

      My cold got the best of me yesterday so I stayed home. I know, I know....you missed me. But you will be happy to know I got ONE blood test results back and they were ALL GOOD! YEAH!   I go to the doc tomorrow new diet! YEAH SKINNY DAWN. Ok, I'm not a cow....but it'll be good to be in shape again. I did go to the grocery yesterday while home sick and got lots of healthy food. I made a keen observation though, why is it the healthier stuff is for you the more expensive it is. I can buy mirco burritos for like $.60...but I have to pay like $2.29 a lb for tomatoes that look half bad....doesn't make sense. They want our country to be more healthily but the only thing that's cheap is MC'D's....BOO on our economy for makin us fat!

      I hate going to the doctor. I hate it because I don't ever remember a time I've gone to the doc and they haven't told me something NEW is wrong with me.   This time I had to give up a lot of blood to be tested. Turns out my fatigue could be something pretty serious. Let me break it down for you. My doc seems to think my one kidney that works isn't filtering enough junk out of me and basically I may be getting in laymans terms 'dirty blood' flowing through my veins making me feel mighty tired most of the time. That's what happens when your body is fighting off bacteria most of the time....it makes you tired.   Hopefully when the tests come back they say that this isn't true and I'm just low on iron or something....otherwise I'm going to have to look for a donor. But we'll cross that bridge when we come to it. Don't worry guys I'll be fine. This isn't the first time I've gone through this and I'm sure it won't be the last. I'm just not looking forward to dialysis if I have to get it. That sucks. But I want to move on from those thoughts though.....  Ok, happy thoughts. Good news is I'm going to see a dietitian on Saturday. I'm pretty pumped about it. I think it's going to be good for me to start eating better instead of grabbing potato soup on the go. I looking forward to getting back into shape believe it or not! What will you people do with me when I'm hot AND thin! HAHAHAHAHA.  So by the way Luke I don't work on Saturday. We still making plans? Just wondering.....

      I disappointed Luke by not writing on the 2nd, I was busy putting my finances in order so I can finally wipe away some of this credit card debt. I'm so close, yet so FAR away. I need to stop spending money. But when your down and out and NEVER home it's easy to spend money without even realizing it......  So I started working out today. I'm starting slow and working my way up to it, but I walked 2miles uphill on the treadmill at lunch. I felt a little jello-like when I got off...but that's expected I suppose. Especially on artificial walking ground. I feel good about myself for actually doing something I said I was going to do. Now I just have to keep it up and I'll be fine. :) But, since my doctor told me to start taking care of myself or I'm going to regret it early in life....I think I'll be pretty dedicated to keeping it up.  Anyway, my new year is starting out well. No major catastrophes to report. Although I do have to figure out a way for me to separate myself from some of the life sucking people I started hanging with last year. It's easier to say your going to do it that ACTUALLY doing it. All and all they are fun to hang with....but they aren't good for my self-respect, esteem, or karma. But I'm a firm believer in what goes around comes around so....I have to do it in a way that feeling won't be damaged. Sometimes I think I purposely make my life this complicated.....  You know if you know anyone that won the lottery or came into a lot of money somehow lately....can you ask them if they could let me have $20,000? If that's asking for too much I'll take $10,000. I just want to pay this stuff off and start fresh again. No more crappy roommate I can't stand....no more credit card debt (now I know better)....no more stress of how I'm going to scrape together my car payment and still go and chill with my friends without looking like a cheapsake.....Oh well, the new year WILL be better I hope....check back I'll keep you posted on my debt relief. It is currently about   I hope Luke is glad I updated.....I have a doctor appt tomorrow so I'll be in late to work so I may not have time tomorrow...but I'll try. No Promises.

      Just so Luke doesn't keep yellin' at me about updating my blog....here goes....  First of all I heard from Kivi (in a prank phone call for collections to my work today)....his friends flipped a car and ended up unharmed so it had him thinking that's all. He's OK FOLKS!! Thank goodness.  Ok, so as I promised I'll let you all know why Valentines Day sucks. First it sucks when your alone. That goes WITH OUT saying. It sucks cause everyone is cutesy cutesy.....there's love crap EVERYWHERE you look....for no apparent reason ex's start crawling out of the woodwork to try and 'get back together' when it was stupid you even got together in the first place....everyone at work is getting deliveries and your desk lies empty...BLAH BLAH BLAH...those are obvious reasons Valentines is a crappy holiday. It big o' reminder you ALONE!  My theory on things though it that it also sucks when your with someone too. Why you ask? Well I'll be more than happy to tell you :)  I think people to TOO much hoopla around the whole thing! Girls say they don't want anything (but they do)...Guys have the pressure of obligation on them. They end up getting some stupid gifts for each other when in actuality they don't even want to. Basically here's the jist of it. If you can't get something for your significant other on Tuesday cause it's Tuesday and you feel OBLIGATED to do it on Valentines....your in the wrong relationship. Why in the heck do I want some guy to send me flowers (that die) and candy (that adds ten pounds to my hips I've been trying to loose since New Years) or some card you don't even REALLY know what it says but you picked it anyway because you just assumed I'd like it.   I would on ANY occasion have someone send me flowers to work on Thursday cause they thought it would brighten my day, rather than feel like they HAVE to get me something or I'll be mad. That's STUPID! I don't want someone walking on pins and needles stressing over what to get me or what I might say or if I'll like it. I'd rather have someone walking through the mall, department store, or cripes even the DRUGSTORE and think....huh I know Dawn would really like that...I'm going to get it for her. Gifts mean so much more from the heart than they do from the wallet. Remember that! Anyway, I'm leaving work in like 20 min. I gotta work! This was WAY quicker explanation than I wanted it to be but, at least no one can yell I didn't update! *cough*Luke*cough* Sorry ... seems I must have a frog in my throat. Later and Happy Valentines anyway! :)

      By the way, I got a strange IM from Kivi over the weekend, I think something is up with him that I'm not aware of. It was really nice and sweet, but I'm not sure why he felt the need to send it. So Franquey if your reading, give this chicka a call sometime....she worries about you :)

      On Friday night I got to see some people I haven't seen in forever. I've know Jeremy and Jason since I was 13 y/o, but since we've all grown up I haven't gotten a chance to hang with them in a while.   I got to meet my best friend Jeremy's new fiance. Considering the fact that I literally HATED his ex wife, I was pleasantly surprised that I love his new fiance. I'm SO glad he's happy and he found a great chick to be with. Funny how sometimes my personality can be over barring to people I just met. I tried to tune it down for her, but she was the one dragging me on stage to dance so NICE! I LOVED that!  So the weird thing was while I was with Jeremy and Jason my friends for the last 13 years, a guy at the bar tapped me on the shoulder and proceed to ask me if my name was Dawn. Well, yes.....then I took a good look at him and it turns out it was Mike, my neighbor when I was growing up. Now I've known that kid since I was like 3. Ironic that your with old friends you haven't seen in years and you run into someone you haven't seen in even longer! It was pretty cool though I have to admit. I hope Mike does get ahold of me, it would be cool to hang with him again.   Well that night I pulled a hamstring trying to catch Stacy when she fell, I ended up falling in the splits for the most part. HURTS!!!! But it's getting better, tried to run today, but I ended up just walking since my leg was still quite sore. Other than that it's been my normal BUSY day at NA. (that's North American not Narcotic Anonymous!) Sorry it's so short, but later in the week I'll write about Valentines and why it's such a crappy holiday, with or without a sweetie.

      Huh, you would think since I haven't written in a few days I'd have some brilliant revelation to tell you.....but I don't, no big huge news....BORING DAWN!!!!  Oh, I got to meet my Starbucks boyfriend! That's news! Explanation for those of you who are a little in the dark....I work at a company that distributes all the paper products/cleaning supplies for Starbucks. Well, in the last few months this one guy from Starbucks just happened to get me every time he called to order. It started us chatting, and chatting, and chatting.....next thing you know, he came up to Bennigan's to meet me.   Ok, can you say pressure. You chat with a guy every week have NO clue what he looks like, he show up to your place of business that you look the worst at....but all was good. Gals he definitely was not a disappointment :)  He could only stay for a few, and he was off, but it was a good meeting none the less. He asked me what I was doing tonight......I'm still considering......  That's my news folks, sorry it's not that big! Love ya :)

      So I have a new obsession....it's a stupid purse.  http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P60001  Yep, that's my new obsession. I won't buy it cause it's not worth $45 dollars for a purse I might use a few times....but I am obsessed with taking about this purse. Look how cute it is! It's a mini corset, what's not to love! Ok, ok.....I'll be dropping the subject now since I've been talking about the damn purse for 2 days now. I'm crazy, but when I see something that cute I have to talk about it until I get it out of my system. I figure if I tell everyone I know who reads this thing....then it's out.  Beth you can't tell me this purse isn't TOO cute!    Ok this time I'm REALLY done...... urlLink

      Ok, so I made a friend update, so here I go.....  Update is I have 2 jobs that keep me DAMN busy since one I'm SWAMPED at with customers calling and salesmen barking, and the other I'm SWAMPED when I'm there cause I have 2 retards working there who don't know their ace from a hole in the ground. Luke says they must be 'Punking' us.....I'm waiting for Ashton to pop out...he hasn't I'm disappointed to be stuck with the losers. Even when Kivi passed out he gave us fair warning first! These guys are just brain dead.   But just to make him feel better....Kivi....you have to be good enough for Blockbuster if Lloyd can get a job at Gamestop, you can get a job at Blockbuster.....you don't even get drunk and high EVERY day. Although that could be a requirement for your new job, you may want to check in with that. And if you do get a jobby job at the blockbuster, will you hook up the discount action for Luke and I's movie rental night?  Ok ok I really do have work to do....I got a burlesque show to go to tonight and a birthday in one week from today to try and get people together for.  Hasta.....If you want to send presents for the BDAY....email me I'll tell you where to send them :)

      I hate myself today. I haven't said that since high school, but I really do hate myself today. I think it's going to be one of those days I'm not going to be able to stop crying if I try no matter what anybody says. It seems to be pick on Dawn day.....so far I've gotten the I don't dress to standards at work (and if I want to flaunt it I better look for another place to work) and the 'we're all aware your struggling with your weight' speech. ALL IN ONE LECTURE!!! Yah! I'm a fat ass who can't dress!   I want to go home now....bad....I can't stop crying...so I'll just stare at my screen pretend to work the best I can, and blubber like an idiot. I'm just so mad I'm taking this so personally ... I think it's the weight and the pointing out that my boobs are a little excessive at the same time...well damn what the hell am I supposed to to with them! They're there, I can't just tuck them away. I really do wish I could sometimes I really miss the 32AA I once was. If these were a boob job, I'd have them removed.  Enough, I'm off to blubber and feel sorry for myself for a moment. I love you hon, thanks for trying to make me feel better. Your the best.

      Ho Hum life is so boring sometimes. Especially when your stuck in the routine that I'm in, work/pack/sleep.....(and the occasional couple of hours with the man in my life). As most of you know I've never been much of a good sleeper....damn that whole chemical imbalance!....but lately it's been even WORSE! Last night was the first time I fell asleep before midnight in FOREVER...but of course our very own timberkivi decided to wake me up with the 11 o'clock because he heard 'Pour some sugar on me'. BOO Kivi BOO!!!!  Ok, so needless to say I'm a little bummed about my move, packing up all my stuff just makes me depressed. I'm going to be furthest away from everything I love (except you honey) and it just depresses the hell out of me. As long as everything goes smoothly I'll be ok, I'll be a wreck until it does, but I'll be ok once it all settles.   So Kivi, your still in pursuit I see. Well, my advice, just let the cards fall where they may. If you push, people tend to push back. As for your non social life, well, stop letting the fam plan your life and maybe you could make plans with the rest of the real world :)  I'm sorry if Monday,Wednesday, and Fridays having dinner with me at Benigga's isn't good enough for you. There's always Saturday, you could come hang with me all day!!(tee...hee)  I gotta work....hasta

      You know there are some people in my life I'm damn thankful are there. Although some of my friends are young, they are still smart beyond there years at times. And some of them are older and still large children and that's a trait I resemble myself.  Sometimes they take me back a bit by saying things I just wouldn't expect but are truly nice and sweet. (That's right Kivi I'm talkin' about you)  But sometimes, I just don't understand my friends. Don't get me wrong I'd pretty much do anything (besides kill a man, sleep with farm animals, or....well there is actually A LOT I wouldn't do....) for my friends and I'd like to think they'd do the same for me. If they don't feel what I was doing was right, they'd tell me, or if they were hurt by something I said/did, they'd tell me. That's what being a friend is. Being able to tell someone they're a F@#* up and knowing that all and all your going to be friends in the long run. It's also about supporting your friends even if they aren't doing exactly what you would have expected them to.   It is NOT however about giving someone the funked up silent treatment! If your my friend YELL AT ME! I make mistakes in my life and they are MINE to make. Right now I'm the happiest I have ever been in my entire life. I'm in love with a wonderful man who loves me more than I could ever have imagined. I know he's married, I'm the one who has to deal with that on a daily basis. If it was a typical marriage situation I would feel horrible, but it's not so I only feel somewhat horrible. I battle my own demons everyday....I don't need my friends suddenly not speaking to me with no explanation as to why.  I know your upset, but would you rather have me lie about it?! I value each and every one of my friends like part of my family, when they treat me like trash to be discarded, it makes me feel as though they never even cared in the first place.   I've been around the block quite a few times I've had a lot of people who claimed to be my friends walk out of my life without a second thought, so I'm not about to beg for you to be my friend, but I wanted you to know I have had some of the best times I've ever had with you. I'd like to keep you as part of my life, but if you can't accept me into your life anymore, I understand too. This isn't how I planned things, it's just the way the cards were dealt........  Ok, Ok, Kivi....the part you've been waiting for....your advice. I know Steve, I love Steve, you two are my comedic relief with your completely opposite personalities....yet your so alike...funny how that happens. I know that not much bothers Steve, he's one of the most patient people I know, I suppose you have to be when your the worlds slowest eater. So here the thing, it doesn't seem as though Steve and this girl dated for long but still there's probably some uncomfortablness there. One, your right you have no wheels, you would have to depend on others for a ride...so until you  get your license back your kinda stuck. Two, can you really enter into a relationship with someone who doesn't like your best friend...yes, but will it work out....no, even if it does for a period of time there's always that feeling of being pulled in two different directions....one by your friend of forever, and the other by the girl your trying to date.   My thinking is since I know you is that maybe your starting to like this gal cause she's a cool chick to hang with and now you 'think' you have feelings towards the relationship standings since your (no offence) desperate for affection. Trust me I've been there. Tried to push a relationship with someone I thought was "perfect" for me and we would make a good couple....when really we just made good friends. I think you need to sit back and REALLY think about the whole thing. Right now I think you need to straighten out a few priorities in your life before you try and enter into a relationship anyway. I.E. looking further into getting your license back,  paying off the psycho ex-roomies dad, you just started a new job you love...so let's try and get hired from temp status, and even looking into taking some classes Mr. College Drop out. Trust me when your the happiest with yourself, is when things just seem to oddly fall into place.  That's what happened to me....granted making life difficult now, but trust me.  I love you Kivi (and Stevie too), but I think your at a part in time with your lives your just now discovering yourselves.  Trust me I was there it's a weird age, trying to be an adult and a kid at the same time ain't easy (just ask Dayne.)....but romance isn't something you NEED in your life, it's something you want (who wouldn't) but being alone isn't bad at all either. You both have some great friends, wonderful families, and ME :) ok I was tooting my own horn....but seriously...having a relationship isn't easy...AT ALL...and in order to enter into one I think you really need to work on you first. Be happy being single work on your future a little. Not that you have to figure it all out in the next year, but think about it, is bringing a gal into your life right now really fair when you have so much extra baggage on your hands?   Ok, this is like the longest post ever! And I'm sure it's going to cause problems for me some where....but regardless....I always speak my mind, and hell that's what my blog is for. To a certain someone I'm sure is reading this with Kivi in the warehouse. I love you and don't you forget it!    Till next time!......

      So I haven't updated in a long time. I've had a lot going on, most of which I won't get into. I have way to much on my plate right now and I'm not sure if I'm going to go insane from it all or just break down and cry hysterically. Why is it I like to get myself in the most ridiculous (or ricockulous as Luke/Matt/and Erik would say) situations.  I suppose it's because I like to beat myself up in the long run.   So basically for those of you who don't know (which by now I don't know how you don't) I fell in love, shocker I know, ME of all people actually falling in love. Except just like every other relationship I've EVER had there's a problem. He's British....(that's not the problem)...he's married.  By married I mean married to stay in the country and get his citizenship, not married made a lifetime commitment to this women because he loved her. Now I know it goes against EVERYTHING I stand for and everything I've ever preached about when my caddy girlfriends were flirting around with married men with power. This man has NOTHING so it's not like I'm going after anything....he works hard for everything he has, provides for his wife...and her daughter (NOT HIS)....he has two kids back in England he still takes care of....and best of all....he loves me with all of his heart. It's hard to believe, but if you met him and talked to him for more than 5 min....you would know too. I've come very close to walking out of this crazy situation a million times. The whole relationship makes me sick to my stomach, the lies, the sneaking around, the once a cheater always a cheater thoughts in my mind. This whole thing makes me want to tear my hair out on a daily basis. But then when I'm with him all of that doesn't seem to matter cause I know how much he cares for me and I've never felt anyone care about me like that before. Now I'm sure your thinking how in the world did it even start if you knew he was married, LONG story if you want to know that one you'll have to call or email me. It wasn't like I woke up one day and decided to be with him....it was much more complicated than that...and has spanned over the last year before anything happened between us..... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR ok, ok, ok, had to get it all out. Now my friends and family reading this think I'm insane cause no one has ever known me to act like this or be so weak in a situation..... but I guess they were right when they said love makes you do strange things!  By the way, Timberkivi hasn't updated his blog, but he has a jobby job now for any of you who were wondering. He works with my Brit, I got him a job with him here at North American. So he can't complain anymore. Besides he's doing so much real work now, he's shedding some pounds....of course it's because he walks into the building and starts instantly sweating, but hey it's the shedding of pound none the less!   I gotta go, I'm sure I'll get EMAILS on this blog so I'll talk to you all later. By the way Luke, I miss hanging with you. Are you mad at me? I understand if it's with this whole situation, but I still love ya your my favorite! No one could ever replace you!

      I'm addicted to Brian Walsh's middle drawer. (HONEY CLAM DOWN!!! I SAID DRAWER NOT DRAWERS!!!) You see this guy in purchasing has the drawer of goodies. Like lemon drops and Dove chocolate but the best of all Twizzlers....I'm addicted to these stupidly good strawberry treats! I try to pretend I don't know anything about this drawer, but it's useless, it pull me toward it and next thing you know I'm cramming this twisted sugary treats in my mouth.  At least they're a fat free snack......

      So work has been 'interesting' to say the least. I'm been working my butt off, but I have a couple of gals who think they're still in high school trying this, let's get her in trouble routine. Funny thing is my boss knows better so I'm not real worried. I personally liked the whole instance where they said I didn't know how to work customer service....huh that's interesting, I've been working in the restaurant industry for nearly 11 years and now suddenly I don't know how to take care of customers. INTERESTING....you would think in that amount of time someone would have told me that. Oh well as Dayne says....Fuck em. I'm out to by myself a new CD player for work so I don't even have to here thier voices if I don't want to ... YAY....

      ....pour some sugar on me!  I'm sick. Really sick. Not fever sick, but can't walk ten feet without feeling like I'm going to pass out and gasping for air sick. Which mind you makes waitressing really 'easy'. I decided to break down and go to the doctor today. Although I don't want to, I need to. Since the Mac Grill, Chili's, Applebee's and On the Border have all closed down we've been up 75% to 80% at Bennigans. It's going to be BUSY this weekend when the town finds out Mac Grill and Chili's are now closed too....BOO...I mean YAY for the money, but boo for the running around when I already can't breathe. Hence the going to the doc to break some of this congestion up so I can breathe easier this weekend. Ok, Kivi, I updated for you....even though you found other friends to hang with last night.

      Have you ever had a day where it's possible that you could kill just about everyone you work with and just burst into tears at any moment from the amount of stress you have? I'm having that today.....but, even though he probably doesn't want the world to see it...I'm posting it anyway, this is what I get to cheer me up from my baby:   I know you probably don’t need to here this right now babe but I have to tell you anyway. Please don’t let these cocksuckers get you down; you’re worth so much more than any of them give you credit for, and your worth at least a million whore, bitch, slut, idiot, bimbo, demented crazy fucking nut job Kelly. So baby please please please know that you are my absolute world and you’re a very good egg and as much as this place and the people in it piss us off we both need this place right now (I really don’t know what I’d do if you left) so please try and forget about the idiots and there stupidity and remember I love you so much it hurts and when I see you like this it almost tear’s me apart. There are two things you can be sure of Dawn, you work with a bunch of fucking retards and you have a man whole loves you more than life itself (or anything it has to offer for that matter). So baby cakes, cheer up, I know it’s not much but you do have me   That just makes everything all better! I'm one lucky gal!

      ....Been chillin' at the Holiday Inn....(ok, I lie, it was the Excel Inn)  ***BUSTED***  So as my favorite Enlishmen and I were preparing for our weekend together (i.e. loading up my car with stuff at the Kohl's parking lot) we were unexpectedly caught by our resident psycho.   Yes, we have been outed! Granted we were kissing cause it looks as though a LOT is coming together with the sepatation of the wife and all, but I don't think either one of us expected to be caught like we were.   It's Wednesday though and everything is ok as far as work goes. I told a few people that I like and respect at work so they wouldn't be offended by hearing via rumor. But all and all Dayne and I are pretty happy we can finally call each other boyfriend/girlfriend out loud without worrying if someone will hear and tell the wrong person.   YAY!   The  urlLink  Fat Kid had his 21st birthday so were proud that he's all growed up (even if his mom did call and try and make him come home). I do have a video of him riding the bull at Gameworks, but I think the kid ruined his tummy the night before by puking too much so not much drinking ensued. We did have video game playing fun even if everyone else punked out (losers!)  So I'm off (starting tomorrow) to housesit for the next 10 days for my bro who's off to Cali with the wife and kids. I'm not exactly thrilled considering I have to be FURTHER from work than I want to be, but I'll live....and I get to spend a little extra time with Daynecakes. (it still doesn't sound right unless it comes from Matt.) YAY.....I'll keep ya posted...  And in case Beth is reading...email me Eric's email address please :)  Love ya baby!

      ....nothing left for me to do but DANCE.  Let's start off with a BIG O' SORRY to my bestest friend Beth for me not keepin' her more informed on my life. I hate having such a hectic schedule I can't even find time to call people anymore! You and I need to have dinner. SOON! And considering the fact you've been with your man for how long now DAMN....and I've been with mine for 6 months now (yep it's been 6 months!) we should really arrange to meet each others significant others.   I'm up in Pleasant Prairie right now (which I LOVE....sarcasim in case you didn't figure that one out....) and your man is in Lake Geneva, we should meet up for dinner on a Sunday we all have free (before the Faire starts cause I couldn't be nor could I drag Dayne to the Renisance Faire!)  Ok, apologies out of the way. So my soon to be roomies boyfriend gave her the boot, or should I say gave her 2 weeks notice. Situation goes Andy (Holly's man) just up and decided to move to Vegas. So, Monday night, he just tells Holly he's leaving at the end of the month. He's already put in his 2 weeks at work and got an apartment out in Vegas. Now you would think after dating someone for 6 months they would give you at least the common decency to talk with you about leaving. Nope not Andy, he gave Holly 2 weeks notice instead. No offence to her but I guess that's what you get when you date a 22 year old boy! An emotionally retarded boyfriend. Needless to say, Holly's better off. She's one of the most beautiful gals I've ever met outside and in. SO therefore if there are any guys out there looking for a hot blonde....I got a newly single one. (not you Kivi, I don't care if she is on your list.)  Speaking of the Kivster....he turns 21 at midnight on Thursday! YAY! Dayne and I are using it as an excuse to get out of town and get a hotel room for a little private intimate time we can't seem to manage now that I'm back at home. Of course we'll be partyin' the night away for the fat kids B-day, but then Dayne and I are going to have our own private party for Saturday. :) YAY.  It's time to go break the receptionist, and get some more coffee so I can make it through this REALLY long day! Damn I knew I shouldn't have taken out Holly last night to drown her sorrows, although my baby is hurting more than I it seems this morning. I love you sweets. (you too Beth....and the fat kid too.)  Later....

      ...they know what it what, but they don't know what is what...  So I started bringing my headphones to work so I don't have to here about a certain red head turned blonde talk about her giant greasy jigsaw puzzle. Yes ladies and gentleman, that's what she refers to the car she just bought to fix up. Or had her fiance buy to fix up, but likes to tell people she's going to be the one fixing it up. Somehow I can't see this coming from the girl who does her nails on a daily basis at work, but whatever. Work is better now, but I think she knows I do it cause of her so she now does less work. I may be busier BUT I do have the banging beats of Paul Oakenfold in my ears so I'm happy! YAY me. Not to mention I have a cute as hell boyfriend who reminds me a million times a day what a wonderful person I am and what a tool she is. So I'm loved, she's psychotic so NAH!  Anyway, not much is going on. I moved so my commute for the next few months is mini torture, but I'll live and soon enough I'll be living with the love of my life and Holly so it's just a matter of sacrifice now. So....anyone know a good townhome for rent for a good price in the vicinity of Glenview/Deerfield....keep your eyes peeled I have till October!!   urlLink http://timberkivi.blogspot.com  turns 21 next weekend. We are taking the fat kid out to Gameworks for drunken video game fun. I think it'll be a blast considering I'm dating a big kid, and I couldn't see the Kivster in a banging night club his first weekend at an official grown up. Now Kivi, this does mean your mom can not call and ask the 'Fruity Pebbles' question anymore!!! Alrighty then...I'm outie, I actually am busy. Just a breather. AHHHH......there I feel better.   Love you honey.  ....they just strut...what the F*@& (edited for under 21 audiences)

      ...don't waste your time on me your already the voice inside my head....  My blog bores people I think, then again I didn't make to to entertain I made it to vent fustrations, so who the funk cares. :)  I have a million and one things I SHOULD be doing (not work wise, it's pretty slow this morning otherwise I wouldn't be typing this) but can't seem to motivate myself to do anything. I'm chalking it up to my accident and all the meds I've been on.   ****I fell at work, sprained my lower back for those of you who don't know*****  So I'll make a list:    Things I should be doing, but just don't have the motivation to do    1. Picking up hours at the Bennigan's trying to catch up from this time I've been on workmen's comp.  2. Calling the damn Walgreens to see if I can get a receipt for my Vicodan that Dayne accidently threw away, but I need to turn into workmen comp.  3. Finding out where the hell my boyfriend is since he's not answering his phone when I call.   3 1/2. Kicking his butt if he rode his bike to work since it's supposed to thunderstorm today.  4. July's financial forecast (i.e. figuring out how I'm going to get those damned bills paid.)  5. Working to get rid of this extra 40 pounds! Damn the slowing of the metabolism.  6. Finding an apartment since I only have till October 1st to find a place to live.  7. Stop stressing over all the money I spent in the last month.  8. Find a birthday gift for my guy.   O.K. I have a month for that    9. Getting sunglasses before I go blind from squinting.  10. Watching the reply of I love the 90's on VH1 for the laugh.  11. Figuring out how loud I can turn up my headphones and still hear the phone ring since Kelly's getting louder and louder.  12. Beating the crap out of the mofo's that decided to leave us with a $217 bill on Saturday.  13. Finding cheap ways Dayne and I can spend time together.   14. Finding cheap (but nice) hotels we can stay in when we need to have some private time so we don't have an experience like we did last weekend.   FYI...never stay at the DAYS INN in Kenosha    15. Getting the song 'Funky Town' town out my head. Don't ask I don't know.  16. Organizing my desk.  17. Cleaning my car, inside and out. Mainly to get that smiley face off the back of my car and my boyfriend off my back about how messy my car is.  18. Figuring out why I find this (  urlLink Mental Drippings  ) so damn funny.  19. Learning how to drive stick.  20. Getting a haircut.  21. Finding a stylist closer to home that I like so I can get a hair cut.  22. One word ladies .... Pedicure... It's open toe shoe season and I'm without one (shutter)  23. Finding new ways to please my man (and I don't mean in the bedroom)  24. Finding new ways to please my man (and this time I do mean in the bedroom)  25. Realize my addiction to reading other peoples blogs and coming to terms with it. (I need a self help group, do you think there's  BA .  26. Finding out why the whole ....they make you run faschter... thing is just so funny to me.  27. E mailing back my best friend over in Iraq.  28. Figuring out where to take my honey for his birthday.   Ok, I know I have a month    29. Getting back to work instead of typing here.......  30. Developing the pictures I took on the Fat Kid's 21st  31. Finding new music to listen to.  32. Realizing how old I'm getting because they made an I love the 90's and I can't believe the whole Amy Fisher thing and Ren and Stimpy first came out 12 years ago.  33. Calling Beth to let her know I have Friday and Sunday off.  34. Going to the bathroom instead of holding it.  35. Laughing out loud on how much money Brittany Spears is going to loose out on her 2nd marriage now (dumbass that doesn’t want a pre-nup!)  36. Buying shorts to wear since it’s damn hot.  37. Drinking my Venti Iced Double Shot White Mocha with whip cream…..maybe if I did I’d be motivated!  38. Asking for my vacation days. (Dear GOD! I need them!)  39. Finding a hobby before I go crazy….   40. Actually getting back to work instead of typing more.     ***Update, 3 and 3 1/2 are done, found him, no bike, he just slept in***

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Irish Pub Closes Over Smoking Ban   I tell you what this 'smoking ban' thing is the STUPIDEST law ever. I can deal with the separate rooms from smokers, or even some restaurant right to ban smoking, because it's an open area. I respect the fact you don't want me to smoke near your kids or in your house, but IT'S A FRIGGIN BAR! I even know ALOT of NON-smokers who smoke when they drink....get off your "I'm gonna die from your smoke" horse, suck it up and deal with it. One night isn't going to kill you TRUST ME. Or better yet stop hangin at bars and you'll be fine. But the first time you get a beer bottle to the face cause you wanted to stop a nic fitting, beer filled smoker from lighting up....don't come whining to me!...Cripes it may have been me.....you big baby.

       urlLink U N A W A R E   Who's jealous I'm going to his movie premiere! I know you are! Ok, most of the people who read this blog are coming too...but hell. It sounds really cool to say I'm going to a movie premiere!   Good luck to Holly who may perform topless in a thong in the movie, but would never lie and say she was moving in with a friend in Vegas, but really moving in with a skanky stripper.   Oh and if anyone who's reading this WANTS to come and isn't already Holly would really love the support! It's at the Performing Arts Theatre in Skokie right across from Old Orchard (where the Doubletree Hotel is). It's $5....there's a showing at 6 and 8. Most of us are probably going to the 8 showing to go out afterward. Come join the fun.....

      .....yeah-a, alright we'll spend the night together, wake up and live forever.  Damn! I haven't updated in a while! I think it's because I'm so busy at work I almost forgot I had a blog.....how can one forget! It's like I turned into Kivi for a moment!  Well, Gary was nice enough to comment in my blog that it popped into my email and I remembered, damnit girl you need to blog. You set it up to relieve stress.....do it damn it!  In answer to your question Gary...I'm not sure what kind of hobby I'm looking for. You see the man in my life goes to the track on Saturdays to ride his dirtbike. (While I'm serving tables for 10 hours....Nice) It's something he REALLY enjoys and it relieves a lot of stress for him. It got me to thinking that I really need something to relieve the stress in my life.  Right now, riding the El for hour would be a little difficult since I have only one day a week to myself ... and to myself I mean I don't have to go to work. Lately Dayne and I have been spending a lot of time going to a local park finding a quiet spot to lay out a blanket and spend the day reading, drinking beer, and being alone with each other..... and it's wonderful. But those moments are few and far between.  I could tell you my hobby is playing and electronic handheld solitaire game at night when I get home, but that could make me a loser. (take my advice people DON'T pick up one of these games! They are highly addicting, it may be harder to give up the solitaire than it was to give up the coke problem I had.) I could tell you my hobby is drinking beer, but that would make me an alcoholic. I could tell you my hobby is being intimate with my boyfriend, but that's more of a necessity than a hobby.  I don't have a knack for drawing or painting (although I love art....) I don't have a knack for writing (although I blog) I don't have a death wish so riding is out of the question (besides the boys might have a heart attack if I showed up with them) I just need something to take my mind off the day.  Dayne can tell you for this, I stress about EVERYTHING. I'm stress about his get together for his birthday, I'm stressed about work, I'm stress about finances, I'm stress about a place to live, I'm stressed about having to make it through today, I'm stressed about going to the white trash fair with my family this weekend (that's the Wisconsin State Fair for you non-locals) I'm pretty much on edge ALL the time. That's why Dayne and I make a great couple. He NEVER stresses unless it's about work, and about twenty minutes after he's left here.....it's gone. I want that power. Maybe I can make my hobby the ability not to have to plan EVERYTHING to a tee. But I doubt that will happen.  Ok, I have to start work now......I'll come back later when it quiets down and write some more since I haven't written in awhile.  Hasta.
