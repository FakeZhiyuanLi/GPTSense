      I am going to make an effort to be brutally honest on this thing. I figure, why have a record of what's going on in my life, if it isn't really what's going on in my life? There are things about ourselves that we don't always want people to know - especially the people we're closest to. The ones we're afraid of dissapointing (Hi, Mom and Dad) But I don't want to fudge the truth anymore because I'm worried about what someone will think of me. Everyone has faults. Everyone makes mistakes. And I hope that the people I love will still love me, even if they know all about the stupid or thoughtless or shallow things I sometimes do.  So, I've been having a few interpersonal problems at work. Its a long and boring story I may write later. I'm not the most well socialized person, I don't deal well with confrontation or difficult situations, I don't know what say to people a lot of the time. Sometimes I'm too sensitive, and I'm always way too insecure. I know I'm an emotional coward and my preferred method of dealing with personal problems is to ignore them in the hopes they'll dissapear.    PC BAHNGS   The PC bahng I frequent now has a non-smoking section, with nice little sign hanging above it. Before, you were free to light up wherever - the owner would bring you an ashtray (a paper cup with a bit of water in it). Now, however, the government says they've gotta be 50 percent smoke free. So we've got a smoking section for one aisle of computers, and a nonsmoking section in the other aisle.  For those of you not in Korea, a PC bahng is an internet cafe. Some are pretty nice inside, others are a little dingy. All of them are pretty cheap. The general price here in Jecheon is 1000 won/hour. And you can smoke, eat and drink in them. Which was a nice change when I got here, after having been subject to the U of C info commons' absolutely no food or drinks at the computer stations policy. Most of the people who come here either play games, or chat online. Or look at porn - anyways, whoever was at this station before me was - I went to type in an address and the address bar showed someone had visited lesbian free pics or something.  Generally, I love PC bahngs. They're cheap, open 24 hours a day, have fast internet access, there are tons of them wherever you go, and you can eat and drink in them. Lately, though, I'm not liking them so much. It could be because its the rainy season, and half the time I go, I get drenched on the way home because I didn't bring a jacket or umbrella. Or maybe it could be the way three little kids will sneak up behind you and stare at you and whatever you're doing. And then giggle and run away - or giggle and not run away. Or the constant barrage of twenty people playing games and music with the sound cranked up. Its probably all these things. And the keyboard condoms.  I was planning on waiting until I got home to buy a laptop, but I think that I may see if I can get one in Seoul this week. I'm a little scared though - I know fuck-all about computers. Except - windows is evil, and Bill Gates is the antichrist. At least, that was what I learned in the few CPSC 231 lectures I was awake for.   MY DAD   My Dad is riding his bike across Canada. I think its fucking fabulous. It's a supported trip - Mom is driving a trailer so he doesn't have to haul all his gear. He started in Prince Rupert I think, and is somewhere in BC or Alberta right now. They sent me some pictures that I'll post if I ever figure how to do anything on this other than type. I showed them to some friends I was out with. One said he would love to meet my Dad - that he sounded like a really cool guy and looked very Zen. Of course, a Korean friend also said that she would love to meet him so she could take a picture with him and tell everyone she met Santa (his hair is white and he has a beard). I love you Dad - you rock!

      Okay, so this is my first attempt at creating a blog, and it may crash and burn miserably. Anyone out there who might read this - please be kind. We are all beginners at some point.  Today is the first day of the my eight days of vacation. I'm heading off to Seoul tomorrow with A and YJ. The intention is to see some interesting stuff (museums, palaces, whatever) but I have a feeling its going to turn into one long night of partying punctuated by a few shopping expeditions. We're going to hook up with some of her friends and stay with them. I feel a bit awkward crashing at a strangers house...but not awkward enough to pay for a yogwan if I don't have to.

      So...I'm home. Ahhsssah! I left Korea at 6:30pm on aug 23, and I got to Calgary at...6:30 pm aug 23. The flight I came on was originally scheduled to leave at 4:40. When I called to confirm my flight, they said it had been changed to 5, and when I checked in at the airport, they said 6:10, but we didn't get off the ground for another twenty minutes.  The flight itself was fine. When we landed in Vancouver it was around 1 in the afternoon. Great, I though, I have plenty of time to relax before I catch my flight to Calgary at 4. But. We sat on the tarmac waiting to be "de-planed" for fifteen minutes. Why couldn't we get off? Because they needed to have someone check these SARS forms we all had to fill out. Which basically consisted of 4 questions that you circled "no" for. High tech medical screening this was not.  Then I went through customs, which was a mercifully short line. Thank God I had a connecting flight, because the people that were staying in Vancouver got a line that was probably a couple hundred people long. Our plane had landed at the same time as a plane from China.  By the time I got to the baggage claim, and bags started coming out, it was nearly 2. And I stood there waiting.  And waiting, and waiting. Until it was just after 3. As time past, and it became clearer that I would have to leave without my luggage, I just wanted to sit down there in the middle of the floor and cry. I was tired, and sick, and I doubted that I would ever get my suitcase. I filled out a lost baggage claim form and left to catch my plane to Calgary.  This makes two international flights into Canada in the past two years, both on Air Canada, both of which lost my bags. This never seems to happen when I leave the country. Or when I fly West jet within Canada. I'm so fucking pissed off. Not just because they lost my bag (why mine?) but because I was so goddamn early for everything. I booked the ticket months ago. I wasn't even the tenth person to check in with my luggage. Two hundred other people on the plane, most of them with two or three huge, overweight bags, most of whom checked in after me. But they had to go and lose the only bag I checked. I'm never flying Air Canada again if I can avoid it.   Air Canada Sucks.  On a happy note, they finally found my bag, and its going to be here Tuesday afternoon. Took them long enough.

      When I was a kid, I lived in a couple small towns in Northern Alberta. I lived in Swan Hills for 3 years. Swan Hills is primarily known for its proximity to the only toxic waste dump in Canada. I lived in Whitecourt for the next five years. Whitecourt is known for...well, not much. But I remember that there was a sign on the highway going into town that proclaimed it "The Snowmobile Capital of Alberta."  Neither of these towns had much going on in it. I mean, kids in Swan Hills had to be bussed out of town to go to high school, and Whitecourt didn't even have a movie theatre until 1988. And not that McDonald's is any barometer of a place, but they didn't get a McDonald's in Whitecourt until the 90's. I think Swan Hills is still a McDonalds free zone.  I remember after I moved to Calgary, I heard my mother and her friend who still lived in Whitecourt chatting about how much trouble teenagers get into in small towns. What can you do, except drive too fast, go camping, drink, have sex and do drugs? Go dirt biking in the summer and snowmobiling in the winter. Play hockey.  So I thought to myself, "Hey, I bet there have to be a few people out there that live in these places that have blogs." Lots of free time and not a hell of a lot of outlets for it = many hours on the internet, right? Thats my experience here, anyways. Not so. I did a search and came up with people who passed through these towns on trips and - Rea!  I wonder what these places are like now. I haven't been in either (other than to drive through it) in a decade. The people I used to know, places I used to go - are they the same, are they different? Did they get better or worse? Does anyone else ever wonder about this? Maybe its because I'm living in Korea, and I'm far from the familiar that I want to revisit it.  I did a search on a girl that I was best friends with for years, and I actually found her. Living in Toronto, doing something I never would have expected her to be doing. I don't think I ever really thought I would find her. Because now I'm thinking, well, should I contact her? What would I say - hey, I'm living in Korea and I saw you on the net, well I did a search specificly for you on google and... I feel like a voyeur. Or a stalker.  But if anyone does know of a blog written by a person from Swan Hills or Whitecourt, could ya let me know?

      The director's wife came into the teachers' room today and (through one of the Korean teachers) asked me how a student was doing. Which wouldn't be tough to answer if I only had a few classes of kids and I saw each class every day, or even every other day. But.  I teach 7 40 minute classes a day, five days a week, so 35 classes a week total. Some classes I see three times a week or once a week, but most I see twice a week. The classes are never bigger than ten students, but I still need to remember over a hundered names. And unfortunately, they all seem to have really similar names. Many students in different classes have the same name (I've got at least six Sallys) and there's a general trend in a lot of classes towards students with close names. One class I taught had a Jim, Joey, Jack, James and Jenny in it. Another I teach has a Sally, Susie, Cindy, Sandy, and Susan. It took me a month before I could keep who was who straight. And when I see so many children all the time, I don't remember a hell of a lot about each of them.  So, asking me how Sally is doing is a difficult question to answer. Even if I know exactly which student in which class she's asking about, I need to stop and think for a good five minutes. But, given enough time, I could probably put a name, face and at least a few general comments to every student, which I am pretty proud of.  The director's wife asked, "How's Jerry doing? How's his pronunciation, his speaking skills, his behavior."  This particular student was, when he joined the class, the oldest student in it, and the one who knew the most. Since then though, there's been some attrition, and new students have joined the class. He's no longer the smartest, or the oldest. And he can get a little uncontrolable at times. Not that I blame him for it - these kids get shunted off to hagwons sometime starting at 4 years old and spend 80% of their childhood being taught at. But he's still hyper and disruptive sometimes, and the director's wife thinks children should sit properly or stand still in perfectly straight lines at all times. So what do you say?  I said, "He's doing well, but he could be doing better, his pronunciation is pretty good but still needs some work, his behavior is generally good but some days he doesn't listen to me, and overall I think he is keeping up with the class and is one of the better students."  Which is what I might say about 75% of the students. Oh well. I never claimed to be a  good  teacher.

      Lately (okay, for about 5 months) I've been thinking a lot about privacy. We all have different places we draw the privacy line, things we consider private that other people don't.   So, I've removed all the names from my blog, seeing as I didn't ask anyone permission to post anything about them. Though it is all completely truthful, so at least I couldn't be sued for libel if it came down to it.  Anyone who happens to live in Jecheon and winds up on this site will probably have a good idea of who I am. That's okay, it's my choice to spew my personal life out here for public consumption. Not that much of the public is reading it. But no one else made the choice to have anything about them written on here, so I will make an effort not to infringe too much on their privacy. I won't post names.  But back to thoughts on privacy.  Where I consitently draw lines, where I say -  this thing is private  - these are things that I'm kind of embarrassed or ashamed of. It isn't quite that simplistic, but...  For example. I read romance novels. And I hate hate hate hate sharing that little detail about myself. I don't mind having people know I read science fiction, or fantasy, or erotica, or even man action adverture novels a la Clive Cussler. I'll stick those on my bookshelf next to my copies of Jane Eyre and Kafka's collected works. I'll read them on the bus. But the romance novels, those get shunted to the bottom bottom shelf where it is difficult to see there are even books there, much less what kind of books they are. They embarrass me therefore they are private.  I consider my room private, but only when it is dirty. If it's clean, I don't care who sees it. When its dirty, its private. My body is private. And I harbor some serious feelings of loathing about my body. Sex is private. Dancing is private - not the shitty nightclub dancing that I can't really do, but completely wild unfettered crazy dancing - curtains closed, lights up and music blasting. Clothing optional. Which is another reason why its private. Going to the bathroom is private. My deepest inner feelings, about myself, my past and present, my failures and flaws and mistakes. These are all things that are private.  What things do most people consider private? Sex. Bodily functions. Bodies. All generally kept confined, in rooms, hidden in clothes. How many people feel comfortable even talking about their last bowel movement, let alone doing it in front of someone? We all do it. And our heads, our inner life and thoughts are intensely private. It's a lot easier to laugh off someone walking in on you while you're sitting on the toilet, than it is when someone reads your diary.   People are more and more worried about the invasion of their privacy. Governments and companies keeping track of websites you visit so they can see if you're dangerous, or a good target for their next mass mailing campaign. Things you buy on your visa. What you used your airmiles card for. Where you went to school. What your grades were. Who you've slept with. I couldn't care less if I wound up on every corporate mailing list on the planet and the government had a file three feet thick on me. I'm neither that interesting or important. Most of us aren't. Go ahead and invade my privacy all you want. But remember... turnabout is fair play.

      2 more weeks...2 more weeks...2 more weeks...  My refridgerator is malfunctioning again. Fuuuuuck. It's a good thing I use it more as a cupboard than a fridge. Due to my extreme cockroach paranoia, I don't keep any food anywhere except in the fridge. And since I'm lazy, I don't keep much food I have to cook around - I'd rather go out to eat. But the freezer part works, so at least my ice cream won't melt.  I've been thinking about buying a computer. Well, I've been thinking about buying a computer for the past two years but I never had any money. Now that I have the money to buy one, I'm coming face to interface with the depth of my ignorance about computers. Its truly depressing how little I know about computers. Really, really, depressing.   Where, oh where could I possibly find a source of information that would tell me everything I need to know about computers? Hmmm...let me think...

      I went out last night with friends for dinner after work. We had spicy chicken. Mmmmm...yum. Afterwards, we went out to a bar for a few drinks. The place is called "Hite Class" or some stupid thing, but almost everyone refers to it as 'the patio place' because its about the only place in Jecheon that has a real one, not just a few plastic chairs and a table sitting on the sidewalk in front of the building. Its on the second floor, too, so you get a good view of the street...not that there's much to view. Except maybe the twenty-somethings stumbling home...before midnight...because they still live with their parents and have to be home before they turn into soju-filled pumpkins.  At the patio place, we ran into a couple teachers, one from Ireland and one from New Zealand hanging out with some Korean students/friends. The two guys were participating in that favorite male bonding ritual that involves ingesting copious amounts of various fermented beverages containing ethanol. We decided to join them. Fun was had, more drinks were drunk. Though not that many, as we left around 1am. And I, of course, being the pillar of moderation and self-control that I am, did not get drunk. Though given an extra hour or two and I'm sure I would have.  After we left the bar, people started splitting off in various directions to head home. So there's these two drunk foreigners, myself - not drunk at all, two Korean girls and one Korean guy left standing on the street, debating whether to go elsewhere or head home. We're on the verge of splitting, then one guy says something to the other. I don't know what, although I'm pretty sure it was something defaming Irish rugby players. And they start arguing the way only irrational drunken men can argue when trying to prove who the alpha male is. So I decided to leave because I hate confrontation. And I assumed that it wouldn't actually become physical. I crossed the street, hailed a cab, got in, and just as the cab was pulling away, I looked out the window and saw the Korean guy standing between them, physically restraining one guy from going after the other. Jeez.   So last night, I was worried about whether or not it was resolved without violence. And I felt bad because I left the Koreans to deal with the drunk and possibly dangerous foreigners. Way to ruin a buzz. Thanks a lot, guys.  At least my TV is functioning again. Watching CNN is always good for adjusting your perspective on life.

      And I think you all agree with me on that. I've been getting GST checks even though I'm not eligible for them anymore. I figured as much, and I've not been depositing them. When I filed my income tax last year, I even wrote on the one I had and sent it with my return. So now they've sent me some mail saying that I owe them over $100. WTF? Don't they have numbers on the checks and some fancy schmancy tracking stuff so they can  see  that I haven't cashed them, and then just stop payment on them. Give me a break.  That's what recruiters should put out to advertise jobs here: Come to Korea! Escape Student Loans, Revenue Canada, and your parents' house.

      that the chili pepper wasn't introduced to Korea until the 15th century? I wonder what Koreans ate instead of kimchi in 1399? Lots of fermented non spicy kimchi? Hmm... it probably tasted a lot like sauerkraut.

      Anyone who has been to a country where English is not a native language has probably experienced the weird phenomena of hybridized English. Here in the Land of the Morning Calm, its called Konglish. There's a certain cachet to having English on your products, on your advertizing, on your t-shirts, regardless of whether or not anyone can actually read it, let alone understand it. This one is off of a school notebook called Blue Angel.   Merry merry angel! Under leaues so green, A happy flossom sees you suight as arrow, Seek your eardle uarrow near my flossom.  My current notebook is called Nature:  Be chic about a notebook. Tasty character is our basic criterion.  Mmmm... a notebook with tasty character. Yum.

      Trying to learn how to use html and css for the first time is a real pain in the ass when you don't have your own computer. So if this looks shitty right now - be warned, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Until last week I didn't even know what html and css stood for.   17 more days til I'm home. Yay!! I can't wait to see everyone. I've already started thinking about what I have to bring with me. Actually, and I know this will sound kinda anal-rententive, but I've already started putting things in my suitcase. I am so excited.  The colors on this monitor are doing a weird shifting thing.

      Today is my last day of vacation. I go back to school tomorrow. Dammit. In case anyone is interested in what I'm reading right now: The Red Queen: sex and the evolution of human nature - so far really fascinating; No Logo - I can't belive I didn't read this book before now; Harry Potter; Funeral in Blue (mystery); The Devil You Know (romance); Native Speaker (by a Korean American author). I'm not completely thrilled with Harry Potter - I think it's the most disapointing read - but that's maybe only because its the one I was expecting the most of.   Itaewon  Itaewon is an interesting place. There's about every single culture you can imagine there. And most of these people are living in Korea, not here as tourists. Lots of American Gi's hang out there, and if you're out around eleven, you can see the MP's rounding up the wayward soldiers before curfew. It's a great place to find western clothing, and soveniers, and western food. If you want something, and you can't find it anywhere else, you can probably find it there, though maybe not right out on the main street. And it is the first place I have been in Korea that makes me feel nervous.  Itaewon has a bit of a bad reputation, so maybe that's all it was. But I really think there's a kind of scary vibe to the place - it is not somewhere I would want to walk around by myself after dark. Of course, I would say that about lots of streets in downtown Calgary. There's plenty of scary in walking down McLeod Trail northbound under the railroad overpass between 9th and 10th ave S and crossing paths with a couple big drunk rough looking guys walking in the opposite direction. At night. When there's inexplicably no traffic on that stretch of road.

      So the expedition to Seoul was interesting. It turned out to be primarily a shopping trip - but what a trip. The weather was hot and humid, so we ended up trying to stick to shopping indoors in places with air-conditioning. Went out a few times and met some interesting people, some really nice people and some not so nice people. The main areas we ended up in were, predictably, Itaewon, Insadong and Dongdaemun. Why predictable? Well, Itaewon is an artsy, antiquey district (think Kensington). Dongdaemun is a huge shopping district filled with countless department stores and street vendors. And Itaewon is where the foreigners hang out. So, all great places to spend lots of money.  Monday We left Jecheon at about 3:30, expecting to get to where we were going in Seoul around 6. But because of traffic jams, we didn't make it until maybe 9. Usually it takes just under two hours to get to Seoul. I thought, maybe it would be a little longer, given that its the holidays, but 3 extra hours? By the time we got into town, and had dinner (with my friend's uncle and his wife), we just wanted to find a place to sleep. We ended up crashing at a Yogwan in Sinchon.  Tuesday We got up early and headed off to YoungPoong Bookstore - Yay! English books! I spent more than I should have, but I couldn't help myself. I bought Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. After lunch, we went over to Hongak where YJ was recording a Chinese CD - I think he's using it to teach Chinese on the internet, but I'm not quite clear. Then went over to Itaewon to do some shopping.  That night, we met up with one of A's former coworkers, hmmm...lets call him J. Interesting guy, J. He showed up with a Korean girlfriend, but when everyone but he and I went off to Dongdaemun for a couple hours to find some clothes for tomorrow, he started getting a little bit too close for comfort. Now I didn't go because I was too tired and lazy to go anywhere. And I felt perfectly comfortable hanging out with an almost total stranger because my friends knew him.  When we were playing pool and I really felt like I was being staked out as his territory - way too much casual contact, invasion of my personal space bubble, etc. But maybe I can write it all off to cultural differences. Regardless, I had a great time, met some interesting foreigners in the bar - Nashville. There were a fair number of English teachers there from the usual places, but a few 'real' expats too. I met one guy from Lybia and one from Egypt, though when I asked them what they were doing in Korea they both responded, "working". Jeez, I was just trying to start a conversation. I definately provided some entertainment for everyone there - my pool playing was almost too bad to be real. Except for some strange reason when I managed to beat the one guy who had beat just about everyone else there. Which just goes to show you - skill is better than luck, but luck is better than nothing.  We went off to a dance club "Kings Club" for about an hour. It wasn't very full (well, it was a Tuesday night). The clientele was split between hiphop loving, Fubu wearing foreigners (mostly blacks, but a few white faces), and Koreans. It also came complete with a few dancing girls - beautiful Russians standing on platfoms, wearing skimpy lingerie, and dancing with a look that you knew meant they had just downed something illegal.  Wendnesday We spent the morning in Itaewon, shopping around, but I didn't buy too much. Then off to Dongdaemun, again, looking lots but not buying. Then headed off to Insadong to meet a few of YJ's friends for dinner. Most of them didn't speak English, so I was content to just sit in the background and take it easy. A couple of them made an effort to talk to me a bit, but the conversations were pretty limited.  I've been in Korea long enough that I don't mind this so much anymore. Usually people make an attempt to include you when they can. What I did mind was when two more of his friends showed up, who were English majors in university, and actually spoke less than the others. One guy didn't say one word to me, barely glanced in my direction. Pissed me right off. Not only was it rude, but it seemed stupid. Here is a real live English speaker for you to talk to - if you were interested enough to take the damn subject as your major, shouldn't you be at least a little bit curious?  Then they decided to go drinking in Itaewon, because thats where we were staying for the night. So off to Itaewon, only once we get there, no one can decide where to go. They stand on the corner, chatting for about five minutes, waiting for someone to make a decision. Finally, they walk into one place and then walk out. Why? Because there are too many foreigners. WTF? It's Itaewon - of course there's lots of foreigners. I will admit that I really have no idea how Korean culture works, but trying to make a decision on the spot with a group of Koreans - these Koreans anyway - it was a fucking pain. They keep talking and talking - I don't know what they're saying because its all in Korean. And no one makes any decisions. I ended up dragging them off to Nashville where we had been the night before, because, at least you can play darts and pool there, and you don't need to speak much to have fun.  Thursday A and YJ were going home in the morning, so I left what I had in their car, and went off by myself for the day. After futilely looking and looking and wondering what I should buy, and who would like what, I just gave up and started buying things I liked, or thought were cute, or knew someone would like without worrying about who I was buying it for. Cause otherwise I never would have bought anything. So, I spent an hour in Itaewon, then went to the Kyobo bookstore and again spent way too much money on books, then to Insadong for about four hours. I thing I must have been into every single shop on that street.  I don't know if I got the best deal on everything, but I'm pretty pleased that a vase I picked up in Itaewon for around 20,000 I saw in Insadong tagged at 40,000. Buy the time I was finished, I know I spent too much money, I had a huge amount of stuff to lug home, my feet were sore, I was hot, sweaty and tired, and I couldn't wait to get home.  I took the bus home on Thursday evening - I was pretty much exhausted - and by the time I got home I barely had the energy to set my bags down before I collapsed. Since then, I've basically been on a huge binge - a reading binge. My TV hasn't been on since last weekend. I didn't really remember how much I like reading until I spent all of Friday and almost all of today with my nose stuck in a book. God, it was nice. And I have lots more to say about Seoul, but I'm in the middle of reading a book and I want to go home and finish it.

      Canada ain't so cool a place as I might wish it were.  Why?  Seems that a couple countries are making it tough for the UN to draft the Decleration of the Rights of Indiginous peoples. Canada and Australia don't want to cede quite so much as people seem to think they should. Go check it out at  urlLink oneworld news .   And I found out something else I didn't know  urlLink here .Now that Vancouver has won the bid for the 2010 Olympics, looks like BC is going to be building all over some nice pristince wilderness that belongs to some indiginous peoples. And these indiginous peoples happened to vote 85% against the proposed developement three years ago.  Way to go. Like governments haven't stomped all over their rights enough in the past. Let's go do it some more.  This is why I don't know anything about politics. It always depresses me. Thank you, Naomi Klein, for ruining my blissful ignorance.

      I am currently re-reading Naomi Klein's utterly fascinating book   No Logo . If you've read this book, I know you share my enthusiasm, and possibly my shame for shopping at Gap so often. (Hey - their pants always fit me, what else can I say?) If you have not read this book yet...what the hell have you been doing for the past four years? Go check out her website  urlLink here .  What is this book about? Lots of stuff. It's about brands and logos, sweatshops and multinational corporations, advertising and ad-busting. If you in any way oppose, or just wonder if you should oppose, globalization and the incredible control multinationals have over life, if you're looking for a job and wonder why there are so many part time and temp positions and so few permanent full time positions, if you've ever wondered why you get to pay over $100 for shoes that cost less than $10 to make, or why a CEO can make $130 million in bonuses the same year the company tells you they can't afford to give you a raise, you should read this book.  If you already know all the stuff in this book, and have no need to read it - well, I'm fucking impressed. If you don't know it, and haven't read it yet, I sure as hell hope you do before you go out there protesting anymore G8 summits or WTO conferences. Because the intelligent replies to why we should protest are right there.  Naomi Klein's new book is called   Fences and Windows: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Globalization Debate .  I had no idea that she had put out a new book, but I can't wait to read it.

      Let me start out by saying that the reason I never blog about political things is because I know nothing about them. But, since I'm kinda on the subject, I feel like I should come out of the closet and state that I fully support legalizing same sex marriage.   (horrible pun I know but I couldn't resist)    People keep arguing over the definition of the word marriage. Well, in linguistics they teach you that language is a fluid thing, that it's always changing, and words are constantly being redefined.  No one ever talks about marriage anymore as being something strictly for the purposes of procreation. Or even probably. It isn't intended to unite families, or dynasties, or to consolidate assests. And these are all things it has been used for in the past. It's all about love. Today, ideally, you don't marry someone unless you're in love with them.  Can we justifiably exclude people from getting married, just because the word used to mean something else? Get real. That isn't what it means anymore. The only reason to prevent same sex couples from getting married is sheer stupid fear. Do people think that their own marriage will be polluted somehow just by virtue of being associated under the same word? Are they worried their kids will decide they'd much rather be gay than straight because when they get married they won't have to worry about leaving the toilet seat up (or down)? What's the worst that could happen - you might be forced to go to their wedding?  I think that any marriage between consenting adults should be legal. Including unions of more than two people. And - before anyone starts throwing out fucked up senarios whereby my definition of marriage would result in unions consiting of two women, a boy and a dog - remember I said   consenting adults .  Who else would have tried doing this except Jean Cretien? Definately not the Canadian 'traditional family values' Alliance. Or the Bloc Quebecois, who would be too wrapped up in seperatist issues to care. Who could have done this? Not the NDP or PCs - if they still exist.  So. Thanks, JC, for trying to do something that is long overdue. Let's all hope Paul Martin, Ralph Klein or someone else won't go and fuck it up.

      Or so says the Economist. And they ain't talking about the weather. Apparently, the more liberal direction in social matters (legalizing same-sex marriage, decriminalizing pot, becoming more ethnically diverse and open to immigrants) is improving our image. We aren't all just lumberjacks and fur trappers. Some of us are gay, pot-smoking lumberjacks from Uzbekistan.

      In February I went to a few Korean lessons. The first night I was there, some guy was taking pictures for a paper or something. I didn't think they would end up anywhere that people would actually see them.  Last weekend I was walking down the street with a friend and ran into the guy who sort of runs the lessons. He dragged us into this store, pulled out some local magazine, opened it up, and there were those pictures. In class on Thursday, one of my students pulled out the same magazine to show me. And someone told me that there was one up at the train station somewhere.   Why the hell does anyone care? I'm not important, I'm not very interesting, not in Canada or Korea. Sometimes the reactions Koreans have to foreigners here seem so out of whack with reality. Kids walking down the street yell "Wayguk saram" (foreign person) or "Miguk saram" (American) the way kids at home might say "Hey, that's Jennifer Lopez." Or maybe more like "Hey look at Bozo the clown". It's equal parts flattering and annoying. I like anonymity...especialy when I'm stumbling home Saturday morning past the kids on their way to school.  In a town like Jecheon, where there's maybe three dozen foreigners, there's a kind of celebrity attatched. You always stick out. People notice you. but they don't always really notice you - I've been mistaken for  people I don't look like at all, other than being white and having dark hair. Of course, maybe we just all look the same?  Something else Koreans seems to enjoy - telling you what famous person you look like. Every once in a while there's an actual resemblance, but usually there isn't. And sometimes it can be a less than flattering comparison. Last night, a man in the bar we were in was telling a few of us who we looked like. There was Sharon Stone, Britney Spears, and Dustin Hoffman. And who was I? I got to be Grace Kelly. Just call me "Her Serene Highness."  Who do you get compared to?

      So this same night at Seven, I had an interesting discussion with a Korean man who works as a bodyguard. He spoke a bit about North Korea, which I don't really hear much about from most Koreans. He told me that most Koreans underestimate Kim Jong Il and North Korea. The owner, he said, all he cares about is women. He - most Korean people - they don't think about serious things. They don't realize how important it is to have the American army in South Korea. Kim Jong Il, he told me, is a very dangerous man, as dangerous as Saddam Hussein and Bin Laden. Korea is a very dangerous place, he said. Things could become bad very fast, and I should go back to Canada quickly.  This is the first time I've ever heard anything seriously negative from a Korean about the North, and the first time a Korean told me they really supported the presence of American soldiers.  Something for me to think about.

      I'm a little pissed today. And not in a good way.  Yesterday night, I went out for a coffee with a friend. We wound up at a bar called "Seven" because I wanted to play pool and they have a free table there. There were already a number of the other local expats in the place, so we ended up staying. After we had been there for a couple drinks, a Korean man (the owner) decided that he "liked me." So I spent most of the rest of the evening trying to evade him without being rude about it.  I didn't want to be rude and say "Fuck off, I'm not interested in you and you're being really annoying." Which is what I would have done in Canada. Because it is his bar, and I didn't want to create a situation where I wouldn't feel like I could come back there, or piss him off in just the wrong way to make it a foreigner-unfriendly zone.  He was totally invading my space and kept on brushing my head like I was some kind of cute pet dog - maybe bitch would be a more accurate word. A couple of times during the evening he grabbed my arm - really grabbed it, I've got bruises - and physically dragged me over to where he decided I should be. Every time he decided he needed to say something to me, he dragged a Korean over who new English to translate. At one point he decided we should dance, and had his arms wrapped around my neck so I was practically choking.  So, who am I pissed at, specifically? Well, this Korean guy for one. What, he figures that all white western women are easy and if he tells me I'm beautiful I'll fall into bed with him? That he has the lisence to do whatever he wants because he's drunk and a man and owns the place? The guy asked for my phone number, and I gave it to him, but what the fuck can he say to me anyways, since he barely speaks any English and my Korean is nonexistent.   And, I'm pissed a little at the other westerners there, who might have interceded, who may have had more experience with coping with situations like this, who might have known how to get rid him for me, but didn't do anything until it didn't matter. (Although thank you to those who occupied the seat next to me.) Who just stared at me when I was nearly choking in his vice like grip and went on with their game of pool. But I'm not really pissed at them, because it wasn't their responsibility to do anything.  Mostly I'm pissed at myself. That I didn't handle it better, that I was trying to be polite at the expense of my personal comfort and dignity and possibly safety. That I tried to laugh it off and turn it into a joke, when I really felt like it wasn't. I'm such a fucking wimp.

      I've resisted taking an IQ test for years. I know I took one once when I was very young, but my mother always refused to tell me the score. So I was never sure if I was either exceptionally smart, and she didn't want it to go to my head, or not so smart, and she didn't want it to go to my head, in a different but equally negative way.  I finally took one tonight  urlLink here . Not that internet IQ tests could be deemed really reliable, or anything. But now I know that I'm intelligent, because this test told me. A really intelligent person wouldn't need to take a test to know this.  What does an IQ test really mean, anyways? What is the point of taking one if you don't have to? Just another way of ranking yourself against other people, to assure yourself that you are more intelligent than a certain percentage of people. It only serves to make you feel good, or to make you feel less than good. Who does this serve? Isn't what matters what you actually do in life, and not how smart you are? Do we really need to have yet another scale to rank everyone on where someone always comes out on the bottom?  I admit that I'm curious what everyone's IQ is. But. Do I really want to know, on the off chance that what that score is will change what I think of someone, when it shouldn't?   Actually...yes, I do. So, if you don't mind sharing, fess up. Have you ever taken an IQ test? What's your IQ?

      Went out on Thursday night to Korean lessons for the first time since March. I can't say that my Korean has improved any since then...there are people who've been here a month that know more Korean than me. I got complemented on my pronunciation - but that isn't hard when you're only copying what someone else just said. It isn't much use in real life when I can't remember what the fuck I'm supposed to be pronouncing.  After being here for ten months, I've learned an embarrassingly small amount of Korean. I had all these great aspirations for learning the language when I first arrived. Instead I learned just enough to get me through the normal activities of the day and I rely on a Korean friend whenever I have to do anything other than take a taxi, buy groceries or pay bills.  It's sad. If I was just planning on going home at the end of this contract and never coming back it wouldn't matter. But I want to come back for another year at least. It would make sense to learn the language. It would make my life easier. Hell, it would be the polite thing to do - you live in someone else's country, and you should adjust to it, or at least try.  I'm just so fucking lazy. Learning is hard work.  So of course, after all this hard work learning Korean, we went off for a few drinks. Which turned into more than a few drinks for me. Most people had the sense to turn in by two, but I decided to go off to a norae-bhang (singing room) with a few people. Didn't get home til after five. I think. I woke up Friday around noon, with "Eye of the Tiger" stuck in my head (who picked that damn song?), and not just my ears but my whole body was ringing. Damn soju screwdrivers.   So of course I thought it would be a great idea to repeat it Friday night, too. Didn't get up til two today, didn't do my report cards, so I guess tomorrow is going to be filled with hours of trying to dredge something coherent and relevant to say about a bunch of students I've barely seen in the past month.  How's your weekend going?

      You know, its amazing the difference a foot of hair can make.  Last night, under the influence of absolutely no alcohol or drugs whatsoever, I cut my hair.  Though saying cut doesn't seem an appropriate description for the way I put my hair in a braid and then hacked it off with a pair of kitchen shears. What used to come down to my waist now hits just below my shoulders. Which is maybe not as short as I really wanted it, but I figured I should cut longer so if I made a huge mistake I had something to work with. I may be impulsive, but I'm not stupid.  I feel lighter, I feel happier. I don't feel that headache when its been up for a few hours.   I don't know why I kept it so long. Maybe it made me feel special. I certainly got enough "Wow you're hair is long" type comments every time someone saw it down. Whatever the reasons were, I'm not sad to see it gone.  I think taking it into my own hands, cutting it because I felt like it, and not caring what it looked like made me feel free. And not just free of the weight, but a little more free of society. One that says long hair is beautiful and feminine. That you have to pay someone fourty bucks to make you beautiful.  Next time I just might actually shave it all off.

      Please excuse my rambling...  The wedding was fucking fabulous. I've never been to a wedding before, but I honestly cannot imagine any wedding being better. It was an incredible thing to watch. These two people, up there in front of everyone, expressing their feelings so openly, without any shields or pretense. Letting people see their most intimate emotions. My brother, who has only been playing the guitar since December, wrote a song - an entire song, with a chorus and verses and everything, and played it and sang at the reception in the middle of the dance floor. It was actually pretty good. I had no idea he could do something like that. It was like a romance novel, or the end of the romance novel. It was happily ever after complete with hearts, flowers, and the swelling strains of an orchestra in the background. Not just love, but LOVE. It was so beautiful it almost hurt. I nearly broke my "no tears in public" rule. I know there were plenty of women crying, and even a few men.  And it scared me to death. Up until that moment I don't think I actually believed that love like that existed in the real world. Sure, I know people who are "in love" or in committed relationships or are married, but I always assumed it was a quiter, more we're really good friends kind of thing. Now I'm totally reevaluating everyone - even if they don't feel that in love at this precise moment, there must have been some point when they did feel that way. Watching these two people with their emotions naked for everyone to see scared me. Because I don't think I have the courage to ever let anyone get that close to me.  It reminds of something my English professor told me about Kafka. Kafka was being interviewed, and was asked "Is there no hope?" and he replied "There is hope, but not for us." I think I always imagined the same was true of love - and I don't mean love in general, but the passionate I-would-die-for-you-I-can't-live-without-you-one-perfect-person kind of love. But now, well...  "So, Cheryl, is there no love?" "There is love, but not for me."  Well, that was truly depressing. I'm sure it's just because I need some chocolate.  Here's to love, and one of the most glorious things I've ever seen. Even if I may never experience it myself, knowing that its out there gives me hope. That if humanity has this incredible capacity to love, then perhaps there is hope for the world, and we can fix this incredible mess of a planet we live on. That there's a really good reason to fix it.

      I got back to Korea on Sunday night.  Incheon Airport rocks! The airports in Vancouver and Calgary always seem to be filled with lines and delays and are in general designed to make a person hate airports. Incheon is fucking fabulous. I walked right through immigration and customs - in Vancouver you could spend hours in the lines. Got through Customs, grabbed a bus ticket, and was on my way to Wonju less than an hour after the plane landed.  I can't say that I'm enamoured of the three and a half hours I spent getting home - but it cost less than 20 bucks for the two busses and the taxi that got me there.  Wednesday to Friday this week were Chusok, so I only had to work two days this week.  The first time I came here, everything was so new and exciting. Now, it feels neither new nor exciting, and I feel restless, less content than before I went home. Maybe it's because I've been reminded about everything I've been missing. I was home just long enough to remember all the good bits, without having to deal with much of the everyday shit. I don't feel so inclined to ignore the things that annoy me or piss me off, to write it off in the name of "cultural differences".  I don't want to pretend that I was all lightness and good feelings for the first nine months - cause anyone who knows me knows that isn't me. I know there were a few times I felt really pissed at it all and slagged off Korea pretty good in a few emails. For the most part, I was content to go with the flow, just accept whatever came. I was definately infatuated with the newness and difference of it. And I usually tried not to compare Korea and Canada negatively. Or if I did, it was usually Canada getting the bad review. Now I'm starting to get critical, and it isn't the generic overall criticism of everything Korean that is the irrational response of a person in the midst of culture shock.  Maybe the blinders are off. Or maybe I've just traded them in for a different set.

      I skipped school today. Well, Korean class anyways. Wish I could skip all my other classes.  Today and tomorrow are the fabulous days knows as activity days. This month's theme - Halloween. I've been teaching my kinds about Halloween, getting them to draw and write about a monster, pumping them full of candy, and sending them home. The kids really seem to enjoy talking about the Korean ghosts and monsters that they're familiar with, though I think the scary factor definately loses something in the translation. One ghost, Gumiho, has nine tails, can turn into a fox and eats boys livers. (I guess girls livers don't taste as good - maybe they have not been doused in enough soju?) So far my favorite has to be the 'egg ghost' who has a head like an egg, and according to one student, lives in a bathroom, eats eggs and scares people. No wonder, with that kind of a diet...

      Today is Saturday. I had to work. I hate working Saturdays. Next Saturday is my last ever at Wonderland. It would be so fucking great if it was the last Satuday that I ever had to work on.  I've been a bit remiss about posting lately.... I apologize.  Last weekend I went to Seoul with a friend. We got to Seoul late Saturday evening, and headed straight to Itaewon. The first bar we walked into, we ran into four more guys from Jecheon. And later that night I managed to run into the only two people I know that live in Seoul. It just goes to show you how small the world of the efl teacher in Korea can be.   We ended the night wandering through the seemier part of Itaewon. At one point, we found ourselves walking up a street which must have been the gay district. Four of us wound up sharing a room in some seedy hotel on hooker hill. It was...an experience. (Yeah, yeah, yeah, get your minds out of the gutter. It wasn't   that   kind of experience.) And having had it, I can say that I have no desire to repeat it. I'd rather spend the extra 10000 won and get a room with a bathtub...or even just one with a sink and a mirror in the bathroom. I felt a bit bad after the fact for being the downer on the whole experience. But its never fun having a cold, having your period, and not having any privacy or decent bathing facilities, and having to share what you've got with one other woman and two guys.  The two guys headed back to Jecheon the next morning, and us girls went off in search of English books. Where we ran into yet another guy from Jecheon. After successfully navigating the subway, finding some books, and not to mention staying in a yogwan in Itaewon, we felt we were ready for a challenge - Cheese.  Jecheon has a dearth of proper cheese. About the only thing I've seen here is processed sliced stuff and rubbery almost flavorless "pizza" cheese. Seoul has cheese. Real cheese. I've seen it. Brie, swiss, camembert, nice sharp cheddar, feta, even mascarpone (Tiramisu, anyone?). The first time I was in Seoul, I saw it in a grocery store. But that was in Bundang (rich suburb) in Samsung plaza (snazzy mall - they've got a Chanel boutique there) which maybe implies something about their customer base (lots of money with more cosmopolitan tastes) and therefore a diffence in what they stock. Surely, though, in an area as rife with foreigners as Itaewon, cheese should be just as simple to locate? However, try as we might, the cheese was not to be found. First we went searching by ourselves for some store - couldn't find it. Ask a few people for help. We asked this incredibly nice girl from the Netherlands, who knew where this supermarket was that had Western food. She was walking in that direction, and brought us most of the way. But, unfortunately, none of us seemed to have any inate sense of direction, and without our guide we got confused and couldn't seem to find it.  So went back to Itaewon, drank some more, and did some people watching. Isn't it great how the human psyche can recover so easily from such crushing disappointment? The Great Cheese Trek may have been a failure, but the Pina Coladas were fucking fantabulous.

      I use the same password for practically all my computer accounts. Way back in university (wow, four years, I'm getting old) I took (and almost failed) a programming course. The instructors managed to drill into me - during one of the few lectures I actually attended - that having passwords that aren't easy to guess is really fucking important. Cause we've all read those stupid books or watched movies where some mastermind is foiled because his password is something stupid like his dog's name or the same as his vanity liscense plate, or his birthday. In reverse, but still...  Really, how realistic is it that some computer genius is going to be undone because he can't resist a password that has something to do with his startrek obsession. I knew a guy that was obssessed with StarTrek once, and his password would have been a fucking impossible combo. Though he might have slipped in part of a star date. (Hey - how about your birth date translated into a star date.)  So what does a password need to be? Well, my prof said at least eight characters, a mix of numbers and letters, no doubles side by side, no words, nothing personal, and a non alphanumeric characters.  So I have one of these, and I've been using it since.  Though sometimes some accounts won't let you use non alpha numeric stuff, so I have to alter it a bit. But still, that's only two passwords I have to try to get the right one.  Now, if only I had the same technique for user names. Because those are the stupid things I always forget. They've always got little "oops, you forgot your password" buttons you can click, but never an "oops I forgot who the hell I'm supposed to be on here" button. I really need to start keeping a list of these things someplace. I swear, some sites I've signed up two or three times because I've forgotten the name I used. I can never think of something witty or even applicable that's easy to remember. This is why I'm almost always Cheryl or some variation on my name. And even then I still forget them sometimes.  But if I ever remember, at least I'll know the password...

      I've been noticing lots of dogs lately. Walking from work the other night, I passed a pet store that I've never noticed before. There were all sorts of cute little dogs inside, but the few big dogs were relegated to the outdoors on short leashes. I feel sorry for those dogs. They're not likely to get the kind of home they need - big spaces, lots of exercise. And while I see plenty of people with small dogs walking around (usually carrying the dogs) Lots of times they've got cutesy little outfits on the dogs. I was out for dinner one night, and this guy walks into the restaurant with a dog in his man-bag. A dog with ears dyed flourescent pink. I don't see many with big dogs. Sometimes these small dogs look like puppies that are going to grow up to be rather large. The owners probably get tired of them, annoyed when they outgrow the puppy-cuteness, and abandon them somewhere.   And you know, some people do still eat dog in Korea - though less and less I think. Beat them and eat them - apparently beating them before they kill them is supposed to make the meat more tender. Something to do with adrenaline. Not too far from my apartment, there's a dog farm. Some nights I can hear them barking.  I remember this girl I knew (in Canada) bought a dog. Some sort of uber-cute puppy destined to outgrow his owner. And after a few months, she got rid of it. It wasn't well trained, so it was making a mess of her house. And as it got larger, the messes got bigger and bigger. I don't know what she expected. Its an animal - animals make messes. Even the fairly well trained ones. You can't expect a perfectly behaved dog without a lot of effort.  I don't know where I'm going with this.  I guess it just bothers me, to see people not considering the consequences of what they do. Or that they're aware of the affects their actions might have, but they just don't care. And I'm not talking really long range tough to get used to doing stuff like recycling absolutely everything, and never buying from companies that exploit their workers, and composting and never driving or whatever. Which I am equally guilty of not doing. I'm talkiing the little things, things that are easy to change, easy to do to make life not so shitty for even the complete strangers you come in contact with. Like not buying a dog when you can't give it a good home for the next ten or twenty years, not standing with your friends so that you obstruct the street, not playing your music loudly at four in the morning. But there're always people out there that say - Fuck you, I can play my music as loud as I want and I don't care if it's three am and you have a test tomorrow. It's not my problem. I want to do this, and I want to do it now, and if you don't like it - tough shit. And even when confronted, they stand by their right to do what they want and make your life worse.  It just drives me nuts. It's irrational. It's rude. It's so easy change one thing so that someone else isn't inconvenienced, and yet so many people refuse to do it.  Not that I'm not guilty of it sometimes. I do make an effort not to create too many bumps in other people's lives. And when I'm being an incosiderate jerk, I'm usually unaware that I'm being one. I don't know if that makes it better of worse, though.

      I guess I almost have that teacher's stare down. I turned and stared at her for a couple seconds and she practically ran away.  I didn't think I looked that scary.

      This kid just walked into the PC bhang and sat down beside me. Two of his friends came with him, so now I have an annoying 10 year old girl leaning on my chair and staring at my computer. Go Away!  That is all.

       This post is due to something I read on another blog.  (thanks, Rea)     In a coffee shop: She takes a sip of her coffee, and looks at me. "Jecheon is so boring," she tells me. "Don't you think Jecheon is boring?" "Maybe it's boring, but I do boring well. I like boring," I respond.   The general consensus from most of the people I talk to is that Jecheon is a boring place. It's the Lethbridge of Korea. Or maybe Whitecourt.  Honestly though, I think that boredom is all a state of mind. Like happiness. You can live in a city of 5 million, with everything available to do and to see, and you can still find it all boring. Or you can live in a small town of 10,000 and never be bored.  I might say that I like boring, but what I mean is I don't get bored. Or, more acurately, when I get bored it has less to do with where I am physically and everything to do with where I am in my head. (Maybe this is a bit due to living in a house where if I said I was bored, my parents would usually say, "Great. I need someone to vacuum/dust/clean the ____.")  Likewise, to the question "Are you happy in Jecheon." To which I usually respond, "sure." When I say I'm happy here, what I really mean is that I could be happy here. If I let myself. Sometimes I'm happy. Sometimes I'm not. But my happiness isn't dependent on a place, or situation. Of course, it's a lot easier to be happy if you live in a place you like, with people you like, doing a job you enjoy. But even if you have all those things, happiness can still elude you. And even when you don't have these things, you can still be happy.  John Stuart Mills said, "ask yourself if you are happy and you cease to be so." So you can be happy. And know that you are happy. But if you begin to question it, then it will disappear. Which is inevitably what I do to myself. "Hey, I'm happy? Wait a second, am I sure? How can I be happy if I'm not this and I don't have that," etc, etc, ad nauseum, ad infinitum. Happiness, for me anyways, takes a bit of head work sometimes. It seems that the times I should be happiest are the times I get all stupidly introspective and think myself out of it.  And I think a similar kind of thing goes for boredom. Ask yourself if you are bored and you will be. Its in your head, not your environment. There are always interesting things you can do, even by yourself. (Hey, get you minds out of the gutter! That's not what I mean.)  I remember when I was a kid, and I could spend hours playing in the fresh cut grass, just me and my imagination. Racing a bike through the endless puddles of mud in the spring, for the sheer fun of getting covered in dirt. Going for a walk in the first snowfall, listening to the sound it makes as it falls, as I made the first tracks of the winter. Or in university when I could sit down in the library with a new idea and lose all track of time while I explored it. Some people might say these are all boring things - sometimes I might say they were boring. I feel sorry for that. We've become jaded by the fast pace of life, accustomed to having a million different opportunities and activities available, and lost the ability or desire to experience the joy that exists even in very simple things. We don't engage ourselves fully in what we do, and consequently we don't enjoy it, we get bored.  Of course, this is a really long winded answer to a question like "Are you bored?"  Are you bored?

      I've just spent the past eight hours in Seoul looking for gifts. I'm at the Express Bus Terminal waiting to catch a bus back to Jecheon. You know, its pretty cool when you can find a computer to use while you're waiting for your bus.

      Y'know, I thought of my new resolution to lower my caffeine intake this morning. I woke up around one thirty in the afternoon, feeling like shit with my stomach in my throat and my heart trying to pound out of my chest. I had a vague recollection of calling and talking to my Mom and Dad when I got home around five in the morning. And something suddenly occurred to me. What was this sudden inspiration, you might ask? That it'd be way better if I worried about cutting back on drinking and smoking, instead of coffee.

      Coffee, coffee, coffee...mmmm, I love coffee. Which is unfortunate, cause it ain't readily available in Jecheon. Sure, there are some places you can get real coffee - not in my usual path, unfortunately. And you can get that pseudo-instant-faux coffee everywhere, but really...can we actually call that stuff coffee? Yeah, yeah, I know I could make it myself...but that's not the point. In Seoul there are plenty of coffee shops all over the place, usually blatantly attempting to imitate Starbucks name or logo. (But who wants to drink coffee at a place called Coobucks?)  Anyways, I have been drinking this premixed instant coffee stuff at work pretty much since I've been in Korea. It comes in a little package with creamer and sugar already added, so all you have to do is add water. Its really handy, and though it isn't great coffee, it has that one vital component - caffeine. I've become a little addicted to the stuff. Maybe more than a little addicted. In fact, it has lately occurred to me that I've been drinking way too much of it and I should quit, or at least cut back. Just at work. Sniff, sniff. I'll really miss you, Maxim Mocha Gold instant coffee. Where will I get my caffeine fix now?   Ode to caffeine  Oh, caffeine, you're my best friend without you, I can't pretend that I won't fall asleep and snore While teaching Basic-C4 I won't be able To sit at the table I'll slip right under and hit my head on the floor

      I'm blogging from work today. I came in early because I'm supposed to teach a class to some of the Korean teachers, but they're all busy today. I can't say that I'm overly dissapointed. I've got a nasty cold again. I was hoping the huge amounts of vitamin C I've been ingesting would keep it away, but nothing is a match for the nasty Korean cold virus spread by little children who don't wash their hands and like to climb all over you.  But perhaps I shouldn't blame my cold on the kids. Perhaps staying out until four in the morning on Tuesday had something to do with lowering my resistance. Or maybe I should blame it on Seoul.  I went to Seoul last Saturday and did some serious shopping. Wandering around the city at about 10 am is really nice, because you can still wander without being herded by the incredible numbers of people that materialize a few hours later.  There's the bell. Gotta go and plan my classes.

      I went to Korean lessons last night, then went out for beer with a couple of friends and was in bed before two am - early for me. Maybe they put something in the beer, because I had the closest thing to a nightmare since I've been in Korea.  I was walking down this narrow one lane road that wound its way through the rice paddies not far from my apartment. This road was barely wide enough for one vehicle, and dropped off five feet on either side into the paddies. It was pitch black - no street lights - and for some reason I was trying to catch a taxi. One started to come down the road, lights off. I tried to flag it down, but it obviously wasn't going to stop. Then I suddenly realized there wouldn't be enough room for me and the taxi on the road, so I stepped to the side, and quickly started sliding right down into some dirt or grass. By the time the taxi passed I was waist deep in it, and couldn't haul myself back onto the road. I heard a couple ahead of me talking (Korean people, but speaking English), and just as I managed to get back on the road and started to speak, the man hit the woman. I wished I had stayed in the muck, because then he shot her and turned around and shot me.  I woke up - and just as I was nearly asleep again, at 4:15 this bloody fire alarm went off in the apartment building. What is it? Are the north Koreans attacking? Is there a gas leak? A fire? The alarm stopped fairly quickly, so I went back to sleep. Maybe ignoring it and staying in the building wasn't the smartest thing, but this happened once before, and I figured if it was really important, the alarm would stay on.  Anyways, it turns out some guy got drunk, decided to make some soup, then took off his clothes and went to sleep, in somebody else's apartment, apparently, and without turning the soup off. Maybe someone put something in his beer too.

      I've started drinking beer. Given the price of non-beer drinking, the lower availability, and the fact that I just feel left out when everyone else is splitting a pitcher except me, it was only a matter of time before I gave in.  Why is this a good thing?  Well, I don't like beer nearly as much as other drinks, so I drink less, and am more willing and able to cut myself off. It's harder to drink enough to get totally wasted. I can't chug it the way I can other drinks. Or shoot it. Beer has less sugar than the shit I usually drink, so less calories. Beer has more vitamin B6. I hear B vitamins are good to take to stave off a hangover. Beer can increase your HDL cholesteral - the good stuff. Its more social to drink the same as everyone else, instead of being the "Oh, no, I can't drink that" annoying person.  So, now I drink beer. Korean beer, anyways. Beer with names like Hite (hi-tuh) and Cass. I don't know if I could handle real beer though.

      I have futilely been trying to log onto my yahoo email account for the past couple hours. grrrrrrrr.  Does anyone else feel like they should be doing something else? Lately, I've been having this vague feeling of failure, like what I'm doing with my life isn't what I'm supposed to be doing. Like I'm not fulfilling my destiny. I feel like I should be doing something important.   "Wait," I tell my self, "what makes you think what you're doing now isn't important? It is, maybe just in small ways to a few people, but it is."   I know this. I believe this. Everyone is important, everything we do everyday has meaning and consequence beyond what we can be aware of. But I'm not talking this kind of relative importance. And I don't mean fame. I mean Important with a capital I, the Important that people write songs about and winds up in history books, the Important that Makes A Difference.  Am I the only person that feels this way?  I don't feel like I should be  more   important than other people. I don't think I'm better than anyone else. I know it's arrogant of me to think that my life is meant to be important, that I should be important, and maybe fallacious to assume that anyone has any destiny or intended purpose at all. In my head I know this, and tell myself this. But in my heart.... Well, you get raised on a diet of heroic, epic struggles, emotional turmoil and fantasy, and maybe you start to feel like this is the way life should be. I think I should be important, that eveyone should be important. That there should be some great quest or search, and we all have a part, though some are larger than others. I don't feel like I should have the biggest part, or be the most important, just that I should have one.  Is it possible I can blame my current unease on too much reading? Do fairytales make bad bedtime stories for children of three or four? Is it all my mother's fault, for reading them to me, and then taking that children's lit class when I was eight years old, leaving books like   The Wizard of Earthsea ,   The Dark is Rising ,  and more volumes of fairytales laying about the house? Would I be happier if I had watched more Looney Toons and not ever encountered Mary Stewart's books about Merlin and King Arthur? Who cares - You can never really know all the things that shaped the person you are at this moment.  But writing this, I've reminded myself that I am important in ways that I will never know, in ways no one will ever know. That we are all important, its just that we're too small to see exactly why. The man who eats an apple and chucks the core on the grass never realizes, nor does anyone else, that it will grow into a tree and two hundred years later its going to fall down, cause a car accident that means two people will meet and eventually have a great grandson, who will write a book that changes a mans life and influences the way he raises his son, who will cure cancer only because of that. Or some shit like that.   Maybe what's really making me discontent is that I'm not trying to be much of anything at all. That even if I know what I should do, I never bother to go and do it.  Or maybe I just need to get...better chocolate.

      Me and my mental garbage are back after a three week hiatus that consisted mainly of excessive cooking and baking followed by excessive consumption. A belated Merry Christmas to everyone. Hope that you, unlike me, weren't quite as excessive, and won't be paying for it by avoiding all sugar for the next month. Well, as soon as I eat this last brownie...can't let them just sit around...they'll go bad if they aren't eaten.  I have just made my biggest purchase since I paid my last semester of tuition. The rush I get from spending large amounts of money is fantastic (Yay me, look at this thing I traded some smelly paper for.) Right up until the nausea hits (Oh my god I can't believe I just spent that much money).   I spent the day shopping with my Dad for a computer, and I am now the proud owner of a Toshiba Satellite. It isn't the one I really wanted - that one had a 15.4" screen, a larger hard drive and nifty silver case. But this one cost $500 less.  The best thing about this is absolutely the wireless internet capabiilities. My parents' two computers were already on a wireless network. So all I had to do was plug into it and now if I want I can stay in my room and look at internet porn at 4am. Not that that was my main purpose in buying it, you understand, but its nice to know that you can do it, even if you don't want to.  I just hope I don't do something to break the thing.

      So one night, a bunch of us English teachers were out at a bar, and we were playing this game. Like "If you were a tree, what tree would you be". Except, its not trees, and you don't get to pick what you are, everyone else gets to decide what you are. Unfortunately - lots of fun, but lots of people get a little offended by some of the stuff. Which makes it even more fun. This is what I can remember - but I was pretty inebriated at the time, so maybe not completely correctly.  My name would be Norah. (hmmmm, okay) If I were a fruit, I'd be a grapefruit. (Ugh) If I were a vegetable, I'd be a cauliflower. (double ugh) If I were a piece of furniture, I'd be a coffee table. (?) If I were an item of clothing, I'd be gloves. (WTF?) If I were a city, I'd be Sofia. (In Bulgaria?) If I were a country, I'd be Chechnya. Or Palestine. (Apparently, if I were a country, I'd be a non-country) If I were a building, I'd be a mosque. (Not too sure I remember this one right...) If I were a famous singer or band, I'd be Nana Mouskouri. (AAHHHHHH!!!!) If I were a drink, I'd be a white russian. (Okay, I can live with that.)

      Two days back and I'm already shovelling it.  There is nothing that feels quite so futile as shovelling snow when its still snowing. Especially when you've got a triple width driveway and a corner lot with sidewalk all the way around. You shovel the sidewalk, shovel half the driveway, shovel the other half, and the sidewalk and first half are covered again.  And there is nothing so annoying as having your mother drive her car over the unshovelled driveway two or three times, compacting the snow and making it impossible to get off. Except maybe watching a chinook come in the next day and melt all the snow off a driveway your neighbor never bothered to shovel.  Home is so much easier to love when you aren't there.

      The problem with being home is the well stocked pantry. And refridgerator and freezer. My Mom made a cake for me when I came home - double fudge chocolate. It was my sister's birthday yesterday, so she made this chocolate mousse. And we have a cheesecake sitting in the fridge. Not to mention all the cookies, candy and other stuff around here. This house is a diabetics worst nightmare. It will be fucking hard not to gain 10 pounds living here. And it isn't even Christmas yet.  In Korea, I generally bought enough food for a few days, but there was never much in my apartment. My fridge was never full, and not just because it worked like shite and had a tendency not to keep things cool, or to freeze them. I'm wondering if this was a reaction to the general excess that seems to exist in this house. The fridge is crammed so full of stuff you can't put any more in, we have another fridge full of more stuff downstairs, the pantry is full, the deep freeze is full, the cold room is full. This house is fat. I'm surprised it hasn't had a heart attack. Okay, maybe there are six people living here now, but we couldn't eat everything in a month. Who needs six types of salad dressing and four types of BBQ sauce at one time?

      I am home in Calgary - with baggage! The flights were on time, I didn't have to wait for hours on end in lines, and they didn't lose my bags this time. I've still got a few issues with the whole trip, though. For one, while the Air Canada staff on the flight from Vancouver to Calgary were super nice and cheerful, and the Korean Air Canada staff were also, there were a few ladies (white, over fourty, with blond early nineties hair styles) on the ride from Incheon to Vancouver that were pretty snarky. It was to the end of the flight, but still... And whichever one was making the English announcements was not good at it at all. She sounded like she had no idea what was going on. Which isn't exactly comforting - here you are, on a 2000 ton chunk of metal hurtling through the sky, defying the laws of gravity using technology you really don't understand so it might as well be magic, and the people who are supposed to make you feel safe and comfortable sound just as unknowledgeable as you.  And the food sucked. As per usual. They're always talking about their fabulous meal selections in that stupid Enroute Air Canada magazine, showing beautiful pictures - with the tiny tiny type at the bottom saying its only available in business, not economy. And people say we live in a classless society. What made it worse was that we got our first meal just before we hit some turbulence, and I felt sick for the next eight hours. Ugh.  But I did get to watch three movies I hadn't seen - The Italian Job, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, and XMen2.  I'm pretty tired right now, so I have no idea if this is coherent or not.  I already miss Korea (well not everything about it, but a few things).

      The point of being alive is to be alive, to interact with people, isn't it? So why are things like the movies, TV, things that don't promote any social interaction, why are they so important, why are they such an integral part of our lives? (I guess you could say the same thing about reading but I think there's a fundamental difference there...) I mean, we even have TV shows about movies and the people in movies...stupid 3 hour long broadcasts of golf or some other sports - shouldn't people go out and play them instead of watching them being played? You don't have to have any talent to be entertained - the best time I ever had playing sports was in grade 11 when my handball team went to a tournament and got whipped by one team 20-2.  Among other (un)interesting things that happened to me (other than being drunk) (its my brother's birthday so I have reason) (and if you haven't noticed by now that I'm slightly intoxicated, then you aren't nearly as insightful as I thought you might be) I went to guitarworks and bought a guitar stand, I made some awesome cilantro-pecan pesto, and I almost got rear-ended (on my way to guitar works). Don't you hate it when you have a near miss on the road? For that day, anyways, it kinda takes all the fun out of driving...   Course, it could have been worse. He could actually have hit me. That really would have sucked.   Look for the silver lining, when e'er a cloud...

      I just finished reading  urlLink Everyone in Silico  by Jim Munroe. It was a great book, for anyone that likes reading stuff that's strange, funny and slightly disturbing. If you've read  urlLink Jennifer Government , the underlying theme (beware unrestrained capitalism) is the same, but while  Jennifer Government  is completely over the top,  Everyone in Silico  is creepy in the way that you read it and think that it's almost possible.  I'm now starting  Pandora's Picnic Basket , about genetically modified food. It seemed to be the only book in the library that didn't either vilify or deify GM right off the bat. gotta get educated for the next time a good argument rolls along.  Other books on my to be read pile right now include:  urlLink The Trouble With Islam ,  Goodbye Canada , a few history books (British empire, Caribbean, 19th century), five romance novels, three other paperbacks, and  The Navigator of New York , which I was given for Christmas but just can't seem to find the interest to pick up and start. And I am waiting anxiously for the day when Laurell K. Hamilton's next book comes out (If you have no interest in werewolves, vampires, zombies or fairies, then you'll have no idea who she is and wouldn't care anyways.)  I also have this weird desire to read, at the same time,  Treason  by Ann Coulter, and Al Franken's  Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them , mostly because I saw them in Chapters one day, sitting side by side on the current events table and had this odd image of them spontaneously combusting upon contact with each other.  Anyone else reading anything interesting lately?

      Well, its nearly four am and I've had a pretty decent Saturday. My Mom had some friends over for dinner, which I got to enjoy as well. She went all out and did a whole Mexican thing - ceviche, homemade tostados and salsa and guacamole, enchiladas, and more.... And some nice company and decent conversation.  I don't know about most people, but I really enjoy a good argument. Not a real argument, not as in a vicious contentious angry one, but just a discussion where people have opposing views on things. Or even just pretend to have opposing views on things. Sometimes, I don't even think I'm sure of what I feel about something until I have to come out and say it and discus it. Or I listen to other people and start to understand something I've never thought about.   How can you have an opinion unless you argue it? How can you form one without hearing different sides? How can you maintain it unless you continually challenge it? Otherwise, aren't you just repeating yourself, without thinking, stagnating? Besides, if you argue it out with intelligent people you like and respect, its much easier to get one up on that annoying person you're forced to sit next to at school/the office Christmas party/family reunion/etc.  And as I am now seeing two of everything on this screen, and slurring my typing, I think I better go to bed.

      George W. delivered the  urlLink state of the union  this week. Why am I writing about the state of the union and George W Bush if I'm not American? Well, because it's there, and what he says is annoying. Why is this my business? Because George seems to like to push his values as if they should be the values of the whole planet. And it's America, so sometimes his agenda ends up being the global agenda. And some of what he says is just patently false.   The pathetic part of this is, people sit in front of their TV's, they watch the whole thing, or they watch sound bites on the news later, they listen to the applause that follows his words, they nod their heads and don't even bother to question what's said. TV is a passive medium, it doesn't encourage dialogue or even thought, really. I'm not claiming to be any better. I know I think a thousand times more about what I read than anything I watch on TV. Someone needs to point out after all the misleading or asinine things said for the benefit of the viewing public, so they can at least start to think about it. Some people do. But they never get as much airtime.   Anyways, here's the bits that were really easy to make fun of and poke at. Americans are proving once again to be the hardest working people in the world.  Sure, George, tell that to the sixteen year old Indonesian girl working fourteen hours a day making all those hardworking Americans cheap shoes. Twenty-eight months have passed since September 11th, 2001 -- over two years without an attack on American soil. And it is tempting to believe that the danger is behind us. That hope is understandable, comforting -- and false... The terrorists continue to plot against America and the civilized world.  Anyone else think this makes him sound like a nut-job conspiracy theorist? But let us be candid about the consequences of leaving Saddam Hussein in power. We're seeking all the facts. Already, the Kay Report identified dozens of weapons of mass destruction-related program activities and significant amounts of equipment that Iraq concealed from the United Nations. Had we failed to act, the dictator's weapons of mass destruction programs would continue to this day.  Jeez, George, if I hadn't been paying a bit of attention to the news, I'd actually think that you found weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Which you didn't, if you forgot.  Had we failed to act, Security Council resolutions on Iraq would have been revealed as empty threats, weakening the United Nations  And you saying to hell the UN , lets go kick some ass didn't weaken the UN? That statute protects marriage under federal law as a union of a man and a woman, and declares that one state may not redefine marriage for other states. Activist judges, however, have begun redefining marriage by court order, without regard for the will of the people and their elected representatives. On an issue of such great consequence, the people's voice must be heard. If judges insist on forcing their arbitrary will upon the people, the only alternative left to the people would be the constitutional process. Our nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.  Oh, gimme a fucking break. "The people's voice"? Courts exist to protect people, often the minority, not enforce the will of the majority.  The cause we serve is right, because it is the cause of all mankind. The momentum of freedom in our world is unmistakable -- and it is not carried forward by our power alone.   Right. You claiming to represent the will of 6 billion people? I know your cause isn't the same as mine. I don't believe that the world must "pursue an aggressive, pro-growth economic agenda," or defend your version of marriage, or push trade agreements like CAFTA and the FTAA. So maybe that's all mankind minus one.  And as for freedom...well, it definitely isn't American power that creates more. The people of Argentina and Mexico probably wouldn't agree with you, after watching American promoted policies implemented in their countries, creating less freedom and economic security as a result. Canada has less freedom, less control over our own resources and borders.  I'd say I feel like I have less personal freedom today than four years ago. I never used to worry about waiting in line for the bathroom on an airplane, or being beaten up for protesting something, or getting stopped and searched in the States because I was born in Arabia. I never used to think that someone might be sitting there scanning the internet for terrorist threats and decide I might be one because of what I read or say. Or that you could throw someone in jail for a couple years without giving them a trial because they 'might' be a terrorist. I never used to think that democratic governments would hand citizens rights over to corporations in blind pursuit of wealth, that the government cared more for economics than humanity. But maybe I'm just better informed now, and I suppose I can thank George W Bush for being such an idiot that I felt it was necessary.

      Today I was up before 8am, which is pretty much unheard of unless I have to catch a plane, or there's a fire or other life threatening emergency. But we're having the furnaces cleaned, and since for whatever reason my mother thinks it's inappropriate for me to be sleeping while they do it, I'm awake. Right now I'm trapped in my room with the dog, because he goes nuts and barks and runs around and generally gets in the way of anyone and anything. He's cute, but he ain't that bright, and he's a big coward.  We're also getting a new washing machine and dryer today. The other night (after I had finished doing all my laundry earlier that day) my sister started doing her laundry and...well, I'm not sure what happened, but when I went downstairs it smelled like something was burning. Anyways, the dog is pretty much guaranteed to be barking and whining nonstop until they're all through, so its not like I'd be able to sleep anyways.  For lack of any other constructive activity, I changed my color-scheme. Now my blog is nice and green and springy looking and definately not wintery and minus 20. Which its going to be next week, so I better haul my ass out of the house today and enjoy the weather.

      For Christmas this year, I got one of those page a day calendars called "Forgotten English". My favorite words so far, both used in the 17th century, are:  coffee-wit - a person who orates, gossips, or opines, on everything under the sun, attempting to impress people as he misquotes Nietzsche, all while clasping his grande-double-nofat-nofoam-cafelatte to add a certain caffeinated mystique to his verbosity. (Well, that's my definition anyways. Originally, it wasn't meant in the perjorative sense, only as in a person who orated in a coffee house, kind of like Speaker's corner. But I think mine is more appropriate currently.)  assishness - come on, as if it isn't obvious.  Now lets use them in a sentence: The coffee-wit's assishness was apparent when he indicated his admiration of the American president's intelligence and integrity.

       urlLink Monsanto and Schmeiser  have hit the supreme court. I guess we'll be finding out soon whether you'll be able to patent GM foods in Canada. Pesonally, I think you shouldn't be able to. It's not something that is easily contained - like the organic GMO free food company in BC that anounced despite their best efforts, their food had traces of GMOs. And how can you justify enforcing a law about it - if my neighbor pays for some GM grass, and it grows on my lawn too, is someone going to sue me for it? Even if I know it's there and my grass looks so much lusher and greener because of it, and I win best lawn in Calgary, I didn't go out and steal the grass. It would be like someone patenting a computer program that infects any computer it comes in contact with, and then charging all the people whose computers now run it.  You can't patent genes - where's the line? Can someone patent green eyes and then charge me for having them?

      Why is it that when I get these sudden impulses to clean and organize things they always hit me late in the afternoon or evening so I'm guaranteed not to be finished before 1am?  I've been trying to box up some of my books and CDs and clean out the junk in my drawers today. (I realized while doing this where all the money I've made in my life has mostly gone.) But its impossible for me to go to sleep when there's a hundred books lying on the floor (and that's an understatement, not an exaggeration).  I don't seem to have any problems going to bed when my room is messy as per usual, with clothes and junk and maybe only 25 books lying on the floor. It's only when I'm in the middle of one of these cleaning binges that everything must be put back before I feel like I can go to bed. Do other people have weird compulsions like this?

      Taco Bell buys tomatoes picked by laborers in Florida that get paid truely shitty wages. How shitty? Well, some of them were being paid the same as the 1978 wage (as of two years ago, I didn't see any facts for this year). Which meant they had to pick around 2 tons of tomatoes to make about 50 bucks. That's a lot of tomatoes. But you know, we gotta have our tacos cheap, wouldn't want to pay an extra 2 cents per burrito so someone could make a living wage. Go visit  urlLink Boycott the Bell .  Of course, once you start reading, you realize that this applies to your oranges and juice and tons of produce out there. There's probably legitimate reasons to boycott 90% of the stuff we buy. Its a depressing thought.  Oh well, gotta start somewhere. I never liked Taco Bell that much anyways.

      I am back from Mexico with a sunburn, some really annoying insect bites and a bottle of tequila.  Mexico was awesome, the resort was beautiful. Fantastic weather, beaches. The entire area was beautiful - I was told that the movie "Blue Lagoon" was filmed around there. I managed to get out of the resort every day to do the obligatory tourist things - see the ruins at Tulum and Chichen Itza (and climb the pyramid), visit some towns.  The absolute best place we went had to be Xel-Ha (sounds like shell-ha). It calls itself an eco-water park or something. You can wander through paths in the forest, and around the lagoons, see tons of iguanas and birds, cenotes. You can also get a tube or a snorkel and go swimming. The whole system is connected and you can spend days and days and not see everything, but it was incredible, I've never been snorkeling before, I saw tons of fish, some of them huge (like three feet I swear) and I'm glad they didn't get too close, I know they don't want to eat me, but I can't help feeling a little nervous. We spent the entire day there, most of it in the water, and I got a sunburn but it was worth it.

      On the news tonight, there was a person talking about something I wasn't really listening to. Anyways, in her report she used the word 'orientate'. Does this word seem less news like than 'orient' to anyone else? I looked up both  urlLink orient  and  urlLink orientate . They're pretty much interchangable as verbs, as in "I oriented/orientated myself towards the river and began walking." But when I hear 'orient' I think 'foreign correspondent/news anchor'. When I hear 'orientate', I think 'ditzy blond weather-girl'. Not that there's anything wrong with that.  Am I the only person that feels this way? Is there any difference between these words? And why do I care about this enough to waste time when I should be packing so I can go out for kareoke night?

      On the front page (below the fold) of the National Post today was an article "Airplane bathroom lineups percieved as security risk."  Lineups for the washroom on long international flights appear to be the latest security threat to the United States. On Christmas eve, with airlines increasingly unnerved over terror warnings, the US Transportation Security Administration notified all airlines that passengers should no longer be allowed to "congregate in groups" near the toilets on flights into American airspace.   Umm...excuse me? Exactly what are they supposed to do, start handing out hallway passes?

      Did I mention I'm going to Mexico? My mother booked the tickets yesterday. We're leaving on Friday. So today I've been practicing useful things to say in Spanish, such as  'hola' - hello 'adios' - goodbye 'dos cerveza, por favor' - two beers, please 'soy de Canada' - I'm from Canada 'hasta nunca' - get lost 'puta' - bitch; 'hijo de puta' - son of a bitch 'mierda' - shit; so I guess you could also say 'es mierda' - it's shit 'fuego' - fire (though it could be incendio)  I didn't know that lonely planet phrasebooks came complete with swearwords. It's pretty handy.  Gotta go pack  Hasta luego!

      Today I decided I was woefully uneducated about current events. While mucking about on the internet I ran into some stuff about a place called  urlLink Nauru , a tiny island where Australia apparently dumps their refugees for a year or two, until said refugees are so frustrated they go on a  urlLink hunger strike . Which they've been on for three weeks. But this apparently does not make the news in Canada in the Christmas season, as we might not be interested in stuffing our faces with holiday goodies after seeing the photos of people with their mouths sewn shut. Or maybe it has, and I'm even more out of the current events loop than I realized.  This is tragic. Governments get so wrapped up in their rules, worrying about setting precedents and possible ramifications and what if these refugees are really super dangerous terrorists? They lose site of the reality that these are also human beings, and treat them all like dangerous criminals. We pursue our own economic and social security at the cost of another person's humanity. And in doing so, don't we lose part of own humanity? We can't call ourselves civilized if we subject people to this type of treatment for the sake of the hypothetical.  Australia and Canada are countries first populated by immigrants, refugees and criminals (who were also sent to Canada, btw). Shouldn't we then be more than willing to open our arms to anyone seeking refuge - whether merely from a tragically low standard of living, or a murderous political regime? Yet we don't, and we make it difficult, more than it should be. I can't claim to be well informed on the process of claiming refugee status in Canada, but I don't think it's any better than Australia's. But I guess I'll learn - CBC has a docudrama on about it this week.   Anyone else watching  urlLink Human Cargo ?

      My mother, sister and I went to the  urlLink Glenbow museum  today and saw the  urlLink bog people  exhibit. My sister thought it was "boring". My mother thought it was interesting. And I thought it was a little of both. But I also thought it was manipulative and annoying. When they talked about the science behind it, or the history, that was interesting. But the way they presented some of it seemed over-produced. They've got artifacts stuck up with little blurbs about them, and then beside it some stupid comment like "a life...the ultimate sacrifice". It seemed trite. No one's denying that getting yourself killed and dumped in a swamp may have been the ultimate sacrifice, but just the way they point things out...that they feel the need to point it out, bothers me. They made this reproduction of a sixteen year old girl that was found in a bog, and had a recording set up so that it looked like it was talking. In French with an English translation. And a spooky soundtrack. Gimme a fucking break. This isn't history, or science. It's a fun-house carnival. They're trying to turn it into entertainment. Give you a few thrills, chills and a little science and you feel like you've spent the day doing something educational with your annoying teenage son who was more interested in my sister's ass. And it makes it feel cheap, not to mention a little demeaning for the dead. And then the directions as you go from one part to another "as you tour the blah-blah, think about blah blah blah...". Yeah, I can figure out what to think for myself, thanks. Just give me the facts, even tell me what other people think, but don't tell me what to think.  And stick an age limit on it. There's nothing more annoying than two noisy five year old boys running around and knocking things over when you're trying to look at dead people.

      I went shopping today, for the third time this month. I'm stocking up for a year in a country that doesn't carry a lot of deodorant, bras in my size or pants with hips. One of the things I bought was, ironically, a book called The High Price of Materialism by Tim Kasser.  I was reminded of something my 19th century European history prof said. (He was one of the most interesting professors I ever had. Gave an entire lecture on horse shit, well horses, their shit, and the effect they had on England, and made it really interesting.) He always brought his lectures around to the effect of historical events in contemporary society. Which was particularly pertinent as so many ideas or movements that affect us still were just beginning to grow in that time period. This was an era that saw industrialization, the growing secularization of society, the birth of the department store. And he tells us the mall is the cathedral of the 21st century. And who is God?  In the forward to the book it says: At this point in human history, we have enough resources to feed, clothe, shelter and educate every living individual on Earth. Not only that: we have at the same time the global capacity to enhance health care, fight major diseases, and considerably clean up the environment. We can do this he says, but instead we have the third/first world, resources concentrated in a small group of people, becoming more stratified, even within first world countries. And why is this? This global reality exists, however, because people, and I mean each one of us, can so readily be converted to the religions of consumerism and materialism. A sobering thing for me to read standing in the middle of a monument to consumerism, shopping bags at my feet, a Starbucks Chai Latte in my hand.  Of course, my momentary pause to consider this was followed by me plunking down 20 bucks for the book, and then another hour of temporarily sating my materialistic desires. Hmmmm...but now I think I really need a new pair of shoes...

      That's the first time I've said that name in a while that isn't going to send me to hell, as my Mother warns me.  So, is anyone planning on going and seeing The Passion of Christ?  I have to admit, I want to see it partly because everyone is talking about it. I also don't want to see it becasue everyone is talking about it. Also, its not like I don't know the story. No surprise endings here people. I've been reading the reviews that have been coming out, and it seems like it's going to be pretty ugly. As in bloody and violent. And I don't know that I want to have that sitting in my brain.  One thing that confuses me, though, is the talk about this movie promoting anti-semetism. I don't really understand it. I mean, is anyone worried about it being anti-Roman? Every movie has protagonists and antagonists, every movie could be thought of as anti-something. Pearl Harbor - anti-Japanese. Bloody Sunday - anti British. Clerks - anti-stupid people. Titanic - anti-iceberg.  Whatever. I don't think its an issue. We all know the story, and 99% of us don't run around yelling Christ killer to Jews. Or Italians. This movie is not going to create some upsurge in anti-semetic sentiment. Most people probably won't even bother to watch the movie, given that the whole thing is in Latin and Aramaic. As my sister says - I want to watch a movie, I don't want to read it.

      Some  urlLink Koreans  were caught being smuggled into the US across the border in Alberta. On foot.  What, being in Canada wasn't good enough? I think I'm a little offended on behalf of our nation. Everyone wants the American Dream. What the hell is wrong with the Canadian dream? And couldn't they have picked a better time of the year for it? If I was going to smuggle myself across - on foot - I'd make sure it was during the summer. Not great weather for a hike. And you never know when you're going to get dumped on by a major snow storm. Actually, give how decent the weather has been lately, we're probably due for one soon...  Seriously, though, I spent a year in Korea, and will be spending another year there, and I never felt like it was such a horrible place that I would run away to live illegally in another country. Which probably points to how good Korea can be at shoving the shittiest bits of life there under the rug.  The police said that their English skills were "negligible." There's a lot of fucking resources to learn English available in Korea, and you don't have to pay 50000 won an hour for them. Jeez, you can get a stupid "teach yourself whatever language in 40 lessons or less" course for less than that, and if you actually did it you'd come out being able to hold at least a small conversation. Plus they teach English in the school system there all through. Obviously, it ain't a great system, if how many years of education in English equals negligible skill.  And you know what's ironic, is that probably these people couldn't get good jobs in Korea, and the reason they couldn't was because they didn't have good English scores. So they hope that life will be better for them in a country where everyone speaks English.

      Of all the things they could possibly cut, they're cutting free coffee? Does this make sense? We all know that the free coffee you get at work (where ever it is) generally tastes like shit, but they have it there for a reason. I mean, do we really want our hospital staff feeling all groggy and not up to par because they missed their coffee, while they dish out medication or do surgery or order antibiotics or even just disinfect things?

      Because this is my favorite refrain when talking about just about anything...  ...and I know I've said it to just about everyone...  ...I read it somewhere, I can't remember...   Perception is nine tenths of reality.   It doesn't really matter what the truth is, or what the world is like. It doesn't matter how everyone else sees reality. The "truth" doesn't matter. The objective truth, anyways.  To the individual, its all about their perception, so it's totally warped or skewed, okay. But that's the way they see the world. And no matter how much anyone else talks, that's probably not going to change.  Just letting you know.  I know my own perception of the world is filtered. Through rose colored/rainbow-striped/brown smoke colored lenses.  But at least I recognize that my reality isn't reality.  It's a start.  Maybe a really small one, but it is.

      Oh, no!  urlLink The fish  have escaped and are now wreaking havoc in aquariums across the country!  If Environment Canada was doing it's job properly, the fish never would have been in the country in the first place. That they expect the stores to pay for this mistake seems unfair. If a large number of the fish have already been sold, isn't it too late anyways? A risk assessment? The fish are living in an aquarium. It's not like there's a huge danger of them getting into the environment. Or surviving once they get there.  I'm not against genetic engineering per se. I don't know how great an idea it is to be fiddling around with something that isn't completely understood. But people do that all the time. My concerns about GM are more about the fact that it's difficult to contain and keep seperate from non-GM organisms in the environment. And that it seems like people are trying to use it as a bandaid on problems like deficient nutrition and hunger, when what we really need is some serious surgery.  But you wanna dye your fish a pretty color and give them stripes? I don't care as long as I don't have to worry my sole is going to show up on my plate one day looking like a tiger.

      Happy Valentines Day!  I am spending this one, like the last 23, without a particular person to share it with. I've never been in a significant relationship. Never been in love, or had my heart broken. Never cried over a man. And I don't feel bad about it. Well, maybe just a little.  I remember in elementary school, how we all used to give Valentines to the rest of the kids in the class - my mother insisted that I give one to everyone. I never worried about not having a boyfriend then. Then I hit the teens, and I was suddenly desperate to have a boyfriend. Not because there was anyone in particular I was mooning over, but just because it seemed like I would have failed if I didn't have one, one of the things I thought I had to have or do to be normal. Good grades? Check. Friends? Check? Dislike parents, reject authority, get drunk and throw up? Check, check, check. Boyfriend...? OH GOD I HAVE NO BOYFRIEND I'M SUCH A LOSER! Thankfully, I have progressed from the angst-ridden younger self I once was, and I am no longer convinced that being alone on Valentine's Day means I am completely worthless. Now, I can mostly look at it as just another day. If it doesn't bother me the other 364 days of the year, why should this one be different?  But, as I said, I do feel just a little bad when February 14th rolls around. I think the problem with Valentines day for me, is it seems to be this cultural event that I am perpetually excluded from. Sure, a single person can go out, hang with other single friends, have a great time. This day has always been about lovers though, not friends. I can't really participate in it. I feel left out. It's like everyone is eating cheese and I'm lactose intolerant. I don't miss the cheese, I just want to be like everyone else. Stupid herd mentality. Baaaaaaa. I'm just one of the sheeple.  I'm not bitter because I don't have a man. Or woman. I'm bitter because society has the ability to sometimes make me feel deficient for not having one. Not deficient enough to take whoever comes along, though. I'm bitter, not desperate.  And at least I won't be on the horns of the dilemma facing many Canadians with significant others this evening. I hear tonight is the first time since 1987 that Valentine's Day and Hockey Night in Canada coincide. Decisions, decisions.

      The stress of living with my family, after not living with my family for a year, is starting to get to me. My sister and brother yell at each other, my father is constantly asking me stuff like "how's the job search coming" and "how's the book coming" at the times I am most guaranteed not to want to talk about either, my mother with her perfectly polite and justifiable requests, "Would you be able to wash the dishes/vacuum/clean the bathroom, etc." Why is it that I have no trouble doing chores, seldom put them off, don't even really dislike doing them, when it's for myself in my own apartment? But when my mother asks me to do something, I just want to yell "No I can't." I think it must be what someone called "the perverseness of human nature." I really hate being irrational. I can feel my selfcontrol eroding when my family does things and all I can think of is I need to get away from here. Right now.  I am searching for another job. Korea here I come. Again. Hopefully by March.  I've been looking for a job since I got back to Canada in December. Hoping the job fairy would drop the perfect job in front of me. I am tired of trying to find the perfect job. I'd settle for any halfway decent one right about now. I thunk my head against the wall when I think about the job that I was offered at a high school that I turned down in December, thinking I'd find a better one and that I had plenty of time. So, I have given in and am dealing with a recruiter, who I have heard nothing about - though this could be good, not bad. She phoned tonight and was asking if I was interested in a job in Pohang working for Posco.  She asks me, "you know Posco?" Half question, half statement. "Um...no," I reply. "They are the biggest steel manufacturers in the world." she tells me. "Oh, right, Posco," I say, sensitive as always to the possible wound inflicted to her national pride by my not knowing this famous Korean company.  So far, in my diligent searching of the internet, I have found out this about Posco and Pohang. - it's a lot like Jecheon in that it sucks and is boring, except if you know how to make your own fun. Or really like drinking. - given that there is this gigantic plant making steel there, the air quality is *cough, hack, hack* not that great - Posco is a shitty place to work. Or so one person says other people have said. - Posco is a great place to work. Or so one person says. - Pohang has a close foreign community. Like Jecheon again, everyone knows everyone. Or more like, everyone drinks with everyone. - Pohang has a US army base, also sometimes sailors get leave there. - Pohang also has lots of, um...entertainment, for them. - Pohang is the armpit of Korea. (That's what they told me Jecheon was. Well, everyone's got two, I guess that includes countries.) - But, you can get cheddar cheese in Pohang. Yay, cheese!  None of the stuff I've heard really puts me off. Living in boring places with unpleasant climates is nothing new. Pollution is, but I read that Seoul is worse, and I could handle that. On a post I read, someone wrote about the bitterly unpleasant weather with -10 windchill. If that's as bitter as it gets, bring it on. A place is just a place - whether you like it, or get anything from it, that's all about what's in your head.  Incidentally, I wound up on a fair number of unrelated sites during my search. The strangest thing I pulled up? Ottmar Liebert's blog. How weird is that?

      This looks like it'll be a movie worth watching. Analysing the behavior of a corporation as a person leads to the conclusion that it's a psycopath. It's an interesting premise, anyways. And they interview a slew of interesting people, including  Noam Chomsky, Naomi Klein and Michael Moore. The clips I saw on the site seemed a bit overly dramatic and extreme in places, but it looked really interesting. That part about the nag study - advertisers studying children to determine how to teach them to nag their parents to buy things more effectively - now that's scary.

A person is said to be gawmless when his fingers are so cold and frozen that he has not the proper use of them. That would have been a pretty handy word to have last week. "Mom, I'm sorry I can't shovel the driveway but I'm totally gawmless."

I really hope that the last few things I washed are dry by the morning.  I'm a lot more apprehensive this time around. Maybe because I know that you just never know until you get there and see it. That it can be good, but it can also be really bad. I've been flipping from excited to nauseous all day. My mom was saying grace tonight at dinner and almost started crying. I really hate it when she cries because it always makes me want to cry too. She'll probably cry tomorrow when I say goodbye, and then I'll be crying in the airport (she's driving me there). And even though its normal and I don't think it's stupid or pathetic to cry when you leave and won't see someone you really love for a year, I'll still feel stupid and pathetic for doing it in public.  Why am I doing this? I seem to have forgotten.  I hope I remember soon, because otherwise this year is going to suck.

      Well, not right now. Though if the people in Korea had their way I'd be leaving tomorrow. I'm a pretty accommodating individual, but being told on Monday night that they want me to leave Wednesday...? I mean, I'm going to be gone for a year. Even if I'm all packed and everything, I still have things to do like wash clothes, clean out my room, visit the bank, say goodbye to my friends, gorge on ethnic foods unavailable in Korea.  We can look at this from their point of view, which would be - we told her that she would get here the second week in March, why does she want to wait longer?  Or from my point of view, which is - not hearing much, half feeling that they've changed their minds and I'll have to find a new job, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, then suddenly, GO NOW!   Did they stop to consider how hard it is to pack when you don't know what airline you're flying on and therefore don't know the luggage allowance?  Anyways, I'm trying to dipolmatically suggest that I'm not completely happy with this date and would prefer to leave on Monday. We shall see...

      Friday night I went to a fashion show at Tantra. The last time I was in that bar, it was still The Drink...it looks much better now, and has these great booths. Anyways, I was a bit apprehensive about going to a fashion show. I don't know fashion. My personal style leans to the student-denim-don't-notice-me-casual. Except in Korea, where it was more of a don't-notice-me-business-dress-casual-whatever-matches-all-the-time-therefore-too-much-black kind of style. So a fashion show is not exactly my normal milieu. Was there fashion show etiquette? A dress code? Will they even let me in? I wasn't sure what I'd be getting myself into. After all, this was the first time that I had been to one since junior high when all the students were tortured by being forced to model the clothes they made in home ec.  I can't say much has changed.  Sure the clothes are nicer, you're less likely to spot crooked seams and holes from across the room. But its still teenagers modeling the clothes. Though they have better makeup and hair. And the crowd is filled with people who are there not just to see what the clothes are like, but to judge. The models, the audience, everyone is on display.  While it may be a bit mean spirited to be making snide remarks about everyone, it sure is fun. I was unfortunate enough to be standing beside the modeling agent who was doing the announcing. Every so often he'd spit out a contextless phrase that you had to strain to hear over the pulsing bass. "Dolce and Gabanna...at Taantraaah...Name Dropping at Holt Renfrew...Taantrah...Holt Renfrew..." et cetera, ad nauseum, ad infinitum. This guy seriously needed to work on his delivery. And maybe his body too. He must have been 100lbs overweight. Doesn't that make working in the fashion world tough? Not to mention totally unfair - the female equivalent of this guy would never get anywhere. And it's gotta be a little harsh for all his waifish dieting models if they have lunch with him.  Who else was there to make fun of? Interchangeable models with blank faces, marching gracelessly down the runway. Though I felt kind of sorry for them. The prententious fashionistas decked out in clothes taken straight off a Holt Renfrew mannequin. The totally denim clad. The pack of teenage label whores, including one totally dressed in tight short white "J'adore Dior" who was a size too big for her clothes.  What's strange is that you assume these people, going to a fashion show and all, really care about clothes and style and fashion and all that. They care about their personal style and image. Except I saw plenty of what I thought were not very appealing or attractive statements being made. Yet I'm sure they all thought they looked great. Maybe they do. There are more things in heaven and earth...

      The auto show is coming to town. Yee. Haw.  I went down to read the newspaper this morning and discovered a fat glossy magazine advertising all the fat new automobiles out there. In between the excessive advertisements, they fit in some half page write ups on "feature vehicles". And what are the feature vehicles? Trucks, SUVs, luxury cars, sports cars. They manage to make room to talk about a few entry level vehicles, and there's a write up on the Prius as well. But mostly, its all about bigger, faster, shinier, pricier. Not much about fuel economy, emissions and safety. The ads have words like  power, big, luxury, torque, speed, class . Its all about drivers and owning the road. Who cares that there are things like speed limits and that we have to share the road? Consumers are like children. Or maybe magpies. (ooohh....shiny...) No wonder no one is selling cars for the "environmentally conscious, responsible, considerate driver". Even though I would say this is something we should all aspire to be.  I don't own a car. I often wish that I could manage to get by in life without ever owning a car. Taking decent public transit, taxis when necessary, walking. I did that in Korea for a year. And it was more convenient than living in the suburbs of Calgary ever is, even when I have access to a vehicle. Realistically, though, I know that I'll give in eventually and buy a car. But I really hope I won't be sucked in by all the crap that auto ads sell. A car gets you from point A to point B. And that is the whole point of it. If I can do it safely, use less gas, create less pollution and create fewer problems on busy roads, so much the better. Chrome I don't need. Or a stereo system that can vibrate windows from half a block away.  Thousands of people are going to flock to the auto show, looking at vehicles that are bigger and faster than their last. They'll salivate over cars that cost enough money to feed a village of people in Africa for a year. Maybe they'll even buy it. Or rent it, anyways. It may make you seem wealthier, but in reality you're poorer because you stupidly dropped a bunch of money you don't have on a car you can't afford. But it's a big fat very visible status symbol everyone can stare at. And sure, some people will think they're cooler, better, whatever. A car doesn't make you a better person. It doesn't make you smarter or more attractive.   As a friend of mine has said, "leasing a beemer won't make your dick any bigger".  But if you rode a bicycle to work in December, then I'd be impressed.

      In our basement, that is. Our hot water tank is pretty much dead, and was leaking water all over the floor. My brother was draining it, but he's gone to bed now, so I'm keeping an eye on it. Someone's coming to look at it tomorrow. We'll probably have to get a new one.  My parents are away on vacation right now - I drove them to the airport this morning. Seems like pretty suspicious timing to me. Ah, well, it's not like we can't handle it. Actually, it's probably good for me to get some experience dealing with the nasty things that can go wrong when you've got so many people around to pitch in. Home disasters with training wheels. This is the stuff they don't teach you about in school, but they really should. Home economics and industrial arts should have been about stuff like how to get a loan, buy a car, fix leaky pipes, detect gas leaks, clean your water heater. Instead I learned how to sew and cook, which I learned more and better at home, and how to take pictures, use a band saw, and make ceramics. Not that that isn't cool to do, it's just if it's going to be a requirement, they might try teaching you things you might to be required to use in real life.

      I was mucking around on the internet, and ran into these personals on the homepage for some newspaper. Every week, or day, whatever their rotation is, a few people who have signed up on their personals, who are sufficiently witty and attractive, earn the right to be one of their "featured" personals. Among other things these people write about themselves, they're obligated to share their "most embarrassing moment". Now one woman wrote, "anytime I have puked in public". I have to agree, yes, puking in public is definitely embarrassing. Another woman writes "Puking into my lap while onboard a tiny propeller plan in Botswana." I'm assuming she was in fact on a plane of some sort, and not standing on the plans for some African propeller. Now this could no doubt be equally as embarrassing as simply "puking in public", but I doubt it was this woman's most embarrassing moment. If something is going to be looked back on as your most embarrassing moment, the most intense feeling you get from it, the only feeling I really get from mine, is downright embarrassment. It isn't ameliorated by any positive feelings, other than the fact that it is over. This woman, I got the feeling, was proud of the fact that she wound up on any plane in Botswana, let alone a propeller plane. The fact that she puked was incidental, because now she gets to talk about how adventurous and well traveled she is, under the guise of laughing at herself. And it doesn't sound like the really embarrassing sort of "I drank too much" puking in public. More like the "there are serious extenuating circumstances such as food poisoning or horrible turbulence that would make James Bond himself keel over" puking in public. Which is not nearly as embarrassing, at least for me.  My most embarrassing moment, is of course, when I puked in public. I can only say that I'm glad it's over. If, one day in the future, I write up my own personal ad, it's certainly not going to say "walking out of a bathroom after vomiting, to discover my boss just down the hall, while I was working in Korea". Of course, if anyone who ever worked in Korea read that, it would certainly be a lot more understandable.  And how on Earth do these people manage to get up the nerve to post their photos and personals on the internet like that, and never bother to check their spelling? It seems like the equivalent of letting a stranger into your house when your dirty clothes are lying all over the floor.

      I think I'm one of the few people I know that could spend 36 hours straight in this apartment and not go completely mad. does it count if I spent most of it sleeping? Though another twelve might do me in. I just realized I haven't spoken a single word since Saturday afternoon when a friend called. I don't think I sounded my best. Oh, my poor family, I'm sure there were times they wished they could have experienced this amount of blissful silence from me.   Ahem... testing, testing, 1, 2, 3...  Yep, still works.

      Apparently, the reported death toll is sitting at 154 now, and that thousands were injured. This is all coming from outside sources though, North Korea is keeping pretty quiet and behaving secretively, as per usual. North Korea has restricted access to the site, but by the time about 40 international relief workers and reporters arrived on Saturday, there were no victims to be seen.  urlLink read more  I'd like to be optimistic, but I just can't help but think that they're hiding something, and wonder what that might be.

      I have finally taken the time to discover how to post pictures. Of course, at the moment that doesn't really do much good, since I have, um, 1 picture. But I may be buying a digital camera (when I have more than a hundred bucks to my name) and then, watch out! It'll probably only take me about another six months to figuring out  that . So, if anyone who doesn't already know me is reading this blog, and you're wondering who writes this crap, here it is. I probably owe both my jobs teaching English to this photo more than I do to my Linguistics degree.

      Did any other bloggers sign up to test it? This new free email service gives you 1 GB of storage. Except, of course, for the fact that some program scans your email for key words and then sends you advertising.  I did sign up for it, but you have to wonder at the legality of the thing. I've agreed that I don't care if my emails get read and I'm innundated with advertising, but the people that I may email have not agreed to have the emails they send me scanned.  I suppose by virtue of the fact that the email is sent at all, the writer gives consent for it to be read. Obviously assuming that the reader is going to be the person it is addressed to. The writer is vaguely aware they have no control over what happens once it is opened by the intended recipient - they couldn't stop the reader from printing a thousand copies and plastering them all over Olympic Plaza if they wanted. But there is often an implicit understanding on the writer's part that the content won't be shared. Does it matter? By merely offering that trust, does it become something like priviledged information between a lawyer or psychiatrist and a client? Or is it public as long as one party gives consent for it to be?  Anyways, you've been warned. If you feel like helping me test it, my new address is cheryl.hamilton@gmail.com.

      This is in response to the "Useless Things" post on  urlLink Rea and Jon's blog .  I have plenty of useless garbage producing disposable things. But probably the worst for trash production is something that most girls don't think much of. (Boys, you may want to skip to the next paragraph here.) That's right, tampons and pads. Just stop and consider how many you go through every single month, and how many times you do that in your life. I bet that it outweighs all the other 'disposables' that I chuck out combined. Not a very pleasant thought. But are you planning on switching to  urlLink the Keeper ? I know I'm not. And on similar lines, how many people are seriously considering using reuseable cloth diapers instead of disposable ones? Let's be honest.   People like the easy way. If there is a handy disposable item or something that works fast but guzzles tons of energy, the average person will use it, because they have no real immediate incentive not to. People are never going to stop buying convenient disposable trash producing items until it costs them more than they're worth.  But stop and think of the kind of stuff that generally goes into the trash, including all those convenience items (Exclude the odd occasional items like a broken VCR or pool table.) What is it? Paper, cans, potato peels, plastics, week old rice, old missing socks, cellophane, tampon applicators, used Kleenex, disposable razors. I don't know about you, but a hell of a lot of the refuse I produce can either be recycled, or is biodegradeable. Living, by myself, in Korea, I recycle most of my paper, cans, and bottles, and I throw out around 30 liters of garbage a month (so, 360L a year). And at least half of that is food stuff that's biodegradeable and little things I could still recycle but am too lazy to sort.  How the hell can you make people make less trash and recycle more? Make recycling and composting free and convenient. Get free door to door recycling service for everyone, mass produce some sort of recycling box (a recyclable one, of course) with clearly defined compartments that are easy for an idiot to figure out so that people sort it properly. (because that's half the problem). Most people don't have a clue about how or the space to compost, so make the pick up of organic trash free. Meanwhile, you give everyone an allowance of something like 500 Liters per year for the rest of their garbage, and then charge them for any in excess of this. Which I would say is totally possible, as I'd probably be throwing out under 200L a year if I recycled or composted everything I could. Including disposable razors and other things people prefer not to mention.  The real problem when it comes to garbage isn't the residential trash. It's not the extra packaging on your Mr.Noodles soup, the paper cup with the cardboard sleeve you get at Starbucks or the box for your Big Mac. It's what's produced when making them, by businesses and industry out of your sight. It's easy to think that you don't make much garbage when you don't realize the vast majority (I can't remember the number, but I think it's over 80%) of the waste from the products you use is already in the dump before you even get them into your house. And sure, this includes the disposable plastic razors and swiffer cloths. There's plenty of garbage created at whatever restaurant you ate at that you don't ever see. But it's also the big items, the things you don't consider disposable at all (a car, a computer, a new water heater) that generate a truely huge amount of waste in their production.   And isn't it interesting to know that "compost" "composting" and "biodegradeable" aren't in the spell check, but it made sure I capitalized "Kleenex"? So please, forgive me if I misspelled them.

      The field trip today went pretty well. We visited some sort of botanical gardens, where they also have a learning center with all sorts of dead insects, trees and animals immortalized for people to take pictures of. It was picturesque, what with the flowers and trees blooming and butterflys all over the place. It was freaking busy too, they were dozens of different classes walking around the place. Just before we left, one class of what looked like four hundred middle school girls walked in. As i watched them walk by, I wondered how the very few adults could keep track of them all and not lose a few. Then I realized how silly that was, since they're all wearing the same bloody uniform, so there's no way a kid can wander off and get lost in another crowd of equally boring yet totally different uniforms. Anyways, it seemed like a long day for a bunch of 4 and 5 year olds, but the kids did okay and were well behaved. There was one incident with a frog, though...  As far as a learning opportunity went, well, I imagine the students learned a few things, such as how to tell how old a tree is, and a few English names for the dead, stuffed animals they saw in glass cases. But, other than that, it seemed the primary reason for the excursion was a photo opportunity.  Now, I'm not saying that you shouldn''t take pictures of students to immortalize the special learning opportunities the school provides so that parents can see them an dbrag to their friends. But I'd really like to know, why I was blessed with the priviledge of holding every single kid for an individual photo op, when none of the Korean teachers were? I spent more time with those kids today (4 hours) than I have in the past two weeks. Their Korean teachers spend that much time with them every day. I felt a little awkward about it - especially since I can't really communicate well with the other teachers. Did they feel a little slighted? Because I felt that way for them. Of course, there were quite a few group photos. Only one of which I managed to escape, when I just took the camera and put the other teacher in the photo without trying to ask. After that they didn't let me hold the camera.  I know that foreign teachers are as much about advertising as about education. Still, I think it might be nice for the kids to have a picture of them with their real teacher, the one they're going to recall clearly and with affection, as opposed to that vaguely remembered person who taught them a few words of English.

      For some reason the internet is slow as molasses this morning.  Did you notice I said morning? As in, before noon. Amazing though it is, I managed to make it out of bed shortly before 8. That's like a regular person getting up at 4. What event has precipitated me hauling my ass out of bed at what most people would call a reasonable hour? I get to go on a field trip with the kindy kids today.  I hope I come back in one piece.

      The following post contains me whining and complaining about my actually quite decent life. The following post contains foul language. The following post is certainly not an example of well written English prose. If any of these things offend you, so fucking what? Am I forcing you to read it?  I am not well pleased with my school at the moment. I've now been enlisted to do something called 'phone teaching'. It basically consists of calling up my students, asking them a couple questions, and dragging the answers (in complete sentences) out of them. If it all ran like clockwork, I'd be done one call in one minute. And I only have twenty or so students I'm supposed to do this with, so it's not like it takes a lot of time. That said,  IT IS THE BIGGEST FUCKING TIME WASTING ACTIVITY EVER  These people are nuts. Why do we do this? And why the hell am I the one doing it? Cause let me tell you, it ain't too easy for me to communicate to the Korean only speaking person that answers the phone with my nonexistent Korean that I want to speak to their son Jack - which is his English name, which the parents probably don't know. Do you mean Song-de? How the hell should I know? Everything is so bloody disorganized it takes ten minutes for me to figure out the English names that go with the Korean names. And then ten minutes later when I finally do get the kid on the phone, it takes under two minutes even with the slowest to get through what I'm supposed to do. Whatever that time we spend on the phone is, it isn't teaching, it isn't productive, its just a big fucking pain in the ass for the kid, the people trying to understand my shitty Korean, and for me.  And let me just go on, for a moment, about the complete and utter disorganization that I walked into at this school. A certain amount is fine, I can handle, I can fix it. If given a little goddamn time and assitance. I started teaching these classes with no info on them, barely knowing what book they're using, some of them using no book. For some of the classes I got stuck picking a book for after I saw them once or twice. Other than the classes I picked a book for, it isn't like the books used at this school come with any supplementary information or teaching assistance. That I can read, anyways. I suppose I should be grateful there aren't often mistakes in them.  And then there was the complete absence of files for these classes. Other than a few student info sheets that the first Korean teacher had and never bothered to share with me, there was nothing. What have they done? What haven't they done? Who the hell knows or cares, I guess, as long as the parents keep paying.  As soon as I started, I knew I'd need to make files for the classes, if only for myself so I could know what was going on from class to class. But I couldn't even get my hands on empty file folders until today.  I finally got files set up for my classes today - and it was bloody great to be able to grab a file and see what was happening, instead of rifling through my stacks of loose paper that start out organized but are a mess within a few minutes.   Then there's the fact that I have a desk on the fifth floor, where the kindy program is, but no desk and hardly any space at all on the 4th floor, where I teach elementary and middle school kids, so I end up hauling shit up and down between floors all the time, and sometimes home because its too much aggravation to get someone to unlock the 5th floor at the end of the night or unlock the 4th at the beginning of the day.  None of this is a really big deal. It's just all these little minor irritations. It doesn't really bother me all that much generally. Really. Usually I cope very well, but I'm just in a nasty mood at the moment due to the stupid goddamn phone teaching. Cause I didn't get to leave until after 8, instead of at 7:30. (Oh, my life is so difficult...)  Actually, other than the phone teaching (and it isn't hard to do, just a waste of time and energy), today was a good day. The students were well behaved, they were fun, or cute or interested (depending on their ages).  Some of the middle school boys I teach (really great, fun students) have taken to calling me Calgary outside of class - possibly because it's easier to say than my name? They always stumble over the 'ryl' part. I don't know if this nickname is a good thing or a bad thing. But at least they don't call me Mouse, which is what the English grammar teacher gets.

      My schedule right now is still up in the air. Things seem to constantly be changing. It doesn't help that the Korean teacher I co-teach elementary with is newer than I am, and that the Kindergarten program is only a month older. Or that no foreign teacher has ever worked here, and the program is a lot more conducive to translation, which I don't really do efficiently. The books I use for the elementary kids completely suck. And when I suggested using different ones, they didn't really like it. Sometimes people run up to me to say that I've got a class with a pack of middle school kids that started ten minutes ago, but I didn't know because no one bothered to tell me. So sorry. And that they have no text book. I can't say I'm a fantastic teacher, but I've become pretty adept in the past three weeks at throwing together a lesson that requires not much more than a white board, markers, and a blank sheet of paper and pen for each student.  When I agreed to teach at this school, I was expecting disorganization and communication problems and things like being told I have a class five minutes ago. The reason I signed on was because the pay was pretty decent, and the schedule is Monday to Thursday. I have no Friday classes, so every weekend is a long weekend, and this weekend was potentially extra long.  Tomorrow is election day in Korea. It is a national holiday. I get all national holidays off. Ergo, I get Thursday off. Yes? Actually, no. My two evening middle school classes are still on as per usual. Good bye long weekend.  Today, in between classes (one ends at 6, the other starts at 6) my Korean co teacher tried to explain to me that I have to come on Friday as well. Excuse me? It seems that one of my middle school students is doing some sort of test or competition thing on the internet, and I have to hold her hand while she does it. I mentioned to my partner that this seemed unnecessary and a little unfair and like cheating. She promptly communicated this information to the director, who said that, well, its okay, because everyone will be doing it. Far be it from me to interfere with Korean tradition.  So, it seems not only is my weekend not extra long, it isn't long at all. I'm not really angry about it though. It's not like I have a brisk social life happening, and it won't take much time. And I wouldn't argue even if I was angry, not in my first few weeks, not before I've even been paid. I believe you have to give a little to get a little, and I can't always expect everything to run according to my supposed schedule. It would be a little nasty to get pissed because I've gotta spend what'll come down to probably less than a half hour that I basically only have to show up for. For all that it sometimes seems ESL teaching in Korea is just a different kind of McJob, I get a salary, not an hourly wage. It's more responsibility than just showing up for my shift every day. Though sometimes not much more.  This better not set any kind of a precedent, though. I signed up in good faith for a position that was Mon-Thu. If they start scheduling classes for me on Friday, then I'll be pissed.

      There are always two sides to every story. Or maybe even three or more. Here's  urlLink one .  I wouldn't be too impressed with whoever ran my city if they couldn't get the freaking traffic lights to work for an entire year. I'm imagining what the 45 minute commute from Sundance to the U of C would be like with construction or an accident at every major intersection on the way. It would take like four hours to get there. I know a year of that would piss me off. God, a  week  of that would have me doing something irrational and violent.

      I went out for dinner after work tonight with my Korean co-teacher. She took me over to Chungbuk University, which it turns out isn't too far from where I live. She seemed really surprised that I didn't know where it was, and hadn't been there before. As soon as we got there, I figured it out. It was like 17th ave, 10th ave and the university all rolled into one. With maybe a bit of Kensington dumped in for good measure. Of course this is where the foreigners come. It's where all the bars are. And students. And possibly more English speaking Koreans. And hot female university students (English optional) for male foreigners to pick up.  After we ate, we walked around a bit. I noticed all these flyers littering the ground. Were they for plays, concerts, festivals, I wondered? Then two guys stopped us, shoved a flyer into my friends hand. We looked at it, and I could have sworn it advertised a movie or something. Then the guy says something like, "Best bar, best drink, you come in." Ahhhh. So that's what all this stuff is. This happened a couple of times. The last guy we met who gave us one made an extra effort to try out his English on me. "Drink here is best. I service you. I service you good."  Sometimes its probably better that I'm the only one that gets the joke.

      My very good friends from Jecheon came up and stayed with me this weekend. I smoked a hell of a lot and drank too, neither of which I've done since being in Korea. (Shocking, I know, isn't it?) We were at Dream Plus today shopping. We headed over to Lotte Mart and put their bags in the lockers there. When we went back later on to get them, there was this guy putting his dog in one of the lockers. What the fuck? First of all, who brings their dog shopping? Second, who thinks its a great idea to put it in a locker? Well, I guess if you're stupid enough to think taking a dog to the mall is a good idea, then you're dumb enough to try to stuff said dog in a locker like a faux Chanel handbag.  Besides seeing the dog in the locker, I did catch a glimpse of a few foreigners today, and said hi to one (after almost running into him). But I still haven't met any. I will definitely have to make an effort if I want a social life. But I'm not quite desperate enough yet that I'll force myself to get over my whole how-the-hell-do-I-approach-a-stranger awkwardness.  I also bought a shirt. Which is pink. It's kind of scary. I haven't owned a pink anything since elementary.

      Oh God I wish I was dead. Well, not really. Maybe just a boy, instead. I have the most vicious cramps right now. People who don't get them don't understand how they can make it almost impossible to function. Like its perfectly normal and I must be a wimp for complaining. (I'm really not a wimp, I just want some sympathy. Please?) My mother always tells me all I need to do is go for a walk, or do something, and they'll get better. Maybe with mild ones that works but not with these. They go into my back and right down to my knees so I can hardly walk and all I want to do is curl up in a ball. And this is after I take four or six advil. The really bad ones only last half a day though, and after that they're a lot more managable. I sometimes think of it as being in training for if I ever have kids. Except, how much more would that hurt? At least I got them today, and not when I was working. And I've discovered that my laptop does a good job as a heating pad.

      Russell Crowe is making a movie in Toronto and some US government types are apparently  urlLink pissed . Is it really the job of Congress to write nasty letters complaining about shooting movies in Canada?    Watson went on to note how so-called runaway productions have cost the U.S. economy tens of thousands of jobs and billions in lost revenue. She said films like Chicago, which was also shot in Toronto, are "stark examples of placing profits over American jobs... we hope ... studios will take into account the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs to foreign labour forces by refusing to participate in the further outsourcing." Hello? This is the goal of the capitalist economy. You place profits above pretty much fucking everything. American corporations have been outsourcing jobs for decades. But I guess getting millions of Mexicans to make your cars and South East Asians to make your clothes is so much more okay than getting a few thousand Canadians to make your movies.  I wonder if any of the congresspeople who signed that stupid petition care that some Canadian government types are getting ready to fork over money (and jobs) to the American film industry. And, of course, there's some people  urlLink complaining  about that too.   Stop trying to fuck with the whole free trade thing you started, because your actions are ineffectual and only make it worse. Stop whinging, suck it up and take it like a real capitalist, everyone. And as for the Canadian government's attempt to help the film industry - same goes. As if anyone there has the judgement to figure out what money should be spent on, anyways. I haven't forgotten about  urlLink art  like the hanging refridgerator full of semen or dead rabbit carcasses. I'm not really old enough to remember the stink over the meat dress.

      Forgive me for commenting on news that is a bit old, but I've been out of the loop for the past couple weeks.  Anyways, I noticed  urlLink this  today. At first I thought this was a really great idea, but then I thought about it for a second and realized that, no, it's mostly stupid and a waste of money.  There are tons of people out there who are shitty drivers, and on any average driving day they would lose their license for the millions of things they do wrong. But.  They got their license by passing the stupid test. Most of them know how they should be driving. They just don't do it. Take me, for example. I speed. I drive with one hand on the wheel. I fiddle with the radio and don't pay complete attention to the road. I don't always signal properly.  It's such a godawful mentality to have - that testing people makes them better or smarter. It doesn't. It only ensures that someone knows all the right answers on that particular day.  Re-testing people would hardly have any affect on driving conditions, other than aggravating the million drivers on the road because they have to waste their time getting re-tested. Maybe a few people would fail, but you know, they'll figure out how to pass the test again soon enough. And then they'll just go back to their regular habits.  If someone really wants to help make driving safer, you've got to change attitudes. There's this attitude that it doesn't matter if I come to a complete stop, or speed, or make an illegal turn this one time. That driving is something you can do casually, with half your attention on your phone conversation, or the radio, or the argument with your kids. That it's okay to get in the car after two drinks because it doesn't affect you that much. These are things that you can't really punish with tickets, and you can't stop with more testing. Somehow, its become acceptable to not follow rules totally. If you come to a complete and total stop at ever single stop sign it almost makes you, well, dumb. Because you don't really need to follow the all rules. They're more like guidelines. When social disapproval accompanies any action that even slightly increases the potential danger to other people's safety, if we all tell our friend Chris, or Uncle Bob or whoever that he's an idiot when he does 35 instead of 30 in a playground zone, or drives after drinking a few beer, or talks on his cel in the car...that's when there'll be fewer accidents.   But no amount of testing and re-testing will help. Except if the government is looking for a little extra cash.

      I live in Kaeshin-dong in Cheongju. I haven't yet figured out what kind of neighborhood this is in the scheme of things. There aren't really many bars, but there are some restaurants, and there's a few nice looking clothes stores, a flower/plant shop and a couple of very nice antique-ish looking furniture stores on one street near my house. There's an apartment complex going up nearby, which someone pointed out and said was the most expensive one in Cheongju.  The few streets closest to me are filled with smaller apartments, most of them three or four floors I think, many with some sort of store on the bottom floor. Almost all these buildings look like brick, or granite or stone. Nice neutral browns and grays, anyways. Except mine. I have christened it 'the lego building' as its sides are done in big squares of white, red and blue. And maybe some yellow thrown in too. But I don't have to look at the outside while I'm inside, and it makes it easy for me to remember where I live.  As for my apartment, well, I'll try to describe it. Keep in mind I suck at spatial relations, so I may be off by a couple feet everywhere.  My apartment has four rooms. Though, dignifying two with the appellation 'room' is a bit much.  There is a space about 5 by seven feet which is the kitchen/entry area. The kitchen is a sink and range (it has two burners and is hooked up to a gas line). There is no counter space. There is a bathroom which consists of a sink, toilet, and shower nozzle. Notice I didn't say shower stall, because the entire bathroom is the shower. I have yet to figure out the exact angle required to keep from spraying the door and consequently getting my floor outside the bathroom wet. The kitchen and bathroom are along one side of the main room. The main room, which is the entire apartment pretty much, is about 12 by 12 feet.  This room serves as the dining room, living room, bedroom, computer room, entertainment room, and pretty much whatever other rooms with fancy names you have in your house.  Then, opposite the kitchen and bathroom, running along the entire side of the main room, is another room about 3-4 feet wide. This is the laundry room. I have a washing machine, and there's this thing that comes down from the ceiling with four parallel bars that you can hang your clothes on to dry.   So, good things about this place compared to the last one - it's closer to stuff, like a grocery store, 7/11, restaurants, work; everything I need is ten minutes away. I like not having to take an elevator up or down ten floors every time I want to go somewhere. Bad things -  well, there's no view. Last time one wall of my apartment was all glass doors and I had an okay view from the tenth floor. Here my windows are smaller and all I can see is an alley and the building beside me. And the kitchen is small, and the fridge is tiny (like a bar fridge).  It doesn't have a separate freezer, and the freezing area is too short to keep anything like ice cream in it.  But on the whole, it's decent, and better than a lot, and it's everything I need. And I guess when I want ice cream, I'll just have to walk to Baskin Robbins. Or eat the entire carton.

      So, the phone woke me up this morning around 10:30. I am not at my best in the morning, and certainly not up for the difficulties of translating from a language I don't know to a language the other person doesn't know. I don't like to talk even in English for at least ten minutes after I get up. My family could tell you that usually I only grunt or say don't talk to me until after I have a shower and breakfast. Anyways, the conversation went something like this.   Me -"Hello?" with groggy croaky morning voice. Guy - "Yoboseyo?" Probably couldn't understand what I was saying, let alone the language. "Hi." Are we going to do the Hello-Yoboseyo-Hello-Yoboseyo dance for a few minutes before he hangs up? "Uh....hello." As in, oh shit, its a wayguk, what the hell do I say, what English can I remember... "Hello" "Uh...KT Telecom." "Yes?" "Uh...I go here now." "Yes?"  And so it went, with some confusion, and me trying to be encouraging as the KT telecom guy took pity on me and tried to explain himself in English. Which he did well enough for me to realize, oh shit, he's coming over right now, and I'm in my pajamas, which are not suitable for public consumption, and I better get some clothes on fast.  About thirty seconds after I had dragged my jeans and a shirt on, the guy came to my door, and, hooray! About half an hour later he left and I had the internet. So I am connected now. Ahssah-bi! No more dirty smoky crowded PC bahngs filled with the incessant drone of fifteen different games and two 8 year olds reading over my shoulder for me no thank you.  To celebrate, I pulled up CJAY 92 on the internet and listened to the top eight at eight while I had my shower. Stupid little things that you don't care about at home, but really appreciate when you aren't.

      Hey, so here I am, in Cheongju. Things seem to be okay, I now have a telephone (yay!), still no internet or cable hookup, getting that next week.  Funny thing - all my anxiety seemed to dissappear once the airplane landed in Incheon. So, as much as I hate to think so, I guess I must have a little bit of a fear of flying. Or maybe its the airplane food. Or fear of lost baggage. Or customs. Nasty flight attendants. A person with smelly feet in the seat beside you. So many things to not like about flying that don't even include crashing.  I have yet to make it downtown. There's a fair amount of stuff in my neighborhood, and then there's this shopping center called "Dream Plus" not too far away. I went over there today to go to the Lotte mart in search of cheese. Alas, only the horribly bland and rubbery pizza cheese was available. Oh, and some cheddar that came in a 2kg block. Oh well, I really shouldn't eat cheese anyway.  I have not yet managed to connect with any other foreign English speaking types. I saw one from the back the day I was in the Cheongju immigration office. And today I saw a guy walking by the mall. But I didn't really feel like accosting him in the middle of a sidewalk with his korean girlfriend in tow, particularly since they looked as though they were going somewhere. If they had been sitting down, now that would have been a different story. I have found a Subway, Pizza Hut, and two Baskin Robbins so far. For now, I guess ice cream and pizza will have to make up for the lack of conversation.

      ...and that's all I have to say about work today.  Thankfully a friend called after work, we went for a walk and he let me vent a bit at him. Poor guy.  Incidentally, we walked by a few parks while we were roaming about the area, and went on the swings and the teeter totters in one. I forgot how much fun those kinds of things could be. Now I know where I'm heading next time I feel like throwing or hitting something.

      I am, was, a big Buffy fan. I never hung out on internet message boards, or taped every single episode and bought the complete collection of DVDs, but if I was home and it was on TV, I was watching it. I guess I couldn't consider myself that huge a fan since I've not seen most of the final season, or the series finale. But I like the show, and I was thrilled last year when I discovered a channel that broadcast the series in Korea.  I'm seriously torn between thinking that  urlLink this  academic conference on the series is really interesting, and thinking that it's the saddest waste of time ever.  No matter how much you like it, or how great it is, or how much you think it can tell you about the human psyche, it seems a little extreme, a waste of time and intellectual resources, to devote your life to studying the show. A conference on Buffy studies? What do you talk about? Deconstructing archetypes: demons, witches and the supergeek? Slaying 101? Intermediate werewolf mythology? Vampire habitats and eating preferences?  But then I stop and think, well, what makes studying Dickens or Shakespeare more worthwhile an occupation than studying Buffy? Shakespeare was popular entertainment in his time, so was Dickens. Now we have Joss Whedon and Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It seems perfectly acceptable, though boring, to spend hours talking about Hamlet and why he was so indecisive. Why not talk about Buffy's ambivalence towards her duties as the chosen one instead? If I could write a really boring paper on Lady Macbeth for school, shouldn't I be allowed to write a paper on dark Willow? Either you can't take any of it seriously, none of it has any worth, or, you take all of it seriously, it all has value.  Still, I don't think I'm going to run out and buy Jana Riess' book, "What Would Buffy Do? A Vampire Slayer as Spiritual Guide."   What do you think?

      Note to self: when planning on playing pool, dancing for four hours, and playing pool again, remember that heels are not the most comfortable or practical footwear.  Hey, I saw Korean rappers tonight! I have no idea what the hell they were saying. But everyone was bopping their heads and putting their "motherfucking hands up" in the air. So they must have liked it.  It's kind of amusing to hear all these Koreans swearing in English, you wonder if they appreciate exactly what they are saying...

      I was wandering around Willmart (my local grocery store) the other day, and was truly shocked to discover Parmesan cheese and Cheez Whiz. Not just any generic crap mind you, this had the Kraft label on it. And this is a small time grocery store, it isn't like Carrefour or Shinsegae.  How much will a Cheez Whiz fix cost you here? Around 3 or 4 bucks for a tiny jar of about 150ml. And about the same for 85g of Parmesan.  The taste of home don't come cheap.

      currently listening to: The Vines - Get Free currently eating: seaweed currently drinking: water  I have all these little irritations cropping up in my life lately. I fell the other day, and put a hole in my jeans. Which doesn't really matter, at home, where there's a Gap in every mall. But I really can't find clothes here that fit me properly. And my light in my bathroom burned out. Which is not a problem, except I don't have the slightest clue how to remove the odd looking light fixture, and even if I did, I can't because I'm too short to reach it and there isn't a chair or stool to be had in my house. And you already know my phone is broken. Which is not a problem, except the closest place I can get one isn't within walking distance, and I'm too lazy to make the trip. And now it seems that the drain for my washing machine is slightly blocked up, because it overflowed onto the floor yesterday. That's really a pain in the ass, mopping up water at 1 am. Any advice? I'm contemplating dumping some draino type stuff down it. Is this a bad idea?  Other tiny irritations occurring in my life at the moment include a co-worker, a stupid curriculum, an absence of colored paper for making flashcards, disappearing pens, vanishing caps for the white board markers, and one particular seriously apathetic and disrespectful student. As well as a mosquito bite right on that bony part on the top of my foot that is driving me nuts. Any little things driving you nuts lately?

      (not realted to this post at all, but I really love the Strokes)   Okay, so it's Sunday, around 2 pm here. I am still feeling slightly unsteady from last night. Actually, I think I'm still drunk. I was out with people until the sun came up. It was, as it always is, a good time. But I have to say two things:  Why do some boys assume that just because you're nice and talk to them it means you want to sleep with them?  and  If you allow some drunk friend to crash at your place, isn't it just courtesy for them to let you know and say goodbye when they leave? So you can at least lock the door behind them?  and  Why are boys so weird?  Okay, so that was three things then, but I'm sure you'll all forgive me for my inability to count, it was a very late night.

      I just told my family about this blog. Just, as in, within the last few minutes I sent out some emails. So I imagine people will be trickling in slowly, depending on how often they read their email. And I only told my parents and my aunts. But I'm sure they'll share this information with everyone. Or maybe not at all. I mean, I know I'm interesting to me, but lots of people don't feel the same way.  But to those who make it, and actually stay long enough to read something, Hi guys!  Sorry it took so long. I figured it was about time, since that was sort of the reason I meant to start this in the first place.  The strange thing is that I wasn't even drinking or anything when it occurred to me that this would be an excellent thing to do. Hmm... is this a sign that I'm growing up, that I'm not hiding stuff from my parents anymore?

      My phone is broken. It broke sometimes between Monday night and Tuesday night. I can't call anyone. No one can call me. But that's okay - at least I can tell myself that people want to call me, and are calling me at this very second, only I can't hear them.  The past couple of days, when I've needed to use a phone, I've had to make a five minute trek to the nearest phone box to make a call. The first time I went, it took me twenty minutes to find a phone, and then the one I found didn't work, so I had to find another. (Someone had jammed some 500 won coins in it, so you couldn't put any money in to make a call. Why would they do that?) But I discovered a closer one today, so I'm much happier. (Don't ask me why I've started calling it a box, not a booth. It's a dialectal variation I've heard from someone here, and I just like it better than booth. So I'm using it.)  I don't have a cel phone. I occasionally feel like one of the last holdouts. Everyone seems to have one. I have never owned one. I was talking to someone about dating lately, she said that that first call is always a really difficult thing to do. I agreed. But then I thought about it a little more, and realized that calling anyone I'm not good friends with and have spoken to on the phone at least a few times feels just about the same. Maybe because I have never been a fan of the phone. For me, I generally use the phone to make plans. "Hi, we're meeting at six okay bye." These are my preferred types of conversations. I think some people think I might be rude, but I'm not really. I just feel a little uncomfortable on the phone. (I think half the reason I might not be comfortable with them is that my mom had this habit sometimes when I was young of not letting me use the phone if I could walk over to someone's house and talk to them face to face. Phones were for important things, or for calling people who lived far away.)  I think I may be getting over my aversion soon, giving in and buying a cel phone. There are too many people and places here, and I am never home. When I'm with Koreans, I can finally return the favor and have five or ten minute phone conversations with other people, while ignoring them completely. I can be one of the important people, always with something crucial to say to someone. I can take pictures of myself with the phone's camera on the bus, and check my makeup in the photograph. And it's great for getting a friend to give the taxi driver directions when he can't understand you.  The biggest benefit of this whole annoyance is that I explored the large apartment complex near my place. I thought it was just a series of apartment buildings, nothing interesting, but it's really nicely landscaped (for a Korean apartment complex) and there's some stores and things. Also, there were street vendors there yesterday when I went by, and one of them was making this thing called ho-ddeok (I think that's what its called). They take a ball of dough, put cinnamon and sugar inside it, then smoosh it flat and fry it on a grill. Those things are seriously tasty.

      Once upon a time I went to school and managed to get a degree in linguistics without really knowing half of what I should. For some reason, this morning I woke up with a stupid poem I wrote once while I was supposed to be writing a paper for my syntax class on logical form stuck in my head. So, a syntax haiku:  Who does everyone bind, co-index, dominate? Logical form sucks.  Other than adhering to the 5-7-5 syllable guide, I'm not sure it could really be called a haiku. Though if you know anything about logical form, then it is just a little bit clever. Actually, I don't remember much about logical form anymore. Or most of the advanced syntactic or phonological theory. I can probably remember more about what Noam Chomsky thinks about politics than I can about generative grammar. Which isn't much either way. My education has surely been put to excellent use, hasn't it?  If anyone out there is considering a degree in Linguistics, here is my advice: Do you want to be a speech/language pathologist? Do you want go into translation? Do you want to be a linguistics professor? Do you want to teach ESL?  If you answered no to all of these, maybe linguistics is not for you. If I had it to do again, I'd get a minor in it, and major in something more useful, like philosophy or history.

      It occurred to me that I never elaborated on the whole I met some foreigners today comment I made a few weeks ago.  One day three weeks ago, I was walking home from work in the early afternoon, when I saw this other person exit a store and start to cross the street in front of me. I stared for a second, then realized, "Holy shit, it's a white girl! I bet she speaks English." All my pre-thought out ways of how to introduce myself to a stranger completely vanished. "Hi!" I yell, and then realize I sound exactly like the Korean kids that constantly yell things like hihowareyouimfine! every time they see a white face. I'm sure she did think that, but she turned around anyways.  So I attacked her in the middle of the street and forced her to bring me out for dinner, and then for drinks afterwards. And she introduced me to many, many people. I even introduced myself to a few. And I now have something that could almost be called a social life.  It's amazing really, there's quite a few foreigners hanging about this area of town, one lives right across the street from me. But I have slightly odd hours, 12-9 usually, and most people start later in the afternoon, maybe 3 or 4, and finish earlier or later than me. So we don't generally run into each other unless its intentional.  I must say, of all the people I could have met, I'm really glad I bumped into this girl. She has got to be one of the nicest people I've met.

      I was walking through my neighborhood this morning on my way to school when I heard that ubiquitous Korean hack that precedes a volley of spitting. I turned in the direction of it (I don't know why) and noticed an older, reasonably well off looking gentleman standing beside one of the villas. He was staring at me. And spitting. Now, people here stare and spit pretty damn often, though not necessarily at the same time. But as I walked past, he turned so he could keep staring at me, and kept spitting. It was a distinctly malevolent kind of glare, and I swear he tried to spit louder so that I would be sure to notice him standing there. I wonder what was running through his head at that moment, he certainly wasn't thinking very kind thoughts about me.  This is the first time that I've really felt that kind of antimosity from anyone in Korea. Did he think I was American? Russian? I wonder, in his mind, which would be worse?  Of course, maybe he just ate some really bad kimchi, or he was constipated or something.

      Koreans seem to feel pretty comfortable passing comment on another person's physical appearance, whether positive or negative.  The kids point out the dark circles under my eyes, they pet my arms and pull at the hair saying "tul," which I think means fur. Oh great. The kindy students have also made comments about the size of my breasts, one of them pointed to them the other day, I'm not quite sure what she was trying to say. Her parents must have seen me and said something, because I could have sworn she pointed to each and said "C, C". D, actually, but good try. And every time I get a pimple, there's no point in trying to hide it, because someone is going to see it and say something like "Wow, you have a really big zit". Like I hadn't noticed.  Today I got a decent complement, I was wearing some jeans I've never worn to work before, and one of the teachers told me I looked slender. And sometimes I get, "you're beautiful". Often followed by, "you look tired". Actually, I've been told I'm beautiful by an astonishing number of taxi drivers in this country. I hope that wasn't the lead in to "are you Russian?" and "how much for one hour?"  But the winner of the most backhanded complement would have to be the one I got when I went back to Jecheon and saw people I hadn't seen in a while. I guess I'd lost a bit of weight, but not a hell of a lot, and I had a different haircut. And someone told me "Wow, you've lost weight, you look normal now." Jeez, thanks, man.  Nowhere near normal enough, because there still isn't much hope for me to find a pair of pants in this city that look nice and still fit my hips.  Anyone else gotten any interesting compliments lately?

      Don't you just hate it when you go to wash your hands in the bathroom, only you've forgotten to change the water flow from the shower to the tap, so when you turn on the water, you get all wet.  Does this happen anywhere outside Korea?

      Hmm, I forgot to mention that not long after I got out of the shower, after the gas lady had left, someone else came knocking on my door. With information for me to read probably vital to the saving of my soul.  Sorry, ladies, Hangukmal moteyo. (I don't speak Korean)  It's so much easier than being polite while listening to someone try to convince you that you really should join up so that you can go to heaven. Religion pushers are worse than drug pushers, no one ever goes door to door selling pot, do they? And didn't someone once say that religion is the opiate of the masses?  (Oh, was it was Stalin? Maybe I don't want to go around quoting that guy.)

      The other night, I went out for dinner with a friend. We wandered into this random restaurant, and ordered something called He-jang-guk, we only knew enough to know that it was some sort of soup involving seafood. It was actually very tasty, lots of fish and beansprouts and just enough peppers to give it a kick, not your typical spiced to the max heavy duty broth with the oil slick on top.  When the ajumma brought it to the table, she took pity on the clueless foreign types and showed us how to go about eating it, talking to us in Korean. The one thing she did say that we could understand was "diet food." Hmmm....  Later in the meal, noticing that we hadn't touched our rice, she came over again and opened them up (the rice bowl are metal and have lids) to show us that, hey, there's rice in here. But neither of us really wanted to eat it. And she started talking to us, probably the way any mother would scold their kid, "You know you have to eat your rice or you're going to get sick," or something along those lines.  Anyways, I felt so guilty that I ate half of it.

      I had just woke up, and was about ten seconds from my shower when this loud banging and repeated ringing of my doorbell starts, accompanied by some indecipherable Korean.  I quickly threw on my robe, opened the door, and there's this woman standing there holding a clipboard and a couple of strange things that looked like hand held radios. "Blah blah blah blah blah" she says to me. "Pardon?" says I "Gas. Gassssss." And she gently shoves her past me, barrels into the apartment, walks straight to the water heater, waves her little grey box around it, then goes back to the kitchen and repeats the procedure with the stove. Ah, I clue in finally, she must be checking to make sure there's no gas leaks. "Blah blah blah. Sign." she asks So I sign this little thing, who knows what I was agreeing to. "Is it okay?" I ask her" "Gwen-cha-ne-yo" she tells me, and leaves.  So, in case you were worried, I'm not going to blow up anytime soon.  I'm really glad that my apartment was reasonably neat and there wasn't any dirty underwear or three weeks worth of dirty dishes lying about.  I'm also glad it was a woman, not a man that came to check it. There's something a bit intimidating about having a strange person you can't communicate with in your apartment when you're only wearing a robe.  But did she really have to ring the doorbell six or seven times in a row without pausing to wait for me to answer? It really isn't the most pleasant sound.

      I was in Jecheon this weekend, to visit some friends. One was having a birthday, so everyone went out on Saturday night to celebrate by getting trashed. (I can see you all know where this is going...)  As a matter of fact, I was really well behaved, and had maybe only four drinks over the course of the night. By the time we began splitting up and heading home, I was pretty much stone sober, and not feeling the quite the thing. It was maybe three o'clock when six of us decided to go out for Samgyupsal (Korean barbeque). By the time we made it into the restaurant, sat down, and had the food on the table, our little group had lost two people. It's really amazing how you can walk just two blocks, cross a street, and suddenly discover that one person is missing.  Anyways, there ended up being four of us, sitting around the table, chatting and eating. At first I nibbled a bit, but I felt progressively worse until after a while I could barely stand the smell of the meat or the sight of it. I finally gave in and dragged the friend I was staying with out of there (or maybe she dragged me), and we started the short walk back to her place. As we were walking along the street, I thought, maybe I can make it all the way back to her house, it isn't really that far. Maybe. Possibly. Even though it feels like my stomach is climbing into my throat. Then, about two blocks away, I finally had to give in to my heaving stomach and, well, heave. So I did my part to add to the Saturday night street pizzas littering the streets of Jecheon.  The funny thing is, my friend says it was one of the strangest and tidiest times she's ever seen someone vomit. I stopped walking , said "I really don't feel good," bent over at the waist with my upper body horizontal to the ground, threw up in one heave, then stood up straight again, and kept on walking. I didn't even get anything on my shoes.  I think some higher power was watching out for me - they knew that I had to wear the same jeans home.  I feel like shit today though. I think I may have food poisoning of some sort, because my stomach has been a ball of nausea and pain all freaking day.

      It is still impossible to access some sites directly from Korea, but I have found a free proxy server that I can use. So I'm using it. I have no idea how it works, but since I can now read almost everything I could before, I'm happy. I can't read the comments on my blog, though, so I apologize in advance for not responding to any of them. Not that I'm particularly vigilant about that anyways, so you're probably used to no response.  You know, the last time I couldn't see what I wanted, was when my mother saw me watching Friends one day (the episode when Chandler's romance novel writing mother comes to town) and decided it was too advanced for a girl of my impressionable age (14 at the time).  Um, Mom? I hate to break it to you, but it had been a bit late for monitoring my TV watching since I was 12 years old and innocently started reading the old paperbacks off of Grandma's bookshelf one summer.  So, which of my relatives used to read Harold Robbins and Jackie Collins?

      Why does Korea suck? Because I can't access any .blogspot.com websites.  Why can't I access any? I understand that all blogspot isps have been blocked, courtesy of the Ministry of Information and Communication in Korea.  Why have they been blocked? Due to offensive footage of the Korean who was beheaded in Iraq, or offensive footage making fun of the Korean who was beheaded in Iraq.  Why does this make sense? I don't know, you tell me. Anyone currently living in some totalitarian state out there who can explain the reasoning behind this kind of mass censorship?  What can I do? Well, someone said just use a good proxy server. If any computer literate people out there could tell me what a proxy server is, and how I would find a good one, and how I would use it, could you maybe email me the details? I'd really appreciate it.

      People familiar with some Asian cultures probably know the thing they have about never wearing shoes in their houses. At least in Korea, shoes in the house are a big no-no. You know a party is going on down the hall not just from the voices, but from the half open door with a big pile of shoes falling into the hall. What is surprising is that there are plenty of public places where you are expected to remove your footwear in. Restaurants where you sit on the floor, for obvious reasons, don't let you wear foot wear in that portion of the restaurant. I've been in a museum where you had to take off your shoes - perhaps the clack of hard bottomed footwear was not in keeping with the scholarly atmosphere they were trying to cultivate? Often, there are communal slippers provided for everyone's use at the entrance. The school I am teaching at is one of those places where outside footwear is forbidden. And they have communal slippers for everyone to use. Now, usually teachers and students will have a pair of indoor shoes they use, but I have been too lazy to get around to doing that, so I've been using the communal footwear for the past three months.  Sometimes, even the indoor shoes or slippers must be taken off before entering some of the classrooms we use, such as the library and the playroom. Today, I had part of my class in the library. When we were finished in the library, we all got up and went to the door, the students as usual much faster than me. So, I was the last person out, and I looked down and was shocked to see - no slippers! Someone had absconded with my slippers!  Who was the guilty party? Why, my Korean co teacher, who said to me "We were out of slippers." Well, yes, we were, but didn't it occur to her that by taking mine, that meant I had no slippers? So, in the break between that class and the next class, it occurred to me that I could go down to the fourth floor (the school is on two floors) and get a pair of slippers from there. Except, it was locked. So I spent the remaining hour on the fifth floor sans slippers, and feeling mightily self conscious about it.   Now, what I want to know is: Why did the Korean teacher figure she needed slippers more than me? Why didn't it occur to her to go downstairs and get some - since she has a key? What can you tell about a person from the fact that they were more than willing to steal another person's slippers? What can you tell about a person from the fact that they care that their slippers were stolen?  Hmmm, such weighty subjects occupy my mind here in Korea...

      I will admit that I have not covered myself in home improvement glory given my ongoing inability to resolve the burnt out bathroom light. Still, it seems I'm still a little better than at least one of the Korean kindergarten teachers.  I walk into the teachers room after one of my classes. There is no clock on the wall. It is sitting on my desk. "What happened?" I ask. "It fell off the wall," she says.  Well, obviously. And you thought my desk was an excellent new home for it?  The screw the clock hung on was stuck inside the clock, in a space a little too small for fingers to reach. So I dug out my tweezers, pried it out, then got out my handy Swiss army knife key chain, screwed the screw back into the wall, and hung the clock back up.  Jeez, it wasn't that difficult. I swear, she didn't even bother to try. At least I try.

      Today we had a blackout for about ten or fifteen minutes during the evening. It was kind of fun.  One teacher got trapped in the elevator. That would not be so fun.  Everyone seemed pretty panicky when the lights first went out - there was plenty of shrieking and screaming. They seem perfectly fine letting everyone know they're afraid of the dark - I think in NA kids that age try not to do that so much, makes them seem a little too much like kids, not the adults they're trying to be. Here they are still most definitely children, and they don't seem in a rush to act mature. One student today, when we were talking about having a boyfriend, said she was still too young and didn't think about that yet. Well, actually, her words were more along the lines of "my mentality is still a child." But I got what she meant.  There were no flashlights or candles to be had in the school. What do you think people in Korea use when there are no lights around and it's too dark to see?  Their cel phones.

      It has been raining almost non stop since early Saturday morning. The rainy season is here. A thunder storm just started. I would go outside and take pictures, but I'd be worried about ruining my camera. Also, I don't think Korea is up to the site of Cheryl in pajamas. I am actually wearing pajamas tonight. Mostly because the wind is causing my blinds to blow in such a way that the people in the apartment building across the way can see into my room. Also because I am typing with my laptop on my - surprise! - lap, and having bare legs while doing so can be a very uncomfortably hot experience.  Does anyone feel like making a diagnosis? I have a headache, seriously swollen glands in my neck, an occasional low fever, general weakness and fatigue (more than my usual brand of laziness), slight nausea and loss of appetite. Anyone know what I might have? It won't kill me, will it?

      Great suggestion Rea!  Thanks to Rea, you will all now have something to look at other than text.  Of course, I will probably start spending even more time messing around on my computer, not to mention trying to figure out all the nifty things my camera can do. Oh well, it's not like my social life in Cheongju is any more fantastic than in Jecheon. It still consists mainly of eating, drinking and playing pool. There are just more places to do it and people to do it with.  I think I have found myself a hobby. I have to say, I love the instant gratification aspect of a digital camera. It isn't like film, where you have to wait wait wait before you know that every shot you took was crap. This way, I know right away that I suck at photography. But at least I can delete the really bad ones, instead of having to pay for them. And it's fun anyways.

      For anyone who's been waiting anxiously to find out what I bought in Seoul, take a look.     That's right, I bought myself a tasty concoction called patbingsu.  Now, some people might say "Cheryl, why the hell would you pay good money to eat shaved ice mixed with sweet red beans, fruit, ice cream, and a few sprinkles?" To which I reply, "Um...because it tastes good?"  Oh, yeah, and I bought a digital camera, too.

      I went up to Seoul yesterday, to meet up with some friends from Jecheon. The original intention was to go shopping. I ended up getting in late, and my friend got in later. So, what with one thing and another, we just decided to head straight to Itaewon, and a bar called Helios, to drink a few pina coladas and eat some nachos while waiting to meet everyone else.  (And let me just stop for a second to say that these were really horrible nachos, they didn't have real cheese on them, just some liquid cheese stuff drizzled on the top. And the salsa tasted like there was ketchup in it. They did have olives, jalepenos and ground beef on them, so I guess they weren't totally substandard. And the staff was cute, so at least the scenery was nice.)  After everyone showed up and we finished our drinks (I now know never to suggest just leaving beer on the table) we decided to go over to Mogul, an Indian restaurant, for dinner. On our way to Mogul, we ran into a halfdozen of the only people I know from Cheongju. They were in search of a bar, Bricx. I had been there once, so I tried to give them some help. I give truly horrible directions though, so I hope they aren't still wandering around down there today...  There was a great buffet there, with long grain! rice for once, samosas, a couple of kinds of curry, desserts, mmmm.... Once we left Mogul, a couple of people decided they wanted to go to Hongdae instead of staying in Itaewon. Whereas Itaewon is packed with foreigners and GIs, with very few Koreans, Hongdae is full of mostly Koreans with a sprinkling of foreigners. They're both full of bars and people partying hard.  And the drinking/bar hopping part of the night was the same as always, only in different bars with different people. People got very very drunk (though I wasn't one of them) they danced like they were crazy, (Again, not one of them. Okay, well maybe a little.) picked up guys (one more no here) and even made out on the dance floor (again, no). In fact, by the time we left the bar, around 6:30, and went out for dak tori tang (spicy chicken and potato soup), I was stone cold sober. And quite amused at the collection of men the girls I was with had accumulated and were trying to get rid of. And how the men just weren't paying attention at all.  After we ate, and ditched the boys, we wound up back in Itaewon, where myself and two girlfriends spent a few hours sleeping in bath-house. I've never done that before, though I knew that you could. It's pretty cool, you go in, they give you a towel, a pair of white shorts and a t-shirt, and a locker to put your stuff in. You can shower and bathe and do a bunch of other spa-ish things, then throw on your uniform and go crash in the sleeping area on the floor. Cost: 6,000 won. Now I know where I'm spending the night everytime I come to Seoul. A warm place to sleep and a place to get clean. What more do you need? Though, a little bit of privacy would be nice, I'm not a big fan of all that public nudity.  We got out of Itaewon around one this afternoon, but didn't get much shopping done. I think we were pretty burned out from the night before. Well, I was anyways. Given that my original intent was to go shopping, it would seem like the weekend was a waste. But all in all, it was really a good one. I got to see friends, ogle cute waiters, eat Indian food, dance, sleep in a bath-house, and not be stared at on the streets. What more could I ask for? I can always go shopping again next weekend.  Oh, and guess what the one thing I bought this weekend was?

      Does anyone want a postcard from Korea? Send me your address, and I'll send you a postcard. This offer is indefinite and open to everyone who happens to be reading this blog. (This goes doubly for family and friends - if I haven't sent you one yet, that's probably because I don't have your addresses.) Actually, I'll even send one to people you know that might like one that don't read this. I can't promise to write anything witty or interesting on them, though. By the way, in case you want to send me one (I'm sure you knew that was coming) my address in Korea is:  Cheryl Hamilton apt 201 bld 667 (30/2) Gaeshin-dong, Heungdeok-gu Cheongju-shi, Chungbuk 361-805 South Korea  Hey, I just typed that all from memory.

      I went to the pharmacy this afternoon to buy some ibuprofen - thank God those guys that take medicine and stuff get forced to learn English pretty well too.  I got this little blister pack of 10 pills for 2000won. Which is just over two bucks. I thought that was pretty damn expensive, until I realized that the pills are 600mg. I mean, regular strength Advil is only 200mg, right? And extra strength is 400mg, isn't it? So, isn't it more like paying 2 bucks for 30 Advil? But this isn't extra strength or anything, this is just the regular dose. I guess Koreans have some serious pain.  I know Koreans are into skirting the bounds of copyright infringement, maybe it sounds cool to Korean ears, but the name brand of this drug is A-prin, and just seems completely strange to me. First, because it isn't even the same stuff in it as in Asprin, if that's the name they're looking to play off of. And secondly, because the pronunciation makes it sound like 'apron', and I can't really take a drug called apron seriously.  Oh, wait, it's starting to kick in, the cramps are vanishing like magic, maybe I can take it seriously...

      I feel depressed today, and I know that it would be so easy to let myself slide into that kind of murky, static place, where I don't do anything, don't want to do anything, don't see or talk to anyone and don't want to talk to anyone.  It rained this morning. I got a new schedule for work today. I now work Fridays. I am unhappy with this.  I teach a class of four completely apathetic middle school girls who will not stop speaking Korean. They say stupid things like "chincha" that even I can translate from Korean to English. If I can say it in Korean, they damn well know it in English. They've been studying English for four years at least, but they can't be bothered to even try to get themselves into the mindset for it. It makes me feel like a failure. It agravates me. I can't get them interested in anything for longer than five minutes, and I have to find some way to fill the other eighty five. Without making them bored and making them complain to their parents and having the director come talk to me about trying to make my classes more fun. I am not a fucking performing seal. I should know better, I've been here before. I hate the whole Korean attitude towards business and education, and particularly the way they mix the two. But I'm living here, benifitting from it. What a hypocrite.  I am staying away from middle school next time. Kindergarten, elementary, fine. And I'd love to try teaching some motivated adults. But I am not equipped to deal with teenagers.

      If anyone out there has been perusing some of the blogs that have the new, post blogger renovation layouts, you might have noticed that one of the additional features is a profile. When completing this profile, you have the opportunity to answer some random question. I don't have a profile, but here are some of the questions and my answers:  "Please describe how you could take the peel off an apple all in one go:" Um...with a knife?   "Your people want to make a statue in your honor. What will it be made out of and what victory will it commemorate?" It won't be a statue, it'll be a hologram, that way when they decide to tear it down the clean up will be easier. And it will commemorate the victory of common sense over stupidity, and annoying phrases like "your people".  "In the dream where you show up to school naked, how come you never go swimming?" Actually, in a dream where I showed up to (high) school naked, I went swimming in a pool that was set in the middle of the cafeteria.

      So, I have fixed a few of the problems I was having. My telephone is now functional, so feel free to call (just remember the time difference!)  My washing machine is no longer a problem either - having got no advice from anyone reading this, I did what I said I was going to do and dumped some draino down the drain. And now I no longer have to worry about minor household tidal waves and such.  As for the jeans...um, Mom? I have a favor to ask you...  I defragged my hard drive yesterday. I don't know if I'm supposed to do this on a regular basis though. Any computer people know? Is it a once in a blue moon thing, like cleaning the furnace ducts, or more like cleaning the bathroom? Or cleaning the guest bathroom?  Speaking of bathrooms, while I was cleaning mine, I realized that I don't need a chair to change my bathroom light, I can stand on the toilet to do it. And what did I discover? As far as I can tell, there is no way to change the light. The fixture feels like it's embedded in the ceiling. There are no screws or catches or basically anything I can grip or move, as far as I can tell.  Does this make any sense at all to anyone? My bathroom in Jecheon had a thoroughly difficult light fixture to remove as well. I had to get someone to change it for me. Why, oh why, is basic home maintenance so difficult in Korea?  As far as I can tell, there are two real solutions to this - renovate, or move house. I'm lazy and cheap though, so I'm probably just going to buy some candles.

      I am going on vacation. Yay! I think this calls for a poem.  Ahem.  I am going on vacation to a foreign destination an undisclosed location Can you guess what it might be?  It isn't on an island; It isn't at all in-land. I won't spend Yen, Won or Rand At this city by the sea.  Yeah, yeah, gimme a break, you try writing a work of literary merit after midnight in under three minutes.  So, wanna try and guess where I'm headed? Let's turn it into a game. If you guess the right answer, I'll send you a prize! (And those of you who know already, no hinting, helping, or bragging that you know, okay?) This poem isn't very helpful though, so I'll have to think of some totally obscure clues that will only make sense after the fact. Hmmm...  Clue 1 ---> The most fraudulent way?

      Thank you, Ron, for cluing me in on what was going on with my blog - since it's a pain in the ass to view right now, I never check on it.  It seems that half my template has mysteriously deleted itself. Everything that used to come up on the sidebar underneath what you see has vanished. What the fuck?  I cannot deal with this right now. What a bloody pain in the ass. And it isn't like I have it saved anywhere, so I'm going to have to redo everything that used to be up there. Maybe its time for a serious template change. At least one thing has been solved. I now know why site meter has said for the past two weeks that no one visited my blog, when I knew that people were.  This morning is not a happy morning. First the whole waking up early-ish thing. Not to mention the waking up and already being covered in sweat thing. And now the blogger has eaten my blog thing.  Grrr.... I'm going to go have a shower and a kiwi.  Does anyone else find it ironic that blogger's spell check doesn't recognize blog, blogger or blogging as words?

      I went to see Harry Potter at the theatre today. You get assigned seats, ours were right at the back, but dead center, pretty decent since there were probably twenty tickets left when we bought ours. And guess what the set at the concession consists of? Two drinks, popcorn, and... you guessed it, that's right, dried squid! Mmm, yummy! Admission was 6000 won a person, hmmm, reminds me of when I was a teenager. And you old people out there about to say "when I was a teenager it cost 25 cents for a matinee", yeah, okay, but do you really want to date yourself that way?  Isn't Harry supposed to be about 13 years old in this movie? He's looking a bit older than that. Maybe I'm just so used to all my 13 year olds that are really 11 or 12 that it's hard for me to tell.  And maybe I've got a bad memory, but I barely noticed that there was a different actor playing Dumbledore in this movie than in the first two. I think I like the new guy better.  Also, did anyone else wonder about that kid that plays Harry's cousin, what's his name, Duddley Dursley? Anyways, this kid, I assume he's going to probably wind up playing the character all the way through. But consider that the character is not the nicest person in the world. And then there's the whole weight thing. Do you imagine that this boy, he hit his growth spurt, started to get taller and skinnier, and his mum said, "Eat more, you have to fatten up to stay in character." And then there's the fact that for the rest of his life, he'll be vaguely familiar to people, but we won't remember who he is or was, we'll just have these vaguely unpleasant feelings associated with him.  I really enjoyed the movie. Bits of it made me feel less than completely fond of Harry Potter, though. I mean, come on, shouldn't he have been at least a little bit worrieder when he exploded his Aunt like that? Which just goes to show you, JK Rowling really knows her stuff, he's just like a real teenager.  So, when's the next one coming out?

      ...we now return to our heroine, who has just entered the grocery store in pursuit of that elusive carbonated beverage known as diet coke. As she enters the store, she veers left towards the produce, navigating her way past motionless ajummas and awkwardly laden ajosshis. Suddenly, there in front of the nectarines, her nemesis appears.  "Wayguk saram, wayguk saram!" the evil little devil's minion in the disguise of a little girl cries.  Our heroine dodges through a tiny space between the cucumbers and shopping carts, then races past the kimchi and tofu, hoping to elude the shrieking imp. Just as she reaches the back of the store, believing it safe to slowly peruse the many odd beverages available and resume her quest, a voice cries again, "wayguk saram, wayguk saram!"  Alas, she has been found. Our heroine dives behind a towering assortment of seaweed products, waiting patiently, listening to the fierce creature gallop around, filling aisle after aisle with her piercing cry of "wayguk saram".  At last the voice fades, the heroine fulfils her quest to locate diet coke, and makes her way cautiously to the checkout. Relieved, she hands her prize over to the cashier. Suddenly, a voice pipes up behind her. "Wayguk saram!"

      Changdeok palace is in the middle of Seoul. But you wouldn't know it while you're standing in it, especially in the rear garden, or, as it's also known, Biwon, which means secret garden. Though how anyone could keep something that size a secret is a complete mystery.  If you ever make it to Seoul, and want to see Changdeokgung, you should know in advance that they're going to take you for a ride. Every other palace you can tour around on your own, but here, if you want to see the garden, you have to go on a guided tour. And you have to pay extra to take the guided tour. I mean, it almost cost me three whole dollars! That's completely unreasonable.  The palace is about 6 centuries old, though bits of it have been burned down and rebuilt a few times, some as recently as the last century. It's still really impressive. Here is a shot of the changing of the guard in front of the gate, the oldest two story wood gate in Seoul. I think its four hundred years old. Obviously they've given it a few coats of paint since then.    This is the main hall where the king sat and waited for all the peons to come begging for their lives and stuff.    And here is a close up from under the roof of one of the buildings. It's kind of surprising, the first time you realize how much effort goes into not just the really visible exterior, but the ceilings and under the roofs and things I normally don't look at twice. Or even one. This one is mesh free, but usually there's a bunch of wire netting covering them, I think to prevent pigeon infestations.    Next up is the rear garden. Here is the guide, with her handy portable mike, telling us that the inscription on the stone gate supposedly blesses anyone who passes through with health and long life. Hmmm, and how many times can we go through?    She was a good guide, clear voice, decent accent, though the first ten times she said "rear garden" I thought she was saying "real garden".  And here we are, through the stone gate, by some buildings and ponds, though what the buildings were for I can't quite remember.        Just to prove I really was listening some of the time, the shape of the pond (a square) is supposed to represent the earth, and the shape of the island (a circle) is supposed to represent the sky, and so there's all this harmony and stuff. Okay, so I wasn't listening that closely.  I was trying to figure out why the earth was represented by a square. Anyone know?  (Hee hee, I just had to laugh, and share the fact that when I spell checked this post, the dictionary didn't recognize peon as a word. The first word suggested as a replacement was penis. tee hee. Okay, enough juvenile snickering, now back to work.)  By the way, peon is a word, isn't it?

      These are a couple shots I took walking along the main drag in Itaewon Saturday before I gave in and hid out in the PC bang.         There's one picture I really wanted to put up here, but didn't. Unfortunately, the writing is too small and blurry to appreciate the faux this, that and Club Monaco bags hanging in front of the "Hustler" handbags beside the "Happy Day 10000won" sign. Ah, copy right infringement... Ever since I read No Logo, I have a much greater appreciation for it. Go Korea Go!  Here's another photo from Gyeongbokgung, the palace that I didn't actually go in. This is a shot of the ceiling inside the main gate.     And here is a shot of the main gate from the inside.     One thing I love about Korea is how cheap it is to see stuff like this. It cost me 700 won to get into Unheyongung. That's under 70 cents US. Not even $1 Canadian. Is there anything you can go see in those countries for that price?

      I am back from Seoul with plenty of photos. It'll take me a bit to get my act together and post them.  Anyways, here is a photo from Gyeongbokgung, a palace that we visited. Well, not really. We got off the subway there anyways.       Sometimes, when you're standing in the middle of Seoul, it's really hard to believe that you're standing in the middle of Seoul.

      I am sitting in a PC bang in a building on the main street of Itaewon. I've never used a PC bang here before, it surprisingly took me a while to find one. They're kind of like taxis and police - everywhere until you actually need one. I finally found this on the third floor of a building I had already walked by once. You gotta remember to look up in Korea, or you'll miss three quarters of the stuff around you. I probably looked kind of silly though, with my nose stuck in the air, neck craned to the side so I could read the signage as I walked by.  So, what has Cheryl accomplished today? Well, I woke up, and I think that's no small feat. Caught a bus to Seoul. Came to Itaewon. Picked up some stuff. Went to Insadong. Picked up more stuff. Visited a palace. Got completely hot and sweaty. Came back to Itaewon. I'm meeting Donna in about an hour and a half. And hopefully, we will eat some Thai food tonight. And then go see another palace tomorrow, or maybe Lotte world.  While I was in Insadong I stopped at this one street cart to buy a picture from an old Korean man. Before he rolled it up to sell it to me, he signed it and stamped it. This process took a little while; I stood there watching him as he did it. When I finally looked up, I realized that a crowd (well, six or eight) people were standing there watching this too, and one of them taking pictures. And this guy with his really nice, expensive camera, definitely a NAmerican, says to me, something along the lines of "That's a nice picture, do you know what it represents?" And I said "no." Then he said, almost chiding me for my ignorance, "it probably means something." So I replied, "yeah, it means I have to give this guy 20,000 won." Whoops. Maybe that was a little rude.  But seriously, do I come and watch you while you buy art in a galley? It isn't like the guy was still painting the picture, he was just writing his name on it and stamping it. If the camera happy wayguk had wanted a photo so bad, he could have paid for the priviledge himself. I think the guy was ethnically Korean, he was probably on a trip to reclaim his cultural heritage, he was probably offended that I didn't care. But really, only tourists buy stuff like this to hang on their walls and talk about what it means.   I don't know why people are so hung up on finding out what something represents. At the end of the day, it's still just a picture. If you ascribe some meaning to it, then that's what it means. Or, it can just be a pretty picture. And no offence, but has anybody else ever noticed that everything means friendship, long life, prosperity or happiness? You ever wonder if the seller just doesn't pick a random word from the list and throws it at you to make you feel more inclined to buy? I'm pretty sure I've heard some people saying one thing means something, and someone saying it means something totally different.  Okay, maybe that was a little harsh, I mean the guy was just curious. What can I say? I was in a nasty-ish mood, all hot and sweaty. I really really hate getting hot and sweaty in public. And it doesn't matter that there were plenty of other people out there today with sweat visibly dripping off their faces, and lots of Koreans fanning themselves. I really, really hate sweating. That is why I have parked myself in a PC bang to wait for Donna. That and because my feet are sore. And I even wore sensible shoes this weekend.  Although, I think I'm feeling recuperated enough to wander down the street in search of a nice cold... well, a nice cold non-alcoholic beverage of some sort. I have not had any alcohol in three weeks. Are you shocked?

      For lack of anything else to write, I thought everyone might like to see some of the strange beverages a person can encounter in Korea. Last year, I kind of shied away from trying them. This year though, I am determined to give them all a shot - after all, when ever will I have the chance again? It isn't like there's anything  really  toxic in any of them. At least, I hope not.  This one is actually one I really like. I think it tastes great, and I encourage everyone to go out and try it. Just don't let the thick, murky, grey color of the drink scare you off.

      This morning I awoke at the freakily early time (for me) of 7am to catch an early train to Jecheon. Oddly, the taxi ride from my apartment to the train station cost 5,500 won, almost as much as the ticket from Cheongju to Jecheon, which cost 5,600 won. Hmmm.  Here is a photo of Angela   and me   and our breakfast.   In case you're wondering what that is, it's called kimchi bokkumbap. There's rice and fried kimchi, topped off with a fried egg in a super hot pot, and you mix it all up together and eat it with a spoon. Mmmm, and look, they even fried our eggs in the shape of a star and heart!  We spent the day wandering around and shopping in the small downtown area in Jecheon. I have decided that rainy days are the perfect day to shop - the stores are practically empty and the weather is cool. Of course, it is kind of annoying, having to deal with your umbrella - everytime you go into a store, you have to close it up and leave it at the entrance, so I usually get a fair bit of water on me. Maybe that's why there aren't so many shoppers.  This is a shot of Angela modeling one of the freaky sunvisors that some Koreans wear. Why, why, why?   Here is another friend of mine that is teaching in Jecheon.   By the way, Donna is 24, Canadian, is tons of fun to hang out with, has a great sense of humor and likes beer! If there are any nice single men in the vicinity of Jecheon who would like to get to know her better, please email me your contact info, vital statistics, and a brief introduction and I'll forward them onto her.  This was what we had for lunch, it's called deokkalbi.   Deok means rice cake, and kalbi means ribs. It's this fabulous tasty mess of chicken (breasts usually), rice cake, cabbage and few other green things fried in a spicy sauce. They bring it to your table raw, and you cook it there on a burner. Towards the end, you can also add noodles or rice and fry that up in some extra sauce as well. I would have taken pictures of the side dishes and the cooked product, but I was too busy eating to play with my camera.  Last, here are a few shots from the train window shortly after I left Jecheon.     It was a horribly overcast rainy day, but at least it was nice and cool.  By the way, belated birthday wishes to my country of non-residence, and it's neighbor to the south. Hope everyone had a good time celebrating.

      There is a petition at http://www.petitiononline.com/hole64/petition.html to the Korean Ministry of Information and Communication about their internet blockade. What? They don't even have four dozen signatures? Is no one paying the least little bit of attention to Korea? Not even most people in Korea? Isn't anyone offended by this, not merely for the annoyance factor, but for the fact that it's censorship and a government that claims to be democratic can't go around telling adults they can't read and see things for their own good? Please, go to this website and sign the petition. And ask all your friends to go there and sign the petition. And post something on your website and get those people to sign the petition.  Does signing petitions do any good? Who knows. Probably not. But at least it's nice to see lots of other people think that the MIC are annoying, wrongheaded morons, too.

      I don't know if this has anything to do with the restriction of access to certain domains here in Korea, but I haven't been able to access the CBC's website when I've tried the past few days. I didn't think it did, but then I tried to access it through a proxy at work today and it loaded fine. Does this mean that it's been banned as well? One wonders what the CBC did that offended the Koreans. Or the Globe and Mail, which I tried to access without a proxy and couldn't, and then with a proxy and had no problem. Has the Canadian media shown any of the video?  Incidentally, did everyone hear about the busload of South Korean tourists that got hit by a C-train in Calgary on Thursday? You know, it's pretty damn hard to hit a C-Train, there are all those lights and bells. You really have to be either completely distracted or a complete idiot or really trying in order to hit one. Who was driving that bus anyways?

      For those not in Korea, which is most of the people that read this.   ajumma , noun. literally, aunt; generic term used to refer to a generic woman  "Ajumma" is what you call the women who works in the restaurants - "Ajumma! Yogiyo! Maekju hana dol chuseyo!" (Lady! Over here! One more beer, please!) and as far as I know, this is considered the thing to do. I still can't bring myself to say "Yogiyo!" to get anyone's attention, let alone call a strange woman "ajumma". But when people talk about "an ajumma" they seem to mean a woman of a certain age and social status. They sell things in the market, they work on a farm, they gossip loudly in groups, they elbow past you on the street and in the subway while wearing scary sunvisors and weird clothes in loud prints and bright and metallic colors.   dongchim , noun, verb. to dongchim someone is to give them a dongchim. To give someone a dongchim is widely considered a truly hilarious thing. A visual demonstration is really needed but I will try to explain. The person giving the dongchim clasps their hands, palms together, index fingers extended and the rest of the fingers folded over each other, kind of like making a shooting gesture with two hands. They then attempt to insert the two index fingers up the arse of the person they are giving the dongchim to. Hilarious, no?  No.

      Teaching English in Korea obviously has it's negatives, but if I didn't think that the positives outweighed it, then I wouldn't have come back for a second go round. So, what are some reasons people wind up here?  Well, certainly there is the financial aspect of it. Take any generic university graduate with a degree in the humanities. What is a typical salary for a grad with a history degree? I don't have a clue. But I imagine that it can be hard to pay off student loans and still do all the things you want to do on your salary. Can you easily save money? Probably not. Now, if you take a graduate who comes to Korea to teach English. What are they making their first year? Well, probably less. Around 2,000,000 won a month. (1,000 won is something like $1.10 Canadian or $0.85 US - I usually just think in terms of 1,000 won equaling a dollar. So, 2 million won is about 2 grand.) But, the two biggest expenses at home - taxes and housing - in Korea, well, taxes are negligible, and free housing is part of the contract. So you really do have about 2 mil a month to spend on food and whatever other necessities and entertainment you like. Probably the two biggest expenses for the average EFL teacher here are food and beer. You can easily, easily, save a thousand dollars a month. If you actually try to save money? You could probably get by on half that. Actually, there were definitely some months where I spent 500,000 won or less, just because I was being a bit of a recluse that month, but I wasn't even trying to save money, and certainly not denying myself anything. Of course, the months I spent 2 million won made up for that.  Then there is the nature of the job. Since I've only ever had a hagwon job teaching children, not adults, we'll talk about that. A hagwon is an academy that tutors students after school, in pretty much anything. Koreans send their kids to hagwons for everything, especially English, and there are tons and tons of English hagwons. It is appalling easy to get a job at one of these. Once you get into the swing of things, life as a hagwon teacher can be annoying, irritating, exasperating, and boring. But it is rarely difficult, and doesn't come with a hell of a lot of responsibility. And the average hagwon teacher probably spends about 30-35 hours a week at school - not necessarily teaching or working, just at the school. People say that teaching English in Korea is like university, except with more money and less responsibility. (Of course there are exceptions. There are certainly teachers with lots of responsibility who do lots of work and take their jobs very seriously. This is not typical, as far as I can tell. And it often isn't encouraged at hagwons. Hagwons are businesses, they have to attract students, and they do that by hiring foreign teachers and making sure it's not boring - teaching too much is not good, you have to entertain as well.)  Another reason people teach English here - it delays entry into the "real" world. The vast majority of people working here do not view this as a potential career, they don't take it very seriously. What you do here, it isn't even part of your real life, because no one you know is around to see you, and when you leave you probably won't see any of these people again. It gives you the freedom to reinvent yourself. If you don't know what you want to do after university, if you're still trying to "find yourself", you can go to Asia and teach English while you figure it out.  And then there is the exotic, travel and see the world, live in a foreign country and go home with cool stories aspect of working here. Plenty of people stop while traveling to teach English until they make enough money to travel some more.  People also teach here because they like Korea. Sure, there are negative things about it, but every place has those. Some things to love about Korea are - the ease of existing without a car in this country, bars that stay open until you leave even if that's at 6am, 24 hour kamjatang restaurants, 24 hour kimbap restaurants, the people, the absence of -40c weather in the winter, Seoul, kalbi, the side dishes that come with your kalbi, no sales tax at the til, a corner store on every corner, ondol (floor heating), ice cream bars that are 50 cents, the list goes on...  Seriously, working and living in Korea can be fun, as long as you have your head in the right place for it - you let the annoying stuff roll off your back, and you have the time and money to take advantage of the fun to be had.  So, some reasons English teachers teach English in Korea are:  for money.  because it isn't very difficult.  there isn't much responsibility.  they like the freedom and money they have to learn !Xao/write the next great American novel/devote themselves to their music/work on their cubist paintings/sneak into North Korea and write a Pulitzer prize winning expose on Kim Jong Il they can travel.  for the ability to brag to their fellow suburbanites when they're forty years old that they used to live in a foreign country.  because they're social rejects at home and this is the only place they can find a job and a date.  because they like the attention a wayguk saram (foreign person) gets in Korea.  they actually like teaching.  they actually like Korea.  they actually like grammar.  they are a genuine EFL teacher and this is their career.  they're running away from finding a career.  they're running away from their old career.  they're running away from student loans.  they're running away from a bounty put on their head by the Mafia in another country.  because this is where God wants them to be.  I'm probably missing some, but I think I got all the major ones. As for which of these are applicable to me, well, I'll let you figure that out.

       ...for Gillian, who requested a reminder...   10 reasons why you don't want to teach English in Korea   Rice every single freaking day. Being stared at like an exhibit in a freak show. Or a hooker. Ajummas poking through your grocery basket. Being treated with as much consideration as a stapler. Always being the last to know. (oh, by the way, you have to teach a new class in 5 minutes) Students that cry/cough/bleed on you and constantly yell "game, teacher, game!" That foot smell. Parents. (my son is better than your son) (you play too many games) (you don't play enough games)   Involved directors without a clue. (I have this great idea...) The dongchim.

      Hey, I got Islam Spam! Not only do religion solicitors come to your door to sell their faith, they email you too. Although, I prefer this method. They're pretty polite about it, and I can just delete it without feeling guilty for slamming the door in their face.  Please forgive us for any disturbance, but we have an important subject to address to you regarding FAITH, and we Don't intend to overload your email with unnecessary messages... Let's only hope.  It says lots of nice stuff about Islam, makes it sound very good. Except. It's too bad that established Islam generally leans towards the extremist, fundamentalist side of things. Even the moderates don't seem very moderate at times. But yeah, the basic principles of Islam are pretty decent. I might, in some reality, be willing to convert to Islam. If I wasn't already Catholic. And I was actually interested in joining an organized religion. And, if it wasn't mostly run by a pack of scary angry misogynists.

Clue 2: Once, stretching from Morocco to Egypt? Clue 3: I actually had to wear a sweater or jacket sometimes while I was there.  Clue 4: Where red is "Golden". Clue 5: A five bridge view. Clue 6: Rainbow festooned Castro.  Okay, now someone has to get it.

      This kind of stuff always leaves me torn. On the one hand, reality is that there is a certain stigma attached to speaking with certain dialects in different countries. People with accents that are considered substandard or not proper English get held back by it. It's a definite benefit in life to speak with a "proper" accent.  But.  As someone who took a bunch of linguistic classes and even remembers some of it, I'm kind of scared by the institutionalization of language. It reinforces attitudes that there is a "correct dialect" as opposed to just a standard one. As far the dialect of a native speaker goes, they're all "correct" Englishes, just subtly or not so subtly different versions of it. It creates an even more definite advantage in the school system for students who already speak with a standard accent and don't have to learn a different dialect.  It's difficult to teach someone to change their speech, it's futile to try to teach a new dialect to someone who isn't motivated. Kids often switch dialects, subconsciously or consciously emulating the dialect of the group they want to be identified with. Are most of them going to want to identify with and emulate their boring, parental units and dictatorial teachers?  Whether it's a good idea or a bad one, I figure it won't work, and it'll just make people feel even more marginalized or separated or elite than they do already. Besides, if everyone spoke the same way, that would be really boring, don't you think?

      Everyone knows that you're supposed to drink eight glasses of water a day to stay properly hydrated. But who knew that there could be additional benefits?  urlLink Prozac in the water ? Man, I gotta move to England, that way if my students started driving me crazy I could just take a drink from my water bottle. Although, if I really needed it, straight vodka would probably be more effective than Prozac-laced water. But at least the water is free.

      I spent 45 minutes on Wednesday teaching the seasons, months, and days of the week and ordinals to one class. Well, it should have been review, but a lot of it wasn't. Only to have them not remember a single fucking thing today. In fact, while they could name two of the four seasons on Wednesday, they didn't know what the hell a season was today. ARG!  This job is getting to me. Why am I letting it get to me? I keep forgetting that I'm not really a teacher, I'm mostly a babysitter that just gets kids to parrot a few English sentences.  But now that I've vented I feel much better.

      I have reset my options so that non-users can comment on my blog as well. Sorry about that, Mom. And apologies to any other non-bloggers who read this that might wanted to have leave a comment but weren't able. So that's probably like, what? one lone soul?

      My ISP here in Korea is no longer constipated! I can access blogspot sites again!  Ah-ssah!  The weirdest thing happened though, I tried accessing my blog and it came up, but the first time it was my blog as of June 15. Which incidentally included an untruncated copy of my random things about me section, so I have tried to repair it yet again.   Vacation I suppose I should apologize for the complete and utter obscurity of my clues. But I actually like the fact that they're completely and utterly obscure. This clue is not so obscure.  Clue 3: I actually had to wear a sweater or jacket sometimes while I was there.  Oh man, it was so fucking nice, it was completely exhilarating to be cold again. Even though I didn't enjoy being cold, it was so much better than being hot and sweaty.   Passive Aggression I really hate it when someone tries to make you feel bad for going on vacation because they had to pick up the slack while you were away. It isn't my fault, I had it written into my contract, if you didn't want to do that much work, you should have gotten it written into your contract. Go complain to management. This is when I hate mostly liking people I work with. Because I know that every time I get management to take away some of the annoying extra stuff they've managed to heap onto me in the past four months, I know one of the other teachers is just going to wind up doing it.   Summer cleaning... Sometimes is seems really hard to throw some things out. I hang onto stuff with that sort of "just in case" mentality. What if I need it, and I don't have it? Won't I regret throwing it away? For some reason, today I finally managed to chuck out a bunch of makeup. Some of this is stuff I carted from Calgary, to Korea, then back to Calgary and back to Korea again, without ever using. That was easy to get rid of. Some of it, I bought recently, decided I hated, and don't wear. That stuff was easy to throw away. Some of it I really like, but use very infrequently, and that's harder to let to. I thought of it in a different way tonight. I thought, "No matter how much I like this color, no matter how good it looks on me, do I really want to hang onto eyeshadow that I've had since grade 11?" Jeez, when I think of it that way, it's kind of disgusting. Really gross, actually. Spending July in Cheongju probably aged it as much as five years in Calgary did.   cleaning house... I came back from vacation to discover some weird shit happening with my drains. I think things are growing in them. Ewww. Which makes me doubly glad that I bleached everything excessively before I left. I meant to defrost my fridge as well, but didn't quite get around to it, so that's one thing I'm doing tonight. I should do it more often, it's helping cool down my apartment.  For those who know about living in hot, humid places, what do you use to clean? What kills bacteria and mold completely? Other than dousing the surface with alcohol and setting fire to it?   and cleaning out the closet. While I was on vacation, I changed my earrings a fair bit. Well, twice anyways, which is really often for me. And it started me thinking, why do I still have all these earrings in my ears? I have three in each of my lobes, and one at the top of my left ear as well. What kind of statement am I making? What's the point? I've had them for so long I don't know why I have them anymore, they've gotten to be a habit, and a kind of annoying one too. I think I might like accessorizing, if it didn't take as much effort to change all the earrings all the time.  It makes me wonder, how much of what I wear and do and think are just habits that I've accumulated, that don't have a reason anymore, that if I re-evaluated them, I'd actually really like something else much more. Maybe I need to do a little more intellectual cleaning, go shopping for new ideas and try them on, get rid of those old patterns of thought that I slip into just because that's what's there, it's comfortable and it's easy.

      I am back from my vacation. I was having too much fun to blog about it. And no photos will be posted because, well, I didn't take any photos.  So, let's continue the guessing game, shall we? By the way, these clues are like annoying crossword puzzle type clues. So, when I tell you what the hell they mean, you'll be really really annoyed by how much sense they make, without making sense at all.   Clue 2: Once, stretching from Morocco to Egypt?
