        I had been a regular viewer of the TV show AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies, which aired on STAR Movies around 2-3 years back. I remember having wanted to watch all the movies on the list. But looking back at the list again, I seem to have made no headway. :(  I guess that calls for a fresh resolution.

      ... I had started this blog with an intention of chronicling my life and thoughts. But I seem to have failed miserably (at the beginning, at least)! :( But after having read most of the " urlLink Snapshots from IIM(Hel)L " blog, which my dear friend  urlLink Sharada Sinha  recommended, I have found new vigour and energy and have resolved to do a similar act with my blog. :)  So here I am in my lab blogging away, when the main purpose of my being here was to finish off the little work that's left in my DDP. :-P  Hopefully the first of the many to come... Regards Raju

      Been a while since my last post. Not that I have been deprived of incidents/thoughts to put into words, but I simply haven't found time. :( Leaving too much of your academic work to the end, does indeed have some drawbacks! :)  So what do I have against the vegetarians NOW? If you are a member of  urlLink Orkut , do search for communities with the keyword "vegetarian". Behold the amazing world of Vegetarians - people confused whether they-are or they-are-not! Almost Vegetarians, Temporary Vegetarians, what's that supposed to mean!?  Anyway, before people start throwing brickbats at me, let me clarify to all my VEGETARIAN friends - I LOVE YOU ALL! I am proud that you are saving so many animals... but remember there are people like  urlLink these , out there:     urlLink         Regards, Raju  PS: All Non Vegetarians can join the " urlLink Definitely Non-Vegeterian " community at Orkut. :-P Let this message help you make up your mind:     urlLink         PPS: Tyson, PC, please save your comments for some other blog

      I ran into PPS ( urlLink Pritam P Sukumar  for the uninitiated) this morning and he looked horrible! On enquiring, he said he had eaten a few spoonfuls of chicken, by mistake, the previous night and that he had been vomitting ever since! My remark: "Daya, how can anyone vomit after eating chicken!?" met with a disgusted look and an even more disgusted retort. :)  So what's with these vegetarians? Why do they find the very thought of meat nauseating? Do they detest the taste of meat or are they concerned about the animals?  "If we aren't supposed to eat animals, why are they made of meat?" :)  They may show great solidarity - they have thousands of Vegetarian Accociations/Unions. They might have better mortality. (Ref:  urlLink Mortality in vegetarians and nonvegetarians: detailed findings from a collaborative analysis of 5 prospective studies ).   But the fact is, dear vegetarian friends, "vegetables are interesting but lack a sense of purpose when unaccompanied by a good cut of meat."         Regards Raju

      A Poem By Mary Angelou  A free bird leaps on the back of the wind  and floats downstream till the current ends  and dips his wing in the orange suns rays and dares to claim the sky.   But a bird that stalks down his narrow cage  can seldom see through his bars of rage  his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing.   The caged bird sings with a fearful trill  of things unknown but longed for still  and his tune is heard on the distant hill  for the caged bird sings of freedom.   The free bird thinks of another breeze  and the trade winds soft through the sighing trees  and the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright lawn and he names the sky his own.   But a caged bird stands on the grave of dreams  his shadow shouts on a nightmare scream  his wings are clipped and his feet are tied so he opens his throat to sing.   The caged bird sings with a fearful trill  of things unknown but longed for still  and his tune is heard on the distant hill  for the caged bird sings of freedom.

      " It is with a kind of fear that I begin to write the history of my life. " - Helen Keller, The Story of My Life   ...I finally have a weB LOG up and running! Well, that brings us to the all important question - "Why blogging?"  urlLink Ankur , a very good friend of mine, had an  urlLink interesting post  about the purpose of a blog.   So why exactly would I need to blog? Who would want to read my musings on stuff - personal or otherwise!? Pray, what do I have to say that none have before or will after?  I guess I shall write (or blog), for as John Cheever so elegantly put it: " The need to write comes from the need to make sense of one's life and discover one's usefulness. " I guess in the process I will come out with some posts to keep Ankur "interested".  Regards Raju

      Well, I can't hold back the ecstatic feeling of sweat running down my back (for that matter, the entire body), the inexplicable soothness of cold breeze on my sweat-soaked face... Pardon me for the following outburst, for it is neither as interesting as  urlLink Prince Saleem 's outings nor as grandiose as  urlLink Mr. Saxena 's Europe trips... But if I still sound pompous and grandiloquent, blame it on the rarity (till now) of the incident...  Ever since my back forced me out of major physical activity, I have been looking forward to this day... To feel the blissful feelings only sport(s) can provide...  Anyway, I have this stupid knack, which I don't think anybody of you has realised so far, of starting things off at mathematically pleasing units of time e.g. starting work at 11:00:00 am, even if it's just 10:01:00 am and I have nothing else to do... I have been doing it for as long as I remember... It is a wonderful tool of laziness, without the usual pangs of conscience... You should try it sometime... So, I had planned on getting back to some physical activity and starting a new chapter in my life on June 1st 2004... Although, I failed to keep my date with history, I have finally done it today...  I woke up at 6:15 in the morning and ran around the campus (Cross Country minus the SAC rounds) WITHOUT A SINGLE HALT, but at a much slower pace than my youthful days... The campus looks amazing in the morning and it was eerily deserted today... I wish I could say the lakeside looked amazing, but the waterline had receded so far back that I couldn't even tell if a lake exists there anymore...  Stopped at the SAC grounds and lay in the center of the field for a while and savoured the smell and feel of dew soaked grass, something I'll always associate with Inter IIT... and lots of fun... And at that moment, it hit me hard and the feeling's finally starting to sink in... That I am no longer going to be able to do things I have come to love...  Anyway, I'll save the nostalgic feelings for another day, another post.  All this fuss for a morning run, you may say!? But I needed it desperately to get back to fitness and also do something about the "bun in the oven"(Hint 1: Kill Bill 2, Hint 2: Belly)... I hope to continue doing so for some time to come...  Coffee treat to everyone who manages to get to Coffee Shack by 9 AM!  Regards, An ecstatic Raju  PS: Nidhi, I am choking to death. I haven't used a single smiley.
