       A sketch of things to come...   This site is a temporary sketch of the cmOS internet operating system; which    in turn is a temporary sketch for a real OS, though what architecture I'm not    sure of yet.   Projected goals...   The goals of this project are:       To create a flexible, realible, user friendly, enviroment.     To create an open API for other programs to be built around.     To have a stable &quot;net&quot; enviroment to develop on and for; in essensce      making development time as minimal as possible.     To introduce new ways of thinking about an operating system by building      new interfaces, filesystems, file explorer's, and various other means of manipulating      data and visuals that our foreign to modern operating systems.     To have something for personal use so that we can be free of piracy of our      freedom of use, aka propriatary licensing.     To focus on running the computer instead of focusing on integrated programs      and features: the computer needs to be running first before you can show your      cool new media player!     Open source/open API...   I am creating an API for developers to use immediatly in their projects for    this OS. The API call will not change as this project is ported and goes through    it's growing pains: it will only expand. I will try to fight against bloat because    being the net it needs to be streamlined for bandwidth and various pc architectures    out there.   Everything API wise will be programmed in Flash MX+ so components will be used    extensively. The API will consist of entirely homegrown components. You will    be able to drag and drop these into your programs at will, after installing    the API, or should you wish you can, again after installing the API, call on    and expand on components using sheer code without having to touch the mouse    (except to compile;). This will make c, c++, or other language based programmers    feel more at home and at ease.   Source control of this project will be null. The spread of the source code    will be self propegating and decentralized. The official license is not drafted    yet and until it is the source code will be under the GPL. Anyone may take the    source code and do any project they please with it as long as they don't try    to come back to me and tell me I can't use it myself anymore! I refuse to be    handcuffed and hindered from doing my own work. No one will in anyway be prevented    from using the source code for their own projects or agenda's.   !m3talsmith   m3talsmith@mac.com

       operatingSystem = new cmOS();   news();   10.07.2003 - new project - !metalslinger   Here's a new project,  urlLink aBox  [roncari.net/aBox], that I've started as a social experiment. The idea is to create little gadgets and such that interact in public transparently with other devices compatible with it, etc...; and that's just one idea of many that will be posted. Some people will come up with a concept, others with help, and others with solutions. At the end there will be several products on the site open for anyones use commercial or non-commercial. I have one concept now that I will be posting soon as I get it all together. This will be a site to check on often and to to bookmark. I expect a lot of ground breaking ideas to flow through it.   Also as a response to my licensing issues with the cmOS project I have decided to start a site that will contain the license agreement in it. It will be separate and both aBox and cmOS will be using it. I don't have the site up yet but expect it within a month or so.   !metalslinger   04.03.2003 - logoIdeas - !metalslinger   Does anyone have any ideas for logos? mailto: metalslinger(at)roncari(dot)net    .    04.03.2003 - generalUpdate - !metalslinger   To anyone who may be keeping an eye on my small project I have a few updates.    I am currently writing an rss for this project as well as working on the windowing    classes and the first real layout for the site. Also I've been doing a lot of    research into human usability and spatial use and design. I have developed a    few test so far to test cmOS api's up against. I will be posting some of them    soon as well as some sketches of the api as it develops.   I'm also looking into putting a forum on here. Email me back if anyone is interested:    mailto: metalslinger(at)roncari(dot)net .   !metalslinger

        I have recorded this down for the annals of time. I predict in the near future this topic will be covered with so much spin, that it will be hard to know the facts. Here are some of the facts stated, the moment it's happening; before political spin can be added to it.     urlLink

      Just recently a smoking tax in the state of Michigan has been passed, to go into effect in July, that would add another $.75 to the price of cigarettes. I just read a write-up of it in the local Herald Palladium, to be posted to the net tomorrow.  Governor (governess?) Jennifer Granholm said the additional revenue will prevent the state from having to cut funding for its Medicaid program, which provides health benefits to low income adults and children.  [src: Herald Palladium : 4A : June 25th, 2004]   Governor Granholm has been quoted saying "This is a victory for every Michigan resident who is concerned about health care for our vulnerable citizens and reducing our overall health care costs," in a news release.  What she didn't mention was that "our vulnerable citizens" our usually the same smokers, and that they would just have their cost moved on them; instead of paying an extra amount for their Medicare, they'll instead take that cost and apply it to their beloved, and sometimes cursed, habit.  How does The State of Michigan hope to reduce this cost on "our vulnerable?"  She also stated, "In addition to raising money, I'm hoping it reduces smoking, which will result in better health, which will improve the economy."  It looks like the hope is in reducing smoking overall by making the price less bearable; also known as forcing morality by legislation. The only problem with this is that they don't (or did they) take into this rational addiction: smokers are not going to quit smoking just because the price went up. They will simply purchase from their cousin, aunt, etc..., that lives in another state, to get lower prices.  But wait! They're prepared for that too!  "I suspect you'll see adjacent States also raise their tax," said Governor Granholm.  Ok. That could be read two ways: "Now that we've done they know they can do it too and not get too much flack:" or "We can use political pressure to push them into legislation for the good of their citizens; hey just use the 'our vulnerable citizens' quote; it worked good for us." I'm sure you get the idea.  So we need to ask ourselves if this is really for the good of "our vulnerable citizens," or if it suits political ends better.  Again here the State's word, this time against the measure, "Take a deep and satisgying puff, smokers," Republican Sen. Nancy Cassis of Novi said, "Your expensive taste will feed the hungry and the sick."  I'll be out interviewing people on the streets today about this issue. Please post your comments.

      I just started this blog today and wanted to test it.  The purpose of this blog is to mark down different ideas, whether technology based or simple book ideas, opinions and news reports when I get the chance. I'm going to try and do most of my post via audioblog: since it's much easier to find time to call in, than to sit at a computer all the time.  Everything posted on this site is open. That means it's free of copyrights unless specified otherwise. I hope to open up a lot of ideas for the community to work on as a whole; and some of my post will be responses of the same kind. Check back often as I will be posting daily if not more.  Happy blogging!

      Here are some post that explain part of the controversy on abortion in the Libertarian party, and how most of us Libertarians feel about it. Here is the transcript:   Comment from: Brent Watkins  "He believes abortion it should always be illegal but that the constitution does not provide for legistlating any murder laws, even for full adults. Therefore this is an issue that he would leave to the states."  I assume that Badnarik would declare Roe v. Wade as illegitimate?  I disagree that abortion should ever be tolerated by any level of government. In Article IV, Section 4 of our Constitution, it says the Federal government must guarantee a republican form of government to the States. In a constitutional republic, rights are not up to majority rule, but instead on firm principle. As it says in the Declaration of Independence, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." Under Article IV, Section 4, I believe the Congress and/or the Executive is obligated to uphold the rights of all persons.  Also, I should add that the 14th amendment guarantees equal protection under the law. Allowing abortion while protecting the lives of those fortunate enough to be born is certainly not equal protection.   07/30/04 @ 20:35    Comment from: robre  The declaration of independence is not a legal document. It's like looking for legal proof in the articles of confederation.  The first section of the 14th amendment reads as follows: "All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."   or   "All persons born or naturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No state shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."  In otherwords an unborn child, by the constitution, is not under the jurisdiction of any state and so is not covered by the 14th amendment, but since the constitution does not define the jurisdiction or if an unborn person is a person or not then this is left to the states per the 10th amendment.  07/30/04 @ 21:23    Comment from: Tim West  I agree with Harry Browne's statement on Abortion, even though I dont care for him now becuase of all the trouble in 2000.   Something along the lines of :   Since government cant even properly protect the rights of people who are already born, what makes you believe it can protect the rights of the unborn?  Abortion is one of those issues that if allowed simply kills any chance of ever uniting a political party. As with all things that cannot be known to man, it should be left to God. Religion is a valuable tool for ones personal life, but the second it is used to extend a belief system beyond the individual it becomes something other than it's followers profess it is.     07/30/04 @ 21:27    Comment from: Michael Christenson · http://unstableman.blogspot.com/  robre,  I think first you would have to define born. Personally I feel if you have to kill a thing, it is alive, and therefore it should not have to be said that given proper time, it would be born, and as such must be protected.  I tend to agree with the statement made by Tim West contributed to Harry Browne.  Woman's rights do not cut it for me. And this is why. She had the right to choose to have sex or not to have sex. The course of such action, if left to nature, is pregnancy. Therefore to bear a child is the inherent consequence of having sex; again if left to nature.  I believe everyone should have all their rights, but I also believe in responsibility. Also the rights of one individual cannot interfere with the rights of another. One of our primary rights is the right to life. If you tried to preemptively kill someone it would be a violation of their right to life: also known as murder.  Given the natural recourse of sex is birth, then it could be said the natural course of sex is the endowing of the right to life upon that birth. It is also the natural consequence of such action, as well as the blessing. Since one must take responsibility for such actions, it is fair to say that once pregnancy has happened, life has been obtained, and it is the obligations of those who are the caretakers of such life, to protect it's first right, hence protecting the freedom's of not just that life, but of their life too. It would be irresponsible to try to deny the responsibility by taking on an act of murder against such in your care.  07/30/04 @ 21:54    Comment from: Michael Christenson · http://unstableman.blogspot.com/  Thus choosing to have sex or not is the woman's only real choice. She could gamble on contraceptives, but if they fail her then she is to blame for the pregnancy, not the life that is even then stirring in her body.  Now I know some people will immediately raise the case of rape. But let me ask you, is murder justified against the innocent, because you were innocent of the crime taken against you? Should you perpetuate such hate and malice? If it was a crime against you, it is a worse crime against those in your care!

      New post- Folks, here is an idea I've had a few days ago. Posted are excerpts of it being discussed with a trusted Libertarian to help work out the kinks.  [QUOTE=email] From: bbradley@cybersol.com ----- Original Message ----- From: "Michael Christenson"   To: "Bill Bradley"   Sent: Thursday, July 29, 2004 1:35 PM Subject: Re: Re: Libertarian Registration...   Bill,  ... As you eluded, in this day and age, the Libertarian Party should not be so difficult to deal with. One of my goals is to help iron these difficulties out. I know now that I will be a Libertarian for life, that I will be running for a Libertarian office as well as a public office in the very near future, and that I will be striving to help modernize the Libertarian Party, helping to smooth everything over.  I am currently working on this in two ways, helping the Badnarik campaign with their site, calendar, and what ever else they need volunteer work for, and making programs that will help future and currently disenfranchised voters to have a voice in future elections. Those are first steps.  Aside from that, I had an idea on my way to work today in reference to this years elections. It has to do with insuring voting accuracy. Here's how it would run:  We make a receipt book, with each receipt having spot for Name, Address, Phone, Email, and who you Voted for this election. It would be a 3 part carbon copy receipt pad. The top copy would say "for voter", the middle copy would say "for poll worker", the bottom copy would say "for voting verification". Near the bottom of each receipt you can have a small disclaimer stating that "this is not required to vote and is purely voluntary: that you authorize the use of this receipt ONLY for voting verification and at the request of said voter" with a place to sign and check that you've read the disclaimer. There should also be a phone number that the voter can contact for voter verification and to get questions answered. Each page should have only one receipt; in other words, one receipt per page: this is so that you still have voter privacy of sorts; write down one receipt and then promptly flip it to the next receipt.  Next step, we have a group of Libertarians, possibly one at each polling center, with a receipt book, asking people as they come out, whether they "would like a receipt of whom they voted for?" If yes make sure they fill it out correctly, keep everything as private as possible, and give them their receipt. If no then it's no big deal.  These volunteers should by no means try to harass or sell the idea of the receipt. They should insure the voter that all of it is private and that their voting information will not be passed on to other voters or organizations without their authority. Nor should the volunteers stress political views or parties. Everyone of them should be wearing a neutral Libertarian button; no Vote Badnarik in 2004, et cetera.  In this manner we will show that we are concerned that their vote counts and cannot be conveniently lost. And that the Libertarians are concerned for everyone's freedom to vote and be counted, without concern or coercion as to whom they vote for. It will build a more general reputation for us that may bring more respect to our party.  Step 3. At the end of the day, the volunteer(s) should go inside the polling center and give the center copy of every vote to the appointed booth volunteer. This should be worked out in advance as to whom the receipts are given to.  Step 4. The volunteer(s) should hand enter every vote receipt into either and online database, or onto a private server, where this information will be stored for future use.  The point of this system is to help protect against voter fraud and to put a more reputable light on the LP. We should advertise this a far in advance as possible, so that both the volunteers know what is going on, and the people know that it is an option to help against voter fraud.  This is of course a very loose idea right now; I've only had an hour to consider it. What are your thoughts on it?  In Freedom, Michael Christenson[/QUOTE] [QUOTE=email] From: bbradley@cybersol.com Subject: Re: Re: Libertarian Registration... Date: July 30, 2004 9:43:17 AM EDT To: m3talsmith@mac.com  Michael, ...  I appreciate your willingness to help out and to run for office. The LP has a lot of work to do and it is going to take a long time. We need all the help we can get.  Your idea about the voting receipt is interesting. Here are a few comments that come to mind. I think it would take quit a little promotion and organization, probably more than could be done in the remaining time available this year. One problem that would have to be worked out would be the fact that many different offices and propositions can be on a ballot and that would make it difficult to come up with a small receipt that could be filled out in a short period of time. One other thing that would have to be looked at would be the matter of cost effectiveness. Since resources are limited, would there be anything else more important or more effective that we would not be able to do if we put our efforts into this project? I don't mean to be negative, just trying to be realistic.  Bill Bradley[/QUOTE] [QUOTE=email] From: "Michael Christenson"   To: "Bill Bradley"   Sent: Friday, July 30, 2004 11:09 AM Subject: Re: Booth idea   Bill,  I agree with you on the booth idea. It is very hard to get funding and advertising for such a project. Also I was thinking about the time it would take to fill it out. I think it would be best just to have a unique number on each receipt and the receipts to only have:  Libertarian Republican Democrat Green Other ____________  With a check mark beside them. Scrap the name, address, phone part. Then it could be preformed very quickly.  As far as getting it going before this election, it would be nearly impossible to have it in full force. However starting it is something, even if it does not cover every booth. The next election could be better covered, and then as it gains momentum, eventually we could cover all the booths.  I've thought about funding and the spreading of the program. How do we get other Libertarians to do the same in other states? This is where the internet can be useful. I can make the template so that anyone can download it, get a block of unique numbers, and take it to the local printers or make it themselves. This would not only help in cost, but would also help in getting enough booth coverage.  One thing I've noticed since becoming active. The campaign itself is under manned, under funded, and under too many time constraints to handle everything. Part of the problem is the centralization of everything: it leaves hardly any room for the activist to do something. There are some serious time lags between a request and a response, for an activist to get an ok for a project.  A lot of this can be solved by decentralizing it a bit. Using the internet to help with this receipt idea is just one example of decentralization. When you decentralize things, volunteers can then become active. They can use their own resources and time to do things that the campaign neither has time to do, nor needs to be bothered with doing, and help spread the message faster and in some cases better.  Well those were my thoughts at 2 this morning. I use every waking moment I have to help forward not just this campaign, but the Libertarian ideals and cause as much as possible. I'm currently getting a crew of volunteers together right now, from various states, whom also want to help but that the campaign is too busy to be able to respond to them. I hope to mobilize soon no many ideas.  What do you think about all of this?  Michael Christenson[/QUOTE] [QUOTE=email] From: bbradley@cybersol.com Subject: Re: Booth idea Date: July 30, 2004 2:32:32 PM EDT To: m3talsmith@mac.com  Michael,  I like your comments about decentralization. It can often be easier for a small group to go ahead and start doing something and see what happens than to try to get a larger group to agree on what to do. If you do it on your own, or even form a group of your own, say a group of libertarians, you don't need permission from any officially organized LP group so long as you don't claim to represent and speak for the group. All ideas start out small and grow from there. Most probably fail along the way, but you never know until you try. I am old enough to have seen people accomplish things that I thought couldn't be done so I don't want to rain on anybody's parade.  Bill Bradley[/QUOTE]  So what do you guys think? There's plenty of room for change in this system. Let's see what we can do about this

Everyone has their own opinion. The trouble was, that as he kept posting this inane mush, I got more annoyed with it. Finally I couldn't resist. Here is what I posted:   Bush Led Terror Fled Insurgency Raised it's Ugly Head  Bush Denied Hunger Cried And Everyday Their Freedoms Die     Kinda catchy isn't it?

      Here's the latest Rasmussen Report done with Badnarik in it. Very interesting results; although not surprising to me.  --- Report ---  RasmussenReports.com  Monday July 26, 2004--Sixty-eight percent (68%) of American adults believe that Libertarian Party candidate Michael Badnarik should be invited to participate in the Presidential Debates this year. A Rasmussen Reports survey found that just 20% believe Badnarik should not be invited while 12% are not sure.   The Libertarian Party candidate has been on the ballot in all 50 states for each of the past three elections and Badnarik is expected to be on every state ballot this November.   When voters were asked to choose between President George W. Bush, Senator John Kerry, and Badnarik, 46% said they would vote for the Democrat, 43% for the Republican, and 3% for Badnarik.   However, 29% of voters said there are circumstances under which they would consider voting for Badnarik. That includes 25% of Bush voters and 30% of Kerry voters.   When voters are informed that Badnarik opposes both the War in Iraq and the Drug War, 34% say they would consider Badnarik.  That figure includes just 11% of Bush voters and 50% of Kerry voters.   The survey also found that 10% of Americans identify their political ideology as libertarian rather than conservative or liberal. Sixty-two percent (62%) share the Libertarian view that tax dollars should not be spent to support the Republican and Democratic National Conventions.     The national telephone survey of 1,000 Adults was commissioned by the Badnarik for President campaign and conducted by Rasmussen Reports July 21, 2004. Margin of sampling error is +/- 3 percentage points with a 95% level of confidence.

      "Do you know what the total amount of eligible voters was in 1996?" I asked a co-worker.  "No I don't" she said, "Actually, I've never voted. I'm registered but I've never voted. They just had this deal where if I registered I got an A in the class when I graduated."  What?!  That's right. You heard it here. The school system was actually grading in a particular class, based on whether you were willing to register to vote or not!  Where was this when I was in school?! "Yes, I'll register. I'll register twice if you make sure my A turns in to a nice shiny A+!"  She then went on to tell me that she has never voted because she doesn't have an interest in politics. I asked her if, someone wanted to make sure that income tax was never taken out of her paycheck again, if she were willing to vote for that person.  A resounding "YES!" "Now that's something that interest me." I then promptly showed her  urlLink Badnarik for President . Needles to say she was very interested.  So what can we say about this? Is it that  urlLink 47%  of eligible voters are to lazy to care about our country and how it runs? Or rather is it that we haven't given them anything that interest them? In other words, are we only looking out for the interest of , for all intents and purposes, half the population, and ignoring the other half?  In my opinion, it's the later. If you, with your presidential aspirations, want a real "uniter", you need something to reach all the people. Doesn't it seem reasonable that you would be able to at least grab 30-70% of the people and have close to 80-90% of eligible voters have their issues at stake on election day?  Think about it.

      This is a rough draft of a report I am conducting. Subsequent fuller reports will be filed as this get polished. The only reason I'm publishing this now, is because I feel that it's very important to bring these figures into the light as quickly as possible.  ---  [Report]  Due to the seriousness of this subject, I'm going to keep this report pretty much straight forward.   My supposition is that:       Our current election process is weakening      We are not meeting the needs of nearly half of our Voting Age Population ( urlLink VAP )      They do not give voice to our electorate, and thus      We do not act as a whole nation, but rather act as a divided nation, with one half silenced by the other half.    I will be using the past two elections as examples. Specifically, I will be using the debate of whether Ralph Nader really "stole" any votes at all, or did he simply bring more people to those sacred booths.  You will find, at the bottom of this page, the details in full and tabulated for your convenience. I hope you take time to browse them; and perhaps come to your own conclusions.  Onward...  [The Stolen Votes]  Democrats and Republicans both, have been warning us of the stolen vote; the votes that we would supposedly steal from them, if we choose to vote for another party. They are almost equal in their acceptance of this theory. They point to last years election, and Ralph Nader, as an example. So lets look at the Nader theory first then.  Let me introduce "Exhibit A".     1996 Presidential Election Results ::     VAP

      In all of the horrors of 9/11, Isreali/Palestinian conflict, Afghanistan, and Iraq, I feel that some people have forgotten that everyone is human. Particularly Americans.  We have waged war against Muslims without even taking time to consider whether what our government is saying is true. We act as if we've stored hatred in our hearts for years, and waited for these times to let it out. Many claim it is the Christian thing to do no less.  I'm hear to tell you that it is not the Christian thing to do. It is simply blind hatred towards those whom, the government claims, want to and will hurt us.   Many of us forget that there are such things as radicals in our midst, that are not of foreign decent; that they do not represent the whole of us; that such groups are usually ineffective and have little support; and that the same holds true for all people.  Muslims are people just like the rest of us. And we live in a country where everyone is given equal rights to their beliefs, ideals, and way of life. Also, those who claim to be Christians, should remember that the greatest is love.  So let us not forget kindness then towards all, and let us rise up and help our Muslim neighbors to succeed, as we want to succeed, in this world. So be it.

      === Headline News === Long live the King   urlLink http://www.workingforchange.com/article.cfm?ItemID=17139   Long live the King   Geov Parrish WorkingForChange.com   On last week's test case of the PATRIOT Act -- in which a jury resoundingly vindicated a University of Idaho student, but only after our government destroyed his life   Last week, at the same time that John Ashcroft was busy in D.C. declaring to Congress that the President was above the law, a jury in Idaho did its best to rein in the excesses of the PATRIOT Act. And failed.  The case in question was that of Sami Omar Al-Hussayen, a University of Idaho graduate student and Saudi national accused of terrorism under the PATRIOT Act. Last year, in February 2003, an FBI SWAT team descended on the sleepy college town of Moscow, Idaho, raiding Al-Hussayen's home and  hauling him off. Al-Hussayen was charged with three counts of terrorism, four counts of making false statements, and seven counts of visa fraud.  Al-Hussayen, the son of a former Saudi education minister, was a Ph.D. candidate who had studied in the US for nine years. A husband and father, he hardly fit the profile of terrorist, and the town rallied behind him -- particularly when the details of his case emerged. He had volunteered his time to a Michigan-based group, the Islamic Assembly of North America, to set up a website that promoted the study of Islam. The website contained a link to another website set up by a group the US government had listed as a terrorist organization. Another link pointed to a site that, among a huge volume of postings, contained four short documents written by radical clerics discussing the war in Chechnya and the conflict in Palestine. One of these documents sanctioned suicide attacks and mentioned flying airplanes into buildings.  That was it. Al-Hussayen was charged as a tertiary "terrorist" -- giving help to a group whose web site linked to a group that published, among its library of documents, writings that advocated terror. Al-Husaayen's case did not even amount to an assault on freedom of speech, because he hadn't been the one speaking; indeed, he didn't even know the links and documents were on the site. The visa violations and false statement charges against Al-Hussayen involved his work with a nonprofit organization; his visa lists him as a student, and the government claimed that a student visa did not  allow volunteer "work."  Al-Hussayen's case was a major test of a provision in the USA PATRIOT Act that targets so-called "secondary players" in the war on terrorism -- those who give aid to groups or individuals who later carry out terrorist attacks.  Even under such provisions, the case against Al-Hussayen was exceedingly tenuous. It didn't matter. He spent nearly a year and a half in jail before being acquitted by a federal jury last week. The case against him was so thin that his lawyers called only one witness, former CIA Near East division chief Frank Anderson, who testified about terrorist recruitment methods and questioned the FBI's notion that people give up their jobs and family connections to go join a jihad in Chechnya or Palestine after simply reading a few postings on the Internet.  After Al-Hussayen's acquittal, Anderson said, "I take satisfaction in the verdict. But I am embarrassed and ashamed that our government has kept a decent and innocent man in jail for a very long time."  But it was a little more than that. A major test case of the PATRIOT Act was rebuffed, but the government accomplished what it wanted: destroying a life as an example to other foreign nationals in the U.S. Al-Hussayen's wife and children have been deported, his studies interrupted, his friends and associates alienated, and his liberty and sense of personal security taken completely away from him. How many other foreign nationals, living or studying or working in the U.S., will take comfort from the fact that he was acquitted -- and how many will take this and other cases as a warning to step very, very carefully in The Land of the Free?  In all likelihood, Al-Hussayen himself will return to Saudi Arabia, to rejoin his wife and children and rebuild his life. And in all likelihood, John Ashcroft's men will prosecute more PATRIOT Act cases with little or no substance in the future -- secure in the knowledge that, just as they consider their Commander-in-Chief above the law, the law itself can be used to harass innocent people, and nothing will be lost.  Nothing, that is, except our tax dollars, a few innocent lives, and the notion of liberty that we're supposedly defending in our War On Terror. A jury struck down a PATRIOT Act prosecution, resoundingly, but the government won anyway. The king is dead. Long live the king. === End Headline News ===

      In a recent  urlLink post  on  urlLink volconvo , Samildanach raises an  urlLink interesting idea . The gist of it is that we all have neural energy that is transmitted and recieved from our bodies; that this neural  urlLink tx / urlLink rx  creates an ad-hoc network that transmits, possibly subconciously, our knowledge; that we consiously make use of the information gained from the network.  He is an athiest and tends to lean towards the fact that this network could be what we call 'god'. However that shouldn't discredit the idea. In fact I believe that the idea discredits any thought of God not existing.  I must also add that I've thought a bit about this same idea (proof of concept[?]), and I plan on collecting my thoughts and wrapping them around this for a bit. I will post them later.  What are your thoughts?

      The spin started this morning. Now they are trying to spin Saddam's comments off as a gimmick to help George W. Bush lose this election!   That's insane, media speculation at best. However it is how they have dressed it up and fed it to the American people. Expect a lot more of it.  The effect of a barrage of this will be to weaken the American people to caring what is done to him. In the end, they will accept any injustice done to him or any in relations to him.   I don't like what he's supposedly done to his people, but who's to say he's not the dupe (far flung stretch of imagination there). We will never really know for sure if there is not a fair trial. And there's more at stake than just that. If this gets treated the way I feel it is going to, then it has heavy implications for the future of justice in  all  of Iraq; for every individual living in Iraq who could or could not be guilty of something.  The problem starts with the idea of the tribunal. This is a trial by judges with no jury. This tribunal is set up much like the French system: you have a separate judge that strictly gathers evidence to prove the guilt, the other judges judge on the matter, and the defendants attorney has the burden of proof towards his innocence.   Now many people have disagreed with this, but to me it is all semantics. Here's the truth about it. This court system means proven guilty, until proven innocent. Now the point that people say is that you have the judge that gathers the proof for guilt and that makes it fair. However, I would like those people to notice that the Judge's word bears the authority of being right, always! His proof cannot be questioned except in reference of proof that the Defendant is innocent. So you really have to struggle against the Judges proof to even get a chance. what you have is an unbalanced trial; the judge of evidence having the controlling hand already declaring the defendants guilt, unquestionably.  In America, a trial by jury, with a prosecutor and a defendant, on equal ground, having to both bear the burden of proof, is an equal, fair, and just trial. Out forefathers were tired of lopsided trials. To many innocents lives were ruined from tribunals. Freedom was the casualty of such trials. That is why we have an un-infringe-able right to Habeus Corpus and trial by jury.  In other words, it's not Saddam's fate that is at stake here; it is Iraq's freedom which is being threatened by the so called liberators of the Iraqis.  Stupid insurgents, hold still while we finish forging another link to your countries chain!

      This was just a quick post I ran across that pretty much sums up my feelings of the days coming up to and following the Libertarian convention.  --- Post from http://blog.badnarik.org/ --- LIBERTY DOLLAR NEWS: June 2004 Vol. 6 No. 6  I Have Gone Political!  Do you vote? Would you if you knew and trusted the candidate? Well I have never voted in my life. Not wanting to be a party to the current political cesspool, I was quite a smug with my attitude that I would not vote unless I "knew" the candidate and actually "trusted" him. And as I thought that was quite impossible, I was quite resolved that I would never vote! After all, how could it ever come about that these two requirements could ever be met? Well, the most unlikely event has happened and I am now registering to vote for the first time! And this event was so profound for me that I am asking you to also consider the impossible. I am asking you to help me elect Michael Badnarik President of the United States!   I know this sounds crazy. I know all the arguments about throwing away my vote, etc, etc. But I also know and trust Michael Badnarik. He has met my criteria and I hope he will meet yours.     [More:]   Recently I manned the booth at the Libertarian Party National Convention in Atlanta for the Liberty Dollar. Normally I would not "waste my time" doing such a thing. But this year was different.  This year Michael Badnarik, my friend and fellow Liberty Associate, was a candidate for nomination to be the Party's Presidential Candidate. And as he had devoted the past year to campaigning for the opportunity to serve our great country, I had to show my support. Did he have a chance? H*ll no! He and his traveling companion Jon Airheart, another friend and fellow Associate, drove around in an old car, sending out urgent requests for $5 or maybe even $10 to get to the next event. Did they have any money? No. Like most of our Founding Fathers they had little more than a dream and the determination to do their best. In addition to the meager funds raised, Michael taught his "Constitution Class". But as the strict Constitutionalist that he is, he only accepted "real" money.   That's right! He only accepted Liberty Dollars. And no, students could not just trade their d*mn FRNs for Liberty Dollars with Michael and then pay. No they had to get their Liberty Dollars on their own, often many students' first pro Constitutional act.   Over the year, Michael made a good showing. He polished his presentation. Won the praise of everyone. Even the two other candidates, Aaron Russo and Gary Nolan acknowledged Michael's firm dedication to the principles that the President required to uphold. Relentless, in face of the other candidate's big names, bigger campaign budgets, and even managers, Michael crusaded towards the election at Atlanta.   When I arrived in Atlanta, it was no secret that everybody loved Michael and respected his spirit. Nor was it any secret that he did not have a prayer in h*ll of winning the nomination. After all, who is Michael Badnarik?! He arrived in an old car. Did not even book a room for his campaign, and if the truth was known, he probably didn't even have the money. But there was no stopping this guy. For him, like George Washington, there was no alternative to winning in spite of its unlikeliness.   The night before the Presidential Candidate election, there was a debate scheduled. It seemed of no major importance. All three candidates had their respective replies fine-tuned and nobody expected much. One would think it was to be just another debate, like so many over the past year of campaigning. No, that was not the case. Face to face with Aaron Russo and Gary Nolan, Michael stole the show. He was strong, witty, direct in his replies, and relied if not quote the Constitution to half the questions. Michael stole the hearts of everyone, except for the most hardcore Russo and Nolan supports. People came up to me and exclaimed how good Michael was and that they were now going to vote for Michael! My God, my friend might get elected?!   The next day was the election. Many of the state delegates had promised to vote Russo or Nolan on the first vote. Well as it turned out the first vote was nothing more than removing miscellaneous nominees from the ballot. The second ballot was between the three serious candidates. Russo, with the big name, lots of honors and money, was the assumed winner. Many felt there was no need to vote! I don't recall the figures, but Nolan was eliminated and Michael made it to the finals! Amazing!   Almost immediately, someone rose to the microphone and moved to set aside the convention rules (which was common throughout the day)and allow Gary Nolan to speak for five minutes as he was a serious candidate that had spent so much time and money. The motion was quickly seconded and passed unanimously. Nolan came to the podium and quickly thanked his supporters. And equally quickly told all the state delegates that if they voted for him vote for Badnarik! The Badnarik crowd went wild! All this time I was expecting some kind of upset. Some secret candidate to win. I had never considered that my friend might actually win!   Luckily, while the state delegates where counting their votes between Russo and Badnarik, I saw Michael on the floor just as he was saying goodbye to someone. He was alone. Just standing there. I grabbed his arm briskly and gave him a really big hug as he turned around. I literally whispered in his ear, "Michael, you better get ready you are really going to be running for President of the United States."  It was foxhole mentality. The air was electric. Volleys of "We like Mike." And "Russo, Russo." flew overhead. We parted with tears in our eyes. Within five minutes the votes were in and Michael, against all odds, became the Seabiscuit of this Presidential election for the Libertarian Party.   We the People, now have a real candidate. Now we need to elect him! I don't care if you have never voted. Nor have I! I care about our country and its god-awful money and the price we will be paying after the election if either Bush or Kerry is elected. Yes I know that Bush has raised $210 MILLION - there are not that many voters!!!  And Kerry has raised $170 MILLION! And that is more than voters too!But it is like Michael says, when you vote for the lesser of two evils, YOU STILL GET EVIL.   Lets put the force of the Internet behind Michael. If you have an e-mail list, if you are techno savvy then give Michael some publicity. Note the secret weapon article below. Lets make his candidacy the buzz on the Internet. It costs nothing but a bit of your time! Don't let Dumb and Dumber debate without Michael! He will steal the show, just like he did in Atlanta and Kennedy did in 1960 against Nixon. Michael, aka "Seabiscuit", can win this election as a dark horse IF the people elect him. Tired of the same old government? Just this once, get out of the box when you get in the voting booth and VOTE BADNARIK! --- End Post ---
