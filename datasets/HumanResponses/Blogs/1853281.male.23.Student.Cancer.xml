      graaar Pansy Division was so much fun. They are hilarious and put on a great show, though the amount of old gay men was sort of frightening, never thought to see so many queers at first ave, especially middle aged one. It was rather funny though, i went to this band that sings about dick with four lesbians, kinda the story of my life though, can't escape the lesbians. Did not go to the going away party, chickened out. I want school to start. I am sick of sitting around with nothing to do. I hate empty time.  I did not bring home an achingly beautifull punk rocker, or indeed, any punk rocker, but i had a great time with jim beam and Mr. Newcastle and was not dissapointed.

      Is there any better breakfast than a pint and a rueben at 11:00 am? I don't bloody think so.  On the agenda for the day: work dinner with the moms maybe drop in at a going away party for a teacher i used to have a crush on, maybe not. They'll be lots of strange and scary grad students,some of them may have been TA's of mine Going to see Pansy Division Maybe bring home some achingly beautifull queer punk rocker? If not, plenty of fun in Beam and Water's  If only the rest of my weekend was shaping up to be so much fun.

      so here is the first post of this blog thing. My own contribution to the mountains of banalities spewed out everyday. I am finally joining the ranks of the computer savvy. Well. I can barely contain my excitement. School starts on tuesday, and i will enter the hell that is a fifth year junior history major.

      wote a paper on yeats last night, even though it is not due until thursday, am reading ahead in my other classes, and have not turned in one late assignment. Life is strange indeed. been thinking about josh a lot yesterday, had a great conversation with f. at pandoras last night about life etc, in between bouts of homework. Think i know what is going on with that now, at least, i know what i want now. (If you want to know that, you'll have to e-mail me and ask) found out i am on the vip list for thursday, first time that's happened, and i am excited to see a free show. cheers devin

      the weekend went to Dad's friday night, awkward throughout the whole evening, but we chatted a lot saturday morning, one of our lets rip everything in the world to shreds and rebuild it the "right" way conversations. than we went to Dodo's house, i admit I was a bit nervous. Heidi and her kids did not make it, but i got to meet Enid and Basil, my neice and nephew whom i had never met, and my sister(half-sister)Dede whom i hadn't seen in fifteen or sixteen years. It was very nice, did not get enough time to talk to dede, but we exchanged e-mail adressses, so i think we will stay in contact.  Sunday i went to brunch with Josh, whom i still have a crush on. I do think he is attractive, yes, but he is really just a cool guy, and interesting to talk to . He can make me laugh. After that went home and worked on a paper that was due today, francesca came over, i finished my paper and cleaned a bit while she studied, than we went to pandora's and read for a little bit. today: turned in my paper, work is super busy, will be writing another paper tonight. cheers

      so tonight i go down to see my Dad. He is 80 and lives in a very small village an hour and a half south of the cities, which, since i don't drive is rather a difficult place to get to. I am, however, blessed with a mother who is willing to take me to jordan, where Papa meets us(he cannot really drive in the city anymore,bad for his heart.) I feel bad, but i hate going there, i hate seeing how old he is getting, how feeble, how resigned to death. Saturday i am going with him to his first ex-wive's house for dinner. Two of my hal-sisters will be there with their children. One sister i have not seen in like three years, same with her two boys. The other i have not seen since i was six, so like 16 years or so. I have never met her daughter and son. I am not really looking forward to it. I tried so damn hard for years to try and get to know them, to try and be a part of their lives, etc. etc. but was contsantly rebuffed. I have no desire to even try anymore, too much time has gone by, and they never thought of me as family anyways.  It should be an interesting encounter.  God i hope there is some wine with dinner cheers

      so today is monday.  saturday: after shopping, playing games with my mom and keith, and than some aunties (h. and L.) came over, they were staying with mom for the weekend. They brought me some newcastle, which of course i had to drink. 4 bottles worth.  Yesterday...punk rock brunch at the T-rock with coffee and bloody's(i have to wake up , and take care of the hangover from the night before) talking of Boots and fetishes. An aborted trip to the smitten Kitten which was closed, than studying at Bobs for like four hours or so. (I got to wear my hot new red boots) and then home where i sat on my couch, in the midst of my filth and crocheted while i watched pbs shows on nature. I am so going to end up with 40 cats and a neighborhood of children scared of me. woke up this morning two hours and twenty minutes after my alarm should have gone off, but it did not. Managed to get to class just in time. Payed my tuition, and than went to lecture, where hot guy i had a crush on last fall was all like "come sit by me" and then awkwardness and stuff. So hot though...mmmmmm tyler...mmmmm. cheers devin

      went shopping with Mom today, the traditional ding dong weekend. Got a pair of jeans, a pair of chinos for work and five pairs of shoes. Is that excessive, i have basically doubled the amount of shoes that i have.  I so rarely get to indulge my inner imelda marcos, but i did, including buying this great pair of red doc martin boots. Not sure where i will wear red doc martins, but i am sure that i will make sure that i do. Besides i just read that every man will need a pair of red shoes for next season, so i am so avant guard.

      last night. First some studying at Bob's, than a glass of wine at barbette, than went to the eagle with F. and it was not terrifying, as i had been led to expect. Just a pretty chill bar with very strong very cheap drinks. We chatted for like an hour and a half with this cat, S. He seemed nice, bought us a round, so of course i would think him nice. Very suave. Of course i had no balls and did not give him my number, when i finally decided i was brave enough he had slipped out the back. Oh well, don't think he was at all interested, but nice conversation. I should be cleaning my house right now but am nursing a very bad hangover and am trying to both rehydrate and drink enough coffee to wake up. I have to be well by 3:00 when i go shopping with my mother. Nothing else going on.

      so I like rain i like chilly i do not like rain and chilly when i am dressed for mildly warm and humid. why did it have to be sunny and warm when i was dressing today(which happened without coffee, as i was running late as i got up, decided to skip school and went back to bed, felt guilty and got up, showered rinsed repeated for at leat 45 minutes meaning i had 15 minutes to get ready for the day) On the upside i did go to school. Downside, i had to go to school. I love the whole laying in bed staring at the cieling not being asleep at 2:00 in the morning thing i've got going. Give me some speed and a toothbrush, and there would be no dirty grout in the metro area. time to go home, Maybe some of the books i ordered from amazon(which has now made me her bitch) will have arrived. cheers devin

      okay So I went to class tonight, listened to the other students bitch about the teacher, giggled at the proff's dry humor which no one else noticed, and watched in horror as some girl decided to dumb the class down and get us embroiled in a fruitless conversation for twenty minutes. It's a night class, we don't have time to talk. Let the proff lecture!! I swear, sometimes i want to ban dumb people from my college. Especially the large amounts of dumb people who turn my history classes into excercises in frustration. Went to Annies with Keith afterward and drown my sorrows in chicken fingers and a hot fudge sundae only had two or three spoons of the sundae, dairy so does not even taste good anymore.  Been home for 2 and a half hours, not sleepy. this insomnia this is so played out. I really need the sleep, i need to get up and to class tomorrow. I need to clean my house, which has suddenly morphed ino the pit of death, I almost broke my ankle tripping over three books which were covered with random knitting and then a pizza box. listened to tonight Magnetic Fields 63 love songs volume 2 Kylie Minogue Ella Fitzgerald The Smiths- Louder than Bomb and Orff- Carmina Burana Time to got to sleep.

      why is it that tonight i will guzzle some coffee, smoke a pack of cigarettes(of which i have had none so far, perhaps that is why i am in a foul mood) do the crossword, go to class, chat with a friend and than go to sleep? Where are the drunken revelries? WHat happened to doing lines off a boy whore's ass? where did the excitement go? I am leaving work now, can't decide if i want to drink before class, and after or just before bitter as usual cheers

      I had forgotten to talk about the staple the staple? you say. Yes, the staple i found in a bowl of rice, allowing F. and i to eat fine Indian food for the price of two beers. I am not naming the place, as they were nice and hooked us up, the food was good, and i really think this was a rare type of mishap, but free dinners, what could be nicer. missed school this morning. Slept through both my alarm and the herd of waterbuffalo that live upstairs. It begins again. I will never win perfect attendance.  Am officially a regular at the tower. The servers called f. and i regulars. I hope that does not make us as scary as the other regulars. I am meeting K. tonight after my night class for an annie's evening of the sort we have not had in years. It will be nice to catch up with him, haven't beenseeing him much recently because of school. All i have been seeing alot is F. because we study together, and she makes me leave my house so that i actually study. Thanks to her i haven't fallen behind. well, back to work cheers

      Hmmm I am not sure what is going on. I am not in the greatest of mental states, I seem to be a wee bit depressed, but I am going to school, doing my work, not drinking alot, alone, like i did last year. Probably best for my liver and my pocket book that i am not going through a bottle of Jim Beam a week by myself. Thanks to all of my friends, I think that i am actually functioning despite being depressed, as opposed to my past track record of crashing and burning. Thank you everyone who listens to me moan and makes me laugh and keeps me smiling cheers devin

      weekend: friday night went out to supper with the lesbian moms, and than a hour or two of conversation with them on my porch about school(they both are in grad school) and politics, etc. Than homework and housework. Saturday: studied at bobs, lunch at quangs, walk to the library, than a weird fit of crying at home, followed by homework and housework. Sunday. Homework and housework, the leaning tower, Bob's, long long conversation about life, death, depression and me with a friend. One of those conversations that really lift a burden off your shoulders. enjoyed the weather no end. cheers

      feeling better finished class, went home than went to Bob's to try and get some studying done. Ended up being distracted by a cute boy, and than they turned on the TV. Went home, finished the homwork and watched a dvd i got from amazon in the mail yesterday. Amazon, you are the devil, such a sweet sweet devil. Too little sleep once again, though i went to both of my classes, despite being sorely tempted to ditch my american history for dummies, freshman level even though it is listed as a upper-division, bright faced, ultra pc teacher, class. My good deed for the day feel like i should say something in honor of the day, not sure what to say except give peace a chance, or something equally cliche. Go read something by the dalai lama. Sit for a few minutes and try and figure out why you are motivated to do things. Be kind.  I'm sounding like the hippy i used to be gotta get back to tthe vital task of opening mail cheers

      so things with school are fast deteriorating. Skipped a lecture today and am debating weather or not to go to my night class. I am tired, and sick, i had trouble breathing last night, and slept only intermittently. (still not quitting smoking, though) and i am bitchy and angry because i thought i was going to have some drinks and get a ride home after my night class, but now i have to sneak out of class 15 minutes early to catch the bloody buggery bus and if i miss it it will take me like 60 mins to get to where the express does in like 10. so yeah, must be that time of the month for me or something. I knew growing up with lesbians would do something strange to me. incoherant entry i know, but i am so not feeling well, and i want coffee. I am tired sick, and that is never a plus. maybe i will visit my coffee shope tonight before class, and get my homework for tomorrow done. and than go to class. Maybe they'll actually be some customers now that school has been in session long enough for the students to discover it. Maybe i ditch for reasons of illness and go straight home where i will lay on the couch amd bemoan the fact there is no one to come over and take care of me, get me soup, rub my head, tell me I'm pretty. Maybe i will jump on a train and ride the rails into a pretty future of prostitution and heroin. maybe i will meet the man of my dreams who will sweep me off my feet and we'll move to europe and live the bohemian lifestyle, but with luxury. Maybe nothing will happen, i will get half my homework done, and stare resentfully at my teacher, counting the seconds until my class is done

      saw Nico this morning whilst i was smoking before class, i looked over and he was walking toward me. I nodded and than had to giggle at how hard he ignored that i existed. What a freak. It is so weird because i have not thought about him for months and months, and than he comes up in a conversation last night, and than i see him today. so weird

      yaar, the leaning tower is so my bar. Just got back from having a pint and some with F. It seems to be a tuesday night thing. I came home, did some crazy amount of reading and than went and got a drink and tried to not flirt with hottie mc hot waiter. He knows what i drink etc. WHat could be better. Newcastle is a god, and dirty stoli (or tanqueray) and tonics with extra dirty and an two olives is seriously paradise on earth. so good. Have to run to bed or i will be a bitch in my class tomorrow morning.

      enough whining lunched today at this crazy 50's buisiness man diner downtown, Pete's grill. Scary all american basic food. Our waitress looked like she had been with the place since it opened, and smelled like nursing home. I had a patty melt, peach cobbler, coffee, and talked politics and the economy with a friend. I am oficially 40. I don't know what to think about school except that i am busy and i like all but one of my classes. It's allready the second week, and i have not developed any obsessive crushes, and i have actually been doing my homework. I must be growing up. I did ditch my first class of the school year, though. I had to. I can't stand this class, but can't drop it either. It's a huge class, and he does not take attendance. I do the readings, Fine, I'll go next time!!! (Can you tell i feel guilty, though not too much as i could not have had said lunch if i had not ditched. Well, back to work, and the glorious world of a paper monkey

      weekend friday i have no school and had the day off from work. I had brunch with becca and lauren. They are fun, and we are so different from highschool it is weird, and makes me feel old. and smile.  did some power thriftshopping on saturday. Buying clothes by the pound is so fun, though the enourmous tab at the triple rock afterwards was not so much fun, though worth it. Sunday was a housewife day, with laundry and cleaning and than watching part of children of dune with keith. He hasn't read the books and i resent explaining, so there was alot of bitch face going around, but it was goodnatured. Leto atreides and prince faradn, graar, there is some yummy scenery. now back to the grindstone, so much homework, and some that i forgot about this weekend. Allready behind(sort of)

      yaaaaaaaaar no wonder i always call my liquor. Well vodka does bad things to your head the next day(a rarity for me). But on the upside i did get one half price because the server decided i should be included in the ladies night special at the Tower.  Nightclass, interesting yet dry. Kinda standard upper level real academia focused class. Interesting though. I like it. I can see allready though, that i am going to be living at Bob's and maybe Spyhouse studying. I have a grand total of 7 papers to write this semester, along with presentations, reflections, debates, and a hefty dose of daily reading. Actually when i write it out it does not seem so much. But i will be busy enough.

      second day at school was much better(so far at least, have not had my nightclass yet) British history, origins to 1600 or so. My T.A. is this kick ass english phd candidate who went back to school after fifteen years in the real world. He makes me think of a better looking(sort of hot, in an english way) version of micheal palin. The professor is some dougie howser phd candidate who looks like a highschooler in a suit, but he seems knowledgable.  I am so happy, my favorite online journal is back. Everyone should check it out at thesouthlondondiaries.co.uk no better understanding of the humor and sadness of this world we live in.l Plus drew is just plain funny

      forgot how much fun dancing for hours with friends could be, definitly better than sex, at least the sex i have been having. Oh am i sore though, my knee(the one that tells the weather) was not working yesterday, and today my legs were rubber. classes began semester is shaping up to be hell the two classes i have had so far have the professors i loathe. My british lit class is run by a verbally incontinent eccentric. His sentances have an odd cadence as he emphasizes certain words with no reason. His voice moves from a whisper to a shout in the same word, and he seems more concerned with assuring the students of his own profundity and vast experience of travel than he does with teaching us. What an ass. My other professor, in my early 20th cent american history class, oh god, he is so earnest and excited. I wonder if he has taught much before. And, the horror, he is treating this upper level course as if it were a 1000 level survey, and assuming the students are complete idiots. He is going to have a writing tutor come in to help us with our papers for god's sake! Don't take a 38000 level course if you can't write a paper and don't know what a primary document is. oh god what an idiot

      okay,  so i got another paper assignment. I need to cry. Well, not really cry but just whine for a few sentances, just a few, i promise. I am never going to have any free time at all, all i am going to do is to do research for the buggery papers and presentations. Gaaaah. Okay, I'm Done. In other news, i am feeling much better this morning, due i think to not going to school yesterday, and laying in bed watching movies. I watched Querelle, The Pillow Book, and Titus Andronicus. They all combined to give me some rather odd dreams last night where the location was actually a character and all i did was walk around commenting on the design of the places i was in. Pretty weird, and i know that i am not explaining that at all well. Than had my reoccuring dream where i am sleeping in someones arms, and than i woke up and felt really alone, more alone than usual. I think my subconscious might be saying i am ready to put myself out there again, which is good because my mind and my...uh...other mind have been saying that for weeks:) So, time to get out there and meet people, but i am suddenly aware that i am no good at meeting people, and haven't the faintest idea how to do so. I have always been set up or met people online(which i will never do again). So Anysuggestions? cheers devin

      i was snowing on saturday as we left gameworks. It was cold but not too cold, we were all a little drunk but not tooo drunk(except f. who was not at all drunk) and we caught snowflakes on our tongues at 12:30 am downtown while waiting for the light to change and watching cars go by. Magical, well, not really, but pretty damn cool and all symbolic and stuff. It was the kind of scene indie filmakers put in their films. Oh, and F. called me emo when we were trying to figure out what stereotypes everyone fitted in. Funny, never would have called myself emo. oh well done

      so. friday, went to  urlLink party monster   with f. it was pretty cool, though Maculey Culkin and Seth Green do gay way too well, than home. I watched russian ark and this other flick which name i cannot recall but it was a depressing movie about a gay man and his first love and how nothing ever works out and sadness etc... so i was allready in a great mood. While i did this i drank. A lot. Alone. And cried. Not the best night, but i think i needed it as i felt much better afterwards, and sometimes i think i need times like that to cathartically(is that a word) get rid of all the stress and sadness that gets stored up because i don't really epress it that well. saturday. did laundry, met f. at pandoras and studied, quangs for lunch and than f. and i cuddled and watche d center stage. I love that flick so much. than went to gameworks for a's birthday, pretty fun even though i am not really into the whole video game thing, especially enjoyed the bowling. we saw d. there, that was nice, than just like hung out at my house for a while sunday, laundry and cleaning until tyler woke up and i could finally vacum, than real cleaning and than homework and movies etc. Did not get out of my pyjamas all day. Perfect. got my british history paper back today, b plus, not bad, though not as good as i had wanted. thats all i think cheers

      So I have  urlLink Sars   . Headache, fever, hacking cough, all that jazz. That is cool. It would be cooler if i had consumption, than i could write poetry in a dark garret while remaining ever mindfull of my approaching mortality. Or maybe rickets... or scurvy again Argh matey!!  in other news i emailed my new favorite sci fi author, well, basically my new favorite author period,  urlLink Alastair Reynolds  and he so e-mailed me back. I am way to excited about this. Almost as excited that i am now fitting into smaller pants. Hooray. Tonight i am going to a play about mathew shepard at mctc. I think. I am not quite sure if i will go yet. Otherwise am looking forward to the weekend and glad all my midterms are done. I got my medieval cities midterm back, an a- ah yeah baby!! cheers d

      the show was okay. I got plastered though, and than had to go to my dentists appointment still drunk the next morning.  that was fun, though not as fun as having a hangover start at three in the afternoon, at work. friday went to Pracna for S's going away party, saturday was b-day dinner for my mom, and than met some friends at Tiburon. I liked it there, and it was really nice to see D again, had been a while. Went to Bolt and the Eagle afterward with F. and A., too crowded for me, and there was no chemistry with the guy F. introduced me to. thank back to the grindstone, with a surprise call on monday which meant i got a roomate.

      so i have a roomate now he is moving in on friday not sure what to say. I never thought i would really do it and get one, but i did, so i guess it really was time for a change. I am really loathing the whole broke-can't-spend-any-money thing. school is going that is all i can really say, got b minuses on two papers, and i am rather peeved at that. have a revised paper due wednesday, so i have to revise it tonight, should not take too long, and than i will need to start clearing out the office, which will be tylers room. otherwise, the weather is nice, and i get to wear my hot leather jacket. I am ten pounds lighter than the last time i weighed myself(like a month ago) nothing else new cheers

      so this morning was like the fourth or fifth time i have been divebombed by urlLink lady bugs  which are a real problem in mn this year  in other news going to  urlLink Death Cab for Cutie  tonight, i am very excited, even more so because i get to wear a new shirt.l Too bad i am too broke to drink, though i might steal some cash from the checking account, but then i have to get up early for the dentist, and it all is really messy. I probably won't drink, though it is all ages, and i am not sure that i can handle the junior highers. i don't know. oh well my cheek still hurts, but i want it taken care of.  F. wants to introduce me to a guy this weekend, and that is not going to happen if i have a swollen face. no other real news than that cheers

      so i have been unbelievable productive both at home and with my schoolwork, haven't fallen behind, have been doing my homework etc. it's really strange, woke up this morning at 6:00 and managed to : fold and put away basket of clean laundry. Put away all the clothes scattered in my room, ditto with the three glasses and the 15 books. Do some dishes, read a chapter for school, make breakfast and pack a lunch and still have time to get myself pretty and ready for the day. All before 9:20 am. Scary. Other news. I am going to the dentists on friday so that they can look at my scary gum thing. I don't know what happened, but my cheek is starting to swell, and it is starting to hurt pretty much all the time. Time i got it looked at i think. wish me luck on my midterm tonight cheers devin

      the weekend thursday night went to see the hot hot heat. I had a lot of fun, drank way to much, and stumbled home rather late.  Up early on friday for a 4 hour car ride to wisconsin with jannie. roamed over the land from 3 till like 7, than built a fire, and sat watching it, feeling uncomfortable with the darkness and the woods, than a ten minute walk back to the car feeling like a bad extra from the blair witch porject. Talked to my aunt and uncle for like a half hour and than to bed. saturday: up at eight, by nine helped run the splitter, that broke down so helped unload that truckfull of wood while jannie and jill stacked it. Proceded to continue unloading trucks of wood until 7:30 pm. Ow. Really ow. I have bruises and could not walk the next day. Sunday: painfull carride back, than just sitting on my couch, groaning every time i had to move, and wishing i had some one to rub my sore muscles. Not writing the paper i was supposed to. so tonight, writing that damn paper

      so, ran into a friend i have not seen in like 6 years or so yesterday, it was weird, as i don't really think about that part of my life that much anymore, and it really struck me how little i remember. How embarrasing. Am going to a show tonight, the Hot Hot Heat, which should be fun, and before that am meeting f for drinks, she wants to go to the local, but i am going to lobby for seeing hal ( hal's our pal) as we can probably get more for our money. I am really looking forward to going out, i have not in soo long, and i think it has been over a week since i had a drink, no wonder my liver feels so healthy. Well, nuts to you liver, i am going to have some fun tonight!! Holiday, Celebrate and all that jazz. Will be gone this weekend in wisconsin with jannie. We're going to see the land and to help with the wood bee, where a lot of the family get together to split and stack enough wood to heat the farmhouse for the winter. What joy is mine. I'll ruin my hands. Oh well. It'll be nice to get a good ramble over the land in, see what trees have been blown down, and all the lovely fall colors. Maybe even get in some canoeing, though i'm not sure about that.  anywho cheers devin

      sleep deprivation and happiness have conspired to make me the most hyperactive little fag right now. Sooo fun. Tonight is outkast inklusion  at the T. Rock, which should be a blast. Lots of Queers listening to good punk and rock and drinking. Hooray. R. and i will get to hang out with everyone, and they can see us together and be disguted at the sweetness. So fun. Was supposed to do research today, but both of my papers are now delayed(legitimately), so i hung out at my coffee shop, played solitaire, went to the thrift shop and bought some stuff--a fly coat, a hat and the hotest wool pants, they are almost indecent in how they cling. Yay. Have been e-mailing a lot with my sister D. and we are developing a nice relationship which i am happy for. She is really cool , and really supportive of my life. It is really nice. Strange tho, i was always raised as an only child, and now i really do feel that i have a sibling. Well, anything else i write will be too incoherent to read due to my sleepiness, so Happy Thanksgiving everyone cheers d

      It's amazing how much life can change in a very short time, i started the weekend as the bitter single fag, and ended it with a boyfriend and a perky cheerfull outlook. (I wonder if i'll get my bitter back, or if i want to) Friday night I went to the marq to meet P. and this guy he thought I should meet, R. That started a 14 and 1/2 hour long date. Tee Hee:) Than Saturday R. and I went to A. and A's housewarming party and were the most disgustingly cute couple ever. So fun, so cute. I've been grinning the whole weekend and totally feel utterly, utterly highschool. We had so much fun being th totally faggy cool kids, it was great. Party was so much fun. That's my news, as to the weather, no matter how cold and snowy it is, in the mood i am in right no it will feel sunny and tropical:)

      Oh my how trite, but i could not resist. Life has calmed a lot. No longer running around frantically from homework to show to bar to homework. I miss it. Now i am reclining on the couch and becoming better aqainted with the ass groove in the loveseat while i watch too much television and lament the weather and my wilting social life. The shins sucked, went to go see them on friday, but they stopped taking comps whilst we were in line, it was ass crowded with junior high bobbysoxers on the first floor, and with twentysomthing hipsters(who were remarkably attractive in the main) on the mezzaine. I immediatly felt that i was going to sick up, from the crowd, the haze of ciggarett smoke, the half bottle of wine and three hal drink i had had earlier, and, no doubt, from the stench of unwashed preteen rising towards me. The sound was awfull and we left after four or five songs and watched charlies angels two instead. Saturday i met jannie and my aunt and two small cousins downtown to look at marshall feilds eighth floo(washed out colors and weak imagery) and than wander through the skyways looking at everything. I have had better times, but it was nice to see them nonetheless. yesterday i just read and cleaned, read and cleaned. cheers

      the show on friday was great, i could have done withough sweet J.A.P. but the rapture was so much fun and i had to shake my booty. Saturday i had to be in the library and sunday to do homework, but i had a good weekend. Monday and tuesday have been a blur of writing my late papers and trying to make sure they get in on time.  I did. Was walking through the skyway today when the rain was falling but starting to turn into snow and i overheard a buisiness type say "oh shit. It's visible rain. Where did you park." for some reason this really cracked me up. Who says visible rain? why not hail or ice or sleet or snow or any of the thousands of words we say here. Why visible rain? I don't know, but that cracked my shit up. Had lunch with my lesbian wife at pete's grill. Real cracker type minnesota food, beef with buttered noodles, bread pudding with vanilla sauce, and weak black coffee. That combined with the decor and the fact i could smoke made me feel as if i had been transported back to the 50's. The waitress looked like she had been there since the twenties. Seriously, i think she must be older than my dad.  Just over heard a offive mate saying what they liked to drink: a plastic mug half filled with vodka and half filled with diet mountain dew. That is frightening. so frightening. I seem to be surrounded by the burbs, pretty trashy burbs too. What do they eat with that? Squeeze Cheeze and twinkies? Fishsticks? Some sort of casserole with cream of mushroom soup and french fried onions? I don't know. Have to go cheers

      nothing really exciting going on in the world of Devin, though i am cheered by that fact that a favorite website is back after a hiatus of several months, everyone would go check out  urlLink sweet fancy moses   it makes me laugh. I am going to have to spend the weekend immured in the library doing research for two papers due next week, what joy is mine. I also have a dentist appointment early tomorrow morning to get a cavity filled, which i am not looking forward to. I have the dentist.

      I am so freaking excited for tonights party.....it should be a great time, and if not i can always remember what Bob Morris of the New York Times says about   urlLink Regret   and chalk it up to a learning experience. I am very much hoping that people do not follow the practice of people in Hillbrow South Africa and   urlLink throw things  at my party. Oh well. Well see what happens. I have the feeling the turnout will be not too shabby, and so i should have a good time indeed. Got the perfect boots to wears with my dress from J. She is always giving stuff away to people. Very nice of her to do so. everyone should go, it'll be a fabulous time. Just took this quiz and guess who ended up as the gay one. Yes, that is right, moi.  Congratulations! You're Gandalf!    urlLink   Which Lord of the Rings character and personality problem are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    must dash cheers PS. just saw the coolest website, everyone has to go to grouphug.us

I don't quite have to begin preparing for my  urlLink Fabulous New Years Party   (which you all should go to) so i can take a few moments to breathe. And Post. Things are going well. Got my grades back, a b plus and three a minus'. Not too shabby. Things are still great with R., they just seem to get better the more I know him. Work is good, everything is good, tho my credit card has been a little too happy to see me this season, but i had to get presents...right? Have my classes all set up for next semester: Ancient Art History, Habsburg Central Europe, British History Two, and Intro to GLBT studies. Shouldn't be too bad, i hope.

It was so much fun, have not gone sledding in i don't know how long, and drinking and flasking certainly improve the experience. Am really happy that i have my keys again. Had lost them last night and got a callfrom mum this a.m. they were in her door. Everything is going well. Am not quite walking in clouds all schmoopy and lost, but am still grinning. hooray for boyfriends:)

      after a great week of grinning and walking in the clouds i have been rudely drawn back to earth by papers which are due and approaching finals. I am sad to have to re-enter hum drum everydayness, I rather like the exaulted plane people are in during the first flush of attraction. Well, now to building something up under that. Last week went something like this: Two lovers, mindless of their surrounding, walk along the street in a bubble of happiness. Suddenly they both look up and see the snow fall down like a curtain of whiteness, they grab hands and laugh in perfect synchronization at the beauty of the world. For a brief moment they feel like one person. Later, in the bar, their conversation is the only thing that seems real. All their friends recede into the distance, like a video played at a party as background noise. They nudge and touch and lean into each other--It is physically impossible not to touch. They are happy, and somewhat gone from this world.

I have no more smokes and am not going to make any excuses. I am done. Period. as a warning to all my friends and loved ones: I am likely to be crabby and unbelievably irritable for a while...watch your backs. otherwise nothing really new just want to be done with the smoking AND the quitting cheers d

We read left wing materiel while sipping coffee in bed, met another couple at Pandora's, and than grocery shopped together. It was very nice. Spent sat.night with my mother, we had a great talk and watched Too Wong Foo. Than sunday punk rock brunch and an evening at the chatterbox., followed by watching a bbc movie with r. have just read the nasitiest  urlLink article   ever about beef. I doubt i  will be eating commercially produced beef ever again.  Here is one about the U.S. army destroying  urlLink farms  in Iraq. How frigging stupid is it to detroy farms in a country where people are starving and we are trying to "rebuild" following our destructon of it. I mean Please, get a clue. Ah well.

      tuesday night i had a smoke, and said goodbye to M. and A. untill they come back over the summer. Wednesday i wallowed in gloom, and smoked half a pack of ciggarettes. I feel horrible, ill, headachy, and my throat is coated with some nast film. Smoking really is disgusting, but so so sweet. Oh i love the Camels, but they don't love me. Will try and not smoke tonight.  Have been reading all sorts of inspiring things on the net, and my souls is starting to graduallycome back. I want to do all sorts of things like Kill my TV and go veggie and grow things and care about people and effect change etc. It will be interesting to see how long this lasts.

      I might be feeling a little better. Gorged myself on brownies last night while watching "the Scarlet Empress" starring Marlene Dietrich, than curled up with a book and a pot of chamomile tea. Still was too jeezled to sleep until well after midnight, have got to get back to earlier hours. All sorts of pleasant ideas about gardening are filtering through my head, have to get my landlady to let me have some ground. still no cigarette, quite an accomplishment, if I do say so myself. Three days now. Pretty good for me, usually I break after two. Think I might have a glimmer of a soul left, I just have to cultivate it assiduously.

I am feeling all sort of grinch and scrooge and not at all like a productive contributing member of the human race. I need inspiration like this article about   urlLink Eco Punks   or something. I just want to get some of my ideals back, when did i get to heartless and causeless? i have no soul.

      seriously ....it was....i mean, i pity anyone who was not there. I have no idea what turnout was, 40 or so maybe, i think? who knows. 2004 is shaping up to be a great year, starting out with a kiss from my sweetie, great beginning. R. and I were the prettiest girls on the street, though A.'s dress was amazing and her shoes...all i have to say is dangerous(in the best sense of the word) She brought a couple of cats that i knew from Art's High, had not seen them since graduation...seriously this world is just getting smaller. Had brunch at the T-rock than yesterday, great time, ran into a couple of people i know. That F, and M. and Hall helped me clean the post party mess up...thanks you guys, really appreciate it.  sledding tonight at J's and i am fully intending to flask it. decided against resolutions this year...though i do have goals 1. really put an effort in to quitting smoking  by r's birthday, since the two of are are both quitting i am hoping it should be easier. 2. keep up with school 3. budget budget budget I am tempted to add more to the list but that would just set me up for failure Happy New Years Everyone cheers devin

      Yes that is right, I had several smokes. Delicious, satisfying, sexy, wonderfull smokes. I sat in my coffee shop, smoked my ciggarettes, and read the March edition of Vogue(lovely spring modes by the way) knowing that i was the best dressed person in the room...though it is in the dinkydome and i was surrounded by students so that is not saying much. poopie butt...i am a smoker again...

      everybody excited for 40 days of sorrow and penitence? Come on Eh? Eh?  Me neither....Lent blows.  So i am in this intense inner dialogue right now trying to decide if i buy a pack of smokes or not...Can't decide...Does it really matter? In the end i will die anyways....what will quitting smoking really do except prevent me from enjoying two lungfulls of tarry goodness any time i want...FUCK! I want to buy the smokes...i think i will too. I will be in a very smoky coffee shop this afternoon....i have to. D. is going to lend me some movies...I love the fact that i am borrowing foreign movies with a gay theme from a straight middle aged iranian...my life is weird. so, did the pain-a-lates with j dawg last night...it is so hard... though i can do more than when we began...and i don't with i were dead the next day anymore...it is still hard... haven't lost anyweight by the scale(in fact i have gained some) but my clothes are a bit looser. Didn't shave the head last night...didn't trim the hair either....proto-mullet is a little less proto and a little more mullet as every day goes by, and i really don't care...i don't know what to do with the hair. nothing really doing tonight save nightclass... anyways enough babbling

      rushed into school to get this bib done to find that only like three comps work the superdisk thing...get it done, long for a smoke, go to class, long to be smoking....walk to the next class....want to kill for a cigarette, class is boring as hell, play devil's advocate to piss everyone off in response to fowl no smoking attitute, realize i came off as a complete asshole...but a libertarian one...realize i like that....go to work...want some nicotine...fall onto a cookie with a look that made others uncomfortable...revel in chocolate.. that is my day so far. in the future: May get a new used couch instead of my old used couch.  Think i will ask H. out from my GLBT class...any tips? May shave my head tonight...not sure.

      well kids today is the first midterm of the semester...should not be too hard, but keep your fingers crossed. Talked to a proff today about my big paper...got a ton of more sources and it is embarrasing to share just how excited i got from some new places to find journal articles she showed me...i am such a geek. back on the pain-a-lates bandwagon after a weeks hiatus...ouch...and damn....i am so weak, it feels like i am starting over. Thanks, J. for making me finish last night:) Okay, so i swore off this whole internet dating thing, stopped e-mailing people whose profiles i found interesting, and lo and behold someone e-mailed me...having fun with this correspondance.He at least is not the type of person who writes a two line e-mail...so that is fun. been really feeling my vices recently...though have not been indulging them as relentlessly as before, so that is good. started a new story on sunday, i like it, even though i think it might be a tear jerker for some folks as it is rather pathetically sad just now. But don't worry, i have the feeling everything will turn out just right in the end. anyways, off to take a midterm,  cheers d

      so  today is supposed to be unlucky....haven't noticed it yet, but maybe i am tempting Karma the ROE show last night kicked some facking arse...hooray....than i turned into a pumpkin and needed to get to bed at like one....i am old and boring... no plans for the weekend except for maybe watching some molly ringwald movies and making fun of them...ah valentines you asshole, alone again... actually it is not that bad...am liking being single, and R. and i  are good friends and can hang out with no awkwardness and that is very cool. Amazon.com has made me her bitch again and i am not pleased, i have three movies and two books coming that i ordered yesterday... even though i tried not too. oh well, i have no willpower cheers d

      Well so much to say, so little energy. School is continuing, so far am not disastrously behind. I am pleased about that. My house is a mess...i mean complete and total mess. My SAD is bad, but not as nasty as it was last year....i almost had a breakdown but than pulled it together. I haven't lost any weight...haven't gained any either. I am single. Least dramatic breakup ever. R. if you are reading this thanks for a fab couple of months. I had a lot of fun...but yes, we work better as friends. went to the MIA yesterday....i love art, and i had so much fun with k. giggling over the homo's who were strolling through....we didn't know weather to look at the art on the walls or that walkeing through the galleries. well kids nothing much else is new am broke got a raise that's it

      seriously, i don't want to wear my coat anymore. Really, i don't. And i am sick of the bus strike, really, i am. just kidding. I am so chill right now, happy with the world, calm. I am suprised. had so weird intense stuff happen this weekend, totally lost my balance for a while(for the full story give me a call, and if i know you well enough i will dish) than collapsed with something flulike, but now i am doing better, and i feel good. Oh, and i have lost 8 lbs since last tuesday...what is that? Must have been total bloatron. Anyways. so far in the weightloss competition with the rents i am seven pounds ahead. Oh yeah. Give me some competition and i will do anything to win!!! e-mail me talk to me love me, i am in a good mood. cheers d

      walked to work today in a short sleeve shirt and was warm...it is fabulous...hooray. yesterday walked home with my sleeves rolled up but that does'nt count. As soon as i get home today i am putting on the home-made, uptown, cut-off man capri's, ah yeah...those three inches of shin totally make the difference. I am so loving this weather...but, i want the trees to leaf out and the grass to green up.l I can't deal with all the brightness without anything to cut it. Sunglasses are really not my style. Think all the hair is coming off...shaving my head and getting rid of the beard. It is time for a change, and i realized wednesday night that i am starting to look old with the hair and the beard. Not like old old, but strange old. Time to get rid of that.

      yesterday, on my way home, i got to see a little duck action. By the bridge in Loring park the drakes are starting to jocky for the female ducks' attentions. This mostly consisted of a lot of quacking and waddling back and forth...three or four drakes in a little circle around one duck. The drakes would occasionally charge eachother with a great show of puffing out feathers and quacking and a little waddle dance which probably looks mean and tough to them, but to me looked like people trying to "boogie" at a wisconsin wedding. the duck sat contentedly preenin, occasionaly quaacking out encouragement as if to say" come and get it fellas, you know you want it." On the other side of the bridge and apparent duck couple walked back and forth on the shore looking at the courting drakes and seeming to laugh. Isn't love grand.  night class tonight, of course, on the day it gets to like 63 i have to walk not through the park, but down washington, across a highway and through a concrete university. I love my life.

      been on hiatus a bit recently i know, things have been marinating in the back of my mind. I think this is a side-effect of the bus strike. All of the walking i have been doing, which is generally solitary, has given me a lot of time for reflection, musing and meditation. It reminds me of the days i used to run a lot. When i was running i would forget everything but my breath and the fall of my foot, afterwards my mind would seem clearer and i would feel as though i hade tidied around my brain a little bit. I think that is what is happening to me now. I am sure the sunshine, fresh air, and excercise are contributing something too:especially after a winter in MN. I can truly believe that spring is here because i hear the birds now when i am walking(even on the most car adapted stretch of washington). I never hear them in winter, but once a certain amount of daylight is present each day they break out in song and i missed it during the winter.  I am longing to garden, just like i do each spring, and i really am going to have to see what mum and jannie are planning to do with the garden. I will lobby for chard and carrots again. They did so well last year and we eat as much as can be grown. Lettuce maybe? Beans, peas, tomatos. Oh well I am probably getting a little ahead of myself. Someday, though, i will have a garden of my own.

      Okay...managed a week at school without the bus, though it was rather unpleasant, at least i have been getting my evercise in, not that it has had any affect. Spring break is here, i had been planning on getting my 15 page paper done, however i have done nothing towards it, and shall have to really buckle down now i suppose, don't want to be stuck sunday night...Still walking, still no negotiation with the whole bus thing, strange....wish they would negotiate, am getting a little sick of walking. I enjoy the time outdoors, and i am sure that it has done wonders for my mood, but it has not been the best for my social life, i am sure. I cannot get around.Oh well. nothing really new in my world love and skittles d

      well, my darlings i have done nothing the past yesterday except for walk the dog, read, and watch some television....there is no cleaning, i haven't done any homework, i am not going out with my friends(much as i want to) and so i am not worrying about money, how much i drink, how much i smoke, who is angry with whom, or any number of other things which pinchat the back of my head....I must say i have not been bored yet, though there is still one day left. i believe that the change of location and total rest cure have been fairly beneficial....i am not as tweaky as i am wont to be...perhaps this is something i should do regularly so i don't suffer from nervous prostration....otherwise know in my world as total manic freaky anxious devin who than says fuck it to everything.... perhaps. anyways, glad i got the chance before the week of walking a lot through unknown routes....though fitness rewards, i must alwasy remember fitness awards. one more day, than back to the real world

      Not much doing today...walked my mom's dog...poor thing i don't think he gets walked much anymore...read several books(from the teens or so...about a society girl growing up) Very nice. obsessed about dieting and weight...found out that i am 20 pounds heavier on the scale here than at my house, which means that i am now 10 pounds heavier than i have ever been, tho i am a little comforted by the fact that i am not in quite so big pants...at least not yet. Plotted out a diet plan....hope it works, hope i can stick to it. Big part of it is not guzzling so much beer....realized that i really should not be gaining except for the beer...maybe i should stick to wine and spirits...or budget the beer calories...I'll have to think about it someone end the bus strike darlings, do please. devin

Spring is here and i am getting the gardening bug so hardcore. Too bad i have no garden of my own, but i do have some input on the moms' garden, so that is nice. Have to control my spending....and my house....need to get back to my routines and budget. Why is it so difficult for me to stick to any plan? cheers d

Too bad i have my night class tonight. The semester is almost over, Holy crap. When did that happen? Am getting really tired of bad elevator etiquette. I mean, why crowd the door to get on, some people have to get out of the elevator and you standing there not budging does not help. Facking Arsepicks. Mayday on sunday. Am not as excited as i should be. Perhaps the effect of all my homework that i have left to do. /cheers d

It was totally fab, and i got a new Hoodie out of the deal, thanks Brian, whoever you are:) It's sunny today and i am very pleased about that. Hopefully it will help lift me out of the doldrums i've been in recently. was a little surprised by how much i could drink last night without getting totally butt ass drunk, but i guess i have been building up a tolerance recently. Nothing really new going on.

      Grr. I really wish i had been chosen to be on it, and not just because very hot Jonathon Allen is a friend of Dorothy.(Though that would have been a perk.) I do wonder what would have happened if i had been, and then been patronized by former governer Wyse, the so. Baptist preacher. I shudder to think. So Spent last night sewing patchwork and watching colonial house. Obviously my rock star lifestyle is slipping a little. It must be the rain. It seems to pull me down somehow. Especially now that it is on it's fourth solid day. This afternoon after work the moms and the two D's are helping me move my old couches to the alley for pick up on city clean up day on thurs. And have not heard from Josh or Damien, and i really want to hang out with Josh, and i really want a chance to say goodbye to Damien before he moves away which is sometime this week.

      well, the weekend was a little too much car, a little too much moms. Saturday they picked me up at 8:30ish, and we got to the land at about 12:45. Stayed there until 6ish, and it was nice and not raining and even a few sunny minutes, the trillium were in bloom, and i caught the tail end of the swamp buttercups(not sure what they really are called, but jannie and i call 'em swamp buttercups)The birds were singing very loud, and we did some clean up from the logging that went on last winter for jannies road out to the knoll. I think i sprained or pulled my shoulder or something. Very painfull. Yesterday. Came home by 12:30 and spent the day in, listening to the rain. Went grocery shopping. Started sewing patchwork again. Nothing really new

      Okay SO. When i get handed a great big bowl of shit do I sit down and wallow in it? No, everyone knows that i go out and revel in Gin. Case in point, last night.  So.Did not go to work yesterday because i was ill...then ended up ending things with D., so now am single again. Still in shock from that. There had been some radical changes in the past two weeks that seemed to me to indicate a more secure and intense relationship. Apparantly just the opposite. So went to Lyles with J-dawg and A. and drank...it was two-for-ones-too. But in good news got my grades back, GPA is now officially up enough that i can go to grad school. Hooray. But in bad news, Homosexual men can no longer donate sperm in the U.S. supposedly because of H.I.V. which is ridiculous as there are now reliable and fast test, and HIV is not limited to the queer community. Sheer predjudice. They don't want us breeding. Period. Grrrr. Not that i want to breed. You all know how i feel about children, and especially the subject of me as parent. Will be gone this weekend in the wilds of Wisconsin with my mums. anyways off to brood on dumb stupid men and sigh as i read magnetic fiels 69 love songs lyrics over and over.

      How did this happen? Everything goes really well for a while, I am really happy, and then My life Morphs into a Telenovela...Fuck. Things with D. are strange...too much to figure out, and we must have the weirdest relationship on the planet, and i am allreading anticipating the summer and how much i am going to miss him and it blows. And i was so happy last week, and he was treating me like someone he was dating and things seemed so bright, and it was so sweet. He is the most romantic person i have dated(seriously, not saying much, but it is a really nice surprise) Am hopefully going to hang out with J.C. this week, and that would be really nice, but i think i might have frightened him off with my hungry like the wolf drunken phone calls two weeks ago, but come on, it's been like forever and i know he is attracted to me too, and just come on, it's spring time and it sucks being celibate when it is not your decision. Colonial house debuted last night, and i really missed Phil. I remember laying in bed one saturday morning talking about how i bet the nest reality pbs show will be colonial times, and he said let's apply as the alternative family. Then he left, and i applied on my own in some sort of weird rite od expiation of him. Seeing the conditions, probably the best i did not get in. I am not the best with super religiously dogmatic people One more thing. Shout out to the  urlLink Demimonde  ...the really cool message board about Kim Stanely Robinson, politics, society, science, progressive stuff, and just plain coolness.

This weekend: Saturday night Running On Empty played a show at the Acadia which kicked some ass, and then went to the Flaming Film Festival at Intermedia Arts With R. H. and M. Them fils were pretty cool, especially Tranny Fags...very hot Tranny porn. Super cool. Yesterday just chilled at home...very relaxing, if somewhat boring.

      Hey kids started finals this am at 8:00....what sick and twisted person scheduled that, and then had to go home, because in my growly morning blurriness forgot the paper i have to turn in tonight. Then back to campus where i sat in the coffee shop and did not study for several hours before finally studying for a few. Now i have my next final at 6:30 and then my last one on friday Hard to believe the semester is over, got all nostalgic last night with D. when we were studying. Am in a really great mood, keep smiling for no reason.

      friday is my last final i am having a party at eightish that night...be there or be square lots of stuff boiling through my head right now, probably won't blog 'em right yet. Good things though, but big scary adult things...and we all know how thinking makes my head hurt.  finally broke down, am going to do the three questions meme everyone has been doing. Got it from Gatsby's ghost, link on my side bar.  I want anyone who reads this to ask me 3 questions, no more no less. Ask me anything you want and I will truthfully answer. Then, I want you to go to your blog, copy and paste this allowing your friends to ask you anything.  will answer all questions...will post the most interesting

      had a kick ass time this weekend....involving the saloon, the cc, and brunch at m's....had to miss the mayday parade:( because of schoolwork, and still am swamped with schoolwork. A. dropped of the bike J. fixed for me last night. It is super fun happy. Red, a Raleigh....runs nicely....what more could i want? thanks a million J.:) Found out the boy i asked out probably didn;t think i actually asked him out and anyways was seeing someone.....don't i have puss on my face! awkwardness.... found out another boy i like probably likes me too( there were independent confirmations by two seperate friends on two seperate occasions this weekend that there was some serious chemistry going on) But the consensus is that i will have to be aggresive as he is shy. so....nothing will ever happen as i am too shy. though in my current mood i am not so sure. I really seem ready to grab life by the balls. It's the only way to get the good stuff.

      the warm weather finally came back. cast on and started the mate to the white sock i finished last week. When i was down at my fathers for the weekend i cleaned out the guest room closet and found a stash of 100% wool tiny tiny yarn from my grandmother, i think that went into a baby blanket or layette that i wore in the hospital 23 years ago. Well. There were tons of skeins left, and it was in good condition so i brought it home.  When i finished my homespun socks i cast on a sock in this yarn, on tiny needles. It works up very nicely and works with tante fanny's sock pattern, so i can knit at the tv or on the bus or in class, as i have that pattern engraved on my nervous system. So, it took one skein to knit up one sock and i must have twenty or so left, so i think everyone will get the socks they were asking for for christmass.  I am thinking that i will try dyeing some of it because creamy white wool for like 10 pairs of socks would drive me mad. I think i might also try knitting up a scarf in a lace pattern. I have to write a paper tonight, haven't finished the book yet, but it's due tomorrow, so i have to work it like i have to make rent, i guess. Nothing wild and exciting, school, knitting, weight loss. That's about it. Please, someone tell me that people are still doing wildly exciting things out there. Please.

      Color me dissapointed. Pride sucked. All it seemed to do was make me angry. Everything was corporate sponsor this, buy that, elect this. There seemed to be very little actually having to do with being gay or gaining rights, or honoring the history of the community. It was all corporate greed, political manouvering and cruising. Needless to say, i was not amused. Ah well. What can one do? Birthday coming up...grrr...time is flying by.  Party on the third at two o'clock at my place, Grilling out. Bring what you want to drink/grill. I might be going to a show that night, so party won't be an all day/all night thing:) PS. I am finally losing weight again

      So I have been avoiding dairy for a while because i am pretty lactose intolerant, and have stepped it up recently because i think i am getting allergic, I get all itchy and hivey after dairy these days. It has not been much of a problem,  never liked milk and yoghurt is good, but also not always my thing. But, cheese is so a different story. I love cheese, a lot. A Lot. But no more for me, i am tired of being ill all the time, and since i have been avoiding cheese as well as other dairy i feel much better.  Have stopped eating meat as well, just does not seem to agree with me. I do like it though, but again, tired of feeling ill.  So i guess i have turned vegan, though not for the reasons every other vegani know did. I still wear leather without feeling like a hypocrite. I don't have moral qualms about eating animal products. In fact, I probably still will from time to time, but healthwise for me it seems to be best to avoid them. More's the pity. Has not been too difficult though, albeit i haven't been eating out much, that might get tiresome, but most of my cooking was pretty Vegan as it was so that was not a drastic change. Not sure what to call myself now, I am sure I will slip and eat animal stuff every once in a while, and i won't feel guilty, so no really big moral reason to avoid it. But, that makes me not a Vegan? Part time Vegan? Predominantly Vegan? What?

      Have not really been posting much recently eh? Well. Life has calmed down a lot. I am knitting and doing my dishes before i go to bed and doing my chores on the days i decided they get done, and doing this  according to schedule  . Crazy And nothing really has been going on. Hung out with J.H. last night. Hit up the two for one's at Lyles and then watched a movie and talked until like three. It was great. But i got uber cranky at the end as i was allready sleep deprived, and then was even more tired. Sorry J-dawg! Down to Dad's this weekend for father's day. no other news

      Today is Mum and Jan's fourteen? year anniversary. COngratulations. Went to their house for a bbq with the aunties in honor of it on saturday. That was great fun. yesterday was spent in a meth addict style scrub o my kitchen and domestic happiness. I cooked a goose. Really.  A friend of Mum hunts and gave Mum and Jan a couple o wild geese, which they didn't want so i had them in my freezer and so yesterday i roasted it in the oven, in my Romertopf stuffed with chopped apples and onions and on a bed of the same, and doused with a little bit of vermouth (Noilly Prat of course)  It was super tasty, and leftovers are for tonight. The geese are very small, cooked they look like a slightly above avarage cornish game hen. In general i am avoiding meat, but i justified this as it was avoiding wast, it was wild and therefore somehow better then domesticated, and besides, i just like game. Today was the first day o summer class, should be an interesting six weeks. Let's hope i make it through. I think i will.

      Well, I got to meet Arlene, she seems nice, and Dad is very happy, probably the happiest I have ever seen him. But is was a bit strange. My family is pretty WASPy, with the wasp type of reserved manners and interactions. Arelene and co. are definately not, and so it was a very new experience to seem my wasp academe dad interacting with the world so freely and easilly. I don't know. It was a little too casual, a little to boundryless. I guess i must have been indoctrinated is WASP because it seems a little too forward and presumptous to me. Sat afternoon went to mum and jan's for a grill out with the aunties and keith. That was a lot of fun. Yesterday chilled with River catching up and then to Karaoke at Grumpy's with Sadietron. It was a good time. Today,the heat is a bit annoying, well not the heat, but the humidity. But, then again, i can never be satisfied with anything, can i?

      I think I am seeing the end of my stash of knitting things. Yesterday i ended up playing bloggin the yellow brick road of knitting blogs and realized how much i missed knitting. I had finished my mitts for smoking in the winter a few weeks ago and had not other projects to work on, other then patchwork and that is kinda boring. So i looked around to see what yarn i have. I am officially out of commercially bought yarn, and i have several balls and skeins of somewhat similair gauge homespun of various colors. All wool though. Decided that i am going to make another project for me. Out of all the pairs of homespun socks i have made i have never made a pair for me, and so that is what i did last night. Started a pair of socks. The uppers are stipes of madder dyed red and navaho tea yellow, sounds garish, but they work together. Heels will be natural grey, feet, stripes of white and black wool. Hopefully that will use up a bunch of the little odds and ends that i have left, and then i can make a scarf or hat or something for someone for christmass. I kow Droid wants a scarf. Like J-Dawgs. Will have to see. have to get some more wool. I have been iching to spin again and haven't sine i spun the last of my fleece last november. Oh Well. Meeting My dad's girlfriend tonight, can't confess that i am looking forward to it, but i am sure it will be fine. What could go wrong?

      Wow. What a change a little sunshine can make in my mood. Almost two days of sun so far, after rain for like 20 of the past 22 days or so(note to self, abandon all hope of moving to pacific northwest. Rain and cloud makes you sad) Hooray for Sun and warmer temps!!! Nothing wild and exciting going on, am trying to cut back/quit smoking and cut back on the coffee and booze, and so far am succeding. Am having only 2 cups o coffee a day, and only five smokes, and have not drank since A.V.'s birthday last sunday, which granted is only a few days, but am not doing the whole"I'm home from work, let's call anyone i can reach and drag them to the C.C. club" thing. In addition. My house is a little less out of control. I have actually been doing stuff like cleaning and picking up after myself. Crazy. My current obsession is money/cash/bling. I am really trying to stick to a budget and stop using the credit card so often, but i am so sick of being poor. Anyone want to donate to the Devin is poor but deserves nice things fund? In other news, get to meet my Dad's new girlfriend this weekend when i go down to see him. I am a little weirded out by that, but i suppose it will go okay.; But it is unfair: he is 80 and has had two wives, and he is dating someone. I am 22 and have not had a relationship go longer than five months and i am single. The world really is most horribly unfair. anyways back to work d

      Hello all long weekend, lot's o rain. saturday didn't do much, just chilled. friday night went to J-dawg's and had a bonfire, super nice, and what could be better than some champagne:) Sunday it was A.V.'s 21st. Have not seen her and J.J. in years. It was a total trip. Yesterday, went to Aunt Elke's house and planted with mum 15 Lilacs, 3 box, 2 barberry, 1 variegated dogwood and some bee balm, siberian irs, and cornflowers for her garden. I am sore today, the arthritis is so not liking the damp weather. Picked some greens yesterday at the garden as well. Just had a salad of them. Home grown, organic lettuce, mizuna, and arugula. I love gardening:)

      Shite, not shit, but shite, and these are two different feelings in my book. Also different are feeling like ass and feeling like arse....again, two seperate things. Due to the illness the rockstar drinking has been curtailed, and i am reduced to watching PBS, knitting(anyone want a homespun handknit wool hat in gray and white....very nice, very soft, maybe i'll keep it) reading and going to sleep at 10:00 which is very odd for me. I am also regretting last sunday's drunken e-mail to damien, which is much worse than drunk dialing as now there is a record, and the only reason i e-mailed was that i was all drunk and maudlin and lonely. While i do miss him at times there is no way in hell (which i am happy to say the  urlLink Hitch  will be joining me in at some future date) I would want anything to re-start between us.  Grrrr I will reiterate. Boys are dumb.

      so today was the last day o class and i never got the contact info for hot jeremmy, but you can be sure that i will be showing up sometime when he is bartending(evil laugh....oh yeah) Hopefully i can get some writing done in the month before fall semester starts, that would be really nice, have not written in like a month or more, and my soul is so dying. That must end. got the last two seasons of Babylon five tonight, pounding thelast nails into my coffin of geekdom, but i love it, but fuck it, love me, love my geekdom. no other news except for the fact that i still have not spoken to my Dad about his engagement still, God that still freaks me out. nothing else new.

      Jesus The fun i had last night. Floated down the minnehaha with J. ans A. and Droid and a friend of his, and it was great. The weather was so hot snd sticky yesterday, oppresivly so, and the water was heavenly(so was the flasking) and i am definately doing that again despite all the pollution etc. After all, what is a little fecal coliform when yer having fun? J. dropped off a new bike fer me yesterday, the Raleigh was way to tall, so that goes to a different one of her friends, and i got this kick ass brown schwinn. It is a girls bike, but who cares, an it is the perfect size fer me and i am so excited about, i know i will be taking a long ride on it tonight. Total and completed surprise it was too. Called her up to see if i could hit up her haircut guy fer a trim and she is all, what are you up to tonight, let me finish working on yer new bike and i'll bring it over. I was totally gobsmacked. Last day o class tomorrow, praise be.

      Back home, back to work, back in the middle of things again. It is blessed blessed non-suburban living. How i missed thee!! Last day of summer class is on Friday, How Happy I am. Though the two papers that need to be written between now and then are a little less happy, but i will get through it like a pro. Hung out with a guy I knew in German class three or four years ago last night. I had a good time. Ended up watching Lost in translation, which i liked, and playing X box, which i also liked, surprisingly.  Started spinning some of the wool i got at Creative fibers last week. i washed some this weekend, and spun some up on sunday, navaho plied some of it this morning whilst watching(shamed look, and in a whispered voice) Dawson's Creek. I really like how it is turning out. It is a white Romney i think, and it has a great hand, very soft, and the navaho ply makes a nice even round yarn that catched the light marvelously. Perfect for some cable/gansey/aran type knitting. I have only a pound of it, but it still seems a daunting task to spin it all on a spindle. I need to get a wheel.

      Shit. Friday and nothing to do. Pretty much representative i guess. If i were at home i would at least crack a few beers, but no beer here.  Tomorrow i think i might go to the seventh street entry and see a show. I have not been to one in such a long time. maybe j with go along, and i might call anne and see if she will be there too.  I think tomorrow night i will be getting blotto, completely blotto. Go to a show, go to the TR or the CC, hopefully the CC and i will have so much fun.  That'd be nice.  one more week of summer school. That will be very nice to have over, however i have a re-write and another essay to do.  Am excited to see some  urlLink people  actually are reading my blog. Go check his out. He has just the right combination of irony, bitterness, and apathy.

      Okay So Right now i am supposed to be in class, but somehow over slept so much that I only just woke up.  Oh well Yesterday i had a great time with J.h. We went to Creative Fibers, and i bought a lot of wool to spin, and started dealing for a new spinning wheel, as i seem to have very bad luck with both the wheels i had, and which ended up either warping or the wood splitting or something. Afterwards we went to Diggers and spent an hour and a half or maybe two there. I got a messenger bag, a leather bag(very nice one), a man purse, two belts, threee ties, a sweater and a shirt. two hats and some other stuff i do not remember, and all of that for $4.25. God i love that place. Nothing really going on right now other then that. Day before yhesterday just hung out at the Triple Rock for a while, it was so relaxing to get out of the suburbs. I will be so glad to get home and back to the city, well, only a few days more of housesitting.

      Wow re- reading my last few posts i seem to have been launched into the reanks of the estrogen endowed. Not that there is anything wrong with women, being womenly, or anything estrogen related.(I could never feel that, being raised among Amazons as i was) But i seem to be particularly female recently, and that is rather odd. I really want to watch a soccer or rugby game, have a few beers, go camping, chop wood, oh i don't know anything to regain the last shreds of testosterone i have. But am not sure what to do. I am beginning to wilt, being stuck out here in the suburbs, and there are still five more days to go. Housesitting rots, especially when one has no car

      Well kids, here I am in Richfield, housesitting for the Mum's again. This time for a little over a week. I have the time off work, but still need to make it to school. It should be a nice time for me to relax, and to catch up on homework, and some crafty things. Got my loom fixed yesterday, after letting it molder for several(4?) years in the basement without touching it. I suppose that I have become a little more patien in that time, because all it really took was some logic to figure out what was wrong, and some patience to actually fix it. Am hoping to get home soon to take care of some things i forgot, and to pick up my sleying hook and water my plants and see what has been delivered from my orders to Amazaon, so i shoulkd have lots of things to keep me occupied.Am going to try and make it to creative fibers so i can get some big knitting projects going. a sweater or something, and then sone nifty hats or scarves etc for christmass presents for people.  Spent time with my Aunt Elke yesterday, I love her a lot, but she always reminds me of how much one controls one's own happiness. I always come away from visiting with her with a new deternmination not to make myself miserable, and in the mood i have been in recently that is a good thing. So. Hopefully life will improve for me soon as i learn to take better care of myself and work to keep myself out of depression.

      The weekend was pretty fun. Party on saturday seeed to go pretty well. Sunday went swimming at Carol and Penny's with the Mum's, that was really nice, got some excercise and some badly needed sun.They gave me my birthday presents and brought sushi.l Yum!! Yesterday rested for a while, watched a lot of B5, then did pilates, laundry, and some badly needed chores around the house. Only had two smokes yesterday, none today so far. Have been thinking that it is time that i cut back, on the drinking as well. Am getting way to close to depression to be drinking so much. Really have been feeling the need to get more active and brood a little less. Hopefully i can snap myself out of this funk before it gets too bad.

      I suppose they can be, but I am ass tired, and am not liking my class very much at all. Way too much marxist propaganda...litterally propaganda. I am going out to dinner tonight with the Mum's to Lucia's so that should be nice, and i might hang out with them on sunday. Saturday is my party, and i am in no way prepared. House is a mess, so it will be a late night tonight, i am sure. 23 in two days...funny. I don't even care. Birthdays really don't mean much to me. It will be nice to hang out with everyone, have a little party, etc. Happy holiday weekend(and by holiday i mean when the world was blessed with such a treasure as myself.)

      So, went over to N.'s house last night and watched Fight Club...which i thoroughly enjoyed. This surprised me, many of my friends had warned me off the film saying that it was too violent and that i would be uncomfortable watching it. While i must admit that there was a certain amount of flinching, and even one a gag, the violence did not particularly bother me. I thought the premise of the film, with it's fucked up little twists was awesome and really liked it. What became of the delicate flower who could not bear to see a punch thrown in a film, let alone blood spattering and bones crunching? Also played some videogames, which i also have to admit i have a secret fondness. so today i feel totally and completely boy, although that probably was marred a little bit when i worked on the baby-booties i am knitting, this morning.

      Yesterday went to my first fringe fesitval show and laughed my arse off, which was painfull, having done pilates only an hour earlier. "*results not typical" was genius, funny, and very relevent in this day of fad diets etc. I heartilly recomend it. Brunched today with my friend A. who I have known since sixth grade, probably one of my oldest if not the oldest friend i have, and we always brunch at Keys every time she is back in the state. Good chat, just catching up. I am really enjoying the weather....fifties and overcast. Perfect.  Nothing else new,exciting or crazy. Pretty calm in my life today Finished J.H.'s socks yesterday and gave 'em to her, she really liked them and it is nice to finish a project and have something to show fer my fibre obsession.

      So i went to my papa's friday night and back on saturday and spent quite some time with his fiance and her family. I very much and beginning to dislike them, they are vulgar and seem to be rather mean spirited, and i have no idea what to do. Papa seems happy, though i suspect a lot of that is simply the fact that he does not feel alone. I am glad that he is happy, but i feel like such a hippocrite reassuring him that I like her and her family when he asks(repeatedly). I feel like I can't really tell him my opinion about this woman because he is so happy and i have no desire to create conflict, my family has had so much of that as it is. I suppose i will keep quiet, he keeps saying that they will never get married or live together, but i doubt that very much, she allready seems very proprietary of his house and all his things, and that worries me.  But, nothing really I can do I suppose. yesterday did not do much, baked some bread and did some pilates and hung out with the Slavic princess and her boyfriend, who really does look like he should be summering with the kennedys at kennybunkport.(sp?) anyways. My life is not exciting. I am trying not to be green with envy at the fact that my friend K. is dating someone. Trying, not succeding so well, but trying, and at least am not showing that I am.

      Last night was classic! J. came over to work out, but we ended up being very surly and going to Lyles for a few two-for-one's. Them A. swung by and we went to the smitten kitten(I love my new toy) Then to the CC club, which has changed a lot in the month or so since i was there last, the entire crowd is now metal heads and suburban prats. Strange. But someone left some glasses there, and hello new frames to me. Highlight of the evening must have been the trip to Kowalski's and subsequent picnic outside of it at midnight thirty. SO much fun. Back home afterwards to watch some of "Party Monster" and the they went home and i went to bed. This morning, nary a whiff of a hangover, how do i do it?

      So i got an e-mail back from the straight ex today, in response to a sappy one i sent whilst drunk a few weeks ago. Why do i do that? It is much better to daydream about them daydreaming about you then to be struck in the face with the cold reality. His e-mail was short, chatty, upbeat, and utterly soulless. The type one would send to a highschool friend who contacts you out of the blue. Doesn't make me sad, but...hmmm...doesn't make me really angry either, it feels like a total cop-out, especially since this was one of the many without closure. I sure do know how to pick 'em. I repeat my mantra....Boys are Dumb( I am incuding me in that) Speaking of. J.C. was supposed to take me out last weekend, but mixed up a work thing and couldn't but was all chatty and complimenting me and flirtatious and saying how he had to make it up sometime this week, and now has fallen off the face of the planet. Again!! Did not go out last night, just sat on my porch, chain smoking, reading, and glaring at the block-party. Because of the rain on tuesday they had it last ngiht and the whole street was full of community, children, puppies, good intentions, and involvement. Needless to say it put me in a foul mood, but didn't want to pub or coffee shop it either...tried to frind a friend to rescue me but everyone was gone. it is times like that when i feel that the rapture has happened and i am in hell. skittles

      Okay watching the BBC news last night and one of the headlines are "Opec head says that 'oil prices are crazy'" and for some reason this struck me as hilarious and I giggled for a good few minutes, after which i decided this had to be blogged. Am feeling a little more human and a little less like Gollum after pilates and chatting with J.H. last night. Somehow everything looks a little less bleak.  Am thinking of going out tonight, just me, and see if i can't strike up conversation with anyone. I am a sort of social parapalegic, and really need to practice my skills of interaction if i don't want to be a wallflower(any longer) The humidity has abated somewhat, which is a godsend, and hopefully will remain out of the stratosphere. Looks like I will get a bunch of food from the garden when i see Mum and Jan this weekend, Beans, Peas, Eggplants, Hot peppers, Lemon cucumbers, herbs, collards, lettuce, swiss chard. That will certainly help out the I Hate Being Poor fund, produce is so expensive, especially organic produce. d

      why won't the rain drop the humidity allready....i am really getting tired of being barely able to breathe due to a combination of allergies, asthma and humidity....and really people are going to start growing mold soon if it stays this damp much longer. Have to go to my Dad's house this weekend, i really don't want to, could really care less, but it is expected, and Mom would freak if i did not. last night did absolutely nothing productive, binged on a combination of suchi, chesecurds, and luce's delivery and then vegetated in front of the television. Baah..i know that i am in a little funk here, but do i really have to be so stereotypical? pilates tonight with j-dawg.

        You speak eloquently and have seemingly read every book ever published. You are a fountain of endless (sometimes useless) knowledge, and never fail to impress at a party. What people love: You can answer almost any question people ask, and have thus been nicknamed Jeeves. What people hate: You constantly correct their grammar and insult their paperbacks.    urlLink   What Kind of Elitist Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       if that was not accurate enought, try this, though this is a bit depressing  I am a  Cancer .  (Also known as "Crab")  My  urlLink  Horroscope   starts like this:  "  A failure by definition, a Cancer is both a conservative and an opportunist, stuck in a constant state of  self-reflection. Nothing and no one is capable of changing his mind, but he loves to argue, just to make fun of his opponent and look better in his own bulging eyes.

      This would be the weekend of perspective...when i realized that i have none. I seem to always be at one extreme or the other, and wow does that make for one hell of a ride. Friday, stayed home, watched movies, to bed early. Saturday....up early, puttered around the house, haircut(which looks fab, also the beard is gone,replaced by a tiny(J, i did make it smaller), tragically hip goatee and soul patch. Went with J. and A. and basically ended up spending the day with them. The T-rock, then just hanging out on my porch, drinking heavilly and chatting  about music and life etc, which was great, but the drinking was a little much. Then to Lyles to meek K. and the Slavic Princess and other grad students on the fringe of the U. but then run home, lots of horking, unpleasant, and to bed, where i procede to sleep for two hours, and then wake up unable to sleep any more, I am supposed to be at the Moms' by 10:30, finally get back to sleep at around nine, wake up two more hours later. Desperately try and reach a hold of someone, flirt with J.C. on the phone( I have no clue, but he is seriouslly mr. mixed signals) coffee with the Slavic Princess, realize i am not happy with the prospect of teaching history, being caught up in academic squabbling and red tape and politics or any other aspect of life in academia. try not to freak out as now have no future to look forward to. home and watch the hallmark channel while knitting and eating an entire camembert...mmmmm. sleep by 11:00, up this am at 8:30. This has been a reeactment in two days of my past month or so....first i sit at home and hide, chaste, pure, and silent as a monk full of plans for self-discipline, personal growth etc. The weight falls off, along with my sanity and soon i am climbing the walls in disgust at my own inner pollyanna. Then i end up going out every night, spending the grocery money in bars, smoking my self hoarse, being bitter and sarcastic and unnecesarily cruel to those who don't deserve it and end up sick and apalled at how caustic i can be. No middle ground. nothing. One extreme or the other.  What can i do to colm this down? Anyone?
