      So today was pretty awesome.....  Starting last night, first, I went to Maceys house at like 8 :30.  Then me Macey and Tiffany watched their AAU game on tape.  Then we called people at like 10:30 to come over today.  Then we gave eachother pedicure and manicures and put on face masks! It was so much fun!  I really miss hanging out with them 2 girls....they're my favorite!  Then at like 2 we went to bed.  We woke up this morning at like 9.  Then we did eachothers hair and makeup before people came at like 12.  We also shaved together in the bathtub (real weird yet fun!).  Then people came over and we went in the pool and played basketball and truth or dare and went on the trampoline and played hide and go seek and had a lot of fun!!!  Then we went and got pizza then hung out some more and then we went home.  Now I am here and bored as hell....yeah......  thats about it for now   post it

      Okay the last few days have been really fun...  Friday me tiffany macey and justin went to the carnival together. Alex was supposed to go but we never got ahold of him.  So there we met up with Nick and Tom and everyone went on rides together. We saw a lot of people we knew there too.....So we ran out of tickets real fast so we headed to Macey's house for some fun!   Saturday I went to the carnival again with Katy Sam and Shannon! It was really fun we went on many many rides...I think I made some new friends from Ware too! I saw my cousin that I hadnt in a wicked long time but we ended up not talking to eachother cause we thought we hated eachother (which we dont). So that sucked that we didnt talk.  So when Katy Sam and Shannon left I hung out with Courtney and her friends Ashley and Ray I think their names were.  That was fun too!  Today is fathers day and we had a cookout with the family here at my house. Tonight Im sleeping over Maceys house and its gonna be a blast!!!! YaY!!!   You can post if you wanna!
