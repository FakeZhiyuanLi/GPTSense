      Galatians 2:15 We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners; 16 yet we know that a person is justified not by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ. And we have come to believe in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by doing the works of the law, because no one will be justified by the works of the law. 17 But if, in our effort to be justified in Christ, we ourselves have been found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!  18 But if I build up again the very things that I once tore down, then I demonstrate that I am a transgressor. 19 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God. I have been crucified with Christ; 20 and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. 21 I do not nullify the grace of God; for if justification comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing.

      Luke 7:36 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and took his place at the table. 37 And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. 38 She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment. 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him-- that she is a sinner."  40 Jesus spoke up and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." "Teacher," he replied, "Speak." 41 "A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42 When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?" 43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt." And Jesus said to him, "You have judged rightly." 44 Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. 45 You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.  47 Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little." 48 Then he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." 49 But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" 50 And he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." Luke 8:1 Soon afterwards he went on through cities and villages, proclaiming and bringing the good news of the kingdom of God. The twelve were with him, 2 as well as some women who had been cured of evil spirits and infirmities: Mary, called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out, 3 and Joanna, the wife of Herod's steward Chuza, and Susanna, and many others, who provided for them out of their resources.

      I don't usually preach from the Psalms.  Not sure why, maybe I should more often?  Psalm 51:1   Have mercy on me, O God, according to your steadfast love; according to your abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.  2 Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.  3 For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.  4 Against you, you alone, have I sinned, and done what is evil in your sight, so that you are justified in your sentence and blameless when you pass judgment.  5 Indeed, I was born guilty, a sinner when my mother conceived me.  6 You desire truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.  7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.  8 Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones that you have crushed rejoice.

      Have you ever wondered what Ordinary time is?  Well, we don't call it that because it is boring or mundane and other times of the church year aren't.  We use the term "ordinary" because we use ordinal numbers (1st, 2nd, 3rd, vs. 1, 2, 3) to label the Sundays.  The OT lesson this week is 1 Kings 21:1-10 (11-14), 15-21a.  Fairly often the lectionary people get cutesy with the verses they choose and often skip around a bit.  I always like to look at the whole thing and then choose which verses to use.  1 Kings 21:1 Later the following events took place: Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria. 2 And Ahab said to Naboth, "Give me your vineyard, so that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house; I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money." 3 But Naboth said to Ahab, "The LORD forbid that I should give you my ancestral inheritance." 4 Ahab went home resentful and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him; for he had said, "I will not give you my ancestral inheritance." He lay down on his bed, turned away his face, and would not eat. 5 His wife Jezebel came to him and said, "Why are you so depressed that you will not eat?" 6 He said to her, "Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, 'Give me your vineyard for money; or else, if you prefer, I will give you another vineyard for it'; but he answered, 'I will not give you my vineyard.'" 7 His wife Jezebel said to him, "Do you now govern Israel? Get up, eat some food, and be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite."  8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name and sealed them with his seal; she sent the letters to the elders and the nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. 9 She wrote in the letters, "Proclaim a fast, and seat Naboth at the head of the assembly; 10 seat two scoundrels opposite him, and have them bring a charge against him, saying, 'You have cursed God and the king.' Then take him out, and stone him to death." 11 The men of his city, the elders and the nobles who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. Just as it was written in the letters that she had sent to them, 12 they proclaimed a fast and seated Naboth at the head of the assembly. 13 The two scoundrels came in and sat opposite him; and the scoundrels brought a charge against Naboth, in the presence of the people, saying, "Naboth cursed God and the king." So they took him outside the city, and stoned him to death.  14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned; he is dead." 15 As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, "Go, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead." 16 As soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab set out to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. 17 Then the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying: 18 Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria; he is now in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. 19 You shall say to him, "Thus says the LORD: Have you killed, and also taken possession?" You shall say to him, "Thus says the LORD: In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood." 20 Ahab said to Elijah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" He answered, "I have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD, 21 I will bring disaster on you; I will consume you, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel;

      Ministers in the  urlLink Presbyterian Church (USA)  are free to preach on any scripture they like on any given Sunday.  But I would guess that a majority of Presbyterian pastors preach from the Revised Common Lectionary.  What's that?  Good question.  A lectionary is simpling a collection of readings from the Bible that are put together for us in Christian worship.  They have been around for over 1500 years in various forms.  The Revised Common Lectionary was created in 1992 and is based on the Roman Lectionary for Mass of 1969.  It is a three year cycle of readings that usually includes an Old Testament reading, a Psalm, A Gospel reading, and an Epistle reading for each Sunday (and other holy days like Ash Wednesday, Good Friday, etc.).  The three years are labeled Year A, B, and C.  Each year focuses on one of the synpotic Gospels.  Year A is Matthew, year B is Mark, and Year C is Luke.  John is read each year, most often around Christmas, Lent, and Easter.  The basic thing to know is that every Sunday I am preaching, I usually choose one of the lectionary readings to preach from.  If you want to know more you can borrow the book on the RCL that I got most of this information from: "The Revised Common Lectionary" by a group called "The Consultation on Common Texts."

      Ok, so I got this idea.  Why don't I start a blog where I put down my thoughts, observations, and work-in-progress for upcoming sermons and then invite people to offer their comments, thoughts, interpretations, and suggestions?  Hopefully this accomplishes several purposes.  1) It encourages me to begin the process early enough to include others.  2) I get other perspectives on the Biblical texts and feedback on my ideas before preaching them.  3) I get to spend more time online!  And being the uber-geek wannbe that I am, that's a good thing.  So here is how I envision this working (that is if I ever publicize this and if anyone is interested in participating).  About a month ahead of time I'll post the lectionary texts for the Sunday I am preaching for people to peruse and think about.  A week later I'll post some of my preliminary thoughts on each text and which one I am thinking of going with.  About two weeks ahead of time I'll try to have a focus for my sermon and then continue posting about various thoughts on that focus.  I don't plan on posting drafts of my sermons, because those happen late in the process and I'd rather have people hear them first rather than read them.  But I will post them after preaching for discussion.  Hopefully, anyone reading this will feel free to post their own comments, whatever they may be.  Writing a sermon is a daunting task because it is hard to know what to say to a large and somewhat diverse group of people.  The more I talk with the people I am preaching to, the better my sermons should be!  One more thing to keep in mind as you read this.  Carrie almost always proofreads my sermons and helps me with grammar and clarity.  She won't be proofing my posts here, so go easy on me when my posts aren't as polished as they should be.  Here we go!

      Luke 7:36-50  Luke 7:36 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him, and he went into the Pharisee's house and took his place at the table. 37 And a woman in the city, who was a sinner, having learned that he was eating in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster jar of ointment. 38 She stood behind him at his feet, weeping, and began to bathe his feet with her tears and to dry them with her hair. Then she continued kissing his feet and anointing them with the ointment. 39 Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw it, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him-- that she is a sinner." 40 Jesus spoke up and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you." "Teacher," he replied, "Speak." 41 "A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. 42 When they could not pay, he canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?" 43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one for whom he canceled the greater debt." And Jesus said to him, "You have judged rightly." 44 Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has bathed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair. 45 You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not stopped kissing my feet. 46 You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. 47 Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which were many, have been forgiven; hence she has shown great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven, loves little." 48 Then he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven." 49 But those who were at the table with him began to say among themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?" 50 And he said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."  Autochthonous.  A-U-T-O-C-H-T-H-O-N-O-U-S.  Autochthonous.  That was the word that David Tidmarsh, an eight grader from South Bend, spelled correctly to win the 2004 National Spelling Bee on June 3rd.  Maybe some of you watched the spelling bee on TV this year, or saw a clip of David spelling the winning word on a news program.  When the second place finisher made a mistake on his word, David knew that he had a chance to win the whole thing by spelling the next two words correctly.  His breathing quickened, he started hiding his face behind his hands, and tears started welling up in his eyes. He had to spell two words correctly to win, but  it seemed that there was a very real possibility that he might pass out, hyperventilate, or just start sobbing right there on the stage before he got through those two words.  In the end 14 year old David made it through and won.  After he correctly spelled the final word, tears started coming from his eyes in earnest.    The writer Albert Smith once said that “tears are the safety valve of the heart when too much pressure is laid on it.”  I can’t imagine much more pressure than being 14 years old and having to spell ‘gaminerie’ and ‘autochthonous’ on national television.  I’m pretty sure I would cry too.  It sounds weird to say this about a spelling bee, but it was a very powerful and emotional moment.  I’m sure David was feeling an overwhelming mix of emotions.  He was probably nervous, scared, excited, tentatively joyful, unsure of all the attention he was getting and the pressure he was under.   Maybe he was going through the same range of emotions that the unnamed woman was.  This woman who came to see Jesus when he was eating with Simon the Pharisee.  What was she feeling?  Fear, excitement, anxiety, tentative joy, uncertainty at all the attention she was getting?  Tears were coming from her eyes too, and if tears really are the safety valve of the heart then it makes perfect sense for her to have plenty at that moment, because she would have been under a lot of pressure.   We don’t know who this woman is.  Her name is not given and the only description we have of her is that she is a “sinner.”  Many people have identified this woman as Mary Magdalene, although there is no reason in the passage to do so.  Many people have identified this woman as a prostitute, though once again, the passage says no such thing.  What is important to note, is that she was known as a “sinner.”  Now to you and I, that may not sound like a horrible thing to be called.  After all, aren’t we all sinners?  But to Jewish people at that time, to label someone a sinner was to define them as a certain type of person with whom proper religious people (especially great teachers and Pharisees) would not associate.  So Jesus and Simon the Pharisee are having dinner together.  Most likely they are reclining on the floor in an open air house or courtyard with quite a few people around them.  In this setting, the woman approaches Jesus and pours tears and oil on his feet and wipes them with her hair.  This probably would have been seen as scandalous by many people at that dinner.  It certainly was for Simon.  His first reaction is to be shocked that Jesus would be so ignorant of what was right and what was wrong.  Simon can’t believe that Jesus would allow this woman to touch him in when everyone knows that it wasn’t right to do so.  But Jesus looked down at this woman, with tears running down her face, and saw that she was hurting.  Where Simon saw a sinner, Jesus saw a woman in tears.  Tears are a funny thing.  A tear is something very small, but it can have a profound impact on people.  I’m sure that many of us have been in conversation with a friend, a family member, or maybe someone not even that close, and in the middle of that conversation, for whatever reason, a tear starts to form in the eye of the other person.  Maybe it was something you said that triggered a memory, maybe they’ve been having a really bad day and they just are at a breaking point, maybe there isn’t a real good reason but that person starts to cry anyway.  At that moment, when standing face to face with tears, your attention shifts, your emotions change.  You may feel an overwhelming urge to reach out and hug them, maybe you get uncomfortable, maybe you want to offer your help or tell them everything will be OK.  When someone is crying, when someone is in tears, we usually stop what we are doing and pay attention to that person.  Isn’t it that way with children?  Babies and children cry so much because it works!  Tears get our attention, tears bring about action.  Crying doesn’t always get a child the most expensive toy in the toy store, but it does usually get a comforting hug from Dad or Mom.  We usually cry at times of grief or loss; times when we are feeling low or vulnerable.  Tears often come to us when we are in pain and we have a hard time seeing beyond the moment.  But I think tears are a good thing.  Because tears are like a natural warning flag that says, “Hey, something is going on with me and I need some love!”    Tears have a way of changing us.  Have you ever been in an argument with someone you love?  An argument where you are sure that you are right.  You know with certainty that you’re position is the correct position and you are resolved not to budge.  But then the argument crosses a line and your loved one starts to tear up or cry.  I don’t know about you, but at that moment I find that right and wrong don’t matter so much.  When I look into the tear filled eyes of someone I love, those tears usually trump my argument.  Sometimes it is better to be wrong and caring, rather than right and hurtful.  We see this in Jesus.  No one would have thought twice if Jesus would have gotten up, walked away from the woman, and demanded that she go on her way.  I’m sure that the woman expected that Jesus might do so.  But he doesn’t.   Instead he sees her tears and he focuses all his attention, and the attention of everyone else, on this woman.  In doing so Jesus sends the message that the tears of this woman are more important then what is “right” and what is “wrong.”  That’s a message that we need to hear today.  As Christians called to follow Jesus’ example, we need to reach out to those people with tears in their eyes and care for them.  Sometimes we need to put aside our notions of what is right, wrong, proper, unacceptable, safe, or risky, and we need to go to those who are crying.    What if you woke up every morning and prayed this prayer, “Lord, who is crying today?  And how can I help them?”  I think that’s a good prayer to start each day with, but none of us should pray it unless we are ready to follow through.  I think that if we look around to see who is crying, we are going to see tears on a lot of faces, and those tears may call us to go to new places and to meet new people.  “Lord, who is crying today?  And how can I help them?”  There are millions of people in our country living in poverty.  Tears are shed because they don’t have enough money for rent.  Children are growing up malnourished and living in unsanitary conditions.  But surely, they can find a job or get help somewhere else.  It’s wrong to merely give them a hand-out they didn’t work for.  Is it right that we should give up more of our hard-earned money to help them?  Right.  Wrong.  How much does it matter when you are face to face with the tears from a single mother who has to choose between paying the heating bill and paying for her child’s medicine?  “Lord, who is crying today?  And how can I help them?”  There are nursing homes all across our country where elderly people who have no financial resources and no family to take care of them are put.  I’m not talking about some of the excellent privately owned and well-funded care facilities we have in Rochester Hills.  In these homes crying and tears are common sights and sounds because these people are lonely and have few, if any, visitors.  But we aren’t doing anything wrong if we forget about them.  They aren’t our family.  We are doing the right thing for our parents.  Right.  Wrong.  How much does it matter to the lonely, old man who cries every night because he doesn’t understand why no one cares enough to visit him?  “Lord, who is crying today?  And how can I help them?”   How many tears are shed every day in our country by those people who are gay?  How can someone not cry when they are told that who they are is wrong, deviant, and unnatural?  Fresh tears must come when you are at the funeral of a gay relative and there are protesters there with signs telling you that the deceased is now in hell.  But doesn’t the Bible say homosexuality is wrong?  And even if we’re not sure what the Bible says, maybe we just aren’t comfortable with people who are gay?  Right.  Wrong.  How much does it matter when a young gay boy takes his own life in anger and sadness because his parents don’t love who he is?      “Lord, who is crying today?  And how can I help them?”  It’s not that what is right and what is wrong doesn’t matter, but we can’t use our ideas of right and wrong to ignore the hurt and pain that people are going through.    “Lord, who is crying today?  And how can I help them?”  If we pray that prayer we are going to see tears on the faces of many people.  Gay, straight, black, white, Asian-American, Native American, immigrants (illegal and legal), young, old, rich, poor.  Wherever we go, we will be faced with someone’s tears, and at that point we have two choices.  We can choose to do what Simon the Pharisee did.  We can be overly-concerned with what is “right” and what is “wrong.”  We can worry about being proper and not compromising our status or position.  We can sleep well at night knowing we did “the right thing.”  Or we can choose to do what Jesus did and act first and foremost with love.  Love that doesn’t ignore anyone, but reaches out to people and loves the good in them and forgives the bad.  We can choose to comfort them, help to give them hope, and wish them peace.  It’s not easy.  And I know that we are going to have our share of tears along the way.  But if we all choose the way of Jesus, then wherever we go, whenever the tears come, we will be there to reach out to other and there will be someone there to reach out to us, give us a hug and let us know that we too are loved.  In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One God, Mother of us all.  Amen.

      I think I'm going to focus on tears.  The woman in Luke's story barges into this dinner and washes Jesus' feet with her tears.  I read in one commentary that it was a custom to save your tears in a stone jar, and that in order for her to have enough tears to wash Jesus' feet she would have had to collected a lot of tears over a long time.  Usually tears are caused by pain, loss, grief, etc.  I know there are tears of joy as well, but unfortunately they're not as common.  Here are some of the thoughts I am asking thinking as a I begin to write the sermon:  What does it mean to collect our tears (figuratively, not literally)?  What would it mean to bring them to Jesus' feet?  When someone is crying it gets our attention, we listen to them more closely, seek to help them more.  Jesus attends to the needs of the woman in the story much to the dismay of his host.  His attention goes to the one who has been crying.  Does our attention/efforts go to the ones who have been crying?  When what we do causes someone pain/grief/loss then we need to make sure we are doing God's will.    I've been thinking about one area in particular.  It won't be the focus of my sermon but it will be in it.  Gay marriage is a hot topic right now.  There are passionate intelligent people on all sides of the issue.  There are people who are angry on all sides of the issue.  But I have heard a lot of sadness from people who are gay but feel that our country says they are broken/deviant/wrong to love the person they love.  I don't hear a lot of sadness from people against gay marriage.  I am sure that countless tears have been shed by people who are gay and their loved ones.  But how many tears have been shed on the other side of the issue?  These kind of questions don't answer who is right or who is wrong (or at least not completely), but they should caution all of us.  When our actions (or inactions) cause tears, we better be really, really sure that we are doing the right thing.

      For this week's and next week's sermons I am going to be talking about prophets.&nbsp; What is a prophet?&nbsp;&nbsp;How should we read&nbsp;books like Amos, Hosea, Isaiah?&nbsp; Are there prophets today?&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the idea of a&nbsp;biblical prophet is very misunderstood.&nbsp; Prophets are not psychics and fortune-tellers; they are people who speak the word of the Lord and how it affects present-day situations.  Who would you call a modern day prophet?  Below&nbsp;are the Isaiah texts I will probably use for&nbsp;August 8th.&nbsp;   Isaiah 1:1 The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. 10 Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Listen to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah! 11 What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats. 12 When you come to appear before me, who asked this from your hand? Trample my courts no more; 13 bringing offerings is futile; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation-- I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity. 14 Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them. 15 When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. 16 Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil, 17 learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow. 18 Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; 20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.  Isaiah 5:1 Let me sing for my beloved my love-song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. 2 He dug it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; he expected it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes. 3 And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and people of Judah, judge between me and my vineyard. 4 What more was there to do for my vineyard that I have not done in it? When I expected it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes? 5 And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down. 6 I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and it shall be overgrown with briers and thorns; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it. 7 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the people of Judah are his pleasant planting; he expected justice, but saw bloodshed; righteousness, but heard a cry!

New moon and sabbath and calling of convocation-- I cannot endure solemn assemblies with iniquity. 14 Your new moons and your appointed festivals my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them. 15 When you stretch out your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood. 16 Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil, 17 learn to do good; seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphan, plead for the widow. 18 Come now, let us argue it out, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be like snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool. 19 If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land; 20 but if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken.  &nbsp;  Psalm 50:1-8, 22-23  1  The mighty one, God the LORD, speaks and summons the earth from the rising of the sun to its setting. 2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God shines forth. 3 Our God comes and does not keep silence, before him is a devouring fire, and a mighty tempest all around him. 4 He calls to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people: 5 "Gather to me my faithful ones, who made a covenant with me by sacrifice!" 6 The heavens declare his righteousness, for God himself is judge. Selah 7 "Hear, O my people, and I will speak, O Israel, I will testify against you. I am God, your God. 8 Not for your sacrifices do I rebuke you; your burnt offerings are continually before me. 22 "Mark this, then, you who forget God, or I will tear you apart, and there will be no one to deliver. 23 Those who bring thanksgiving as their sacrifice honor me; to those who go the right way I will show the salvation of God."  &nbsp;  Hebrews 11:1-3, 8-16  Hebrews 11:1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen. 2 Indeed, by faith our ancestors received approval. 3 By faith we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are not visible. 8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to set out for a place that he was to receive as an inheritance; and he set out, not knowing where he was going. 9 By faith he stayed for a time in the land he had been promised, as in a foreign land, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise. 10 For he looked forward to the city that has foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 11 By faith he received power of procreation, even though he was too old-- and Sarah herself was barren-- because he considered him faithful who had promised. 12 Therefore from one person, and this one as good as dead, descendants were born, "as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore." 13 All of these died in faith without having received the promises, but from a distance they saw and greeted them. They confessed that they were strangers and foreigners on the earth, 14 for people who speak in this way make it clear that they are seeking a homeland. 15 If they had been thinking of the land that they had left behind, they would have had opportunity to return. 16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God; indeed, he has prepared a city for them.  &nbsp;  Luke 12:32-40  32 "Do not be afraid, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. 33 Sell your possessions, and give alms. Make purses for yourselves that do not wear out, an unfailing treasure in heaven, where no thief comes near and no moth destroys. 34 For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. 35 "Be dressed for action and have your lamps lit; 36 be like those who are waiting for their master to return from the wedding banquet, so that they may open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks. 37 Blessed are those slaves whom the master finds alert when he comes; truly I tell you, he will fasten his belt and have them sit down to eat, and he will come and serve them. 38 If he comes during the middle of the night, or near dawn, and finds them so, blessed are those slaves. 39 "But know this: if the owner of the house had known at what hour the thief was coming, he would not have let his house be broken into. 40 You also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an unexpected hour."  &nbsp;

      I'm preaching&nbsp;two Sundays (August 1 and 8)&nbsp;in a row, so I am considering doing a two part series.&nbsp; It could be on the lectionary texts, it could be from some other part of the Bible, or it could be on a certain topic.&nbsp; What do you think? &nbsp; Hosea11:1-11 1 When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. 2 The more I called them, the more they went from me; they kept sacrificing to the Baals, and offering incense to idols. 3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, I took them up in my arms; but they did not know that I healed them. 4 I led them with cords of human kindness, with bands of love. I was to them like those who lift infants to their cheeks. I bent down to them and fed them. 5 They shall return to the land of Egypt, and Assyria shall be their king, because they have refused to return to me. 6 The sword rages in their cities, it consumes their oracle-priests, and devours because of their schemes. 7 My people are bent on turning away from me. To the Most High they call, but he does not raise them up at all. 8 How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, O Israel? How can I make you like Admah? How can I treat you like Zeboiim? My heart recoils within me; my compassion grows warm and tender. 9 I will not execute my fierce anger; I will not again destroy Ephraim; for I am God and no mortal, the Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath. 10 They shall go after the LORD, who roars like a lion; when he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west. 11 They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt, and like doves from the land of Assyria; and I will return them to their homes, says the LORD. &nbsp; &nbsp; Psalm 107:1-9, 43 1 O give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever. 2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, those he redeemed from trouble 3 and gathered in from the lands, from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south. 4 Some wandered in desert wastes, finding no way to an inhabited town; 5 hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted within them. 6 Then they cried to the LORD in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress; 7 he led them by a straight way, until they reached an inhabited town. 8 Let them thank the LORD for his steadfast love, for his wonderful works to humankind. 9 For he satisfies the thirsty, and the hungry he fills with good things. 43 Let those who are wise give heed to these things, and consider the steadfast love of the LORD. &nbsp; Luke 12:13-21 13 Someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me." 14 But he said to him, "Friend, who set me to be a judge or arbitrator over you?" 15 And he said to them, "Take care! Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one's life does not consist in the abundance of possessions." 16 Then he told them a parable: "The land of a rich man produced abundantly. 17 And he thought to himself, 'What should I do, for I have no place to store my crops?' 18 Then he said, 'I will do this: I will pull down my barns and build larger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 19 And I will say to my soul, 'Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years; relax, eat, drink, be merry.' 20 But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life is being demanded of you. And the things you have prepared, whose will they be?' 21 So it is with those who store up treasures for themselves but are not rich toward God." &nbsp; Colossians 3:1-11 Colossians 3:1 So if you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God. 2 Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, 3 for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. 4 When Christ who is your life is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in glory. 5 Put to death, therefore, whatever in you is earthly: fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry). 6 On account of these the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient. 7 These are the ways you also once followed, when you were living that life. 8 But now you must get rid of all such things-- anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive language from your mouth. 9 Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have stripped off the old self with its practices 10 and have clothed yourselves with the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of its creator. 11 In that renewal there is no longer Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave and free; but Christ is all and in all!

      Luke 10:38-42 &nbsp; 38 Now as they went on their way, he entered a certain village, where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. 39 She had a sister named Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and listened to what he was saying. 40 But Martha was distracted by her many tasks; so she came to him and asked, "Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me." 41 But the Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things; 42 there is need of only one thing. Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her." &nbsp; I graduated from the University of Iowa in May of 1993, with a Bachelor’s of Science and a well-rounded liberal arts education.&nbsp; When people asked me what I studied, I usually tell them Community Recreation.&nbsp; I took classes on designing city parks, managing facilities such as YMCAs and gymnasiums, and implementing recreation programs for people with disabilities.&nbsp; But Community Recreation was only one of the areas of study that made up the academic department that I was officially registered in.  &nbsp;  I graduated from the University of Iowa with a degree from the Department of Leisure Studies.&nbsp; Sounds pretty good, huh?&nbsp; I’ve heard all sorts of jokes about the kind of classes that a Leisure Studies major must take.&nbsp; Advanced Remote Control Usage.&nbsp; Napping Techniques From Around the World.&nbsp; The Physiology and Anatomy of Bowling.&nbsp; It’s even been said that you can fail a Leisure Studies class for showing up to class on a beautiful bright and sunny afternoon.  &nbsp;  Now, I’ve got a pretty good sense of humor and the ability to laugh at myself, so the jokes never really bothered me, and I’ll be the first to admit that my classes weren’t always the most academically rigorous ones out there.&nbsp; But before you dismiss Leisure Studies altogether I want to tell you about Dr. Benjamin Hunnicutt.&nbsp; Dr. Hunnicutt was a full fledged professor of Leisure Studies.&nbsp; He didn’t teach us how about the different types of lights with which to illuminate a night time softball field.&nbsp; Nor did he familiarize us with the characteristics of different populations so we could plan appropriate recreational activities.  &nbsp;  Dr. Hunnicutt made his living by studying leisure.&nbsp; And in the class that I took from him he took us through the concept of leisure as it had been viewed by different societies through time in Western society.&nbsp; One of the things I remember from this class is that one of Dr. Hunnicutt’s main areas of interest was the work week.&nbsp; Specifically, on the increasing nature of the American hourly work week.  &nbsp;  If I remember correctly, he told us that in modern history, up until the time of the Great Depression the hours in the American work week had steadily been decreasing.&nbsp; As technology advanced and was put to good use, the hours of work that were needed each week decreased.&nbsp; During the 1930s there was even a bill that was almost made law that would have mandated a thirty hour work week.&nbsp; But since that time, even though technology has obviously advanced, the work week has been increasing, and today we work more hours per week than ever before.  &nbsp;  When we talk about a work week we usually mean paid employment.&nbsp; But we need to add on to that the job of raising children, owning a house, preparing meals, taking care of a yard, getting kids to school activities, being part of a volunteer organization, serving on a church committee, going to the gym, and all those other areas of life that take up our time.&nbsp; Sometimes our home lives are so full of commitments that going to work may seem like a break.  &nbsp;  In the beginning of the class that I took from Dr. Hunnicutt I remember that we talked about how we are working more today than ever before, and then he promised an automatic A to anyone who could explain why.&nbsp; We talked about it for a while and didn’t come to any solutions, but we did come to a conclusion that we aren’t working longer hours today out of necessity.&nbsp; We realized that the technology and resources exist to provide for the needs of our entire society with much less work then we currently do.&nbsp; There was a feeling in the class that somehow, as a society and as individuals we choose to work more hours per week than ever before.  &nbsp;  I don’t know if this sounds strange to you, but it does to me a little bit.&nbsp; Carrie and I often have discussions about how little time we have for each other and ourselves.&nbsp; If we could choose to have more free time, surely we would make that choice!&nbsp; I’m sure many of you feel that you don’t spend enough time with your family and friends.&nbsp; I’m sure you would love to choose to work less and relax more.  &nbsp;  Sometimes we can get defensive when we are told that we spend too much time working.&nbsp; There may be someone in our life who cares about us, who simply tries to point out to us that we are working so much that it is hurting us or our loved ones.&nbsp; But when they tell us that we spend too much time working we hear it as an accusation.&nbsp; Maybe we immediately get defensive and try to convince them that we are working a lot, but not too much.&nbsp; Or maybe we agree with them.&nbsp; Yes, we are working too much, but what other choice do we have?&nbsp; Someone has to pay the bills!&nbsp; There’s work to be done and it isn’t going to get done by itself.  &nbsp;  In our gospel lesson for today, I can’t help but think this is how Martha felt.&nbsp; You think that you and I have a long work week?&nbsp; I wonder what Martha’s was like?&nbsp; Unlike many women of that day, Martha apparently owned her own home where she lived with her sister Mary.&nbsp; She had the responsibility for maintaining the home and overseeing all of the household affairs.&nbsp; Simple things, like preparing a meal,&nbsp; that you and I might consider “chores” were jobs that required a lot of work.  &nbsp;  For example, preparing a meal.&nbsp; If we want to eat, we go to the refrigerator, cupboard, or maybe the grocery store and gather a few things and cook them.&nbsp; But we could also order a pizza, a burger, a pre-made salad, or just munch on some things that we already have sitting around our house.&nbsp; Food is readily available and&nbsp; mostly prepared for us today.  &nbsp;  This wouldn’t have been the case for people in Martha’s time.&nbsp; You didn’t buy your food prepared.&nbsp; If you wanted some meat then you needed an animal to butcher.&nbsp; If you wanted bread then you ground some flour and baked the bread yourself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You could get fresh produce if you walked to the market (sometimes miles away) to get some.&nbsp; Want a glass of water?&nbsp; Then hopefully someone had already walked to the well or nearest stream and brought back a couple jugs.&nbsp; At that time, if you didn’t spend hours of time working on your meal then you didn’t eat!  &nbsp;  So when Jesus comes to dinner at Martha’s house, there is work to be done, or nobody eats.&nbsp; This is the situation in Luke 10.&nbsp; Martha is very busy trying to prepare a meal for Jesus, herself, her sister Mary, and possibly the disciples or other people who may have been there.&nbsp; And apparently Martha is doing this all by herself, because Mary sat down at Jesus’ feet to listen to what he was saying.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  Well, Martha doesn’t like this arrangement.&nbsp; She knows that there is a lot of work to be done and that somebody needs to do it.&nbsp; So she goes to Jesus and asks him to get Mary to help her.&nbsp; She tells him that it isn’t right that Mary gets out of the work and Martha has to do it all by herself.&nbsp; Martha doesn’t ask anything unreasonable.&nbsp; She isn’t trying to get out of her share of the work.&nbsp; She just wants a little help!&nbsp; This is very reasonable.&nbsp; But Jesus surprises us by telling Martha that she is worrying too much and that she is distracted by too many things, and then he says that Mary has done the better thing in this situation.  &nbsp;  I would imagine Martha was dumbfounded at Jesus’ response.&nbsp; I am sure that she expected that Jesus would make Mary get up and help get things ready.&nbsp; But instead, Martha is the one who is corrected by Jesus!&nbsp; Some people have said that Jesus rebukes Martha or scolds her.&nbsp; But I don’t think this is what Jesus did.  &nbsp;  Earlier when I was talking about how we can often work too much, I said that occasionally someone who cares about us very much may come to us and tell us that we spend too much time at work.&nbsp; And at that moment we may not react very well.&nbsp; It may seem like that person is being critical of us or scolding us, when what they are trying to do is help us see what we are doing to ourselves.&nbsp; I think this is what Jesus is doing with Martha.  &nbsp;  Notice what Jesus says in verses 41 and 42 and what he doesn’t say.&nbsp; He doesn’t say to Martha, you are doing the wrong thing.&nbsp; He doesn’t tell her that the work is unimportant.&nbsp; Jesus doesn’t say that her efforts are wasted or trivial.&nbsp; Instead he says that there is a better way; there are more important things.&nbsp; Jesus doesn’t say to her that she shouldn’t be working, instead he says to her that she shouldn’t be worried or distracted by her work.&nbsp; Martha’s problem is not the work that needs to be done, but the priority that she has given to the work.&nbsp; He problem is that she is using precious time that she could be spending with Jesus and doing work instead.  &nbsp;  There is no ending to this story found in the gospels.&nbsp; But I’d like to think that Jesus says to Martha, “Come here and sit for a while.&nbsp; Spend some quality time with me and with your sister.&nbsp; Forget about everything that needs to be done for a bit and let’s talk about important things.&nbsp; And then maybe we’ll all get up and work together on the other things.”  &nbsp;  The message that Jesus gives to Martha and to us is that it’s not about work being good or bad.&nbsp; It’s about priorities and the choices that we make about work, family, chores, leisure, and our time that matter.&nbsp; Work, or anything else for that matter, becomes a problem when it keeps us from God, when it keeps us from loving and serving God.&nbsp; If we are working so much that our relationship with God or our neighbors suffers, then work has become a problem!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So what’s the solution?&nbsp; Tomorrow morning should you go to your boss and tell him that you aren’t going to work on Fridays any more?&nbsp; Or that you won’t be coming into work until noon from now on?&nbsp; Maybe you should tell your spouse and your kids that every other day you are going to read a book, serve in the soup kitchen, or take painting lessons instead of cleaning the house and cooking meals. Well, it probably won’t be as easy as that (but then again, you never know until you try).&nbsp; But there are things that we can do.  &nbsp;  We can take a realistic look at our lives and we can see where work consumes us and where God is pushed out of our lives because of “more important” things.&nbsp; Is serving the church something that you try to fit into the gaps in your schedule or do you make a commitment to serving the church before scheduling other things?&nbsp; We say we need to pay the bills, but how much of the work we do is to pay the bills and how much to pay for an expensive new car, an extravagant trip, or some other luxury that we could do without?  &nbsp;  We all have limited amounts of time and money, so it comes down to what sort of choices are we going to make.&nbsp; What are we going to make a priority in our lives?&nbsp; As you think about choices, I invite you to listen to a story and choose which person you’d like to be.  &nbsp;  There was a wealthy businessman who was on his way to an afternoon meeting when he passed a church near the docks.&nbsp; Heading into the church was a fisherman with his daughter.&nbsp; The businessman stopped the fisherman and asked him why he was going into the church instead of out catching fish in the middle of the workday?  &nbsp;  The fisherman replied, "Because I caught enough fish for one day."&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "Why don't you catch some more?" the businessman asked  &nbsp;  When the fisherman asked why he should do that the businessman responded, "You could earn more money.&nbsp; Then with the extra money, you could buy a bigger boat, go into deeper waters, and catch more fish. Then you would make enough money to buy nylon nets. With the nets, you could catch even more fish and make more money. With that money you could own two boats, maybe three boats. Eventually you could have a whole fleet of boats and be rich like me."  &nbsp;  "Then what would I do?" asked the fisherman.  &nbsp;  "Then," said the businessman, "you could really enjoy life."  &nbsp;  The fisherman looked at the businessman quizzically, took his daughter’s hand lovingly and walked towards the church.&nbsp; Just before he entered, he stopped, turned to the businessman and said, "What do you think I am doing now?”  &nbsp;  In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.&nbsp; One God, Mother of us all. Amen.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Ok, so it may seem like no one except me is actually reading this because there are no comments to any of my postings.  But several of you have talked to me in person about things I have posted on here, so I know that there are people interested in this.  I'm cool with that.  Feel free just to lurk and read, to read and talk to me in person, or to post for everyone to read.  To each their own.  You may have noticed that I haven't been posting as often in my sermon writing process as possible.  This is mostly because my summer is kind of busy with trips.  I did a lot of thinking and some writing about my July 4th sermon while on the youth mission trip (just ask Dana and Emily, "Measure twice! Pray twice!").  Unfortunately, I'm going on vacation tomorrow so I won't be able to post my thoughts and work for my July 18th sermon.  Hopefully, in August things will settle down and I will be more faithful to posting my work on furture sermons.

      2 Kings 5:1-14  1 Naaman, commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man and in high favor with his master, because by him the LORD had given victory to Aram. The man, though a mighty warrior, suffered from leprosy. 2 Now the Arameans on one of their raids had taken a young girl captive from the land of Israel, and she served Naaman's wife. 3 She said to her mistress, "If only my lord were with the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy." 4 So Naaman went in and told his lord just what the girl from the land of Israel had said. 5 And the king of Aram said, "Go then, and I will send along a letter to the king of Israel." He went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten sets of garments.  6 He brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, "When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you my servant Naaman, that you may cure him of his leprosy." 7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes and said, "Am I God, to give death or life, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Just look and see how he is trying to pick a quarrel with me." 8 But when Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king, "Why have you torn your clothes? Let him come to me, that he may learn that there is a prophet in Israel."  9 So Naaman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the entrance of Elisha's house. 10 Elisha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean." 11 But Naaman became angry and went away, saying, "I thought that for me he would surely come out, and stand and call on the name of the LORD his God, and would wave his hand over the spot, and cure the leprosy! 12 Are not Abana and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?" He turned and went away in a rage. 13 But his servants approached and said to him, "Father, if the prophet had commanded you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more, when all he said to you was, 'Wash, and be clean'?" 14 So he went down and immersed himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; his flesh was restored like the flesh of a young boy, and he was clean.  Who do you depend on?  Where do you place your trust and confidence?  Two recreational hunters decided they wanted to go to Maine for a hunting trip.  They had never been to Maine but they heard it was a wonderful place for just such a trip.  One of the things they did in preparation for this trip was to hire a guide to take them into the backwoods.  They finally settled on a man who had a reputation for being accomplished and dependable.  He was known as the best guide in all of Maine.  The first day was great.  Good hunting, beautiful scenery.  The second day the hunters noticed that their guide seemed a little unsure of himself, but he didn’t say anything so neither of the hunters did.  But by the third day the guide confessed to them that they were hopelessly lost.  Immediately, they began to doubt and question the competence of their guide. Finally, one of the hunters confronted the guide, "You were supposed to be the best guide in all of Maine.  How could you get us lost!"  The guide replied, “Sir, I am the best guide in all of Maine, but I’m pretty sure we’re in Canada now.”  Who do you depend on?  Where do you place your trust and confidence?  In the fifth chapter of 2 Kings we read about the healing of Naaman.  As we take a closer look at this story we are invited to think about where we place our trust and who we depend on.  Naaman was a high ranking general in the army of Aram (known today as Syria).  Verse one says he was a great and mighty man.  The King of Syria looked favorably on Naaman and God had even given him victory over Israel.  So it would seem that Naaman was sitting on top of the world and had everything going for him, except that the scripture also tells us that Naaman had leprosy.  This wasn’t necessarily what we know as leprosy today, also known as Hansen’s disease, but it was some sort of painful and visible skin disease or infection.    In ancient Middle Eastern society to have a skin disease like Naaman’s meant that people looked down on you.  It would not have been an easy life for anyone, even a high class Syrian general.  It seems that Naaman is desperate for a cure.  When we pick up the story he is taking the advice of a foreign slave girl.  It would have been somewhat humiliating for a man such as Naaman to take advice from one of his servants, and this isn’t just any one of his servants, but a foreigner, someone from Israel, Syria’s enemy.  But Naaman is desperate so he listens to this girl as she tells him of a prophet of God named Elisha, who could cure Naaman of his disease.  Now you would think that Naaman would want to hurry to see Elisha.  Go right there and let God heal him through this man.  You would think so, but apparently Naaman doesn’t quite get it yet.  He doesn’t make a beeline for Israel and the prophet Elisha.  Instead he goes to see his King, the King of Syria.  And what happens when he arrives?  I’m sure that the King greeted him as a respected general.  There was probably a nice dinner and some state ceremonies.  But when all is said and done, Naaman arrives there with his disease and he leaves there with his disease.  The King of Syria has no cure.  I’m sure the King didn’t like this.  He was the King!  He was used to feeling important and being the most powerful man around, the highest authority.  But he couldn’t cure Naaman.  So he and Naaman decide that it isn’t enough to go to the prophet of God and simply depend on God for the cure.  No, they decide that Naaman is going to bring a load of silver, gold, and expensive clothes in order to buy the cure.  They put their trust in wealth and not in God.    Leighton Farrell was the minister of Highland Park Church in Dallas for many years. He tells of a man in the church who once made a covenant with a former pastor that they would both tithe ten percent of their income every year.  They thought it would be good to hold each other accountable for this area of faith.  At that time they were both young and neither of them had much money. But things changed. The layman tithed one thousand dollars the year he earned ten thousand, then ten thousand dollars the year he earned one hundred thousand, and then one hundred thousand dollars the year he earned one million. But the year he earned six million dollars he just could not bring himself to write out that check for six hundred thousand dollars to the church.  He telephoned the minister and asked to see him. When he walked into the pastor’s office the man begged to be let out of their covenant, saying, "This tithing business has to stop. It was fine when my tithe was one thousand dollars, but I just can’t bring myself to write a six hundred thousand dollar check to the church.  Do you know how much money that is? You’ve got to do something, Reverend!" The pastor knelt on the floor and prayed silently for a long time. Eventually the man said, "What are you doing? Are you praying that God will let me out of the covenant to tithe?" "No," said the minister. "I am praying for God to reduce your income back to the level where one thousand dollars will be your tithe!”  Money, in and of itself is not bad, but when we rely on it more than we depend on God then our trust is misplaced and we are sure to be disappointed.  This is what Naaman is doing.  He now has the blessing of his King and a small fortune and he thinks he is set.  So he goes to see the King of Israel, and eventually makes his way to see Elisha.  And he does so in style.  The Bible says that he arrives with his horses and chariots, basically the modern day equivalent of a nice limousine.  So now, Naaman is trying to impress Elisha.  Naaman is depending on his status to impress Elisha and bring about the cure he has been seeking.  Back then, much like today, status did count for something.  If you were an important person and you showed off your position and power, you could probably get special treatment.  But status only gets you so far.  Muhammad Ali found this out once.  When he was at the prime of his boxing career, Ali was on an airplane that was getting ready to take off and the stewardess politely said to him, "You need to fasten your seat belt." Ali smugly replied, "Superman doesn’t need a seat belt." To which the stewardess politely responded, "And Superman doesn't need an airplane either; please fasten your seat belt.”  No matter who you are, you’re only human.  And although Naaman tries his best, he quickly discovers that Elisha is not impressed.  Elisha sends a messenger out to Naaman with instructions.  He doesn’t go out to meet Naaman in person, he doesn’t invite him in, he send a servant out to give him these simple instructions, "Go, wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored and you shall be clean."  That’s it.  No elaborate rituals, no sacrifices, no burnt offerings.  In fact, Elisha isn’t even going to come out and take part in any sort of ceremony.  You can almost hear Naaman shouting at his servants, “I came all this way for some servant to tell me to jump in the nearest river!  You call this Jordan a river?!?  You should see the rivers in Syria!”  Naaman is angry, unimpressed, and surely disappointed.  Why?  Not because he isn’t going to be cured.  He’s closer to the cure than he has been yet.  No, he’s angry because he was expecting some elaborate ritual, and he believes that his homeland has so much more to offer than Israel!  Naaman’s disappointment comes from depending on ceremony and country, rather than on God.  It would be a sad ending to the story had Naaman left and gone back to Syria at that point.  But fortunately one of his servants realized that it wasn’t about wealth, power, status, ritual, country, or anything else but God.  He says to Naaman, “If the prophet had commanded you to do something difficult, would you not have done it? How much more, when all he said to you was, 'Wash, and be clean'?"  And Naaman washed, and he was clean.  He finally gave up and allowed God to heal him in the way that God had planned.  Naaman was healed of his leprosy and Naaman was also healed if his dependency issues.  Naaman’s eyes were opened and he learned not to depend on wealth, status, power, ritual, or country more than God.    As you know, today is July 4th.  228 years ago our country declared its independence from England.  Today is Independence Day, and we’ll celebrate it with picnics, cookouts, swimming, camping, fireworks, patriotic songs, and other fun times.  It’s fun to celebrate a day like today, because Independence Day only comes once a year.  But as Christians we need to remember another holiday that we celebrate: Dependence Day, and it happens every day of the year.  Because throughout our entire lived we need to place our trust in God before anything else, and depend on God for all our needs.     In the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One God, Mother of us all.  Amen.

      Here's the August 1st sermon.  I thought it was OK.  Maybe a little dry and maybe too lecture-ish, but I liked the basic idea.  When I conclude the series next week I'll try for a little more application and engagement with our day to day lives.  Amos 8:1 This is what the Lord GOD showed me-- a basket of summer fruit. 2 He said, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, "The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by. 3 The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day," says the Lord GOD; "the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place. Be silent!" 4 Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land, 5 saying, "When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances, 6 buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat." 7 The LORD has sworn by the pride of Jacob: Surely I will never forget any of their deeds. 8 Shall not the land tremble on this account, and everyone mourn who lives in it, and all of it rise like the Nile, and be tossed about and sink again, like the Nile of Egypt? 9 On that day, says the Lord GOD, I will make the sun go down at noon, and darken the earth in broad daylight. 10 I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation; I will bring sackcloth on all loins, and baldness on every head; I will make it like the mourning for an only son, and the end of it like a bitter day. 11 The time is surely coming, says the Lord GOD, when I will send a famine on the land; not a famine of bread, or a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD. 12 They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, seeking the word of the LORD, but they shall not find it.  Do you remember a number of years ago when Jeff Foxworthy started coming out with his jokes that all began, “You might be a redneck if…” and then most of the jokes ended with some sort of funny yet somewhat derogatory statement like “if you think fast food is hitting a possum at 65 mph.”  I’ll admit that I think a lot of those jokes are funny, but after living in the South for a couple of years I became friends with a number of self-proclaimed “rednecks” and most of those jokes just seem mean and untrue to me now.  But since Foxworthy’s original jokes there have been a number of other “You might be a _______ if” lists.  Just browsing around the internet I found these examples: You might be an accountant if…you refer to your child as Deduction 214.3. You might be a caffeine addict if…you can't remember the last time you blinked. You might be a bad driver if…you hit the car in front of you while backing up.  And finally, a few from “You might be from Michigan if…” You point to your hand to tell people where you live. If you tell someone you’re going “down south” and you mean Toledo. If parts of Canada are north of you. If your kid’s baseball game has ever been snowed out.  So, since there are all sorts of “You might be a _____ if” lists out there I thought I would come up with one of my own for this morning’s sermon.  And, I’ll let you know in advance it probably won’t be as humorous as the ones above.  But it should be interesting and hopefully you might learn a thing or two from… “You might be a prophet of God if…”  Now I chose the subject of prophets because in the Sunday lectionary readings this summer there are a number of passages from Old Testament prophets.  This morning I’ve chosen passages from Amos and Hosea, but there are also passages this summer from Micah, Isaiah, and Jeremiah.  For some reason we don’t seem to talk a lot about the prophets.  Sure, we’ll hear a couple of verses from Isaiah around Christmastime, but only the parts that we think have something to do with the birth of Jesus.  Rarely, do we spend much time studying or talking about the prophets on their own merits.  So, you might be a prophet of God if…you are speaking on behalf of God.  This is the basic one.  It doesn’t get much simpler than this.  The word prophet comes from the Greek word prophetes which means to speak on behalf of someone.  So a prophet of God speaks on behalf of God.  Now there are other kinds of prophets.  During the time of the Old Testament there is archeological evidence of prophets in ancient Assyria, Mesopotamia, and Egypt.  They weren’t prophets of the Jewish God but they were prophets, usually of the god or gods of their own religions.  But in our tradition, when we speak of a prophet, we mean someone who speaks on behalf of the God that we know from the Bible.  In our tradition we believe that God works directly in all of our lives.  We don’t believe that God only acts and communicates to certain people.  So even though we say that a prophet is someone who speaks on behalf of God, it doesn’t mean that the rest of us can’t communicate God’s will.   But we do recognize that there have been people in the Bible whom God has chosen to give a specific message, and God has asked them to deliver that message to God’s people in very specific words or ways.  Take Amos.  Amos was a farmer and a herdsman.  He worked the land and tended to sycamore trees.  But God came to him and told him “Go, prophesy to my people Israel.”  Imagine how you would feel if God came to you and gave you a vision and a message to bring to the world.  You’re Amos.  You’re out in the fields pruning the sycamore trees.  It’s a good line of work, nothing fancy, but it pays the bills.  When *bam* there’s a big ol’ basket of fruit floating before your eyes.  For us it might be apples, cherries, oranges, bananas, etc.  For Amos it was probably varieties of Middle Eastern fruit.  And then God speaks.  So now you’re standing there, listening to God’s voice, checking out a big basket of rotten fruit, and probably wondering if you’re hallucinating because you fell out of a sycamore tree and hit your head.  You’re questioning your sanity and then God tells you to go tell everybody else in your country what you’re seeing.  Yeah, right.  I wouldn’t even tell my own wife what I saw, let alone an entire nation.  Maybe you think I’m exaggerating Amos’ possible reaction.  Surely, God chose people who could handle the job better than that.  There was another prophet named Ezekiel.  He had some strange and wonderful visits from God too.  Here is his reaction after one of them from Ezekiel 3:14-15 “The spirit lifted me up and bore me away; I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me. I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who lived by the river Chebar. And I sat there among them, stunned, for seven days.”  It wasn’t easy being a prophet.  Getting these fantastic messages that you had to bring to God’s people.  Now, there is something that needs to be said about prophets and prophecy.  Usually, when we hear the word prophecy we think of future events being revealed.  We have a tendency to reduce a prophet to a psychic or a fortune teller, and we equate prophecy with prediction.  This is wrong.  The purpose of prophecy in the Bible is not to predict the future.  The purpose of prophecy is not to give us a roadmap for the future.  Now there are plenty of people out there who would tell you different.  When I was growing up Hal Lindsey’s book The Late Great Planet Earth was popular and he used Biblical prophecy to tell us that the world was going to end in 1988.  Whoops.  But this kind of understanding of prophecy goes back at least until the 1800’s.  When people like Jonathan Nelson Darby, D.L. Moody, and Cyrus Scofield began to formalize an understanding of prophecy called dispensationalism which lays out a very specific roadmap for the future second coming of Christ, sometimes day by day and week by week.  This understanding of prophecy continues today in the best selling Left Behind series.  Now I know a number of you have read and enjoyed the Left Behind books, and I’m not saying that they are bad books or that you shouldn’t read and enjoy them.  But please, take them for what they are, fiction.  In our tradition we don’t believe that the Bible is simply a puzzle to figure out and you can easily match writings that are thousands of years old with current events and situations to predict the future.  Prophecy in the Bible has much more to do with the time in which it was first delivered, than it does with our present or our future.  As we read the prophets we must keep in mind that they are addressing issues and events of their own day and society.  First and foremost, try to understand what was going on back then before you think of how to apply it to today.  Amos and Hosea were speaking to the people of Israel in the 8th century BCE, not to you and me.  Jeremiah was speaking to Israel just before the Babylonian exile in the 6th century BCE, not to you and me.  The book of Revelation was speaking to a group of frightened and persecuted Christians in the 1st century, not to you and me.  The Bible is entirely composed of writings written to specific peoples and specific times.  Now, this isn’t to say that the Bible doesn’t have a message to give to you and I today.  The Bible, and especially the prophets, have a lot to say to us today.  But in order to understand that message we must understand the time and place in which it was written, who it was written to, and what message was originally intended.   Let’s go back again to the vision and message that Amos received.  Amos 8:2 He said, "Amos, what do you see?" And I said, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the LORD said to me, "The end has come upon my people Israel; I will never again pass them by. 3 The songs of the temple shall become wailings in that day," says the Lord GOD; "the dead bodies shall be many, cast out in every place.  Be silent! 4 Hear this, you that trample on the needy, and bring to ruin the poor of the land, 5 saying, "When will the new moon be over so that we may sell grain; and the sabbath, so that we may offer wheat for sale? We will make the ephah small and the shekel great, and practice deceit with false balances, 6 buying the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of sandals, and selling the sweepings of the wheat."  This is a message originally intended for 8th century BCE Israel.   And the message was about their present, not their future.  If the only message that the people of Amos’ day were to hear was that in the future the end for the people of Israel was coming, then they would have missed the point.  Amos brought a message from God about Israel’s present.  God was saying, “Look what you are doing to the poor!  Every day you look for more ways to make money, more ways to take money from the needy.  You ask, “When will the Sabbath be over so we can start selling things again?”  You use counterfeit money and false weights for measuring.  You treat the poor among you as if they had no more worth than a pair of shoes.  How can any society continue like this?  Keep this up and you will destroy yourselves.”  So what message does this happen today?  Well, if we were to read this and think, “Wow.  This is predicting the destruction of modern day Israel because of their deceitful worship practices!”  We’d probably be wrong.  If we were to think, “This is predicting the destruction of America because we have become too greedy.”  We’d probably be wrong.  But if we were to think, “Back then, God told Israel they needed to take care of the poor and oppressed, and there would be dire consequences if they didn’t.  Maybe today, God still wants us to take care of the poor and oppressed, and maybe there will be dire consequences if we don’t.”  That’s a prophetic message that is as true today, as it was 3000 years ago.  It’s not psychic, it’s not a prediction, it simply reflects the timeless nature of God.  God cares for those in need.  Well, that was a lot of time spent on the first entry in You might be a prophet of God if.  Unfortunately, I don’t have time for the rest.  So let me give you a short preview of the rest of them, and if you can come back next week then you can hear about them in more detail.  You might be a prophet of God if…you are speaking the will of God to large groups and people in powerful positions, even the king himself!  You might be a prophet of God if…you upset these large groups and powerful people and they do things like: beat you, threaten to kill you, or throw you in a muddy hole for days on end.  You might be a prophet of God if…God has you doing strange things in front of large groups and powerful people.  Such as: eating a book, preaching naked, and naming your children such wonderful names as “Not My People” and “No Pity.”  Sound interesting?  Then, I’ll see you next Sunday.  In the name of The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost.  One God, Mother of us all.  Amen.
