						   What a wonderful day we had.  We ventured to Six Flags over Georgia.  It wasn't quite as I remember it when I was 20 years old...then again that was 16 years ago.  I can remember when I went as a kid, it was huge and exciting and I wanted to do everything and there was never enough time.  Now that I'm a little older, I am wondering what was so exciting.  But we still had  a great time.  Ken and I rode the Batman and the Superman.  Two very high tech rides than what we were ever used to.   I guess those old rickedy roller coasters were the fad of our times, but nothing compared to the Batman.  It was the best I have been on.  The Superman was okay but it was to short and not enough twists and turns for me.   It was great to walk through the amusement park with Ken.  We had a lot of fun.  Kimberly brought her friend Ashly and they went off to have their own fun.   It's funny, it has been a 1-1/2 that I have been living with Ken and his family.  I don't feel any different than the first time I met him, other than closer and absolutely comfortable.  I can tell Ken anything.  He's my bestfriend and still till today, he looks at me and I still melt.  I guess that is because we continue to work on our relationship, remember being friends is important and to accept the ups and downs.  But to pay attention to those moments and recognize them.  Don't discard them, rather handle them at the moments time and not dwell on them.   Tomorrow I will have to work on our computers.  Yes, we have a virus in the systems.  So, I guess that means for the next few days I'll have to back everything up, reformat the drives and get us up and going again.  Ken has a class this weekend to attend for the firearms training and we are planning a huge bar b que for everyone attending.  I, of course, will be cooking on the grill, some ribs and make a few salads.  I enjoy people so very much and love to entertain.  We have a local range we belong to and truly enjoy being with others with the same hobbies in firearms and competitions.   Well, it has been a long day and I think I am going to turn in.  Until I write again.  Peace

						   I suppose I am getting a little sleepy.  I thought I would go to bed but I couldn't stop messing around with the formatting of this new blog.  I have had a cold for the last few days and have slept in for most of the day today.  I'm tired but I'm not sure if I can actually get to sleep.  I will try.   We are going to Six Flags tomorrow.  It should be fun.  My fiance`, Ken, who you'll hear about from time to time in my postings is taking me along with his daughter and her friend.  I haven't been there for over 10 years.  I'm sure the rides have changed.  I love rides.   Well, I suppose I had better tuck myself in to bed.  Until I write again.  Peace

						    I suppose we all need an outlet. Why not write. I am an artist who's time has come and gone and has come and went and who sees and sees again. Of course, none of this mumbo jumbo may make any sense to anyone other than me, but that is fine. I'm not writing for the world other than my own artistic expressional outlet. Andy Warhol said it best in that we are all famous for at least 15 minutes once in our lives or "They say that time changes things, but you actually have to change them yourself". My life is ever changing. I suppose by writing I can keep up with it. I enjoy painting and drawing. The artist inside of me, no matter what my career is, no matter what my social status is, no matter what face I paint on, the one thing I am certain is that I am an artist. Funny, I once had someone write to me and tell me that they are able to tell what mood I was in while I was working on my art. I am an artists who's emotions goes in to her work. I'm very easily read.  Until another time I write.  Peace
