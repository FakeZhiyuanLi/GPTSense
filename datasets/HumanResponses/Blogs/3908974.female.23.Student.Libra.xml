      It's been a while.  I have been unable to sleep lately.  During the day, I stay busy enough to forget about the things that worry me--My debts, my questionable future as an academic, my very questionable ability to be a professional writer.    My life on the eve of graduating college is turning out to be a lot less than I thought it would be.  I'm staying in Kansas for grad school, and I applied so late that I might not even get a teaching position.  It's been over a year since I got laid, or even kissed someone for that matter.    I met another insomniac, actually someone I've known for a few months in connection to my roommate.  He's quite my opposite, in so many ways it's a laugh.  I mean, just pick something that I despise and he loves it.  Hair rock?  It's on his stereo.  Conservatism?  He's a big shot in KU's chapter of College Young Republicans.  I bet he even wears briefs.  It's uncanny how faultlessly I pick out the last person in the world I should seek a relationship with and get a big fat crush on him.  I could almost be doing this on purpose.  Anyway, we stayed up all night together on Monday and drank bad coffee, drove all around aimlessly, went to the Capitol, peed at a Walgreens.  The first thunderstorm of the year rolled in as we headed home.  I felt it, the feeling of something weightless at the base of my spine, the beautiful semi-sickness in my stomach.    I don't know if I can take falling for the wrong person again.    And to make matters even more complicated, my roommate used to be absolutely in love with this guy.  She has a boyfriend she's been dating for seven years (she's 22, do the math), but she burned a candle for this one for a year.  I think she will scratch out my eyes if I lay a hand on him.  At this point, I think she wants to thwart the romance, as if I couldn't thwart it myself completely on accident.

      I've actually had to WORK at work today, and I am not very pleased.  Haven't had time to read or write or fill in my blurty or anything...  Yesterday was kind of weird.  Had to go retrieve my television from the pawn shop.  I'd never been to one before, then I got in a bind a couple of weeks ago.  Tried to give plasma, but this town is the Midwestern Hub for the Homeless, and there was a line four days long.  Some of the people I passed in the waiting room looked like they'd been sucked dry.  Bad skin, dull hair and unfocused eyes.  I might have done it in spite of the wait, even though I'm so afraid of needles that I've put nurses in headlocks before just getting bloodwork done.  But then I saw someone in the lab behind the counter hold up the instrument they use to take the plasma.  I won't call it a needle!!  No, it's like a fucking PIPE as big around as a knitting needle and four inches long.  One look at it and I got tunnel vision and had to breathe in breathe out and find my "special place" just to drive myself back home.  So I had to put my tv in hoc, because I am a chickenshit.     I am BROKE after all those grad school application fees, then I didn't get any student loans because my status changed back to "dependent" after the Big Divorce.  And, of course, I'm prone to spending anyway.    So I got the tv back, which is a relief because it's the only thing I have besides an imac worth more than fifteen bucks.  Now my roommate can watch Friends again (which I hate), and it will be a Peaceable Kindom.    No Lucinda Williams.  Her mom died.  I really wanted to see her.  The next concert I'm for sure attending is David Bowie, and he's more of a novelty.  I dig the music, but the reason my friend got me a ticket is that it's common knowledge in my circle that my first crush ever was on David Bowie when he played the evil wizard in Labyrinth.  I was maybe six?  I watched that movie again last year, and I was surprised at how much he looks like a woman.  All that big hair and eye shadow.  (?)  I also thought MacGyver was hot, and he had a mullet.  Can't help the eighties I guess.   Anyway, no other big events pending.  I just found out I get to see Bart from Oregon, who let me and my dad stay at his place when we were in Eugene to see the Grateful Dead.  I still remember the banana slugs in his backyard where we pitched our tent, and the way he had ticket stubs as wallpaper in his kitchen.  And the "happy cookies" he made, which I now understand were made with hashish.  I was only 12 then.  The day after we got back to Manhattan, I started junior high.  What a trip!  I wonder if he'll recognize me.  I used to be such a little eyesore.  Now people say I look like my mom, which is well with me.    I try not to care too much how I look because in time, I will be tucking my tits in my pants and thinking blue is a complimentary color for my hair.  I want to have something else going on besides the look.  But it's hard sometimes.  I'm always on a fucking diet, even though the rational part of me knows I'm not fat.  I'm tempted to spend money on contact lenses so I don't have to dork around in glasses anymore.  And I waste way too much time wondering what other people see when they look at me.    If I could be like a guy in one respect, it would be the relative lack of concern they have for appearances--They're OWN, at any rate.  I see old guys all the time who still think they look dashing in formal wear they wore twenty years and twenty pounds ago.  Buttons bust off, and it's the PANTS' fault, not their fault for having huge pendelous guts.  Women cry and berate themselves and go pay doctors tosuck their asses off with long needles when faced with similar situations.  What a world!

      Okay, Blurty, you better not eat this one.  I am so god damned tired today!  Woke up at six a.m., which is a miracle because I never see the sunrise unless I stay up all night.  Had a nightmare featuring Mexican food, my boss, and a missile silo with a high powered elevator.  I couldn't shake the feeling of careening down an industrial elevator shaft miles below the surface of the earth until I'd cleared off a cup of tar black coffee.  My boss is whistling and I think I am going to squash his stupid fat head.  Why is it that people whistle?  They do it when they're in a fancy free mood, but everyone who has to hear it goes dark and stormy and homicidal after a few minutes.  Now he's immitating Elvis.   I guess I should consider myself lucky because I am "working" right now, and most people would get canned for sitting around filling in their blurties on the clock.    Finally opened my credit card bill today.  I'd been scared to confront the magnitude of my debt and admit to myself that my net worth is many thousands of dollars in the negative.  I'd left the envelope on my desk, in my backpack, on the kitchen counter.  When I finally decided that I had to at least know, I looked inside.  It's not as bad as I thought, but I won't be going out to eat or drink or do ANYTHING except sit at home in the dark and eat ramen noodles.  So, boys and girls, if anyone ever reads this but me, be warned:   DO NOT  get a credit card while you are in college.  It will be the death of you, unless you're ultra responsible and don't like to go out to the bar with your friends.  I'm going to see Lucinda Williams in Kansas City this weekend with my friend Craig.  He's 45, one of my dad's first students.  Now he's sort of a friend of the family.  He's the consummate bachelor.  Wears nothing but blazing red (Cheifs) and royal purple (K-State Wildcats) sweatshirts with food stains on them.  Drinks Budweiser in the morning, always has a five o clock shadow.  I cleaned house for him a couple of times to pick up some money and to help him lure prospective mates into his apartment.  Tell me this:  How does a man shit on the BOTTOM of his toilet?  And what kind of substance could be on a kitchen floor that would require removal with an ice scraper?  But Craig, in spite of his flaws, is a great guy with a kind heart, and his disgusting qualities are very endearing to me.

      All the sudden it's turned spring, and the sun's out, and all the nazi barbies on campus are donning their halters and mini skirts.  I sound so bitter, but I'm really not.  I am just so ready to move on to the next part of my life that college has lost its magic.  Please let lady luck smile on me and let me get accepted to grad school somewhere far away.  Got my first rejection letter from Montana yesterday, the same day my roommate got her acceptance letter from Yale.  It was hard to smile at her good fortune when I felt like drowning myself in the toilet.    Went to visit my parents this weekend in Manhattan.  It's funny how much I enjoy their company now that I'm older.  When I was living with them, and even for a few years after, our visits felt forced and uncomfortable.  I looked forward to seeing them about as much as I'd look forward to getting a root canal.  But now it's like we've gotten past all the horror of me being a teenager, and everything's fine.  Especially now that I'm not married anymore.  They thought John was an asshole from the beginning, and he thought they were highbrow professors out to make so-called normal folks feel inadequate.    I call my dad a rock and roll dad.  He's of the baby boom generation, and he came of age in the sixties in that golden time when the youth felt like they could actually fight against the tide of assholism and change the world for the good.  He's a smoker and a drinker, and he teaches Walt Whitman and Human Rights Literature.  Around Christmas, little kids approach him because he looks like Santa Claus, then their parents drag thjem away because they can see that my dad is a bearded old hippie with bifocals on.  Manhattan is the epitome of a Bible Belt Kansas town.  Guys with beards are generally seen as the fringe element, even if they do work at KSU.  I wonder sometimes why my parents wanted to live there.  My mom died when I was in second grade.  What I remember is that she was alternately shy and over the top.  She had this pained expression she wore all the time, and her brow would be knit up in concern.  People tell me I have inherited this look, though I couldn't tell you for sure.  She was, as I said, shy and self effacing, but she had a hidden strength and a surprising temper.  She was an artist, and she could knead a piece of clay as big as an infant.  And when she was mad, she might calmly walk out of a door, then slam it so hard she dragged the whole frame down with it.  I still have some of her art, and I think she was gifted at what she did.  I wonder what she'd have done if she'd lived past 35.  My stepmom is cool, too, and she's been around for ten years.  I didn't take to her in a hurry, though.  It was a rough gig seeing her with my dad, especially since I was 13 at the time.  She was born in the Republic of Congo, back when it was Zaire.  Her parents are heavy into the Coventant Church, and they were in Africa to help save the heathens.  Naomi's the Black Sheep of the family, even though she has a Ph.D. from Duke and teaches Children's Literature.  Her and my dad make a strange pair.    No brothers or sisters, just me and my folks.  I have an aunt somewhere in Iowa, and a cousin here in Lawrence.  He's a vagrant and he looks like the old Jim Morisson, when he stopped being the hottest man alive and started being a hairy alcoholic who exposed himself.  Last time I saw him, I went to a coffee house and he was sitting there, hunched over a cup of coffee.  I tried to talk to him, but he made no sense.  Said he was living in a tent at Pamona Lake, but who knows?  I thought I saw him slouching around the Salvation Army Soup Kitchen a time or two.  I wanted to make friends, because family is important and all, but I kept thinking about how he'd been chased out of Iowa because he beat his girlfriend and how he borrowed money all the time.  I haven't seen him, but I know I will someday.  That's one thing I do know about family--They keep turning up.

      At work again, bored to tears, but somehow unable to force myself to do homework.  I have a pile of long winded ancient texts to read for Western Civ. and "Quest for the Grail."  Seems like I've lost my will to slog through it.   Another gray day today, but at least it's Friday.  I talked to Justin last night, a guy I dated briefly after my divorce.  "Good on paper," he was.  Good looking, successfully employed as some kind of executive who wears a suit, a degree in industrial engineering, knows how to play the guitar.  And he wasn't even a jerk.  He's still not a jerk, even after I strung him along and dumped him.  I feel stupid for not being able to have feelings for him, but what can I do?  I tried.  At least we're still friends. The thing is, I like boys who are bad for me.  My first date here in Lawrence was at the Salvation Army free meal cafeteria, not too long after I moved here.  I ate plain lettuce and powdered mashed potatoes next to old guys with liver lips and fleas, all the while making eyes at the scrawny little bad boy across from me.  I liked tramping around with him, smoking cigarettes under the bridge and drinking cheap wine on my porch.  I liked the feeling that we were kind of operating under the radar of the normal and the mainstream, like Sid and Nancy.  The only problem was that he was kind of dumb.  Half the time he had no idea what I was talking about. The next couple of boyfrieds were pretty bad, too.  Guys with warrants, bad credit, no cars.  Guys who, in their middle twenties, saw nothing wrong with traipsing around town in the small hours of the morning, tripping acid with an eighteen year old girl.  Now that I'm 23, these guys seem even more absurd.  God knows what became of them.  I saw one working as a host at a restaurant downtown, bald as an egg and fat now. The Big Love of my life, the one who became my husband...He was more together than all the rest of them combined, but I'd venture to say he was the worst.  Broke me into little bitty pieces, and this was after he hammered out all my dents and left me wondering who the fuck I was.  I feel better now, and I can pretty much say I'm glad to be alone for once.   I used to get so lonesome when I was free, but now it suits me just fine.

      Okay, this is the first time I've tried using an online journal, but since I have a really easygoing campus job, I spend most of my workday doing crosswords or playing solitaire on the computer until my eyes feel like they're going to pop out.  I am a proud employee of the State of Kansas.  It's raining here today, so dull and depressing.  Kansas is such a pisser when the snow clears out.  Everything is either light brown or gray, save for all the gaily colored garbage strewn around.  I live in what's called the Student Ghetto here in Lawrence, but it's not really a ghetto.  Mostly it's just the children of middle class Kansans living on top of each other in slummy apartment complexes or crooked old houses.  I'm a senior this year, and I've kind of lost my flair.  Instead of getting dressed up all nice and combing my hair like I used to, I find that pajama pants are a comfortable alternative, and nobody looks at my hair anyways.   I ate eggrolls for breakfast and they're sitting in my stomach like a pile of rocks.  Later tonight I have my fiction class.  My major's Creative Writing.  Seems like a waste of time, considering the fact that most people become writers by actually writing instead of sitting around scratching their a-holes in workshops.  But Lord knows I need as much help as I can get, and if the university wants to give me three 500 level credits for writing stories, that's fine with me. I hope I get into graduate school.  I've applied all over, but the only one that's responded thus far is Minnesota State at Mankato.  I've never been to Minnesota, but it looks about like Kansas, from the pictures.  Maybe more trees, which would be a relief.  After graduate school, I want to go teach somewhere, and write books.  But sitting here at the computer in my pajamas and a raincoat, hopes like that seem far fetched.  My boss is coming...Must look busy.

      So tired!  I only have eight minutes left until the end of my shift, and I think I'm stuck in a time warp.  I swear I just saw the clock hands moving backwards a bit.  Stayed up all night with my boy again.  He's only like a year and change younger than me, but it feels like more.  But I wouldn't call him "my boy" to his face.  I'm really sweet on him, so much that it slays me to look at him.  Slays in a good way. (?)  We half assed watched The Big Lebowski for the nth time, then we got a little cozy and missed most of it.   I really relate to The Dude, though.  If I were a guy, I would be just like that.  He's my alter ego or something.  I won some writing award in a contest I forgot I entered.  I get a cash prize!  Now I can pay off all my god damned parking tickets!  It feels so good to get affirmation like that.  Maybe I'm a fool, but sometimes I really think I am going to make it.  And usually I'm so jaded all the time.  But for now I'm riding this wave of optimism, and it's only a couple of weeks till I go to the ceremony and get the check.  It's for $250.  Nice.  So tired!  Did I mention that?  I had to write a paper this morning before class.  In my estimation, it will probably get a B, but it was total crap.  It was over St. Thomas Aquinas, which was so treacherously boring to read that I wanted to chuck it into the john.  And then the paper!!  I kept seeing rainbows in front of my eyes while I was writing it.  Like looking through a prism.     I'm not making sense at all.  At least I cleared off these last few minutes...

      Bad day at work yesterday.  Bosses talking about my fat ass a lot.   I felt homicidal for a while, now I guess I'm fine.  The job's so perfect for a student that I don't feel like hassling with the implications of telling these guys to go fuck themselves or god forbid setting the affirmative action machine in motion.  But it was a bad day.    I've been spending a lot of time with my new man lately.  Kind of letting other things go to the wayside.  My life as a single was so peaceful and well rested.  I used to sit on a pile of pillows in my closet and read for hours.  I used to sleep for like eight or nine hours every night.  But everything with him is all shiny and intense.  The night hours are too magic to sleep through.  I love this part of being with someone.  I wish the days of this happy insanity weren't always so numbered.  But before we know it, we'll be routine.    Still pretty certain I am going to get heartbroken, but what the hell.  That's no reason to avoid it.  It's all pretty and spring here.  Flowers everywhere.  Ran and shine.  Today it's rain, which I like better.  I walked to school swinging my patriotically colored umbrella and hopping in puddles.  I feel so alive.

      Jesus I'm in a weird mood.  I feel like everything's so abrasive right now.  My clothes, the smell of food, the noise of cars, the constant presence of other people hanging about.  I've been sleeping like shit lately, waking up all twisted in my blankets with my shirt wadded up around my neck.  Dreams about working menial jobs and humiliating sexual encounters with seedy men that look like shoe salesmen.  Kind of casts the morning in a tacky light, waking up from scenes like that.    So now I'm in the computer lab on campus, and I think I will go get some water and drive around in my truck listening to music until I know my house will be empty.  What a weird mood I'm in.  Not fit for human consumption.

      Life has taken a strange turn since I last visited my blurty.  Since I found out I'm sticking around in Kansas, I've been as irresponsible as I can possibly be without losing my job or getting bad grades.  Which basically means that I've been on a bender since Spring Break.  I feel as if the break itself is still going, except for the eight hour distraction of school and a job.  I have barely slept recently, and the upshot of that is that my subconscious mind is sneaking up into my waking hours, turning the world into some kind of hazy circus that makes no sense.  I feel like I'm disconnected from myself, like my eyes are windows and I'm looking out.  The problem of the Big Crush has subsided somewhat now that he and I have established a mutual interest in each other.  It seems like there's always a period when emotions are running so high, when everything seems to be at stake.  It's the most exciting thing, starting out and being so uncertain.  It's the thrill of the possibility of being shot down, then the awe and relief of being embraced instead.  But it's so hard after a while, and when it finally starts to come into focus, it's never too early.  Not like I have much experience.  Just one, but that was enough.  I am not sure about him, not yet.  But I like him like crazy and I'm just trying to roll with it.  We're so different that we can't help ourselves.  My roommate, bless her, has undergone a complete turnaround.  I was about to just go become a nun because I didn't want to be the kind of girl who pisses on her friends for the sake of a man.  But she's been very supportive lately, and we're still tight.  That makes me feel better than anything.  I want to write more, but I have to work--

      At work again.  I don't bore easily, but I'm getting there.  I've read the paper, eaten a bag of baked doritos, checked my e-mail a million times, read The Poisonwood Bible, painted my nails trailer trash pink, crocheted most of a scarf.  And I still have 2 1/2 hours to go.  Last night I went to a cookout at my good time friend's house.  I like her a lot, but I am not a keg party kind of person.  She's one of those girls with the cel phone that's always ringing, and she's always yelling into it, "DUDE!  AWESOME!  Where are you?"  So different from me and my milder ways.  I had a few beers and then got bored trying to make conversation with the pair of alien looking sorority girls and the lone snobby theater chick who sat next to me on the porch.  Most everyone else was way too cool, with dreadlocks and patchy pants and guitars slung over their shoulders.  That's the Lawrence uniform--It's a happening town.  I used to be into that, but now I just figure I'd rather not spend my time and money cultivating a style.  Seems to me I look fine anyways, but you can't tell what I'm about just by looking at me.  Anyway, the party made me feel like I used to in the cafeteria at highschool, a lonesome yet very obvious misfit looking for a place to park her tray.  I left abruptly and drove around in my truck singing Janis Joplin tunes.  I was drunk.  After that, I went home and tried to pretend I was sober enough to read the New York Times.  All the troubles of the world, the war in Iraq, Sudan, floods in Haiti...It all bled together.  My roommate came home and we went out to some anonymous chain restaurant in the newer part of town and had a few more beers because she's leaving soon.  There's a heightened terror alert on, if that's to be believed.  What good is it to put it on the news?  All we can do is go buy more duct tape and canned peaches.  (Christ I hope nothing happens to her while she's over there.)   We sat on our stoop like old times and drank wine and watched a storm roll in.  Smoked nearly a pack and got a little mushy.  Her and my man are such close friends that things have been weird lately, and I've felt like a bad person for stealing him away.  I told her so, and she just laughed.  She said she takes credit for our nauseating bliss because she facilitated the hooking up.  I gather she encouraged him to respond to my clumsy overtures and warded off other males who thought they wanted to know me better.  I had no idea.  In fact, I had the distinct impression that she was disdainful.  We talked about all kinds of stuff, including the fact that we have a mild drinking problem.  I suppose I have put her a bit to the side lately, but I will make sure to make time for her more.  I told her I'm sorry for being off in Boyville lately but I'll be back.  I am considering becoming a police officer.  Lawrence needs them, and I've been onto it since I read this story in the latest Harpers about a romance between two cops, done as an episodic sketch surrounding the petty crimes they had to fight throughout the day.  I saw a headline in our local paper that the LAPD is hiring.  I would love to do public service like that, and I think I am good in a crisis.  I'd thrive on it.  My only issue with it is that my family, friends, and I all enjoy a pipe now and again.  I think prosecuting harmless drug users is a waste of time and resources.  Other than that, I really feel drawn to it.    There is an open house for the recruitment of female officers next week.  I'm going.  It's kind of like striking out into the unknown, leaving the cradle of academia.  But maybe this could be a good thing for me.

      Stormed like mad last night.    All day clouds were parked over northeast Kansas, turning the weather all gray and sticky and foreboding.  Everyone I talked to said they felt something coming.  Since nothing much ever happens here, the local news was having a fit about it, throwing up pictures of radar and safety warnings and recorded calls of old ladies reporting possible twisting formations they saw from their kitchen windows.  A tornado can kill you.  It can take away your possessions.  It can pull down the walls around you but leave your cup unspilled on your coffee table.  But all we got was rain, which in some perverse way disappointed me.  I want to be stripped of everything sometimes.  I am poor with day to day trivialities and I am slightly socially inept-- I am not punctual.  But I am good in  danger.    It rained harder than it has in years.  The last time it rained like that was the year I ran away from home, can it really be six years ago?  I remember at the time I thought it was a sign.  (I have always been strangely religious for an atheist.)  It rained until the streets looked like rivers.  It was practically Biblical.  I moved here with my best friends from my hometown, and we always did bizarre things just to be doing bizarre things.  It rained so much that we gave up on being dry and just walked around outdoors in our bathing suits.  I was lonesome and estranged from my family, and I was officially a high school dropout.  If I stopped being silly long enough to acknowledge these facts, I would feel a big windy hole in my chest.  (And thunder ripping above me all the while.)  But in the end the sun came out.  I am sure I missed out on a lot of good things in doing what I did, but since I'll never know what I missed, I feel fine.  (The road not taken, I suppose.)  My man was acting kind of weird last night.  We made cookies for my roommate, which was a disaster and not even worth the headache...We had to leave some of them in the oven while we helped contain our friend's cats and hide out while the storm was on.  They turned hard and brown in our absence.  And then she came home-- No love there, we're still in the doghouse for reasons I am losing patience with.    But my man...I thought something was wrong and it made me nervous.  We drove about in the rain, and when we hit campus, I started getting nostalgic about the last time we had a good rain.  I said, Let's go outside!  And there we were, running knee deep through rainwater, with cold drops pelting us so I couldn't stop shrieking from the excitement.  Lightning lit up the sky.  I hope nothing's wrong.  I hope it's not, because in spite of myself, I am all tangled up.  In ways, love is like letting someone hold a blade to your throat.  I have to believe he won't cut me.  But even the slightest thing makes me worry that he will.  I know I am wrong, and that it's probably nothing, and it's unfair to make him pay for what others have done to me.  Gun-shy girl slept alone last night.  Today begins my project of self denial.  I put it so dramatically, but the bottom line is I am going on a diet.  I ate my hundred calories this morning and I packed my apple for lunch...I felt so miserable and the hunger pains haven't even started yet.  But I've put on a few and I've been wearing big fat man's pants and the last time I saw a photograph of myself, I said "Who the hell is that?  So it begins today...

      Yesterday was a dreamboat of a day, one I will remember for a long time.  The sun was out and everything was bright and green.  Commencement was happening, and the town was full and music was playing in the streets, but my man and I walked on the periphery of it all.  We woke up in the afternoon and bathed each other and stood out on his balcony and drank chai. We washed my truck and took pictures of each other and ate Chinese food while doing a crossword.  We rented movies and forgot to watch them.  We ran in the dark on a track that wove through the woods, and there were lightning bugs and wild grasses and the moon was up.  We went home and tossed around in bed then went out and drank beer and laughed at each other.  It's a charmed life.  This weekend was all a blur.  I was so tired and strung out from wild night after wild night, and then having to work early every morning.    Dreamed I was killed in a high school shootout.  Highschool was like some underground cinemax thing.  Demon incarnates that acted surprisingly like real sixteen year old boys orchestrated a game of dodge ball with guns. They murdered me and I went straight to hell, but hell wasn't too bad.  Just a cottage with cobblestones and a lawn that needed mowing.  Had an orgy in there with an older lady who wore a tie dyed shirt and some hunks from the movies.    Dreamed I was in the woods with a woman like the witch from Snow White, a pale black hearted queen.  She grew mold on her face, green like the stuff that grows on grapefruits.  She shriveled away in quicktime.   Gave my stepmother a simple card and a "Bush/Cheney 1984" sticker for a late Mother's Day.  I am so horrible at keeping up with that stuff.  I rarely remember holidays except x-mas, and I have a poor sense of social etiquette.  I couldn't give a shit if I get thank you notes or birthday cards or whatever.  But my stepmother, bless her, really does care about that stuff.  I have to remember that.  She really liked even the small overture I made.  It was so easy, and I felt like a dick for not putting out more effort for people I love.  Same thing with my roommate.  She was hurt and angry about the lack of a party on her graduation last night.  She said she didn't want to make a big deal out of it, but we should have known that there should have been something more than a handful of people in a room with beer.  So lesson learned, I hope.

      So I'm done with another semester, and it went by so fast!  For some reson I want to calculate things today.  I smoked approximately 950 cigarettes, drank at least 180 diet cokes and 120 cups of coffee.  I've eaten probably 35 salads from the union.  (And yet no food poisoning!)  I wrote over a hundred pages in assigned work, not counting my other stuff.  Won't bother trying to figure how many pages I read and beers I had.   Suffice to say it was a lot.  Spent all night last night writing.  Second night in a row, and it was like old times with my roommate.  We developed this bizarre ritual last semester when we were both really getting schooled.  I was taking 18 hours of grad level stuff, and she was writing some big scary honors thesis.  We'd come home after work and go on these paper-writing benders where we'd put on our pajama pants and make pots of coffee and take hourly breaks to go stand out on the stoop and freeze our asses off while we smoked.  Sometimes there would be wine, which made my papers entertaining.  We'd do this for days in a row, sleeping maybe two or three hours a night until we got so addled we could hardly make sense anymore.  We'd start laughing for no reason.  I had tunnel vision sometimes.  It's funny what you miss, isn't it?  I had a big revision due today for a teacher I like very much and whose opinion I value a lot.  I'm really pleased with what I came up with in the deep hours of last night, but I'll be happy when I've handed it to him and I don't have to think about it for a while.  I read one of his books last weekend.  It was goddamn good.  Made me laugh.  It got a lot of acclaim when it came out, but I don't think he's put out much since, and it's been a while.  In any case, I am lucky I get to study with this guy.  We're doing a directed study this summer, and he already said that our primary project will be to polish up some of my existing work and get it published somewhere.  (!)  My only publications thus far have been in tatty local magazines.  My dad called last night at about 1:00, which is really late for him.  Usually my folks cash in around ten because they get up at the crack of dawn, even on the weekends.  I'd accidentally speed dialed him while I was out and about.  He left a message that went like this:  "Hello Daughter.  Are you calling me or are you really calling me?  Did you fall asleep and roll over on your phone again?  Are you in a ditch somewhere?  Well.  This is your old man.  Call me back."  I really love the hell out of my dad.  I didn't write this before because I did not want to think about it, but I saw a bit of the Nick Berg beheading .  It's been a few days, but sometimes when I close my eyes I still see that anonymous hand holding that poor kid's head, his slackened face.  Christ what a horrifying way to die.    Please let me be fortunate enough to go easy, in a car wreck or a hunting accident, or sudden one morning, maybe just dropping to the floor and quitting before I even realize it.    On that note-

      This is supposed to be another paper, but no, I'm not ready to do that at all.  I just took a HUGE test and I feel like writing other things, things that aren't for a grade, things that won't be read by anyone I know.    My man came to see me yesterday eve.  He's very fine.  Fine in the face, with a killer smile and nice hands and almost black eyes.  Many months ago, when I first met him, I thought he was a cutie.  It took me a while to wonder what else he might be.   Before this new thing, I was infatuated with a barista who works at a trendy coffee place downtown.  One of those bad boys with long hair and a leather jacket, wears sunglasses even when it's dark.  I vaguely knew him from a class, and I knew he was into English because he was always lingering around the shithole building where all the literature classes are booked.  He walks like Robert Plant and he wears decidedly uncool pants.  I like guys that don't give a fuck about fashion.  Makes them seem like they have better things to do, signifies a little lack of conformity.  KU looks like a batch of clones sometimes.  Anyhow, it's no thing now.  But how I used to pine for that guy!  I dreamed about him all the time.  The thing is, I could have had him, I think.  I saw the way he looked back at me, and I felt it.  I could have, but it was the longing that I liked, not the actual thing.    Before I came along, my man was dating someone else.  Living with her, even.  I call him a Love Child.  Since he emerged from the womb, he's been cosseted and fawned over and pinched on his soft cheeks.  I do it, too.  It's terrible.  He's had god knows how many lovers, lost his virginity at an age when I still thought boys had cooties.  Always dated older ladies, and it shows.   He knows what not to say and he can cope with all matters feminine.  He's a hell of a lot more savvy about that stuff than some of the older guys I've dated, guys who thought they'd get vaginas if they went into the goddamn MiniMart to pick up a box of tampons.  Sometimes I wonder about his past, but I don't particularly want to discuss mine, so I don't ask.  I have a bit of a history, actually.  Only 3 bona fide boyfriends, but between the ages of 17-18, and a little of 19:  Wow.  I was kind of wild.  Not as wild as some, but definitely wilder than most people would think.  (I look very wholesome and I dress like a librarian.)  Is that even relevent anymore?  I mean, by now it's like ancient history.  I heard this poem the other day, and it goes:  "It is important to keep old hat in secret closet."  I don't know who wrote it.  In any case, I am really bad at lying, so if it comes up, I will have no choice but to tell.  I am honest, but sometimes I think some things are better left alone.  Big expositions outlining every goddamn sinful thing are rarely anything but hurtful.    Whatever.  Now I get to go home and take a nice bath and call him, then probably stay up all damn night finishing a revision for tomorrow.  It's the last thing I have to turn in!  And then it's nothing but loving life after that.  I'm going to start counting the hours.

      Woke up covered in cuts again, but mystery solved!  My bed is like a nest--Twisted patchouli smelling blankets and books and papers and cracker crumbs and crayons...I clean it all the time, but I always end up sleeping narrowly on one side of the bed, hemmed in by a heap of random trash.  Somehow a stick pin got in the mix, so my legs and feet are cut to hell.  It gave me a weird dream:  A repetitive reel of a dream where I was getting up, talking to my roommate, getting dressed, going to campus to get tickets for the latest lecturer (Bill Clinton).... Then something bizarre would happen, and I would know it was a dream and that I needed to wake up, and it would start all over again.  At one point, my stomach was hanging open and I was trying to hold it shut with Band Aids.  And then I was in the woods with a highwayman who looked like Robert Smith from The Cure and we were having a nice time in the leaves, but then we had to find the Holy Grail...  Walked to school this morning listening to The Boss.  Big fat drops of rain were starting to dot the ground and the wind was making my ponytail flap around my head.  School's over but none of the work is.  I have to study and read and write...I have a feeling I am going to be spending some quality time alone with my imac.  I wish I cared about school more these days, but I don't.  I just want it to be over.  I want to lay in the grass and look at the sky.  I want to sleep and sleep until I am not tired any more.  I want to listen to rock and roll and drive around in my truck.  I want to take my man fishing and listen to the bugs sing.  Went out for beers last night with my roommate.  It'd been a long time since both of us have committed the sin of neglecting girlfriends in favor of other things.  I forget sometimes what a good girl she is, and how much fun it is just to talk.  I think we're going to be long time friends.  But there is a strange dynamic with her and my boyfriend, which kind of eats at me sometimes.  They're really good friends, and I wouldn't touch that, but one of them is lying to me, and I don't even want to know which one.  Who doesn't tell a white one now and again?  I'm as guilty as the next person, but it stinks being in the middle of it, hearing two versions of the same stories, sometimes even on the same night.  I'll just keep my mouth shut until it becomes relevent to my life.  It has crossed my mind that their hearts may be tied up in each other more than anybody knows.  Strange it doesn't bother me.  My man is really good to me.  Even if his heart is occupied by others, I think it's safe for me to believe that I am growing on him.  He's growing on me, for sure.  Neither of us are virgins.  There are the ever present ghosts.  Who cares?  There's still room for living ones.  So anyway, I won $200, not $250, but I got second place and I suppose that's something to be happy about.  The girl that took home the grand prize is absolutely amazing.  She's going to be famous one day, probably soon.  I think I will be too, but I have a lot farther to go.  My dad called last night, which was nice.  Sometimes I feel like he reaches for things to be proud of because I've fucked up so much.  I really have.  I should be at some prestigious graduate school right now, but I'm stuck in the mud in Kansas, in debt up to my ears and covered in scars.  Still paying for my past, I am.  Got a present in the mail from an old friend.  A fine bottle of whiskey with a commemorative tin cup.  (He knows what I like!)  I've known him since I was 15 and we used to be so tight.  He was a big nerd.  Wore black shoes and a rancid brown coat with duct tape on the sleeves.  Always smelled bad, always had thumbprints on his glasses.  I was slightly cooler than he was, mostly because I was cleaner and I had a reputation for being gay, which people thought was exotic.  The first time I saw him, I knew he was going to be my friend always.  Sure enough.  We don't talk much anymore, but when we do, we get down to it.  He's my Emergency Husband.  If we turn 37 and are yet unmarried, we're getting hitched.  I love him to death, but I really hope it doesn't come to that.  Christ, I've written a novel.

      The gods are loving Kansas today.  It's the best time of year:  Red moons, green grass, thunderstorms.  I dreamed about eggs last night, precipitated by this new agey short story I read before I conked out.    The story was about a lesbian who laid an egg out of her tear duct, and how it grew and grew, and she felt that it demanded something of her.  She tried eating it, taking care of it, climbing inside it.  Finally she just ended up carrying it around on her back.  The next story is called Sperm.  I am thinking this is some commentary on gender roles, but maybe I'm just too analytical.  But I digress.    The dream I had was that the egg in the story stood alone in this corral in my hometown that the 4-H kids used to use for displaying their prize pigs.  The egg just towered there, all pink an pulsating.  I was just leaning on the fence looking at it.  Then a seam slowly ripped in its crown and a flock of blue herons poured out of the top. Then a swarm of insect-like things that looked like dangling strips of undeveloped film.  They were like a plague of locusts coming to devour the world.  My dad appeared next to me and leaned on the fence.  He quoted some poetry that I do not recall and said that Yes, it was the End.  So I woke up all hot and disturbed and tossed the book into my closet.  When I went back to sleep, I dreamed of a smaller egg, one about the size of a basketball.  I was on some abandoned railroad tracks.  Weeds wound up through the gravel, and the railroad ties were all riddled with cracks.  There was a rickety black train with a count on it, like Count Dracula or Mephistophilis.  I played cards with him for a while, then I was back where I was, and I found the egg.  I pulled it a little ways from the trestle and set it on this old dilapidated wagon that sat in the dirt nearby.  My dad appeared again, and while we watched, the egg ripped open, and out flew a gangly gray bird with rainbows all over it.  My dad said, Hey, that's a pheonix.  And it was, and I suppose that means something, because the pheonix is a magical bird signifying rebirth and rising up from past strife.  So enough about dreams.  I went to the park and played frisbee with my man and our two friends last night.  Got on the swingset, too.  Felt so happy, but I have been here so long.  I thought of all the people I've been to the park with, how my first date my ex husband and I ever had was in the middle of the night on a bench there, and how my first boyfriend and I rolled around in the grass underneath the gazebo.  All the tracks I've made, all the days and loves that are no more.  But I felt good anyway, even though last night was one of many nights, and this love is one of many loves that will have played with my Grateful Dead frisbee and rolled laughing in the grass with me.  Rode around this morning, listening to the radio and singing.  Heard Imagine, and I thought I might cry.  This whole thing in Iraq, the state of the world.  The hooded victims, the greedy mongrels in charge of everything.   It's such a goddamn shame.  It's easy to get so tied up in my little life, and when I remember what's going on, it cuts deep.

      Dreamed my bloody head off this weekend.  My boy was at "drill."  Yes, he's in the military.  Luckily, he's a line cook, so I doubt if he will be shipped to Iraq to get his ass blown off.  But he does have to disappear from time to time to go dish out fried eggs and country ham.  So anyway, the dreaming.  Since I never sleep when he's around, I came home from work on Friday and slept for 17 hours straight.  I thought I was never going to wake up.  I had a nightmare about grass.  I was on the outskirts of my hometown at night, driving a broken El Camino the color of phlegm down some winding dirt road.  It died next to this ravine, and so I got out and I crawled through the grass.  The grass became thick, like hair, them it started pulling me toward the mouth of the ravine.  I couldn't move, I couldn't fight.  It ripped off my flip flops and wound around my wrists.  Then I was in the ravine, and all these vines and roots were piercing me and sucking away my blood.  I hung there, suspended, like a fly in a spider's web.    There was a lot of other stuff that night, but the other element that stands out the most is that Pancho Villa was there, and he was in a straightjacket.  The next day, I went camping and passed out with a ring of toasted marshmallow aroung my mouth and about a gallon of beer swishing around in my stomach.  I dreamed of my ex husband.  He approached me while I was walking on campus.  He was dressed like Johnny Cash, all black and Western.  Except he was wearing white canvas Converse shoes.  He handed me a book of poems.  He looked so old!  Last night was another gross managerie, but I don't recall all that much.  But I do have scratches all up and down my arms and on my feet, like I was ripping myself to shreds all night.  I dreamed I slit my wrist, and there were no veins in my arm, so the cut just hung open like a mouth.  I went to a restaurant in the boxcar of a train, and it was all tilted.  The menu was huge and I couldn't decide what to order.  I looked out the window, and there was this dark rainy parking lot, and a neon lit biker bar.  I saw my ex husband walking past.  We met eyes.  I ran away from the boxcar, down a hill, past a conglomoration of places I have lived--past frat houses, fountains, skyscrapers, playgrounds.      I have a feeling I am going to see him again.  I am really scared, because even though he's a cruel man and I know better, he has a grip on me like nobody else.  He will be home this summer, living with his mom.  And I will be here, a townie for life!  Last year around this time was the last time we hung out together.  He told me he loved me, then like a total pushover, I cried and slept with him.  Not my finest hour, but instead of continuing to berate myself for it, let me just say I loved him like nobody's business, and that was a hard time.

      In the comp lab yet again.  I have yet to break down and lose the godforsaken bet I made regarding the internet, but it seems that my opponent is as stubborn as I am.  Which means I may be without it at work until the end of my days there.  Which will be this December, I hope.  Will begin teaching then, which scares me to death and makes me feel pleasantly adult at the same time.  So...I am just waiting for my man to call me.  He's back in lovely Kansas today, but won't be with me until tomorrow.  I feel so giddy and immature at the prospect of seeing him again.  In class today I tallied up the remaining hours of his absence.  Pathetic!  Whatever happened to being cool and nonchalant?  I think I should take a page from Jane Eyre's book and try to be more callous, at least to his face.  I am so gooey that I fear he will stop taking me seriously.  Is that true about men, that you always have to keep them guessing, just to pique their interest?  But he is a different sort of guy.    I don't know.  It's all a goddamn mystery to me.    So work stinks.  I forgot my coffee thermos, so I got this terrible headache.  Feels like a vise around my skull.  I have a shamelessly addictive personality type.  I find that I am easily addicted to routines, places, drinks, smokes, the computer, and all manner of hedonistic habits.  If only I could become addicted to exercise and stalks of celery, Wow.  Watch out.    I can't seem to get anything done.  Writing has not been inspiring, and reading my assigned books has been about all I can do in the name of scholarly activity.  I feel compelled to read nineteenth century romances and cry at the touching parts.  Oh, Mister Rochester!  Oh Jane!  Let me at least think of one worthwhile thing to note on my Blurty, some memory or feeling or revelation:  Honestly, nothing soulful today.  Just me and my frivolous use of my limited time, and not so repentant about it, either.

      What will I find when he comes home?  These days have stretched out so long.  Laffy Taffy days, minutes like hours--in spite of how busy I've been.  Two weeks is a long time if you've only been dating for twelve or so.  Feels like he's been sent to Siberia.    So I've had a hell of a weekend, but I couldn't really say much about it.  I drank copiously and immersed myself in politics.  Fahrenheit 9/11, Distorted Morality (Noam Chomsky), lots and lots of news.  I am feeling the glut of it all, the resulting guilt for being complacent.  And of course the knowledge that my complacence probably has no more effect than any of the proactive things I have done in my life to stop the tide.  Conversations with friends have become forums and debates.  My father and I, both deeply immersed in early American governmental ideology and documents, took breakfast over Hemingway and war.  What can I do?  All I do is become more and more aware, more thoroughly educated.  And though it shakes the foundations of my little universe, the sun rises and sets as usual.  It's raining today.  I have been asked to go to Santa Cruz and I am tempted.  In spite of my outrage I am going to go home and read Jane Eyre again and eat some cheese.

      Last night I heard Concrete Blonde at the bar and I missed my man so badly.    I went to my Monday night hangout where the bartender knows my face and the beer flows cheap.  A predictable jukebox, crooked pool tables, good times.  When I was seventeen, the summer right before I ran away from home, my parents went to Europe and left me unattended.  The best summer ever...I worked part part time at a pretzel stand in the mall and did theater productions.  My friends and I were midnight children.  Like all the rest are, I suppose, but it seemed special anyway.  We broke into apartment complex swimming pools and swam  in our underwear.  We jumped off of out buildings, bombing straight into the dark water.  We tackled each other and showed each other our bare asses.  The cops would come, and we would squeeze up to the edge and breathe softly while the flashlight beam swept over our heads and paused on our telltale soggy footprints.  We got caught sometimes, ushered out of the pool and lectured.  Half the fun of that age was the risk of being caught, the element of misbehavior.  Other nights we tripped acid and drove around the vacant streets, cruising just so far up the highway past the Donut Shoppe and the liquor store with the Vend-a-Bait out front, pretending we might go somewhere.  There were nights of spiced rum and games of Truth or Dare.  There were older men and there were bored hot days.  There was the pizza joint with its sad sagging slices and overloaded ashtrays.  There were nights we drove up to the high point of the town where MANHATTAN is spelled out in big concrete letters.  Used rubbers, cigarette butts, graffiti.  The sparse city lights- The cemetary, the lady in white with her cupped hands, the Fortune tomb- Pleasant Valley, Pilsbury Crossing- Hopkins Creek Road-  I have a really vivid memory.  Sometimes it just makes me feel old, letting all this stuff come to mind.  But enough of that.  A reminder to self:  Sometimes the horoscope is right.  It's fiction, but it's strangely worth heeding at times.  I need to stop being silly and chase these fancies away.  Oh, and my friend got me a ticket to The Pixies for my birthday!  Gigantic.

      Saturday I rode a motorcycle, my hair flying back behind me and the wind beating my face.  At first I screwed my eyes shut and clung hard to my friend, but then I said to myself, Well, death is never far, so why not enjoy this?  We got up to 114 mph.  I let go of him and relaxed into the turns.  I looked up at the crescent moon.  Me in my tatty blue sweater from Goodwill, washed nearly white.  No socks beneath my tennis shoes, no makeup.  Something about flying down the road on a motorcycle made me feel beautiful.  Last night I played kickball.  Slammed a beer and wandered out onto the field.  Something about it made me feel like I was in junior high gym class again.  We lost, badly, but that's fine.  I gave my boss a ride to and fro.  What an interesting man.    Today in class we discussed the concept of Natural Rights outlined by John Locke.  Life, liberty, property.  I am so sick of undergraduate classes, so sick of this place and this tiresome routine.  I had to fight the urge to stand up on my desk and do an air guitar and sing You got to FIGHT for your RIGHT to PARty!!!  at the top of my voice.  My roommate's back home, full of stories and just about wrecked in love with the Kenyan man she met.  (Unwilling to admit this, of course, but it's obvious.)  It's clear she fell in love with the place, the life, the way over there.  And now back in Kansas, this stagnant pool in which I have become a fixture.  Our talk this morning made me itch to go somewhere--Anywhere.  I need to have an adventure.    I keep fantasizing about getting up from this bloody computer monitor and walking up to the toll booth where the road forks East and West on the interstate.  Get a cardboard sign and a change of socks...  Or maybe I should just keep on working and make sure I can go somewhere legally and paid for.  Peace Corps, study abroad, shoestring vacation...At this point I'd be happy going to the lake and jigging for crappie.  Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of  Happiness.  I have to fight for that.

      Well, I'm at my folk's house...Again.  It's both convenient and terrible to live as close as I do to my hometown.  It's less than 90 miles away, and I've been here twice in two weeks fucking around with a loan my dad's co-signing for me.  He's off playing poker, and I've been on the computer so long I'm about to go blind.  Had kind of a strange night, followed by a pretty intense morning.  I had a visitor.  We went to my girlfriend's place and drank red wine and played Scrabble and listened to a record she made with her boyfriend.  I wore her purple feather boa and smoked white cigarettes in a Marilyn Monroe sort of way.  She brings out the silly girly side of me.    Had this really soul searching conversation with my friend who stayed over at my apartment last night.  Which was a little odd because we were at this breakfast place where most people just sip coffee and talk about sports.  All of the sudden it kind of dawned on me...I think he might still be a little besotted, which means 1) He is not a fruit.  2)  It will be hard to be friends.  Which really makes me sad.    Now I'm going to visit an old time friend, one who has also had issues with liking me the wrong way.  I'm not some great beauty, nor do I have a particularly magnetic personality.  I have come to the conclusion that friendships between men and women are always complicated, as much as it's possible to ignore it.  No exceptions.  But I guess everything else, i.e. common interests and interesting conversations, and the vital objective POV of a 'just friend' can trump crushy feelings.    Other than that--It's been a cool sunny day, and mushrooms are dotting the ground, and I ate a waffle for breakfast, and I burned some cd's for my sweetheart, and now I am going to go drink some nice cold beers with my friend and talk about politics.  And then I am going to drive on home and write a story.  Life is good, even if some things about it are kind of complicated.

      So he's probably freezing his ass off on that military plane right now.  I will paint one fingernail each day--Will have done them all by the time he returns.  I am such a child in ways.  I look awfully funny with only one red one.  Had a good night.  After my slinkster cool breakdancer friend went home, I stripped down to underwear and talked on the phone for a couple of hours.  Something made me decide to just cut the crap and tell my man the Big Bad Secret.  I realized that there is a turning point in relationships, and thereafter, it's hard to introduce new and threatening information.  So even though I was sitting on my couch drinking a coke, I felt like I was standing on the edge of a precipice, looking for the courage to jump.  He was very understanding.  I feel lighter now, freed from the burden of living a public fiction.  At least with him.    Woke this morning covered in scratches again.  Dreams featuring dimly lit French restaurants mingled with tatty beer stained bowling alleys and highschool classrooms and cookie cutter suburban houses.  I dreamed I went to Jill's house, the imaginary lady I dreamed of the other night.  She had two teenaged daughters, but they were gone.  I tried on their wigs.  One was just your typical short and styled Afro.  The other was Las Vegas, all pretty braids and colored feathers.  When I put the plain one on, I became black while I looked in the mirror, but I still mostly had the same features.  Jill was like, Oh, no, this won't do.  Then we went to some grease pot burger joint and had dinner.  My roommate comes home soon.  She's back safely from Africa.  I hear through the grapevine she met someone over there, a cosmic Kenyan man who rocked her world and lit up her intellect.  I am glad she met someone, because she's been so duty bound and it's made her get old too soon.  Me, I'm just feeling really entrenched in Kansas because two pillars of my social life get to go off on these fabulous adventures.      I spent her first night away taking pipes with her boyfriend, which I know is bad form.  Somehow she's convinced that he has a marijuana addiction, which is a terrible misconception.  Obviously he gets high way too much, but that's more of a symptom of some other problem, i.e. an inability to cope with the world without a buffer or just an overdose of hedonism compounded by a substantial trust fund.  So anyway, I officially contributed to his decline, and although I don't put much stock in that idea, I was definitely being thoughtless at the time.  But now I wonder if that will even matter.  I hope not, because I am very curious about her trip, and I want to hear about it in graphic detail.  I have a vested interest in Africa, which came about in a weird way.  I was doing the typical Spanish 101 thing my freshman year, then I met my husband and forgot I was enrolled in college.  So I bombed everything, forgot my verb tenses, and ended up convinced that I was going to join the Peace Corps with this man, who was at the time an Anthropology major, learning Swahili as part of his recommended course work.  I took it up next time the opportunity came about.  That's where I met my dearest roommate (an African Studies major) and the most influential teacher of my life, Mwalimu.  (Mwalimu is not her name, just a respectful way of addressing a teacher in Swahili.)  Anyway, I took her for three years, and the last year, I was the only student in the upper level section.  The ex switched his major to mine, trusty old Creative Writing, and blew off the class, only recalling one-liners to impress the ladies at the bar.  But I liked it, so I kept at it, and now I am just about fluent in Swahili, of all things.  And I know a hatful of things about Africa and its people.  And my man, well, I met him through my roommate.  (So thank you, oh ex of mine, for encouraging me to follow you to the "Dark Continent," because I'm really happy now.)  Isn't that goddamn crazy, how life plays out?    I am still going to join the Peace Corps when I finish my Masters, and I will surely be stationed in Kenya or Tanzania.    So I have written too much, but I'm on telephone duty at work, and I can't bear the boredom of it.  Must do a crossword.

      My man and I talked about going to Brazil a few days past.  Is this the curse of young lovers, that they always want to snatch up life, to wildly fling themselves into adventures?  To be honest, we are kind of lazy.  We both appreciate pants with elastic and sleeping until the afternoon.  So often life is anti-climactic but comfortable, with more excitement taking place in thoughts and conversations than in my mundane existence.  But we talked about going to Brazil, driving there, and that is a dream I will cling to.  Haven't I concocted similar schemes with every close friend and lover?  My friends I moved here with wanted to caravan to San Francisco in a beat up van named Annemarie.  My first boyfriend and I were empty as pockets, thank god, because if we could have paid gas, we, too, would have landed somewhere below the equator.  My only cirteria was that we had to be somewhere where oranges could be picked right off the tree.  My husband and I almost jumped a train on several occasions.  We talked about how the "world" seemed like the killing grounds of love.  (What a crock.)  And then my good time friend, over every glass of bad blush wine we share, tells me that one day we will move to Spain to become waitresses and live like The Sun Also Rises.    These are not the sixties, and I can't hitchhike across the desert like my dad did.  I can't roll into New Orleans and sleep on a feather tick mattress in the trunk of my car.  This is not the Jack Kerouac generation, and I'd get ruined for sure if I tried to make it to the coast on the back of a produce truck.  But in spite of this modern age, with its celly-phones and guns and mass media inspired mistrust, I'm going to have an adventure.  One of these days, when I realize that I have nothing much to lose and a world of stories to gain...I will hit the ground running.  He's leaving today, going down South.  He thought I was upset about it, but more than anything, I just wish I were going somewhere, too.  Which is irrational.  Military deployment is nothing to get jealous about.  I will miss him something terrible, but already my list of obligations has grown so that I'll be busy enough not to feel it too much.  Last night we went downtown and he got a little lit up.  I gave him a piggy back ride.  We went to a nice Irish pup and made fools of ourselves for a bit, then we walked to the park that's been the scene of many a nighttime drama.  But it was smooth and easy, and we laughed at jokes I no longer remember and climbed a tree.  I think he knows how hard I feel for him, which is very good, as dangerous as it might be.  I found myself telling him all sorts of deep dark secrets, but I couldn't bring myself to tell him everything.  Just a vague outline of a rather torrid past.  I can't help but keep one card in particular close to my chest.  Something hardwired in me, the self preservation instinct, makes me withhold it.  But I suppose it will never matter one way or the other if he knows or not--At times, I am able to forget it happened at all.  But sometimes I feel guilt bearing down, and a shadow of the life I could be leading right now passes over me.  I could say I feel bad, but honestly, I end up thanking my lucky goddamn stars for the life I'm living instead.

      Last night lurid dreams of Africa, deep in the jungle in a third world shack.  Highschool friends working in grocery stores, photographic negatives of swamps with footprints drowned in blood.  Faces of wolves with cataract eyes, a red so deep it was almost black.    I was tired, so tired that I could hardly make sense anymore.  I tried to take a nap after work.  My man and I went back to the air conditioned cavern of his apartment and tried to sleep.  My eyes wouldn't keep shut, and though I needed it badly, sleep wouldn't come.  I get turrets when I'm tired.  All the weird maggots squirming in my brain come out onto the surface.  I thought I was going to cry over nothing.  I felt like a child.  My weaknesses came into the light, too.  Insecurities and old hurts and jokes that aren't funny anymore.  I had to leave just to hide.  Today is the last day before he leaves.  He's going to Florida for two weeks, some military thing.  I hear from my roommate that he's cheated on girlfriends on these expeditions.  Men take off their wedding rings and go to strip clubs, have one-night stands and strange encounters:  Anything goes.  But I trust he won't do me like that.  Mostly I will just be missing him, hoping he is okay down there.  In the jungle.  He is so good to me.  He brought me peas yesterday, surely the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.  Better than roses, those peas.     I will have several days alone, which I think will be good.  I think part of the weirdness yesterday was that I have not been writing regularly except on this thing.

      Christ what a long night!  I slept for a few short hours and now I am at work, sort of propped up in my chair so I don't do a faceplant into the computer monitor.  Stayed up all hours with my man last night, talked a lot about the past and revealed some things.  I love the night, but the sun came up and the birds started singing, and life must go on, as much as I would love to be in bed right now...  Today is kind of abrasive to me.  New Student Orientation.  Lots of Texans in big shiny cars driving down the center of the road.  Stopping.  Pointing.  Stopping...Driving the wrong way down one ways...I usually don't get irritated with people and their foolish ways, but today is an exception.   I went across campus to pick up a video tape and I almost died three times.  Saturday I went back home.  My dad's a bachelor while my stepmom's at a conference.  We talked about a lot of unusual things.  Our conversations usually have a pattern.  We discuss my future as an academic, in which I am encouraged to do all sorts of things to bolster my resume.  That leads to literature, and that leads to politics, and how abysmally stupid our current administration is, and how academia has become a business more than a learning environment.  And so on.  But this time, we talked about Cartesian dualism, and he told me that he'd been visited by my mother's departing spirit as she lay dying in a wing of St. Mary's Hospital in Manhattan, Kansas.  And he said that he was a spiritual man, and that the closest thing to a creed he has is Whitman's "Leaves of Grass."  It's funny, we never discussed these things, and I have often said that "Leaves..." is the written word, insofar as there is anything sacred to me.  Here is a burning question:  How in the hell I am going to pay for school this summer?  Where is nine hundred dollars supposed to come from?  Out of a goddamn hat?  I am not eligible for loans until next semester, and my parents are broke.  I am also broke, but even if I weren't, I have *never* been up nine hundred dollars!  I hurt myself playing kickball yesterday.  I'm in a league with some folks I work with and some others I don't know.  It's a lot of fun, albeit kind of silly.  Our uniform is a nuclear accident green t-shirt and black shorts.  We lose, but we scream and drink celebratory beers anyway.  So I sauntered up to the plate and watched the ball roll toward me, took a running kick at it, then ripped something important.  I feel like a cripple, but I am too embarrassed about the way I got the injury to make a deal out of it.  But wow!  It goddamn hurts!  Also saw Harry Potter, which I loved better than the previous ones.  Much darker, but that's the tone of the book.  Obviously I need to see it again.  It's also the ten year anniversary for Pulp Fiction, which I watched last night.  A classic.    I picked up Passage by Connie Willis.  Good summer reading, and it's about death, which I consider a merit.  Why is death obsessing me these days?  I'm not even feeling morbid, just uncharacteristically interested in what constitutes life and what happens afterwards.  And of course the concept of the spirit, and is it a separate thing?  I have spent the last year and a half rebounding from a Christian man and spitting out all the absurd things he tried to press down my throat.  I have been operating under a strictly biological view of the cosmos.  But now I am wondering if perhaps biology extends into realms that I have given up on considering.  I have been thinking also about the mimosa tree that used to grow behind the little shoebox of an apartment where I lived after the separation.  How vivid pink the flowers were when spring first came, how the blooms showed through the four windows that I looked through evey morning, when I used to wake up with that gaping hole in my chest.  How the hummingbirds used to congregate there, sucking on the nectar.  What to make of all these strange echoes of memories and weird overtones?

      Things I have accomplished at work today:          1.  Picked nail polish off of the fingers on my left hand, thus improving my      overall work appearance.     2.  Filled in my on-line journal and checked my e-mail compulsively for two      hours, successfully honing my computer skills for future use in work      related projects.     3.  Shared stories of bar fights with coworkers, embellishing the ass-kicking      I gave a girl at Stu's Midtown Tavern to literary proportions.  Which I believe      heightened overall morale.     4.  Deepened ass print in the swivel chair reserved for student workers, thereby      creating a more welcoming work environment for future employees.     5.  Took a break and talked to boyfriend on phone while smoking a skinny white      cigarette, which I really deserved because I have been way too focused on work      today.  I can't believe I only make $7 an hour.

      I feel like a goddamn slacker today.  Slept straight through class, but it felt so good to lay in bed with the fan blowing on me.  Met my man's father today.  Wish I had been a little more with it--I still had eye boogers and I hadn't had my morning coffee.  We went to some steak place with giant slabs of meat and rolls as big as softballs.  His dad's running for state rep now, which I find more than a little amusing.  I kind of called that one.  He was so into his son doing it that I could see he wanted to have his fingers in it.  I was afraid he would be weird about me because I am a little older, definitely not conservative, and definitely not East Indian.  I think these worries were unwarranted.  I'm pretty sure it went okay, but I still need to find a cup of coffee somewhere.  Anyhow, to hell with Kansas today.  It feels like an armpit outside.  The sky's all gray.  I feel awesome, though, probably more than I deserve.  I stayed up all night reading Bellwether by Connie Willis.  Such a good book!  It always reinforces my values a little bit, and it also pokes a lot of fun at cool people, which is very gratifying for a nerd like me.  I remember that one of the better ways to be an activist is to live what I believe in and hope it catches on.  Recycling, remembering to tip, patronizing the library, being friendly, voting, not littering...These little things really make a difference.  I often feel like I'm totally powerless against this tidal wave of bad politics, war, environmental waste...But I can take control of my own actions, and hey, that's a good start.  Last night I dreamed about my first boyfriend.  He was a big-footed, long-haired country boy who played role playing games and wore a shirt with a Superman insignia on it.  He lived with his mom in a trailer home on a wild patch of land on the outskirts of town.  The whole thing was done in sunflowers.  Man, it was crazy.  She had her crocheted sunflowers, her clear plastic sunflowers, her sunflower afghans, candles, cups, flip flops, coasters, cookies jars, curtains...None of them really matched.  (My roommate calls this "conspicuous consumption, and she says it affects the poor and uneducated.)  It was like some surreal garden in there, and everyone of those flowers was a little dingy, asphyxiated from the long white cigarettes she used to smoke.    My boyfriend's room was the only sunflower-free area.  He had Heavy Metal posters and plaster of paris dragons and swords and comic books and Star Wars toys.  He probably still does--All he ever talked about was how great it was to be a kid.  He was a really really big kid.  I guess he never crosses my mind anymore, but he was my first genuine boyfriend.  We dated for almost two years.  I wonder how he's doing, but I know I won't bother finding out.  I dreamed we were  in this pretty sunlit room getting cozy together on a blanket of many colored yarns.    So I am broke again.  Broke broke broke.  I have been a spending fool.  I've had so many gifts to get.  Wedding gifts, birthday gifts, graduation gifts.  Plus the usual bills and crap.  And of course whenever I go to the store to pick up a bottle of detergent, I walk out of there with a basket of plastic hair clips, fruit scented shampoos, sugar free chocolates, and cute panties.  I am a big sucker.  The musak goes to my head and I forget I can't even pay my tuition.  I need to visit Billy Talen's Church of Stop Shopping.  Add that to my sizable list of self improvements.

      I'm feeling about as exciting as dirt this morning.  Somehow this bad ass cold is still hanging around.  Perhaps I should leave off smoking?   I dreamed about my good friend who recently eloped with her boyfriend.  I've always had a weird thing for her boyfriend, which I think could be mutual?  It's very bad, but it's only physical, so we avoid each other like the plague.  When we have to talk we are so polite it hurts.     Anyway, they owned this head shop in a little dustblown town.  They sold things like bundles of sage and beads made out of glass and t shirts that looked like burlap bags.  I was supposed to do some work for them, designing a logo and whatnot.  My friend said her special symbol was a four leaf clover.  Then I was in the mountains with a bunch of children that were supposed to be my brothers and sisters.  We camped in a caravan next to a river with white rapids and deep red banks.  I had to bicycle from our camp into the tourist town nearby to work as a waitress for a guy who looked like Adolf Hitler in a restaurant with a 50's theme.  I actually went home last night, for the first time in several days.  Almost without realizing it, I have pretty much been spending all my time at my man's house.  So I made a point of going home last night.  I slept like the dead.  This morning was good, even though I'm still feeling like hell.  I went for a walk in the rain and got a newspaper, ate breakfast, drank coffee.    Everything's going great with him.  These past few months have been dandelion wine.  I just need to remember to keep up my writing and stay in touch with my friends.  It never seems important to do that stuff, but then it is.

      Decided to call in well from work yesterday, then proceeded to have a classic summer day.  Slept till 2 p.m. and then went swimming.  It was beautiful.  Dreamed the other night that I went fishing in this runoff ditch under an overpass.  The water was sick and black with purple lights in it.  I was bobber fishing from a raft made out of a tire.  Trash floated by--shoes, oil cans, used rubbers.  There was a Roman bath with pillars on one end, and a levee with a dilapidated dock on the other.  Old fisherman drinking coffee from a Thermos sat on the dock.  Punk rock boys hung off the marble staircase of the bath.  I drifted to and fro, then I was eaten by a diseased orange catfish the size of a man.  (4:20) Saw a strange crimson moon while out driving in the fields near the lake.  My old country cruising grounds.  How full of memories those roads are!  I remember how I used to ride next to my husband with my head on his shoulder and our fingers laced.  Back when it was good.  Sunsets so pretty they about killed me to see them, then.   And that summer of torrential rains, catfishing in the dark in our matching overalls, muddy and smiling.  I also remember driving those roads alone, sick with grief, wanting so bad just to keep on driving so I wouldn't have to go home to him.  Sleeping out at Lonestar Lake with my Taj Mahal and my chardonnay.  How ironic, Lonely Star.  Part of the reason I wanted to leave this place is that it's pregnant with memories.  I have worn it out like an old shoe, and traces of the past cling to it.  I hope these next couple of years cover up the worst and replace the bad with goodness.  The crimson moon bodes well.  The last two nights have been insomnia nights, which are frustrated and exhausting.  My mind just turns over and over on itself, a broken record.  I finally took a sleeping pill last night.  I hallucinated briefly before conking out like I'd been hit on the head with a mallet.  My man decided to stick around and not run for state rep, which is a great deal on all counts.  It's not just that he'll be here, finishing college and of course hanging out a lot with me.  It's also the heightened respect I have for him now that he's decided to stand up to his dad.   Not that I didn't respect him already, but I feel like staying and finishing school was the adult choice.    So I was thinking of asking him to move in with me, but I keep stopping myself.  I remember how quickly I got domestic with my husband, and there's really a lot of charm in waiting.  I enjoy having my own space and I like the concept of dating instead of living together.  What's the hurry?  Sometimes a tight budget and other extraneous factors can encourage a couple move too fast.  So I have resisted the impulse.  I think this is a good thing.  I have to at least seem aloof.  (I need to practice that.)  I think I am getting better at learning from my mistakes.    I think.

      Memorial Day weekend will always be a fishing weekend, as little as I go fishing anymore.  My husband always made the yearly pilgrimage to the river with his muddy cooler and his Busch Lite.  The tradition stuck fast with me, although I spent this weekend at home.  Two years ago:  Twenty-one in overalls, sleeping face down in the grass.  The river was swollen from lots of rain.  Oil cans and coolers and tires and whole dead trees floated idly by while we fished.  We caught nothing.  I had a burning crush on my husband's friend who was with us.  He was a mean man, but he was tall and he had dark brown eyes.  I have been a victim of dark brown eyes.  I didn't dare breathe a word of my affection, but he found his way into my dreams.  I showed my adoration by allowing him to sit shotgun while I inhabited the back seat with the squalid sack of dead minnows we brought along for bait.  I slept uncovered in the dirt, with spiders leaning over me on stalks of grass and ashes blowing from the fire.  I slept on the ground because I am a country girl of good peasant stock, because I've been camping all my life.  I thought it proved my worth to the men, who were accustomed to finicky permed kind of girls.  But now I realize that it did nothing but make me look like a submissive dog, asleep at her master's feet.  My friend came to see me this weekend, a friend I dated briefly after the divorce.  We went to Lonestar Lake and drank whiskey on the dock.  We had a nice talk, and we'd just passed the formalities and started to get down to the real things, then a hoard of teenagers roared up in a truck and ran screaming into the water.  Then a handful of overweight fisherman came and sat right beside us.  They were cool, but we wanted to be alone, so we went back to my place and played cards.  I won, so he drank.  He's kind of artistocratic and flimsy, allergic to everything and prone to seizures--definitely not of the same stout composition as me.  He threw up from the whiskey and passed out on my couch.  He's a good guy, and I think we will be friends for a long time.  Without the civilizing influence of my roommate, I have devolved into a bachelor-like existence.  Dishes in the sink, art projects littering the floor, laundry hanging from every doorknob.  As much as I dig living alone, I miss her.  It's like she's my husband or something.  She's in Africa now, sleeping in missionary quarters.  She will soon be swabbing AIDS patients and building chicken coops with her church group.  No memorial for Memorial Day.  Just housework and cigarettes and errands.  Last night I slept in the arms of my man, who returned from Texas at midnight.  We stayed up until we heard the morning birds calling in the trees.  I dreamed B grade horror movie kind of dreams, running from zombies and digging deep in the ruined earth.  And now I'm at work--Tired!  I am in love.  Here is something I have been meaning to write for awhile just to remind myself:  It is possible that I take too much for granted, I am too self assured, and I am eager to trust what I hear when I hear what I want to.  I might be the one to fall.  While I am in the self-administered advice-giving mode:  I decided to give drinking a rest as of Sunday morning.  I consider myself a social drinker, nothing more.  But lord did I crave a drink yesterday.  I need to clean up my act.  I'll be getting old fast if I keep hurting myself like I do.

      Saw a nasty reminder from the past yesterday at a filling station a few blocks from my apartment:  The boy who ruined me when I was a freshman in highschool.  I suppose he wasn't much older than I was, and he was just a misguided youth in a shitpot of a Kansas town, but I can't help feeling sick when I see him.  He knew me, for sure.  I guess he would.  I neglected to mention this to my man, which was cunning in a bad way.  I just didn't want to bring it up.  I didn't want him to storm back into the gas station and knock that guy upside his head.  I didn't want to explain what happened and how.  It's been a good eight years, and it doesn't matter anymore.  And even though the sight of him makes me sick, I feel like he's written his own ticket and he can go for the ride alone, without a push from me.  I hope he feels like an asshole.  So anyway, it was dark, and I 've been sick anyway so I was all strung out on cough medicine, so it was easy enough to play it off.  The rest of the night was good, but I kept getting visited by memories that made me cringe and it was hard to pay attention to the moment.    But life is still good.  I just can't wait to stop being so ill because there are a million things I want to do.  My man's running for State Representative, on the Republican ticket, of course.  (Once again I must ask myself how I happened to get here.)  Anyway, he doesn't want to do it and it's a bad move altogether, but his dad's pressuring him.  Pressuring with good intentions, of course, but it still has all the negative effects of any run-of-the-mill manipulation.  His family's probably the most important element of his life, and I can tell he's going to do his dad's bidding no matter how much he feels like it's a mistake.  I am trying to be supportive and not say what I think, which is, Let your dad run for office himself if he's so into it and finish your goddamn degree!  So far, so good in that department.  I don't want to have a say in it one way or the other because that's just bad form for a new girlfriend.  Anyway, I might be free again come August.     I don't mind being free, but it's so easy to get used to having someone.

      Sometimes I wonder if I made a huge mistake getting involved with someone.  As the butterflies have started to fly off, I realize that there are some huge divides between us.  It goes beyond the cute liberal/conservative dichotomy.  It gets into emotional territory that seems dangerously familiar.  I think I might get hurt badly, and I want to steel myself against it without undermining our relationship by being too guarded.  What I really mean to say is that he's not as crazy about me as he seemed at first.  Politely, he's still heartbroken from his last girlfriend.  He still loves her a lot.  I have my own closet, chock full of old hats and musty secrets and burnt feelings.  But to hear about this "cosmic" love, to know it's on his mind, that cuts me to ribbons.  Why is everyone I meet in recovery and heartbroken over someone?  I really wanted to be the only one on his mind.    Jealousy is such a beast.

      I have been using Blurty.com for my outlet, but I cam across this site, and it has a much more mature feel to it.  Seems like every other post in Blurty is by a fifteen year old anorexic who wants to die.  I'm not the most mature person in the world, but that offended my sensibilities.    I hope to keep this one more of a secret.  The last one was discovered by a co-worker and my boyfriend.  These things can be such a liability, and I have found myself censoring my entries to preserve the peace.  Enough of that!  I will begin transferring my Blurty entries to this site for continuity's sake.  Just a note:  I am doing this on the clock.  I am a state employee.  Tax dollars at work.

      Mushroom weather, dank and hot.    Saw a friend from my fiction class yesterday.  I have been pretty awful about standing her up and not returning her calls.  I just get so busy, so sleep-deprived, so involved with my limited social circle...It's taken a conscious effort to make new friends.  I have a real bond with this lady.  She's nearly ten years my senior, and she has an eleven year old daughter, and she doesn't look like someone you'd think I'd be friends with.  But she's positively awesome.  She doesn't care about things that don't matter.  I mean, she honestly doesn't.  She cares so little for fashion--I have never once seen her in something without elastic, something that didn't get haphazardly pulled out of a laundry basket and yanked over her body for the sole utilitarian purpose of covering herself.  Lots of people, myself included "don't care," but we all pore over the mirror and putz around wondering if our pants reveal how overweight we really are.  Her attitude on these matters has earned my complete respect.  She seems very interested in exploring creative avenues, and although I haven't read anything she's written that's been really great, I like engaging with someone who renews my interest in something that has become almost a chore for me.  She told me she had a daughter who died of SIDS.  I told her about the divorce.  Forging friendships is always like that, building trust on those hidden things.  I hope I am not so stupid as to put her to the side just because she's older and cannot stay out late drinking.  That would be my loss.  So let me risk dooming myself by writing here that I will not be such a crappy friend, and that I will try not to be so lazy about my social life.  (written Sunday afternoon)  I am really wanting to become a cop today.  Maybe Monday I will find out how.  Surprise everyone.  I need to do something different.  I love the shelter of academia, but I don't care enough right now, and I think I'd be wasting everyone's time.  It'd be easy enough to come back to KU or the like when I am ready, maybe?  Research is in order.  And cleaning out so I can pass the U/A.  (Not the best way to get the job, peeing green!)  My dad will not speak to me for quite some time.  He will secretly suspect that this decision has some oblique connection to dating a Republican.  Why do I want to be a cop?  I know well that I will be very bored most of the time.  But I feel like I am good in danger, and I am kind of a soft and nice person, and I want to do some public service with my life.  Not to mention that I will make much much much more money than I would ever make as a teacher.  Then again, teaching is pretty much a labor of love as well.  I will sleep on it, but I think, like the Underground Man, I will do what I least expect to do, driven by desires I cannot even name.  My baby and I have reached a new level of intimacy.  Last night, my new nose piercing came out and we had to spend an hour in the bathroom with a pair of pliers and a sewing needle.  That was pretty sobering, to be honest.  I wonder if he will be so good in a few months, if he will soon be tired enough of my ways and become laissez faire.  I am constantly amazed at the lengths that man will go to just to make my life more pleasant.  One of the first things I ever told him at the onset of our relationship was, I only hope you are always happy to see me.  And to this day, that's the only criteria I have for Us, that it never seem like a chore, that it's always sincere, even when we calm down a bit.  One more thing:  For christssake, I need to give drinking a rest!  All weekend I sat on my stoop with a beer in my hand and a cigarette dangling from my mouth.  The only homework I did was reading the wrong book.  Why am I so All or Nothing?

      How did I get here?          This is not my beautiful house!  This is not my beautiful wife!  (Letting the days go by, water flowing underground)  God some mornings I wake up and I feel like I have been asleep for the last two years.  I wake up now and still I expect to see a man long gone sleeping next to me.  I wake and I expect to find myself at the last place I considered home, a place that was no more mine than this public lab I am sitting in.  I get so disoriented, like my life has splintered off into unrelated fragments, like this is some kind of ruse and all of the sudden he will rush in laughing at my horrified expression and give me a handful of dandelions and we will ride off in the maroon station wagon with the Gar Angler Association sticker on the back and the fast food trash on the floor.  And then all this will make sense somehow.  Needless to say, I am in a strange mood today.  I must have dreamed old dreams last night to wake up so frenzied and wondering what the hell happened.  I would not trade this life I am living.  I would not forfeit myself and rearrange the past.  If it took all that trouble to bring me to this moment, to bring me up to the present with my new lover and my good friends and my fancy free life--I would do it all over again.  I remember my first job back here after my brief stint in Iowa City working for the Man.  It was summertime, that infamous summer of highs in the 110's.  I walked to an Amoco a few blocks away from my apartment.  The pay was low, a dime over minumum wage.  It smelled like sun scorched concrete and motor oil.  There was trash eddying around the pumps, and the boss had a buzzcut and he looked at my boobs the whole time I filled out the application.  As I walked back home, I knew that something was going to come of me taking that job.  I prayed to thin air that something big would happen, Big Love.  I wanted with all my heart for something to break me, just so I could feel something.  The Prince came rolling up in an AMC Eagle, one of many such Princes.  One had a boa constrictor.  One was tall.  One brought me roses when I had my wisdom teeth removed.  One smoked GPC full flavors and read USA Today.  One turned out to be married.  One wore a kerchief on his head and painted my picture.  But it was the roaring of the AMC Eagle I looked forward to, the sound of its muffler dragging on the ground, sparks flying everywhere.  Sometimes I think I was so tired of my life that it could have been anyone, but in truth, it probably had to be him.  I don't love him anymore.  I don't even hate him.  Most of the time, he's just a footnote to stories I tell from those years.  But sometimes that life I signed up for, the life I fully expected to follow through with--It comes washing over me at night while I sleep, and I wake up like I did this morning, saying his name.  Enough about that.  I went to the lake yesterday with my roommate and her (ex) boyfriend.  It was a sunkissed day.  There were trucks painted in camo with rotweillers tied to the bumpers.  There was loud AC/DC, there were hoards of sunburned blonde headed children, there were burgers smoking on the grill.  It was a classic weekend hangout, the kind of place where I feel at home, although my parents tried their hardest to raise me with all the affectations of the "intellectual elite."  Fuck that.  I am such a Kansas girl.  I love this place so much.  The green tall corn, the shimmering lake, the potbellied fisherman on the dock.  I am not so sad about staying here a little while longer.  It suits me fine.  I will miss my friend when she leaves.  I suppose half of what makes me feel like staying is that I am not alone.  And I will be, eventually.  My man might try to get a job here after he graduates, but I'd almost rather see him go far, because I know he can.  (But I'd be selfishly thrilled if he stayed nearby.)  He has a quality about him that marks him as a leader.  So maybe it'll just be me and the jilted boyfriend floating around on rafts in his swimming pool, talking about people who have forgotten us.  Oh, who am I kidding...I am going to have a goddamn great time in graduate school...If I ever remove myself from this computer and go do my homework!!

      Burning up the plastic, I am.  Just bought a ticket from New Haven CT to San Jose CA, finalizing my participation in a trip that's been in the works for a few months now.  I am strangely excited about our big road trip, although there's so much drama surrounding it that our plans might go up in smoke in the next three weeks or so.  I want to write about this more, but I think I will just wait to see what happens in the interim.  Spent the evening sleeping, the morning just sucking down motor oil coffee and bumming around in my bathing suit.  I fell asleep after swimming yesterday, just crashed right out with a book on my face.  My phone rang all night in the blankets next to me but I never woke up enough to answer it.  So much for my exciting Friday night!  I feel like listening to rock and roll and going to the lake.  I feel like sunshine and dandelion wine.  Last night I dreamed I was building a sandcastle.  (And so castles made of sand...melt into the sea...eventually...)  Lately I wonder what I am doing with my days, if I am spending them wisely or just wasting them.  I feel sometimes like I am throwing coins into a fountain.  But then again, I'd really regret it if I spent this time of my life all business.  So I am going to wait until my friend finishes writing a letter and get the hell outside.

      Can't stay away from this thing.  Notes from Underground has been waiting for me all day, but I can't seem to make myself read it.  My man's acting all weird today, and I hope it's nothing to do with me and how gooey I've been of late.  I guess I should be more careful what I say.  I forget how things can become distorted when they come out of my mouth, how threatening even the most unassuming admission of love can be.  Or maybe it's something else entirely.  I'm just afraid I might have screwed this up somehow, me and my big mouth.  Or maybe it's just me and my big ego, thinking obviously everything relates back to me.  Christ I am being neurotic.  Must stop now.  So fifteen minutes to go, and in my typical fashion, I am tapping away at the computer keys.  This workday has been less than productive.  I think I did one single work related thing.  The rest of my time on the clock has been spent fooling around, deep in conversation, deep in writing letters on e-mail.  I got this long letter from another old friend of my roommate's, one I really have forged a strange bond with over the past year.  I really have bogarted my roommate's friends, and though I resisted becoming entrenched in her social circle at first, I have pretty much become one of them.  Anyway, the guy calls me Cookie, which I find vaguely insulting and heartwarming at the same time, and I think if he lived up here, we'd hang out a lot.  He's an uber-nerd.  (Why can't I meet more of those?  I know they're around.)  People said he had a thing for me, but I'm positive there's nothing there.  Just the usual dose of complication arising from coed friendships.    But then again, I'm awfully dense about men...Actually, I am pretty dense about many many things.  Anyway, in my brief stint at actually doing my job today, I drove about campus and listened to bad rock and roll.  Billy Idol.  (Nice day for a white wedding.) Queen.  (Fat bottomed girls, you make the rockin' world go round!)  So I would be in high spirits, but for the weird atmosphere surrounding my man, with whom I am going to make a conscious effort to be less gooey with.  Okay.  I'm outta here!  Rock and Roll!

      So I've almost completed an entire shift at work, and during this final lap, with the finish line in view, I feel the need to give my blurty another go.    I am in the silliest of moods, having just spent the last half an hour exchanging insults with my favorite coworker and eating semi-rotten cherries from a plastic container.  Also read the local liberal rag that comes out of KC, The Pitch Weekly.  Mostly I shamelessly go for the romance classifieds and the horoscopes and the sex column.  (Dan Savage is one of my heroes.)  But this time, I read the whole thing, possibly because the idea of reading Dostoyevsky wasn't as appealing as I thought it would be when I put it in my backpack last night.  When I have to start teaching, I am going to start using a briefcase.  Backpacks to Briefcases, that's the KU motto.  Like it's some kind of vocational school.  Like most of us don't move back in with our folks and spend 40 hours a week in 'cubes.  Anyway, I am going to get a briefcase, but on the first day of class, when there are 27 pairs of eyes looking at me, I am probably going to open it up and vomit in it.    Vomit, which rather reminds me of our Lord Jesus...Yes, Eddie Izzard is one of my heroes as well, recently introduced to me by my roommate and boyfriend.    My boyfriend.  Now there's a topic that I can't seem to exhaust.  He makes me want to pick flowers.  Oh, but there is something I have yet to address, and that has nothing whatsoever to do with flowers...  One thing about the holiday I took with my man was that we were in such close company for so long that the last vestiges of anything hidden about myself and my life completely evaporated.  Sure, I have my hidden thoughts and that solitary part of myself that nobody sees, the writer part of myself, the things I couldn't and wouldn't ever try to explain.  But tell you what, I really laid myself as open as can be.  For one thing, whatever remnants of feminine mystique I had been clinging to--Gone after my man witnessed me eat a chili smothered hot dog as big as my forearm.  The term "riotous dump" was coined that day.  And, though I'm sure he's known it for a while now, I told him I loved him.  God I wish I had not said that while I was intoxicated.  I wish, in some regards, that I had not said it at all.   I meant it, and I am confident he can't burn out my heart any more now than he ever could have just because I finally broke down and said it.  But those are some mighty words.  Mighty words.  Fourteen minutes left, and I will be fancy free until tomorrow.  One thing about taking a bunch of time off work is that the weeks seem mercifully short.  Today is Hump Day (which also reminds me rather of our Lord Jesus).  I have to start working on school because it will be over soon.  How in the hell is the time flying by so fast?  In spite of how grossly the minutes stretch out while I am here in this dingy vault plugging away at this keyboard, generally this summer has gone by in overdrive.  In less than a month, I will be in Santa Cruz.  In less that two months, I will be in graduate school.    In October, I will turn twenty-four.  Now there is a sobering thought.  I remember celebrating my husband's twenty-fourth birthday.  I had just turned twenty-one.  Our birthdays were a day apart.  I played "Old Man" by Neil Young (24 and there's so much more).  I used to think he was the paragon of wisdom, world weary old twenty-four.  God it's scary, being an adult.  You realize that nobody is really running this show, that every adult you think of as responsibly holding the reigns of society is just a kid who grew up.    I tease my man that he will have to buy me a four-footed cane and whip up Metamucil shakes for me.  Man I am so obnoxious.  I act like he's such a baby, when in all reality, I will probably outlive him.  Isn't that awful, how women always stick around forever and ever, accumulating cats and getting battier with every year?    I haven't filled these last few minutes, but that is probably rather a good thing.

      We made it out of Kansas after all.    Where should I begin?  I haven't much time today.  I am back to work, having been AWOL yesterday, and I feel ragged as hell.  This weekend was magic, so many worthy memories packed into 72 hours that I can't even begin to record them all.  I will say these 5 things:  1.   On Independence Day, on the veranda of a hotel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas, over a bottle of Crown and a pack of Camels, I realized that I found the right man after all.  We are nearly comic in how opposite we are, so much that sometimes I still have a laugh about it.  I don't know if we're going to be in it for the long haul or not, and I don't much care.  Right now, in this period of our lives, we are perfect for each other.    2.  We drank moonshine with a man known as "Billy Club" and got pierced.  Billy, bless his blunt and rowdy heart, was one of the coolest people I have ever had the opportunity to meet.  3.  In the heat, in the sun, on the road, flying past fields of cows and ghost towns and fast food restaurants, I was so happy and thankful I thought my heart would break.  4.  We made it home an entire day late.  Wild nights.  5.  It's good to be home.  So there.  If I had unlimited hours, I would record every minute.  But I don't really need to--It's commited to memory.  Life is going to change, come August, but I hope against hope that I can hold onto this feeling.

      Can I stay away from this thing for one goddamn day?  I suppose not.  I'm so goddamn tired, having stayed up until deep dawn to hear the birds sing, only to climb out of bed at noon to go running in the hot sun.  I love the running, and god knows I need to keep it up, but I am still at the stage where my physique isn't exactly bending to my will.  I can make myself go for two miles, but it still hurts like hell and I keep hearing this old blues tune riffing in my head while I shuffle my poor little legs down the trail:  My body's built for comfort, not for speed...My body's built for comfort, not for speed...My body's built...  But at least I am doing it, and it feels good in some ways.  Like yesterday, when it rained and my man and I decided to go outside anyway.  We ran soaking wet through the park and watched the swollen runoff ditches swirling with brown water and threw mock punches at each other.  That was a good thing.  Went to the bookstore yesterday eve, which is financial suicide.  More old British literature for me to while away the hours with.  Also bought A Confederacy of Dunces, Pulitzer Prize winner and cult classic.  I got my credit card renewed, so I've been spending freely.  But I know this is bad news for me, as much as I dig my new cd's and used books.  I have a wee problem with putting immediate gratification to the side.  I want to spend my twenties fancy fee and living it up.  I won't be this free ever again, and I always justify my bar hopping and pleasure tripping and book buying with the thought that I won't want to look back at this time in my life and see  a string of dull nights.  (A fallacy I know.)  What else... Oh , how can I forget.  My roommate and the boys went to KC yesterday night, just to get out of town.  Our excuse was the city wide smoking ban on all public places, but really I think we were all just eager for a change of scenery.  We ended up at the kind of bar where Poison and Motely Crue play loudly all night and the patrons (predominantly white middle thirties males) all headbang and do air guitar when they believe nobody is watching.  It was a good place, don't get me wrong.  But I have had my year's quota of shitty hair rock after last night.  I watched my friends play pool and tried to prevent myself from being left alone with my roommate's boyfriend, who is so whiny and immature and dull that I can't think of one thing to say to him after knowing him for nearly a year and a half.  Today my man and I are supposed to go on an adventure.  No idea where we're going, but I'm betting we won't get too far.  Probably won't make it out of Kansas, but that's fine with me.  While I was trying to take a nap this afternoon, I found the end of my story.  It came to me while I tossed and turned in the heat of my apartment.  It always happens that way, ideas rushing in from the periphery when I least expect.  My roommate and I discussed our pending road trip today.  Our fab four has been long planning an excursion around her move to Yale.  She wants to close the book on her man, but he's the one providing transport to Connecticut.  Now she's saying we should rent a U Haul and ditch the guys, which is okay with me.  But god this is getting complicated.    Well, adventure awaits.

      Well, back on the chain gang.  I owe my boss a six pack instead of ten bucks, which is pretty kind on my part, considering he wanted a draw as bad as I did.  I am just happy to be connected again, free to fill my shift with lots of happy shiny internet experiences.  The past few days have been as good as I could have hoped.  My man's home, finally, and we're still enjoying a mood of celebration about his return.  He came home three shades darker and a few inches skinnier, with lots of stories involving alcoholic binges and the police and the miseries of playing war games in the tropics.  What a trip.    He says he missed me, and I can't believe my good fortune.  Seems to me that I am a good woman and all that, but it's hard for me to believe that he finds me as beautiful as he does.  It's odd, but I could almost believe in the vision he has of me, that I am just so amazing.  But then again, it's in my interest not to care one way or another.  I will always be glad for the things he says to me.  No man ever has said them to me before.    We got crocked at a restaurant the other night and ended up weaving around downtown laughing at nothing.  And one night I had the best time sitting on the stoop with my roommate, talking about love and the meaning of life and smoking cigarettes.  I also had a sweet night of sleep last night, after a miserable day at work where I found myself dry heaving in the restroom from uncharacteristically bad cramps.  I took some pain pills I had squirreled away after a car accident a while back and floated off on a pharmaceutical wave to Dreamland.  And today it's raining like hell and I love it.  So life has been lovely, and it's funny how when I am happy I have little to say.  "And this too shall come to pass."  As little as this resonates with me these days, I feel that this is worth noting.  I remember telling a friend once that the only constant in my life has been the passage of time.  Time erases all hurts and minimizes all adversities.  Let go of something, and the current will pull you away and leave whatever it was washed up on some bank for someone else to find.  Keep something close, though, and time leaves it alone till you die.  I guess people ask me a lot of questions about how I have dealt with things like death and heartache, and I haven't done  a thing.  I just counted on time washing it away.  As I will be washed away, someday.  Anyway, enough of the 'deep thoughts.'  I just feel like it's something worth recalling.
