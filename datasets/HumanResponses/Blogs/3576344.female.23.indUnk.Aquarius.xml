      Every Monday I go to Karaoke at the local gay bar with a group of friends.  A number of the folks in this group identify themselves as being completely straight, but everyone is pretty open-minded.  (closed minded people, don't go to gay bars, dummy [you know  you're getting too bitchy when you even feel compelled to mock yourself])  The topic of sexuality is an ongoing theme, and I've noticed an interesting division in beliefs surrounding basic human sexuality.  It seems that there are two  predominant schools of thought on the issue.  The first group believes that people are either straight or gay, and anyone identifying themselves as bi-sexual is confused and/or horny.  The second group believes in a sliding scale of sexuality, that everyone is at least a little bi-sexual and anyone identifying themselves as straight or gay is merely falling prey to societies need to compartmentalize everyone.  I'm not saying there aren't other views, but the ones that I've heard tend to fall easily into one of these two categories.  Now I realize I'm oversimplifying this, but it's pretty obvious that the first group identify themselves as either straight or gay, and the second group identify themselves as bi-sexual (I'm using this term in the loosest possible sense, lumping folks who are attracted to both sexes in with those who act on those attractions)  Of course there are exceptions, and while discussing this topic with a (self proclaimed bi-sexual, nonetheless) friend he was quick to point out a friend of his who also believed in the sliding scale theory, who was not herself bi-sexual, but upon further investigation (time for me to quit reading mysteries for awhile I fear) she had admitted that she found women attractive, but would classify herself as being only ever so slightly bi-sexual. (Aha!)  If you're following my logic so far (my logic always makes sense to me, but not everyone has my particular skewed brand of reasoning) it's not a big jump to conclude that this is yet another example of us mere mortals formulating our beliefs to support our lifestyles.  Now I'm gonna go way out on a limb here, and I'm probably gonna have to turn the comment feature off, as I'm likely gonna piss EVERYONE off, (don't let that stop you from commenting, I actually want feedback on this) but here's the way I see it: Deep down inside the folks who believe you can only be straight or gay, with no in-betweens have feelings of guilt and doubt about this, we've all read the history books (ok with the educational system the way it is these days I could be wrong on that, but we'll save that topic for another day) bi-sexuality isn't new, and maybe that makes them question their sexuality, just a little, makes them wonder "what's wrong with me, am I homophobic, biased, bigoted, discriminatory..." (my mind is longwinded like that, the running thesaurus can come in handy when you're plagiarising papers though [I've never actually plagerised a paper, but I have used my own papers for different classes, adding and subtracting ideas as necessary])  As for the sliding scale crew, there's the obvious "am I going to go to Hell for this?" thing, (the homosexual community also has to deal with this) this is a big deal, even folks who don't believe in Hell still have to wonder from time to time if Hell believes in them. (trite, I know, but sometimes things become trite for a reason) In addition to that they have to worry about how society views them, bi-sexuals (especially males) aren't well liked by either the gay or straight communities, and of course there's the "slut" stigma.  Having the world think you're an indiscriminate lover can't be good for your self-esteem.  Now before all my friends who read this stop talkin to me, I just wanna say I don't think straight or gay people are  bigoted, and I don't think bi-sexuals are sluts.  I do think that everyone wants to be accepted, and worries that they won't be.  I think we all want desperately to be individuals, while still being seen as "normal"   What do you think?

      I believe that in order to forgive our parents for not being the perfect beings we wish they had been, we have to recognize all the adversity they overcame in their lives, and how much they tried to shield us.  We all came from somewhere, and while the whole may be greater than the sum of it's parts, all those parts are still factors in determining the kind of people, and parents we will be.  (wow, that's pretty cool, I should make a t-shirt or something)  Daddy grew up in New Jersey, in an upper-middle class family.  His Father was an abusive alcoholic, his Mother (reportedly) a saint, she left his Father when he was 8 years old, leaving Daddy and his little brother Ian with dear old Dad.  His dad remarried a few years later, gaining him a step-mother with an appetite for little boys. As a child I constantly pestered my Daddy with questions about his childhood, this is a normal developmental stage, however I never really got over it, probably due to the fact that he was very secretive about much of his childhood, most of the details I know, I learned from my older sisters, after he had died.  Daddy didn't like to tell sad stories, and, from what I gather, there weren't a whole lot of happy stories that stuck out in his mind from his early years.  He contracted polio when he was 14, the doctors told him he would never walk again.  The one time his Father visited him in the hospital, he asked him "how could you do this to me?"  Respectable families didn't have crippled sons. He vowed to himself that he would walk again, and that winter, he bribed his little brother to wheel him down to the pond at the edge of their property, in the middle of the night.  They both would put ice skates on, and Ian would tow him around by a rope.  Week by week the muscles in his legs grew, and by the time the winter was over he was walking again.  He waited until his Father's birthday to share the good news, but instead of the tearful congratulations that you would expect, his Father was outraged to find out he had gone behind his back. Shortly thereafter he ran away from home, and at this point the details on his life get real fuzzy for awhile, I know he did some traveling by hopping on trains, and for awhile he lived with a family (I'm conflicted here, Daddy was always quick to point out that this was a black family, but I don't think that should make a lick of difference, so I'll compromise by making a longwinded parenthetical statement about it) that had been live-in servants when his mother was still around.  I think (and this is purely conjecture on my part, but as all the parties involved are deceased, it's effectively my story at this point, so I can tell it however I want) he probably tried to track down his mother, I know that she had also remarried, and it seems likely that her new husband wasn't too keen on the idea of having another mans child living with him, in any event, we lose track of our hero for the next decade or so.  He spoke sometimes of a period in his life when he could drink anyone under the table, (by the time I was born, he drank one glass of blackberry wine a year, on Christmas) I assume this was the period in question, I know that he had been married and divorced twice by the time he was 27, and had a child by one of them, but he never talked about the child, and only spoke of one of the women, and only in passing, as she was a figure-skater. ("I was married to a figure-skater once," that sort of thing) At the age of 27 he was working at a high-school in Virginia (funny how much Virginia high-schools come in to play in my parentage, it's pure coincidence, but strange, nonetheless) coaching baseball, basketball, football, and soccer (overcompensating?  nah) this was where he met his 3rd wife, and the mother of 5 of my older sisters, Pat.  She was 15 and a sophomore in high-school, when they eloped, nine months later their first daughter, Dawn was born.  Over the course of the next 6 years, they had 4 more daughters (Caron, Lisa, Deborah and Ami, in that order) and moved to California, where Daddy took a job with IBM as a systems analyst and started training horses on the side.  This left Pat, at 22, with 5 daughters, and a husband who was rarely around, roughly 3000 miles from home.   Over the next 7 years, Daddy quit his job at IBM, and turned to the more lucrative career of horse training full time.  All of his daughters were chapionship riders in their respective age groups, and his horses were winning shows left and right, he was soon one of the most respected trainers in California. (this isn't just bragging, I've seen the trophies, ribbons, photographs and newspaper articles) He was pretty much on top of the world.  Then, at the age of 29 his wife Pat, took her own life.  Caron had seen the bottle of sleeping pills, empty by the bed, and when she was unable to wake her Mother, had gone to get Daddy.  Pat wasn't quite gone when he got to her, and he picked her up, intending to take her to the hospital, just as he got outside the house, she woke up, looked into his eyes, said "you really do love me" and then died moments later.   Apparently she was four months pregnant when she died, and not with his child, but Daddy never forgave himself for her death.  Over the next decade he moved to Oregon, had a string of celebrity style (short) marriages, went back to school, earning 5 masters degrees in 4 years, continued to train horses, took up teaching psychology at a Community College, and pretty much left his daughters, who had been between the ages of 7 and 14 when their mother died, to take care of themselves.   He had another daughter, Holly, and from the sound of things, was finally beginning to heal, when his wife left him, and moved to California.  He hired a private investigator, and learned that his now ex-wife was pregnant again, and assumed that the baby was fathered by the man she had run off with.  He was actually awarded custody of Holly by the courts, but at the time, once she hit California, it wasn't enforceable.  It turns out, the baby was actually the boy Daddy had always dreamed of, Holly had been searching for her long lost family for years, and finally found us on a website Caron had joined, hoping someday to find Holly, only months after Daddy died.  He never knew he had a son. (of course, no paternity testing was ever done, but the resemblance is irrefutable) Well I guess that brings us, again, to the birth of yours truly, for the record, I weighed in at a whopping 8lbs 8oz, and I didn't cry when I was born.

      My Daddy always used to say I should write a book about my life when I became hugely successful, but since it seems that might take awhile (like eternity) and I'm already starting to forget some of the finer details, (plus who has time to write a book when they're busy being hugely successful?) I figure I'll get a jump start on it here.  Probably, I'm just gonna end up with a bunch of silly stories about when I was a kid, but heck, ya'll aren't paying for this, and it's not like you have to read it if you don't want to.  (although I should warn you, I may test you later)  My biological parents:  Ruby and Richie grew up in Roanoke VA, a college town, not too different from the one I live in now.  Ruby's Mother was a little on the crazy side, and she got worse the older she got, once she hit 50 the doctors started calling it alzheimer's.  Ruby's Father died when she was young, she and her sister Phentrice were primarily raised by her Aunt, and namesake, "Auntie Ruby."  She grew up poor, and proud of it. (a peculiar trait that the south seems to foster) Richie's Mother was an elementary school teacher, his father was an Insurance adjuster, just your typical middle-class family, right down to the alcoholic Father.  He was one of those kids who kept his nose in a book, and wouldn't play sports if his life depended on it.  (So that's where I get it from) They met in high-school, during a production of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead. (Richie played Rosencrantz, Ruby had a bit part and helped out with the sets)  When my Mama talks about it, she makes it sound as if he were larger than life, as if she knew the moment she saw him that it was love, but truth be told, they didn't actually end up dating until she ran into his car.  (my Mama gets into more fender benders)  How romantic is that, she hit his car, (she was stoned at the time, you know, maybe if she didn't drive stoned she wouldn't hit so many things, maybe I'll suggest it to her) and that fostered their romance.  They dated through the rest of high school, broke up for awhile while he started in college and she went on a cross-country motorcycle ride with her high school English teacher, eventually landing her in the town she now calls home. Ruby was so impressed by the pacific northwest that even after her affair with Mr. Should-have-known-better-to-run-off-with-one-of-his-students was over, she knew she wanted to live here.  Practicality, however, got the better of her (temporarily, practicality never gets the better of my Mama for long) and she moved back home to attend college.  Within a couple of terms Richie had quit going to school, in favor of living in Ruby's dorm room (at a different school, about 50 miles away) before long she had planted the idea of this magical hippie land, where it was "green" as far as the eye could see in his head, and they packed up, and headed out in search of greener pastures. (sorry about that last pun, but sometimes a girl just can't help herself) They both enrolled in community college, and found a nice little commune to live in, in the traditional hippie style, and before you could shake a fertility goddess, Ruby was pregnant.  To Richie's mind, abortion was the only option, as they were certainly not in any position to have a child, Ruby, fearing what her family would say, should she have a child born out of wedlock, agreed.  Afterwards she was devastated, and just as she was beginning to move on she became pregnant again.  She was adamantly opposed to aborting this child, but Richie swore he would leave her if she chose to keep it.   They sought help from Scott, a psychology teacher they had both taken a number of classes from, who offered free counseling to his students.  He had just gone through a divorce, losing custody of his 3 year old daughter in the process, and, at the age of 54 offered to adopt their baby.  Of course there were conditions, on both sides, neither Ruby or Richie wanted their parents to find out about the baby, and Ruby wanted to be sure she'd be able to see the baby, should she want to.  Scott told them after the baby was born they'd have 2 months to change their minds, (he loved to tell this story) after that, he said he'd "fight them to the death" to keep it. I was born in a  birthing center (a compromise between a home birth and a hospital birth) about 2 weeks late (I still have a hard time getting up in the morning) My Daddy (Scott)delivered me, and took me home 2 hours later. Richie saw me once, when I was about 2 weeks old, he died of a heat stroke (caused by copious quantities of amphetamines) in Arizona at the age of 21, I was a year old.

      Last night I dreamt about sex.  (if you didn't want to know that I suggest you stop reading, the weather is nice, go for a walk or something) This is highly unusual for me, I understand that men have sexual dreams on a semi-regular basis, but this was only the 3rd sexual dream I've had, ever, and the first one was just kissing, but it was really satisfying kissing, so it counts. This is the first time I've known the person I was, uhm, sleeping with (err..you know what I mean) and it's disturbing me.  This is someone I like and respect, honestly he's someone I would date, were I single. How do you look someone in the eye, once you've dreamt about them in this fashion, the next time I see him I'll probably turn bright red and start stuttering, I mean this is embarrassing shit.  It wasn't just the sex either, it was the whole thing, this was a very in-depth dream, and it was nice, I mean really nice.  There was hand-holding, and cuddling on the couch, there were conversations, I even remember thinking at one point "so THIS is what I've been missing" and everybody still had their clothes on.  (it got better from there, but I'm trying not to embarrass myself too much here)  And I really have no business thinking this, much less typing it, so forgive me, but I can't help wondering if the real thing would live up to my little fantasy.   Now you all know I'm a good little girl, and I'm not gonna act on my wild fantasies, so if you're hoping I'm talking about you (yes, I really AM that self-absorbed) don't try to corner me, I'd probably just kick you in the shin. You're wishing you'd gone for that walk now, aren't you?

      How much can you compromise, how much can you give in how much of yourself are you willing to lose so he can win how much is a vow worth is it worth your heart you know you'll never love him again and it's tearing you apart and how many times will you listen to lies how many will you ignore what's it gonna take to get you to make the choice to walk out the door or will you keep compromising keep giving in will you lose the best of yourself to let him win and if you're gonna stay that's the price you must pay like it or not but at least you can say at the end of the day you gave it your best shot girl, don't compromise don't give in never lose yourself so someone else can win

      Wow, who knew? (I guess lotsa folks did, just not me) I had more fun last night, completely sober, than I have in, well, in too long.  I have an icky scratch on my arm, I think I twisted my ankle (nothing serious it's just a little swollen) and my legs are REALLY sore.  I wanna do it again!  I knew there had to be some sort of physical group activity out there that I would like. (get your mind out of the gutter)  I got exercise and I didn't hate it!  Yay!  Oodles of thanks go out to Aaron for making this happen, you made my weekend hon.

      That's a quote, but I probably butchered it, and I don't know who I'm quoting, so I guess I should have just pretended I made it up.  It's been one of those weeks.  I've been having really vivid dreams lately, probably because I haven't been getting much sleep.  Last night I had two dreams where I was dying, how creepy is that?  In both cases they were slow prolonged and completely avoidable deaths, caused by my refusal to make choices I knew I had to make. I hate when that happens. What am I trying to tell myself?  Choosing not to decide is still a choice, dummy    I've been facing some pretty difficult choices as of late, and have even gone so far as to ask the universe for guidance, you know that whole "show me a sign" thing.  I never expected that crap to work.  You see, I hate change, I mean really, really, really hate change.  I'm trying to get over it, but it's a tough habit to break.  I'm the kid who took that "one in the hand is worth two in the bush" thing to heart, not to mention "the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence."  I'm sure there are more, and they wouldn't be cliches if there wasn't some truth to them.  Anyway, I got my sign, and it probably won't change a gosh darned thing, I mean really, it's not as though I didn't already know what I ought to do to start with, it's just that sometimes I'm incredibly dumb.   Never underestimate the ability of a woman to ignore logic, reason, and common sense, in favor of not making waves.  In significantly less creepy and depressing dream news, I had a dream last night that ComedySportz teamed up with a (really bad) magicians group for some shows at the Eugene Celebration.  I don't remember a lot of details, but at one point they were doing a sleight of hand trick involving a Foreman grill and hamburger patties.(not a bad idea when you think about it....dinner and a show)    *******************  About yesterday's post: 1- This was in reference to mock show done at a CSz workshop, and had nothing to do with Karaoke 2- Notes are, well, basically notes on how to improve your performance, and have nothing to do with Karaoke 3- I didn't mean to imply that anyone was faking anything 4- That whole thing about it being just as bad as I had feared it might be, it's a good thing (maybe you have to be in my brain to follow the logic here but I'm gonna try anyhow) you see, I made it, it was just as bad as I figured it could be, but it was ok (ok maybe I can't explain it, that makes no fu**ing sense at all) at the end of the night I still had ten fingers, ten toes, two breasts, the world didn't come to an end, and I know it won't be as bad next time. (that's better) 5- I have a really hard time taking compliments, I always feel compelled to be a smartass, it's easier for me to deal with criticism (although I guess I handle it pretty much the same way, but hey, smartass looks good on me) 6- this had nothing to do with Karaoke

      To all of you who gave me a thumbs up, pat on the back, or words of encouragement last night, Thank you.  I needed it. That went about as badly as I had feared it might, all of the things I was afraid might happen did, but there were a couple of good moments too. (and bless you Russell for pointing every last one of them out)  That said, quit being so damned nice to me. (goodness knows I don't return the favor) The closest thing I got to a note last night was so sugar coated it would make twinkies seem sour.  I'm a big girl, I can take it as well as I dish it.

      I saw "Jersey Girl" yesterday, I'd seen previews for it, and I was expecting it to be more touchy-feely than the rest of his movies, but I had no idea what I was in for.    For the record I'm not the kind of girl who cries in sad movies, in fact I'm not the kind of girl who cries in public at all.  I'm the kind of girl who blinks repeatedly until the urge to cry passes.  You see, there are women in the world who look beautiful beyond compare when they cry, the tears make their eyes sparkle, their bodies tremble ever so gently.  At the first sign of a tear these women become irresistibly kissable, their vulnerability heightening their beauty, these are the women that romantic movies are made of.  I am not one of these women.  When I cry my face gets red and blotchy, my nose runs, and my eyes become bloodshot.   This movie was the exception to my rule. (I suppose it could be argued that a movie theater isn't exactly "public" what with the lack of light and all, but still it's too public for this little girl's taste)  I think I started crying about 20 minutes in, and I don't think I made it more than 10 minutes after that without at least a sniffle.  There are a number of factors involved in my overly emotional response to this movie, including, but not limited to:  1) A strong bond between a single father and daughter. (this shit gets me every time, normally I avoid movies like this like the plague) 2) I hadn't yet overcome my gloom surrounding Father's Day.  And 3)  The leading lady (played by Liv Tyler)reminded me of myself in a huge way. I'm glad I saw it, and chances are I'll buy it when it comes out on video, cause what the hey, any movie that can evoke that strong of an emotional response is worth owning.  If you haven't seen it yet, wait til it comes out on video, and keep a box of tissues handy. (if you don't at least tear up at some point you have no heart)  ******* On a completely unrelated topic, those of you who know me may (or may not) have noticed that I have studiously avoided mention of a certain someone in my life.  He doesn't know about this blog, and ideally I'd like to keep it that way.  Please don't bring it up, should he for some reason be around.  Also I'm delighted that a couple of you have chosen to share this with your readers, but if you'd be kind enough to leave my name out of it I'd be forever in you debt.  I'm sure this sounds a little on the paranoid side, but humor me.

      My "team" at work is moving to the other side of the building and in the process I'm getting new cube-mates. (we have 4 people to a cube) Currently I share my cube with 3 great older ladies, who read romance novels like they're going out of style and try to shock me with their dirty jokes.  So far I've only met one of the new folks I'll be sharing space with.  He came up to me today and asked me if I picked my nose (really, I don't make this stuff up) he went on to tell me he's had a problem with nose-picking cube-mates.  OK maybe I'm a little old fashioned, but where I come from we introduce ourselves before we start asking personal questions.  For that matter we don't ask people that sort of question at all, never in my life have I asked even my closest friends if they pick their noses, it's just not done.  Now I realize he was only joking, and of course being the good sport I pretend to be at work I joked back, but I don't think this bodes well for me. I have a low tolerance for blatant stupidity.

      As the children of the world hastily go to Fred Meyer's and Wal-mart to pick up a last minute gift that their Dad will thank them for, and in many cases even appreciate, but nonetheless never use, I smile and laugh, pretending this holiday doesn't break my heart.

      I suspect what I was trying to say (although I could be wrong, as it's 3 in the morning, and my mind is just a little on the foggy side) is that despite the fact that I'm feeling all nostalgic for my misspent youth, I'm really quite lucky in a lot of respects.  For one, I turned out a heck of a lot better than many of my peers, and what's more I actually have some friends who are relatively sane (comparatively speaking, of course) and who (or is it whom?) I really do care about and appreciate.  I hope you know who you are.  I have a tendency to assume folks know how I feel about them.  I'm not a terribly emotionally demonstrative person these days, but chances are if you're reading this you either have a special little place in my heart, or you don't know me, and happened upon this quite by accident, and will probably never be back.  Either way, don't expect me to be nice again for awhile, it takes a lot out of me.

      Been thinking about my teenage years a lot lately, God I was a piece of work.  I miss those feelings of invincibility, the unfaltering belief in happy endings, and having the world at my fingertips.  I miss being fearless and stupid.  I miss the sex, drugs and rock & roll, life's a little more  masturbation, alcohol and easy listening these days. (could be worse though, there's always frigidity, prozac and country [for the record I have nothing against country, but it does tend to be just a smidgen on the depressing side])  To be fair though there's a lot of stuff I don't miss too, I had some seriously bad taste in people back then, for example:    The Community College Cafeteria Crowd:    "The Virgin" was a Catholic girl who was saving herself for marriage, so she would only have oral and anal sex with her  boyfriends. (?????)  This lasted until she was 19, when she lost her virginity to a guy who 3 days later left the state, to avoid going to jail on a number of different charges.  Towards the end of our friendship she got involved with some folks who were creating their own religion. (fabulous stuff, including psycic powers, astral projection and energy manipulation, let me tell you these folks had way too much time on their hands) Last I heard she was on her 3rd husband and addicted to meth.  "The burrito bandito" was my second "boyfriend" we were in French 101 together, and he used to help me "study" (I apologize for all the quotes folks) after class. (there's just something about making out in the French classroom, if you ever get the chance I highly recommend it) We dated for 11 days, I broke up with him for being a dumbass, he was 86ed from the cafeteria for doing exactly what this nickname implies.  Last time I saw him he was still dumb, but I think the petty larceny phase has passed.  "The Geek" was actually a really nice guy, almost a textbook nerd though, he wore anime t-shirts, had coke bottle glasses, you get the picture.  He married his high school sweetheart and he now works for a computer software company where even his co-workers think he's a little too nerdy.   "The mother" was reminiscent of any Hollywood trashy single mother of teenagers with a heart living in a trailer park, she was a good person, with a lot of little quirks, including an affinity for sex with people around the same age as her kids, I stayed with her for a couple of weeks  during a "transitional period" she got me drunk one night and tried to take advantage of me (the funny thing about this is her daughter who was about 4 years my senior had tried the same thing the night before)  "The arsonist #1" wasn't actually a student, he just like to hang out with us, this was boyfriend #3 for me (1 month) and the first guy I went past 1st base with (lucky guy) he had beautiful eyes, and absolutely nothing else going for him.  He was one of those guys who thought the "that's what she said" jokes were brilliantly funny.  He went to jail for a number of years for setting fire to a couple of cars and the woodshop of a local high school.  Last I heard he was making a living selling drugs.  "The arsonist #2" dated "The mother" for awhile, he was a pretty talented musician, and a relatively good student until he hooked up with #1 and went on a burning spree, he was jailed for 5 years for the above mentioned high school fire, and came out with bigger muscles, a smaller brain, and a mountain of debt, last I heard he was working 2 jobs and living with his father. (poor guy)  "The sexually ambiguous guy" was confused.  The first year I knew him he was straight and single, the next year he was gay and in a relationship, the next year he was straight and married, Oh and he had a creepy habit of wearing a cloak everywhere he went.  Last I heard he was getting married again to another woman.  I gotta say I called that one wrong, never thought he turn out straight.    "The Goth chick" was often quoted as saying "all I want is a guy with a job, a car, and a penis."  You know the type, black lipstick, a wardrobe of black and army green, and an attitude out to there.  She liked to try to shock people, but she had a heart of gold.  I don't know what ever happened to her, but I hope she found her guy.   "The sarcastic guy" was the reason yours truly didn't see the Star Wars movies until last year, but that's another story.  He was one of those people who never had anything nice to say to anyone, unless he wanted something from them, but he was hilarious.  I guess he got a little less jaded later in life, and  I hear he actually made something of himself but by then he'd burned his bridges.  "The Jay" (as in Jay and silent Bob) if you've seen any of Kevin Smith's movies, just imagine Jay more hyper and annoying, and you'd have this guy.  (if you haven't seen any Kevin Smith movies where on earth have you been) At one point he actually had his throat slit by an ex-girlfriend (or so he said, some have theorized that he did it himself, but that's just too weird for this little girl to contemplate)  Last I heard he could talk again.  And of course there was me, When I met most of these people I was 14 years old, I had been in college for a year and a half , and I had a 4.0 GPA.  I was Daddy's little angel, but it didn't last. (it never does) I made all sorts of mistakes, and went through all sorts of stages, but you can hear some of those stories another day.  I'm pretty sure I had a point when I started this, but it's lost on me now, and I'm too lazy to go back up to the beginning and figure it out.

      ComedySportz workshop was kinda strange last night, only 7 people showed up, and we spent the first 45 min sitting around, the next hour playing warm-up games and the last 15 min playing line games, and making totally inappropriate jokes.  Don't get me wrong, I had a good time, but the funny thing is I've spent the last few months wishing we'd stick to warm up games, so I wouldn't have to get up on stage and embarrass myself, but these last couple of weeks I've actually wanted to get up there, I still feel like a dumbass while I'm there, but I'm not minding so much.   A couple of folks have brought up the idea of me actually playing recently, I've got some seriously mixed feelings there.  It seems like I'm pretty awful at just about all of this stuff; my mime sucks, I can't do an accent to save my life, and I'd be great at scenework if only I moved and talked.  But I want to be good at all this stuff, and deep down inside somewhere I get a little giddy at the thought of actually playing.  Naturally I'm confident that I'm totally brilliant, beautiful, witty, and charming. (now why would I want to get up in front of an audience and prove myself wrong?)    Had a rough night after workshop, you ever get sick of having the same argument over and over again?   Couldn't sleep again, the insomnia is really starting to wear on me.  Time to get some more sleeping pills. Ok enough of my whining.

      This may be the most interesting insult I've ever received. (and let me tell you, err nevermind, you don't need to know) Now what exactly do you suppose he meant by that?  Is pondwater worse than tap water?  How about ocean water or pool water?  Is he inferring that I'm a floater, or a fish? (those of you familiar with my drinking habits can kindly refrain from commenting on that last bit)  Maybe it's some sort of roundabout way of telling me he thinks it my "time of the month" (water retention and all.)   In any event, it makes a girl's life difficult when people come up with insults this amusing, do you have any idea how hard it is to stifle a giggle when someone says something so inane?  The problem is, if you don't manage to stifle the giggle, folks tend to get a little more creative with their insults (or possible less creative, and more mean)  So, if you're on the phone with a customer service representative, and feel the need to attempt to belittle them (this won't work, we don't care what you think)please stick to old standbys like:  You're full of (insert poop word here) Go to (insert bad place here)  anyway, you get the idea

      Daddy mighta been the Devil, But he loved her Mama mighta been a saint, but she was never around Somewhere in the middle,  there's an angel just like her with her head in the clouds, and her feet on the ground  Daddy liked to preach, the value of honesty He taught her how lie, and how to believe it Daddy died,  when she was just seventeen You can run from the world, until you leave it  And then a Couple years later, She met a man It was love at first sight, if you can believe him A girl finds a guy as much like her Daddy, as she can then spends the rest of her life, tryin to leave him

      I saw Riddick yesterday, all and all I liked it, although I must say I was very disappointed that Vin (my hero) kept his shirt on (now I ask you, what's the point of having a chest like that if you're gonna keep your shirt on? It's just criminal)  Anyhow, the ending wasn't my cup of tea, but I'm not the type who hates a movie just cause it ends poorly, 5 bad minutes don't negate the remainder of the movie.  In other entertainment news, I saw Sam's second to last ComedySportz show on Friday, It was a great show.  Even though I never really got to know him, I'm gonna miss him.  I hope Chicago treats him well.

      So I'm actually kinda new at all this computer stuff, until lately I'd pretty much relied on other people to figure out all the details for me.  I have some sort of strange  magnetic field around me that causes most electronic devices to run away screaming at the very sight of me. (this is quite a sight, especially at computer labs and cyber cafes) OK maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration, but I can't keep a watch working for more than 3 months, my alarm clock will fail to go off when it is set, and sometimes goes off when it isn't, and computers hate me with a red and fiery passion.   Now the funny thing about this (or rather the thing I find funny, mean people who take joy in the misery of others find my predicament highly amusing) is I work with computers now, in fact, I'm at work right now (I work really really hard) last week I was having this problem with one of the programs at work, every morning as I tried to open it would do stuff (technical term)it wasn't supposed to, and every morning I would call my supervisor over (he must really hate me) and he would fix it.  Now can someone explain to me why when I rebooted it didn't help, but when he rebooted it fixed everything?  How does the computer know when it's me?  They got the computer guy over and now it works again, no supervisor approval needed, but I'm sure it'll find something new and obnoxious to do next week. This week I've been trying to get this blog started, mind you I'm doing this all by myself, without any help from my computer savvy friends, so it's a long process, with much hair pulling, and a few bargains being struck with the universe.  The good news is the universe is responding, the bad news is it seems to have a 12-16 hour delay this week.  I spent all day Wednesday (at work mind you, and I do actually have to work sometimes, it's not like I actually spent the entire 8 hours on it) getting this thing set up, only to get an error message at the end of the night as I was trying to post, naturally I assumed that meant it hadn't worked, (not a big shock to me, considering my track record)  but to my utter astonishment, when I logged on yesterday it had worked.  This made me jump up and down with glee (earning me perplexed looks from my co-workers, as well as a resigned sigh, and a shake of his head from my supervisor [he must really, really hate me]) it also gave me an overinflated sense of my computer skills, and inspired me to further frustrate myself. I decided what I really needed was a site counter, so I'd know if anyone is actually reading all this blather.  I set out on this endeavor totally ignorant of what it would entail, HTML and java script were mere theoretical concepts to me, things I had heard people speak of without ever even beginning to think they might effect my life in any way.  As it turns out, this actually could have taken place without me having to bother my pretty little head about such details, if only I'd bothered to pay attention to some other details.   ********note to self: scroll down the page before assuming all available options are listed within plain sight******** I managed to find a web site offering free site counters with no trouble at all, and proceeded to follow their directions to get set up, so far so good.  At this point I'm practically patting myself on the back, sure that all of my computer problems are behind me.  Then I get the  part with the HTML and java script options, at first I'm stymied, but I don't let my ignorance slow me down for long, I plod along until I finally find a page with all sorts of stuff I don't understand on it "Ah-ha, this must be it" I cut and paste the more complicated one first, undaunted by the warnings that it might not work, I hit preview, and almost start jumping up and down with glee again (I restrained myself however, I do want to keep my job) there at the bottom of the screen was a lovely little site counter.  So I hit submit and republish, and all that jazz, then I look and it's not there, "what the ....." So I do it again, with the same results.  At this point I'm still figuring it's just one of those things, and if I could just get someone else to hit the submit button for me it would work perfectly.  I go back and find the simpler option, and repeat, and repeat, and repeat.  Learning from my mistakes isn't one of my stronger points but eventually even I had to figure I must've done something wrong somewhere along the way.  I start over, and right off I figure it out (someone give the girl a prize) I picked the wrong section, there's a special blog area cleverly hidden out of sight on one of the first pages (see note to self)  By now I'm feeling a little less impressed with my computer abilities, but at least I figured it out.  After filling it out I get a happy little message saying it was completed successfully, but then it wouldn't let me use a code, 'cause I'd already used it with the first one, and by then it was time to go home, and I could have jumped up and down with glee cause there wasn't anyone else around, but there was nothing to be gleeful about. But wonder of wonders, miracle of miracles, I log on this morning and there it is, and it's working, so naturally I have to change the way it looks, and carefully examine all possible options, messing with as many of them as possible.  It's probably broken again, but I haven't had the heart to look.

      After the Comedy Sportz workshop tonight I went out to Karaoke with a couple of friends at a little hole-in-the-wall Irish pub, I sang my very first solo karaoke song ("like a virgin" how appropo) I also did an old stand by duo with Joseph, "I'm on fire" but my mike was turned off, so really I just stood there.   I'm a regular at Karaoke night at our local "gay friendly" bar, but this was a different kind of experience.  The drunk factor, and the hick factor were both a little higher but the only people I knew there were good enough friends that I knew they would tell me I was great even if I wasn't. (your really good friends will always lie to you about this sort of thing)  All and all I'm glad I went, it was good for me to get up there all by myself, safety-netless, someday I'll get around to conquering my fear of the lime light, and this may well have been a good first step.  The really exciting news is that some drunk guy who didn't know me told me I sounded just like Madonna, either he was lying, hoping that complementing me would be a good first step to get me in the sack, or he was drunk enough that peewee herman would've sounded like Madonna, but irregardless, it was nice to get the compliment.

          So I just started reading this book about Alfred Adler (I needed something to read, and we have a lending library at work, it was this or romance novels, I stand by my decision) for those of you who don't know he was a prominent psychologist in the early 20th century, once associated with Freud and Young, but I digress.       I've only made it as far as the preface right now, but I came across this little table, detailing characteristics of tough minded and tender minded temperments, I was a bit dismayed to find that I actually seem to be the tender minded sort.  I won't bore you with the entire thing, but the one that really got to me was the idealist vs materialist.       You see, I've always had this thing against materialism, don't get me wrong, I love having things, I even love buying things, but I don't love things, and I don't think the acquisition of things should ever be the focus of one's life.  You know what they say about the love of money being the root of all evil (no, what do they say?)  My Daddy was big on accumulation,  I'm one of 9 kids, he was married to 9 different women, we had 30 cats 20 peacocks, 35 chickens, and an old English sheep dog (the dog was mine) when I was a kid.  He wasn't so much into the traditional sort of materialism, he didn't need to have the nicest car, house, TV and such, but he had to have the most of everything.     On the other hand, I have a lot of respect for idealists, my mama is this great hippie lady, she does all sorts of work in the community trying to educate people on environmentalism, sexism, racism, and all sorts of political stuff.  I don't always agree with her sentiments, but I love the fact that she believes she can make a difference,  that people are innately good and that all the world needs is people who are willing to do their part to make their ideals a reality.     I wish I was more like my mama, I wish I had a cause I cared enough about to really put my heart into it.  I wish I believed I can make a difference (but hell, I can't even make dinner with any regularity.) Check it out, 3 pages into the preface of a psych textbook and I'm all introspective and stuff, maybe I should've grabbed a romance novel after all.

      It's kinda sad, here it is Friday, and I'm not going to CSZ tonight.&nbsp; The&nbsp;Friday night&nbsp;shows have become a regular part of my weekly schedule, and I'm gonna miss them.   Tonight I'm going out&nbsp;with my best friend.&nbsp; I love her to death, but I'm not too sure about her taste in drinking and dancing establishments.&nbsp; She wants to go to a number of different places tonight, to "strut our stuff." (I'm not making that up, she's always saying stuff like that) I know Tsunami is on the list of places to visit, I've never been, and&nbsp;had been planning on remaining&nbsp;in the dark about the wonders found within that lovely little meat-market, but it seems my blissful ignorance is destined to end tonight.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe I'll have a good time, but it seems more likely that I'll spend the majority of the evening fending off very drunk frat boys, and trying to keep Amy out of trouble.&nbsp; But at the very least, I should have a funny story or two for ya'll tomorrow

      Went out to Karaoke at Mulligan's&nbsp;after workshop last night, with Aaron, Adam, Angie, Joseph, and Russell, and, surprisingly, had a really good time.&nbsp; I had only planned on staying for an hour or so, but didn't end up leaving until a little after 1, and I would have stayed longer, if I hadn't had to go to work today.&nbsp; towards the end of the night we pretty much had the bar to ourselves, and I even sang, (sort of) twice, "Strawberry wine" by Deanna Carter, and "Manic Monday" by the Bangles.&nbsp; Did a pretty bad job on both, but it was fun.&nbsp;

       There were a number of little hoops I had to jump through, in order to go to college.&nbsp; My favorite was having to go to both the teacher and the department head for every class I took and having them sign a stupid little form before I could register.&nbsp; This was annoying on a lot of levels.&nbsp; First of all, it was kind of insulting, I had to go up to these teachers and say, "Hi, my name is That Girl, I'm (12-15) and I'd love to take your class, please sign this stupid little form" now if that was all I had to do, it wouldn't have been so bad, but no, they all wanted to  talk  to me.&nbsp; They wanted to know how I was doing, was the stress of being a college student at such a young age wearing on me, (no, but the stress of having to listen to all these people ask the same questions in the same patronizing tone was) and they all wanted me to know they'd be there for me if I needed someone to talk to.&nbsp; There were variations on this theme, of course, all the teachers in the social science department covertly tried to get good gossip on my Daddy,&nbsp; and for some reason or another the guy who was the head of the mathematics department the first year I was there refused to see me at all, luckily his liked me.   Now the first term this wasn't so bad, but as I started taking more and more credits, this process became more and more annoying.&nbsp; You see, I had to have back up plans, in case I was unable to get my first schedule choice, and I had to get these things signed  before  I could try to register for the classes, one term I think I had 30 or so of them to fill out, and I had to get this done the week before finals week, when I had too much crap to do anyways.&nbsp; Grrrrrr...&nbsp; At least the teachers were usually easy enough to find, the department heads, on the other hand, I had to make an appointment to see, an appointment that they almost invariably broke, rescheduled, broke again, and then eventually signed the darned forms when I tracked them down in the cafeteria.  Then there were the actual classes, having skipped middle and high school,&nbsp;I had a lot of catching up to do in a&nbsp;number of different areas.&nbsp; I took a lot of really basic classes, learning how to type, writing skills, (all of which I've either forgotten, or choose to ignore) and computer science. (basic computer science is possibly the least useful class ever, I actually had to learn to count in binary and hexadecimal, skills that have yet to prove themselves useful)&nbsp; I also took all the social science classes I could get my hands on, Psychology, Sociology, History, Neural Linguistics Programming.&nbsp; I stayed away from the "real" sciences, Daddy was afraid I wouldn't do well, since I didn't have any science background to speak of.  I&nbsp; wanted to take "fun" classes so bad, but Daddy said that would be "a waste of an opportunity" so I was allowed to take piano, and music fundamentals, (this was the kind of compromise my Daddy was famous for, you see, I didn't want to take either of these) but no singing, acting, art or (god forbid)&nbsp;dance classes.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically Daddy wanted to ensure that I kept my 4.0 GPA, and he wasn't confident that I would excel in the arts.  I know everybody feels like they were under oodles of pressure as a teenager, and while my story isn't exactly normal, that part definitely is.&nbsp; I still went through the typical gambit of teenage emotions,&nbsp; the desire to please and impress your parents, coupled with the fierce determination to be your own person, and all of the intriguing identity crisis that go along with it.&nbsp; Good enough was never good enough for Daddy, nor was he a "just do your best, honey" kind of guy, he was more of a "my way or the highway" (a quote he was always quick to interject) sort, and his way was perfect.&nbsp; I grew up hearing encouraging words like "if you can't do it right, don't do it at all."&nbsp; One experience sort of symbolizes&nbsp;my relationship with him during those last couple of years I lived with him; &nbsp;I had just found out what my final percentage in math 111 was, and I was very excited to report that I had finished the class with a 104% average, (I had done a few extra credit assignments, and had gotten all of the bonus questions on the tests correct) now I should have known better,&nbsp;but I was expecting an excited "good job" or something of the sort, but instead he calmly replied, why didn't you get 106%?&nbsp; You see, Daddy believed that I would rise to his expectations, and rise&nbsp;I did, right up until I didn't.  Another great lesson I learned during that time frame:&nbsp; Nobody likes a smart girl.&nbsp; My darling father, with the best of intentions, I'm sure, sat me down one day, and said "sweetie, the day is going to come when you start being interested in boys, and I just want you to know, they're going to be intimidated by you, if you don't tone down your intelligence"&nbsp; he went on to tell me that I should let them win, if we played games,&nbsp;be careful not to use words they wouldn't understand, and never, ever, under any circumstances let them know that I was going to college.&nbsp; Now the truth of the matter is, sadly, this isn't bad advice.&nbsp; I can't tell you how many guys quit calling after the first time we played Scrabble.&nbsp; (Scrabble is my favorite board game, but it's a tricky one, cause not only do you get to kick their ass, but you also get to show them you have a good&nbsp;vocabulary) &nbsp;And until very, very recently when people asked me where I went to high school, I still responded "I didn't" or (my favorite) "I didn't go to high school around here" without elaborating further.&nbsp;

      Had a kinda strange night at Karaoke last night, I felt more like an observer than a participant, been feeling like that quite a bit lately actually.&nbsp; Feeling lonely even when I'm not alone.&nbsp; The last couple of times I've gone out to 80's night and Karaoke I haven't really wanted to go, but I want to be alone even less.&nbsp; It's so strange, less than a month ago I would have given anything to get to spend a night home by myself, but now that I can, I don't want to.&nbsp; Alright, enough of my whining.   Had some folks over for dinner tonight, it was nice.&nbsp; I made my world famous (it's a small world, after all) spaghetti, we ate, I drank, it was merry.&nbsp; I might have to learn how to cook a couple of other things, I really like having people over for dinner, but it would be nice if I could mix it up a little.&nbsp;   I guess I'm not feeling too talkative tonight, who'd have thought it was possible?

      Bast is my cat.&nbsp; She's a good enough cat I guess, but I really don't like her name, it wasn't my idea, she's named after the Egyptian cat goddess, Bastat, and the way she acts sometimes you'd think she knows it.&nbsp; I'm considering re-naming her, although it seems kinda pointless, as I just call her kitty, and would likely continue&nbsp;calling&nbsp;her kitty, regardless of her actual name.&nbsp; I'm too lazy to call&nbsp;animals by their names.&nbsp; (People too, for that matter, I'm forever referring to people as honey, sweetie, or something equally&nbsp;annoying [but cute!])   I was worried sick about the little brat on Saturday,&nbsp;when&nbsp;I went over to the house to start on the&nbsp;cleaning,&nbsp;and to help Shane pack, she was nowhere be found.&nbsp; I checked all her normal hiding spots, (I even opened the doors to all the closets, she has this annoying tendency to run in when someone opens the door, one time she was locked in the guest bedroom closet for almost 24 hours)&nbsp;I was kind of frantic about it by the time I left, she's declawed, and practically debrained too, (if brains were dynamite she wouldn't have enough to blow her cute&nbsp;little kitty nose) she's never been outside, and my house is right next to a rather busy street where cat corpses are all too familiar, and Shane has been moving, which means open unattended doors, scary business.&nbsp; It's not as if I actually like the stupid mammal, but I sure was worried.&nbsp;  I think I figured out where she'd been hiding&nbsp;though, yesterday I found her curled up behind the toilet in my bathroom,&nbsp;now why didn't I think to look there?&nbsp; I swear I looked everywhere else in the house (including the kitchen cabinets&nbsp;and the fridge) how could I have missed that little cranny behind the toilet?  Anyway, I'm glad she didn't get run over by a car, but I really wish she'd find a better place to hang out.   &nbsp;

      Spent the day cleaning and rearranging my house, with the help of some VERY cool people.&nbsp; Thank you all so much, I can't even begin to tell you how much I appreciate&nbsp;your help.&nbsp; So many people have been there for me during this difficult period in my life, and I just don't have words to express how much you all mean to me.&nbsp; Hopefully I'll stop being such a pain the ass soon.   For the benefit of those of you who have never seen my house, I have 3 bedrooms,&nbsp;until today they had served as bedroom,&nbsp;office, and&nbsp;guest bedroom.&nbsp; I cleaned the bedroom yesterday (not the master bath though, it still looks like it was the victim of a small, but viciously determined, tornado) and we actually managed to empty the office today.&nbsp; (this pleases me greatly, but then, I'm easily amused)&nbsp; The guest bedroom is gonna be a little trickier.&nbsp; I called it the guest bedroom, but really it was  my  bedroom.&nbsp; This was where I kept all of my assorted crap, (I'm a bit of a packrat, it's a problem) I managed to get some of it moved around today, but sadly, I think I'm gonna have to just get rid of some stuff.&nbsp; I'm just too darned sentimental, I'm fairly incapable of parting with anything of sentimental value, and EVERYTHING in that room has sentimental value.&nbsp; Really, most of it's not even mildly important stuff, I mean, I don't really &nbsp;need  that cookie tin that my neighbor when&nbsp;I was 14 gave me do I?&nbsp; Do I??&nbsp; And my very first keyboard, (a little casio that, at last try didn't even work anymore [and even if it did, I wouldn't play {and even if I would, the darned thing doesn't have enough keys on it to play the majority of the stuff I might try to pick out}]) there's no good reason for it to be taking up space anywhere but a landfill, but can I part with it?&nbsp;  NO , no way, not a chance, I mean....It was my first keyboard, that thing has memories coming out the...Speakers?&nbsp;&nbsp; Speaking of speakers, I've got this lovely little set (the set is little, only 2 of them, not the speakers themselves) that's only about 20 years old, I don't even know how to hook the darned things up, but my Daddy gave them too me, and if you stick a sarong over them, they make a lovely little table.&nbsp; You see my dilemma. &nbsp;(ok, you probably don't, if you're even remotely sane, chances are you think I'm at least slightly demented for keeping that crap for this long)   The living room is looking pretty good though, if you can ignore the fact that there's a dead plant on the entertainment center where a TV would normally be located, and that the coffee table is just sitting, lonely, in the middle of the room, without the aid of&nbsp;a couch to balance out the feng shui.&nbsp; And I can.&nbsp; In fact I'm pretty pleased with how well it's&nbsp;going, all and all, it almost feels like home again.   I'm still not used to being alone in the house, it feels kinda eerie,&nbsp;if all goes well&nbsp;it won't be an issue for long, as I hope to have roommates soon, but in the meantime it's just kinda weird.&nbsp;

       I like to go back and forth about my Daddy, I love him, no doubt about that, but he was far from perfect, and that's kinda tough for me to reconcile. In my life he plays the role of both super-hero and villain. Today he gets to be a villain. Just so you know, though, I can talk shit about him, you can't. I've heard a lot of people say things about him that were less than complementary, and regardless of whether or not what they're saying is true, it still both hurts and angers me. That said:   My Daddy was a bit of a ladies man, he did his best to hide it from me when I was little, and me being a little on the slow side, he mostly succeeded. By the time I was 13 or so I figured out that all those "naps" he took with Eva, Suzie, Renee, Jeanie, Susan, Pam, and the rest of his "friends" (Daddy didn't ever have any of his male friends over, in fact, the only men I can remember coming to our house were the husbands of the women he was sleeping with, how uncomfortable!) probably didn't involve a whole lot of sleeping. But by then, he was married again, so all of his extracurricular activities had to be done outside of the house anyway.  As far as I know, he met all of his girlfriends at school; most of them were students who had come to him for counseling. In his defense, he was a single father, and he didn't really have a social life to speak of, so that was pretty much his only opportunity to meet women, but still, he was their COUNSELOR, and it's just bad form to seduce troubled young women who come to you for help.  He had charisma coming out his ears, I don't really see that he was that attractive, at least by the time I was born, but what he lacked in brawn, he made up for in brains, and all these poor tortured souls who came to him, asking for advise on their love lives just ate that shit up. He'd counsel them for a month or so, and then he'd start inviting them to go places with us on the weekends. Nothing special, if they had kids of their own, we'd all go to the park, or go out for pizza at one of the places with a playground, otherwise we'd just go out for lunch, or feed the ducks. They were all really nice to me too, at least at first. I'm not sure what gene makes women go gaga over the children of the man they're involved with, but it's definitely ingrained. After a couple of weekend outings I always started getting little presents, books mostly, although a few of them tried to buy me little dresses (I didn't really start wearing dresses until I was a teenager, I was a bit of a tom-boy, and it's really hard to climb a tree in a dress) and one (she didn't last very long) bought me a Barbie, I don't even remember her name, but I remember that stupid doll, I was about 8, and it was my first Barbie, I just couldn't figure out what the appeal was, in fact I still don't get it....Anybody know what you're supposed to DO with Barbie’s???  Generally a few weeks after the presents started, the girls started coming over, if they were single there were sleepovers, the married ones just took naps. The amazing thing to me is that I never questioned that as a kid, it was normal to me, and I never even considered the idea that something more could be going on. I did know that the naps especially weren't to be talked about, and I was even given cover stories to relate to the husbands in the event I was questioned, (it's not lying if you repeat what your Daddy told you to say, it's just not) usually the cover story involved me, like they were teaching me how to knit, giving me piano lessons, and my personal favorite, tutoring me in math (I was better at math by the time I was 8 or 9 than at least half of the girls Daddy dated, and occasionally, just to keep up appearances they would actually try to teach me something, I was under strict orders not to embarrass them)  For the most part I saw these girls as temporary distractions, I knew they wouldn't last, they never did, but occasionally, I would really hit it off with one of them, and that always made the break-ups hard. One in particular hung around for the longest time, and then kept coming back every year or so, until Renee (that's the evil step-mother, of all the girls, why'd he have to marry that bitch????) finally threatened divorce if she wasn't declared persona non grata. Her name was Suzie, and she was a real sweetheart most of the time. She got a little crazy when it came to Daddy though, I guess she was really in love, bless her heart. Daddy broke up with her for the umpteenth time when he started seeing Renee seriously (Renee was still married at this point, but what're you gonna do?) They had a HUGE fight, that led to Daddy being hospitalized, (he had 3 heart attacks that day, we didn't have a phone, and I had to run down to the neighbors house to call an ambulance, all the while, Suzie was still screaming) I remember Suzie coming into my room, in the middle of the night, and trying to explain to me that she loved me, but wasn't going to get to see me anymore. I'd heard it before, but then she started talking trash, I remember her saying, "you know how your father can be" and for some reason that just set me off. I was fiercely protective of him, I'd been listening to her scream at him ad nauseum for hours, and I'd begged her to stop yelling when he'd been laying there, almost dying. I told her I never wanted to see her again. Strangely enough, she's actually the only one of the women in his life that I still keep in contact with, but I've still never quite forgiven her for that day.   OK I don't have a neat ending for this post, but I think I'm done now.  &nbsp;

      Well, if all goes as planned, it looks like I'm moving back into my house this weekend.  I'm currently trying to recruit help with cleaning and moving furniture and stuff.  If you don't have anything better to do on Sunday you're more than welcome to come over and lend a hand, or just hang out in the air-conditioning and make snide remarks.  The house is a pigsty right now, and will probably get worse over the next couple of days.  Normally I don't let people come over when it's messy, but since this isn't really my mess, and I'd really like some company, I'm making an exception.

      I’ve developed this new and annoying habit of waking up early on days when I don’t have to work.  Good old Murphy.  Four days a week I have to be awake at the very reasonable hour of 9am, for some reason this tends to be problematic.  9 rolls around, and I’m still tired, I feel like I could continue sleeping for hours.  Yesterday I woke up at 10 minutes to 8, and I was wide-awake, ready to face the day, bright eyed and bushy tailed, rearing to go…  You get the idea.  A couple of cups of coffee later I was feeling a wee bit less awake, and unaccountably hungry.  This was strange as I don’t make a habit of eating in the morning, usually I don’t get hungry before 2 or so, but there’s an exception to every rule, and yesterday was nothing if not exceptional.  I tried drinking another cup of coffee, hoping that if I filled up on empty calories I could avoid actually having to find something to eat, but all that did was leave me feeling jittery AND hungry. July 17th would have been my Daddy’s 77th birthday; I tried really hard to forget it this year, but only managed to postpone dealing with it for a few days.  When I wallow, I like to do it right, so I headed out to GJ’s, a greasy spoon we frequented in the last few years of his life, which also holds the distinction of being the restaurant we had breakfast at on the morning he died.  I gave Aaron a call on the way over, and he joined me, it’s a little harder to get properly morose with him around, but I’m not complaining.  (For a change)  ************************************************  Had a bit of a shock in the afternoon, when my ex (not really sure what to call him now, guess that works as good as anything) threw a bit of a tantrum (I want to apologize to those of you who were there, I wish you hadn’t had to see & hear that) and then followed it up with more angry messages to add to my voicemail collection.  For a minute there I was actually afraid of him, not a fun feeling.  In his defense, I did put him in a bad situation, and he had every right to be angry. He called today to apologize, and wants to see me tonight after workshop, I agreed to call and talk to him, but I won’t go over there by myself right now, I’m afraid to.  I saw a part of him yesterday that I didn’t know was there, and I don’t know how to deal with it.   It’s tearing me up inside.  I mean, I married this guy, I lived with him for years, and he’s the only man I’ve been with in my adult life.  I thought I knew him, and now I’m afraid to be alone with him?  What the heck is up with that?  And if I really do have a right to be scared, and I’m not just overreacting to a stressful situation, then what the hell is wrong with me that I could have put myself in that situation for so long?  Am I beating myself up too much over all this crap, or not enough?    ***************************************************  Watched two movies yesterday, both of which were highly enjoyable, but in totally different ways.  Saw “Mean Girls” with Aaron and Lillith at the $1.50 theater, a bargain at twice the price.  Lots of cute girls doing stupid things, but with a moral at the end of the story.  Shortly thereafter the 3 of us went over to Jesse’s house to watch Donny Darco, probably the best movie I’ve seen this year.  (Although my taste in movies tends to be sophomoric at best, so take all my movie advice with a grain of salt, it’s just one girl’s opinion)    ****************************************************  Finally got around to hanging out with an old friend, and former paramour I’ll call Joe (So I can say potentially embarrassing things about him with immunity) last night.  We had a couple of drinks, played a couple games of pool, and he tried to get me to sleep with him.  I’m soooooo out of practice at this.  Nobody tries to get me in the sack anymore.  I mean, I’m a flirt by nature, (when I’m not being a bitch that is) but this wasn’t flirting, this was serious.  Honestly it was kinda nice, haven’t been feeling too desirable lately, (it seems as though all of my male friends these days like me for my personality, and as hard as it is to bitch about that, damn it, every now and then a I need to hang out with a guy who’d just as soon screw me as talk to me) and Joe said all the right things, while still managing to keep his hands to himself.  If I was gonna screw around right now, he’d be the intelligent choice.  I’ve known him forever, I know it wouldn’t screw up our friendship, if memory serves he was more than competent between the sheets, and I never had to remind him to put a sock on it.  So why didn’t I have myself a little fun?  I don’t know why, and it kinda pisses me off.  I do know it’s not gonna happen, next time I see him I’ll tell him to lay off the funny stuff, and not only will he give it a rest, but he won’t even stop wanting to hang out with me.  He’s that kind of a guy.

         Got up early on Sunday to go to Springfield's newest star attraction, an event that made the front page of our Pulitzer prize winning newspaper, yes folks I'm speaking of none other than a swap meet. Turns out it was just a parking lot with 3, count them, 3 booths, not nearly as exciting as I had hoped, but it all worked out in the end, cause we (Aaron, Russell, and I) went garage saling.  I've always been a fan of thrift stores, and I've always wanted to check out the garage sale scene, but other than checking out sales I happened to be walking by (back in the pre-car days, when I actually used my legs as a form of transportation) I'd never before had any real garage sale experience. I'd been missing out.   Now, it's not as though I actually came out with anything particularly necessary, basically I got a bunch of stuff I can (and had been, quite successfully I might add) live with out, but I got it all cheap!!  Free is my favorite price, but cheap comes a real close second.  I'm a bargain hunter by nature, thrift and outlet stores gently call my name, sweetly inviting me to come in and spend money I don't have on things I don't need. Normally I'm a rather frugal person, content to live within my means, not particularly inclined to follow the American tradition of  buy, buy, buy , but show me a good deal, (especially a one time only, not gonna be here tomorrow, if you don't buy it now you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life, forever remembering this moment when you had the chance, but were too darned cheap to spend 25 frickin' cents on this amazing item, deal) and all bets are off. And now a whole new realm of untapped bargains has opened up before me, frankly, I'm terrified.  This is scary stuff, I already have a hard enough time supporting my Goodwill habit, (and in the spirit of honesty, there's the Grocery outlet, and Factory 2 U habits to account for as well... "But it's such a good deal! Really, when you think about it, I'm SAVING money in the long run")  I may have to get a second job to facilitate a garage sale budget.   For the record, my purchases included, 5 books (two were compilations of children’s literature, too bad I don't have any kids [but when I do have kids, that'll be one less thing to buy! {See, this is how my addled little brain works, this is a prime example of why I shouldn't be allowed with 100 yards of a good deal, cause SOMEDAY I'm gonna need EVERYTHING, might as well save myself time and money, by just picking it all up now while it's on sale}]) For a total of $1.25, a snakeskin print shirt that I'll prolly never wear, for $2, a badminton set (I don't even play badminton, but now I'll have to learn, and it'll be good for me, I'll get some exercise, yeah right) for $2.50, 2 adorable little black purses (in my defense, I've actually been looking for a new little black purse, I only had one, and it was hard to get into, and not quite big enough for all the crap I feel it's imperative that I carry with me at all times [of course I bought 2, cause, well, you know, they were a good deal]) for $1.50 each, a set of 2 angel bells (one of which I wore around my neck last night on a dare, thereby earning back the purchase price of both) for free, (after rebate) a corkscrew for .50, a doily for .25, (it's really pretty, and lets face it, a girl can never have too many doilies)  a couple of board games, the prices already forgotten, and a set of 5 little tiny glasses, (made for brandy or sherry I imagine, one of those after dinner drinks that I don't drink, but they look just like little wine glasses, and they're about shot sized, and well, I just couldn't live without them) for $1.

      As those of you who have been paying attention know, my Daddy was a psychology teacher at the local Community college.  He did free counseling for his students, which left me with oodles of time to run amok around the social science department, harassing the students and conning the secretaries out of cookies and candy.  (This is very easy to do, as secretaries love to spoil little girls)  I also spent quite a bit of time annoying my Daddy's colleagues.  If he had a particularly busy afternoon (a fairly regular occurrence) I would run around and chat with any of the teachers who would tolerate me.  A number of them had a large impact on my life, but none more than Marv Jaegers.  Mr. Jaegers ("call me Marv" "yes Mr. Jaegers") only worked part-time, but his office was on the way to the bathroom and the social science office (this is where the cookie and candy conning took place) so I saw quite a bit of him.  He taught readings in American and European history classes, basically his students had to read a number of historical novels, (3 per credit, if I remember correctly) and then pass an oral exam about them.  Not exactly rocket science.    So one fine spring day when I was twelve (goodness it's hard to believe I was ever that young, I hardly even had breasts back then, inconceivable!) I stopped by his office and asked if I could borrow a book, (I've been an avid reader since I was about six, I had run out of books to read, and Daddy was too cheap to get me a library card [it's a good thing too, if I'd had a library card I probably would never have left the house, except to go to the library, of course]) Mr. Jaegers was, naturally, only too happy to lend me a book, I don't even recall the title, but I do remember enjoying it. (It had a couple of kinda steamy scenes, and for a pubescent girl it doesn't get much better than that)  I started reading it right away, and didn't really put it down until the following afternoon, when I finished it and returned it to Mr. Jaegers.   Now, if office gossip wasn't what it is, that might be the end of the story, but alas, even seemingly intelligent, educated, professionals fall prey to the temptation to spread rumors, and Mr. Jaegers didn't believe that a twelve year old little girl had finished a 600+ page book in under 24 hours, and he wasted no time in telling anyone who would listen that Mr. Lindsay's little angel had borrowed a book from him, and returned it the next day claiming that she had finished it.  ("She always seemed like such a sweet little girl, we never thought she'd be such a little liar")  This rumor spread like wildfire throughout the department, quickly making it back to my Daddy, and the following day on the drive home Daddy asked me if I'd actually read the book in it's entirety.  I was shocked that he'd ask such a thing; of course I'd read it, why on earth wouldn't I?  Additionally, he's the one who came into my room at 1 am and made me put the darned thing down so I could get some sleep.  (You have to realize that up until this point, the majority of the books I'd read had been written for children or teens, this was my first real experience with an adult novel, and I ate it up, it actually had a plot!  And sex! (Not any real sex, mind, just some kissing and a wee bit of groping, but I was twelve, it gave me warm funny feelings in my special place [Iowa]) And a few words that I actually had to consult my dictionary to understand! [I must've been the weirdest kid ever, I got some sort of sick thrill out of learning new words, though you wouldn't know it now, listening to me talk {"like, oh my god, did you like, see that guy?  He's so like, cute!! Ooh and I love those pants, they're soooo like, cool and stuff."}])  So, Daddy being the prideful man that he was, asked me if I would let Mr. Jaegers test me on the book as he would a student, and me, being the somewhat precocious, terribly self-conscious (and kind of wounded at this point too, I really couldn't believe that Mr. Jaegers could think I'd lied to him, I thought of him as a friend) girl that I was, naturally agreed.    (Now I'm gonna talk about something else for awhile, just cause I know the suspense is killing you, this is a real edge-of-your-seat kind of story isn't it, heck, I know what happens, and I can't wait to get to the end [alright, now that those of you who were undecided on whether or not I'm completely nuts or not know the truth, we'll get back to the story])  They set the "test" up for the following Monday, after I got out of school.  I gotta say I was pretty nervous, not only was it my first oral exam, but we're talking about a college level test here; I expected it to be difficult.  I'd never really been tested on my reading before either, and I hadn't been reading for retention, just for enjoyment.  But of course I did fabulously, scoring 100% and eliciting an apology from Mr. Jaegers, and a load of pats on the back from the rest of the faculty (most of whom "never doubted me for a moment," everybody’s always on your side, once you've proven yourself right)  This gave Daddy an idea, he decided at this point that I should just start going to college, and he set about making that dream a reality.  Over the course of the summer he had me take 3 of Mr. Jaeger's classes (without registering for them, as I wasn't a student yet) and he started lobbying to get me registered as a student.  He got Mr. Jaeger's, Mr. Delf (another History teacher) and Mr. Klobas (I later took NLP classes from Klobas, he was fond of saying things like "I oughta divorce you before I marry you, and where would you find another one like me?" and "if I was only half a century younger, you'd be in trouble") to write letters on my behalf, and he made me jump through all sorts of hoops, take all sorts of tests, and meet with oodles of "important" people.  By Fall, at the tender age of 12(and a half) I was a full fledged college student, although, despite the fact that I was going to college full time, I still went to Elementary school 2 days a week for the first two terms.  (Talk about opposite ends of the spectrum, I can't even begin to describe how strange it was to go back and forth between those two worlds, Monday, Wednesday and Friday I was a college student, while on Tuesday and Thursday, I still had recess twice a day)

      Had a great Comedysportz workshop last night! We did another mock show, and I didn't feel as though I was a deer caught in the headlights the entire time.  The fact that we had an audience of 1 probably didn't hurt, hard to get any serious stage fright when there's only 1 set of eyes on you, (and a non-threatening set at that) but still I felt pretty good about it all and all.   I even had to sing twice (who's fault was that anyway?? grrrr [I'm fierce!!!]) and it wasn't too abysmal. (truth be told I'm actually kinda proud of the spagettios song) I still couldn't do an accent to save my life, (good thing that's never gonna be an issue, huh?  Just imagine it for a moment, a dark dungeonesque room, a nondescript figure, [dressed entirely in black of course] harshly whispering "speak as if you are from France, if you value your life" yeah, that's gonna happen) my terrible, horrible, no good, very bad attempt at french came out sounding more like er...well...who knows what the heck it sounded like, but it certainly wasn't anything even remotely resembling french. (the most embarassing part of this is that I actually used to be able to do a french accent, years ago, not a good one mind you, but still....) I even took a couple of terms of french in college (maybe I should have spent a little more of that study time actually learning something, and a little less kissing my "tutor") if there was an accent I could do, this would be it, oh bother. Alrighty, I promised ya'll something inane, and boy did I deliver, the good news is I managed to use the word "dungeonesque" in a sentence, you don't get to do that every day. (or at least I don't, and I'm OK with that.  If you somehow manage to use the word  "dungeonesque" in a sentence every day, just going about your business as usual, you might want to re-examine your lifestyle choices, I just don't see how that could be healthy)

      Well, Sunday night/Monday morning my estranged husband tried to take his own life.   I don't know how seriously he tried, not sure if it was an attempt to get me back, a desperate cry for help or a real desire to end his life.  In any event it hurt me more than it hurt him.  I was a teenager once (not so very long ago) I remember having suicidal thoughts, but I can't imagine actually tring to go through with it.  I can't imagine life seeming that bleak at this point.  Additionally I don't understand how someone could put their friends and family through something like that.   I lost my Daddy (to natural causes) when I was seventeen, I know how much it hurts to lose a loved one to death, what on earth could inspire someone to intentionally put their loved ones through that ?  Alright, next time I post I'll have something amusing and inane to say, I promise.

      Had a good time at 80's night last night, I didn't have to drive so I was able to drink just a wee bit too much, a drunk girl is a happy girl.  Add to that the fact that I didn't feel guilty about being out in the first place and you have a recipe for giddiness.  I realized this morning that it's Friday (my grasp on the obvious is keen) and I'm okay with that.  I'm actually kinda looking forward to the weekend.  I almost feel like a normal person. (I must be losing it, I'm a lot of things, but normal isn't one of them)  For those of you who are concerned, I'm actually doing pretty darn good, all and all.  Really.  (I'm not even lying too much) It's been kind of amazing that so many people seem to genuinely care about me, it's boggling, just goes to show there's no accounting for taste.  It almost makes me wish I wasn't so  bitchy all the time.  (almost, but not quite)  I still haven't called my Mama, if you're reading this I'm sorry, I'll call you soon.  I promise.  I love you. (and if you're not reading this, what kind of a mother are you???)   Cyrena and Adam are the coolest people ever.  Ever.  (and at the risk of repeating myself) Ever.  They're so cool I don't even have anything bitchy to add here.  That's pretty damn cool.  Sambo has added me to his links page, I'm flattered, thanks.  I'm in the process of tackling his blog from the ground up, it's well worth the time spent reading.  I recently finished doing the same thing with Durden's  blog, also highly recommended by those who matter (namely me) If I was cool enough to do the whole link thingy I would, but alas, I'm not that cool, but you can find Sam at: sambos.blogspot.com and Durden at redsockdiaries.blogspot.com although actually I think just about everyone who reads this reads both of theirs anyway, or got here from Aaron's site (jamison.o-f.com) where there are real live links to both of them.  Eh, what're you gonna do?

      Nothing really interesting to say today, but I figure I gotta say something, since people are actually reading this blather, and I know how much it annoys me when other people don't update their blogs, but that's prolly just because I'm a nosy little.....Girl.  I work in a call center, all and all it's a pretty good job, I get to play on the computer half the day, my supervisor is a saint (you'd have to be to put up with me) and it turns out the nose picker guy is actually a pretty nice person.  The job would be perfect if it wasn't for all the customers.   We close at 7pm and I work the closing shift, so I'm stuck here until the queues are clear, and it always seems like I get the last call of the night right around 7:02.  Now, most of our calls last right around 2 minutes, but even 2 minutes seems like eternity at 7:02.  Yesterday my last call of the night came in at 7:01.  It seemed pretty cut and dry, a lady wanted to make sure her automatic draft had been set up, it had, this call should have lasted 30 seconds.  But (of course) she starts asking stupid questions, (how do I know it's gonna come out?  YOU DON'T!! Well, what if it doesn't? WE HUNT YOU DOWN AND KILL YOU!!)before long it's 7:06 and I'm being really, really, really, really nice, because I want to kill her.  After about the 17th "is there anything else I can do for you?" she finally says no, and as she's hanging up the phone I hear her say "for crying out loud, could she take any more perky pills?"  You just can't be nice to some people.

      Wow, it's been quite a week.    Monday I got a shove in the right direction from Aaron, Lillith, and Amber. I told a story that I won't tell here, it's not the sort of thing that can exist in black and white, but it was a story I needed to tell.  Sometimes I'm too damned proud for my own good, it kills me to ask for help, to ask for a shoulder to cry on.  Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart for listening and being there for me.   Yesterday morning I got up early and started packing, mostly just setimental stuff I can't live without, pictures, diaries, teddy bears, old notebooks with interesting doodles, you know, the essentials.  I boxed  all this crap up, put it in the trunk of my car intending to take it all over to my Mama's house for safekeeping.  I wasn't really planning on going anywhere just yet, but Tuesday is the only time I have the house to myself, and I wanted to be prepared.  I had a knot in my stomach all morning (more like all year, but it was worse yesterday than normal) I felt just like I always did as a kid when I was doing something wrong and I knew I was gonna get caught. (wait, I was a perfect child, I never did anything wrong...drat!)  I didn't get caught, I had all my assorted sentimental crap, along with a bunch of clothes and actual necessities packed away in the trunk of my car by the time he came home for lunch.  I think I had it in the back of my head all this time that I was just gonna leave for work one day and not come home at the end of the night.  I've been trying to get out of this marriage for awhile, but there was always one more reason to stay.  Mostly I just didn't want to hurt him and I don't do well with confrontation (I know this probably comes as a shock to those of you who I'm incessantly harassing, but it isn't confrontation if I don't mean it) I prefer to suffer in silence. (anybody have an opening for a martyr?  Anyone?)    Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. (people always say that, I had no idea how true it was)  When I walked out the door he was still begging me not to go, I wanted to turn around and tell him I was wrong, that it would be alright, we could work it out, I wanted to hold him and lie, just to make him stop, like I always do, but I'm so sick of lying, I wish all those things were true, I tried to lie to myself to make them true, but I know better.  I was bawling when I got into my car, I had to stop at the end of the street to get myself together enough to drive.  Who says you can't break a broken heart?  I didn't even know where I was going, my first thought was my Mama's house, but she does daycare, and it was right around nap-time, plus I didn't want to scare the little kids with all my hysterics.  So I went to the bar. (good idea huh?  Alcohol and depression, always a winning combination) It took me about half an hour to get up the nerve to call Cyrena, she told me recently that I could call her if I ever needed someone to talk to, and boy did I.  Bless her heart, she dropped everything to come let me cry on her shoulder, apologized for not getting there sooner, and then offered me a place to stay.  I must have done something really great in a past life to deserve a friend like her.  THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU  So, I don't know what I'm gonna do, or how it's all gonna work out, but I slept well last night for the first time in far too long, and I woke up this morning without a feeling of impending doom lingering over me.  And heck, I'm a girl, I believe in happy endings.

      Starting the winter I was 3, Daddy and I went skiing every Thursday of ski season.  He scheduled his classes so he had the day off, and I got to play hookie from school.  I don't even remember learning how to ski, I know I had to have learned, it isn't the sort of skill that comes naturally, but I guess I was just too young to remember. (probably a good thing, as I'm not terribly fond of falling down)   If you're going to go skiing weekdays are the time to go, no waiting in line, and if it's snowed lately, often there is still powder on the ground.  On the weekends the slopes get packed down due to high traffic, you can get going a little faster, but you don't have the same kind of control, and it hurts more if you fall.   It's been years since I've been skiing, we stopped our weekly trips when I started college, and I couldn't get away with skipping school anymore  (we also took a year off when Daddy had his first batch of heart attacks) the last time I went was with my church youth group when I was 13, but if I close my eyes real tight and imagine it, even standing here in my too-warm workplace (the air conditioner on my side of the building is broken, grrrr) I can still feel it.  The cold wind biting my face, the way my stomach would do a little flip-flop when I'd go over a jump, the rush of adrenaline when I got going too fast, and I knew I couldn't stop if my life depended on it.  Heck, even falling could be a rush if it was a good one, the kind where you roll end over end and then have to spend 15 minutes getting all your stuff back together, because your skis, poles, sunglasses, and hat are scattered every which way.   We started taking my step-brothers with us when I was about 10, and it was one of the few times when I didn't resent having them around.  You see, I was better at it then them.  I know that sounds awful, but it's true, I could and did ski circles around them, and it drove them crazy.   They were always a lot bigger than me, Matthew was 2 years older than me, Jesse 8 days younger (a fact I never let him forget) these days Matt is 6'2, Jesse 6'3 and both of them are well over 200 lbs, back then they weren't quite that big, but still just as physically intimidating to yours truly, and they didn't like me any more than I liked them. The good news is I can take a punch.  But put us on a mountain and I had the advantage.  I was faster, more agile, and by the time they started coming along I thought I was pretty much invincible on a pair of skis.   I continually tried to get them killed, and they fell for it every time. (pun intended)  I knew the paths between the slopes that had all the jumps, as well as all the trees (not a good combination) and I'd lead them to certain death by telling them they shouldn't follow me, they could get hurt.  I was right.  Matthew broke his arm twice, and his leg once, Jesse never broke anything, but had his fair share of sprains, and one concussion (I felt pretty bad about that one) I never got hurt skiing. In hindsight I probably would've gotten beat up a lot less off the mountain, if I hadn't baited them so much on it, but I think it was worth it.

      I grew up on a farm of sorts, 5 acres in a little town called Cheshire. (population 400)  As you know (if you're paying attention, and if you're not, shame on you) Daddy trained horses, so we had a number of them when I was a baby, but he quit when I was about 2 (this was about the same time he was getting a divorce from wife #8 [she had been one of his students, the marriage lasted under a year, she was 22 when the divorce went through]) and only kept 2 horses.  I never really learned how to ride, a fact that I'm still a little bitter about (who me? Bitter? Never!) I have 5 older sisters who are all champion riders, and I can't even get into a saddle without help, much less have any clue what I'm doing once I'm up there.  C'est la vie.  It's a different world, living in the country, I miss it sometimes, mostly just the little things.    We had well water, it tastes so much better to me than city water, or even filtered water, it had almost a sweet aftertaste, and no chemical tastes. (I taste chemicals in bottled water, I don't know if it's all in my head, or due to being bottled in plastic, or if the water bottlers are just lying about where they're getting it from, but I taste it)   It actually got dark at night.  No street lights to help you find your way, either you learn to get along with only the stars and the moon to guide you, or you grab a flashlight.  I have really good night vision, I attribute that to the fact that I didn't want to carry a flashlight. (even as a child I was contrary)  You can see a million times more stars at night without any lights to get in your way, when I look up in the sky now part of me always wonders what happened to all the stars.  Quiet means something different when you can't hear any cars.  I've often heard people say that it gets quieter at night in the country, but I disagree, it's just different.  The crickets are the most noticeable noise, for those who aren't used to them, but just as I now rarely notice the sound of cars going by, the crickets generally escaped my notice then.  I did notice when the raccoons were crawling under the house, and when there were deer eating the grass (and flowers, deer are pretty, but obnoxious) right outside my bedroom window.  I heard the occasional gunshot, often from miles away, because the sound carries so well without white noise to drown it out, there were catfights at least weekly, and more often during certain times of the year.  Our house had a tin roof, so there was never any wondering if it was raining outside, and there is nothing quite like waking up to the sound of a dozen peacocks and 1 rooster welcoming the dawn. (if you think that sounds pleasant, you've never heard a peacock)  The view was breathtaking.  I lived on a little hill, and from my front porch I could see miles of fields, trees, and hills, with only the occasional house, and only 1 road.  There was just so much space, I couldn't even see the houses of my neighbors.  I could walk for half a mile knowing I wouldn't see another person.  Strangely enough, the thing I miss the most is the drive, half an hour to get into town every day, that was a full hour each day that I had my daddies full attention.(technically I guess that's not true, as he did have to drive and all)  We did all sorts of things on those drives, I learned how to add, and how to multiply, I learned the inner workings of a combine and the reasons behind field burning. (I may be the only person alive who actually LOVES that smell)  We used to play this game, (it had a name but I've forgotten it) where Daddy would talk about a situation that was good, and I'd have to think of negative things that would come from it, and the other way around. (you win the lottery, you have to pay taxes, or you break your leg, giving hospital workers a job to do etc.)    Daddy had a couple of heart attacks and a stroke when I was 8, and for a couple of months I had to give him directions to my school every morning, and I wrote down directions for him to get to work and back to my school to pick me up.  As I got older we'd spend those car trips discussing books I'd read, or arguing about politics, but regardless of the topic of our conversation it was always our time together.

      I've got one of my no-good-very-bad-not-quite-a-migraine-cause-I-can-still-function-but-only-just-barely headaches. These are the worst kind, cause I still feel the need to leave the house and take care of my responsibilities, despite the fact that all I really want to do is curl up into a little ball, somewhere cool and dark. It started last night, intensified during my mechanical difficulties, and made it very difficult to sleep, so I'm tired and in pain, it's a fantastic combo for dealing with idiots all day. I'm currently debating the relative merits of going home sick, and taking a nap, and some tylenol. I'm inherently distrustful of, even over-the-counter, pain medication, it just doesn't seem right to me that you can take a little pill and feel better. I guess I have kinda hippie beliefs in this regard, but I feel like if you're in pain there's probably a reason for it, and treating the symptom may not be the best idea for all-over health (says the girl who lives predominately on a diet of ramen and taco-bell, [sure it's hypocritical, but you've gotta pick your battles, you know?]) mostly it probably all just boils down to laziness, going to the cabinet and grabbing some pills would be effort after all.

      Well I went out and purchased myself some new deadbolts tonight (Home Depot was closed, by the way, when did they start closing? The last time I wanted home improvement crap in the middle of the night they were there for me, I'm disappointed, and may stop going there altogether, it's just not the same now that it's not 24 hour) fully intending to just go ahead and install them myself this evening. Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. Once upon a time, I was good at this sort of thing, I could've just looked at all the pieces and then put them together, and gone about my life. Those days are no more, I fear. I had thought that my inaptitude was merely a technological issue, but it seems it's spread to mechanical objects as well. (to speak nothing of my social skills) 5 years ago I installed an entire doorknob (the house I was living in at the time, in the backyard of my Mama's house had no lock, and my roommate had just broken up with her boyfriend, and we'd been having issues not unlike my current circumstances [the more things change, the more they stay the same]) using only a Swiss army knife, and a butter knife. Mind you this may have been the most tedious process I have ever intentionally put myself through, but that was predominately due to the amount of whittling that had to be done. So naturally I figured, if I could manage that, a couple of deadbolts, with the proper tools at hand, should be a piece of cake. I sure am wrong a lot. Seems like half of what I post is me talking about the way things should have worked out, and the other half is me talking about how they didn't. Maybe I need some new hobbies. Something simple, like fingerpainting. The worst part is I didn't even get to the part where I get to fail to install the new deadbolt, I got stuck at the part where I fail to uninstall the old one. This should be simple, I got all the big pieces off, leaving me with that little doodad (technical term) in the middle, by all rights the darned thing should just slide out, or twist out, something like that, but the infernal object WILL NOT MOVE!! I tried pulling, pushing, twisting, I looked for hidden screws, I tried it will the bolt in, and with the bolt out, I put my left leg in and I shake it all about, I do the hokey pokey and I turn myself..... So sometime soon, I'm gonna take someone up on their offer to help me change the locks, and they're gonna take one look at it, and magically remove it, no muss, no fuss, no problem, and then I'm gonna scream. Really loud.

      So, I work in a call center, and I talk to 100-150 people a day, mostly I talk to a lot of Michaels, Johns, Jennifers and Angelas, with surnames like Smith and Jones, but occasionally I get to talk to people with names so wacky, zany, amusing, or just plain strange that I feel the need to share them.  One day last week, within an hour of each other, I spoke to a gentleman by the name of Daiquiri, and a girl named Margarita. Now just imagine the possibilities if these two got together, and had little ones. They could refer to them as their little snow cones. Maybe a son named Mojito and a daughter named Chambord? Or they could have a large alcoholic family, including Cosmopolitan, Franjelico, Tom Collins, Caipirinha, Gilroy, Brantini, and Martini. (Oooh, looking for good alcoholic names, I found a drink called "Heather's Blush," made with 1 oz of scotch, 1 oz of strawberry liqueur, and 3 oz of sparkling wine sounds like 5 0z of horrible hangover-inducing numminess)  Today I spoke to a girl named Jenny Wall Tart; sometimes it's just too easy.

      I had a cute little happy post planned for tonight, mostly I was gonna make fun of my friend Amy's culinary ambitions for this evening, (I went over to her house for awhile tonight and she fed me, [you have to understand that Amy is an EXCELLENT cook, I always look forward to being her "guinea pig" for new meal ideas] tonight we had a very interesting combination of taco meat with cheese and sour cream, with a side of (very very very nummy) sauteed shrimp with cocktail sauce. But ya'll are gonna have to make your own jokes on that one tonight, cause I just lost the heart. My computer does this thing where it saves the information that was typed into a given field for recall later, and as I was logging on to blogger tonight, a new option presented itself, it was the name of a character Shane had on Everquest. Not only was he in my home, but he was on my computer, and with not so much as a note to let me know he'd been here. As far as I can see, he didn't disturb anything, except for me. I guess it's officially time to change the locks, and demand the garage door opener thingy back, I've haven't done it yet, cause he still has a few things here, and it seemed as if it would be in bad faith, but I just can't live like this. I spent the last half hour looking around my house, opening cabinets and drawers, trying to figure out why he was here, what he took, what he went through. I have no way of knowing if he found this site, or my private journal for that matter, (on paper, sometimes I still like to experience the pain of writers cramp as I pour my heart out) I used to keep it in my car, but recently moved it inside, it seemed like a good idea at the time. And now I'm gonna go to bed, and freak out at every little sound, unsure, and insecure in my own home.

      I resolve not to cry myself to sleep.  This is why I find myself awake and writing at this hour of the morning, instead of in bed sleeping as I should be, I gave it a shot, it didn't work out. Please pardon my self-indulgence, but I seem to be feeling a wee bit sorry for myself all of a sudden. Normally I'm able to keep such feelings at bay by reminding myself how good I really do have it. All and all the universe has been pretty kind to me, and I have much to be thankful for, and I am thankful, but still, there are times when I just can't seem to stop myself from wallowing in self-pity and self-doubt. I feel very alone right now, very lonely, and very scared. (wow that's a lot of verys, even for me) The little voice in my head that tells me everything is gonna work out seems to have taken an unscheduled vacation, while the one that foretells doom and gloom is working overtime. (these are metaphorical voices, of course, the real voices only tell me to kill people, and bargain shop) I spent the evening hanging out with a married couple I know, their relationship is about as dysfunctional as they get, and yet, they seemed so happy, so comfortable, I miss that comfortability, that togetherness. I was so miserable for so long, but misery loves company, after all, and at least I had that. What if I never have that again? Alright, that's about enough of my whining, sorry folks.

      Just took the little doggie down to the river. I'm not exactly sure why, but it was the most fun I've had all week. Maybe it was being in the cool water after such a hot day, maybe it was the playful tug-of-war/fetch game we had going on, maybe it was the beer on an empty stomach, but whatever it was, it was a blast. My original plan was to let her play in the water, occasionally throwing a ball for her, while I read my book and tried to get myself a bit of tan. You know what they say about the best laid plans....She got the ball out of my bag in the car and I didn't remember to put it back in, but luck was on my side, and someone had left an orange plastic buoy sitting around (these things are rather expensive as dog toys go, I've been meaning to get her one for awhile, but could never bring myself to spend the $8-10) So we get down to the little hidden away spot that I like to take her to, and I set out my towel, grab my "beer", (actually it was "Seagram's smooth" which is a lot like "Mike's hard lemonade" but not so sweet, and currently selling at Grocery Outlet for the bargain price of only $2.99 a 6-pack) strip down to my swimsuit, and let her off her leash. She runs for the water, gets herself soaking wet, gets out of the water, and gets me (and the towel) soaking wet. I figure I just need to give her a minute, and take out my book, get comfortable and start reading. (sometimes I can be sooooooooo stupid) it takes her all of 3 seconds to get water all over my book. At this point I at least have the sense to put my book back in the bag, and get in the water, where her splashing and shaking won't annoy me so much. Basically I spent the next hour just playing with her, it had been almost a year since she'd had a chance to swim, (I'm such a bad mom) so I had to coax her into the deeper areas slowly (luckily she's so small, I can stand in water that comes just past my knees, and she has to swim) but before long she was going up to 10 yards out to fetch the buoy. The only downers were when she scratched my big toe, causing immense amounts of pain, and a fair amount of blood, and when these two,  very  cute boys (in case anyone was wondering I call all members of the opposite sex, who are under 50, boys, and to anyone who takes offense I say "the difference between a boy and man is that a man doesn't mind being referred to as a boy" [to my knowledge this is my quote, if anyone said it before me, please let me know so I may give them credit]) came along setting out on a little rafting trip. I was a little embarrassed to be seen as I was, sans makeup, and decked out in my swimsuit. I don't look my best in a bathing suit, kinda hard to hide the imperfections in something with so little fabric, stretched so thin. In fact I don't think any of my friends have even seen me in a swimsuit, to my recollection I hadn't worn one out in public (in this country) for at least 4 years. But the boys were off soon enough, leaving the puppy and I in peace. Ok, I guess that wasn't the most exciting story. Meh...

      Another fabulous Sunday of garage sale bliss. I actually managed to come home with one thing I had hoped to find today, a microwave. At least now I can add microwavable popcorn to my diet.  My best purchase, (in my estimation, although Cyrena did agree) was a tickle-me-Elmo for the bargain price of only $2, normally that would be too steep for a stuffed toy, but we're talking about TICKLE-ME-ELMO! I remember when this was the hottest toy on the market, everyone needed one, they were selling them on E-bay for extortionate sums, and I got it for $2, $2, at a garage sale!!!! Ok, probably I should calm down now, it is after all only a toy I don't need, I don't have any kids, and I don't think my cat is gonna be impressed, my dog will love it, but my dog has a tendency to eat the things she loves, so more than likely I'll keep her and Elmo separated.  Also in the toy I don't need department I picked up a little stuffed Spider-man, and a tie-dyed monkey that makes monkey sounds and moves its legs, (possibly the most annoying toy ever) for .25 each. I found 3 movies I couldn't live without, for $1 each, "The birdcage" and two chick flicks, "Notting Hill" and "Jerry Mcguire." I'm a girl; I'm allowed to like romantic comedies, Right? I got a bunch of books for .25 (including "Thinking about women, sociological perspectives on sex and gender" just 'cause I liked the title) and 4 comic books (2 spider-man, an X-files, and a hellshock) for .50 each. I don't even read comic books, but they were so cheap, and in really good condition, and I liked the covers, I really am hopeless where bargains are concerned.  That brings us to the title item, the "yes folks I really am crazy" item, before I tell you what it was, I do want to point out that I only paid $1 for it, and that really is a bargain, you see, I purchased a wedding dress. It was an impulse buy, of course, as I was going up to pay for some books I just casually asked how much they were charging for it, and after hearing it was only a buck I just couldn't resist, it even came with a little hat/veil thingy, I figure it'll make a good Halloween costume, the idea of me as a blushing bride being appropriately improbable and scary.

      Last night before going to bed I realized I hadn't really eaten yesterday, (unless you count the little bag of potato chips I had at work) after a quick glance through my cupboards, fridge and freezer I settled on a delicious and nutritious dinner of ramen. If this was a unique experience it wouldn't be so bad, but that's a pretty typical account of my dinnertime festivities; I look through my larder, find nothing worth actually cooking and either decide that eating is overrated or settle on ramen. The good news is I actually  like  ramen, and I seem to have lost a little weight, (I'm beginning to think that I'm forever doomed to believe that I would look perfect if I could just lose 20lbs) the bad news is ramen doesn't stick with you at all, so I woke up hungry this morning. (and yesterday morning, Thursday morning was ok though, cause I had Doritos for dinner on Wednesday) Now I'm not much of a breakfast fan, (that's not entirely true, I love breakfast, just not in the morning, people like me are why restaurants serve breakfast all day) so waking up hungry always puts me in a bad mood, I refuse to actually   eat   something (too lazy) so I have to walk that precarious line, alternating between coffee and soda, hoping against hope that heartburn won't rear it's ugly head. Naturally I have heartburn, and even more naturally my antacids are conveniently located at home, in the cupboard, right next to the hot sauce. (talk about product-placement) and all I have to eat at work are potato chips which will only make it worse.  Damned ramen

(cause I'm too lazy to try to find something, plus I'm at work, and I'd hate to get in trouble for looking for "porn")

      I finally saw the very talked about "Showgirls" and I've gotta say, it was everything I'd heard, and more. I wasn't completely prepared for the explicitness, and spent the first half of the movie blushing. (I'm not normally a blushing kind of girl, but watching a sexually explicit movie, at home, in the dark, with a [single and attractive {hehe...Now who's blushing}] member of the opposite sex...It's enough to turn this little girl pink) There were some technical difficulties before we could actually get the movie started, (there are always technical difficulties when I'm involved) the TV and DVD player were in different rooms, and as it turns out, weren't compatible. This led to a trip to Wal-mart to get a nifty little adapter thingy. (Yay for nifty little adapter thingies!) I don't love Wal-mart the same way I love the Dollar tree, but it still has that "things you don't need at prices YOU can afford" feel that makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Back to my place, thingy in hand, we (and by we I mean Durden, I just stood around offering moral support) got it all set up, only to find that for some strange reason it was in black and white. No amount of looking at the cords, and willing the TV to produce color worked, so eventually we gave up and watched it in black and white. I'm not sure if this movie was better or worse in black and white, but I do know that now I have to see it again, just so I'll know what it's like in color. That means I will have seen the worst movie in the world (that's probably not fair, I'm sure there are movies out there that are inferior to this one, but right off the top of my head I can't think of one) not once, but twice. There's just something about watching a movie in black and white that makes it seem more serious, which seemed to make this movie even more ludicrous, "Showgirls" is not the type of movie you can take seriously. At all. Ever. All things considered though, I actually kinda liked the movie. I feel dirty saying that, and not because of the sexual nature of the movie, but rather because it was just so  bad.  But it was bad in a good way, the sort of movie you don't have to feel bad about making fun of while you watch it and I laughed more than I do during most comedies. Not a bad way to spend a Wednesday night.

      I just checked the statistics for the last 10 days on my team at work, and every day I've had either the lowest, or second lowest call time, the highest number of calls, and the lowest time between calls. I knew my call times were good, but I had no idea I was excelling on all levels. Go me! No wonder my supervisor quit giving me those dirty looks.

       Wow, all of a sudden I seem to have gained popularity with the opposite sex.   I currently have 3 boys (for lack of a better word) pursuing me.  It's very flattering and all, but it's kinda messing with me.  First of all, I'm not really interested in any of them, for a variety of different reasons, (not the least of which being my crush on yet another boy [mmmm....other boy]) secondly, I'm really not in a position right now where I feel like I should be focusing any of my energy towards "dating." (or whatever it is they're calling it these days)

       Well, I had a lot more fun than I was expecting to on Friday.  We ended up going to the very appropriately name Jungle.  It's rare that I find myself feeling out of my element (mostly because I'm pretty careful to stay in it) but this was almost like a different world to me.  Different music, clothes, people, and just to fit in, I ordered a different drink than usual (jungle juice, and I don't recommend it)

      I don't go to the doctor very often, if I can avoid it.  I don't like doctors, don't get me wrong, I think it's great what they do, and I have oodles of respect for how much they have to know, and how hard their job is, and my doctor is a really nice guy, but I just don't like to visit him.  First of all, you have to make an appointment, which means listening to really crappy hold music for 10 minutes, where a really, really, mellow voice interrupts every 16 seconds, telling you that your call is important, and then (at least at my doctor's office) informing you that Monday's are their busiest day, for faster assistance don't call on Monday.  (Mind you, I've never actually called my doctor's office ON a Monday, but I still have to listen to this fabulous advice, personally I think they should have one of those recordings for every day of the week, just to fuck with the hypochondriacs)  Then, when you finally get to talk to one of the receptionists, once they finally figure out who the hell you are, (do they really need that much information to identify you?  I know for a fact, that there is no one else in this county with my name, and yet, I still have to divulge my date of birth, the last four digits of my social security number, my phone number, address, my mother's maiden name, and my bra size) they ask you why you want to see the doctor (so far in my life this has been a relatively embarrassment-free process, but just imagine what it would be like to have something weird going on, this, of course would never be an issue for little old moi, but imagine trying to make an appointment to discuss something like pre-mature ejaculation.  How the heck could you bring yourself to mention that to that perky little receptionist?  I mean, you know you're gonna have to look her in the eye when you go in for your appointment, she's gonna hand you that book-sized stack of paperwork she's going to insist you fill out, and she's going to  know  why you're there) Ok, you've managed to secure an appointment, at a time that is only mildly inconvenient for you (my favorite is when they ask you your preference on days, and times, and then, once you've stated that Tues or Thurs between 10 and 12 would be best for you, they ever so sweetly offer you one appointment on Tuesday at 8:15 or any number of appointments on Weds between 1 and 5) you show up 10 minutes early, just as they instructed you to, stand in line for 7 minutes while some really sweet mostly deaf old lady in front of you tries to schedule an appointment on a Tuesday between 10 and 12, and then once you make it up to the desk, they have to do the whole identification thing again, and that's when they give you the book to fill out, I'm pretty lucky  as I can pretty much just check no on everything, me and my family are all pretty healthy, but what gets me is that you have to write down why you're there again.  Especially because we all know what happens next, once they've taken the forms back, you've sat back down, and just gotten into in one of the articles in the only magazine in the lobby that even remotely interested you, the Medical assistant or Nurse, comes to take you back to the examining room, where she weighs and measures you, takes your blood pressure, and  asks you why you're there .  She does this while she's actually reading your file, where, at last count, it should already be written down twice.  Do people change their minds a lot when they're going to the doctor's office?  Do you make an appointment because your back is hurting, and then when you get there decide you'd actually like to get an EKG?  Or plan to discuss a new diet and exercise regime, but instead request a splint for your sprained wrist? Then you're stuck there in that little room, with two pictures, one of a tranquil outdoor scene, and the other some sort of cartoon with an amusing, and heartwarming phrase on it, a poster detailing the knee, and a bunch of little pamphlets.  (Am I the only one who longs to snoop around in the drawers and cabinets during this seemingly endless expanse of time?  I never actually do, I always end up reading those stupid little pamphlets, and inevitably by the time the doctor knocks on the door I've finished the ones detailing the warning signs of migraines, heart disease, breast and skin cancer, and have moved on to drug addiction, herpes, or pyromania)  After quickly shoving the pamphlet on kleptomania into your pocket, you tell the doctor to come in, he sits down, starts looking through your chart, and then, he too, asks you why you're there. You of course tell him, because your only other option is yelling at him and that just doesn't seem like such a great plan, seen as he's the guy who writes out your prescriptions, not really the person, you want mad at you.  I mean, you piss of your dry cleaner, worst case scenario your clothes come back with stains in embarrassing places, you piss off your doctor, and you could end up causing stains in embarrassing places.   He nods his head a lot, and the fills out a little slip of paper, tells you to take one of these twice a day, and moves on to his next patient.
