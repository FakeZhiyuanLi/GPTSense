      i was emotionally low to a great extent yesterday.. i'm not exactly sure what sparked it.. but i broke down... ranting on and on to myself.. why am i the way i am? i envy those who know exactly what they want.. i have no preferences as to what i want to do with my life... dreams push you to reach them... then it must be better to have many dreams, and realize that one cannot be accomplished, rather than to have no dreams at all... without reachable dreams in view, you tend to sit around waiting for fate to look you in the eye and tell you what it has in store for you... is that what i'm waiting for?     "We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering, these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for."

      bored... ored... red... ed... d... another afternoon with nothing better to do.. hahaaayyyy.... wrote a song... well, actually, i started it last month or something... finished it a couple days ago... well, finished for now... here it is....     false hope   i feel this way falling back into my pit residing back into the darkness why does it always turn out this way why again just when i've regained the light i don't know why why don't you tell me maybe you understand  it's just not fair the story of my life subsiding back into the shadows i just don't understand anything nothing now i felt that i was maybe special special in your eyes false hope did arise  you should have told me you left me hanging hanging to my death maybe if you found out that i died maybe you'd understand  nobody can see beneath the visible falsity they think they've got me figured out but hey look what they got so unreal cover your face, your faceless lies coz i said so why don't you do it so maybe i'll understand  i feel this way falling back into my pit residing back into the darkness why does it always turn out this way why again just when i've regained the light i don't know why maybe you understand  you should have told me you left me hanging hanging to my death maybe if you found out that i died maybe you'd understand  you should have told me you left me hanging hanging to my death maybe if you found out that i died maybe you'd understand    i sorta patterned it after another song... well, the order of things, at least... it was patterend after the song "close yet far" by cky... one of my favorite songs at the moment... it's been my favorite since the first time i heard it, after someone told me to get it... i mean, i had only heard the intro, and already i was in love with the song... i played it over and over again... i would play it at least 20 times a day, and it was the only song i intentionally listened to for a couple weeks... to prove it to you, i do have a playlist on my computer that consists of "close yet far" 20 times... call me crazy... hehe.... well, i still do love that song, but it's not the only thing i listen to now... hehe... one of the reasons why i love it so much is because of the person that introduced me to it... really.. but it really is a good song... truly recommended...

      well, the so-called "REAL Rakistas" replied to that message.. i guess there's nothing else to say, so here's the message:    hm...interesting...well,you should have just shut your mouth also and respected the case that some people just couldn't be pleased by an artist like avril lavigne.you had presented good arguments,but quite poor premises...because you jumped into some inconclusive things.oh well...let them be,that's all.opinions are mere opinions...it's up to us whether to deny it or accept it.were not affected .Im just doing my thing,likewise with you.who can really tell what's right or wrong with it?almost everything is subjective...oh well...that's all...anyway,nobody's ever perfect.peace out!

      another boredom habit.. looking at people's pages on friendster.. i found an account named "weHATEavrilFANs".. this was her profile:     Occupation:   REAL Rakistas   Location:   Philippines   Interests:   Why do I care? Because Avril Lavigne is nothing but a stuck up little bitch. This girl's attitude is shit and not to mention she can't sing worth a shit either. I'm so sick of her.   Affiliations:   Real rock bands who really worked hard to get where they are today not like that poser who used punk as a fucking trend!   Companies:   They think that just because I wear black eyeliner and rubber bracelets that I'm trying to be Avril.   Schools:   Anti-Avril Academy   Favorite Music:   She is a no talent idiot..real Aggresive Punk Rock   Favorite Books:   Go Back to Canada Poser Bitch.     About Me:   I made this place because im sick off being labeled as her i meanjust because i wear chucks,spikes,warmers and eyeliner doesnt mean a like her than fucking bitch has done enough damage to the punk scene.    Another reason why I hate Avril Lavigne is because she is a full blown bitch. She constantly disses &quot;preps,&quot; and I quote &quot;after my shows all these loser preps come up to me and ask me for my autograph, i want to be like 'my music is not for you!'&quot; Thank you to the queen of stereotypes! Jeez, what a bitch. If I had fans I would be grateful for them no matter what kind of person they are. These are the people supporting her, buying her CDs, and buying tickets to see her shows, then she goes and disses them like that. She needs to get a fucking reality check on who she is.     Why am I grateful I'm not an Avril fan? It's simple. They're stupid. Didn't I tell you it was simple? But allow me to digress...     Look at the hatemail I've gotten. It's become clear to me that Avril fans have low grammatical skills, and couldn't come up with an original point of why Avril 'rawks hawrd' if their pathetic, seemingly worthless lives depended on it. The only facts I've gotten of why Avril supposedly &quot;rawks&quot; is that she's hot, she makes a lot of money, she's famous, and that she has talent. Okay. But what about her talent? What makes her any different from the 309823049283402380 other here-and-gone jaded pop stars? The only thing that sets her apart is because she's decided to take a ridiculed label and make it &quot;cool&quot;. As for looks, if you like disgruntled trash, I suppose she would be fairly attractive. I'll admit. I used to think Avril was pretty. I know all the words to Complicated. But I was going bandwagon for only a week or two, tops. When I learnt more about our favorite posergirl, I was immediately turned off by her lack of originality. I had been wearing black and white striped armwarmers, TWO of them, at skoo weeks before she caught on at my high skoo, before I even knew about her. And yet, I got condemned because I refused to wear one &quot;like Avril&quot;. So tell me, what's the message Avril's sending across again? Originality? I think not.   Another reason I've become fairly opposed to Avril fans, is the fact that they take the time to flame those of us expressing our own unique opinions about Avril, thinking it's going to stop us from doing it. And this may be being preached at 390428042380423094 other anti-Avril sites, but so be it. WE. DON'T. CARE. In fact, when somebody flames me, not only do I laugh at the grammatical errors, I get others to laugh by being anything BUT angry. If you expect me to get mad because I'm &quot;not as pretty as her&quot; or &quot;u zuxxor, u btich!&quot;, I'm not. I laugh, then respond. If you're flaming me to get your own section up in the hate part of this site, you've won the grand spankin' prize. But not only that, you're the laughing stock of the internet community who hates Avril, like me. Congratu-friggin-lations, man. You got what you signed up for. Really, when I get flamed, I feel obligated to add more to the site. In fact, one site inspired me to draw a parody cartoon to add to this site. Inspiration comes from you, the haters. No matter how much you may hate me, I will love you for giving me more inspiration. It seems you're a walking contradiction, for when you flame, you seem to be trying to get me to think your way, but really, it only reminds me more and more of why I hate Avril and her fans so much. Thank you, thank you very much.   And I suppose those are the major reasons I tend to dislike Avril fans. Sure, this is pretty stereotyped. I'm very sure that not ALL Avril fans fit this criteria. But until I find an intelligent, well-supported Avril fan, I still laugh at you all.    Who I Want to Meet:   People often tell me I'm jealous. All I have to say to that is &quot;Are you jealous of everyone you hate?&quot; Of course not. So why would I be jealous of Avril? She's not cute, she has no talent, she's a hypocrite, she's annoying, she's a bitch, and she should be deported.     ok, so after reading all of this crap from a so called "REAL rakistas", i wrote her a message... hehehe... and it actually made me feel better about myself for a while... the message:    hey... i'm not with you, nor against you.. i just thought i'd point out a couple things that i thought you should know:  1.) if you hate her like you say you do, then why are you giving her so much friggin attention?!? don't think so? well, you went through the whole process of making a why-i-hate-avril essay, and, of course, your famous "parody cartoon".. like it or not, that's still devoting your time to her.. if you hate her like you say you do, then you'd just let her go unnoticed... let her be, and in time, she'll die out on her own...  2.) i noticed how you kept bringing up the fact that most of her fans weren't too good at english.. well, by bringing that up as many times as you did, that puts our expectations up higher for YOUR english... oh, by the way, i did notice errors in your english AND the english of the so-called avril haters... i would think you wouldn't accept the testimonials written by those with low grammatical skills.. ha! boy, did i think wrong.. oh, just so you know, if i just so happen to have grammatical errors in this message, (1) this isn't going public anyway, and (2) i dare you to point them out for me...  3.) you say that avril is sterotypical... well how about you and the rest of the avril-hating world? the way you judge the avril fans is no different than the way she judges preps.. ever think of it that why? i doubt it.. how egotistic is someone who puts up a friendster account devoted to hating someone else? how about the rest of this "hating society" that supports this egotist? how big are their egos?  4.) let's see... you have 91 friends in this account, which means that you've found at least 91 people who share in your opinion.. you've reached out and affected around 91 people... how many do you think avril lavigne has affected? chances are, more than you could ever imagine.. like it or not, she has fans, and there's not much you can do about it...  5.) you say that you're inspired by all those avril fans out there who send you hatemail, right? don't you ever wonder that maybe you're inspiring them too? if you answered "no" to that last question, THINK AGAIN.. you're just fuelling their rage against people like you, and inspiring them to become even bigger fans of avril lavigne...  6.) correct me if i'm wrong, but you are, deep at heart, an avril lavigne fan... you would have been like one of those who praise avril, except maybe, along the way, you were afraid it would put a bad mark on your reputation as a so-called (and i quote) "REAL Rakistas"... think again... a real rocker (as i would say it) would learn to keep her mouth shut..    well, she hasn't replied... which is pretty funny... hehe... maybe i'll go diss a couple more...

      there's this guy who's been acting like such a jerk... and i listened to this song again, and realized that it FITS... especially this one part... see, that's what i do, if i can't make songs, i just connect with them...  I’m caught in the symmetry of your mind. But I’m not happier than you. Did I really see you or was it a dream? Dreaming that it was seemles, not a trace of wrong.   Wrong words that we have spoken . Little did we know.  -->  conversations crash   No bigotry, No tearshed. Oh if only   -->  not worth my tears   You’d try to be polite thinking you were right only to find that you’re unkind.   -->  tryna be polite, but failing at it  But ironically you will always be  belle of the ball at least to me. I’m caught in the symmetry of your mind.  But I’m not happier than you.   But my words are frail not audible they do not even convince me perheaps they are untrue.   -->  my words mean nothing  Truly with you the worst is always true. I gave you all the benefits of all the doubts I had never hoped to be as benign as me. Funny how you always get through  but ironically  you will always be belle of the ball at least to me.

      They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are many things about yourself that you didn't know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get scared because you barely know where you are now.  You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to aren't exactly the greatest people you have ever met, and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you don't recognize is that they are realizing that too, and aren't really cold, catty, mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you.  You look at your job... and it is not even close to what you thought you would be doing, or maybe you are looking for a job and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and that scares you.  Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and are constantly adding things to your list of what is acceptable and what isn't. One minute, you are insecure and then the next, secure. You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly, change is the enemy and you try and cling on to the past with dear life, but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away, and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward.  You get your heart broken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you. Or you lie in bed and wonder why you can't meet anyone decent enough that you want to get to know better. Or maybe you love someone but love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you know that you aren't a bad person.  One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap. Getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic.  You go through the same emotions and questions over and over, and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You worry about loans, money, the future and making a life for yourself... and while winning the race would be great, right now you'd just like to be a contender!  What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out.

      this was a suggestion from a friend of mine... usually, i'd make a song or poem or something to get things off my mind... leaving everything up to divine inspiration... but my muse tends to fail me... so this is my alternative... blogging... so much has been going through my mind... and no matter what i do, no matter how many people i talk to about it all, it just won't leave my thoughts... i guess things with myself won't change / get better if i don't do anything about it... when it comes down to it, i am the only one who can change my life to the way i truly want it to be... happy... full of friends who i can depend on it times of need, rather than friends who'll take me for granted... they know who they are, and still they won't do anything about it... so here i'll stay... shamefully unnoticed... drowning in my own emotions, trying desperately to hold on, until someone can bring me back to sanity... get ready for one hell of an emotional session...

      following is a journal entry written by the lead singer of the band watashi-wa [which recently broke up after 8 years of being a band]... quite an eye-opener in a sense...     6-07-04 3:42 pm   i was waiting to try and recover all our old journal entry's beforei started writing new ones. but i say forget it... i always used to write in my journals when i was a kid and then years later read it andbe disgusted with how "immature" i was so i would throw the journals away. so yes we lost the old entry's...GOOD RIDDANCE  we are driving right now to play a show in saint george utah. when i was youngi dreamed of doing things like this. taking off on a random monday to play a show 2 states away from mine. dreams are funny. or maybe its me. yes in fact it is me. i recently discovered that, as foolish as it is...i have become more consumed with the dream of playing music...than the heart of that dream. i have been more consumed by the process of progress..than the purpose to progress.if you arent folowing. its like this. in a way...i thought it would be a good idea to ride my bike to the park and feed the ducks...but then got so caught up in trying to plan out which roads to take and which bread to bring...and pretty soon i was so concerned about the way to make it work that i forgot what i was going to the park to do in the first place. the fact is all ive ever wanted was for God to be glorified in my life. and inmy music. and so here we are...so backwards.. its so hard to feel what i felt when i was 15. so im slowing down. taking some time to breathe. and it feels like a whole new dream is being birthed. or maybe our dreams are just being renewed.either way . in all my days and lessons on the way and no matter what tommorrow brings you are all i ever need. and some things change...but moststay the same and im learning...again...to not cling so closely...or close at all...because you are all i need. so take these things off my back.. and give me the wisdom i lack.. today, all i do, all i say, i give these things to you. all my dreams, the ones i love..i surrender them to you again today. whatever today brings. i wrote that when i was 15. and its teaching me today... 6 years later.

       song playing:   CKY - close yet far    thinking about:   g and m    what i want to say to g:    it almost feels like slowly, i’m losing you... but still i manage to smile because i know life is not about who you lose, but about who you find...   i found you once... and i know that you found her... way before you came into my world... and since you think you've found 'the one' in her... it’s your turn to be happy... i had mine... somewhere along the way...   but please find it in your heart to show me that i'm really not losing you... and that you found me too... and that no matter what happens, that this will stay true...   i know i can't make you like me the way i want you to like me, if you don't... but i know i can make a difference in your life... if given the chance... so i'm asking you to give me a chance...    what i want to say to m:    someday, when i have the chance to say what i really want and have to say, and take that chance, i may hurt you... i may cause you the pain i've always tried to shield myself and others from...   if i do tell you to leave me and go away, please promise me you won’t listen... tell me you’ll stay... please put things back to the way they were, and i promise i won't be as arrogant as i have been... this time i'll be grateful...   the pain i may have given you is a burden that will befall me until this all turns out right... so, if you feel for me like you say you do, and how i hope you do, help me take this burden off my shoulders... or leave me... but just don't tell me you're giving up on me...    how i feel after typing all of this:    heavy-hearted...   the words poured out of me almost without a thought in my head... i never thought i felt this deeply about either of them... and now, being able to put this all into words, i realize that all i'm asking for is a chance to be heard... a chance to be known... a chance to put things right... a chance to make a difference...

       Again I Go Unnoticed  -Dashboard Confessional  So quiet. Another wasted night The television steals the conversation. Exhale. Another wasted breath again it goes unnoticed.  Please tell me you're just feeling tired, Cause if it's more than that I fear that I might break. Out of touch.  Out of time.  Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, Cause I can't read your rolling eyes. Out of touch.  Are we out of time?  Closed lipped Another goodnight kiss  Is robbed of all its passion.  Your thrill  Another time to slack  It leaves me feeling empty  Please tell me you're just feeling tired, Cause if it's more than that I feel that I might break. Out of touch.  Out of time  Please send me anything but signals that are mixed, Cause I can't read your rolling eyes. Out of touch.  Are we out of time?  I'll wait until tomorrow. Maybe you'll feel better then, Maybe we'll be better then. So what's another day When I can't bear these nights of thoughts of going on without you? This mood of yours is temporary. It seems worth the wait to see you smile again. Out of the corner of my eye Won't be the only way you're looking at me then.  So quiet. Another wasted night The television steals the conversation. Exhale. Another wasted breath Again it goes unnoticed.

       When people make secret blogs or even the old fashioned diaries, do they really mean to hide it from the world or do they secretly want to be found.   It sometimes is limiting to tell an inanimate object all that you have inside. It feels way better to have another live human being know something about you. A real connection is made. Which is what we all desire. Whether secretly or openly.  But of course if want you want to say is not something you want others to know, more so the people that do know you, secrecy is key then, I guess.    http://exaggeratedtruths.blogspot.com    was going through a blog of someone i don't even know... and right off the top, i could relate in a couple of the many many many entries... just thought this one sounded interesting... i mean, considering i am using this blog as a sort of 'diary' or something like that... but haven't told anyone the actual site... it's 'waiting to be discovered' i guess... in a way... but i have no problem with it going unnoticed...  since i know anyone can access this site, it's almost as if i want someone to read it... thus, making it the next best thing to telling someone openly about all i have to rant about...

      bummer... that's all i can say at the moment... bummer... very harsh realization has been taking place... heavy realization... you see, what i want from anyone, everyone even, is a chance... because i know i can make a difference in their life... or make it worthwhile... or help them... i will always give an effort into seeing that a smile is on their face... i will always be willing to be someone to call on, someone to just be a friend... someone anyone could rely on... but all i need is a chance to show them that i can be what they want... i can be what they need... if only they'd let me...  after all these years of begging for chances... and failing at it... then looking for more chances, being taken in, then losing to someone's change of mind... things have somehow slightly changed...  i never felt i needed anyone any less than they needed me... it always felt like i was the one that needed the person much more than that person needed me... well, this was apparent in how easily they seemed to move on, as opposed to how much it crushed me to see another one come and gone...  now there's another problem... i was too busy worrying about my friendship with one person lately (to be referred to as G), that i forgot about two other friends (M and J)... i really liked G, and i didn't want him to just be another with a sweet beginning and a bitter ending in my life... i was so worried about keeping my relationship with him that it put a screen up in my view towards others... little did i realize that that chance that i had always been waiting for was staring me straight in the eye...   since the moment i met M and J, i honestly didn't think much of them... hearing that they were much younger than me didn't help... they would contact me almost everyday... i thought it was nice to have more friends in the beginning, but within a week or so, i started to feel somewhat annoyed... i got closer to M than i did to J because J would contact my other friend more (who was also contaced less by M)... i started getting tired of M... it seemed that everytime we would chat or text, it would be another getting-to-know-you session... i couldn't stand to hear him say "tell me more about yourself" one more time...  i told a couple of my friends about M and J... asking them for advice... "should i just go along with it?"... "should i do something about it?"... i even asked G about the situation... i told him that the little "hints" i was giving weren't clicking in their head... so he gave me advice and said "either you make yourself sound like the most boring person alive... no secrets, no interests, nothing... your identity wouldn't be worth getting into..." i told him that it probably wouldn't work, because it's too late to sound dull, after around 2 weeks of normal conversations... then he said "then pretend you have a boyfriend or something... go on and on about how great this guy is... it's gotta get to them someday..." so that's what i did... the next day, i told M that i just got a bf... he immediately asked for his name, and i told him that G was my boyfriend... i had talked about him before... probably mentioned him a couple times... and he was the first person that came to mind... so for around 3-5 days, i hadn't heard from M or J (i stopped hearing from J a while back already), and i thought to myself "they're gone? just like that?"  but then i realized that talking to them, indeed became a regular thing... and even though they were starting to really bug me, i waited for them to text me or send me a message on ym... i would expect them... after a couple days, they did start contacting me again, and it was "back to normal"... except i really saw them as friends this time...  somewhere along the way, M asked me for a textmate... i had the perfect person in mind, and i exchanged their numbers... i had told this friend of mine about them, and she decided to see for herself if they were really how i had described them to be... yes, she did agree with me, after talking to them a couple times... she, too, thought that they were, to a large extent, the annoying, up-in-your-face kind of person... a couple times, we would talk about them, and then i realized that it had been almost 3 weeks, and i didn't hear from them... i tried to contact them, but i didn't get any answer... the unexpected had become a reality... i actually missed them...  you see, when my friend would talk about how annoying they were, i realized so many things about them... so many good things... i realized that they never had anything bad to say... i realized that they were dependable, in those 2-3 months when we would regularly contact each other... and i started seeing a bit of me in them... i realized that this was the chance i had been waiting for... and that i blew it... and when i saw myself in them, i realized that i wasn't giving them a chance either... in failing to give them a chance, i wasn't giving myself a chance either...  a while back, i had found out that M liked me as more than a friend... this was after i told him that i had a so-called boyfriend... so, i would tell myself that if he got his heart broken, it would have been partially his fault... shame on my for thinking such a thing... i was blaming a lie i made for a hypothetical heartbreak he would have delivered himself... i felt bad when i found out that he had feelings for me... i kept telling myself "i know heartbreak all too well, i couldn't stand to even think that i could break the heart of someone that i saw myself in..." it crushed me...  i actually had, and still have feelings for G, and i knew that even if i told M that i was lying about having a boyfriend, i still had feelings for someone else, and that could still result in heartbreak for either one of us...  this heavy feeling dates back to the earlier conversations between me and G... we were both in the very painful situation of having very strong feelings for another, when that person would only see you as a friend... thus, we ended up the low-key bestfriend to the one that we cared most deeply about... after countless times of telling G, and telling myself that no one deserves to be put in that situation... no one deserves to feel like nothing to the person that means the world to them... i couldn't just put M in that situation, whether or not he felt that deeply about me... i couldn't just let him end up in that same painful situation... it'd break my heart before i could put anyone in that situation... it's too much a burden... it's too heavy a feeling... when you end up blaming yourself for all the pain that you're going through...  i've been trying to contact them for the past week or so... but it seems they're ignoring me or something... i just lost another chance...  you're probably thinking "why worry about them when i have G, right?" well, i'm still very much in contact with him... but it feels like things have just become "routine" on his part... and yet again, i'm probably grasping him too tightly... afraid to lose him, now, more than ever...
