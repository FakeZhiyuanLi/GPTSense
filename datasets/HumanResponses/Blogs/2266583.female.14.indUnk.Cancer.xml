      Yesterday...  Jake and I got home at about 15.30 and my mom wasn't home. I also didn't have my key, so there was no way to get in the house, and it's about 85 degrees out so I had a headache from being in that all day.  So we sat and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited some more until we finally came to a conclusion that WE SHOULD CALL HER.  But where? The neighbors? No, they're not home.  Citgo? No, I have to take a hike up that long ass hill and Jake doesn't want to.  AHA. I got it. Sheetz.   But there is a problem with going to Sheetz... I have to cross a main road (which is really no prob), but then there is the Route 8 on and off-ramp. That is so hard to cross, especially around 3-5. But we have no choice.  Also my mother would have a heart attack if she found out we almost got hit by a semi (shhhhhhh!).  So we run into the Sheetz place so I can get two quarters out of my 65 cents *snort*. So I got my two quarters, and we went out to use the Verizon Wireless pay phone.  Yeah. You know their motto, "We never stop working for you", right?  Well their phone was screwed up. I couldn't even get my change back, and we had no time to go in to get it back.  So we ran back, and it's about 16.25 now. So we stopped at Best Buy and they let us use their phone. I called my mom, and DAMN was she pissed! But you know, I always say it's better to be pissed off then pissed on! LMAO. So the tone of her voice made us feel kinda queasy. Ecspecially when she said "THE FUCKIN' COPS ARE HERE, DAMNIT!" So my grandpa was on his way to pick us up.   We pulled in the driveway, and there they are.  The Akron Police.   All these thoughts were racing through my mind.. will I have a dermit on my record now?? Geez, I hope not... I'm only 11 and I have a clean record. Will I be sent to Juvenile??   So Officer Matson told us to have a seat on the porch.  So we did.  And we got a lecture.  A longgggggggggg lecture.  Of course, my mom is saying stupid things like, "I had gastric bypass surgery" "She is a straight A student" "Do you know Swain? I'm his buddy" and junk...  So I get inside, and we ran upstairs to my room so we woudn't be yelled at any more.  Ten minutes later, my mom calls me downstairs, and she is on the phone with Kim.  Shit.  She makes me talk to her and my mom at the same time... and she made me confess to the time I walked to Sheetz with my friend Becky back in October. She made me feel really bad by her tone of voice and how she said she thought she could  trust me by me not going back.   Uhhh I kinda had no choice here.  So now she is angry at me.  And I am grounded.  Day 2 : 5.14.04  Where do I start? I'll start at lunch.  I was sitting at my table, and my friend Tabby was sitting no less than 3 ft away from me, and she wanted to know if I had any extra taco sauce.   I did, so I tossed it to her, and she caught it.  But unfortunately, Mrs. Owens was looking right at us. Next thing you know, she's rambling on about how she doesn't want to see food flying around the cafe ever again. She was 3 feet away! So Mr. Garnett made us go stand in seperate corners across the room. That was bad enough, because I had to hold my lunch, and the tray was heavy. We had strawberry shortcake stuff with icing on it, and it got all over my white shirt. I had to cover it up with either my arms or my binder all day.  Also, I found out that one of my best friends is a bi, and they all ignored me except Tabby. Jake has really been getting on my nerves because he stole my friends and now they ignore me.  Taylor. Anna. Mika. Jess. Amber. Ashley. Lauren. Larrissa. Rebekah. And more...  Well that's it, I guess.
