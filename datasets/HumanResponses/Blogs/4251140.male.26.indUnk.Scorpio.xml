      So it's been raining like a bastard all day here. Started up in the early A.M. hours and has been coming down on and off until just about an hour ago. Normally I wouldn't care, but I need to mow my damn lawn. The homeowner's association (a fucking Nazi group if I've ever seen one) has sent me two letters telling me that I have 10 days to mow my lawn and "clean out the tree wells" or they will take "further action." Seriously... what the hell is that? I don't even know what a tree well is (I mean, I have a pretty solid idea but I've never heard it called tree wells before). I just can't believe that they would send me two letters about something like this. It's not like my lawn is a jungle and, besides, let's not kid ourselves. Fort Worth ain't exactly Beverly Hills. Hell, it's not even Dallas. There should be more important things to worry about.  But the rain has made that possible, so they're going to have to wait another day before my grass is cut.  So instead of walking around my admittedly-small yard for the next 45 minutes or so, I'm going to pour me a glass of wine to drink with my baked ziti for dinner, and then maybe lose an hour of my life that I'll never get back watching the boring-ass Olympics. Lotsa fun, I tell ya.

      Damn... I got seriously fucked up last night. One of those "let's just go out for a couple drinks" nights. Yeah, because that always works out like you plan it. So not only was I stumbling drunk at 4 a.m., but I decided it would be a good idea to play some internet poker... even though I could barely read the cards. Good times. I don't think I need to tell you how that worked out.  I ended up going to bed at about seven in the morning, so naturally my sleeping patterns are a bit out of wack and my head is rather cloudy. I gotta go run around the block a couple of times or something to wake my ass up....

      It is out of sheer boredom that I am entering the world of blogging. With work slow this time of year, I was stumbling across the web and found out that a few of my friends from college had these damn things, so I figured I should take a stab at one as well.  For some reason, I've been, for the most part, out in the dark on these blogs. Apparently there are like 600 million of them online, and I may very well be the last person with regular computer access to not have one.  So here's my question... why is it called a blog? What is that short for? I get that the "log" part but really don't see where the "b" comes into play. Why not call it "Ilog" for internet log or "dlog" for daily log or something like that? I realize it would probably take me all of 15 seconds to look it up, but I felt like mentioning it here instead.  The word blog just sounds like a type of STD you'd get after a night out in South Chicago more than an internet site, you know? "Yeah, I hooked up with that chick I met at Blyss on Saturday night and didn't use a condom. Bad move - she gave me the blog and now I have to apply this cream shit twice a day."  So you see, I prefer to just call this my webpage, instead of my blog. In the highly-unlikely scenario that people actually read this thing, I'll probably touch on a mixture of subjects, such as sports, nights out with the guys, random stories, everyday issues, politics and whatever else happens to come to mind. Enjoy!
