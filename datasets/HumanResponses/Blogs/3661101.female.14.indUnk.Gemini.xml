      Wow!  I don't think that i have been this tired since D.C.!  Last night, i had to watch my little cousin, Madison, because my aunt and uncle are moving, and she was up until 1am because she woke up late from her nap.  It was horrible.  She just wouldn't go to sleep.  And the worst part is i didn't end up falling asleep until 2, and i had cheerleading practice at 10am.  But, i didn't think it would be that bad.  But then Madison wakes up this morning a 7am!!!  I only got 5 hours of sleep!!! So, whenever i don't get a lot of sleep, i feel like i'm gonna throw up, so i felt like crap for half the morning.  And then for the rest of the day i had a headache.  So i finally decided to lay down at around 4pm; and luckily i fell asleep.  I splept until 6:20pm, which was when i had to get up because my dad was coming to pick me up since tomorrow is Father's Day.  But i am still so tired.  And omg... i swear, my mom can be bipolar sometimes.  It's crazy.  When i told my mom that i wanted to go to my dad's house, she went crazy.  It was really weird, but my dad is here now.  So i will write later.  Bye.

      Yeah... today is such a blah day for me.  My mom's best friend, Lisa, is moving so my mom is helping her.  But the thing is, is Lisa, is moving from a big house to an apartment (for reasons), and so she can't fit all of her crap in her new tiny home.  So we are getting some of her things like her couch, and refridgerator and big new things like that.  So anyways, since i have to go to cheerleading in a little (unfortunately), i have to stay home and clean the house.  But i sooo don't want to.  I have been mopey all day, and i like it like that because i have been so busy this entire week.  So, all i really want to do is just sleep, but off course, that can't happen.  And there are some other problems too, but i think my mom will be here any minute to give me some food, and i'm not supposed to be on the computer; i'm supposed to be cleaning.  So yeah, i'm gonna get off so i don't get in trouble.  Bye.

      Hey!!!  I just made this thing like 15 seconds ago.  Woohoo!!!  But, yeah, my ass hurts because i have been sitting down in this retarded 'doughnut' thing because i BROKE my TAILBONE!!!  It hurts pretty bad rite now, but it's weird.  Like somedays it will only hurt a little, and then there are other days when i feel like if i dont take some advil rite now, i'm gonna die.  So yeah, its weird.  But since i am in pain i think i am going to go to bed.  So thats it.  Bye!

       Okay... so yesturday ( or actually i guess 2 days ago ), i was supposed to go to my dads, but he never called to let me know what time he was coming to get me; so i just figured that he wasnt coming.  But then, he ends up calling at like 7:30 to see if i was coming over, which usually wouldnt be that bad, but i had plans to babysit my cousin that nite.  So i told him that and asked if he could pick me up later, but he got all mad and said no.  And you know, of course i cant tell him well, you should have called earlier.  So then i had to call my grandma to see if she could babysit my cousin and she said it was fine, but no, my aunt and uncle didnt believe me because they thought it would be too much for her and that it was wrong that i changed my mind at the last minute.  And i mean it was, but they dont understand how hard it is to even just talk to my dad, like a normal conversation, let alone tell him i wasnt coming over.  So then, before they called my grandma, they were all like, 'oh, you know what, we just shouldnt even go to the moveis, i dont want to make mom even more tired than she is'.... obviously trying to make me feel like shit for not staying.  And that just made me so upset because my dad was giving me shit for wanting to stay, and they were giving me shit for not wanting to stay.  So basically, all of my positive energy went bye bye.  And then once everyone got things figured out, like they were still going to the movies, and i was going to my dads, jack, my stepfather, calls me into the kitchen to rag on me about how i should wash the dishes from dinner before i leave.  And that just totally pissed me off, so i nodded and never ended up doing them.  So... i was really upset for the rest of the night.  And i just hate it, because there is usually crap like this and i just cant handle it.  But i got to go because i am at my dads now, and it is really late (which is why i am writing now... so i can be along)  and my step mom should be home soon from her stupid concert that she went to tonight; and she would flip out if she got home and i was on the computer.  So, oh... i will write later about what a bitch she has been this weekend.  Bye.
