      Let me first preface this testimony by saying that I do not have a step by step plan laid out to be put into motion, nor that I am yet living out what I am about to advocate. I have only a vision and the example of Christ’s compassion. Today, I want to cast that vision to you all as beloved children of God and as bond servants of Jesus Christ.  When I was a junior in high school at 16 years old, I began to memorize the book of Acts as part of the Bible quizzing program here at Grace. As I memorized these inspiring and humbling accounts of the work of the Holy Spirit in the lives of the first followers of Jesus Christ, it was also the very first time I was ever reading them. The vision that God continues to give me today concerning the church began as I was captivated by these stories of how the gospel that Jesus Christ preached spread against all impossibilities. Yet, “stories” is too trivial a word for such accounts, for these were tangible events in the lives of real, broken people, who having seen in human form the compassionate heart of Almighty God, surrendered themselves fully to the work of his power in their lives, regarding the cost and paying the price.  The affect that these accounts have had on my life is immeasurable and will continue to be that way for the rest of my life. What faith. What risk. What love. What power. I have longed ever since for something similar to be my experience with the worldwide group of people known as Christians. Or as the dean of the chapel at Taylor University used to call us, little Christs.  Yet this was a radically different church than the one I knew. I knew only what the church had become, not what it was intended to be. I knew the American version of the church. I knew a mindset of “get the most out of it with as little investment as possible”. I knew denominations that bickered. I knew five, eight, and twelve step programs to spiritual health, maturity, and blessings. I knew that Christians in America would support the so-called “inalienable rights” of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, even though Christ called them instead to death, slavery and the pursuit of righteousness.  The church I knew only faintly, if at all, resembled the one I read about in the pages of Acts. It had become a stale institution instead of continuing as a dynamic movement.  The first few hundred years of the dynamic movement of the church spawned hundreds of martyrs and built the foundation for what would become the most prominent religion in the world, Christianity. Although God continued to use his people to accomplish his purposes, the church abandoned its pursuit as a movement and settled for life as a national religious institution. It has been settling for less than its calling ever since.  But what if we decided to start a movement again. Not a new movement, but the continuation of that which was started by those who had seen Jesus face to face. The empire in which we live in today is not wholly unlike the Roman Empire of the early centuries. In fact, America has not yet gone so far in its debauchery and greed to give the Roman empire a run for its money. But we do live in an empire desperate for the Kingdom of God to come to it. And only a dynamic movement can usher in that Kingdom so that it may rescue a dying generation.  I want to invite you today to re-imagine the church. To actually take time to image how a dynamic movement of “little Christs” could introduce a new and changing, but still suffering, world to the Kingdom of God. To imagine storming the gates of hell before the gates of hell storms us. To re-imagine discipleship. To re-imagine evangelism. To re-imagine worship.  If you would, write this question down and your personal answer to it. “If you could do ANYTHING for the Kingdom of God and not fail, what would it be?”  Dream big. Dream ridiculously big, as a child does. Imagine it, and ask your Father that it would be so. And know that he is able to do immeasurably more. Re-imagine your role in proclaiming that the Kingdom of God is here. Re-imagine the church.

      no longer will I ask for the removal of my tears.  no longer will I complain about the sorrow in my heart.  you have done this.  you have done this.  yes, you have done this good thing and the end of me is near.  you are doing what I have dreamed of,  accomplishing what my heart has longed for.  in your way, in your time, and at the expense of all that I have worked so hard to build.

      The fog over my life is not as dense as it once was, and gradually the picture is becoming clear.  The truth of that picture tempts the soul to long again for the dark fog of Egypt.  In the transition from darkness to light there are always shades of grey.  Grey is the most sorrowful and depressing place to be.  My thoughts torment me in the morning.  My stomach is constantly churning.  My mind continually replays senarios of my life.  "My tears have been my food day and night."  Somehow, in the grey, I'm always one step closer to the light.  One step closer to complete freedom.  One step closer to healing.  One step closer to not being able to see the darkness because I'm now on the other side of the grey fog.  The burden is so heavy.  It's so deep.  It's so ugly.  Yet, it is not new.  It is how it has always been.  My self-mastery has failed.  The mask I've worn has melted.  The truth has been unveiled and I am without excuse.  There are no more gifts, no more talents.  There is nothing left to shield me from seeing who I really am.  And there is indeed nothing left to do, except in my nakedness to embrace the splintery cross; to let the jagged wood sink into every layer so that all of me runs out and all of him flows in.

      Today marks the third day of our journy from Mooresville to Los Angeles.  Our first stop on Sunday evening brought us to Rolla, MIssouri, where we were unfortunate enough to watch the fourth quarter of another Pacer’s homecourt debacle.  We’ll see what tonight holds for them in Detroit.  Yesterday took us to Oklahoma City, our first intentional stop for entertainment: the Women’s College World Series (fast-pitch softball).  UCLA played California in Oklahoma City, go figure that logic out.  Anyway, it was a great game with Cal scoring early in the first inning, but being overtaken by three runs from UCLA in the bottom of the fifth.  That was it, game over.  The game was followed by what my mom called a fireworks “extravagation”.  It’s a apparentlly a mix between an extravaganza and a celebration.  Much laughter ensued.  After breakfast at the IHOP this morning and a tumbler full of Panera’s Hazelnut House Blend coffee, we were on our way west to Amarillo (not quite by morning for you George Strait fans) and on to Albuquerque for our evening meal.  I’m writing from the outskirts of Amarillo, and I’m guessing that at some point or another I have eaten a hamburger or perhaps a filet mignion from the vast plains we are passing that are dotted with cattle. Mmmmm.... (ha! mom just killed the engine on the stick shift, more laughter).  The flat plains remind me of Africa, where you can see for miles without a building in sight (besides a farm house or two off in the distance).  My imagination wonders what America looked like before it was “civilized”, when the land was untainted by concrete and cinder blocks and the buffalo populated the “empty” space.  And now, I’m traveling through those same plains on I-40 westbound at 80 miles per hour, typing on my  iBook.

       We have a notorious problem with moving people up because of talent. Its really easy to get wowed. We live in the society of the first impression. If you can make a great first impression. If you can put together a great resume. If you can have a great interview, you can go a long way. We can learn how to fool people faster. We make decisions that actually breed the opposite of integrity, and make a person more dangerous.  And the journey to integrity begins and ends with humility. You want to be an enemy of God, hold on to your pride. You can make it romantic when you look back, but there's a lot of things in life that aren't romantic when your doing them. You know, like cleaning floors, cleaning bathrooms, or stacking chairs. We will never become the person God wants us to be until we humble ourselves and recognize that we're not too good to do anything. God opposes the proud but he gives grace to the humble. But as long as we are trying to lift ourselves up he presses us downward and as long as you keep trying to push yourself up God will keep making sure that you are pressed down. But if you live a life that pushes downward God will lift you up.  I love Joby's song that says "there's no place low enough to go". What an increadible imagery that when you are coming into the presence of God there is no place you can go low enough to properly align yourself in the presence of God. You hear the opposite when you hear people say things like, "Well me and God, we our own agreement. Well, me and God we have our own understanding." We resist the words like forgiveness, mercy, like repentence. All those imply that we have to humble ourselves. Because you cannot come to the relationship with God through Jesus Christ without a moment of genuine humility. If you just go "oh Jesus I believe in you and I give you my heart" and all that, that's not going to cut it. The road to becoming a follower of God is to come to that place in your life where you are depressed. You are pressed to the ground and you say "God there is nowhere lower I can go!"  Christianity is born out of humility. Doesn't it make sense that the way it begins is the way its supposed to continue. How do I know if I am living a life of humility in front of God. Well, are you obeying what the scriptures say or are you only obeying the stuff you like? We apply the stuff that we percieve we need and we ignore the stuff that irritates us and goes against our own desires. Humility is obeying the truth of God when you understand it not when you feel like it. Has it ever occured to you that there are things God wants to do through your life that he might not be able to begin until you come to a place of humility where you trust in his power?

      This past Wednesday evening to Saturday afternoon I found myself in Las Vegas for the first time in my life.  What an experience as my mind wondered about such a place and how it even existed; an oasis of hotels and casinos in the middle of a desert.  A place full of desperate people, filling themselves with things that do not satisfy.  It was great to see family and to take in the new sites. In memory of my vacation and the laughter that was unending I have developed of list of the Top Ten Things I Learned in Las Vegas:  10. I smoked a pack of cigarettes just walking around. 9.   1000 to 1 : Ratio of naked lady images to naked guy images. 8.   Old ladies LOVE slot machines. 7.   I look older. (I never got carded-people usually think I'm 16-18) 6.   Some adults never leave adolesence. 5.   Wash your hands. 4.   You can play electronic nickel poker for a really long time and still lose you money. 3.   Some people carry beer in their back pocket. 2.   No one said I couldn't remove naked lady cards that were stuck in the fences. 1.   An unpaid intern has no business being in Las Vegas.

      I'm currently sitting in the Apple Store at a ritzy mall off the Santa Monica Freeway (aka. the 10) and feeling very low class in my t-shirt and jeans.  There is something crazy going on with my screen display for no apparent reason.  My trusted Mac friend, Chris, suggested I get it taken care of right away.  I'm a bit nevous about having something potentially wrong with my great new purchase.  I'm in line at the Genius Bar (aka. mac's fix-it station) patiently waiting my turn, so I thought I would catch up on some writing. It has been kind of a crazy last week, hence the me not writing so much.  Actually, I was in Las Vegas for 4 days this past week visiting some family that were there on vacation (for the blog of my trip see Las Vegas Top Ten blog).  I'm currently working on more project with Mosaic.  Jason (another intern) and I are helping start a small group in downtown LA with Antonio.  Antonio goes to Mosaic and Jason and I are basically here to assist him in getting things started.  Our goal is to make sure we put in enough effort so that the group lasts beyond the summer when we are gone (maybe if I'm gone).  I just finished a book review for Eric (the young adult pastor) called Twentysomething: surving and thriving in the real world (see blog on Twentysomething).  I'm also helping put together an overnight retreat called The Portal.  The purpose of the retreat is to learn to hear God through the scriptures.  Peter (an intern) and I are getting together this week to put some details together.  Peter will be a senior at Taylor.  We were in school together, in the same major, knew some of the same people, but met in LA.    Last night after church and clean up, I went out with some people.  Actually, this group goes out every Sunday after the     5:00 service to hang out, and sometimes it's not cheap.  Okay, it's never cheap.  Last night especially.  We went to a hotel called The Standard in downtown LA.  We ate at the restaraunt there ($7 for hummus and pita bread, it was good though) and proceeded to the rooftop where there was a bar and a small dance floor.  Talk about a new experience.  I will begin with the atmosphere.  The rooftop was fulll of twentysomethings out for a good ol' time on a Sunday night.  That's right, in case you thought living it up was only for Thursday, Friday and Saturday, you better think again.  Usually there is a $20 cover to get up on the top, but Sundays are free.  Complete with bar, dance floor, swimming pool and several small vibrating water beds (I know, I didn't ask) this was like no other rooftop I had ever seen...not that I'm a rooftop expert.  Too many people for me to be comfortable (much like church is sometimes), I found myself standing by the railing and looking out on a beautiful view of Los Angeles.  It beats being lost in a sea of strangers.  Mike (an intern) came over and we chatted it up for a bit about meeting people and the courage it takes.  I admired his people skills and the way he seems to easily connect with many different people.  We've been here the same amount of time and I feel like I don't know anybody, and he knows everybody.  He told it was a learned skill and that he was always a shy person.  It was good to talk to him and encouraging to know that there is hope for me to not be such an introvert in big crowds.  Besides, how do I tell people about my journey, about Christ, without even approaching them?  We talked for a while over the techno beats coming from the dj and enjoyed the night.  I was very much ready for bed when I finally got there.  Today is my Sabbath and so I'm taking care of ordering my life and just spending time in the quiet.  Trying to connect with more with him who made me.  Marveling again at his patience.

      James 3:1-12  “What if at the end of every day, God gave you a manuscript of all the things you said that day and required you to read it? We would begin to make every word count.”  -your words contain the power to create and the power to destroy  -we will be held accountable for the result of our influence on the lives of others  -we are creatures of influence; we are all shaped by the influence of others whether for good or bad  -What one word has had the most influence on you?  -embrace the words God has spoken into your life  -God desires us to speak hope, peace and future into people’s lives  -language has exponential potential  -have you ever said something to hurt someone a little bit, but instead it cut right through their heart?  -your words give you a good idea of how much control you have over yourself  -whatever you begin to say about yourself will be true; our words shape the reality in which we live  -DO YOU BELIEVE YOUR DREAMS ARE POSSIBLE?  -one word spoken into someone’s life can steer the direction of that person’s life, whether hope, encouragement, disappointment or death  -in the end you will not be able to tame your tongue because your words reflect your deep spiritual condition  -SPEAK LIFE. MAKE EVERY WORD COUNT. OUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT.

      It is now almost a week since last Sunday, and I find myself scraping to recall all of what I wanted to remember and write down.  I’m pretty sure I’m not going to remember.  The passage was James 2:14-26 and the proverb was “Believe in Action”.  This was a really hard hitting message about how faith and works cannot be separated.  Faith is an action word.  Faith cannot exist apart from action.  Some notes:  -if James were living today, he would certainly separate between the religion of Christianity and the true followers of Christ  -when you “have faith” you feel good about God; we’ve made it a spiritual version of emotions; when you confirm the right things about God, you “have faith” BUT FAITH IS NEITHER COGNITION OR EMOTION  -reality for God is what we create with our lives faith always creates action  -faith is not what you have organized in your brain (ahhh, one of those moments when you know someone is speaking directly to you; I need to hear this one)  -there is an inseparable relationship between your connection with God and your connection with people  -our actions in the end betray us, and in the end you will do what you believe  -relationships prove your connection to God; relationships are where the rubber meets the road, where “faith” is shown for what it is  -Abraham and Rahab had absolute confidence in the character of God; you cannot live a life of faith without absolute confidence in God’s character

      My first big project at Mosaic was to put together the LA Tour, a trip to different spiritual centers around the city, in order to gain a better understanding of the spiritual and cultural diversity of Los Angeles.  Saturday (6.19) was the day it all came together.  We met at Macarthur Park at 10:00 am…well, sort of.  Unbeknownst to me, Macarthur Park is apparently a place where you can buy crack any time of day (or whatever your choice of drug).  It seemed friendly enough, but I guess looks can be deceiving.  Shoot, it’s LA.  Nothing is what it seems.  So we began the day with people wondering why we were meeting there and also not being able to find it. Eventually we all came together at about 10:30 am.  By 10:45 we were on our way to the Zen Buddhist Center where I had scheduled us to have a tour of their facility.  Jaime (Spanish pronunciation, “hi-may”) is one of the youth pastor’s at Mosaic and he was my help for the day.  Since he has lived in LA for 10 years, he was a great source of information.  I had printed off driving directions for all of the drivers, but we didn’t leave from the spot from where I had planned all the directions (Macarthur Park) because we ended up having to meet people elsewhere who couldn’t find the park.  So from the get go, everything was off a bit, which I am learning is typical Mosaic fashion.  It all comes together in the end.  We needed to get going and I didn’t know how to get to the Zen Center from where we were, so I said to Jaime, “do you know how to get to the Zen Buddhists Center?”  He’s said yes and for me and everyone else to follow him.  So I did.  Ten minutes later we were on the 60 heading east (aka. Away from downtown; every stop I had planned was downtown so we wouldn’t have much driving to do).  Come to find out, Jaime was taking us to the largest Buddhist temple in North America, located in Hacienda Heights, California (a suburb of LA).  However, that’s not where I set up the tour.  We were all ready well on our way and so we continued on.  I called the other temple and apologized profusely.  Hopefully that relationship isn’t too damaged.    Stepping into this house of worship was quite an experience.  I’ve never actually seen people in the act of worship other than Christians.  To see many devout followers come and bow before the Buddha and bring their offerings was quite disturbing.  My discernment was on high alert.  Although it was disturbing, one thing has rested with me since then, and that is the reverence with which Buddhists come to worship.  All is quiet in the temple.  Reflective. Contemplative.  Reverent. As I think about this I wonder why such reverence isn’t shown in most of our Christian houses of worship.  So, as happens often, I began to think about that.  First of all, as the body of Christ, “WE are God’s field, God’s temple.  It is in the hearts of men and women in which God resides, not in the building.  Our problem with reverence has less to do with the lack of a quiet, contemplative atmosphere of the structure in which the Church gathers and more to do with the reverence of the heart as it bows before its Creator.  Our lives are to be reverent…how hard is that!  Nonetheless, this is what we are to strive for.  As for quiet contemplation, it is certainly of great value, as is an atmosphere of reverence.  But I just wanted to note something about our God. He likes to be celebrated, and he likes it loud.  I just finished reading 2 Chronicles 5-6.  In these chapters the author tells of the finishing touches that are being put on Solomon’s temple and the ceremony of its dedication.  What commotion! What hoopla! Read it, and see if you don’t get excited!  He is not a God of chaos, but he is a God of celebration.            Praise God that he loves variety in worship.  That we don’t always have to tiptoe in silence, take our shoes off (although a good practice sometimes) or bow many times over.  Praise God that he loves dancing, singing, shouting and sweet sweet melodies!  We may feel free to approach him in whatever way our hearts so desire, whether in silence or in shouts.

      After church last Sunday, I moved from where I was living in Diamond Bar to downtown Los Angeles, namely USC (personally, I’m partial to the TU Trojans).  I live in campus housing in an apartment complex called Troy (is there a theme here?)  I’m living with a couple and there 6 month old daughter who enjoys a good cry.  Lora works for USC and supervises some of the dorms and Grant is a producer for The Average Joe.  He will be on location in August at an undisclosed location under penalty of breaching a 2 million dollar confidentiality contract.  And if I didn’t know it before, I know it now: I live in LA.  It seems like everyone really is in “the business” and the cliché that “everyone is writing a screen play” isn’t far from the truth.  Their apartment is designed to house 5-6 students, therefore, I have my own sleeping room and my own bathroom.  It’s a pretty sweet gig considering that I’m living there for free.  The first few days have been interesting, navigating my way from parking meter to parking meter.  There are only certain times you can park on certain sides of the streets and for a certain number of hours at a time.  I will be getting a parking permit soon so that I can go directly to a lot.  It is definitely going to take some getting use to.  Diamond Bar is pretty much suburb-ish, nice, quiet and family friendly.  Los Angeles is a full-fledged city, complete with miles of concrete and constant noise.  I basically live in a place that is completely opposite from anything I’ve known.  Living in Minneapolis is as close as I can compare to living in LA, and that is not saying much.  So, cheers!  Here’s to more learning adventures!

      Wednesday morning, we joined together at 3:30 am, prepared to participate in an adventure we knew little about. By 5:00 am we were at the foot of great hill/small mountain which would begin to climb.  The purpose: see the sunrise over all of LA, from the hills in Pasadena to the beach in Santa Monica, to see "the strong man, running its course with joy" (Ps 19:1-6).  Well, truth be told, it was completely cloudy all day long.  So we made the hike (2 miles) up the mountain where we watched the fog rise instead and talked about our magnificent Creator and our own capacity to create as those who have been formed in his image.  The hike was rough for me, and rather unexpected.  But I made it to the top, one of the last two but just glad to have persevered.  This day would be about me pushing through.  We traveled back down the mountain three times as fast as we had climbed it, piled back in our cars and headed for the beach.  It is a privilege to be so near both the mountains and the ocean, to see just a glimpse of the breadth of God's creation.  We came to Portuguese Bin, a rocky beach and a quite unknown area.  The rocks were large and smooth, a result of being refined over time in the salt water of the Pacific.  They were an array of blue, from light to deep with any number of patterns to them.  Our task here was to, on our own, pick out what we thought was the most beautiful rock and what we thought was the ugliest rock.  The beautiful rock was to represent all the good that resided in us.  The things we loved about ourselves.  The gifts, talents and other generosities of our hearts.  This rock was to be thrown back to the ocean, where it would continue its refinement.  The ugly rock represented all that is holding us back from moving forward with God.  Our fear, doubts.  Our past.  Whatever is consuming our thoughts and hearts.  This rock was to be thrown into the ocean as well, into the hands of God, to be consumed by his all powerful love.  Off of our shoulders and onto his.  For me, this exercise was key for what would happen next, for without naming my rocks and tossing them to the sea I would not have done what challege came next.  We moved from the more open part of the beach to the bottom of a small cliff that overlooked the ocean.  Here we bounded over larger and more jagged rocks to a cove that the water had carved into the side of the cliff.  Here, the blue and green waves pounded against the rocks in a most dramatic fashion.  It is hard to describe with words what the scene was like, but I will do my best.  In between two plateaus of rocks, the ocean rolled into the cove.  Next thing we knew, our leader was in the water between the two plateaus.  Grabbing a hold of some seaweed, he lifted himself up the not so smooth rocks on the other side (mind you it is cloudy and cool-in the upper 60s maybe).  He stood on the other side, the water dividing us from him and challenged us to come across.  He made it clear that is was not necessary that we do this, but the offer was there to see the beautiful view from the other side.  Immediately I wanted to do it.  Anyone who knows me well enough knows that this desire was out of character.  I don't even like the beach that much.  I rarely go into the ocean.  I'm not really into being wet.  But something in me said, "Adria, you need to do this.  Kick a side of your box down today.  Break out.  Face your fears and live."  We were instructed to bring a swimsuit for this such occasion.  But me being me, I didn't bring one.  How often would I really go to the beach? (I've been twice in a week and a half) So, I moved to LA without a swimsuit.  People have done crazier things.  I knew I had a change of clothes, but I didn't have a towel.  For the first time, it didn't matter.  Before my mind new what my heart was doing, I was out of my Birkenstocks and into the cold Pacific on a cold, cloudy day with all of my clothes on, grabbing onto seaweed and David's (our leader) hand and pulling myself up to the other side.  Our adventure was just beginning.  We traveled along the second plateau and came to a cove similar to the first. What else was there to do?  We jumped in again.  Some of the guys bodies took quite a beating on the rocks as they helped the girls climb up to the other side.  Let's be honest, this wasn't the safest thing to be doing, and people bled.  I had won. We had won a small battle, and we all felt a little like barbarians.  Erwin would have been proud (his forthcoming book is called "The Barbarian Way")  Going into the water twice meant we had to do it two more times in order to get back to the rest of our party.   So we did, enjoying our new found camaraderie and the courage to "jump first, fear later" (Michael Yaconelli).  The day ended with a feast that David's wife had prepared at their home in Whittier, and I don't believe I have ever been so grateful for food, or the hammock I was able to rest my bones in.  We were beat, but our hearts were light within us.  After debriefing our day around the fire, we ended with desert; a most proper finish.   In my entire life, I don't think I have ever been as sore as I am today.  Leaps of faith, risks, these do not come without sacrifice.  My body has paid the price for my hearts freedom.    "Safe!? Of course he isn't safe! But he's good."  -Mr. Beaver about Aslan (C.S.

      Life in Church is held every so often at the McManus' house.  Here, Erwin and others from the Mosaic lead team speak about the core values and convictions of Mosaic.  Life in Church is one step in the process of becoming volunteer staff (known elsewhere as "membership").  It was a great evening as we shared a meal together (extremely authentic Mexican food made some ladies in the church) and talked about the mission of Christ.  Again, here are my notes:  I. What's in a name? MOSAIC  -a piece of art made of broken and fragmented pieces of glass that form a beautiful image -broken people who know they need God, the master artist -democrats, republicans, multi-cultural, rich, poor (Mosaic is a mini-LA)  II. What's in a church? PURPOSE  -2 expression [1 Cor 12:12-13, 27; Eph 6:10-13]  *body *army  -2 responsibilities [1 Cor 12:7; Gal 5:13]  *minister *mobilize  -2 results [Acts 2:42-47]  *united *expanding  -2 structures [Acts 20:20]  *large *small  III. What makes us unique? APOSTOLIC ETHOS  ethos: the defining characteristics and distinguishing attitudes held by individuals as passed through there community  the mission: to live by faith, to be known by love, and to be a voice of hope  IV. Soul Environment: 5 Core Values (non-negotiables)  1. MISSION IS WHY THE CHURCH EXISTS   -every follower of Jesus is commissioned by God -the most natural way to nurture people is to get them on mission with Jesus -from the beginning every believer has all they need to be a missionary  2. LOVE IS THE CONTEXT OF ALL MISSION -the natural flow of the life of Jesus is through relationships -"I hate Christianity, but I like this church so much that I don't know what to do with my hate." [a comment from an attendee)  3. STRUCTURE MUST ALWAYS SUBMIT TO SPIRIT -we are not twigs, we are branches  -the Spirit of God lives in people -the number 1 predictor of whether or not you will be at Mosaic in a year is if you are serving other with others -healing comes through serving  4. RELEVANCE TO CULTURE IS NOT OPTIONAL -create an environment that makes people say "Okay, this makes sense to me. This relates to my experience in the world." -minister to the culture of ADD -create anticipation and astonishment; make people afraid to miss an irreplaceable experience  5. CREATIVITY IS A NATURAL RESULT OF SPIRITUALITY -every person has the capacity for creativity -imaginations, dreams--they have a high level of importance -God did not give us an imagination to dream about things we will never experience -human beings will choose to live like machines -creativity and artistry are not the same -in the body of Christ creativity is unleashed and magnified

      Good morning, Lord.  Thank you for another day.  Another opportunity to move forward with you. May I use this day for unprecedented joy in the hope of your glory.  Move me, even if only one small step, closer to your mission.  Draw me into your healing, into your promises.  I choose to believe in you today.  I choose to obey your commands and when I do not, I choose to come to you for forgiveness.  I choose not to fear the darkness and gloom, nor to entertain the enemy's lies.  I choose to fight.  I choose to be dependent upon your body, upon those you have placed around me.  I choose to meet the needs of others and to be willing to have my own needs met.  I choose to be true to who you have made me to be and not to desire someone else's life.  I choose to forgive others.  I choose to forgive myself.  I choose to conquer.  I choose to live.   "No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.  For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord."  -Romans 8:37-39

      These notes are from my weekly meetings on Monday's with all of the other interns and other people from Mosaic. This weeks topic: HOW TO CREATE COMMUNITY (this is just a list, but there was more discussion and Bible study behind it that I couldn't get written down and I can't rehash it right now because I'm very tired:)  10 NECESSITIES TO CREATE EVANGELISTIC SMALL GROUPS:  1. Cause creates community-KNOW YOUR PURPOSE 2. Find your team     -believers     -non-believers you have built some sort of relationship with     -find people of peace who may not be believers, but who are not hostile 3. Find a place     -make it consistant 4. Start inviting people along with your team (recruiting) 5. What do you do?     -relational AND spiritual (it is detrimental to err on either side)     -the goal of the leader is to get people to participate     -cause AND community 6. A place where needs are met     -if 8 people come to have their needs met, no ones needs are met     -if 8 people come to meet the needs of other, everyone's needs are met 7. A springboard into relationships outside of the group 8. Create opportunities for others to serve 9. Recognize that it's all about Jesus (I Cor. 4:20 "For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of talk but of power." 10. Move people closer to the mission of Christ  I'm working on beginning a Life Group (Mosaic terminology) at USC (University of Souther California, the Trojans) with another intern next week.  Experience is the greatest teacher.

      "Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation, and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.  For the sun rises with its scorching heart and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes.  So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits."  James 1:9-11  Economic status was the order of the day at Mosaic.  After running the camera for the first and second services/celebrations today, I was able to take notes during the final one at 5:00 pm.  This week's Ancient Proverb in Modern Times was "Play Your Position".   Based on this passage from James, pastor Erwin began his sermon with a little history on the Protestant and Catholic wars in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from where he and his family returned last week.  He had a speaking engagement there to celebrate the Day of Pentecost. He explained how the wars are/were not so much due to differences in theology, but differences in economic status.    Here are more notes from my journal.  I'm running the camera for both of the morning celebrations now, and I'm doing other things during the evening celebration, so if my notes seem to jump around, don't worry...I still know what they mean:)  They'll just seem scattered to you.  Feel free to ask questions.  -the purpose of Jesus Christ is not to make us affluent and wealthy -as Christians, we are all born into different economic statuses -step into poverty with responsibility/step into wealth with responsibility -poverty creates the environment for great faith in God's provision -don't get lost in the wanting/don't get trapped in the having -poverty is a lack of opportunity of another choice (I'm more and more grateful to be here everyday; my life is rich with opportunity) -REDEMPTION AND LIFT    *sociologists don't believe in Christ, but they believe in Christianity, because Christianity breaks the cycle of          poverty    *an person in poverty who comes to know Christ might not change their economic status within their lifetime, but within 2 generations their heirs will find themselves in a completely different economic status    *Christianity breeds responsibility -do not abdicate your responsibility with wealth -maximize your opportunities of being born to privilege  In summary: Play Your Position  (and yes, there were more fortune cookies this week)

      Today, Jen took me around to talk to people at other spiritual centers in the LA area.  I needed to get on the ball with planning the LA Tour, which will happen next Satruday.  The limits of my comfort zone were certainly pushed today.  My task was to go to these places and see if they would be willing to give us a tour of their facilities, explain their beliefs a bit and answer questions for about 20 people from Mosaic.  Three things that stretched me: forcing myself to meet and greet new people, to take initiative in setting up the tours and the face to face reality that people worship and trust in other gods, whether it is Buddha, Allah or the self. Our first stop today was at the Zen Center of Los Angeles, a Buddhist haven.  There, we met with Cohen, who has been at the center since the early 70s.   An extremely friendly man, he was glad to set up a time for next weekend on such short notice.  The second stop we made was at a Muslim mosque, but they didn't come to the door when we rang.  They must have been closed for some reason.  Our third stop was a the Church of Scientology, where Melanie gave Jen and I our own tour.  I've been intrigued by this "religion" for a while, not knowing much about it.  It is not so much religion, from what I understand, as it is the sheer practice of humanism (elevating man to the highest supremecy).  They worship the self.  Much of Scientology is very scientific and concrete.  They stress healthing living, social justice, and a common sense approach to living life.  It is the non-religious religion of commen sense, if you will.  Scientology is also a religion inside of a religion.  Christian are welcome. Buddhists are welcome. Muslims are welcome.  Atheists are welcome.  Scientology can be practiced under any umbrella of personal belief.  It will not breach or violate a personal belief, unless the parishoner chooses to let it do so. There may be more to come as I find out more about it.  Next we visited the Self-Realization Fellowship, which is oddly enough located right next door (literally) to the Church of Scientology,  I do not know much about this belief, except that it has something to do with Yoga, which is named after its founder.  I will find out more this week.  Our last stop was at the Kabbalah Center in Beverly Hills.  No one came to the door when we rang, and after ringing again and waiting we realized it was the Jewish Sabbath.  A good long laugh followed.   It was a great day of driving through the city, seeing the culturally and enthnically different areas of Los Angeles.  People are so different, but we are all essentially the same.  Young or old, male or female, rich or poor, we are all searching for something.  We are questioning, longing and pursuing something to fill us.  We seek something to give our lives meaning and fullness. We all long to be whole.

      For any of you who aren't aware, there is a movie out right now entitle "Saved!"  It a satire on Christianity, specifically geared toward the happenings of a Christian High School.  Ever since I read about this film in RELEVANT Magazine I've been anxiously awaiting its release.  I went to a matinee of it yesterday afternoon and was not disappointed.    Now before I begin to write a bit of my thoughts on this film, let me say that it will most certainly not be for everyone.  It is at points a harsh criticism, not of all Christians but of many.  It generalizes, as many criticism do, to make a point.  Last thing before I jump into some of my thoughts about it. Consider this a disclaimer: IF YOU SEE THIS MOVIE BE SURE THAT IT IS CLEAR IN YOUR HEAD THAT THIS IS SATIRE. Love does not easily take offense.  We would do well to pay attention to how Christians are perceived, satire or not.    The movie begins with Mary, a high school junior, describing her perfect Christian life. The story follows her into her summer where she spends time hanging out with her perfect Christian boyfriend, who mid-summer tells her that he is gay.  After seeking spiritual guidance, Mary decides that in order to save Dean from his abomination, Jesus has told her to sleep with him.  Mary enters her senior year at this Christian high school pregnant with a gay guy's baby.  Throughout the rest of the movie we see the goings on of this Christian high school, from smoking, swearing and sex to spiritual rallies and prayer meetings (all of which happen at Christian schools, high school or college, I went to one).   The characters range from the bad Jewish girl to Hillary Faye (the most spiritual, beautiful and popular girl in school) and her lemming-like followers.  Ironically enough those who do not necessarily believe are those who are most like Jesus.  And those who talk about him the most have the least capacity to love.    There are definitely parts of this film that are hard to watch.  I found myself wondering if I should laugh at some of the things that really were quite funny.  But, the truth is funny, and Christians are sometimes very very stupid and blind.  Myself included.  Although we may not find ourselves acting this way to the extent portrayed in the movie, I was able to take in the message and understand that my life does indeed sometimes reflect the themes.  There are also ideas that seem very relativistic, but I would challenge everyone who sees this movie to dig deeper into the statements made and pull out the truth.  At the same time, there is very much truth in this film, very profound truth.  So, as Dr. Helyer always told us at Taylor, "Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater."  Watch this film with an open mind, a thinking mind, and a heart of love for its creators.    That's all I'm going to write because I want you all to see it for yourselves. I know most of you well enough to know that this movie won't be for all of you.  I can't make that call.  If you are unsure and you want to see it anyway, make sure you go into it with the right mind and heart set.  I apologize beforehand if any of you see it and are royally offended.  Feel free to comment on my comments after you see it, and certainly feel free to disagree.  I'm probably going to see it again with the interns from Mosaic, just to let it sink in more and form a better opinion of it.    Oh, and one more thing...IT IS ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS!  May we never be found throwing our Bibles at someone and screaming "I am filled with the love of Christ!"  Peace :)  [my ticket said it was rated PG and I don't see how; consider it PG-13]

      Today was my first day at the Mosaic office as an intern, where I was given some projects to begin working on.  I will be the point person for was is called LA Tour.  Basically, LA Tour is a (non-comprehensive) spiritual overview of the Los Angeles area.  We will most likely make visits to a Buddhist Temple, an Islamic Mosque, and a Hindu community to learn more about these religions, the people that practice them, and how to reach those lost in their allure. I'm looking into adding a visit to a Kabbalah center in there too.  Anyway, I'm in charge of recruiting people to help me with the details and setting up the tour.  A group of interns from Germany are coming to LA for a couple of weeks and I'm scheduling the tour so that they can attend.  So, a 23 year old girl from Mooresville, IN is taking Germans around LA for an educational look at other religious followings of the city.  Who knew, indeed?!  I'm also working on putting college age people into life groups according to their location in and around LA.    Tonight some of the other interns and I watched the children of the Mosaic lead team while they were having a get together at the McManus house.  Since I still haven't changed much, I was more interested in the seemingly unending amount of books in the house rather than the children.  Shocker.  The room with most of the books was the room with the TV as well, and the walls are decorated with movie posters in foreign language (and a few in English).  Braveheart, Mission Impossible, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Last samurai, to name a few.  Cool room.  I eventually found myself on the floor playing a German boardgame with two German/Brazilian boys, Adrian and Tony (I can't imagine being tri-lingual at 5 years old).  They were wonderful, pleasant boys...Clearly not American:)  I spent sometime talking with there mother.  She and her husband (who is Brazilian and in Germany at the moment) have been in the States for almost a year as interns at Mosaic.  They are planting a Mosaic church in Germany in the fall.  It was amazing to hear the stories of how the two of them met and ended up at Mosaic.  He was doing work at a German missions organization in Kenya (being from Brazil) and the Germans there got him to come visit Germany where he taught at a missions school attended by Andrea (his wife).  They pastored a church in Germany and went on live for a while in Brazil where there sons learned Portuguese.  They went to Minneapolis to look at the structure of some churches there, looking for something new and fresh to bring back with them to Germany.  They were disappointed in what they found, but eventually wound up at Bethel Seminary where they shared there testimony.  Erwin was in the crowd listening that day.  He talked to them, they came to LA, and then moved to LA for a year.  Remarkable.   An amazing, peaceful evening in SoCal.

      The Summit is the life group that I will be a part of every Monday evening.  At six o'clock the interns will meet for intern "stuff" and then at eight o'clock anyone can come and join the group.  This Monday we went though what the Character Matrix is (copyright 1985 Erwin Raphael McManus).  MAKING WHOLE DISCIPLES OUT OF BROKEN PEOPLE:  The First Journey [pride to courage]  PRIDE: self-focus HUMILITY: the willingness to serve the needs of others above oneself INTEGRITY: one can be entrusted with followers COURAGE: the absence of self, NOT the absence of fear  The Second Journey [foolishness to wisdom]  FOOLISHNESS: a dog returns to its vomit FAITHFULNESS: small commitments build a faithful life PERSEVERANCE: do it when you say you'll do it, and there is also grace WISDOM: making right decisions repeatedly  The Third Journey [greed to generosity]  GREED: an insatiable desire for more (when Erwin's children complain about something that doesn't seem "good enough" or about circumstances, he will ask them "what do you deserve?" The learned response is "nothing" whether they believe it or not; one guys took a step towards reality and had his kids say "death and hell" :) GRATITUDE: being thankful for what you have an not angry about what you don't WHOLENESS: giving more than you demand or receive GENEROSITY: giving without the thought of receiving  Out of these three journeys comes a person of courage, wisdom, and generosity.

      Erwin is preaching though the book of James right now in a series called Ancient Proverbs for Modern Times.  Upon entering the building (Los Angeles Entertainment Center), those in attendance were brought into the atmosphere filled with Chinese ambiance.  Chinese fans and other decor were place strategically in the building, while music that one might hear in a Chinese restaurant played in the background (unless, of course, you are at the Chinese restaurant in Gas City where they play Britney Spears).  Oh yes, and also upon entering everyone was given a fortune cookie to be used in the service.   Erwin broke open the scriptures and read from James 1:2-8, focusing on 5-8:  "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach,a nd it will be given him.  But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.  For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord.  He is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways."  Here are some of my notes:  -until you know that you don't deserve a relationship with God, you won't get one -God does not hold us to a standard when we ask for wisdom, he simply gives; it is not a one time gift, but one that we must continually ask for, knowing that without it or with our own human wisdom, we become foolish (example: Solomon's faults; he wasn't always wise) -you were created to have a continual conversation with the Creator fo the universe; the things you want in this life will never happen without this continuous conversation -ASK THEN ACT; to doubt is to hesitate, withdrawal or disconnect;  when God gives wisdom ACT in accordance with that wisdom; you can see the path of wisdom and yet choose the path of a fool -God is comfortable with a level of uncertainty that we are not; he makes things clear ENOUGH -double-minded = double-souled (it must be God's desires and his only) - What is one thing/fear you need to face in order to move forward with God?  2 BATTLE CRIES:  "Forward!"                           "Fight for the heart of the king!"  At the end of Erwin's speaking, he had us all open our fortune cookies and read them aloud at the same time.  They all said, "Face your fears and live."

      Today’s travels brought us through the rest of New Mexico and on into Arizona. We found our way through the Petrified Forest and the Painted Desert, stopped at the Sweet Pea Cafe for lunch and drove on to the Grand Canyon.  The drive was continuously beautiful and continually desolate.  And for most of the drive there was a single cloud in the sky.  Yep, just one.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Mom forgot she was driving a stick shift at one of the exits. Killed it again :) It was another extravagation.  Now, on with the Grand Canyon.  All of Arizona really.  It is so amazing that its hard to even try to describe it.  Words like awsome, beautiful, and amazing do not carry enough meaning in them to justly describe the sight.  Silence, in this case, is the greatest compliment that can be given to the Creator. I’ve been thinking about how I’m on my way to the opposite of the places I’ve been driving through.  Vast desert will soon be replaced by miles and miles of concrete and millions of people.  I’m soaking up the silence.  Yet I am at the same time looking forward to the newness of Los Angeles, looking forward to a change.  It is not Los Angeles in itself that is exciting.  It is not the fame, the industry, the glamor.  It is not the beach or the weather (dry heat is definitely an extra bonus), and it is certainly not city life.  It is Jesus that excites me.  It is what he is up to, of which I have no idea, that excites me.  It is indeed the experience. All I know is that Los Angeles, California is where I need to be.  This is where I need to learn for a season, however long it lasts. Jesus had to make time for solitude.  He had to make time late at night or early in the morning.  This was a part of his greater sacrifice and it will have to be a discipline that I too take a hold of.  He was surrounded by crowds, noise and much of the hedonism and paganism of the Roman Empire, and within this realm he declared, “I am the light of the world”. So it is with me, and I shall point to him. No, living in Los Angeles in not my “American dream”, but I don’t really have one of those anyway.   Andrew asked Jesus, “Where do you live?”, and Jesus replied “Come and see”.  Like Andrew, I have chosen to follow him and see, and my home in this world will be wherever he leads. For now, Jesus wants me to see where he lives in Los Angeles, and to see what he can do with this broken vessel.    Quotes for the day:  “And the mountains sing your glory, hallelujah.    The canyons echo sweet amazing grace.   My spirit sails the mighty gails are bellowing your name,   And I’ve got nothing to say.   I’ve got nothing to say.    Hey Jamie would you mind driving down this road awhile?   Arizona’s caught me by surprise.”  						-Andrew Peterson  “Inhale the nations. Exhale the gospel.”  						-Erwin Raphael McManus

      If there was one Monday night intern meeting we were all stoked about this was it.  It was the meeting to end all meetings.  Three hours of Q and A with Erwin.  Here are some of my notes.  The discussion was way faster than we all could write.  Knowing that beforehand, we video taped it.  So I will also have an audio CD of it and a DVD.  For now, here are the notes from my journal:  CHALLENGES HE IS FACING RIGHT NOW IN MINISTRY   "I live for challenges." logistics his approach to ministry is always a positive and not a long-term risk to the Mosaic community planting churches in every major city in the world changing what Christians are known for   PERSONAL SPIRITUAL VIBRANCY  "I spend an immense amount of time in my imagination." an ongoing conversation with God "I know who you are by what you accomplish, not by what you think."   WHAT WOULD MOSAIC BE WITHOUT YOU?  a classic/normal contemporary church "Mosaic is not reactionary to the modern church, I am."  PREACHING   what does this passage say about the character of God? humanity? preaching should change the way you see reality "I heard God say, 'If you preach, I'll meet you there.'" create a language that makes sense to people without God "More than anything else, serve people with humility." "Earn the right to be heard wherever you go." "Listen, a lot, to people who are not committed to you." "Listen to voices that are shaping people's thinking."  MORALITY  an action that causes a human being to be healthy immorality is that which causes a human being to be unhealthy  LIFE  "People who look rich usually aren't." "We can live deep and exciting lives." "Fill your heart and mind with truths from the Scriptures." "Christianity is all about connecting to the heart of God." "If you don't ask questions or have questions you've shut off your brain; if you don't have doubts you're not asking deep enough questions; the more you walk with God the more questions you have." "You cannot allow Satan to speak into your life and tell you that you are going to have a hand-me-down life." (to a girl around my age who has already been divorced) "You cannot live out the Scriptures outside of biblical community." "Who in the world can your heart break for?" "Tragedies of the past can make you think you have no right to enjoy life." "If you have caused the tragedy, you must make restitution." "Positive experiences create new memories." "The church does not exist for believers.  We are the church, and we exist for the world."  TO ME IN RESONSE TO THE QUESTION OF BEING OVERWHELMED BY THE PROSPECT OF CHANGING THE WORLD  It's good that you want to change the world.  Don't lose that.  You are in like 1% of the population who wakes up and wants to change the world.  "Don't grow old." "Don't short change any one act of faithfulness." "Change the world somewhere.  Start somewhere."

      One of the best sermons I've ever heard:  What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you? You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask. You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions. You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, “He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us”? But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, “God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”  Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.  Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.  Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.  Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge. There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?  James 4:1-12  -we don't know how to have meaningful conflict and still be on the same side -we have to fight the right enemy and fight for the right cause -the more you understand who you are the higher the risk can be that you will creat conflict -do you keep wanting things that destroy you? -God will not join you, you have to join him -we want God to meet our desires instead of changing our desires -the world James is talking about is inside of us, not outside of us; James says nothing about the outside world -God gets involved when we cry out in desperation, but that isn't the way to live a healthy life -sin equals everything that demeans the character of God and who you were created to be -one of the problems with Christians is we don't love anyone in the world out there -people are not the enemy, people are the treasure -YOU HAVE TO WIN THE COSMIC CONFLICT INSIDE OF YOUR SOUL -when you make God the ultimate object of your desires, God changes your desires and meets them -PROACTIVE ACTION: submit, resist, draw near, cleanse, purify, change, humble yourself, do not speak evil (4-11) -the person who waits for God to do a miracle rarely sees it, but the person who moves with proactive action sees more of God's miraculous intervention -one reason we don't invite God into our lives is because we are doing and desiring things he's not pleased with -humility is an inclination towards "yes" -do not ask for clarity in the future until you can walk wth clarity in the present

      Once a month, Mosaic has a meeting at the McManus's that they call Life in Church.  This is one of the steps in becoming volunteer staff at Mosaic (aka. membership).  All of the interns have been privileged to go and find out more about Mosaic's core values and mission.  Last night was Josh and Elizabeth's turn to go, and Josh asked me to babysit...................[moment of silence for that to sink in and for you to laugh].  Josh and Elizabeth have two daughters, Gracie (2) and Ellie (1).  You can find them in the picture below.  Now, normally I am good at turning down offers to babysit, and if any of you have seen me around children, you know it is probably for the best that I do.  There is just something about saying "no" to a couple who has packed up there comfortable life in Ft. Wayne and moved for 10 weeks to LA with their two small children to live in housing that changes every two or three weeks all for the sake of moving to Nashville and starting a church. So I said yes. I arrived at Eric's house, where they are staying for anther week, about 5:00 pm and the adventure begins.  As I was finishing making our pasta for dinner, Gracie was walked into the backyard and fell on the steps on her way out the door.  I suppose what happened is what normally happens, there was crying and a scraped knee that I was certainly not aloud to touch, rub or clean in any way, shape or form.  So I dealt with that for all of 15 minutes before I called Elizabeth to get the scoop on what to do.  She told me where the ouch-less cleaner was and just to clean it anyway...right.  Clean it anyway, which I knew, but had no desire to do.  So, we got it cleaned out the best we could without me having to be to forceful.  After everything was fine, we settle in to eat our pasta, which went well, execpt for Gracie saying "I don't know how to eat this." "I don't know this".  What does that mean?  You eat it like you eat anything else.  Eventually she ate when we went outside.  So we played outside for awhile, swinging, writing with sidewalk chalk and going for a ride in the wagon.  Later we ended up inside for a round of Barney and half of Shrek, complete with fruit snacks.  There is a reason I have not yet mentioned Ellie.  She's low maintainace, laid back and content with keeping herself occupied. I love this kid. I could hang out for hours with her.  Bedtime for Ellie was a little different story though.  When I was putting her in her bed, she cried and it was clear she didn't want to go.  Apparently this is a common thing with children. I have no problem going to bed in the middle of the day.  Anyway, as I was putting her in bed, the first time, the side of her crib was too high for my 5'3" body to comfortably put her down in there, so I might have hit her head little hard while I was laying her down.  Needless to say I felt horrible because it was totally my fault, so I took her back out to the living room for more Shrek and then tried again.  Although there was no head banging, there was crying, loudly.  So I took her out again and sat with her in the rocking chair.  Apparently, you just put kids in bed and let them cry until they fall asleep.  However, as one who lives with a constantly crying baby, I was not about to have crying if I didn't have to.  So I tried to put her down again, and then one more time and all was well.  That is until there was the changing of Gracie's pull-up, which was full of a less than thrilling item.  I shall end there, for fear that I will make my own self vomit, simply by reliving the moment.   Some final thoughts:    -Jesus loved children, so I will love them too -diapers are trickier than they look -being completely responsible for the growth, health and development of another human being, toughest job ever -Barney can be slightly entertaining - watching kids is rewarding, but I don't think I'll make a habit of it -"Let the children come to me, and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the Kingdom of God. Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the Kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it."  Luke 18:16-17

      Occured to me the other day You've been gone now a couple years well, I guess it takes while For someone to really disappear I remember where I was When the word came about you It was a day much like today the sky was bright, and wide, and blue  And I wonder where you are And if the pain ends when you die And I wonder if there was Some better way to say goodbye  Today my heart is big and sore it's tryin' to push right through my skin I won't see you anymore I guess that's finally sinkin' in 'Cause you can't make somebody see By the simple words you say All their beauty from within Sometimes they just look away   And I wonder where you are And if the pain ends when you die And I wonder if there was Some better way to say goodbye  -Patty Griffin [Goodbye] (Patty usually says it best)  "Take heart. I have overcome the world."  -Jesus

      As I'm catching up on some writing, I thought I would just write a side note in here.  I have been up since 9:30 this morning.  Awakened by a 7th month old baby who was/is (whatever) colic. It is a daily occurance, sometimes earlier, sometimes later.  She has been SCREAMING since and it is now 12:00 pm. This has been pretty much non-stop this morning.  I mean she has been screaming like a banshee!  And I now know why people shake their babies.  I'm not saying it's right.  I'm just saying I now know why.  That's all I wanted to say.

      I wrote a couple of weeks ago about the possiblity of being involved in starting Mosaic Nashville, and the weeks since the possibility arose have been filled with much thought and excitement about what potentially lies ahead in my near future. After telling people for weeks around here that MAYBE I was going to Nashville, I finally conceded that all of them were right: I was already there.  Since I was asked to think about joining the effort, many of the interns and staff have seen my excitement at the possibility of not only living in Nashville for a time, but also of starting a community from the ground up.  So this is the official announcement, I guess. I will be moving to Nashville, Tennessee in middle to late September, tentatively.  Life is and will always be tentative.  We fool ourselves if we think otherwise.  I will not be a paid staff person, but will be getting a job in the area, whether that begins as a job at Starbucks or not, I don't know. I'm applying for a job at the Christian division of Time Warner Books as an editorial assistant, a job I'm not quite qualified for but I think I could do well.  Merissa, one of the interns here has a friend that lives in Nashville and does PR work for the Gaylord Entertainment Group (they own the Grand Ole Opry, the Opryland Hotel and many other entertainment venues).  Merissa got in touch with her and told her I might be coming out there, and if so what were the chances of me moving in with her.  She lives in a 2 bedroom apartment by herself and said she would love a roommate.  So housing is already set up for me if I so choose to live there.   It has been great to talk to Josh and Elisabeth, a couple who is interning at Mosaic to learn all they can about starting Mosaic Nashville.  They are from Ft. Wayne and have been working at a church there for a few years.  Josh heard Erwin speak in Chicago last summer, read An Unstoppable Force in the fall, went to the Youth Specialties Conference in St. Louis (where he heard Erwin again), and longing to learn how to create "an unstoppable force" he and Elisabeth found themselves putting their house on the market and traveling across the country with their one and a half, and three year old daughters. If you take away the spouse and the children and the putting the house on the market part, and replace Chicago with Minneapolis, you are reading my exact story. Our vision and our hope for the church is the same, and it has been great to talk to them and share ideas, dreams and the excitement of being given the opportunity to have God impact an entire city through our lives.   Hopefully, soon, I wll be able to talk to John Ferguson, who is the leader of this operation.  He may be coming to Los Angeles soon to meet with Josh and Elisabeth, Mike, Myself, and another couple from Seattle that might be joining us as musicians.  Josh White (the guy from Seattle) is a part of a Christian band called Telecast.  I've never heard of them, but I don't listen to a lot of mainstream Christian music, so I don't know how popular they are.  Let me know if you've heard of them.    My time here is growing shorter.  Three and a half weeks until I find myself back in the 'ville for a time.  Yesterday, while running the camera in the morning services it occured to me that I'm really going to miss being a part of this great thing that is happening here.  I've been spoiled by hearing Erwin McManus speak every Sunday and by being able to interact with the staff members here. But that is the experience I signed up for.  I'm in school again, and school always comes to an end. So, I've added more people to my growing collection of acquaintances and am moving on once again, this time to something a little more permanant.  I'm ready for something more permanant, too.  Something I can give myself and my life to for a substantial amount of time.  It is an exciting time to be a Christian.  "and you are Christ's and Christ is God's."   -1 Corinthians 3:23

      James 3:13-18  "Who is wise and understainding among you?  By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.  But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.  This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.  For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.  But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.  And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace."  -you were not supposed to die dumber than you were born -by keeping your head up, focused on wisdom from above, you can stop letting people down -when peopel enter into your life, do they come out a better person or a more broken person?  2 Kinds of Wisdom:  1. Earthly, selfish wisdom  -using people for your own benefit -ambition is natural and good, selfish ambition puts our own good above the good of others -every time you are motivated by selfish ambition you will devistate those around you and those you love the most  2. Heavenly, godly wisdom  -you can measure your wisdom by the number of healthy relationships and friendships that are around you -we intuitively know that wisdom is about creating healthy relationships -people who risk trusting you with their lives, those people who are honest and intimate with you, are they better off for having known you or do they leave more broken?  -when you don't keep your head up, you let those you love most down -treat people as those who have the highest value of all things -wisdom sees the implications of the choices we make; what goes around comes around; you reap what you sow -YOU CAN SEE THE FUTURE BUT YOU HAVE TO WANT TO; CREATE YOUR FUTURE THROUGH WISE CHOICES

      The Dream Center is a church in Los Angeles that is intently focused on the reaching the impoverished of the city.  They do some extremely gritty work with the homeless, the working poor and addicts of the streets.  Every Saturday that run what they call the Adopt-a-Block program in which they bus volunteers to different blocks of the city to give food and clothing to those in need, to pray with them, and to play with children.  A group of us went this weekend and it was quite an experience.  I played in an ally with a bunch of kids, outside of a "hotel".  These "hotels" as they call them are partly governmentment funded and a step up from being homeless. They are filled mostly with people addicted to drugs, mostly single mothers and there multiple children who have different fathers.  They are completely and utterly trapped in a cycle of poverty and drug use.  The Dream Center is doing amazing things in an area that few people are willing to touch, but that we as Christian are called and expected to touch.  To put it in more gritty terms, I spent my Saturday playing with kids in a crack house.  This is not an overstatement.  I spend some time "talking" to a teenage girl who was clearly a crack baby.  Her motor skills were slow, her speech deeply impaired and her smile priceless. If you must live in the environment that was chosen for her, I would think it to your advantage to be mentally impaired.  If you were in your right mind it seems to me that it would be unbearable.  Yet that is why we carry with us Christ, to break such cycles.  We are to meet the needs of the desolate, not to necessarly "win" them to Jesus, but more importantly to simply meet the need.  To love deeply, because we were loved deeply.  To care, because we have been cared for.  To give, because we have been given much.    "Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world."  "Mercy triumphs over judgment."     James 1:27 and 2:13b.   "The serving that we are called to requires direct contact.  You cannot wash the feet of a dirty world if you refuse to touch it."                                                                                          -Erwin McManus (p. 23, An Unstoppable Force)  www.dreamcenter.org

      Tonight I went to see a sketch comedy and improv group called Groundlings.  They are Second City's  (Chicago) equivelant in Los Angeles.  Many of the performers that train and come out of Groundlings and Second City find themselves wrting comedy films, doing comedy shows, and a number have wound up writing for and performing on Saturday Night Live. The pictures displayed in the lobby show the likes of Chris Katan, Will Farrel, Cheri Oteri and Chris Parnell. It was a great night of comedy and a privilege to see such good talent.  If anybody watches VH1's I Love the 70s, 80s, or 90s, there is a woman on there named Rachel Harris. She is a Groundling and it was great to watch someone I actually recognized.  Anyway, I went with a few of the interns and we ate an Argentine grill before hand.  Afterwards I went out for coffee with Josh and Erin Olsen and a couple of guys that came to the show with them.  I did improv with Josh at Taylor and he is currently taking classes at Groundlings. Erin is best friend to my sister-in-law.  It has been great to see them more often.  They actually attend Mosaic and I have seen them much lately.  It is good to have familiar faces around sometimes and even doubly good to have people around who share the same experience of being at Taylor.

      Myself and three other interns found ourselves on our way to San Diego at 7:00 this morning.  Jaime, who recently stepped down from being the youth pastor at Mosaic to start his own business, wanted to take us down to San Diego and just hang out.  He has been a great person to get to know and has really invested a lot in the interns as a whole.  The trip down was filled with great conversation, learning more about one another and about Mosaic, it's past and it's future.  We drove around for a while, saw some great views of the city and then went to the beach for body boarding and what not.  San Diego is beautiful, and that is just that. If I was just intent on existing, making as much money as I could and settling into life for the long haul, San Diego would be the place to be, for sure. The place for kids, the place for sun, the place for mountains, the place for water, the place for perfect weather, the place for all things comfortable and luxurious. Alas, that is not the calling I have received.  It was an increadible day though and a much needed day away from Los Angeles.

      Today, I was working in Alex's McManus's office with Peter.  We were working on planning a retreat that is coming up on the 30th of this month.  We were in Alex's office because the lead team was having their weekly meeting in the big part of the office where all the couches are. When he came back in from his meeting we started to gather our things, but he said, "No, you guys don't have to go. Please just stay there."  So we did. Alex sat at his desk whil we sat on the floor and he began to ask us what we were working on.  That conversation evolved into "how did you come to be here at Mosaic", "what are you long term goals for being here", "what do you want to accomplish", "what are your dreams". As we talked, Mike came in and just asked if he could sit and listen.  Soon, Josh came in and sat down too, then Jason and Merissa, then Scott, then Kendra, then Jen.  We were all on the floor, listening intently to the wise sage.  A work day turned into a 3 hour motivational, educational and inspirational conversation.  We were being poured into.  Alex asked us many question and talked about many things, getting to know each of our names, our personalities (mostly inferred through conversation), and our hopes. He asked us all, "what leader/hero in an action movie do you most see yourself as?"  There was William Wallace and Robert Bruce from Braveheart, Legolas from Lord of the Rings and a number of others.  I picked Samwise Gamgee, from Lord of the Rings. Sam was the one who kept the vision alive.  He kept envisioning the Shire and being at home and was intent on accomplishing the task he had been given to do.  He was loyal to the end, insisting that he made a promise and it was going to be kept.  He may not have been the most obvious leader, and certainly on his own he would have been no good.  But he had a cause worth fighting for and friends who were all fighting for that same cause.  He had to be loyal to the accomplishment of fthe cause, for if he was not, life would cease and there would be no reason to go on living:      Frodo: "I can’t do this, Sam."  Sam: "I know. It’s all wrong. By right we shouldn’t even be here. It’s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really matter. Full of darkness and danger they were. And sometimes you didn’t want to know the end, because how could the end be happy? How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened?  But in the end, it’s only a passing thing, this shadow.  Even darkness must pass.  A new day will come. And when the sun shines, it will shine out the clearer.  Those were the stories that stayed with you that meant something.  Even if you were too small to understand why. But I think Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now.  Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn’t.  They kept going because they were holding on to something.  Frodo:  What are we holding on to, Sam?  Sam:  That there’s some good in this world, Mr. Frodo.  And it’s worth fighting for.   The  next question was, "which leader/hero in an action movie would you most follow."  My answer again appeared from Lord of the Rings, sighting Aragorn this time.  His humility and his servanthood speaks volumes of his character.  His quiet life, his evident wisdom makes you intrigued as to what it might look like when all of his power as the king of men is unleashed.  When it is time for him to assume his place as king, everyone is ready to follow, because his worth has been well proven by his quiet action.  "All that is gold does not glitter; not all those that wander are lost."   Through talking with Alex and being able to connect and share my heart with him, and to gain insight about myself and my dreams, I was forever changed.  Every so often people step into our lives that make us rethink everything: our worldview, our theology, our mission.  I've met so many of those kinds of people this summer and will be better for it.

      This past Monday, July 12th, we (being the internals, as we are affectionately called by some) had a question and answer time with Robert Martinez.  Robert is one of the elders at Mosaic and is head of the counseling ministry. He began by telling us about his own journey to Mosaic, which began with the death of his first wife and the following depression and loneliness of his two young teenage daughters. A friend introduced the girls to Mosaic (formerley The Church on Brady) in order to get them connected with other young people.  After a while, Robert joined the girls at Mosaic.  Robert, through a series of interactions with people, became the go to guy for people in need of counseling and advice.  His referrels eventually became so many that he decided to pursue counseling further and develop his God-given abilities.  He has been heading the couseling ministry for over 25 years now.   It was very beneficial to hear what he had to say about Christian counseling and what that looks like at Mosaic.  Mostly, the couseling staff at Mosaic does marital and premarital counseling, due to its large number of singles.  For the same reason, much of the counseling of young twentysomethings deals with life direction, God's call upon their life, sin issues, relationship issues, and depression.  Mosaic trains and certifies their own counselors, believing that the local church is the body responsible for counseling those who come within its doors. All attendees may receive counseling from Mosaic.  One does not have to be a member.  In fact, as any member of Mosaic would tell you, the only benefit to membership is getting to serve.  Robert said that in all his years of doing this, he has only sent two people on to professional psychologists.  His belief is that professional counseling tells a person what to put off, but not what to put on.  It is not enough simply to break old habits, but it is vital to form new, good habits.  This meeting was yet another great opportunity to hear more stories about the Mosaic community.

      "But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.  For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.  For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.  But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing."  James 1:22-25  -You are a warrior.

      Tonight, I was privileged to go the Hollywood Bowl, a huge outdoor ampitheater in Hollywood.  It is home to the LA Philharmonic (with whom Nickel Creek will be playing in September) and many other acts that stop by.  Tonight was special though, because tonight was Sing-A-Long with The Sound of Music. That's right, we all sat in our seats watched the movie on the big screen and sang along as the words appeared. Before the show, they had a costume contest and many were dressed up as characters in the film.  Four children took home the grand prize of airfare and accomidations for two in San Franscico.  Brilliant mom and dad, brilliant.  Dress up your four children as "Rain Drops On Roses" and then leave them at home with grandma and grandpa and enjoy a weekend getaway.  Genius! It was great to see the movie again and especially with such an interactive audience. Everyone was way into it.  At one point, when Captain von Trapp is singing "Edelweiss", a majority of the audience held up their cell phones with the lights on and swayed with them back and forth.  Now, this type of thing is usually done with a lighter at a rock concert, and the atmosphere is usally one of smoke (of any variety) and beer.  However, in the Hollywood Hills, they prefer cell phones and wine. I didn't join in, but did I sit there quite amused.  The cool night air was great for the sunburn I aquired Friday at the beach, and my aching musles from playing broom hockey/ball on Friday night have been grateful for all of the Advil I've been taking for the burn pain.

      Well, yet another option has been thrown onto my plate while here in Southern California. Mike, an intern here at Mosaic and a graduate of Asbury Seminary, is here in preparation to plant a Mosaic church in Nashville. He isn't the main guy, but he is on board and currently looking for jobs in the area. The other night when we were talking on top of The Standard Hotel (see "Catch Up" blog)he basically said to me, "come with us and help." At first I just kind of played it off like it wasn't an option. It didn't take me long to remember how much I loved Nashville. I've wanted to live there at some point in my life for as long as I can remember, possibly doing work in the music industry. It was always just a dream, and now I can possibly make it a reality. Oddly enough, church planting is something that I have always wanted to do. The idea of beginning a church, starting from the ground up has always appealed to me, and now I have to opportunity to do it in a city I love with people who share my vision for the Kingdom of God.   Right now, I have about 6 weeks to decide where my life is headed next. I can stay here, get a job, maybe start a masters programs, or I can begin to search for jobs in Nashville and head down there in the fall. Let's be honest: right now,as always, Nashville is much more appealing. It's smaller, it's familiar, it's closer to home. I have a had a wonderful experience so far here in LA, and through it I have found out what I really like.  And I really like the mid-west and the southland. This is truly where my heart is, with the people of those areas of the country. In talking with Mike, we share the same vision of awakening or re-awakening the Church in this area to an understading of the dynamic mission of Christ. I want to be an agent of change in the place my heart most dearly loves.   However, I still do not know what the future will hold for me in the fall. This girl does not make decisions quickly. Mike encouraged me to fast and pray about the decision at hand. The cool part is, there isn't a bad choice. Both options will move me in the direction I want to go.  Both options put me in places where I can learn, grow and move with God.   Please keep praying for this wanderer.

      This Monday night at the Summit, we all discussed our strengths as found by the Gallup Organizations strengths finder test. Out of a possible 34 strengths, this test gives you your top five and only your top five in order that you may enhance your strengths instead of dwelling on your weaknesses. As an introspective person what I can't do and what I'm not good at are on my mind quite often. Taking this test was great for me to realize what I am good at and how I can best use those strengths in a job, in ministry and in interpersonal relationships. Here are my top five strengths:    Input   [thinking family]   You are inquisitive. You collect things. You might collect information-words, facts, books, and quotations-or you might collect tangible objects such as butterflies, baseball cards, porcelain dolls, or sepia photographs. Whatever you collect, you collect it because it interests you. And yours is the kind of mind that finds so many things interesting. The world is exciting precisely because of its infinite variety and complexity. If you read a great deal, it is not necessarily to refine your theories but, rather, to add more information to your archives. If you like to travel, it is because each new location offers novel artifacts and facts. These can be acquired and then stored away. Why are they worth storing? At the time of storing it is often hard to say exactly when or why you might need them, but who knows when they might become useful? With all those possible uses in mind, you really don't feel comfortable throwing anything away. So you keep acquiring and compiling and filing stuff away. It's interesting. It keeps your mind fresh. And perhaps one day some of it will prove valuable.      Intellection   [thinking family]   You like to think. You like mental activity. You like exercising the "muscles" of your brain, stretching them in multiple directions. This need for mental activity may be focused; for example, you may be trying to solve a problem or develop an idea or understand another person's feelings. The exact focus will depend on your other strengths. On the other hand, this mental activity may very well lack focus. The theme of Intellection does not dictate what you are thinking about; it simply describes that you like to think. You are the kind of person who enjoys your time alone because it is your time for musing and reflection. You are introspective. In a sense you are your own best companion, as you pose yourself questions and try out answers on yourself to see how they sound. This introspection may lead you to a slight sense of discontent as you compare what you are actually doing with all the thoughts and ideas that your mind conceives. Or this introspection may tend toward more pragmatic matters such as the events of the day or a conversation that you plan to have later. Wherever it leads you, this mental hum is one of the constants of your life.      Relator   [relating family]   Relator describes your attitude toward your relationships. In simple terms, the Relator theme pulls you toward people you already know. You do not necessarily shy away from meeting new people-in fact, you may have other themes that cause you to enjoy the thrill of turning strangers into friends-but you do derive a great deal of pleasure and strength from being around your close friends. You are comfortable with intimacy. Once the initial connection has been made, you deliberately encourage a deepening of the relationship. You want to understand their feelings, their goals, their fears, and their dreams; and you want them to understand yours. You know that this kind of closeness implies a certain amount of risk-you might be taken advantage of-but you are willing to accept that risk. For you a relationship has value only if it is genuine. And the only way to know that is to entrust yourself to the other person. The more you share with each other, the more you risk together. The more you risk together, the more each of you proves your caring is genuine. These are your steps toward real friendship, and you take them willingly.      Learner   [thinking family]   You love to learn. The subject matter that interests you most will be determined by your other themes and experiences, but whatever the subject, you will always be drawn to the process of learning. The process, more than the content or the result, is especially exciting for you. You are energized by the steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to competence. The thrill of the first few facts, the early efforts to recite or practice what you have learned, the growing confidence of a skill mastered-this is the process that entices you. Your excitement leads you to engage in adult learning experiences-yoga or piano lessons or graduate classes. It enables you to thrive in dynamic work environments where you are asked to take on short project assignments and are expected to learn a lot about the new subject matter in a short period of time and then move on to the next one. This Learner theme does not necessarily mean that you seek to become the subject matter expert, or that you are striving for the respect that accompanies a professional or academic credential. The outcome of the learning is less significant than the "getting there."      Adaptability   [striving family]   You live in the moment. You don't see the future as a fixed destination. Instead, you see it as a place that you create out of the choices that you make right now. And so you discover your future one choice at a time. This doesn't mean that you don't have plans. You probably do. But this theme of Adaptability does enable you to respond willingly to the demands of the moment even if they pull you away from your plans. Unlike some, you don't resent sudden requests or unforeseen detours. You expect them. They are inevitable. Indeed, on some level you actually look forward to them. You are, at heart, a very flexible person who can stay productive when the demands of work are pulling you in many different directions at once.   I have a lot of thinking themes, which I knew beforehand. I didn't necessarily think they were strengths, just characteristics that made me socially awkward at times:) Sometimes I wish I wasn't so heady, but that is how God made me. Now, the task before me is to figure out what to do with these strengths.  What career path to pursue (yes,  I said the word  career ), what ministry suits me best and how to apply my strengths to my everyday relationships with other.  I will write more as I discover more.

      Watch. Listen. Jump. Think. It's a great combination as far as M. Night Shyamalan is concerned. The director of Unbreakable, The Sixth Sense and Signs had made another film for the thinking man and woman.  I cannot tell you anything else, except to see it.  Otherwise, I'd be giving things away.    A good article on M. Night can be found at www.csmonitor.com/2004/0728/p15s01-almo.html  I also saw Secret Window, with Johnny Depp recently (technically, a grammatically correct sentence would say that I "saw Secret Window starring Johnny Depp". However, written this way makes it sound like I actually watched the movie with Johnny Depp, which would have been cool; especially if he was wearing that pirate outfit). It is also a great suspense film for those of you who are into such things, as I am.   Happy movie viewing!

      The other day, on my way out the door to go to a meeting, I reached into Grant and Lora's refridgerator and grabbed a Diet Coke with Lime, figuring I should at least give it a chance.  I adore lime, and I absolutely hate Diet Coke.  I love regular Coke, and because of my love for it and its love for making me chubby, I've limited myself to one a week.  As I walked down the sidewalk towards my car and popped that can open, I felt like all those beautiful, skinny people that drink Diet Coke on the commercials. I walked with a little bounce in my step, tipped the can up and took that first sip.  You know, the one they always make look so refreshing on the commercials.  My tongue instantly recognized that it had been betrayed by my mind, and my taste buds knew that they were being force fed a whole lot of diet and a whole little lime.  Two truths that I have lived by continue to ring true for me after my Diet Coke with Lime experience:  1.  You can dress it up however you like, diet is still diet and therefore, nasty. 2.  One Coca-Cola Classic a week is worth three Diet Cokes a day.

      Driving through the coastal mountains is amazing.  The sun shines brighter near the coast and the sky is a bright blue, the kind you see in postcards. The company is warm, follwoing the sun's lead, and the love of the Creator spills in through the open windows as the wind whips through my ever blondish hair.  In one deep breath I feel life enter into my body and I almost choke on its newness.  Meanwhile, the prophets sing, "we were meant to live for so much more."

      Another best sermon I've ever heard :)  "Come now, you who say, “Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit”— yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes. Instead you ought to say, “If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that.” As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.  So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin."  James 4:13-17  -the fact that you can remember your path adn imagine the future is part of God's design -we can remember backwards and reflect forwards -the only place we can live in is the present, and it's the most elusive -we must have a proper relationship to the present; "you are a mist..."; do not live in the illusion that you are not going to die; "if it is the Lord's will we will live" -"Today is a good day to die." [The Code of the Samuri] -do not use the future to escape the present -we don't like the price have to pay to live life in the present -people who change the world do so one square foot at a time, by living in the present, by serving and making a daily contribution to humanity -in preparing for the future do not abdicate your responsibility to the present; make sure that the future doesn't rob you of the present, which is the only reality in which you can live -stop long enough to ask yourself, "am I living the life God created me to live?" -if you are miserable on the course you are taking, maybe it's time to re-evaluate the course -we know enough from God's word to fill a lifetime; we already know the good we are to do; knowing too much paralyses us and makes us indecisive -if you knew everything you think you need to know, you wouldn't get out of bed; if you knew everything God knew, you would run for your life -somewhere along the line we have to stop preparing for the future and start living in the present
