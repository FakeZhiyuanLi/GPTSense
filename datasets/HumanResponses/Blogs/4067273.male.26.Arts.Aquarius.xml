      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was many years ago when I first heard the term "Afro-Asian Blend."&nbsp; Since then I have tried everything in my power to make this term synonymous with me and only me.&nbsp; It fits me well, as far as I can tell, and I 'd like to make sure that no one else will try to use it.&nbsp; Hey, maybe someday I'll even try to copyright it....Who knows.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But like I said, it has been several years since I first heard this term, "Afro-Asian Blend."&nbsp; I was attending college in North Carolina and was majoring in Drama, which was quite strange to my family since I had always wanted to go into medicine.&nbsp; It was a very interesting time, one in which my mother&nbsp;(I'm sure) will never forget.&nbsp; But going on, it was the drama department which introduced me to a host of new and entertaining friends.&nbsp; These people and their ideas were completely new and fascinating to me.&nbsp; They shared A passion for life and art that I had not witnessed in others, and immediately I knew that I belonged with them.&nbsp; They invigorated me and motivated me to grow in my own art.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time passed I began to meet more and more thespians in my dept., and came to regard all of them as my friends,&nbsp;&nbsp;a trend that would follow me throughout&nbsp;my theatrical experience.&nbsp; Soon I was hanging out with these funny artistic types and was invited to many a drama party.&nbsp; If you have ever been to a drama party, then you know of the jolly, crazy, fun that would erupt as well as all the...Well...Drama.&nbsp; Being Drama majors we couldn't help but bring about more drama no matter our environment.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was at one these parties that I first heard the term.&nbsp; A fellow thespian came up to me and starting asking questions about me, such as why I was in the Drama dept. or even that particular school for that matter.&nbsp; She seemed really interested in me and I have to confess, I was in awe.&nbsp; She was an upper classman and was pursuing directing.&nbsp; I had&nbsp; already seen some of here work and was very impressed.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the first moment she began talking to me, I could tell that there was something else she wanted to ask but she didn't know&nbsp;how she would do it without offending me.&nbsp; Now being someone of mixed heritage I knew that questioning look&nbsp;on her eyes all too well.&nbsp; It said  "Where exactly are you from?" &nbsp; In my years this question has come to me in many peculiar and maybe even rude ways, but I'm used to it and never let the question infuriate me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've gotten  "What are You?",&nbsp;" Where are you from?",&nbsp;"What are your origins?" &nbsp; More directly I've gotten  "Are you Mexican?...Hawaiian?...Puerto Rican?...Indian?" &nbsp; None of it surprises me anymore.&nbsp; But the question that girl posed on me that day will stay fresh in my memory forever.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally picking up her courage, she turned to me and said, " So what are you?&nbsp; Some sort of Afro-Asian Blend?"&nbsp;  At first all I could do was stare, not really registering what she had said.&nbsp; Slowly I worked what she said over in my head and could not stop the grin from spreading on my face or the laughter from erupting out of my mouth as I answered yes.&nbsp; Immediately I saw an image of myself walking into a coffee shop and asking the attendant &nbsp;"excuse me, but may I have the Afro-Asian blend?"&nbsp;&nbsp;  The Girl (whose name I can't remember for the life of me) was immediately embarrassed for having used such terminology, but I told her not to worry and thanked her profusely for introducing me to such a new and exotic flavor in gourmet coffee.
