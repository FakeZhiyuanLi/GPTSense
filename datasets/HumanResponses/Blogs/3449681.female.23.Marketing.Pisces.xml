      day 2 of my blogging. i'm still a little unsure about all of this, but i'm gonna go with it. last night my boyfriend asked me what the point of online journals are. i told him it was so people don't get hand cramps trying to write in a real journal. and his reply was yeah, but who reads it? i told him it's for girlfriends and boyfriends to read. so if he reads this, i'll know about it cuz he'll ask me about it when i talk to him tonight. but i guess he's not really being nosy if the words are public knowledge.   anyway, its raining again, and the air conditioning is so cold it's enough to kill a polar bear. not to change the subject, but i'm going to change the subject...yesterday it took me a half hour to leave work cuz there were two wild turkeys AND a raccoon circling my car. they were treating my elantra like a rotting deer carcas. just glaring at it with their mouth's watering. thinking that if a big hunk of metal was appetizing to them, they probably would have found me to be dilectible, so i made the receptionist (a 5 foot 1 inch woman) and a sales guy escort me out to my car. we walked with so much confidence you would have thought we were the top 3 in the miss america contest. Mary Lou (the receptionist) told us they smell fear, so we remained as calm and cool as possible, pretending that their spikes wouldn't pierce our flesh no matter how close we got to them.  lucky me, i lived and all is well.  lata

      Well after viewing Jeremy's postings, I tried to post a comment asking where Tiffany's mom's new restaurant is, when I found myself signing up for my own blogger. unusual to say the least. i can't really say there is much to add today, except that i was told recently that Bob from Bob's Discount Furniture is paralyzed. I'm currently in the process of uncovering the truth to that. I'm still unsure, although he does sit in that recliner pretty often during his commercials.

      do you ever wonder how ants know that they need to make little hills of sand to live in, rather than just sleeping in different places every night? and why do beavers build dams? it's not like they live there for long anyway. and why do snipers snipe? what's the deal with that? it's such a copout. grow some balls and get out of the damn tree. if you really want to hurt someone, why don't you hurt yourself? does it really make sense to shoot people for no reason? if that was the case, co-workers wouldn't exist...families wouldn't exist, and politics certainly would be interesting. Abortion? I say yes! Well I say no! Well fuck you then Bam Bam Bam....end of conversation. I guess it would symplify things a bit, but when things are symplified, aren't there always repercutions? Like when computers take over all the toll booth worker's jobs, and we don't have to pay such high rates to drive from chicopee to boston. I mean isn't the function of a huge percentage of the tolls just to pay these people $16 an hour to inhale fumes and handle dirty money all day? ridiculous really. And why do they make that much money? because that's the mass pike's way of justifying those crappy tolls. why don't we just charge $20 per car, regardless of how far you're driving, that way we can line the roads with gold and it'll look really good to all those people coming from new hampshire and vermont. they won't be so excited about their ice cream and green mountains once they see our gold-lined highways and prada-wearing toll booth collectors!!!  i swear, massachusetts has it all figured out. no more from me today.
