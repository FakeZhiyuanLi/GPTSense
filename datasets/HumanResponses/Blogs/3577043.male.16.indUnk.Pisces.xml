      Hey...just to remind everyone...AGAIN...I'm leaving July 2nd.  Don't ask me to go anywhere...or do anything...or anything like that....I'm needed here.  Have questions...email me and I'll get back to you AFTER vacation.  I'm a bit MAD to say the least right now...but I'm not going to be available so don't try calling or doing anything for right now.  Josh...I'll take care of you before I leave.    For all of you other people...enjoy the month and try not to party too much while enjoying your graciously given freedom....

      Here's the deal. This is stupid. Just put a filter up.  This law won't affect me but I don't want to keep going back to my credit card number or whatever will be used so my kid can go to games sites that might be blocked. The word 'porn' is funny cause you can think of so many things.  I get the picture of the 42 year old male wasting away with the Kleenexes of sperm layin around or the 18 yr old male who just got a credit card and can't get enough pussy. Get a life.  For one thing, if your kid is discovering this stuff, you're gonna be able to tell because it shows up on the  computer .  Then you can sit down and have the porn talk...it's kind of like the birds and the bees but he'll ask you why girls suck horse dick and how come people shove toys in themselves.  Anyways, this all goes back to the parents who should pay attention and not rely on some porn law.

      References to God were ordered to be put back into oaths by a judge of the state Supreme Court.  Apparently, one judge took it upon himself to change courtroom procedure by taking God out.  If the judges fail to follow through with the court's request, they may be held in contempt of court.  In a quote, "Basically the judge swore in his own witnesses,"  ...  "I think this decision returns this court to the people instead of like a dictatorship of one judge."  He's got a point.  Good to have God back in our oaths.

      I don't know if this day is significant.  But besides Spider Man 2 opening with a four-star rating (WOO HOO!), let's remember the Muppets.  Incredibly entertaining puppets have never been so cool. Everyone post their favorite.  I am gonna have to go with either Fozzie or Kermit.  Although, I think I am a lot like Kermit mainly cause no matter what we'll both always be chased by a pig.

      Hahahahaha... LMAO hehehehehehe... I get it.  You guys don't think I am serious.  I post a movie idea and way for EVERYONE to get together and no one pays any attention.  I give three ways to reach me and NO ONE CARES.  I've had zero responses.  How many?  This isn't some message from your mom to clean your bedroom... or a complaint from your principal to call him doctor.  This is an attempt for a get together with EVERYBODY...    Ok you still think I am kidding?  Inside information.... I am right now working on a large party from like 6:30 to 10:30 tommorow night... Tuesday Night.  Then Spider Man 2 sometime Wednesday.  You all are welcome anytime.  Working on these plans though and so I'll have to post more details later.  But YOU ALL ARE INVITED.   Hey...whose invited?  EVERYONE  Okay so if you (i'm talking to you) want to come post something...like a comment or a post... And/or let someone know (TALK TO ME) Looking forward to havin this so I'm gonna go try to work it out.   But in the future, when I ask people to let me know what they think of seeing a movie like I did with the Spider Man 2, let me know please.  Later.

      This morning handover was complete.  What does that mean?  Bush admitted he couldn't run Iraq anymore.  And other people who understand the country better are going to pick up the pieces.  Good luck and god bless our troops who are basically now a rock in a hard place.

      I dunno but I was thinkin...movies (or documentaries) probably make more money because of the controversy they create.  Like..if a movie has a lot of buzz going around with it, it'll probly do better than a movie that doesn't.  But just because it makes a lot of money, doesn't necessarily make it good.  It might just make a lot of money because of how controversial it is - not because it's any good.  Just a random thought.

      I just read that people are saying Kerry's wife could be worth 1 billion dollars.  That's great but it doesn't matter.  How much is Kerry worth?  Better yet, how much is he worth compared to Bush?  There's something people need to know.

      This article can be found in your South Bend Tribune for Sunday, June 27th.  I have chosen to summarize what it is because it's a phenomenal story of stupidity.   The article says one-third of emergency evacuations fail.  In some cases, planes are fined.  Of course, the government is doing  everything  to figure out what the root of the problem is.  This is a common problem says federal safety officials.  The article says the reason behind it is often workers failing to remove a pin from the slides even though there is an attachment that reads "remove before flight".  These pins make the slide inoperable.  Keep reading...  This dumbass article continues with a quote from a board chairman, "We need to find out why so many slides fail during actual evacuations."    Solution?  More tests on the slides that would cost more money for the airlines.  Also because of the tests, more planes would be taken out of use.  I am hoping you've caught on to my point.  My friends who have jobs, this is one of those things that affects taxes or takes away from money that could go to better things.

      "Friends don't let friends plan things without letting the person who is planning it know that they are going to go or not"  It's a pretty long one but a pretty important one to memorize.  If you can remember to call and tell the inviter that you want to go, the inviter will continue to make you an invitee.  As corny as this sounds, some people haven't picked up on the concept yet.

      Ok so I'm getting my three friends now (Josh and Kevin get what I'm saying) because everyone needs to go to camp next year!!! I'm serious u guys have no idea how much fun it would be to have everyone go.  It was seriously nonstop fun for the entire week...unbelievable.  It's not even explainable.  There's so much to do!! You can swim, or climb stuff or have someone make u fly in the air and into a lake, or go on a zip line into a lake, or walk on ropes, or go biking and so0o0o0o0 much more.  It's so easy to do stuff as a group too!  Some stuff is required for u to do, and then they give you free time so you can do whatever you want.  It's the best ever!! EVERYONE needs to go next year - EVERYONE.  It's seriously the best experience you'll ever have.

      As administrator of Local Cafe, I support Michael Moore and his creation of Fahrenheit 9/11.  I am a growing individual and I am not afraid of the truth.  I believe in spreading it and so far, there has been nothing to tell me that this movie isn't hard fact.  But that's not what this posting is for.  It's so I can tell you that this man is being asked to not air commercials for it because it slams Bush.  Therefore it could not be aired on TV in the 30 days before he is nominated to be running in November.  It would be pulled July 31st if this is enforced on his ad.  Let me say if Dodgeball was pulled, I would find it absurd that it would be pulled and not able to run.  Ads for movies can play as much as the maker wants.  Fahrenheit 9/11 is a movie not a campaign ad.

      Paige...I got online last night and actually did some research for "WAYS TO GET RID OF A STALKER."  Here's what I found:  1.) Kill him 2.) Move 3.) Tell him your dad's got a shotgun 4.) Try going out with him...they usually will panic and     leave you alone 5.) Start stalking him 6.) Make him come over and do housework 7.) Torch his house 8.) Send him flowers from some other girl you don't like 9.) Call the police 10.) Refer to #1  Hope that helped...good luck!

      Wow...what a blast I had.  I only wish every kid could go through what I went through and just have nonstop fun for one whole week.  Anyways, I am not at all curious how Mishawaka was while I was gone but I am curious how u all were.  I am seeing Dodgeball today since that is one of the few things I constantly thought about at camp.  You're all invited...phone calls are coming.  I am a little tired but not too much.  The bus was nice but I still was crammed like a sardine and I am still recovering.  Anyways, later.

      OK....its 2:42 AM right now and I have spent the last  2 HOURS  looking for the "Color My World" song off of the new M&M Commercial (well its old now).  I fell in LOVE with that song and NOBODY KNOWS WHERE THE HECK TO FIND THE FULL SONG.  I just finished emailing M&M to ask them where the heck I can find it.  I found a  urlLink link for the actual commercial  from M&M so that if anyone else loves the song...you can watch and hear it too!  Maybe i'm weird...BUT I LOVE THIS SONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Enjoy ;-)

Don't take this wrong...and don't think i'm thinking anything that I'm not thinking, I just think that I should feel lucky because it will give you girls a chance to see "the real me,"  not the me with Kevin, Josh, David, Spencer...all of them.  I seem to act different around them for some reason, and for some even greater reason I act worse around them then what my true self is.  I'll obviously have to delete this before they get back...LOL, but I just think its about time that I prove myself for who I really am.  By the way...I mainly mean on here; I won't like come over to your house and stalk you type of thing ;-)  Anyway...look forward to this week with you gu...i mean girls.    OH...tell me when Izzy and Allison get back!  Thanks!

      In previous posts, although  I  find them interesting, I have noticed no comments.  As a writer, I get the impression you don't like them, so, as a writer, I'm going to change my style.  (The previous is garbage just so you know)    Summer    While thinking of you, with the summer dew catching the beautiful rays I think of us, together at last On one of these summer days  But you're never around, so I feel bound to simply thinking of you Thinking of us, together at last Just watching the morning dew  Finally one day, I decide to pray For you to come home to me I think he heard, for on the next day You came strolling home to me!  I'm a horrible poet...but I thought I would try something new!

      GRESHAM, Ore. (AP) - An Oregon City doctor will spend two months in jail after he advised a patient that having sex with him would help her pelvic pain, then billed the Oregon Health Plan for his time during their sessions.   Dr. Randall J. Smith, 50, must also perform 200 hours of community service and pay $1,105 in fines as part of a plea agreement, Rodney Hopkinson, a senior assistant attorney general for the Oregon Department of Justice, told The Oregonian newspaper.   Hopkinson said Randall, who worked as an osteopath at the Adventist Health Clinic-Rockwood in Gresham, also was sentenced to 18 months probation by Multnomah County Circuit Judge Julie Frantz on Monday.   Randall voluntarily surrendered his medical license to the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners on March 4, officials said.    Hopkinson said the woman told officials that Smith told her massaging her ``trigger points'' would alleviate her pain. Eventually, he said, the therapy involved sexual intercourse.    Smith told prosecutors that the sex was consensual, Hopkinson said.    Adventist Health fired Smith and reimbursed the Oregon Health Plan about $5,000 to cover the cost of the claims, according to spokesman Monty Knittel.

      People who see movies or the more sophisticated term, moviegoers, have a tough decision this week.  Dodgeball is definitely going to be a top comedy of the summer.  But, then there's The Terminal with Tom Hanks.  Once again, another awesome solo performance by an awesome actor.  Add this one into your collection of hits like Forrest Gump or Castaway.  So what do you do if you can't afford to see both right now?  Well... Combine the two.  I am doing what no other company is doing.  I plan to release "Dodgeball: The Terminal Story".  It begins with a dodgeball game going full throttle.  Then you meet all your favorite Dodgeball characters.  Halfway through this 2 and a half hour extravaganza, you find out they have to play the finals in the airport where Tom Hanks is.  The rest, well...you'll have to imagine that.

      Alright, so it didn't work out, but that doesn't mean you can't get me into a position where I have to wait and postpone it.  That's right.  I have every intention of seeing Dodgeball friday when I get back from camp.  I also am thinking I will see two movies too.  So, think about it and then I'll talk to you about it when I get back.

      Does this term catch your attention?  It might if running under it was a line that read "There's a new trend among vegetarians-  eating meat ."  I had to click because this just seemed impossible.  It was worse than I thought.  Apparently, no longer is it a black or white system where you're either a vegetarian or not.  There's a large part of it that can be in between.  Check this out:  Vegans: Do not eat meat, poultry, fish, dairy, eggs or honey.   (These people are hardcore.)  Strict vegetarians: Do not eat meat, poultry or fish.  (These are the weaker because they see no problem with eggs or honey.  After all,  they aren't meat  !  Flexitarians: Include the groups below:   -- Vegetarian: Those who say they are vegetarian, or "almost vegetarian," but use some meat, poultry or fish.   -- Vegetarian-inclined: Replace meat with meat alternatives for at least some meals, usually maintain a vegetarian diet, or eat four or more meatless meals per week.   -- Health-conscious: Strive for a balanced eating plan or eat two to three meatless meals per week.   This is where I have a problem.  What is vegetarian-inclined?  I know several people who are vegetarian-inclined because they can't afford to buy meat.  Health-conscious?  Two or three meatless meals are nothin! There's no way you could possibly be healthy like a true vegetarian.  Nope, you just think you are.  And I think this flexitarian thing is incredibly retarded.

      Okay, I am just about sick of all the Ben Stiller crap I've been hearing lately.  Here's a guy whose making me laugh day in and day out and all I hear is he's trying to make another Something Bout Mary this and he plays whiney bozos that.  Ok maybe he does overdo it on the typecast roles you know but uh... I don't see you landing the gigs Mr. Big Shot I'll Write An Article on Ben person.  You know, and he's not Oscar award winning.  But he can sure bring home an MTV Movie Award.  Starsky and Hutch awesome!  Dodgeball...soon to be another Stiller favorite.  You don't like it, then shut up and SIT DOWN!

It's one of the best schools in Houston."     So he thinks that "at-risk" means "can't learn?"  And that one of the best schools in Houston is filled with students that can't learn? What an idiot.

      Let's stick one guy in each department of our government whose primary job is to be the most obvious he can be.  It seems to me the things we aren't getting are so obvious.  This man can challenge his peers to use clues to discover what the problem is.  He can also have mail time, where letters are read of importance.  At the end of the day, we'll put him in a chair and he will be responsible for putting clues together to come up with the answer. Hey, we'll even let him Blue skiddoo.  So here's a model:  Ok so Steve (that's our guy's code name) knows it's a terrorist.  He knows they're from Saudi Arabia.  He knows they are hateful.   Al Qaeda Terrorist ...We just figured out Blue's Clues, we just figured out Blue's Clues, we just figured out Blue's Clues and it was really fun!

      Frank Robinson, the former great Oriole and manager of the Expos, came out on the field on a foul-ball home run which the umpires called fair.  This is what he had to say.  "Four guys out there all saying that they saw it the same way —  you've got to be kidding me !" Robinson said. "Didn't any of them see it the right way? That's the key. I don't care how they saw it, all four may have seen it one way, but it wasn't right."   I about got thrown out for saying the exact same thing.  However, Robinson ended up choking himself symbolizing that the umpires choked on the call.  That's when he was thrown out of the game.

      The 9/11 commission is like a publicized show of how bad we as Americans are at picking up on the easiest of things.  If only we had a team day in day out that was being paid to go through documents and make phone calls and hold personal interviews, then we'd be able to know ahead of time if disasters could happen.  Wait...we have  two  teams...the FBI and the CIA.  But they weren't working and so now we have the Commission.  Bush just gave out 15 million so we could all as Americans, piss our pants at night as we find out things that we thought were true were in fact wrong.  The attacks...   Umm they weren't connected to Iraq. Umm terrorists got money from U.S. Umm air traffic defense not safe.  Umm our intelligence gathering sucks.  Umm our president is incompetant and must have Cheney with him to answer questions on attacks.    It's probably a good thing an election is coming up. I will follow up with a solution.

      We're back...new and improved with your considerations in mind!  I found another article while searching for something and came across this:  Foreign countries are now starting to decree that flying foreign country's flags during athletic events is a sign of DISRESPECT!  Yes, countries across the sea are beginning to believe that flying their components flag is disrespectful to the HOSTING TEAMS COUNTRY.  So far the US and Canada have not taken part of this new "scheme."  As for our opinion here, it should be considered more disrespectful to your country for NOT flying your opponents flag during an event because it shows how stuck-up you are.  Hopefully the US never stoops to this level.

      I spent 2 hours looking for something to write in here that would actually be interesting.  Here's my go at it:  A recent article was taken from a Vietnam News Paper that discussed 9/11.  The main point was about if we deserved it or not.  Apparently, 76% of the people questioned answered YES.  They said several years ago they would have gladly came here to live, but after 9/11, they said that they saw how awful our country was and were halfway happy that we were attacked.  "It put them back into prospective" said one guy.  I just thought that with everything going on that this would be something we could talk about.  Personally, I think Vietnam can go stick their heads back in their own tree hole and leave us alone.  Do  you  think that we deserved to be attacked?

      I would like to take this opportunity to thank Spencer for staying up to 12:30 tonight to explain sports to me.  I would also like to take this time to thank everyone who has taken the time to explain sports to me, like Josh and David.  Working with these guys has been really nice and a true learning experience in all fields.  I know...you're all like "It's no big deal.  We're cool with it," but I am very sentimental and appreciate everything, so I like to thank people.  I know that I wouldn't be half the guy I am now...and i'm being serious, if I didn't have you guys to (on a funny note) prove wrong (lol) and to keep pushing me to learn new things.  Like I said...just wanting to thank everyone while I can. (I get this strange feeling I've done this before...have I? If so..sorry!) If I get..."Bitchy," just slap me and tell me to move on...I'll get the picture!

      As I look through the posts here, I have noticed strangely the different subjects that have a lot pf comments.  Obviously, a lot of comments are good (can I and have I stressed that enough?), and a lot of comments means there is a lot of conflict and different opinions in those areas.  For instance, one area being the dispute over Reagan's face on the 10, the other major one being the Lawyer/Doctor thing.  I just find it interesting the things that we all find different, and yet those differences seem to keep us together.  That's just my word. Oh...and sorry for being cranky on here lately...I've had a lot of stuff bugging me...so I would like to publicly apologize for that ;-)

      Ya the Reagan death week thing is over, but here's something that isn't.  I know cause I just heard about it on The Daily Show.  Putting his face on the 10 dollar bill is still an issue.  I'll say right now there's going to be no reason to take sides. I just want to bring someone to your attention.  The man working to bring his face to the 10 dollar bill says his reasoning is because Hamilton has been honored for about 80 years now.  And he's the only one on money who isn't a president. Therefore, Reagan should be on the 10 instead of him. Well, I would like to bet a 100 bucks that that's not true.

      Due to verbal negative feedback on  Mixing Sports...with Josh Hall , I'm afraid it may have to be cancelled.  The producers have found that people just aren't interested in these sort of things, especially when you mix it with technology, but before they cancel it, they would like to take a poll.    If you would like to keep the articles the way they are:        1.)Leave a comment stating that you like them  If you would like to change the articles in some way:        2.)Leave a comment stating your ideas  If you would like the show to be eliminated because you don't feel it would be read enough for anybody to care:        3.)Leave a comment stating that you want it cancelled  Yes...I'm mainly being funny, but I do want you to participate in the "poll."  I don't want to waste my...or your...time looking up information and putting it on here if only one person is going to read and comment on it.  Once again...mainly being funny, but am serious as well. -Thanks!

      OK...I'm sure that you have all scrolled down through this EXTENSIVE list...but have everyone taken the time to actually read some of this stuff?  For the newcomers, like Barbie and Ambur, I ask that you go through all of the blogs, at least pick out the one's that interest you, and   LEAVE COMMENTS  . The whole point of this is to hear each other's views on different topics...so if you don't leave comments...then it will fail, or at least post a new post about something.  I'm not being crabby...at least i'm not trying to be, I'm just stating that if you don't leave comments, even on topics you're not sure about but have feelings for, then none of us will have anything else to build off.  Thanks for listening to little ol me!

      As the creator of the ring, I want to keep things fresh so people keep reading and posting and commenting and checking it out.  As part of keeping things going, I want to alert you all to the season premiere of Newlyweds.  There isn't anything that I can find that is wrong with this show.  For guys, you got the greatest looking woman in showbiz.  I have never seen someone look so good in Abercrombie sweats.  For girls, I know you all are checking out Nick's guns.  So please, everyone here watch this show so we can keep some quality on TV.

      I know. I complain about this a LOT. But i honestly dont like babysitting very much. Okay...take that back. I like babysitting..within reason. Every day from 12:30 (when drivers ed gets out) till 9 at night is  not  within reason. I've babysat for these people (i'm here right now) for about..three years i guess. I've practically raised these kids. Their parents are freakin workaholics and it breaks my heart when they're kids are like "yay! i get to see my dad on tuesday!"..when it's only friday.   My sister watches two kids from a different family. (Not meaning to build off of spencer's blog here but..) Their dad is a doctor..and she gets paid less then two dollars an hour. (The normal going rate is 5-7 dollars). Meaning that when she was at their house for thirteen hours, nd fed their kids breakfast, lunch, nd supper, she got $25. Sucks, right?  Little girls are the worst to babysit. Especially around the age of 3-5. They have this idea that they are the BOSS of the house when their parents are gone. It's tough work telling her that I, in fact, am the BOSS. But sometimes you have to give in and let her be the BOSS. Or get online..and let her sit on the couch and pretend to have a baby. Honestly, that's what she's doing. The other little girl is going "oh..i already have a hundred of  those . Crazy.  Little boys are better then that. They're content with watching Reading Rainbow and playing with electronic light up weed-wackers. Complete with REAL SPINNING BLADE! No joke. It's made out of rubber.   I know can always say NO to babysitting. But i dont have a "real job" and i need money once in a while. Unfortunately, i wish this were  like  a real job and i could call of sick today. Nick's going to my house at 3:30 to paint our basement for us..and i want to be there! But no, i'm stuck till 9 ish. Hopefully I'll get more then 25 bucks.

      This has been an ongoing thing for a while, but now it's reached a new high.  Now I'm aware of the fact that lawyers aren't really held in too high esteem with the public, but what's going on now is blatant discrimination.  Doctors in certain areas across the country are refusing service to lawyers AND their families due to an increase in malpractice suits.  WHAT?!  Lawyers are supposed to be held to some moral and ethical standard right?  Aren't doctors supposed to be held to that same standard?  They both have a duty to do their job. It's the JOB of a lawyer to take cases.  Whether it's prosecuting or defending, they are doing their JOB.  By refusing service to lawyers and their families they are effectively doing the exact opposite of what their job is supposed to be.  You know, I wanna be a lawyer.  I wanna help people.  That's what doctors are supposed to do too, but they won't because of malpractice suits.  Well, if doctors didn't commit malpractice, then this wouldn't happen.  Oh, did I mention the reason that doctors are so upset about malpractice suits?  It's not because they're worried about hurting people, it's not because of their repuation being ruined.  These "moral" and "ethical" doctors are complaining about increased insurance premiums as a result of these suits. Yes, the same doctors that are refusing service to lawyers are complaining because they have to pay more for not doing their own job right.  I refer you to the title of my post.

      I was sitting here thinking.  I do that often.  And I made a connection between two events that have happened.  I was reminded of something my elementary teacher taught me called cause and effect.  When one thing happens, another thing happens in response to it.  It's hard to pinpoint situations like that in the world, but I believe I have found one.  And because I have, it's only right that an apology is issued to family of the hostage currently being held at gunpoint.  You see, the al-Qaeda man with the gun said, "We have our legal right to treat [hostages] the same way they treat our people," he added. "We will publish more details about the man kidnapped and explain the mujahedeen's demands."  If anyone cares, the mujahedeen are a group of Islamic militants.  That being said...  Dear To Whom It May Concern,  I have had little to no sleep over the past month due to the horrid crime I committed in the prison.  It was only complicated when I heard of the disaster that your family became a part of.  I recognized that man's interrogation technique because I used that exact same harsh manner with a man who was a terrorist.  I can only imagine what you are thinking with all of the video and news coverage that is going on.  I have experience so I can only imagine that he is not being allowed to sleep, eat, or relax in any way, not to mention it's tough when being held at gunpoint.  I have realized the consequence that my actions have had on your family. Had I not taken pictures and played foolish games with the prisoners, Paul may have still been safe in Saudi Arabia.  No matter what, my heart goes out to you.    Sincerely,  The Anonymous Rough Interrogator Writing From Inside a Prison  God bless.

      Okay, here's something different than dumb news items.  I found this site that basically narrows it all down.  You got your South Beach Diet, your Atkins diet, your Jenny Craig, your eDiets.com diet,etc.  It all can become confusing so for anyone interested in eating healthy here's a website that narrows down the basic idea for any decent diet.  (http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101040621-650746,00.html?cnn=yes)  DISCLAIMER: None of you are fat so this is by no means a response to someone's obesity.  But I do think Allison was talking about the South Beach diet once before so say she is interested in eating healthy this might be something interesting to look at. Same goes for anyone else.

      At one point in the night, there's a time where you can do nothing about not having sleep.  It's when the birds come out and start chirping.  The coffee starts dripping.  And the sun is about to rise...  I am stuck here at 5:30 am without the luxury of being asleep.  And it sucks!  I don't know what it is but I had nothing better to do.  So I wrote about it.  Hey, there's music videos on.  Beyonce's hot.  I can't even try to sleep because my mind just races around and I feel insane.  Scary?  Yes very.  Alright I'll stop.

      OK...yes..now maybe I'm overdoing it...but this was of interest to me because of the religious aspect now.  I feel Josh Rendall and other "relgious believers" may find this interesting.  Apparently a deacon of a christian church has come forward with the idea of selling christian bobbleheads to promote athletics in religious activities.  Yes, he has started selling these bobbleheads to help the christian community participation in professional athletic events and to even start their own teams.  So far a hockey team and some other team has been formed from his doings.  He stated that he thought it was time that religion was made a bigger part of sports!  Thats my word...peace out!

      I think this is something at least majority of you can enjoy; however, I must warn you that not everything here I wrote! I'll put a dash in front of everything that I wrote ;-)  -When the Charlotte Bobcats open their $265 million arena next year, Barry Silberman expects there will be skepticism about the invisible innovation that will be floating all around the fans.  -He's talking about Wi-Fi, which stands for wireless fidelity and allows users to wirelessly access the Internet via laptops and PDAs. Hotels, airports and coffee shops have become commonplaces for these WiFi Hotspots.   -He's suggesting it's going to be common in sports too: In about five years, he says, any arena or stadium that hasn't gone Wi-Fi will be the "exception."  While venues testing Wi-Fi have already ranged from  Purdue's football stadium , the Sacramento River Cats' minor league baseball park and the NFL Pittsburgh Steelers' stadium, the San Francisco Giants' stadium might be the most Wi-Fi-enabled sports site.   Says Giants chief information officer Bill Schlough: "It's like walking into Starbucks. Except our Wi-Fi is free."  - The idea is that fans can go online and access content such as historical videos, trivia games and real-time statistics that's on the Internet or through customized material available only in the stadium. Eventually, the club hopes to let fans order concessions by Wi-Fi. Just to note...McDonalds is supposed to do this the year we graduate ;-)  Although only about 200 fans a games now use the Giants' Wi-Fi, Schlough admits there is backlash: "There's a lot of purist fans who scoff at anybody bringing laptops to games. I've been heckled when I go in the stands. But then they'll end up wanting to look over your shoulder."  But even Schlough isn't always pleased: "The real problem is business people coming and doing their office e-mails at the game."  Rich Mayberry, a co-founder of Orlando-based Kosmos Studios, worked with the Giants and the Steelers. In 2003 the Steelers equipped luxury suites and club seats with Wi-Fi, allowing fans to wirelessly call up four different TV camera angles. But the big Wi-Fi use, he says, came from kids playing online games: "And when the parents wanted to see things, the kids wouldn't let them on."  -Silberman notes the Wi-Fi arena also could help first responders communicate in an emergency and even improve cell phone reception throughout the venue. He suggests a Wi-Fi "killer app" (as in the winning option) will be a fan's access to TV replays that might not even be available on TV, although he wants to avoid any unnecessary "intrusions" on fans.  -Now...what's funny about this is that our own High School now has WiFi in the CAVE that is accessible to anyone who comes to the basketball games or anything held in there now.  So...does that make us "special" and "sport history-making" too?   Just thought some of you might enjoy this!  Now...I'm not going to overdo it, but I figured I could add some of my character to this blog by bringing in "technology news" from around the world maybe once a week.  If you get bored with it...tell me.  Not all of them will be this long of course...this just seemed special because of the amount of interest it would bring in from everyone on the site!

      OK...when you're 16 years old and dealing with problems of your own, is it reasonable to be asked to be a parent for a year?  How about 6?  Maybe 12?  I don't know if any of you have had this problem, but I have my share of it and am quite sick of it.  Parenting is a thing for "Parents", wow, what a concept, not for their 16 year old son.  Life is tough, we all know it, our parents should know it too.  They have had plenty of experiences with life and how cruel and hard it can be, sooooooo, shouldn't they know how to deal with it a little bit better than say, our age of people?  Sure, watching your siblings for a few hours is fine, correcting them during that time is fine, but when your parents are there and PERFECTLY capable of doing all of that for themselves while you could be off doing something like...WORK (wait, maybe that's just me)...then why should they be able to complain about life and leave your siblings to you, especially when you have a younger sibling who is old enough to start taking over some responsibilities that you have had since, maybe,  5 !  I don't know if any of you are going to agree with me because none of you have probably had to deal with this, but I believe that there comes a time in a teenagers life when a parent should not be able to hold their son back from going and having a good time just because they can't deal with their 2 youngest children!!!!!!  As usual, I would always appreciate your comments on this matter.  Maybe I'm just being a baby, but frankly....I think they've just gone a bit too far!

      I know how you all feel about news being posted.  Truth is... I don't care.  On this page now, I have posted what is a picture of a normal American citizen being held at gunpoint.  He will be killed in 72 hours unless al Qaeda prisoners are let go.  He also wants Westerners to leave the area now.  Saudi Arabia does have a policy of not negotiating with terrorists.  But God willing, the country hopes to do whatever they can to return him to his family safely.  "We have our legal right to treat [hostages] the same way they treat our people," it added. "We will publish more details about the man kidnapped and explain the mujahedeen's demands."  Apparently, the crown  prince said not fighting back would be against the Saudis religion.   For people like Ambur, I understand that this posting is already too long.  And I am deeply sorry, but for the family of this American, I urge you to stay tuned to this story.  Do it to understand the type of terror that exists.  And above all, God bless our troops.   Here's the most recent  urlLink Article  for all who care!

      I haven't had a chance to say too much on The Local Cafe.  I have been thinking of something to write about and I thought that I would ask anybody who would like to help with me and many others efforts to help the teen population in our country.  Many of you know, I listen to the Christian stations on the radio and tv.  I have been praying that our teen population will live a good, properous life without the use of drugs, illicit materials, etc.  I'm not asking those who don't agree with me to bash me for putting something on that deals with religion; I'm asking those who would like to live a good life the right way to do so and ask others to as well.

Kevin has given you a one week free trial of being an administrator to get out there and invite our other people!  Now...you may have the power, but do you know how to use it?  Of course not, not even I knew for the first 30 seconds, so lets begin class!   INVITING PEOPLE 101   Course No : 1  Length : As long as you make it  Â° of Difficulty : As tough as you make it  OK...first...copy & paste the next link but  DO NOT CLICK IT  into a new browser window and push enter http://blogspot.com/app/options_members.pyra?blogID=7245899  Then...just click "Add Team Members" and enter their email addresses  You're done!  Congratulations...you have justsurvivedd the worst class of your entire educational careers.  Now...DO NOT WORRY ABOUT SENDING MULTIPLE EMAILS TO THE SAME PERSON...this is a technique that we here like to call  annoyance .  It works quite well.  So go out there and get us some more people!!!

      I'm looking at my clock.  It's about 9:25 in the PM.  Although this post will show a different time because that's just the way things work here at the Local Cafe.  So, in about 2 and a half hours we will have reached our one week mark.  But wait!  Technically, that's not true cause I didn't post anything at 12 AM on Tuesday last week.  I did post something at about 11:30 AM.  Alright who cares about all that BS...  I really like what you all have made possible.  I'm proud of what's happened over the week and I don't mean to sound cocky or anything but I enjoy posting and commenting and discussing stuff here.  I don't know about you, you can let me know.  But we're missing people! People that have made me what I am today and I am always happy to be around.  So here's a challenge... Let's get Allison Gill, Ambur Taylor, and Isabel Fraga in here before we hit the 2 week mark.  It's possible.  I am going to make you all administrators for a week so you can send invitations to them.  Let's go!

      (THIS BY NO MEANS MEANS THAT I DO NOT FEEL SORRY THAT SHE DIED)  It's awful that now I have a hard time figuring out whether or not certain trials are important or not.  Right now, the one that I keep hearing about seems to be just a murder.  I mean, stuff like this happens here in Indiana but it doesn't make frontpage like Laci Peterson's death did.  Yet, America is concerned with it. What's so special about it?  There's two possibilities: She was walking a dog and was abducted or she was killed at home and then dumped into the San Francisco Bay.  Or wait there's one other possibility... It's far out but people haven't considered it.  Seeing how they considered all this other garbage maybe they should throw this in.  Because they've considered his alibi that he was fishing... which if I did murder someone, I wouldn't tell them I was fishing considering that she washed onto the shores two miles from where he said he was fishing.  Scott Peterson doesn't even know what he was fishing for.  On top of that, it's been said the way they are testing the hair found on the boat is flawed.  Possibly satanic cult connections?  Defense guesses that maybe the killer dumped it to link it to Scott because he could be linked.  So here's the far out idea.  I think a girl and a baby just like Laci Peterson and her baby came up on shore.  And Scott his hiding the real Laci somewhere in San Francisco.  Anyways... Put his ass in the slammer!  I know too much about this stupid trial.  It's just not that important.

      You know what...it's ok to have beliefs on what your daughter or son can or can't do.  It's not ok to force them to do stuff when you don't even have custody over them.  I wanna know...Did this girl have a problem saying the pledge or was it all the Atheist dad's problem?  I'd venture to say it was him.    Adding on, I never agreed with this.  And I know the rest of The Local Cafe will go along with what I say.  If we're keeping the Founding Fathers on money, then we have to keep the Pledge of Allegiance.  It's a historical piece that would be missed if it wasn't used in schools.  Hey, if you can't say "under God" cause of your religion, then don't.  I haven't been or heard of any place that forced kids to say it.  Except I do think that all kids should know it word for word along with Star Spangled Banner and even America the Beautiful.    Well, it reached Washington D.C. and if you're denied there, you have nowhere else to go.  It's over. No matter what we can say "under God" in school.

      As I read these posts by Kevin, of which I have to say are EXCELLENT, not because of his view on them...but because of the way he presents them, I am noticing how much just our little group is disputing this thing over the change in currency.  I read all of your comments and there were some pretty powerful things said, which is good, thats the purpose of this thing, but is it really worth it?  Yes, Reagan, did some great things and was a VERY good man, and yes, Clinton did some great things too, but do they deserve to be on the money...maybe.  I'm kind of stuck between two of my best friends here...I agree with Kevin on some subjects, and I can agree with Josh R. on some opinions, but personally, I know you're all going to shoot me for saying this, but it doesn't really matter to me.  If they change it they had better the heck have a good reason for changing it, if they don't change it, they had better the heck have a good place to put the money that they were going to spend on changing the currency.  I'm no government/politic smart guy, I'll be the first tell you that, and sadly I never have cared much for politics because of my family upbringing, but this stuff does matter to me.  Am I going in circles?  I don't know...but I just figured I'd put my view in here to see what you all think.  To finish my thought(s) here, my opinion is that there have been several more impactful people on this country then Reagan...yes...once again..he was a good man...but other people have been good men on this land too.  Keep the currency the same, give all of the "good men" a nice little award or monument or something like that, and put the "money" to good use somewhere else.

      I looked at the poll when they were trying to figure out whether or not to change the face on the 10 dollar bill.  From the argument between Spencer and I, I do believe it's reasonable to be split.  I'm not saying I don't think you're right Spencer.  I'm just saying if I had to pick between heads or tails (heads being new ppl) (tails being stay the same) I would go with heads.  Really though the opinions are split 50/50.

      (As told by Ronald P. Reagan (his son) in his eulogy)  One day, dad decided to revive the thumbs up gesture. So, he went all over the country of course giving everybody the thumbs up. I found myself in the presidential limousine one day returning from a big event. Dad was of course thumbs upping the crowd. All of a sudden, looming in the window was this snarling face.  Reviving an entirely different hand gesture, he hoisted an entirely different digit in our direction.  Dad saw this and said, "You see, I think it's catching on."

      George Washington was the first president.  He led some wars.  Started up government from scratch... and made us America.  Lincoln ended slavery.  Andrew Jackson was... I bet many don't even remember what he did.  Did he do anything?  Hamilton?  Who the?  What?  Oh... It's pretty sad when most people can't identify with the people on their own currency.  You know why people like state quarters?  It gives them a reason to be proud.  America's a gimmick.  Home of the Brave...Land of the Free... Everything in America has to have meaning.  Putting new people on money would give meaning.  And yes, no one dealt with terror, gun control, pollution, etc...Why?  They were too busy exploring lands, fighting over it, and slaughtering natives.

      Since when do amendments have anything to do with money? Last time I checked the only thing linking them was the fact that we pay congressmen money to spend time "attempting" to pass amendments.    So we're giving credit to founding fathers for building this country?  Hmm looks like they did a pretty crappy job.  Gun control, war, terror, welfare issues, medicare issues, white house trauma, voting problems, pollution, etc.  Yep...way to go Washington.  You should be proud.  Let's be honest.  We're as close to the shitter as you can get without having to sit down on it.    America needs new life.  One way to do it is to change the money.

Andy's brother Kevin called here and said that he was going to school in Mishawaka this year.  Which means... Andy will be back.  For some reason, I thought Andy wasn't in touch with you guys so I wanted to see the look on some of your faces when he just showed up.  Because I know the look would be a happy one.  Well, I just got done golfing and I didn't have much sleep last night.  I am really tired plus I hit some awful shots.  Like I don't care if you aren't very good, I hit some that were just incredibly bad.  Well, Later!

       Olympic Athletes to Be Given Free Condoms   Athletes at next month's Athens Olympics are expected to go for gold in the bedroom as well as on the field, with 130,000 free condoms being made available throughout the Games.   Condom manufacturer Durex has donated the prophylactics as well as 30,000 sachets of lubricant for the August 13-29 Olympics, "to smooth the performance of the world's elite sports people in the arena and under the covers," it said in a statement.   The condoms will be available to over 17,000 athletes and officials at the pharmacy of the athletes' Olympic village.   "The condoms will come in an individual pack, with an instruction leaflet in various languages," said a spokeswoman for Durex Greece.    "We have discussed the numbers with the organizing committee and we think they are realistic as we know from previous Olympics that athletes do come into contact during the Games."    In the Sydney 2000 Games, each competing athlete was given 51 condoms on arrival at the Olympic Village, but another 20,000 had to be shipped in when supplies began to run low.     This is funny but the best part is the fact that they will be individually packed with an instructions leaflet in various languages.  If you're an athlete who gets it on often, I want to think that you know how to use a condom.  But then again, this might be your first introduction to safe sex.  So for all Olympians who need the instructions... Maybe you should practice putting it on or else you might piss off your partner.   One thing's for sure, we definitely don't want an AIDS outbreak at the Olympics.

      Hello.  Good morning!  I had an awesome time at the movie last night.  I have to compliment Barbie.  You did an awesome job.  I think you should be the leader for the girls.  Maybe they can tell you when they are free and want to do something and if they can go somewhere, you can be the one to let me know.  No... but ya, great time and it was also interesting cause I guess the theater had computer problems going on.  I also saw Aaron Wonderly who was in the same movie with us.  Saw Isabel at the theater too but most people here probably knew she was going to a movie.  I loved the movie.  It was nice seeing everyone especially Barbie, who I think I hadn't seen since school was out.

Instead of figuring out him, I more so allowed him to understand me more.  At least, that's what it looks like.  But I actually talked to Josh tonight.  I told him my problems.  He responded.  He says we're good now.  And I feel better cause I was true to myself and honest.  Thanks for putting up with it.  Everything's good now.

      I don't see why you're telling me that I don't know any other religions.&nbsp; My mother works with all of the world church denominations.&nbsp; Through that, I've learned alot about those other religions.&nbsp; It's makes sense to me and other that Christianity is my religion of choice.&nbsp; I can sit and think about all the other religions, but to me there's no reason not to believe.&nbsp; There's a reason that it's called faith; you put everything on the religion you believe in.  Nothing that is in the Bible has been disproven, that's just one thing that gives me a reason that I believe more fully than ever.&nbsp; It only makes sense to believe what's in it.&nbsp; People are different today, but the principles stated in the Bible are the same.&nbsp; That's the beauty to it.&nbsp; Everything still relates to the present day.  It's different from being a person who just believes in Jesus and someone who practices Christianity and has Jesus in their heart.&nbsp; I think that's a difference when you say you were always part of the family.&nbsp; Jesus says that if somebody is only half committed to him, it's just as bad as not being committed to him at all.&nbsp; That's the family that I was praying that you and Spencer would come in to.&nbsp; The one that's fully committed to the Lord.&nbsp; I know that it takes time, but that's the family that I hope everybody becomes part of.&nbsp; You never know when you'll die and stand in the face of God.&nbsp; That's why it's just as important to practice now, instead of waiting until you become older and "settle down".

       Political people love to party and while security will be in full swing so will the prostitutes.    "Every convention brings in more people, and women fly in from all over the country to work it," said Robyn Few, a prostitute on probation who runs the Sex Workers Outreach Project, an advocacy group.   "There will be girls from California and from the South in Boston this week," she said. "I hope a lot of women make a lot of money and make a lot of men really happy."    For weeks, escort services have plastered advertisements in magazines and on the Internet asking women to work the convention. Even local strip clubs are putting out the word that more women are needed.    "We are looking for more girls right now," said Frank Caswell, who runs the Foxy Lady club outside Boston. "Obviously, hospitality and beauty are expected and the girls must bring something that is enticing to see."    Local agencies said they charge anywhere from $200 an hour for a little company in a delegate's hotel room; rates at national agencies can be five times that much.     Okay really if you ask anyone there they will say they brought their family.  But that didn't stop Clinton from enjoying himself.  Democrats love to party. There will be hos for EVERYONE!  Just having them for company will make a tight-assed politician happy.

      Two things you have to understand:    1. I wasn't raised on religion. 2. I was always part of the family.   (1) Unlike some, I didn't and still don't regularly go to church.  I am part of Younglife Campaigners now and I think that's a great way for me to get involved with faith.  But the only times I was involved in church were weddings, funerals, and other events like my cousin had an orchestra thing at St. Mary's once.  So let me compare myself with Josh.  Josh was born and I would guess he started going to church when he was very young like 3-5 maybe earlier.  So as his mind is growing, he's learning the Bible, learning about Jesus, and learning everything about religion in general.  He doesn't need to question it.  It's all he knows.  And when you're raised on it, it's correct.  But I've heard about Catholicism and Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Zen-Buddhism, Zionism, etc.  Who knows which one's correct?  It's important to have faith but when you aren't raised on it, deciding what's right is hard.  Plus, you throw my interest in government in there and then you have separation of church and state.  That's whole 'nother discussion right there.  Thing is...I can't commit to practicing it.  I can commit to confiding in Jesus Christ.  I can stop at moments in the day and say, "Dear God...thank you for the life I have. Amen."  I think that's my first step to being awakened and beginning a journey into the world of Christianity.  Someday I will have a total understanding.  I just don't know if it will happen now.   {Whew! Go get a drink.  Use the bathroom.  Get up and stretch or something.  That was rough.  Anyone still reading? I encourage you to continue on.)   (2) I'll never forget being at Younglife.  I remember feeling so right for making the decision I made.  And then we got to the bus and Josh Rendall stopped me.  He pulled me together and prayed for me and welcomed me to the family.  Well, I was always a part of it.  I just fit under the category of "born-again" now.  I always was worried about sinning in front of God.  I always was trying to do the right thing for God.  I just never took it seriously enough to think about practicing it. It's important to have faith.  Let's take George W. Bush for instance.  He had severe problems before he turned 40.  He was an alcoholic.  He had no direction in his life.  He wasn't living up to his potential.  Then he opened his mind and began to read the Bible and look where it got him.  There's no question that every person should practice faith.  Just I like to live freely.  So it's going to be tough to follow the Bible to the detail.  But life is a journey to Heaven.  You start off young and live freely.  You begin to settle down as you get older.  Then you turn 70, and you're reading the Bible every night or talking with religious people daily.  So the way I see it...I've got plenty of time to grow religiously.    There it is.  You don't need my permission to comment.  Just remember, it's not strange for me to be religious live freely.  I don't see why that's so surprising.  People have changed since the year 0 (zero).  There's no way we can be like the people who Jesus lived with.  But that doesn't mean we can't trust in him like the people did.

      *NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS ONE PARTICULAR PERSON  The only year everyone should care what's happening is when a presidential election is coming.  I've lately become a political nut.  I could offer my thoughts on any subject or ask for your thought whenever.  But I won't because it's the summer.  And I agree with Paige who told me...It's worth it to know but it's the summer and I don't care.  That doesn't work with me because I like knowing what's going on.  And you think watching the news works.  Nope, sorry.  CNN..FOX...MSNBC...no one watches that on their own.  Look at the newspaper?  Ya, the classifieds and the movie/tv section.  Comic strips too.  The one place you can get news is your homepage.  It'll appear when you sign on.  Lance Armstrong won (sixth time in a row).  That's great.  The French are spitting on him.  Did you know that? Probably not.  There are some conventions where the candidates will spend time and then be nominated.  9/11 commission says our intelligence sucks.  Important stuff any person who wants to be a decent citizen should know. Here's what I've figured out:  I'm sorry if you have the privilege to vote this year.  Because you get to choose between the bad and the badder.  Bad english but it's the truth.  Now, you'd be surprise to know that you can laugh at this stuff and get news at the same time in a cool way.  Jon Stewart and Michael Moore are excellent.  The reason people think they aren't giving the truth is because it's either shocking or funny.  Well, a lot of things happening are funny cause they shouldn't be happening.  Rock the Vote is cool.  SNL skits are awesome.  Young people need to pay attention.  If you don't get interested, this fall check out the news once a week.  Just a suggestion.

      My philosophy behind this is... Each time I want to do something, I am going to ask a different person when they are going to be free.  That way nobody is always left out.  I post the plan about three or four days ahead of time.  I did with Anchorman, Spider Man 2, and I posted a week in advance the date for Dodgeball.  Then as we close in, I IM people to let them know that it's still happening.  I then begin to call people on the phone.  It's very complicated and I can't help but be happy when things work out.  Like Anchorman, the 4th time planned and it was awesome.  I was so happy to be there.  Now I don't think it's fair for people to blow up at me when they can't go.  I would like to ask you to not get angry with me because right now I don't have the power to be able to just know when you are free.  I don't have anyone's calendar so I don't know where you will be this week or the next.  I do my best.  On the issue of inviting people and surprising you, I don't think it matters.  I showed up with Demi.  You didn't know.  Well, here's an added perk.  You get to see an old friend.  (One that I enjoy talking with any chance I get.)  I showed up with Rachael.  Okay, Josh R...I can understand how that might peeve you but I'm really good friends with her now.  And she's a part of my life now and with Demi, here's a surprise perk.  Meet Rachael...you've seen her in German and she really likes hanging with people like us.  I love planning things and getting people together.  I don't work a job.  I don't usually have very busy days.  That's why I come up with all these things to do and then try to plan them.  If you can't do them, just say no.  You aren't out of the group if you miss something.  Well that's what I think.  You don't need my permission to comment.

      I have to admit, I've made some mistakes.  I shouldn't have insulted your family when you couldn't go to Spider Man 2.  I shouldn't expect you to know in less than a half hour if you can go somewhere.  And I shouldn't lead you on.  There are some things that you need to know the truth about.  The way I handle religion, is something you should know otherwise, you're going to wrestle with it.  My thoughts on G.W. lol well, I will lay those out too.  Michael Moore... I know you don't agree with what he does.  I will tell you about movie planning.  I'm not going to hold back anything.  This is what I think and knowing what I truly feel will allow you to handle me better.  I just ask this and this is for everybody:  Just because I don't agree with it...doesn't mean you can't talk about it in front of me.  I still haven't forgotten the time when Barbie and Preston were hooking up.  I still kind of had a thing for Barbie and you all knew it.  You kept it from me cause nobody wants to hurt cute little Kevin.  Well, I want to be a man about things now.  Let's not be foolish.  We're all friends and we don't need to hide things like that.  You're all great.  Can't say that enough...Keep enjoying the summer!

      I have had so much fun with my relatives lately and I love writing about it.  Today we went to breakfast at Tradewinds.  11 people there laughing and being disruptive while we pig out on excellent food.  Good times.  And then we came up with something we could go out and do.  At first, we thought Putt Putt... then it became a trip to the movies.  I was happy to go of course.  Except I had a tough choice on my hands.  One of the hardest decisions I have had to make lately.  I had to choose between Day After Tommorow and Dodgeball because our group was splitting up and going to both.  I hadn't seen Day After Tommorow and the movie's effects made me want to go but then again the story seemed hokey.  But I was sure about Dodgeball.  That movie is so freakin hilarious.  Naturally, I picked Dodgeball and I made the right decision.  The adults in my family watched it and found the movie to be incredibly hokey.  I'll stick with Independence Day.    We also made a trip to Barnes & Noble.  Great place ...I had a giant coffee and some great laughs.  I found this book of bunny suicides and it's just great.  Any animal rights activist will hate this book, but I would say loosen your panties and laugh it up.  I'm gonna buy it and show to you all sometime.  Bunny Suicides...  Well, great day.  I'm happy I can laugh and enjoy being with relatives.  Otherwise, life would suck.

      Yea&nbsp;most of it just has to do with communication.&nbsp; Just telling people who's coming, yea, sometimes bothers me.&nbsp; I think when it's someone unexpected (outside the "group") it's just hard to grasp.&nbsp; Sometimes its hard to know if we're going to cause a problem by bringing something up, etc.&nbsp; I don't care if you watch the Daily Show, believe Micheal Moore, etc.; that's your choice.&nbsp; Nobody said that I would agree with it.&nbsp; Respect is a big deal and will get you a long way in life.&nbsp; I may not agree with what people think or say, but I have to have an open mind and respect that opinion.&nbsp; When it comes to someone's opinions about a subject, even the &nbsp; President, of course I don't agree with some of&nbsp;those opinions, but I don't take that as a personal attack.&nbsp; I think that's what you end up doing sometimes Kev.&nbsp; I don't think you mean to, but when someone has a different opinion, you take it personally especially on the blog.&nbsp; I think that's what you see in my eyes that&nbsp;is frustrating&nbsp;to me about you.&nbsp; The thing is, though,&nbsp;you can't get upset.&nbsp; It's too hard to worry about what's different about everybody.&nbsp; It's not worth it.&nbsp; You have to compromise and have fun.&nbsp; You just have to live on and respect other people.&nbsp; That way you can have some fun with friends and not have to worry about everyone getting upset over simple disagreements.

      I understand what you're saying about differences.  It makes sense until a bunch piles on and before you know it, you have your friend worrying about you.  So do me something if possible...the first post I made were arguments for you.  It's what I thought your problems with me were.  Could you tell me if I am off or on and add any I missed?  I got your emails.  I will continue in the direction I was going soon.

      I got back today from my 24 hour bike ride that I took with my dad (he pooped out so I finished it by myself the other 13 hours, lol) in Indy.&nbsp; I came directly here to see what had developed and I must say that I&nbsp;am sooo relieved to see that everyone is doing ok still.&nbsp; After my bad experience with this thing after my vacation to TN, this was very nice.&nbsp; I'm glad to see that problems are getting resolved peacefully and to see growth both in our friendships and innerselfs too.&nbsp;  Also...I've got a bad update for y'all.&nbsp; Spt. Mills had decided (lol) that school shall open on time after all.&nbsp; There are currently about 9 classrooms in the Auditorium (I think 3 on the balcony, 5 on the floor (where the seats used to be), and maybe, MAYBE, one on the stage).&nbsp; I hope I didn't burst anyone's bubble!  Also...I'd like to be the first to say that if anyone is mad at me for any reason of which I know that you would know if you were mad at me and for what, I did not make the decision on any biases or any other deciding factor.&nbsp; I simply went with the choice that I felt would work best for what was needed to be done.&nbsp; Maybe something new will come up this year requiring another decision to be made, but don't get any hopes up!

      Kev, first I'd like to say that I never really am upset that much to put a crack in our friendship.&nbsp; I mean people all have differences in their lives and we have to overcome them.&nbsp; If I have been angry at you and/or about you, it never lasts.&nbsp; I always just let it go and keep on going, it's nothing that I would hate you for.&nbsp; Now you might think differently about me and how I act, but I thought I'd just let you know that.

      For everyone to know... Sometimes the blog becomes screwy and problems happen.  It becomes hard to tell if your comment actually made it onto the blog.  I read Spencer's comments, and he had three of them that all said the same thing.  I promise you that I wouldn't take someone's right to post something on this page away from them.  But just because they were all the same, I removed two of the three.    Sorry Barbie...

       I couldn't be more honest.&nbsp; Right now, I just feel like telling my friends about what I did today.&nbsp; This morning I woke up and could barely move.&nbsp; But my relatives from Minnesota are here, so that sort of worked as motivation to get up and start my day.&nbsp; I had a nice breakfast.&nbsp; My mom made eggs and bacon and there also was chocolate banana bread and freshly baked bread too.&nbsp; I then started Zoolander.&nbsp; I bought it for about 2 dollars and all I want to do right now is finish it.&nbsp; It could be awful and I wouldn't care because Ben Stiller and Will Ferrell rock!&nbsp; I didn't get to finish it because the lock on our van wasn't working and my uncle called to have me drive over Malibu's Most Wanted.&nbsp; (*For some reason my family is hooked on it.&nbsp; I don't like it that much.)&nbsp;     &nbsp;  I then had a family reunion.&nbsp; Now, before I left, I thought I was going to like a park and we were going to have a cookout and it was going to be some shindig at Potato Creek or something.&nbsp; Nope, we pulled in and we were on the farm.&nbsp; Outhouse, tractors, grills, NASCAR....and my mind went "You might be a redneck if..."&nbsp;.&nbsp; I soon forgot all that and I ate for about an hour nonstop.&nbsp; Being on the farm, they crew their on corn and it was good.&nbsp; There also were some great things to eat that other people had brought.&nbsp; I played horseshoes which is fun but it gets a little boring after a while.&nbsp; The best part was hearing all the people from 60-70 years old laugh about being old.&nbsp; Of course there was that person who talks to you and makes&nbsp;you think &nbsp;"who the hell are you?", but for the most part, it was fun.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Following that, we moved the party to my aunt's house and I taught the family how to play Texas Hold'em.&nbsp; We then played a game called 13 which I'd like to play with friends sometime.&nbsp; I'm back home and I'm happy to have such and entertaining and loving family.

      I warned that this would take a long time.&nbsp; When I said that, I had a plan for where I was going.&nbsp; It doesn't look like it's going to amount to anything because I planned on taking a long time.&nbsp; You all (Spencer and Ambur) have said things that I agree with.&nbsp; And because I chose to do this here, I have to accept what you say.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean I have to follow it.&nbsp; Look...if Josh Rendall had told me if he wants to meet in person to finish this or let me continue here, I could end this soon.&nbsp; But it's going to last at least until Sunday night.&nbsp; I am sorry that people have to deal with this.&nbsp;

      ok... i can totally see ur point kevin... but josh i think u have to realize ur unusual... obviously u were blessed with 'rents that care s0o0o much and family to be s0o0o0 much into the whole family thing. Urs has not been split up by divorce, adultery, remarriage, and massive family additions or ne other random thing thats splits them up. so0o0o i think you could be a little more lenient on y some people dont believe in God as much as you do... and u should not blame neone for not giving themselves entirely. or try to tell them that they are doing something unholy or "giving themselves" to God and then sinning. And then blessing someones family who ur having a quarrel with b/c u dont think he is doing the right thing. I appreciate and admire you for standing up for God and ur family.  Kevin... i think ur taking this way outta hand. Theres obviously not a big enough problem for it to be ragged on entirely. its a difference of opinion thats it.. he believes in something that u dont entirely agree with and thats what makes life interesting and you should know that better than anyone.. thats what makes movies go... thats what makes them interesting thats what makes entertainment go altogether. S0o0o i think that u need to accept that ur bad at planning things (although i give you props for trying,b/c ur right no one else is giving the effort.) and just move on and be the best friends u can be with someone that u have awkward situations and sometimes little spats. i love u both.

      Alright Kevin, I haven't had too much chance to be on here, there's been alot of stuff going on around the house lately.&nbsp; I don't see why you would think that I wouldn't take you seriously, so here you go.&nbsp; I don't see the point in alot of what you were taking about.&nbsp; Like Spencer said, most of this is just a list of facts and information.&nbsp; I think that's part of the problem that we've been having, communication.&nbsp; In past couple weeks, I think the whole thing about making a plan an hour before you go and then going after people for not being able to go is absurd.&nbsp; People, to you, never contact to see what's going on but then you do it yourself.&nbsp; Maybe it was just a matter of events, it could be, but that seems to be something that has gone on lately.&nbsp; I know it may not seem a big deal to you about that Sunday night when you came over before Cedar Point, but you didn't call and then there was someone at my door at midnight.&nbsp; It really scared my family, and that's something that bothered me.&nbsp; Also the whole thing with inviting people places without anybody knowing is just an awkward sitatuation that could have been avoided with some simple communication of telling people what's going on.  I don't see why you attack my "skills" and that I wouldn't be able to live without them.&nbsp; Of course I couldn't.&nbsp; That's what makes a person who they are.&nbsp; I mean think about yourself, where would you be without the Entertainment world and the Internet?&nbsp; I really don't see why you continue to talk about my relationship with God.&nbsp; You supposedly have joined in the family of God, so I would think that you'd understand that I wouldn't live as myself without Him.&nbsp; Of course, that's a simple fact in my life.&nbsp; My family means the world to me, God created it for that reason.&nbsp; My family is structured just in a different way.&nbsp; I don't see why you need to attack them in any way.&nbsp;&nbsp; They have no reason to be.  It's obvious that your life has taken you in a different direction than what mine has.&nbsp; I know that you'd just like to call people up and get people together all the time, but sometimes people just can't go at your speed.&nbsp; I need time to sit and think to myself and talk with my family.&nbsp; Other people would probably agree with me.&nbsp;   Well that's about all I've got to say right now.&nbsp; I'm going to Chicago in the morning to send Matt off to Mexico for his mission trip.&nbsp; I won't be back until Sunday evening probably just to let everybody know.&nbsp; God bless ! and&nbsp;may my&nbsp;prayers are with everybody right now, especially you Kevin and your family.

      Ok so I just wanted to let everyone know...Lance Armstrong is my new hero.&nbsp; He participates in one of the most grueling sports in all of the sporting world.&nbsp; He completely DOMINATES cycling like no one else.&nbsp; Even in other sports, not one single person or team has shown as much dominance as he has.&nbsp; He's won the premiere event in his sport 5 straight times...and he's in route to 6 straight times.&nbsp;&nbsp; He's revitalized a sport that&nbsp;no one in&nbsp;the US probably had even heard or cared about.&nbsp; The thing that is the most impressive...this man is exhibiting all his dominance after surviving three different types of cancer.&nbsp; He was diagnosed with all three types at the same time, and not once did he give up.&nbsp; Unbelieveable.&nbsp; He has returned to full form if not better than he was before his sicknesses.&nbsp;This is quite possibly the greatest comeback story ever.&nbsp; If you want a story about not giving up and striving for your goals, look no further than Lance Armstrong.&nbsp; I have the utmost respect and admiration for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lance Armstrong is truly an inspiration story for everyone.

      Continuing what I set out to do,&nbsp; I must say that I respect you for the person you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wouldn't be your friend if I didn't like the things you do.&nbsp; I think that makes sense.&nbsp;   I think I'll start from the top and work my way down.&nbsp; I like the way God plays a part in your life.&nbsp; But that's nothing to be prideful about because many people have God in their life.&nbsp; More so, I admire the way you are loyal to Him and make an effort to live for Him each day.&nbsp; Some day I would like to have the strength to do that.&nbsp; I like your family.&nbsp; Your parents are great.&nbsp; They keep you in touch with them and at the same time, they allow you to grow and have fun in life and&nbsp;with friends.&nbsp; Your mind is great.&nbsp; But that doesn't mean become egotistical it just means that I admire how you are able to achieve your goals.&nbsp; (I am using like and admire as if they are the same.&nbsp;)&nbsp; I also think people feel you bring structure to their life.&nbsp;&nbsp; And without&nbsp;you, &nbsp;they'd be lost.   &nbsp;

      ok well i know im crazy... and once i say something a couple of days later i could mean something completely different. But i dont think you should publicly attack josh... b/c he is not a public person. as&nbsp; long as i have known him he is neutral about everything and doesnt care about things that dont have an absolute importance to him. so in your words kev... keep this stuff to ims and telephone calls. i am interested in how this thing turns out with u two.. b/c i care about u both.. but i dont think this is how josh will respond to it well... and i know you know that as well.

       I've known you since 2nd grade.&nbsp; My first years with you I met a person who people enjoyed hanging around, was good at math, learned easily, didn't cause problems, teachers loved, responsible, and a friend.&nbsp; I was happy.&nbsp; I would say you and Pote led the way for us boys.&nbsp; Moving on to junior high... nothing changed but you are definitely a step ahead of me.&nbsp; I would say you could quit high school now and live a life with the woman you want and also be able to lend your brain to some special place that could use it.&nbsp; You won't though because you don't quit.&nbsp; You don't think so but you have an image.&nbsp; You're the sporty nerd jock who people love and you only go out of your way to do things when the girl asks you to.&nbsp; But if the girl asks you to and your family needs you, you'll help your family.&nbsp; Admirable.&nbsp; I became aware of your fanatical love for Purdue in junior high.&nbsp; I also began to gossip about a friend in junior high because you were gettin around with the girls pretty good.&nbsp; You don't think you were.&nbsp; You just think you were doing what people wanted.&nbsp; Oh, I forgot you are good at sports.&nbsp; Without your skills, you know you'd be lost.&nbsp; With your skills, you were able to become liked by the people outside of our ring of friends.&nbsp; All of this...your smarts, your sports skills, your knowledge of sports, your people skills.&nbsp; This all leads us to high school.&nbsp; Nothing new here but you definitely turned around.&nbsp; I would've expected you to be more involved with sports.&nbsp;&nbsp; You join academic teams with friends.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing wrong with that so do I.&nbsp;&nbsp; You also chose to do the musical not because you particularly wanted to but just because someone wanted you to and you knew people would like you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sophomore year came... I think we probably were closer now than when we first met.&nbsp; I definitely have you to thank for surviving chemistry.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Let's discuss you at this moment:&nbsp; I still remember what you said in the cabin at Younglife camp.&nbsp; You said something like you had&nbsp; felt a darkness growing between you and God and coming to camp you hoped you could make the darkness smaller.&nbsp;&nbsp; You were happy for Spencer and I because we now had joined a family.&nbsp; God is an important part of your life.&nbsp; He's in your music, your head, your home, and without Him you'd be lost.&nbsp; God, your family, school, friends, --- and down to whatever you do in your spare time.&nbsp; This is what your life is.&nbsp; It's a pretty good life and you definitely are headed in the right direction.&nbsp; I wouldn't ask you to change it ever.

      It was brought to my attention that when we got back from YoungLife camp, you weren't happy with me at all.&nbsp; You found my personality to be different.&nbsp; You found the way I was acting to be different.&nbsp; You thought I was crazy.&nbsp; You weren't happy that I invited Demi without you knowing.&nbsp; You became extremely frustrated when I attacked you and your family on the night I tried to get you to go see Spider Man 2 with me.&nbsp; You became concerned that I was watching the Daily Show and actually agreeing with some of things the show said.&nbsp; To add onto that, you thought that to be strange because you think the show is funny but doesn't reflect things that are actually happening.&nbsp; You don't like my admiration for Michael Moore.&nbsp; You wonder why I attack Bush because he's our president and we should respect him.&nbsp;   I didn't get this information from anyone.&nbsp; I figured it out.&nbsp; If any of this isn't true, please tell me.&nbsp; But I think I've covered everything that might have caused your irritation with me.&nbsp;

      I've chosen this place to settle a problem that I became aware of by chance.&nbsp; I've had an issue with someone for a few weeks and at Cedar Point, you wouldn't know there was anything wrong...but I still feel like making sure everything is settled.&nbsp; Nothing will be held back and in fact, it will involve some very big issues that you might not want to care about.&nbsp; Right now, I don't plan on forcing anyone to go with what I say.&nbsp; I just want to&nbsp;end&nbsp;a grudge by understanding this person a little better and maybe having this person understand me a little better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This won't be a quick thing.&nbsp; In order to do this right,&nbsp; I won't throw all my thoughts into one posting, or even let it all out in one day.&nbsp; I am guessing this will go on for about four to five days at least.&nbsp; This person is someone who without, my life would be drastically different.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And if anyone knows me, I don't lose friends.&nbsp; I make them.

      Every summer, PETA--the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals--picks two vegetarians and names them the sexiest of all the people on Earth who don't eat meat. Andre 3000 and Alicia Silverstone were chosen this year from more than 180 celebrities after some 12,000 votes were cast.&nbsp; The 2004 winners narrowly edged out a host of other veggie Valentinos and Venuses, including Noah Wyle, Pamela Anderson, Charlotte Ross, Kim Basinger, Moby, and previous winners Tobey Maguire, Josh Hartnett, Lauren Bush, Natalie Portman, and Shania Twain.&nbsp;   There's nothing wrong with being a vegetarian.&nbsp; But I can't deny that it's surprising when you hear about people being one.&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; I just thing it's silly to say humans can't eat meat because of animal rights.&nbsp; I agree with the part about not wearing animal fur though&nbsp;(especially when the heads are still attached).

      I'm watching outside the lines on ESPN right now.&nbsp; They're airing a really interesting story about the Nashville Sounds - a AAA team affiliated with the Pittsburgh Pirates.&nbsp; Apparantly, 7 times this season, they are having something called "Faith Night" at the ballpark.&nbsp; Faith Night includes bobble head give aways featuring Moses, testimonials from Sounds players, as well as performances from Christian bands.&nbsp; All of the ongoings aren't actually on the field, but on the concourse outside the stadium.&nbsp; This, obviously has generated a great deal of controversy, especially since attendance nearly doubles on Faith Nights.&nbsp; The Sounds admit that it's a good business move, but also think it's good for fans.&nbsp; I have a real problem with these faith nights.&nbsp; Religion shouldn't be about making money.&nbsp; Now, I understand that they are helping people, but usually minor league teams are a part of the community.&nbsp; The Silver Hawks are.&nbsp; If the team wanted to sponsor a faith night and not associate it with a game, I think that would be awesome.&nbsp; But making money and giving away caricatures of Moses?&nbsp; Faith isn't the only thing on their mind.

      OLYMPICS   We all know the Olympics are coming up in Athens...which we are all looking forward to because that's where they started, but I have found out some interesting facts about some things people are having controversy over...   When the Olympics were started there was very little "technology" used in it.&nbsp; I don't mean high tech score boards or computers or things, I mean the application of "developing" better equipment to improve time and performance.&nbsp; When the Olympics go back to Athens the athletes will be using some of the latest technologically advanced equipment ever used, and some people don't like the idea.  Swimming, for example, has adopted the use of very smooth, fast, breathable, and "waterdynamic" clothing over the past few years that was never even thought of in the first olympics.&nbsp; This, however, is raising question&nbsp;(*very little however*) as to whether or not the athletes should compete in Athens&nbsp;the "old fashioned way."&nbsp; Obviously this will never happen,&nbsp;and not that many people care about it, but I&nbsp;just thought it was interesting that people actually&nbsp;wanted&nbsp;our athletes to compete the old fashioned way because we were doing it in the origin of the&nbsp;olympics.  Well...thats my story for today...look for us soon as more "exciting" stories develop I'm Josh Hall....wishing you a nice day!

      Because of what I, Robot did, I want to predict that Halle Berry's film CatWoman will make a considerable amount of money.&nbsp; But she's got something else going for her that I am not sure Will Smith has.&nbsp; Will Smith (while possibly being good looking for some) isn't notable for his appearance like Halle Berry.&nbsp; Halle Berry's got everything.&nbsp; And wearing a leathersuit while kicking ass is sexy.&nbsp; There's no doubt that people will want to see her do her stuff.&nbsp; I am guessing this movie could be a turkey (This is a term for a movie that really is awful when it comes out like Gigli.&nbsp; Movies like these make little to no money.) and still be hot cause of Halle Berry.&nbsp; By the way, Halle Berry is keeping her CatWoman suit for the next man she becomes attracted to.&nbsp; I wonder what lucky man will get to enjoy a night with CatWoman.&nbsp; I can only imagine how awesome it could be.

       I took a look at I, Robot preview and thought, "Wow! This is hokey."&nbsp; It's just it's interesting but I felt like it was missing the element that movies like Minority Report and Paycheck have.&nbsp; Right now, I question my idea that this movie could be so bad.&nbsp; It opened and made 52.3 million beating out his (what I think are better movies) films like Independence Day (50.2 mil.), Men In Black (51.1 mil), and Men In Black 2 (52.1 mil). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For any sci-fi movie, you have to be able to buy into it.&nbsp; But with an actor like Will Smith leading the way,&nbsp;you can almost count&nbsp;on people loving it.&nbsp; I was&nbsp;watching Never Before Scene on MTV.&nbsp; The crowd loved what we was doing in I, Robot and truthfully, I think I&nbsp;have changed my mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;At some point, I want to see Will Smith's new film.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (Note: This does not excuse Waterworld from being one of the worst science fiction films of all time.)

      Let's work something out for the next time everyone will be home.  Between Ambur, Josh H, and Paige, it'd be nice to figure out when all three of them can do something next.  This is hard to do and I understand.  But I've been told that I suck at planning.  Well, maybe but I also don't have your schedules right in front of me.  I think instead of pointing out what I do wrong, point out that I am always trying to make things work no matter what.  Like Ambur, we've gone to see movies late for you many times.  So, Ambur, Josh Hall, Paige plus everyone else...look ahead so we can plan a time to just meet and hang out.

      Every now and then I am reminded of just how lucky I am to know everyone here.&nbsp; I stood in line for Millennium Force and between the times I was having fun, I noticed the people standing around.&nbsp; I saw the guy with the hat turned to the side who was pimping two fine looking girls who were wearing Old Navy clothing and&nbsp;also had&nbsp;lip piercings.&nbsp; I saw human body art that made several people look like freakin murals.&nbsp; I saw tight-assed people who stood bored and out of it just waiting to get on the ride NOW.&nbsp; And then, I turn to my group and we were dancing, talking, and messing around in line.&nbsp; Now, I don't want to ruin what was fun by raising it up, but I wasn't bored in line because I was with people who kept it interesting.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       OK...I'm gonna tell you this RIGHT NOW...I love their updates....but the other thing, I'M JUST THINKING OUT LOUD BUT NEED TO BE HEARD, don't bother reading it if you don't want to learn something about me.    &nbsp;  I got home today and all I thought about was spending tomorrow with you guys...well that went down the drain about as fast as the worth on a brand new car being driven out of the lot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Got online, conducted my meeting for Voices of MHS, then came here.&nbsp; I don't think I've laughed that hard in soo long, it was great!, then I came to reading a couple of your profile things.&nbsp; Learned a lot, a lot of stuff I stepped back and said, whoa, definately could have used that information when I said  THAT .&nbsp; Anyway, enjoyed learning about my friends.&nbsp; Then, as I can only explain it this way, had an out of body experience in which I believe I totally just flipped out.&nbsp; The below is where I need the poor soul who decided to read this to come in.    &nbsp;  I'm gonna say something that I hope the person that this is about won't get mad at, but someone came to me saying that they didn't feel like they fit in somewhere.&nbsp; I, being just this type of person that MANY of you don't know of yet, did my best to talk them through it and I think I made it ok again, but just tonight I think something horrible snapped.&nbsp; " I FINALLY FIT IN ."&nbsp; I finally have people who care about me, who listen to me, trust me, like hanging with me, lol...and ITS GREAT!, but OMG   I wasted   it.&nbsp; My God I wasted it.&nbsp; ALL of you are going to come to realize this year that I'm NOTHING like what you thought.&nbsp; And it sucks because I've now wasted almost 4 years just by  TRYING  to fit in by NOT being myself when I already did the few times that I  WAS  myself.&nbsp; Honestly.&nbsp; I don't know, I think I need something like Paige's journal thing instead of this to write in, but this is a start I guess.&nbsp; I'm gonna go ahead and come right on out and say  EVERYTHING  I have to say just so that I feel better, just remember, I warned you.&nbsp; (This will be short from now on)   -I'm funny, really, nobody knows it, but I am...   -I'm patient, nobody has seen it but I am...   -I LOVE LISTENING TO PEOPLE...nobody has taken advantage of it (Kevin and Spenc have)...but I do   -I'm not as hyper and dumb as I played it off to be, thats what sucks...   -I'm not as flippen mushy gushy as I have acted in the last few days....I was lost...REALLY LOST    -to keep it short...I'm nothing like I thought&nbsp;I was...or you thought i was, and now I have all that time to try to make up with all of you, girls and guys included.&nbsp; LOL...IT JUST SUCKS!&nbsp; LOL...WOW.&nbsp; Whether Paige reads this or not, but Paige is right, Life sucks, but it only sucks as much as you make it.&nbsp; I don't know..maybe I'll screw it up this year by being me and you guys finding out you like me faking my horrendous pitiful life better, but I don't care...I feel SO much better now.&nbsp; I honestly think that I will have so much a better time this year then my whole life.&nbsp; You can hold me to it....  &nbsp;

      I am happy that most people tried to post a survey on themselves.&nbsp; I want to say again that those are really cool.&nbsp; Spencer, your story brings an extra stench to the blog that somehow makes people keep coming back for more.&nbsp; Feel free to find more stories like that.&nbsp; Josh, how's the dogsitting?&nbsp; Paige, hang in there.&nbsp; Life gets better.&nbsp; At least that's what I was told to believe.&nbsp; Ambur, Spencer and I are okay now and we didn't have to solve it through the blog.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Cause then other people could get involved and it's just not needed.&nbsp; And I have to say stuff like IM me so that he knows I possibly feel this isn't the place to argue.&nbsp; That atmosphere is better except for the methane emissions coming from Ryan's Steakhouse.&nbsp; (note to self:&nbsp; don't say methane emissions on this website ever again)&nbsp; Okay, still waiting for that chance for us to all get together.&nbsp; It's a sort of taboo.&nbsp; We need to work it out.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Recall that when that event occurred, I was already halfway to sitting anyway and had actually reached the point of no return. I have always considered myself as relatively stable gravitationally, but when you get beyond a certain point, you're going down no matter how limber you may be. Needless to say, the shit wave, though of considerable force, was not so sufficient so as to completely glance off the toilet seat and deposit itself on the walls - unlike what you would see when hitting a puddle with a high-pressure water hose; even though you throw water at the puddle, the puddle gets moved and no water is left to re-form a puddle. There was a significant amount of shit remaining on about one-third of the seat rim which I had now just collapsed upon.&nbsp; Now, back to the vomit... While all the shitting was going on, the vomit was still on its way up. By the time I had actually collapsed on the toilet, my mouth had filled up with a goodly portion of the macaroni and beef I had just consumed. OK, so what does the human body instinctively do when vomiting? One bends over. So I bent over. I was still sitting on the toilet, though. Therefore, bending over resulted in me placing my head above my now slightly-opened legs, positioned in between my knees and waist. Also directly above my pants which were now pulled down to a point just midway between my knees and my ankles. Oh, did I mention that I was wearing not just pants, but sweatpants with elastic on the ankles. In one mighty push, some three pounds of macaroni and beef, two or three Cokes, and a couple of Big, Fat Yeast Rolls were deposited in my pants...on the inside...with no ready exit at the bottom down by my feet.

      blah blah blah boring warning...   ....I was about halfway into "The Move" when I looked down at the floor and saw a pile of vomit that had been previously expelled by one of those little bastards attending kids night. It was mounded up in the corner so I did not notice it when I had first walked into the stall. Normally, I would not have been bothered by such a thing, but I had eaten so much and the pressure upward was so intense, that I hit a rarely experienced gag reflex. And once that reflex started, combined with the intense pressure upward caused by the bloated stomach, four plates of macaroni and beef started coming up for a rematch. What happened next was so quick that the exact sequence of events is a bit fuzzy, but I will try to reconstruct them as best I can. In that moment of impending projectile vomiting, my attention was diverted from the goings-on at the other end. To put a freeze frame on the situation, I was half crouched down to the toilet, pants pulled down to my knees, with a load of vomit coming up my esophagus. Now, most of you know that vomiting takes precedence over shit no matter what is about to come slamming out of your ass. It is apparently an evolutionary thing since shitting will not kill you, but vomiting takes a presence of mind to accomplish so that you do not aspirate any food into the bronchial tubes and perhaps choke to death. My attention was thus diverted. At that very split second, my ass exploded in what can only be described as a wake...you know, as in a newspaper headline along the lines of "30,000 Killed In Wake of Typhoon Fifi" or something similar. In what seemed to be most suitably measured in cubic feet, an enormous plug of shit the consistency of thick mud with embedded pockets of greasy liquid came flying out of my ass. But remember, I was only halfway down on the toilet at that moment. The shit wave was of such force, and of just such an angle in relation to the back curve of the toilet seat, that it ricocheted off the back of the seat and slammed into the wall - at an angle of incidence equal to the angle at which it initially hit the toilet seat. Then I sat down.

      I love posting these so let's all post dumbass quotes.  I'll put two up there for pure entertainment.  They are old but that doesn't matter.  Larry King: "What do people misunderstand about you most"   George Walker Bush: "That I'm running on my dad's name... (!?!)  I'm proud of my dad... I reconciled my love for my dad a long time ago"   -- What the heck is he talking about? (2000)  Bush: "First of all, Cinco de Mayo is not the independence day. That's dieciséis de Septiembre, and ..."  Matthews: "What's that in English?"   Bush: "Fifteenth of September."  (Dieciséis de Septiembre = Sept. 16)   — Hardball, MSNBC, May 31, 2000

      The usual disclaimer applies...   ...By the time I had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical portions.  I began "The Move."  For those women who may be reading this, let me take a moment to explain "The Move." Men know exactly what their bowels are up to at any given second. And when the time comes to empty the cache, a sequence of physiological events occur that can not be stopped under any circumstances. There is a move men make that involves simultaneously approaching the toilet, beginning the body turn to position ones ass toward said toilet, hooking ones fingers into ones waistline, and pulling down the pants while beginning the squat at the same time. It is a very fluid motion that, when performed properly, results in the flawless expulsion of shit at the exact same second that one’s ass is properly placed on the toilet seat. Done properly, it even assures that the choad is properly inserted into the front rim of the toilet in the event that the piss stream lets loose at the same time; it is truly a picture of coordination rivaling that of a skilled ballet dancer....

      Okay...I was just trying to see if I could find some cool blogs like ours out in the blog community. I happened across someone whose favorite movies are The American President, All the President's Men, and Ass Worship 1-5. It's not Dick Cheney. Nope, he has his lesbian daughter for that. Check this out though because it is a good reminder of what not to do. This site really has some of the most disturbing material ever.   capitolx.blogspot.com

      I was happy last night to be able to talk to Josh Hall. And then I was disappointed to see that he was leaving, but it's all well and good and he'll be back Monday. I've been trying so hard to get people together just one time. Emailing...calling...talking to them on the internet.... Just I want to hang around with everyone. But I am having some troubles because I don't know what all of you are up to or if you really want to get together in the first place. So... if possible, it'd be nice if people start posting like each week, what their week is gonna be like. Do it on a Monday. And anything you know about that would keep you from going somewhere can show up here in the Cafe. It'd make doing stuff real easy. Izzy's comin home. You all know that and she'll be joining up. Anyways, later.   Note: Today's not Monday so if you want to post what's happening from now to the weekend that's cool!!> ;-)

      I should mention this story isn't depiciting an event that I'VE expericenced.  It's told in first person, but that's just because of the author who wrote it.  !WARNING! The following story is based off of actual events. While hilarious, it may contain content that may be unsettling to some readers. If you you a weak stomach, you may want to pass on this story. If you, however, enjoy a great deal of hilarity, then this story is definitely for you. I would encourage all reader to at least ATTEMPT to read this story. Don't say I didn't tell ya...   ...At first I thought it was only gas, which could have been passed in batches right at the table without too much concern.  Unfortunately, that was not to be. After a minute or so it was clear that I was dealing with explosive diarrhea. It's amazing how grease can make its way through your intestines far faster than the food which spawned the grease to begin with, but I digress... I got up from the table and made my way to the bathroom. Upon entering, I saw two sinks immediately inside the door, two urinals just to the right of the sinks, and two toilet stalls against the back wall. One of them was a handicapped bathroom. Now, normally I would have gone to the handicapped stall since I like to stretch out a bit when I take a good shit. But in this case, the door lock was broken and the only thing I hate worse than my wife telling me to stop cutting my toenails with a pair of diagonal wire-cutters is having someone walk in on me while I am taking a shit.  I went to the normal stall. In retrospect, I probably should have gone to the large, handicapped stall even though the door would not lock because that bit of time lost in making the stall switch proved to be a bit too long under the circumstances. By the time I had walked into the regular stall, the pressure on my ass was reaching Biblical portions...

      I'm starting early...  !WARNING!  The following story is based off of actual events.  While hilarious, it may contain content that may be unsettling to some readers.  If you you a weak stomach, you may want to pass on this story.  If you, however, enjoy a great deal of hilarity, then this story is definitely for you.  I would encourage all reader to at least ATTEMPT to read this story.  Don't say I didn't tell ya...  Funniest damn thing that has ever happened to me. A couple of weeks ago we decided to cruise out to Ryan's Steakhouse for dinner. It was a Wednesday night which means that macaroni and beef was on the hot bar, indeed the only night of the week that it is served. Wednesday night is also kid's night at Ryan's, complete with Dizzy the Clown wandering from table to table entertaining the little bastards. It may seem that the events about to be told have little connection to those two circumstances, but all will be clear in a moment. We went through the line and placed our orders for the all-you-can-eat hot bar then sat down as far away from the front of the restaurant as possible in order to keep the density of kids down a bit. Then I started my move to the hot bar. Plate after plate of macaroni and beef were consumed that evening, I tell you - in all, four heaping plates of the pseudo-Italian ambrosia were shoved into my belly. I was sated. Perhaps a bit too much, however. I had not really been feeling well all day, what with a bit of gas and such. By the time I had eaten four overwhelmed plates of food, I was in real trouble. There was so much pressure on my diaphragm that I was having trouble breathing. At the same time, the downward pressure was building. At first I thought it was only gas, which could have been passed in batches right at the table without too much concern.

      I'm faced with a tough decision this evening.  On ESPN, the second installment of "The 2004 World Series of Poker" is being aired.  At the same time, Major League Baseball's All-Star Game is being aired (the Cubs have 3 reps...Double S, Big Z n MO!!).  Now usually it'd be an easy solution - tape one.  Unfortunately the only VCR I can use to tape stuff isn't operating correctly.  So I'm forced to decide.  Which one, poker which I'm like obsessed with, or MLB's best game of the year until October.  This is rough.

      Hi all...the title should say everything.  I weant back through these posts...I AM WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY OFF.  I don't even know what to say..i'm sitting here thinking of what the heck to say and I don't know what to....other than that i blew up.  Just read the below for me...please...don't take offense to it...just read it and try to let it soak in, just please...please don't let this get in the way again ok?  We're all WAY too close for us to be broken off like Preston.  Screw him..ok...he went his own way because he couldn't tollerate "talking" to us.  Got a beef, talk to the person.  Arguments and fights are ok...we'll get over them and patch everything up.  I'm just trying to find myself...I found it while camping..showed it to JR.  I need to show it to all of you.  I'm gonna fill out one of these profiles things that kev and Paige did and see what I found out and what i can show you.  I do have a sense of humor..really...but its hard to find what to say to make everything ok in a funny way.  Thanks guys!

      HEY...I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY THAT I FEEL EVERYONE WILL GREATLY ENJOY READING. I WOULD LIKE TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT OUR LIVES HAVE OFFICIALLY BECOME A SOAP OPERA.  THIS ONE DOESN'T LIKE THIS ONE, THIS ONE DOESN'T LIKE WHAT THIS ONE IS DOING . MAYBE THIS ISN'T SOUNDING THE BEST COMING FROM ME...BUT MY GOD IN MY EYES, AT THIS MOMENT, WE'RE ALL LOOKING LIKE LITTLE KIDS WHO CAN'T  RESPECTFULLY  WORK OUT OUR PROBLEMS.  ALL OF US NEED TO FRICKEN WAKE UP AND SEE THAT NOT EVERY FAMILY IS THE SAME . I, for an example, do not have the gracious freedom many of you have. No...not all of you have a TON of freedom...but majority of you have a whole lot more than me. Josh R's family is very family oriented and traditional...don't like it...then deal with it. He was raised that way, can't change it, and lives with it. If you ask if he can do something and he can't because he's spending time with his family don't screw him for it. ONCE AGAIN, NOT EVERY FAMILY IS THE SAME, READY TO DO ANYTHING WITHIN 30 MINUTES, DROP EVERYTHING FOR THEIR KID AND LET THEM DO WHAT THEY WANT. Some live structured lives, some don't. If it sounds like I'm a bit mad...you're right...I am. Everyone...and I do mean EVERYONE at one point has had something to say because of someone else not being able to do something or not doing it the same way as someone else. ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BE A BIT MORE UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER. IF WE HAVE A PROBLEM...TALK TO EACHOTHER. MAYBE YOU DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHATS GOING ON BEHIND THE SCENES. THATS ALL I ASK OF YOU...  ASK  .   Hope you all enjoy reading this and getting mad at each other for it...but I tell you this...before you go opening your lovely mouth...try thinking about what I said first....

      I have good news.  I have recently reaquired the funniest story ever.  Now, it's rather lengthy, so I'm gonna release it in parts.  Right now, I have it split up into 8 parts, so I'll probably release two parts per day.  I must warn you while this story is funny, it will come with a disclaimer.  You'll understand immediately why.  I'll start sending it out tomorrow.

      I went on vacation once and I was with my family and some of my closer relatives.  My uncle, aunt, two cousins, my brother, my dad, my mom, and I...we were all sharing the same place.  We had a boat to go out on a lake.  We had a beach area to enjoy.  We had sunshine and we had so many places to just relax that anyone would have loved it.  But I got a little too into myself, and I started to forget how great things really were.  My brother did something to irritate me and I made a scene.  At the expense of my family, I stopped people dead in their tracks and started insulting my brother.  And I thought I was so right that people who got irritated at me were just as bad as my brother.  One thing I learned from that is my problem was foolish but better...I could've told my brother in private and not ruined all the fun people were having.  Spencer...you got a problem IM me.  This is something you don't need to involve others in.  New Beginning??? Let's ROCK!

      Ok so I went to sleep at 4:00 last night.  My fault, my fault.  No one to blame for that.  Not much on TV.  Reruns of the home run derby and Sportscenter till like 3.  Then that's pretty much it.  Some pretty good infomercials.  I asking for the Turbo Cooker for Christmas, and the set of steak knives.  I just wanna be able to say "hey I cut up this dinner with my steak knives and cooked it in the Turbo Cooker."  That'd be cool.  Anyway so went to sleep at 4.  It's 5:30 my mom comes busting in.  5:30.  That's 90 mins of sleep.  "Help, we need help outside."  I need help sleeping mom, but w/e.  Apparently my dad's car stalled or something on the way to work in the middle of the street.  So we had to push it to the curb.  That was cool.  I didn't have any shoes on.  Fun stuff.  SO I have to go to drum lessons today right? Well I was gonna drive out there with my FRESHLY ACQUIRED DRIVER'S LICENSE.  Opps, my dad's takin my car to work.  Smooth.  Nothing better than having a license for like 4 days and not being able to drive right away.  grrrrrr. ok so came back in from pushing, went to sleep.  Got up this morning for a haircut.  9:00 for that.  so, that's like less than 5 hrs. of sleep. Spencer's takin a nap later!!!  But, while I've been home, I've had some free time.  Nick Slauson sparked my curiosity.  Yesterday he almost fit in his dryer.  So0o0o I decided to run my own test.  I tried both ovens (upstairs and downstairs).  Upstairs is A LOT closer to fitting me in, but I was afraid I was gonna break something.  I tried the dryer.  Yeah that's no good either, I'd have to be like sucking on my knee or something.  I tried the washer.  THAT'S A BIG NO.  That just wasn't a smart decision on my part.  So basically I can't fit anywhere in my house.  I can fit in the truck of my car tho!!! :) (I tried that a long time ago).  Yeah so that's about it thus far.  Sorta an interesting day to start off with...and it's not even 11!

      Look Kevin I'm really tired of your egotistical remarks on here.  Ok you founded the place yes it's a good site, yes it's a good place to be, thanks for always reminding us.  But when you say stuff about "So why am I STUCK with ppl...", yeah well I'm gonna say something.  Your mission statement at the beginning..."anything and everything will be said"? well actually it should be "anything and everything will be said, as long as Kevin's ok with it.  What about "Arguments are fine until they become unruly"?  It's a simple argument.  Kev people are gonna complain about stuff no matter what.  It's just gonna happen, but come on man.  You can't tell ppl what to say and what not to say - that sorta defeats the whole purpose doesn't it?  This is the 193rd post...n you're gonna tell me that two comments bring down the whole site?  Gimme a break.  If ppl wanna complain, then hey I guess they can.  I've NEVER complained about the site.  Did I say that if ppl are gonna complain they should do something about it?  Yes, but I didn't actually say you know this place sucks.  It's a good place.  And I think that it's good if ppl can say whatever they want.  If it's extremely derogatory, then yeah it's bad, but thus far I don't see anything that's too bad.

       I loved watching the Apprentice.  And I think all of us should follow it when the second season hits NBC this fall.  I came across this article.  Looks like a bunch of redneck tow-truck drivers wanted a piece of booty or something... Check it out.   Last week, Apprentice star Katrina Campins and her fiancé were jumped by a team of tow-truck drivers, who left her with a broken nose, scrapes and bruises.   On Thursday, the alleged perps, Donald Seay, 27, and his brother, Daniel Seay, 24, were arrested and charged with two felony counts each of aggravated battery, per a North Miami Beach Police Department spokesperson.   The men are scheduled to appear in court for a bond hearing this afternoon.   The "Apprentice" star, Katrina Campins, a Miami-area realtor, and her beau, Ben Moss, were planning their September nuptials at Donald Trump's Miami hotel on June 27, when they saw their car being towed from a strip-mall parking lot.   The high-school sweethearts confronted Donald Seay but he refused to release the vehicle and reportedly cursed them out. (Still no word from officials on why the car was towed.)   The reality star and Moss proceeded to follow Seay in a cab to the towing company's lot where they allegedly scuffled with the brothers and several unidentified men.   "[We] were knocked to the floor. I was punched and kicked in the face, back and neck," Campins said in a statement.   But according to an interview Daniel Seay gave local TV station WPLG, the lovebirds sparked the smackdown.   "They came in my office. He [Moss] was ranting and raving about [the towing, saying] he's not paying for this," said Seay. "He hit me in the back of the head. I turn around, [and] he's still swinging at me. So I defended myself. I ended up hitting him. He fell over her, and they both went to the ground."   Following the fracas, the couple fled to the Parkway Regional Medical Center, where Campins was treated for a "broken nose and lacerations on her head, neck and torso" and Moss was treated for a "split upper lip and lacerations on his scalp, neck and torso."   Authorities say they don't anticipate filing charges against Campins and Moss. A lawyer for the couple says a civil suit has already been filed against Seay Towing.   Strange....Tow truck people are scary.  No one stands in the way of that thing.

      The new way to make it look like you weren't ridiculous for allowing people to film you in a celebrity porn video just might be to donate all the money you make to charity.  Paris Hilton's decided in order to settle her sex-tape scandal with kinky costar Rick Salomon she'll give her share of the money  to charity.  She just wants to make the situation positive.  According to the New York Daily News, Hilton stands to earn about $400,000 plus a percentage of the sales from One Night in Paris, a 45-minute tribute to the platinum princess, who's shown having sex with Salomon and engaging in other more PG-rated activities. (Nothing with Paris is PG rated but anyways)  The big plus of donating money is that the two stars wouldn't have to sue each other for money anymore.    So getting down and dirty could be a new way to help support people.  Just grab a camera, do your stuff, and put it on the web.  Pick a charity like AIDS Foundation or American Heart Association maybe the Red Cross could use it.  Oh, and helps if people think you're incredibly sexy.  I think this sleazy shit is retarded.  Anyone can see this isn't about a hot porn video.  We're only hearing about it cause Paris is fighting with her costar *SLUT*

      Alright, if you didn't catch this last night you all should watch it tonight on E! (ch. 50) from 8 to 11.   The Real World, Saved by the Bell,  Baywatch, and Friends are just a few of the shows that started.  Hot stars like Pamela Anderson and George Clooney (ER) showed up on TV.  And the Spice Girls were making music and MC Hammer was dancing in his special funky pants.  Who misses the 90s?  I do.  Watch on E! tonight.

      You know one thing this journal site does is it brings everything I know in the world into my home.  I have you all.  I have news.  I get to always be reminded of movies.  I'm constantly thinking what can I do for these people.  And then it hits... Suddenly people aren't satisfied.  Well, I just showed this site to a friend before the idea of making it better came through.  She said that she thought it was cool.  But I am just sick of all the comments where it sounds like people are trying to start something.    Like for the Thoughts on Indecision Pt. 2 ...  At 12:18 PM, Spencer said...  Sorry we're inadequate.  At 5:12 PM, Barbie said...  I'm glad to know that you feel that you are STUCK with us, i didn't know you felt that way...   Go back and read.  You'll see that I wasn't attacking anyone.  I want to remove your comments from the site because they ruin the atmosphere that I would like to have.  Here's an idea:  Post a response.  Tell me exactly why it makes you uncomfortable rather than making up some dumb comment.  This is going to sound hypocritical.  I'm known to be sarcastic.  But I think I'm really trying hard to just be open minded and consider what everyone has to say and not stunt it with some stupid sarcastic remark and that should be something everyone all tries.  Quit thinking I am attacking you personally.  I won't and I have no intention of knocking some of my closest friends down.

       Sup Y'all?!   OMG Guys!!!  You have written WAY too much for me to read here at 12:45 a.m.  while sitting here on Anchor Dr....My GOSH its good to be home.   YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH I HAVE MISSED YOU ALL ! I don't think there was a single day I wasn't thinking of at least one of you like "MY GOD I WISH I HAD SOMEONE TO TALK TO THAT DIDN'T ASK 'HOW Y'ALL DOIN' THIS FINE NIGHT?'"  I must admit...Paige...I thought of you the most because of the book.  Maybe I'm just weird...but I kept wondering what you were thinking while reading it...like i said...beats me.   Anyway...I'm only here for a VERY short while again...like until Wendesday.  I'm then leaving again until Monday at which point I SHOULD be here for the rest of the summer.   WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING .  This in itself leads me into something completely and totally different that nobody wants to read cuz it will take toooooo long.  Anyway... SOMEBODY  please contact me and we'll try to get together.  I got a call on my cell phone while in TN from the Main Office requesting a time that I would be back because they need my "final say" on the network...I wanted to tell them to shove it up their as*es and hire somebody who knew what they were doing...but I said I would stop by for like 5 minutes tomorrow...other than that I'm free to "hang".  GOD its good to be home.  I've got sooo much more to write, but for the love of you people...I'll stop.  I'll maybe explain more later, but I  HAVE  to get this out:  I think I have seriously changed.  I don't for some reason feel like I don't 'KNOW MYSELF' anymore.  I think a lot of you will be pleasantly surprised at my new found confidence and "spunk."  Once again...can't go into detail here.     OOOOOO---BTW:  WELCOME DAVID!!!   CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU GUYS!!!!-Josh

      I agree with spencer that this place needs a change! maybe not some drastic, omg-everything-here-is-wrong change, but it needs to be different.  I dont have a problem reading about the political stuff, but i dont comment on it because it doesnt interest me. I dont even mind the sports stuff, even tho half the time i dont understand it. There are things that i expected out of this that i'm not getting. But now i realize that it's up to  me  and not kevin or spencer or josh. if I'm not reading things that i'm interested in, i can't blame them. they dont know what i want. only i do.  that's how you all should be. if you have a problem with what you're reading..or aren't reading, as the case may be...do something about it! it's like the whole voting thing..if you dont like how Bush is running the country, speak up and be an advocate for Kerry. Or whatever. just do something about it.

      I can't hide my feelings on life.  There are some things that I just feel people should know.  One thing happened today that bothers me and I just want to issue a friendly reminder to people.  If you say you're gonna do something, you should go through with it.  And after you carry it out, you shouldn't go back on what you've done.  For instance, if you're against gay marriage that's alright.  But once you allow gay ppl to marry you can't take away their marriage.  If you don't know, about 4,000 people's marriages were taken away.  These people's lives have just changed dramatically for the worse.  All because a simple gift was taken away from them.    People think a "mistake" was fixed but you can't do this to people.  If it's a "mistake" then don't let it happen again

      (Great Nirvana tune) I guess I didn't expect people to want to see me at PSI.  Well I did, but I decided to not go because I am having teeth pulled out on Tuesday and will be missing three days of band and I won't be marching in the game (at least right now I am not expecting to be feeling up to it).  So I thought it was important that I go even if I didn't want to.  OF COURSE I did think today how much more fun it would've been to be at Riley.  Oh well, I hope to see everyone at my house tommorow night. Sorry I didn't show up Ambur and see ya later.

      If I'd known today was going to be so much fun, I'd said "okay fine".  But really? This wasn't just the first day of band camp.  Andy, Spencer, and I now have a great story to share that involves rain, storming, driving, McDonalds, baseball game, etc.  I won't tell it here because it'd be fun to talk about Friday when we all get together for a party to welcome Andy back home.  Hope you think about this and plan to come Friday.

      Would you all like to know how incredibly tiring and ridiculous band camp is?  I want to go there and not complain and have an okay time, but it happens.  They come up with crap like "by the numbers".  Yes let me explain: You know how you have a tempo?  You know how you have a rhythm to marching steps?  Well, for some reason they decided to break unbelievably easy moves down into parts.  A left haste that can be done in 1 second becomes a 1 minute move.  Each time you hear the number you do the part of the move, and they hold you on that part until everything is just right.  And everyone laughs their ass off cause this is ridiculous.  Not to mention, the munchkins from Wizard of Oz have become are drum majors (no offense to david, sienna, or jessica jackson but you can't see them like you could see bryant).  David has one problem too that needs to be fixed or else the band is going to end up marching off without him.  He calls a halt and nobody can hear him so the entire band misses it.  Whoo! What a mess?  And Hartman yelling her ass off at trumpets.  Let's find a plus to all this:  Andy's back and on top of that, there were other ppl from the band I saw who I enjoyed seeing again.  Joe Lidecker wore a shirt that said I Love Lesbians.  Besides all the hassle and ridiculous stuff we do, band can be fun.

      BLACKSVILLE, West Virginia (AP) -- A man smoking in a portable toilet lit up more than a cigarette.  The potty exploded Tuesday when a buildup of methane gas mixed with the lit cigarette, said a spokeswoman for Monongalia Emergency Medical Services.   The methane didn't "take too kindly" to the lit cigarette, she said.  Emergency workers said the man was not severely injured and drove himself to the hospital after the stinky, smoky mess.  This incident helped him understand one thing...   ... Cigarettes and portable toilets don't mix

      Today I was out shopping.  This was the fun part of my day because later I went to see an oral surgeon.  He told me all about the fun I'll be having when three teeth are pulled.  Can't pull all four.  One might get infected.  We set a date, Aug 17th.  My summer is going to end a week earlier.  I'll be full of pain and insane.  I'll get to take it easy in band unfortunately.  I'm sorta happy about that.  It'll be kinda weird not marching in the first game, but that's what will happen.  Here comes another big plan of mine.  ONE WEEK IN ADVANCE... Friday 13th (ooh spooky!) or Sat 14th.  I want to make sure we do something but FIRST, let me know that you are free and interested.  Then we can all work out something to do before I get my teeth pulled.    Oh I watched Secret Window and Open Range...Both good movies but watch Open Range when you have lots of time...Watch Secret Window cause Johnny Depp is great.

      I dunno whether or not anyone will read this, because I'm not sure too many ppl still visit here regularly, but I had to post this.  It's like 15 till 12 right now.  and like 30 mins ago I started dusting my room.  Like all of it.  Everything.  Not just part of it, like all of it.  Behind stuff, under stuff, everywhere.  I dunno why.  I was lookin at the computer desk and I was like man this is dusty.  Well, it's not dusty any more!!  The dresser is still a lil dusty...I'll have to finish that up 2morrow or something. I just wanted to share my dusting experience today.  And I also wanna figure out what kind of font this is.  Because it's different when you post something than when you type it.  I don't like the font it is when you post stuff.  I like this one though.  Gotta figure it out.

      I wanted to just write about stuff I've been doing.  So that's what I am gonna do.  Let me start with the little stuff.  I saw some movies and so let me tell you about them.  Watched The Big Bounce.  It's cool, but not much happens in the movie (i liked the girl in the movie tho).  Watched Barbershop 2.  Good movie.  I like the first one more though and I think the world did too.  I went with my brother and dad and saw Anchorman again.  I think I laughed more than the first time.  That movie is great!  Alright...enough of that I got some new music that I discovered through CDNOW.com and my downloading software.  Downloaded some Taking Back Sunday and Yellowcard (Believe, Way Away, October Nights).  It's good.  I also downloaded some rap stuff.  Kanye West, Petey Pablo, Jay Z (99 problems is awesome), and of course Nelly's at the top.  Can't wait for that day in the future when he releases his two CDs on the same day.  His song My Place with Jaheim is good.    Care to know what I've been up to?  I went to McDonald's with friends last night.  Kinda disappointed Paige didn't join us but that's cool.  I ate at some pretty cool places over the weekend.  Went to Edwardsburg to see my grandpa and ate at Lunker's.  Last Friday, I ate at Grand Empire.  Six or seven plates of food...awesome buffet!    I can't help but thinking that I had a great summer but I could've done more.  I don't want it to be over and I am sure everyone else feels the same.  But I think some good things will be happening soon so I won't worry about it too much.  I don't know how everyone else feels but if people are still reading what I wrote, then I want you to consider getting together either a week from this weekend or two weeks from this weekend.  I'd have no problem hosting it.  Just I need to hear from people.  Later
