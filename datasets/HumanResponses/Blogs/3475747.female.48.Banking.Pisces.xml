						   Well, beat me over the head with the stupid stick.  Men are worthless at leadership.  Time for the women of the world to rise up and put men back in their natural place: beneath us.    http://www.adn.com/business/story/5132900p-5061428c.html  In addition, Cook Inlet has additional natural gas available on a seasonal basis from the Agrium fertilizer plant. The fertilizer plant and the Conoco Phillips-Marathon LNG plant, both at Nikiski on the Kenai Peninsula, are Cook Inlet's two large industrial gas users. Vandorn said the fertilizer plant provides "production backstop" to natural gas deliveries in Southcentral. In the winter, when natural gas demands for home heating and power generation peak, gas going to the Agrium plant can be curtailed. Because of declining gas supplies, however, Agrium has said it may be forced to close the plant.

						   May 27, 2004: first national press:  Porter noted the state was exploring the use of tax-exempt agencies that can help the project, including the Alaska Natural Gas Development Authority, a group that has been active for about a year, Porter said.  http://www.reuters.com/financeNewsArticle.jhtml?type=bondsNews&storyID=5278623  Unfortunately, I am in competition with the Republican Sex Blogger - but I respect Lynddie England's service more.  Give that woman a promotion and a medal.

						   Gee, Kerry thinks LNG is a good thing and specifically mentions it in his Energy Plan.    Kerry said he supports importing natural gas by ship in a condensed form known as liquefied natural gas (LNG). "We must work to find technology applications that make LNG more readily available and protect surrounding communities from unnecessary risks. This source of potential new natural gas supply presents challenges -- both as to source, since it must be imported, and its required infrastructure. If done properly, however, LNG can be part of a balanced energy portfolio for the United States' energy future," he said.  http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/040604/dcf004_1.html  You go Jessica.

						   Gawd, these boys are priceless, absolutely priceless - not allowing a sitting Mayor and former State Legislator to testify in a public hearing paid for with citizen taxpayers because it would "DISCOMFORT" the three Big Oil Companies?  ARE YOU SERIOUS? shove off boys, worthless drunken bunch of cowardly males running America:   urlLink http://www.news-miner.com/Stories/0,1413,113~7244~2304417,00.html   In a blistering July 27 open letter, Whitaker accused Sen. Scott Ogan, R-Palmer, of requiring he preview Whitaker's testimony about a natural gas pipeline because it might "discomfort" the three major companies that pump Alaska's oil. Whitaker ultimately wasn't allowed to testify.  Are my fellow Americans really this stupid and duped by MEN?

"We have ANGDA. The people said they want a gas pipeline," when they voted to create the authority, Griffith said. "Let's make it happen." The gas authority is studying the possibility of a gas pipeline built to a liquefied natural gas plant in a community on the state's southern coast. The authority is also working on preliminary engineering and cost estimates of a spur pipeline from a large-diameter gas pipeline to Southcentral Alaska.  roflmao - you boys figuring this out yet?

						   Pensacola News-Journal on electronic touch-screen voting machines: The flap in Florida over the security of electronic touch-screen voting systems descended into farce last week. While Gov. Jeb Bush was touting the safety and reliability of the systems, the Republican Party of Florida was warning voters to beware of them. The governor wasn't pleased, and party officials apologized. But Bush should have listened to them... Critics of the machines say they don't like the fact there is no paper record of a voter's ballot, as there is with scanning systems that read paper ballots marked by voters. That makes recounts — a touchy subject in Florida — suspect. Defenders of the system say they can provide a paper printout. But without an actual paper ballot filled out by a voter, critics remain suspicious that elections can be rigged electronically, and there would be no way to tell. For example, if the electronic tally was tainted, wouldn't the printout also be? Jeb Bush has emerged as a strong defender of the electronic systems, calling them reliable, and has been taking heat for refusing to allow an independent audit of their performance. The state has also promulgated a rule prohibiting manual recounts on the systems. ... Then came news reports that the Republican Party was sending out fliers — complete with a picture of a smiling President Bush — warning about the lack of paper ballots in electronic systems, and urging voters to use absentee ballots. The flier said that "The liberal Democrats have already begun their attacks and the new electronic voting machines do not have a paper ballot to verify your vote in case of a recount. Make sure your vote counts, order your absentee ballot today." The apology from the state Republican Party tried to paper over (no pun intended) the flier's obvious message that the lack of paper ballots is worrisome. "The recent absentee request flier in no way is meant to shake the confidence of voters in Florida's electoral process," said a spokesman for the state Republican Party. "We regret that the language contained in the absentee ballot request was unclear in this regard

						   you go Ogan boy, muzzling an elected official in America over Big Oil, unreal:   urlLink http://www.adn.com/opinion/   Sen. Scott Ogan both exceeds and betrays his authority in muzzling Fairbanks North Star Borough Mayor (and former state Rep.) Jim Whitaker. Who does Sen. Ogan think he's working for?  As chair of the Senate Resources Committee, Sen. Ogan first demanded to screen testimony that Mayor Whitaker intended to give at a hearing last week and then barred him from testifying.  Why? Sen. Ogan was worried that Mayor Whitaker would get too worked up, that his demeanor would not be appropriate and that Mayor Whitaker's testimony might cause the state's major oil producers "discomfort."  No kidding. According to Mayor Whitaker, Sen. Ogan actually told him in a phone call that previous public criticism of the major producers -- British Petroleum, Exxon Mobil and Conoco Phillips -- "had the producers' panties in a wad," and he, Sen. Ogan, did not want his hearing to "get out of control." Ergo, the advance review and then banishment.  GEE FOLKS, COULD THIS BE BECAUSE WHITTAKER SUPPORTS OUR PROJECT OVER THE BIG OIL/BUSH'S TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS AMERICAN TAX GIVEAWAY PROJECT THROUGH CANADA?  Are Americans really this duped by MEN?
