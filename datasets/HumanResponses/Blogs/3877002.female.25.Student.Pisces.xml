      Because I finally got a chance to wear my adorable new grass green slicker from  urlLink  Urbn.com  .   Good Good Weekend - all the important things were covered - a little bit of politics, a whole lotta dancing and libations, and some mad manicure and pedicure action.   Watched a show on the Travel Channel about new things to do in Vegas so we are now making plans to go to  urlLink  Ice  , the hottest and coldest bar on the Strip. I know, I know, at this point you're wondering - How can a club be both hot AND cold?  Well, my friends, I'm going to be honest - I don't really get it either.  But it has something to do with liquid nitrogen and a temperature drop of about 30 degrees.  Just don't tell my parents where we're going as I'm sure they'd be concerned that the sudden change in temperature will cause us all to catch cold.   My mom has already begun bombarding me with her now infamous "Don't set your drink down" (DSYDD) speech. Since I was a pretty thoughtful teenager I think I may have actually listened to her had she not prefaced "DSYDD" speech numero uno with "Last week on 'Walker Texas Ranger', there was this girl at a club with a drink..."  Sorry mom, but any kind of behavioral lessons usually go unheeded once you bring Chuck Norris into the fold.   I had a whole slew of links I wanted to direct people to but for some reason "Walker Texas Ranger" has distracted my very fragile attention span. Ah wait, I think they're coming back.  Further proof that I am the original celeb trendsetter continues to develop.  First, on a recent shopping trip I referred to myself as "the Paris Hilton of Target."  Now, a new Target just opened in Brooklyn to a  urlLink  celeb-studded party   featuring a certain friend of mine's fave indie girl, Maggie Gyllenhaal.    Next, what is up with all the celebrity break-up chaos?  First it was me and a certain Yellow Rat Bastard and now it's  urlLink  Kirsten & Jake   and  urlLink  Paris & Nick  ...who will be next???  A couple of side items that make me giggle a wee bit.   First of all, I just have to say that even though the New York Post is not exactly a safehouse of accurate journalism, I still think they are a really fun read.   Maybe they are having so many problems this summer because the majority of their staff is in the Hamptons writing up the Hamptons Diary and this other column which could basically double for the barhopping adventures of any city, but since it's in the Hamptons is somehow supposed to matter.  Today's  urlLink  article   is about a dude who sold his shirt for a $100 to gain access to a crowded hot spot.   Finally,in honor of my weekend of double entendres and XXX-rated Mad Libs, click  urlLink here   to see a really classy headline from Reuters News Service about MTV network's new gay channel, Logo.

      In an effort to atone for the less than positive attitude I've been having lately, I just want to take some time to list some of the things that have made me smile in the past few days  &nbsp;  My thanks and gratitude go out to......    Hilary Duff for making a movie so bad that Rolling Stone called it "upchucky"    The scheduling department at "On Air with Ryan Seacrest" for booking Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, and Warren G. on the same day as Richard Simmons   The meter maid for giving me the standard $15 parking ticket rather than the $55 citation that I usually get   The Director of Catering at the Renaissance Hotel for being just late enough for our 1:00 lunch appointment that I spotted Jeff Goldblum in the lobby   The Starbucks barista in Cleveland who gave me a free&nbsp;extra shot in my Iced Grande Skim No Whip White Chocolate Mocha   Barnes and Noble for always having an empty seat by the window   Bravo for showing a " urlLink Blow Out " marathon every Sunday afternoon   All my fabulous friends who are all just as screwed up as I am but consistently take time out of their busy schedules to validate and console&nbsp;me

      Hm, I've been trying to post something for the past two days but it seems like I only get the initiative to blog when I need to be doing a million other things - like reading Mrs. Dalloway for Lit class or writing a four page essay on symbolism in WWI poetry.   I really don't want my blog to be a catalog of my pet peeves but it's been one of those days. And my top annoying item of the day would have to be people getting angry for no good reason. For instance, there is a guy in my class who gets almost personally offended anytime our professor lectures on formatting our papers according to MLA format.  I certainly understand it's boring but why all the sighing, moaning, and shuffling of books?  In my opinion, people should really reserve that kind of righteous indignation for things that are truly wrong - like  urlLink Lindsay Lohan   getting a recording deal,  urlLink Joan & Melissa Rivers defecting from E! to the TV Guide channel  , and Jessica Simpson's mom in the recent issue of  urlLink Vanity Fair  claiming that Jessica's IQ is "like,160. And, you know, that's like a genius level."   Ah, so much celebrity bashing to do, so little time.    Okay well since I kind of disparaged Miss Lohan, I guess my props for today will go out to Hilary.   (I'm very bipolar when it comes to my adoration of teen celebrities.....)

      Just when I thought that hard news was dead and The Daily Show was the last bastion of journalistic integrity, CNN restored my faith in the media with their in-depth, hard-hitting article on the issue that everybody has been worrying about -  urlLink  How will Frat boys vote ?   Notes from the typing pool.....  Days away from my promotion (or so I hope) from the wacky world that is Administrative Assistance, a brief journey on the web revealed that secretaries don't just inspire stereotypes - they also inspire art! Just check out this  urlLink  clip  from a writer for the  urlLink Conan O'Brien show .  One would think that a promotion on the horizon would actually make me WANT to work but instead I've been spending even more time than usual on-line, fearful that a REAL job with REAL work involved will mean much less time spent catching up with Page Six and La Dolce Musto.      Hilary or Lindsay?    Mm, I was thinking it might be Hilary - she does have that new movie coming out next week about Cinderella and what not. And I have to give her a few extra points for the fact that her sister was in Napoleon Dynamite. But when I saw her on Jay Leno the other night she wasn't very funny and made a couple too many jokes about Jay being "old."  Sorry Miss Duff, but I'm just not feeling the old fart jokes from a sixteen-year old. Today's props go to Lindsay!

      Unless you've been living under the proverbial rock that may or may not be da Burgh, you're well aware that there is a new radio station in town.   93.7, formerly WBZZ which was formerly B-94, is now 93.7 K-Rock, official Pittsburgh home of the Howard Stern show.   Now for those of you that are pro-Stern as I am, you will have already set your alarm clock to the channel, anxiously anticipating the morning you'll once again awake to Howard, Artie, & Robin.  Right now, K-Rock is in the process of defining their playlist which would explain why the past four mornings I've been awakened by the Cure, Led Zeppelin, and Billy Squier among other eclectic and highly annoying acts.   For those of you all about the rock, I strongly recommend visiting the following site and answering the 200+ survey that will help the station tailor their format to listener requests.  My friend Amy and I just filled it out a mere five minutes ago, our only comment was a three line plea for Tenacious D & the White Stripes.   Ok, enough about me -  urlLink Take the freakin' survey!

      Is it just where I happen to work or do UPS deliverymen in general tend to roam about in gangs? Every day from about Noon to 2:00pm, five local UPS men form an impressive posse outside the building where I work.  Normally they stick to the group of benches along Fifth Avenue, but lately I've noticed them moving about freely - a vision of brown in matching shoes, shorts, shirts, and hats.  Yesterday I saw them at the newstand fraternizing with one of the Airborne Express deliverymen.   Mr. Airborne looked slightly intimidated by all the "brown." He mostly kept to the periphery of the group, looking over the shoulder of his faded gray shirt as they headed up the hill. Along the way, another man in a ketchup stained Wendy's shirt joined them. Might the "Uniforms" be planning to mount a take-over?  Or do I just have too much free time on my hands during my lunch hour?

      Just wondering why people do any of the following things:   Send drunken text messages   Tell me what I should write about or how I should manage my career. If I hear one more person at work tell me how they once began writing a romance novel or that I should start sending love stories into Redbook, I will seriously scream.    Tell me to smile.   Unless they are complimenting my shoes, I really wish random men on the street would never utter any of the following phrases - "You'd be real pretty if you cracked a smile" or "Hey honey, it ain't that bad."  Well, for once I'd like to tell them that yes honey, sometimes it is that bad.

      Despite what celebrities may lead you to believe, breaking-up isn't all S&M photo shoots, press releases to US Weekly and concentrating on your musical reunion with the Backstreet Boys.   For the peons like myself, this breaking-up stuff is hard work. Sure, I may look like I'm living it up with my new Chanel sunglasses and plane tickets to Vegas but I'm empty on the inside. Empty like the money pocket in a certain Gucci wallet that I happen to own. I've been very open with the possibility of selling my wallet on E-bay.  So open that one of my co-workers brought in a digital camera today. Now, armed with real photos that can be uploaded onto e-bay in a mere matter of minutes, I'm faced with the very real possibility that I will finally begin purging myself of Yellow Rat Bastard (YRB) for good.   In theory it sounds like a great idea. YRB had no problem letting go of me, so why am I having such trouble getting rid of a wallet?  I've already emptied it out and put it back into its original box, but still its tugging at my heart.   And even though I had the option of leaving it at home today, I still dragged it with me in my already heavy purse. When you're involved in a long-distance relationship, there are certain things that you do to help you feel closer to your significant other. For me, it was never just a wallet - it was a symbol of our relationship.  A symbol of the fact that for once in my life somebody actually thought I was so special that I deserved my very own $400 designer wallet.  I guess to some people it wouldn't seem very important, but to somebody like me who grew up thinking that happy meals & Barbie clothes were outrageously expensive and the JC-Penney's Christmas catalog was the height of luxury, the idea of owning a $400 dollar wallet was one thought I'd never even entertained. As I think about the wallet now, YRB inevitably turns back into OREB (Overly-Romanticized Ex-Boyfriend).   OREB was so thoughtful.   He told me that I deserved that wallet.  That I shouldn't settle for anything less.  And now I look at it like it's some kind of cruel joke, a bitter reminder that maybe he was lying all along.  Oddly enough we ended up talking about the wallet during what would become one of our last conversations. I was telling him an anecdote about my afternoon and how I had dumped the contents of my purse onto the floor at a computer store when I was unable to find my car keys.   There at the feet of three kind Russian men, I tried not to cry as I fumbled through my belongings looking for the keys that I would later find in my back pocket.  As I searched through the crumpled Kleenexes, tattered bus schedules and receipts, unopened bills, sticky bottles of lotion, broken tubes of lipstick, pens, pencils, and a hodge-podge of candy wrappers I thought about one of the first lessons I'd learned in my Fiction classes this year - that the best way to reveal a character is through minor details such as the contents of their cupboards, cars, and even purses.   I thought about the fact that I carried this heavy bag with me everyday but now that I was seeing what it contained it all seemed so foolish. Everything was basically garbage, nothing of note, nothing to set me apart.  The only thing it seemed to say was that I was too lazy to clean, completely frazzled and disorganized, but somehow or another had landed a beautiful wallet that looked out of place beside all the clutter in my life.  Now I worry if I give away that wallet, what will I be left with? Will I be proud of the strength it will take to finally move forward and let go of OREB?  Or will I be letting go of the one thing in my life that really meant something just to make a few quick bucks?   So now I pose this question to all of you my friends(yes, all three of you) - when it comes to the wallet, Should it stay or should it go?
