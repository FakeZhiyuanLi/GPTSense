        ONce AgiAn I'M BAck     I launch this blog today because I have no time to edit and many things I want say , I am really F*** up by my juniors today .... They will get it from me , 1 day they will let me screw upside down ...And I promise ... Secondly NDP , the drills of both the NCC and the NPCC GOH sucks like hell include me , I cannot believe it ! , worse than SHIT .... Thirdly , bloody hell ...... Don't know what to say really stuck in a turmoil , I want to get out of it ! becasue of xuan zhu , I dont know should i give up and go focus on my studies , taekwondo and NPCC or should i also include her in my goals ????..... then now somebody is trying to go near her , I cannot stand it anymore , i do not want to get affected by her but i just cannot let it go , i swear to myself i will never give up , i can break the promise that i made to other people but i AT LEAST must keep my own PROMISE .... but then i also cannot force someone to like me , she said i dont know her well , fine , but when i want to know her she run away from me , fine , this made me feel like i am a monster , i stopped talking to her after the BBQ , only ocassionaly on msn , basically i feel abit awkward and becasue i am busy and also N levels , i foce myself not to think about her instead it grew the opposite way , this is more powerful than a drug , what is worse , this few days SOMEBODY trying to do something to impress her which i heard and see enough .... man i dont want to complain i dont want to think i just feel like i need a break or should i just leave it to fate maybe it is better ... what is mine will be mine ,waht is not mine will not be mine

       Heart Broken As Usual      I do not know what to do now , i can either forget her or chase her now becasue there is some back stabber around me , i just want to let time pass so that i can make a decision... should i not give up and start chasing or just leave it to fate but this will give me a insercurity and fate is in our hand i thought ?.. i think i am going to take a risk and give her a chance and also give myself a chance for what i think is the best even though i love her so much , i hope i have made a correct decision , 16 should be fun but not sadness and sorrow , i rather die happily rather than die with such problems

        NDP 2004    The parade was very fast , end in a blink of an eye ,sianz .... then go return rifle because of that cannot join the finale ...sad ....      I really want some  wang qing sui ....i have seriously thought about it ... is to really let her go .... i cannot carry on anymore .... no matter what i do will not touch her heart and she will never be happy , i hope she is happy and not angry or dislike me because of my behaviour.... sometimes something really need to let go ... if it is yours it will come back if not it will go away forever ,i think there is someone out there interested in her , if that guy ever treat her badly or bully her , prepare for a knock out , now i must concentrate more on my study rather than her becasue N levels is just less than a month , now is the best time to study becasue of national day holidays , i MUSt WORK to be the 1st in Na standard , yesterday i watch a show if i am not wrong its name is True Courage .... it is about a guy who is very successful , he got a rank , career , a wonderful girlfriend and a happy family .... just one night after he had supper with his girlfriend , he rode his bike on the express way , he thought there was no other cars around becasue it was quite late , with high speed he never noticed a road block and he crash into a railing or car or some sort , and flew many many Meters away with his bike broken into half , even his helmet is spinning on the ground , his face was really disfigured and he had a very bad head injury , he gone through several surgery until one day he woke up from his COMA and forgotten everyone that he knew and he was just like a 3 year old kid .... this is not the part that i really want to mention , it is after he was discharge , at home he look really like a 3 year old kid , becasue of his medical fees his father cannot go through a heart surgey and died ... i was really sad when i saw that .... but he inspired me to work harder and believe nothing is impossible because he decided to end his life by comitting suicide but he just cannot do it becasue his neighbour who was also paralyse during a car accident made him realise that he could do something rather than sitting around doing nothing but complaining and want to die ....so he changed , he threw away all his clothes , broken up with his wonderful girlfriend and began to study , waht did he study ? , he went to university to study about human brain , to find answer on how to regain his memory , what inspired me most is that he had a very bad memory eversince but he can study very hard to get the degree he wanted and so now he live a normal life but now he also help people who suffer from his same fate to regain confidence and to treat their problems ...      after i saw this program , i really believe that with determination , nothing is impossible ,he can turn from a hero to zero in just one accident but he took many many years just to stand up and excel again , i really wanted to salute him and shake his hand to celebrate his success with him ... i believe if i can also have this determination in me i believe that nothing is impossible , at least i can learn from him , i never met any accident and i have a very healthy body , i really want to thank him , he gave me confidence to stand up and face my failures again , my life for this year is not a very good one , do anything there wil be failures such as geting very low for tests , having realtionship problems , from GOHC to GOH , as long i do anything fail anything but i believe this is going to end now ! ? why ? because from today onwards , i will never be the same again , I want to be a high ranking officer , i want to be a national fighter , i want to go university , i want to find a good wife ,all this is not a dream but my goals that can turn into reality....no matter how hard this road is going to be even it is hell i will go though it and be a better man !i want to put down all my burdens and walk towards this new direction that i set for myself ....

        Chance ~    Erm ... today chinese lesson , teacher told us something about chinese is not included for university admission , she read to us an article about opposing this decision , it is a story ..... about a singaporean in other country who do not know his mother languague when he was ask to write in his own languague of "how are you" on the board he told the lecturer saying that his 1st languague is english and the lecturer told him to sit down and also said that english is my languague and it is not yours ... the rest of the japanese , italians , koreans , etc etc .. stared at him all of them could write the words in their own languague but not him ... if i were that singporean i have lost my pride and dignity ... then teacher showed us an animation mtv ... the song is about chance ... it was a rather touching mtv eventhough i think i was among 10% who are serious in the class,the rest were just joking and playing a fool ...they said it was a propaganda but what i think is that it is a fact ... if we are chinese we should know our own languague , history and culture ....and now we still have chance we should cherish it and not waste this precious 1 and only chance ... i can understand how teacher feel but my own fundamentals are weak ,how am i suppose to score A1s in my own mother tongue when i still have the rest of the subjects as well ? .... i felt sorry for her and guilty though ... but it is not that some have given up it is the basics that we lack and weak in ...if only i can master my basics again i would have been in the express class ... or even higher mother tongue in primary school ... it is just less than 10 days to chinese prelim.... i know it is niave to think that i can score 1 in just 7 to 6 days but i only know that miracles could happen and i still have chance and i should cherish it , every tiny weeny little bit of chance , at least i tried my best and never give up , i should not let her down ....      Hopefully my determination will reach to the max this week ... i am starting to get back my confidence and my determination is growing stronger day by day ... i have stop thinking of her but more on my studies and expectation , everytime i see her i will get distracted especially with him around .... i will always tell myself "Nelson you can do it , you will be the best , you are the best , you will not rest,dont give up , many people are expecting you to be the best ,you can do it you can do it , dont give up dont give up etc etc" i will keep on repeating this phrases in my mind until i am totally focus and determine ,hope this can work ,at least it did help me a little to forget about her ...but truthfully i still like her but what is more important is my studies and future ... i cannot ruin my future just like this ... for some things 1 chances is given ONLY and this chances ,once you lose it you cannot get it back anymore so NOW i cannot lose this chance of getting my ass to sec 5 to poly and to university , I cannot let my mother ,brother ,sister , miss tan tm , miss soh , miss koh , miss tan lm , mr tan and all those teachers who have thought us down , i really cannot disappoint them ... they put in effort to teach us i will put in effort to show them results ... all of them gave me a high expectation i will return them my high stnadards !!! NElson CAN DO IT !!! NELSON WILL NOT GIVE UP !!!! ~~~~ !!!
