      Heloo  This is what happens to me when I'm bored: I do stupid things to waste my time. For example, I write insignificant things to pass the time.   I'm bored. That's B-O-R-E-D. i'm bored because you're boring. Hahaha. Nah just kidding.  Uhh, if there's someone out there who's very very familiar with this bloggy thing, drop me a few tips to personalize my blog ok?  Ok... i think I'm gonna dance to some music, although my legs are killing me. (Just got back from cycling with my monkeys.)  God, i'm bored. Cant wait till school starts. Bring on the good, bad and ugly people. Bring on the boring lecturers. Anything to make life... busier. I wish Teacher Rapiah would call me up to ask me to do some maths sums. Haha.   Signing out~~ Peace & Take Care

      I dont like being rushed. Why do people rush me? I still complete my responsibilities. I still do what I have to do. Why rush me?  Sigh... Ive got an anger management problem, and I know it.  I dont like people telling me not to be angry, that it's not nice to be angry, that anger can destroy me. Because I have the right to my anger, everybody gets angry once in a while, and my anger actually builds me.   I think clearer when I'm angry. My mind works when I'm angry.  I tend to change my sadness or dissapoinments or whatever, to anger, because i can THINK straight.   Is that wrong? Is that so bad?  When I'm angry, i tend to say things I'm not supposed to say. Things that i want to say, but for the good of everyone, cant say. My mouth just shoots them off, when I'm angry.  There's a quote: It is a good rule in life never to apologize. The right sort of people do not want apologies, and the wrong sort take a mean advantage of them.  I disagree a bit. (what's new? i disagree with almost everything hehe) I think people should apologize, if they believe they're wrong. Some people say sorry, and dont mean it. Why say it?  One thing I do know, is that when someones sorry, really sorry, and apologize, they got my salute. Afterall, it takes someone big to stand up and say they're wrong. Right?

      Salaamz...  Hmmm. I'm hoping right now. This kind of hope is so small, it gets under my skin. Very ironic, how the big things, big problems I can handle myself and get through them, but when it comes to the small things, I get nervous.  Like the United vs Millwall FA Cup Final match. It's so silly. "Not the end of the world," a friend said. Well, true. And yet... I cant figure out why. So idiotic of me...  Aniway. I went to school today, to fecth my monkeys. On the way, in the bus, I saw a group of Maarifians, taking pictures, about say 6,7 of them, at the busstop. In front of Tanjong Katong Complex. The first thought was, "What the... No other place to take photo isit??" But then i laughed to myself... Cause it brought back so many memories...  I have lots of memories of school. Those were the days. I got into trouble, played around, fooled around, caught in a few tricks, got away with some. And all the things that I have done, i cannot sincerely say that I regret them. Everyday at school, is a lesson. Not just educational, but moral lessons, life lessons.  There's a saying that goes: A school is a building of four walls and tomorrow inside. For me, it rings true, because not only does my school provide me with the necessities on Earth, but also in the Hereafter, and I can't be thankful enough...  School, Ma'arif, is also the place where i found my Friends. I hold on to the idea that there are 5 types of Friends: Just~, Good~, Close~, True~ and False~. I found all five in Ma'arif.  My sister once asked, where would i want to go, if I werent already in Maarif, and it brought a smile to my face, because my mind went blank. I dont know, truthfully. My heart is so binded with Maarif that other Madrasahs are never an option for me. I never dreamt of being in another madrasah, and never will.   I am a Maarifian, through and through.  How funny, considering that just five months ago, my decision not to stay at Maarif is because Im tired of it.  Well. So proves the sayings: "So ironic how I had to lose just to see." "You don't know what you've got till it's gone." "You don't miss the water till the well runs dry..."  Peace  PS/ To the present Maarifians out there: Savour every moment you're there, be thankful for everyday... Take my word for it :)

      Haiz...  Somedays, I wish I were the type of person who can break my word.  But I can't, because I'm not like that.  I take people seriously, because people are no joke. I take people's word seriously, because words are no joke.  You know the saying, sticks and stones break bones. Words can shatter the soul.  I gave someone my word, and I broke it a couple of days ago. So to make ammends, I apologize, because I am truly sorry, and I hope it would be enough... And again I gave my word.  I wish I hadn't. It's hard when you take people seriously. Harder when you take yourself seriously.  I guess i take myself toooo seriously. I wish I can break my word. I wish i go behind people's back and stab them. I really do.  But Trust is something that I hold close. I will never ever voluntarily break my word.   Take my word for it.
