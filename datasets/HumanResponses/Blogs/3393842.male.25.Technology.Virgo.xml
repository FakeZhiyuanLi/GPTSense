       Folks, got any pointers to keeping the start page of  the blog small ? Like they do in  urlLink OK/Cancel . I dont want the visitor to have to stand the entire  length of ... ..well whatever they think of my posts,  if they dont want to. Just a small summary and then  a  urlLink Read More>>  link and they get to read the whole post, else they just read the rest of the blog.  One  urlLink Prof  drilled into my mind that any site if it doesnt catch the fancy in the first  twenty seconds, it has flopped.  What I am basically trying to do is not cause a bad  day of mine resulting in a bad post result in a bad  opinion about my poll.   Any pointers ?  urlLink Six Foot Two  are you there ?

       I had a tough time deciding on the title for this post. 'Cos to pick a punch line from  urlLink The Matrix  is like  finding ONE favorite among all the favorites, rather an unjust thing to do to all the other punch lines that didnt get chosen.  Anyways, this post is primarily to introduce a link to Don Davis'  urlLink site . Scroll down there and you find all the upanishads, their translations that were quoted in the movie.

       /*  * One of the most interesting things in life is having a   * discussion with peers on hot topics. If the peer group   * is a fun group, then any topic gets  * the hot topic status. You never know. Talk about consciousness,   * classical music, design flaws on everyday stuff the TV remote,   * the list is endless...  *  * Discussions have taken various skins, there is this 'awe'   * skinned discussion where the group talks about, the beauty   * of Thamarai's lyrics in his/her recent song. There is no denying  * no arguments, just each one's version of why it appeals.  *   * Then there is 'combat' skinned discussions. Each one trying   * to prove a point across. Well this post is about these two   * types of discussions.   *  * Now, to the 'combat' skinned, What is each one trying to do ?  *  * Its like standing on two ends of the spectrum trying to make   * the other 'understand' the 'situation'. The highlight is, the   * discussion is among peers, if one of them considers the other   * a fool, there is no scope for discussion, there could be some  * argument but when one argues with a fool, people may not be   * able to tell... So its among people who dont think the other   * is a fool, its a "Let's find out what he thinks about this   * idea of mine" attitude. If the other doesnt agree, Is one in   * a position to take it ?  *   * If the other doesnt agree, or is simply on a parrallel   * plane of consciousness which won't meet , what is the state of   * the communication now ? Has it broken down ? Psychological   * maturity allows subsequent communication (read more such   * discussions), the lack of it gives scope for a better sense   * of judgement about oneself, the level of tolerance to alternative   * perspectives one can handle.   *  * All this in a flawlessly initiated communication among peers.  *  * Now introduce a flaw in the premise, that the communication had   * a seemingly small bug, that the initial topic simply didnt reach   * the other side, but the points used to substantiate it did.   * In other words the core of the discussion missed, but the   * discussion grew on the examples or illustrations or whatever tool   * was used to communicate the core idea. What is the state of the   * communication now ?   *  * The discussion has lost focus on the core but is now focussing   * on the illustrations. The flaw I am talking about is this, the   * illustrations the more interesting they are, the more easily the   * topic gets deviated. The human brain probably lacks the tools to  * arrive at THE ILLUSTRATION for a thought or feeling.  *  * How do I keep the underlying core idea undisturbed by an   * attractive illustration ?  *  * Engineering freaks might come up with a feedback cycle, a constant   * check on progress made in getting the idea across.. na kills   * the fun in the communication, but does it get the task done ?  *  * Think of other communication tools. Something like a piece   * of paper or a drawing board to illustrate ideas on a serious   * peer chat.  *  * Phew.. all this for a harmless chat ?!!  *  * Now to the core idea behind this blog, what if a discussion   * was initiated with an intent of being 'awe' skinned, but turned   * out to be a 'combat' skinned. Does this introduce a strain   * in the relationship ? Is this lack of common ground good on   * a long term ?  *  */     ps: Was sick of this '0 comments', now no-one (..well except blogger.com) can say that there are no comments in this post.

       I dont know if you folks agree with me on these audio woes...    Problem :   Winamp volumes are not indicative of what the user hears. The winamp volumes are more indicative of the factor of increase in amplitude that is multiplied to the source signal than the amplitude of the output.  This can be observed if you have songs with varying input amplitudes in your playlist.  I normally listen to winamp with a mild volume, but this problem requires me to keep adjusting the volume whenever there is a sudden change in input signal amplitude.  Normally when I work I have the audio play at a very low volume, and the kind of music is slow, classical ones, unless I feel like I'd fall asleep.    Problem :   The play list preference I choose at the start of the day isnt as captivating as it starts out to be. Through the day's progress, the playlist doesnt keep up with the mood changes.   I hear fantasy stories about Bill Gates'  urlLink home  .  Not sure if it will still keep up with all the mood changes though. I will have my MP3's tagged with genre, raaga (if applicable), taala, composer, etc.. and this software should come up with a media library of moods. Nothing like it if the software can analyze the signals and arrive at the mood of the song. The software should come up with an optimal mood-route© so that if i start with a monday morning blue the songs in the playlist should get me back on to the most efficient work-mood.    ps: you can forget about the © for now. If you come across such a product already in the market, let me know I'll seriously consider a change of profession

       Music needs a little initiation.  Folks not initiated to english music, MJ, Britney, Bryan Adams, find it yelling, unbearable. Folks not initiated to carnatic or any form of classical music find it boring (and old fashioned and not 'happening' and...) . Just a small matter of familiarity and exposure. Friends in college introduced me to english music with MLTR, BSB, Roxette, Bryan Adams, Savage Garden, Alanis Morisette and that gave myself a rough idea of the kind of music I like and then on get the confidence to choose. Happened to bump into a classical (really old style) guru and am clinging on to him to appreciate the classical art form. I surprize myself by appreciating them too.  Classical music is bound by so many rules. So many rules that you wonder has it got any scope for creativity at all. But when you see a performance, involving atleast 3 accompanyists, its amazing how they synchronize with each other's creativity 'cos unlike western compositions, here they dont have a clearly jotted out 'Notes'. Must listen to Chaurasia to be mesmerized by a vibrating air column. He sets the sound to flow and our minds afloat.  Now, to why music ?  Out of college and into the industry ? Do we get a chance to appreciate things other this browser window ? Other than the chat client ? more interesting things like a nice sunrise ? enjoy the evening rains ? Music is one such experience, all you need is a pair of headphones and a mind which can appreciate. Neither unreachable. And you're out of the routine. And when you can create it, say singing, or playing an instrument, all by yourself... wow. Exciting isnt it. I find many of my colleagues all 22-28 starting out on some instrument. It is not for performance on stage or as a career option, it is to enjoy the learning experience. The thrill to imitate a famous composition, the thrill to create one of one's own which doesnt seem to be a racket any longer... ecstatic.  Disclaimer (before it gets boring): This blog is not to initiate others into music, it is for others who are already initiated into some kind of music to agree and/or argue with my thoughts.      ps: 'Why Technology...' will be posted some other day, you are sufficiently warned !! :)

       Every introduction starts with this simple two letter word. So here is mine. I intend to share a piece of my mind on music, technology, philosophy and general things of interest (pretty much covers the universe doesnt it!! ;) ...).   I intend to keep this blog free from copy-pasted stuff, instead provide links to the sources, am absolutely new to HTML,scripting, et al., and dont hope to learn much. Hope blogger.com lets me continue to share my thoughts inspite of that.  My favorite blog used to be  urlLink Anya's . Yeah used to be cos she's stopped that blog (probably continuing under another nick and blog). Now I restrict to a couple of techie weblogs  urlLink Joel's  and  urlLink KC's .   See ya all blogbudds at the end of the day. Got some serious keyboardhitting and neuronfiring to do.

        urlLink The Learner 's portal kinda post took me to a Mac site which said Mozilla is out with Firefox 0.9.1. I was using 0.9 earlier. Yes was. Downloaded the newer fox browser, the only visible difference I see though is the advanced preferences. Appears to be a GUI version of the .rc stuff you find on the Unixes. If I wanted that on 0.9 I would have typed  about:config  in the address bar. Tools>Options however, provides a tree kinda structure for the same.  Had a look at the  urlLink big picture . Am looking forward to 1.0 though.

         you were saying something about some communication and bandwidth funda in  your blog. I wanna post a comment but could nt find it in their.. so here  is my say. This is a much researched about topic  and  urlLink this  is one of my  favorite links that deals with the matter at a very basic level.  For Advanced level analis of these stuff I would recommend ASIMOVs  Foundation series .A full 5000 pages :) Its a sic fi.

        If what appears regularly on the stage these days is Bharathanatyam, perhaps the practice and craft of the hereditary community of teachers/dancers should be called by another name, "Sadir", one of the older names for Bharathanatyam  -Ms.Indu J Verma   Source:  urlLink Defining Styles : Hindu December 2001    We keep hearing "our culture is dying" stories all the time. I used to think it is one bunch of anachronistic people who dont keep up with time. And our culture is not as old as we think it is. The thought that Bharatanatyam took a proper shape after the Britishers made strong in-roads is shocking news to me. We have very very very little documentation on Pre-British India. Or Pre-British south india rather. Whatever we have there are few who can understand and translate to readable forms. This is the state of documentation, what about performing arts ? It has to be practised with all the traditional values intact, piety, grammar and creativity. The question now is:   Can a culture, an ethos be recreated in a modern setting?  -V.R.Devika    There is going to be a lecture demonstration in Bangalore tomorrow(26/6/2004) at Wilson Garden. If there is anyone interested in bharatanatyam, its tradition,etc.. and residing in bangalore or ready to make a trip at such a short notice for such a cause, here's the address: Attakalari - Center for movement arts No. 24-04, BTS Bus Depot Road (Behind Mandovi Motors Ltd.,) Wilson Garden, Bangalore - 560 027.  I wish I were there tomorrow.

       When Joel said about Web enabling applications ( urlLink 1  and  urlLink 2 )  I thought that's still a utopian wish list. It took me an invitation to  urlLink Gmail  to correct my thought, thanks  urlLink Ajay . In one of my earlier posts I've said Yahoo's 100MB is fine with me. That still holds, cos it could take a long time for me to fill it up (hopefully), my habbit of not retaining forwards would stay on for some more time inspite of the space. I am digressing, back to gmail now. Apart from breaking the mental barriers we had about web based e-mail, this sets the expectations on web apps to come. I did read about the auto contact lookup and stuff, but seeing it work is a different thing altogether.  As of now, Its been close to an hour since I got the account which is too short to give a fair opinion (on all its shortcomings). Buf if the saying "The first impression is the best impression", gmail comes with a bang. Folks, if you've not got it yet, I tell you its going to be worth the switch over.  Ok.. so e-mail is finished what next ?  Music player.. yes that's another application I'd not live without in a PC. If someone could come up with a web based music player, nah.. not the plugin based stuff that we have already, and without the delays seen in streaming multimedia content, it would be another killer app. But the problem with music unlike email is that it does not come under the free speach category. Hmm.. I'd love to stick to  urlLink FireFox  and the web apps if only all the apps I use became experiences like this one just did.

       I find its difficult to sustain the motivation on anything. To do a good job at anything either you need to be more than sufficiently motivated or you need to be disciplined.  Folks of the older ages must have some how realized this and should have worked on these religion stuff. Somebody someday very very very long back should have found it very difficult to keep up the motivation of somebody he had to deal with on a daily basis, probably himself. He/she must have finally decided that discipline works better and that should have been the start of these religion things, or is it civilization .. whatever !!

       If we are to calculate the bandwidth of the communication between two human entities. How would we do it ? Lets involve all possible components, verbal, visual, assumed common sense, everything !!   Do you think the bandwidth would be more when there's an arguement ? Or would that be a situation as in a "high traffic on a low bandwidth" situation.  To make the measurement easier let me define the endpoint. It is from one mind capable of cognition to another. 'Cos there could be a lot of data loss in the carrier, medium losses (misinterpreted words), external noise, the receiver having no free buffer space (pre-occupied mind),... So the item to be measured is the effective bandwidth after all these losses.  How do you think we can measure it ?  Though human communication involves communicating feelings, moods (if they are different), etc.. lets restrict ourselves to 'an idea' or a learning. The measurements should read something like 'N' Quantums of ideas per hour between a mother and her kid.  And how would it be with a guy and girl in love ? I wonder if anything would get transferred at all (I meant 'an idea' or 'a learning') :-)  And how would it be in a business deal ?

       Kudos to whoever manages  urlLink this site   I dont know much about carnatic music, just begun to appreciate it and if there's anyone out there who wants to listen to some examples for Alapana of a particular raga, Neraval, Swarakalpana, that is the place.  I intend to replicate this library locally. I hope they dont mind.  The quality of the recording is bad, but not a hindrance to learn.  This is a vocabulary an  improvement attempt. At times it is necessary to improve vocabulary to communicate with (and get doubts answered from) people who understand the Jargon.

         If we have to put our thoughts in structures what type of  Features you would like to have. ?  - Social Programmer.     urlLink this discussion  had some really interesting ideas, a few samples..    Associations. Look at it this way: Everything is a "concept." Any one concept is associated with any number of other concepts. The "association" itself is a concept. -------------------------------------------------------- example: "music" is a concept. It is associated with concepts such as "enjoyment", "pastime", etc. These are in turn associated to "people" etc. There is no "root concept", they are all intertwined.  -Alex    And there's this..    A thought isn't a data structure. Its an event. Its a message. The message might packetise some kind of data but in effect it generates an event when the message is received.    Interesting :->

         Of his music, Rabindranath Tagore, wrote in a letter written during his first visit to England, " I have not earned it with the sweat of my brow. It is a gift which i shall deserve only if i know how to love it".    Source :  urlLink Indiamusicinfo   There have been days when the room goes boom boom filled with the resonance and there are days when I am filled with uncertainty (is the pitch high/low now?!!). Today morning the moment I saw his face I could sense today was going to be an uncertainity day and it was. There's something about the old school style. There's more than just lessons and getting taught. The mood of the teacher and the mood of the taught is communicated in much subtler ways. It takes hardly 3 minutes on a classroom session to get the feeling that something simply isnt right. There's something emotional that affects the sound.   urlLink SixFeetTwo  do you think this should also be systematic and unrelenting to emotions, more like a computer. Probably computers are not yet complex enough to model the influences of non-verbal or rather non-explicit inputs while doing the already tuff process of learning.

       Has anybody thought about this ?  urlLink     When you have a LCD display in a digital camera, do you still need a viewfinder like conventional cameras ? If at all anyone uses it, they'll land up making nose prints on the LCD display. Why dont camera makers stop copying mistakes ? I do understand a viewfinder is useful in a digital camera when the battery is down and there's some juice left just enough to save pictures and not enough to display them on the LCD. But why dont they come up with a flip up view finder so that, I dont land up making nose/cheek impression on the LCD display.

        Disclaimer  :      What follows could hurt. To me, it did !!     In the summer of 1959. At the Feather River Inn near the town of Blairsden in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of northern California. A resort environment. And I, just out of college, have a job that combines being the night desk clerk in the lodge and helping out with the horse-wrangling at the stables. The owner / manager is Italian-Swiss, with European notions about conditions of employment. He and I do not get along. I think he’s a fascist who wants peasant employees who know their place, and he thinks I’m a good example of how democracy can be carried too far. I’m twenty-two and pretty free with my opinions, and he’s fifty-two and has a few opinions of his own.  One week the employees had been served the same thing for lunch every single day. Two wieners, a mound of sauerkraut, and stale rolls. To compound insult with injury, the cost of the meals was deducted from our check. I was outraged.  On Friday night of that awful week, I was at my desk job around 11:00 P.M., and the night auditor had just come on duty. I went into the kitchen to get a bite to eat and saw notes to the chef to the effect that wieners and sauerkraut are on the employee menu for two more days.  That tears it. I quit! For lack of any better audience, I unloaded on the night auditor, Sigmund Wollman. I declared that I have had it up to here; that I am going to get a plate of wieners and sauerkraut and go and wake up the owner and throw it on him. I am sick and tired of this crap and insulted and nobody is going to make me eat wieners and sauerkraut for a whole week and make me pay for it and who does he think he is anyhow and how can life be sustained on wieners and sauerkraut and this is un-American and I don’t like wieners and sauerkraut enough to eat it for one day for God’s sake and the whole hotel stinks anyhow and the horses are all nags and the guests are all idiots and I’m packing my bags and heading for Montana where they never even heard of wieners and sauerkraut and wouldn’t feed that stuff to pigs. Something like that. I’m still mad about it.  I raved on in this way for twenty minutes, and needn’t repeat it all here. You get the drift. My monologue was delivered at the top of my lungs, punctuated by blows on the front desk with a fly-swatter, the kicking of chairs, and much profanity. A call to arms, freedom, unions, uprisings, and the breaking of chains for the working masses.  As I pitched my fit, Sigmund Wollman, the night auditor, sat quietly on his stool, smoking a cigarette, watching me with sorrowful eyes. Put a bloodhound in a suit and tie and you have Sigmund Wollman. He’s got good reason to look sorrowful. Survivor of Auschwitz. Three years. German Jew. Thin, coughed a lot. He liked being alone at the night job – gave him intellectual space, gave him peace and quiet, and, even more, he could go into the kitchen and have a snack whenever he wanted to – all the wieners and sauerkraut he wanted. To him, a feast. More than that, there’s nobody around at night to tell him what to do. In Auschwitz he dreamed of such a time. The only person he sees at work is me, the night disturber of his dream. Our shifts overlap for an hour. And here I am again. A one-man war party at full cry.  “Fulchum, are you finished?”  “No. Why?”  “Lissen, Fulchum. Lissen me, lissen me. You know what’s wrong with you? It’s not wieners and kraut and it’s not the boss and it’s not the chef and it’s not this job.”  “So what’s wrong with me?”  “Fulchum, you think you know everything, but you don’t know the difference between an inconvenience and a problem. If you break your neck, if you have nothing to eat, if your house is on fire – then you got a problem. Everything else is inconvenience. Life is inconvenient. Life is lumpy.  “Learn to separate the inconveniences from the real problems. You will live longer. And will not annoy people like me so much. Good night.”  In a gesture combining dismissal and blessing, he waved me off to bed.  Seldom in my life have I been hit between the eyes with truth so hard. Years later I heard a Japanese Zen Buddhist priest describe what the moment of enlightenment was like and I knew exactly what he meant. There in that late-night darkness of the Feather River Inn, Sigmund Wollman simultaneously kicked my butt and opened a window in my mind.  For thirty years now, in times of stress and strain, when something has me backed against the wall and I’m ready to do something really stupid with my anger, a sorrowful face appears in my mind and asks: “Fulchum. Problem or inconvenience?”  I think of this as the Wollman Test of Reality. Life is lumpy. And a lump in the oatmeal, a lump in the throat, and a lump in the breast are not the same lump. One should learn the difference. Good night, Sig.      Felt like I was hit with a club right on my head !!

       My first ever 404 with google. All I did was click on the help on the top right corner of my gmail screen !!  urlLink      Probably I was a bit too quick in complaining about Microsoft. But I am really really surprised that no one at google has noticed it yet.

       Some images look great inside out, I mean the colours inverted the other way around.  urlLink       The source of the image, well.. atleast the last hop was from a friend of mine who is in the daily mails circle. She pops up once in a while with flowers like these, I happened to 'select' the image once and the colours were   WOW . A year back used to have a whole collection of such images. After a long time, came across a good one today and here 'tis.

       What you see below is hardly a search operation, it is a simple indexed access from Microsoft's MSDN site.   urlLink       When Microsoft is not able to index sites well within his own control properly, how are they going to index and search through millions of pages the way google does ? Google almost has the entire internet cached up. On occassions more than one, google's cache has got me content from site's that have been pulled off hook long long time back. Why would google ever want to cache or rather duplicate the entire internet locally ? For all we know, they could be testing all their fancy algorithms on the local caches before they are published to the world. But I am really happy that they have the cache such that it is accessible from the outside world too. Keep it up folks.  Now, when will MSDN be indexed without a hitch ? They make it a point not to let my bookmarks have a slightly longer life !!

       One of my favorite reads till date has been  urlLink The Seagull  book.   Interesting to know its available on the net. Why wouldnt it be ?!! Every single time I read it.. every single time I read it like its the first time. Is that because each time the content is appealling and gets forgottnen then and there ? I would love to beleive that each time I read it, creates a small change in perspective about something still left unlearnt.  On the book now, somehow the part of the book where Jonathan himself learns was what I used to find interesting. The parts where Fletcher et al., are taught was slightly on the lesser side. WAS, 'cos now when I read it. This is the part that appears to be the most interesting. Quite a small book what you find in  urlLink this link  is the entire book with a few typos here and there.  Have fun reading folks !!

       Found  urlLink this  from  urlLink Kottke's . And how did I find Kottke ? From the  urlLink Top 100 . And how did I get to the top 100 ?  urlLink This  is how !! And I got there from  urlLink Joel's  page.  That is way too many links to have in a couple of sentences, way too many hops to an interesting link. For fear of loosing the originally intended link in the haystack..  urlLink here  it is again !!
