      i really highly doubt that the green party will win in my district, but i know that i will sleep soundly tonight knowing that i voted for the party that i really believed in.   imagine what this country would be like if everyone actually voted for who they wanted to, or if it was mandatory to vote.   it could be a different place...  i will cross my fingers that stephen harper doesn't win. we don't need another george w on our hands, do we?

      ok, maybe that's a little too harsh. i do enjoy a video game now and again, but my faves are limited to tony hawk, tetris, and the sims.   i spent last night with some friends from college, who are all self-professed video game addicts. i was warned before i came over that the night was to consist of some new mind-blowing game, and some film nerd films. i thought i would even out the night by bringing over some wine and some dinner.   the night was short lived, on my part. probally b/c of the amount of alcohol and smoke i consumed, but i couldn't handle all the "gaming". and my rodding of the "gamers", probally would of left me with my ass kicked at some point in the evening, had i remained.   so i borrowed some films (american wedding, the game, nightmare before christmas, and rodger dodger), hailed a cab, and went home.   all and all a fun night....probally the best part is when we decided we were going to make popsicle stick ninga stars and pelt them down the hall at our late arrival, cory. it was hilarious...until cory picked me up and flipped me...with my head connecting with the wall...and i couldn't stop laughing...  this night will go down as "nerd fest, 2004"

      not really any plans...other than the usual domestic shit...laundry...  laundry sucks when you procrastinate and have to haul loads and loads of it down two flights of stairs and across the street and up one block. it's all my fault, but sometimes i just wish i had a w & d of my very own! (how adult of me).   keep on thinking about halifax...and that i could have my OWN apartment, minus the ghetto bathroom i currently have. i hate ugly bathrooms, mainly b/c i love to spend a lot of time in the bathtub. in my current place while i am relaxing in bubbles, i note the peeling ceiling paint, and the lovely cracked and broken tiles on the floor. very beautiful.   my martha side of me is just itching to get my hands on a new place...so i can have my first grownup apartment to decorate (and a place where i can walk around nekkid as much as i want!)

      just came home from an opening night screening of "farenheit 9/11"....very disturbing indeed.   i knew a lot of what the doc was about, but i still feel the effect deep in my stomach...that feeling of dread for all of those soldiers over in the middle east, giving up their lower-middle class lives for a backward hick redneck who barely can read the speeches he has written for him.   GO SEE THE FILM.   Michael Moore...where ever you are tonight, you can sleep soundly.   George W...karma is a bitch.   Saw this on a button after the film..."No War Nations, No Peace Classes".

      #1---people who don't call me back.  i hate it, but i am guilty of it at times. but i still hate it.  #2---boyz. most of the time.  especially when you are all geared up to be mad at them, and then they call and are all like "well, i was just wondering how you were doing...", and it crushes all hopes of you still being mad at them.  #3---bosses who nag.  i really don't like this. especially when i get in shit over stuff that i didn't do, and then get the "well, you should of been telling that person to do it right", and all i can think is: "isn't that your job?"

      got some good newz today...  sick of waiting for a phone call from halifax (and gettin' more paranoid as the dayz went on...), so i called the producer this morning, and found out that they have been swamped, and haven't put out all the calls yet.  and...  i am on a short list!  (woo hoo!)  hopefully will find out more next wk, but if all goes well, i should be moving out there for mid to late july.   it made wk sooooo much easier to deal with today. put an extra spring in my step to say the least.   peace.

      lately i have been having those kind of dreams that seem so damn real, that when you wake up, you are disappointed that they were not real.   this morning was a classic case. had a dream about another blackout...ended up with a bunch of my old school friends from back home, and weirdly enough, a guy that i wk with.   there is just one part of it that seemed so real...a bunch of us squished into the back of a friends car...and me squished in beside this wk boy...needless to say, in real life i am very much crushing on this boy right now, so being so close to him in this dream-scape car was a good deal. also the fact he put his arm around me, and held my hand the whole drive...such a little thing made me wake up this morning with a huge smile on my face, and glimmer of maybe the future? who knows...  all i know for, well, i'd say 80% feel, like he does like me. in my past 26 yrs, i have gotten to know a few things about guys, here are 2 key points:  1-they don't remember shit, unless they have a reason to remember it 2-they don't flirt with you unless they have an attraction to you  when i returned on tues from vacation, he remembered (a) where i went, (b) that i went for a wedding, and asked me about both, even though i barely remembered telling him either. and the constant flirting we have going on all day, whenever we run into each other, is good too.   i love the "before" stuff, when you are just hoping to hook up with someone...questioning everything, and knowing nothing.   i could've hung with the wk boys on friday nite, but i declined...got to keep some mystery, no?  we'll just have to see what happens...hopefully something. i don't care if it's soon, i'd rather get to know him better anyway. we'll seeeeee.....

      just woke up. must of been missing some sleep or something, cause i slept for over 12 hours, which is something that i don't normally do.   plans for the wkend...not much.   tonight going to a screening of "luck", the new sarah polley film.   tomorrow night, just my cuz's comedy show at the poor alex...sunday night live.   supposed to go to ikea at some point this wkend to help a friend pick out stuff for his new place...we'll see if that actually happens...  would like to vote today at the advance polls....green party all the way! if i voted liberal or conservative, i don't think i would be able to sleep at night. don't really have much of an opinion on the NDP party...i used to vote for them when i first started voting, cause that's who my dad voted for, but now, i am just not sure. the don't seem as bad as the rest, but that's not a good enough reason to vote for anyone.   still peeling from my sunburn...it sucks, and it's very gggggrosssss. can't wait until it's over, so i can show off my tan again!  that's all for now....

      i am still at adamm's, playing around on his g4 ibook.  it kicks my g3 ibook's ass. totally.   just burned a new mix cd for work, trying to be open minded, we will see if i have any fans after i play the cd (there are always haters in the croud...lol).   morg and graham should be here soon. i have to dig my freakin cheque book out of the u-haul. who's bright idea was it to finish my packing stoned? oh, mine. damn.   then off to the grocery store to buy some food, cause there is no sunday shoppin here, which is kinda hard to get used to. maybe i have to start going to church to have it make sense.   last night went to my friend peter's for beers with him and his lady, nikki. pete went to college with me and adamm and the rest of the crew. it was nice to see him, it's been a long time (about a year).

      ok, so i am moving into the cutest itty bitty house ever.   it's a little grandma cottage style house, on a corner lot.   2 bedrooms, livingroom, kitchen, bathroom (with an old fashioned tub! woo hoo!), unfinished basement, yard, deck, and closed in front porch running across the front of the house.   it has so much charm, and it's a little rough around the edges, but it's perfect for me, and any guests that i may have.   other cool things...a built in ironing board in the kitchen, a really high sink in the bathroom, funky old medicine cabinet in the bathroom, huge old fashioned double sink in the kitchen, stained hardwood wainscoating in the kitchen, painted white wood wainscoating in the bedroom, and hardwood floors throughout.  get keys tomorrow at 7pm.   and morgan and graham are moving in next door to another house, so we will be neighbours...awesome or what?

      the greatest beer is brewed seconds away from my new work place. fate? i think so.   work was cool today. very relaxed.   miss my posse, can't wait for them to start work on tuesday.   my new boss is the coolest dude ever. very laid back, and very fair.   my brain is like mush right now, so i am going to cut this short and write more tomorrow.   good news: may have a place, a 2 bedroom bungalow for $625/mth+, and it's about a 40 min walk from work. i don't think it gets better than that, for sure.

      hmmmm.  might have a place. just got to make a call.   which would be cool, cause i have mentally prepared myself for not sleeping in my own bed for at least a month.   though adamm's bed is quite comfy, i am only staying here until the 3rd, and then crashing at jeanette's new pad.   i would love not to have to work until tuesday, but i start tomorrow. totally only for the reason that i will get a small pay cheque next wk.   i am in rough shape, my back is killing me from all the driving and moving, my legs and arms are covered in bruises from moving, and i have mosquito bites all on my legs from drinking on the deck at the riverside in woodstock, nb, the other night. oh well, at least i am here breathing clean air!  miss some of my work folks that i know won't be coming out here for the shows.   oh well, i should be back in t.o. for halloween.

      we made it....will little incidents...  picked up our 17 ft u-haul at 9am sunday morning. went and packed my shit, went to morgan and graham's and packed their shit.   after a bit of running around, we were finally on the road at 5pm.   got into montreal at 11pm and stayed the night at friend's of morgan's downtown.  ate wicked montreal bagels n cream cheese in the morning, and got on the road by 9am.   stopped for lunch in rural quebec (gentilly). 8 different kinds of poutine on the menu. graham was brave and tried the gentilly version...fried tomatoes, onions and green peppers with cheese curds and gravy over fries. very interesting.   we were trying to make it to moncton for the night, but ended up staying in woodstock new brunswick instead, at this crazy 50's hotel called the stiles inn. went from there to have dinner and pints at the riverside (highly recommend! $3 keith's pints!) because we were all totally tired from the drive, we only downed 3 drinks each with dinner and hit it back to the hotel. i totally passed out. it was the best night sleep i have had in 2 weeks (nerves, totally).   got up at 8am, got ready, went to tim hortons, hit the highway by 9:45.   stopped for lunch at a cafe at the flight college in dieppe new brunswick. good eats for sure.   got into halifax around 4pm. had an instance of madness when we tried to pay the toll for the bridge and were in the wrong lane to fit our massive truck. the kindly toll dude directed us though. pretty funny.   all and all a great little trip...i am very happy to be here (FINALLY). 21 hours of driving...lord...  more updates and tales tomorrow!

      it was a sad day today.   the best thing about work was the people. totally.   some highlights of the day:  -texas fries at tortilla flats with the posse -margariettas in puppets -smoke breaks for those who don't smoke -not really doing any work all day -savass and the doctor making me cry (boo hoo!) -malibu rum n' ginger (thanks skinny pete) -bea paging me to her studio to hang out -finding out that buttercup broke bobs ankle the night b4 -walking out the doors, for good -cucumber wasaibi mayo (the shiz) -cute forbidden kisses -denise's cookies -many good talks: gerry, bea, kurt, rochelle, peg, adrian, denise, aaron, alex, leah, drew, andrew, nick, jim, luke, bob, rachelle, morgan, meaghan, jamie, jessica, graham, buttercup, phillip, joan, ryan, patrick, brad, etc etc etc -many j's outside still -hugs -good will -and best wishes  it's sad, another "another place, another time" situation. they suck. i have had a lot of them. i wonder if the other time will ever happen with any of them. or none, cause maybe i will find the right place at the right time, and it will just hit me in the face. fate. it's a bitch.

      some highlights of the day...  entering work in the a.m. 20 min late. morgan and graham, late as well. graham says "i just don't care. what are they going to do, fire me?" (hee hee, they are both coming to halifax with me...)   on set. waiting for the lighting guys to finish "mapping" the lights for a set i was going to take apart. people kept on coming in the studio and opening the curtains, and the gaffer was like "keep the hell out until we are DONE!", and he turns around to see the v.p. glaring at him, and covers his ass by saying..."uh, you can stay". afterwards we laughed our asses off...  5 minutes later. on the same set. i go to pull a puppet, which i think is the lighting puppet, off the set, and pull it's head off, and i am so in shock it flies out of my hand across the studio. lighting guys proceed to mock my ass. turns out it's one of the expensive puppets. oh lord.

      made $90....got rid of a shit load of stuff.   i am such a pack rat.   left a bunch of stuff out front for free...it's been there for 3 hours, and it's almost all gone. funny how many people are interested in free things...lol...  reality is coming closer...this time next week me and morgan will be on the road to montreal...then halifax by the evening of the 26th.   sad to leave such good friends i have made over the years...my e-mail address book went from 20-30 people to 200+ in the 5 years i have lived here (totally not including my non-computer box friends...hee hee).   i need this. i need to leave. i need to have a clean slate. i love the idea of toronto, but i know i will never be happy here. i feel it in my gut. something is calling to me...i have no clue what...but i know it's not here. i do have a feeling that i may stay out east for awhile, and then just see what happens. still really considering san diego, but i have to continue with my experience in my field, and hopefully end up in that area someday. just struggle with the idea of being "american"...i guess i will always be canadian, no matter where i am, but there are certain values that canadians have that i would like to instill on my future children.   goodbye smog....hello atlantic ocean!

(lorda).  well, i will be going to buy a huge cd binder so i can throw away all my cd cases...i guess that's sort of a start (ha ha ha)

      not sure what to write about today.   this blog is a total exercise for my writing...just to see if can write everyday on a computer, instead of by hand.   so far it's working...  have only given the url out to 2 people so far. just want to see if anyone else comes across this beast, and has anything to say about it.   one thing is that there are a ga-zillion of these things out there, some of which are very weird, so they get more traffic.   hmmm, maybe i have to change my blog name to something more dirtee.   nah. i am pretty plain jane, under the exterior of dirtee in real life. this is more of a reflection of the startling truth.   boring, isn't it?

      sometimes i think i am insane.   i flirt and i flirt and i flirt, but when it comes to actually making a choice, i find it really hard.   can i ever just like one person at once?   maybe it's just because i like the drama (ha ha B).  i think i should be continuing the single's game, but part of me just wants to find that person and settle down.   i just keep on thinking such "adult" thoughts...thinking about how it would be nice to have a whole cupboard of linens (weird, isn't it?), and live that "canadian" dream...husband, kids, the car, the house. the cottage and the bills.   maybe it's just because my friends are starting to get married and/or have kids. (not usually in that order).   it's my emotions just wanting to jump on the band wagon.   but the biggest part of all is that i don't want to settle. not at all. i want to be with someone that i want to be with, totally, with all my heart.   maybe i am looking to hard...need to take a chill pill and sit back, relax, and the person will just come and bring me back to reality.   who knows?

      i always find myself in bed sunday mornings, awake, contemplating my life, for at least an hour or two.   most of the time i am glad to be hogging my own bed, all to myself.   today i was just missing a certain american boy.   sad. for sure.

      no matter how good of friends you can be with someone, there comes a time when the "delete & block user" function of your e-mail comes in handy.   especially for people that are driving you nuts, in one way or other.   i usually only reserve this function for very extreme cases, as it takes a lot for me to actually do it.   stalker-like e-mails are usually a good sign.   i also recommend caller id on your home phone and cell phone to make sure that those offenders don't get in touch with you that way either.   but if they actually show up at your house, that is waaaaaaaay more of a problem. i haven't had that happen to me, but you never know with the current crazy in my life.

      at least by my standards. a bender for me is more than one night in a row where i consume more than 2 beers, and usually stumble home.   last night was a lot more than stumbling.   work has been annoying, and i very much needed the pitchers i shared with some wk folk (yummmm, apple beer...).   some people have gotten calls for halifax...apparently, they haven't started calling sets & props people yet. and i have to wait until monday to call the office, as they are closed today (and yesterday!).   going to try and sit patiently until then (yeah right).
