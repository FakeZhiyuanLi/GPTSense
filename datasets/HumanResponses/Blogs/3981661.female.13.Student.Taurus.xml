But then I found out you have to pay and download it :'( maaaan it looked so much fun :(   Oh well.   Last night was really funny. I found these mini final fantasy stories someone had made up xD they were sooooooooo so funny xD xD And then Jazz added this guy Max into our convo, and I said alot of weird stuff, like mooo, weeee and don't mess with me I'm one crazy mofo. The he said blingage for some reason. ..... LMFAO!!!!! blingage xD xD xD I was laughing so much, I forgot that I had loads of water in my glass, I thought I only had a little&nbsp;bit left. So I tipped the glass back really quick and spilt it all over my trousers xD xD xD xD lmfao   It was funneh ^-^   OH YEAH. I got another tenchi book yesturday too. Yey! Now I have 7 manga books :O:O:O   *does celebration dance*   And I found this nice dress up site. Then I found AN AMAZINGLY COOL OUTFIT *points down*   I shall name her Kito (for I had already made up someone like that, and this looked so cool I changed the story) ^______^ Kito has no last name cause she is cool :o also, Kito is a bad ass. Fighting, helping people mess up other people,&nbsp;you get the picture ^-^

       Mmmmmmm, last night we had a chinese :D:D yummmmmmmmm I love Chinese food xD     &nbsp;   Mwahahahaha. Today I took the names Ichigo and Zakuro on habbo hotel xD Now their MINE forever :D     &nbsp;   Yay! I'm gonna see Jazz (my best friend) today :D But first I have to go to the library and go to see my grandpa.&nbsp;^ _&nbsp; ^       Yesturday I drew some more pictures. I drew Lulu (from final fantasy 10), a chocobo and Eiko (from final fantasy 9). I shaded the picture of Eiko, cause one of my friends said my pictures would look great with shading in it. It was the first time I'd done shading, and&nbsp;I think it doesn't look very good :I Mum says its good. I'll show Jazz later. If it looks rubbish I'll just blame it on Ricky (the friend who said I should shade) xD     &nbsp;   I better gooo now. Times a wastin     &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looove Zen xxx     &nbsp;

      Hi there. This is myyyy blog. It'll probably be boring, but hey, you can laugh at my misfortune if you like ^_^      Lets see. Today I got another Tokyo Mew Mew book (:D) Its the third one. It rocks. Ichigo turns into a cat and gets taken home by Masaya (her crush)!! And at the end they finish it with Ryou leaning forward to kiss Ichigo!!!! I WANNA KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!! I NEED the fourth book. Right now. I hope Ichigo pushes him away so I can have Ryou all&nbsp;to myself. Bwahahaha.     Hmm what else happened today. Not much :P. Oh, its the last day of school. But that doesn't really matter to me right now. ^_^     &nbsp;   My fat cat was sick this morning. She ate her breakfast too fast xP. Ross (my brother) chased me round the kitchen with one of those mops where it sprays stuff when you push the handle. Apart from that, not much has happened so far.     &nbsp;   Oh, we're gonna see spiderman 2 tonight. That'll be fun. Hopefully. ^_^     &nbsp;   Well, I better go. Takeshi's castle is nearly on the Tv.     &nbsp;   Seeya!!    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; loooooove Zen xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;

Its soooo fun!! Its basicly tetres but it has groovy music and a anime face in the corner :D  Eh, I kinda ordered too many books off amazon, now I have to ask dad whenever I order something xD I ordered them right, like one each week, but I didn't keep track of how much they cost :l  Oh yea, we had a massive thunder storm though. I used to be really scared of thunder, but I'm kinda ok about it now. Its kinda fun xD But not when its right above the house :l  Waaaa Its reeeeally hot :(:(:(:( I can't wait to go on holiday. It'll be cool in Scotland. Well, it'll probably be freezing, but I like cold better than hot. I hope it doesn't rain too much.  I'll hopefully see Jazz this week. And I wanna go into town. I haven't been in for weeks.  Wellll I'd better go :P  seeya  Zen xxxx
