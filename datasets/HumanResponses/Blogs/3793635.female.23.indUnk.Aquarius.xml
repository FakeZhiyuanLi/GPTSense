      So my next door neighbor, aka my boss and his family are out of town for the week and asked me to get the mail and feed the fish of 3 years. So I've been doing goodon getting the mail and talking to Lou (the fish) and feeding it. So today, I went to feed him, and he's dead. YIKES! What am I supposed to do? If anyone knows my history with fish, I kill them all, not on purpose, just accident, but still. I always used to get 2 gold fish from my uncle when I was little. And everytime we left the house, most of the time to go shopping, Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dumb were dead. Now, I told my boss that I'm not very good with fish, but he still left Lou in my care. Needless to say I'm going to buy another fish, but do I tell him? YIKES!  On a brighter note, I'm leaving tomorrow for New Hampshire for one for good friends weddings. I was with them on their first date, and she even had to call me to find out where their first kiss was, so needless to say I am very happy for them and can not wait to be out east again. I love it out there so much. The only bad part about the trip is the 10 hour drive, but well I enjoy road trips, just not in a car that is a stick that I'm still a little shakey on driving. We'll get there eventually.   Everyone have a good 4th of July and I'll be posting pictures of my funfilled weekend when I get back! Be safe and have fun!

      Welcome everyone, so this is my first blog entry and I'm way excited. Not sure anyone will read it or comment, but it's still fun! SO I really don't do much exciting stuff until the weekend becuase I work all week, which well, is pretty sad, but hey, welcome to the real world. So I'll catch everyone up on my nice relaxing weekend at home, which was well needed.  Friday night I decided to be antisocial, which everyone needs to be once in a great while. So I bought some movies and vegged in my room. Well I didn't actually veg, one of the movies I got "You Got Served" made me want to get up and dance, so I did, like a fool, in my room on my own! "I've got moves youve never seen." Anyway, watched that and then radio and hit the sac!  Saturday morning was the usualy ritual with my mom, my best friend Linds, and her mom to the farmer's market, the country stores, lunch, and grocery shopping. Then it was off to my good friend, Carla's house on the lake for the rest of the day. We didn't do much, mainly caught up (Carla lives in Chi town), and had some drinks, ate a ton of food (we always get fat when we go over there) and just enjoyed some nice r & r by the water.  Sunday was another jam packed day (not really) Laid out with Linds by the pool and then over to B's on the lake. I am a crispy critter (burnt for those who don't know) but it's a good base. Then it was off to Outback (one of my favorite palces) for my little bro's birthday, he's all grown up, 17! I feel old, and then I joined my mom, grandma, grandpa, and two aunts at my Uncle Bob's AA meeting in Brighton, he has been sober and drug free for 5 years and I am so proud of him.   Worked yesterday and today as usual, I'm supposed to be going to my soccer game right now, but Linds talked me into shopping instead, I know I"m terrible, but hey, can you blame me?

      Well, it's Friday, the day I look forward to the most, but I wish that it was Friday yesterday and today was Saturday. I had a pretty good week thus far, and I think it hit it's peak already so now I just need to wind down. Here's my run down from the week and&nbsp; a look forward to the weekend.   On Tuesday I ran to Royal Oak to pick up the cutest skirt for my big night out on the town on Thursday. Then I got a call from my friend Gary and stopped by to listen to Potential Records first album. So I chilled there with him for&nbsp;a while and talked about the CD Release party on Thursday, discussed outfits and just Potential Record stuff. The CD is AWESOME and I'm not just saying that. Check out the website ( urlLink www.thatswussup.com ) You can listen to samples of Chief's stuff.   Wednesday was mine and Linds' big shopping day. We had to find cute tops for the party on Thursday. Let me tell you that was a long shopping trip, we went to several stores, and then back again, shopping for 5 hours, all just to get Linds a jean skirt that she was not going to wear to the party, and me a $5.00 black tank to go with the cutest white skirt in the world. (I know that you all want to see it, maybe if I&nbsp;can post pics at some point again). Then we drove home in a monsoon but made it. I had to pack for THursday night, then it was off to bed   Thursday (7/22) had to work all day and was very antsy. I had been listening to the CD nonstop since I got it on Tuesday. At 5:30, Linds, Beth and I were on our way to Dearborn Heights to eat some dinner, get our drink on and get ready in the swelltering heat for the big night.&nbsp; Well, we got ready and then Stal and Bethany showed up, took some picutres and then we were off to Downtown Detroit to the Panecea for the big party/concert and we were looking HOTT! Got downtown after a little detour aournd 10:30 or so and did a little dancing and a little mingeling. Ran itno some friends from High school who were out to Support Gary and Chief and Potential Records. It was awesome.&nbsp; A lot of performances by Johnny Saxx (Yani), some group from Pittsburgh that went to school with Dave (Chief), and of course Chief and the crew. I took a ton of pictures, and they even pulled Bethany up on stage (tried to get her to show her tatas but she wasn't having it). I'll try and post some pics when I get the 3 rolls back that I took. But you all should check out the site and listen to a sample!  urlLink www.thatswussup.com .   Today was a little hard to wake up, but thank god I did not have a hang over. Had to be at work at 8:00 and was even early, but I'm dragging ass right now. I have to stay late tonight and am supposed to go to a "Sleep Over Party" at my friends Shannon's house, but who knows if I'll make at the rate I'm going right now. Tomorrow I have wedding #8 to go to tomorrow and then 3 softball games on Sunday. What are you all doing this weekend, how was your week? Please check out the website, not kidding, I wouldn't reccommend it if I didn't like it. It's some good stuff!

      What a weekend! That is all I have to say. Here's the run down and lot sof pics (sorry they are so big, I can't figure out to make them smaller like the others)  &nbsp;  Friday after work Linds and I packed up the car for our mini vacay road trip to our favorite little Ohio town, Independance. Like every other time down there, it was raining, a ton. We had to make a pit stop in Brighton which took forever, we had to pick up pictures and get plastic cups for jello shots (that we never ended up making). Then we were finally on the road. We arrived in Inde around 10:00 and just chilled at Mark's with him, Chrisann, and Carey, later Brian and his girlfriend Alaina showed up and we decided to head to this little bar in Inde, Panini's for a little electric bowling. (if you don't know what it is, ask me, every bar should have one, it is soooo much fun) Check out the pics below for a fun Friday night recap!   UNDER CONSTRUCTION!!! GRRR!!!!   &nbsp;Kay so I have been trying all week to figure out to post the pictures like in the other entry, but well for some reason it won't do it.&nbsp; So I'll do a small recap. Have an exciting week ahead of me!  On Saturday (7/17) we just layed around at Mark's and did nothing like we usually do. However Mark and Chrisann made this really good meal for us (chicken, brocolli, potatoes, and salad with rolls!) It was awesome and a good meal in our tummy's for a hard night of drinking. We then decided to go to the Warehouse district, mine and linds' first time. We went to The Blind Pig and had a great time. Did a lot of dancing and even more drinking. On our way out we tried to get a cab (we always get one when we go downtown) and seriously I felt like I was on an episode of the Real World, there were people arguing and fighting over the cabs, including very angry bachelorettes who flicked us off. Which well Bachelorettes lead me to my next little story. One of the guys who was with us, who will remain nameless decided to tell a bachelorette party that we was a stripper, so he went back home with them. I don't know how he got home b/c he had no money and didn't know where he was, but he showed up back at Marks. I went to bed, I was tired and very drunk, but while I was sleeping some more drama went down that I will leave you all in dark about, except for the ones who know about it.   On Sunday (7/18) Linds and I had to get up bright and early because I had to be home by 3:00 for my first softball game. (I know this is a bit of a shocker, but I have become athletic since I left college, and it is so much fun). Anyway the ride home was awful, I got kind of sick and wasn't sure I was going to be able to play ball, but then somewhere aroung ANn Arbor, I got a sudden burst of energy and was ready to play. We were supposed to have a double header but our first game kept getting called due to lightening and then they cancelled our second game. But we got mercied in the 5th inning. It was our first game, but we'll get better. I can't wait for next week, 3 games in one day, it will be long, but hopefully the weather will cooperate.

      I love Friday's and I think pretty much everyone can agree with me. Nothing really exciting happend this week. I just worked like usual, and I had softball practice which is totally fun and I can not wait for our first game on Sunday.  &nbsp; Linds and I are heading down to our mini vacay spot, Ohio, this weekend and I can not wait to get out of here! Not that it's bad here, I just like traveling and visiting people. I'm not too sure Linds is as excited as she was about going, the guy she has liked for a year or so is back with his ex girlfriend who has cheated on him. Well they have both cheated on each other but I guess if the sex is good you know.  &nbsp; So this topic has brought me to a great quesiton that I don't think anyone will know the answer to. WHY ARE GUYS SO DUMB? Kay I know girls aren't the smartest either, but come on now. You could hand a guy the perfect girl on a silver platter, someone who is sweet, caring, funny, pretty, shares the same interests, gets along great with your friends, has a life, a career, money, an education, and still, the guy turns it down for the slutty girl, the girl who creates drama, is moody, and so on. I just don't get it. I mean I know guys my age really only want one thing, and that's fine, I can totally understand that because we all need to get a little every now and then, and when they don't want it, then maybe those good girls will have a chance? I don't know why any guy in his 20's would want a girlfriend in the first place. This is my philosophy on girlfriends, and if you're one of my guy firends, you've heard me say this before. Girlfriends take all your money, want all your time, it's always your fault and it's never good enough. That's just how girls are at this age, and well at least I can see and admit that. And I'm not saying I'm any different, but I have learned a lot from a past relationship and have grown up quit a bit in the whole relationship/friend with benefit aspect. And I'm not saying relationships are bad, they are&nbsp;awesome, knowing that you always have that person, someone to snuggle with when you just feel like snuggling, someone to laugh with and share things with, someone you can call at 2:00 in the monring when you get home from the&nbsp;bar, or when your scared when your power goes out, but then&nbsp;it sucks if you depend soley on them. There needs to be that balance of together time and apart time and not to take advantage of either. Kay that is enough of my lecture. &nbsp;If you have any insight on the guy thing, or even an explanation about having a girlfriend I would love to know answers.  &nbsp; Besides all that I have discovered that my friends and I, as we are getting older, we have become a tid bit picky on guys in general. I don't know why, but it is nuts! Some of us won't even talk to a guy if he has bad shoes on with his outfit, has bad teeth, has a bad hair cut, can't hold a conversation, has no direction in his life, has a bad family life. Now I know that some of these things are a bit petty, but well, I guess we are just starting to realize what we want and we are not going to settle like we used to. Maybe it jsut comes iwth our age. And at this point I'm done with guys for while, sure I love having them around, sometimes guys are much easier to be friends with the girls are, but I don't want to date anyone, or be with anyone, I want my time, my down time, my fun time, my time with my girls, my time to do what ever I want and not have to put up with anything else.  &nbsp; WOW, kay now that I have put you all to sleep I think I am done with my outlook for now on relationships. I hope I don't sound bitter, I'm not, just a little confused about relationships and how the heck one is supposed to find the one that they are supposed to be with. It boggles my mind. Let me know what you all think. Hope everyone has a great weekend. Look forawrd to some crazy pictures from this weekend.

      So I think everyone should be very proud of me, I figured out how to post my pictures all by myself. Needless to say it was a process, but I did it and I am very proud of myself. Kay enough about that, let's get to the fun stuff.   Everyone knows how much I live for my weekends, this past weekend was no exception. Linds met me at work and we headed to Royal Oak to her sisters house. Then we headed to my old home town of Saint Clair Shores to the Beach Club to see the M-80's play. (for anyone who doesn't know who they are, they played all the time at MSU and are a kick ass 80's cover band) The bar was pretty sweet, a bit of an older crowd. It's right on Lake Saint Clair and all the big boats come and park in the marina, you basically get off the boat and come and party.    urlLink    Linds and ! at the Beach Club&nbsp; urlLink     Lindsey's sisters, Arin's, friend started to get a migrain so we took off and headed back to Royal Oak, where Arin dropped us off at Woody's and we met up with my friend Becky from the cruise and her friend Missi. We had a good time and it was really good to see Becky and Missi again and meet some of their friends. The four of us are hoping to go on a cruise in April together, I'm keeping my fingers crossed.    urlLink    Back and I at Woody's&nbsp; urlLink      urlLink    Linds, me, Missi, and Beck at Woody's&nbsp; urlLink     Linds and I had to wake up super early in the morning to go with Arin and Heather to the Humane Society to pick up the new additions to the family. Arin got a new kitty, a little boy named Koda, he is so cute and loves to cuddle.    urlLink    Arin's new kitty, Koda&nbsp; urlLink     Heather got a puppy, Lucy, she's a black lab and is 5 months old. She was out of control in the car, and even pooped in the back. When we let her out, she just ran herself in circles around the yard.    urlLink    Heather's new puppy, Lucy&nbsp; urlLink     So all day on Saturday we played with the animals and ended up going to Petco for some random things, and this is where I found her.....(see below)This is the dog from Fur ever home that I wanted to adopt so bad. My dog Goldie and her would get along so well, but my parents would have killed me. I just fell in love with her, and am still working on it with my parents. How could you not fall in love with that face?    urlLink    The dog I fell in love with, Rosie, needless to say she isn't mine&nbsp; urlLink     After we got all the play time in with the new pets, Linds and I did a little shopping in Royal Oak and got some ice cream at the best ice cream place ever, Cold Stone Cremery and then headed home.   Nothing too exciting happened the rest of the weekend. Watched a movie with Linds on Saturday night, went and did the usual Panera, and grocery shopping with the mom's. Then I gave my car a huge bath, I'm talking, wash, wax, vac, clean the inside, conditoned the leather, cleaned under the hood. Gordy, my car is very happy with me now. Sunday night I chilled a good friends house and caught up, hadn't seen him in a while so that was fun.   Now I"m just looking forward to my weekend. We're going to our mini vacay spot, Independence Ohio. So look forward to some crazy pics and crazy stories soon.   Hope everyone is doing well, let me know how you like my blog and the pics!

      So usually I love hump day, because it also equals pay day for me, but not today, due to the holiday. But in a way it feels like Tuesday so then tomorrow will feel like Wednesday and pay day will come and then the weekend. So I can't really complain.   I'm trying to post some darn pictures from the wedding and I don't know how to do it. I have them scanned into my computer and now I just need a little help, so if any of you are bored enough to read this, and can help me, just let me know. It will be greatly appreciated, and if I see you I might evenmake you brownies. HEHEHE.   Although it's only Wednesday I'm trying to figure out what to do this weekend. I know, pathetic, but I told you I live for my weekends. So here are mine and Lindsey's options. Go tot Chi-town to visit our friend Carla, go up to my grandparents and lay out on the lake all day and do nothing and be waited on hand and foot, or go down to our fav little place, Ohio! What to do, what to do.   That's about it for me, nothing much to look forward to, but my friend Ang is coming over to chill tonight and I haven't seen her since 1982, so I'm excited about that. Anyone have anything exciting going on their lives?

      Well I'm back from New Hampshire. And let me tell you, I'm happy to be home, but at the same time wish I was back out there. If you know me, you know how much I love the East Coast and know that everytime I go out there, my family wonders if I'll come home. I almost stayed again this time, especially since the Dave Matthews concert was at the Tweeter center on Tuesday. So here is the run down of my wondrful weekend on the East Coast. (I"ll post pics as soon as I get them, I still don't have a digital)  On Thursday morning we left the house at 6:00 am, hoping to get to NH by 7:00 so that I could spend some time with Jenn. Well that didn't happen. Of course I fell asleep as soon as I got in the car and then woke up to discover that we had missed the QEW in Canada and ended up in Toronto 30 minture out of our way. When we turned around, it was a parking lot for about an hour. Then at the boarder, anouth 2 hours, and another parking lot. So I busted out the laptop and watched Finds ing Nemo. (I felt like a 6 year old). After making it through to New York and into Buffalo, the expressway we were supposed to take had a really bad accident on it and was shut down, so was had to seek alt routes. We finally ended up in NH at the Hotel by 11:30. YES a very long day, and it was not my idea to drive, so you can imagine.  Friday I had to see Jenn, so we drove around looking for the spa where she was getting her nails done and finally found it after an hour. (more car time) Hung out there for a bit and talked and caught up. Then this lady brought in her new chocolate lab puppy and he was soooo cute, this little rollie pollie thing and I wanted to take him home. After that we were going to go to the beach and then to Boston for the eveing, but we scraped that idea and we went to Newport Rhode Island, another one of my favorite places on the East Coast. Again on the way there, traffic jam, that was the story of the trip. But we made it there and walked around and did a little shopping and had a good time. Upon our arrival back at the hotel I joined Jenn in the Presidential Suite with her briadsmaids, and had some, ok a lot of chocolate and stayed up late telling fun stories about weddings and her and Sean.   Saturday was the big day. Jenn woke me up bright and early, 8:00 to be exact, and she wanted me to come up and play and get ready with her, so upon the brides request I went. I helped with random things, and painted nails and just hung out and eventaully got ready myself, and then it was off to the ceremony. Jenn looked gorgeous, and well Sean cleans up pretty well too. The wedding was beautiful and I am so happy that they are finally married. Tagged along with them to the park to take pictures and got some really good ones and then off to the reception for a little dancing and a lot of drinking. Had a great time there dancing with everyone and the groomsmen were so funny. They even had a dance contest for Red Sox tickets (Sean is a HUGE Sox fan) Needless to say I didn't win them,b ut this old couple did and I was very impressed with their dancing skills.   Sunday was up early again for brunch and then back on the road, and a little convinceing to come home instead of stopping in Ontario at the Falls. I was tired, not feeling well, and just wanted to come home. So on the road, watched another movie, I think I watched the Lion King this time and then we stopeed at the Falls for dinner, and headed home! (YAY! My own bed, there is nothing like it.)   All in all it was a good weekend, too short though. I hate leaving Jenn, I always cry and her mom always tells me that I belong out there. One day I'll get out there, maybe meet someone and never come home. HEHEHEH, probably not. So today I am off to do some errands, wash clothes, I hate unpacking, and take my pictures in. And then it is off to work tomorrow. I hope you all had a great weekend. Let me know how it was.

          OH the joys of having the whole house to myself this weekend! It made want to safe that much more for my own place. So I had the house to myself this weekend starting Thursday night when I had my laundry room incident. After that little mishap, the weekend was smooth sailing!  Friday night Linds and I went on a little shopping spree! I got so much stuff for some great deals. I'm excited about them, so let me tell you! I got a pair of Express khaki's for $29.00 (org $49.00), a new black Express hoodie - super cute, has satin around the pockets, satin ribbons and satin all in the hood for $20.00 (org #40.00), a wicked cute halter top to wear out on Saturday night from Forever 21 for $12.00 (that was the original price) a black Poncho from Marshall Fields for $20.00 (not sure how much it was orginally but it was on sale) and really cute earrings that I have been looking everywhere for, for $.53 (org $8.00). SO needless to say I am super excited about my purcahses. Then we rented movies, 13 Going on 30, Honey (I bought that) and You got Served (bought that too, hey I like to dance and love to to watch it too). While watching the movie we had some Taco Bell and then had a spa night which consisted of pedicures and facials, all to prepare for our big night out on Saturday. It was a late night, but it had it's bonuses. (Linds you know what I mean hehehe)  Saturday I did the usual into Brighton trip with Linds and her mom, this time I was momless, which was a little strange. We went to the art fair and to lunch, then Linds and I headed to the outlet mall for some more shopping. Got the cutest Boom Boom skirt (as ANg would call it) from the Guess outlet for $29.00 (org $60.00). Then home to watch another movie, take a nap, practice some dance moves that was a special feature on the DVD and to get ready.  Saturday night was awesome! Linds Cristal and I went out to the State Theatre for a little dancing. On our way we missed the lodge and got lost a little bit, then we had to go to the bathroom and stopped I don't know where. The only reason the guy at the gas station let us in was because we were girls in short skirts. We finally got to the State around 12:00 and the line was around the building. I was supposed to be meeting someone there, and felt awful. THe line was only 10 min long so it wasn't that bad, we danced all night and hung out with my firend and his friends that we met up there. Didn't get home until 4:300 in the monring, but it was well worth it.  Sunday I had my softball game, we lost both games, and I got wacked in the shine with the ball, but it was still a fun day. Already looking forward to this coming weekend. Another night at the State, (we got free passes) and another weekend with my friend Ang, and I even have a date on Friday night, it's not really a date, we're just oging to the movies and maybe dancing, with a guy friend. . I know a little shocking,

          I don't house sit very often, but when I do, there always seems to be an adventure involved, ecspecially recently. Just to recap when watching over my neighbor's house (which my boss lives in) I had to feed the family fish that they had for 3 years and it dies on me (see blog post from June 30th)  This week I was asked by another neighbor to water the flowers (not a problem, it rained every day they were gone), bring in the mail and put it in the box in the garage (the garage back door would be opened). PROBLEM. I forgot to get the mail for about 3 days, then when I did get it, I went to put it in the box like I was told to, the garage door was looked, so I took it home. Then I was asked to take the garbage down on Thursday morning, not a problem. That is until I discovered that the garbage cans were not outside like at my house, but in the garage, where the door was locked. So I decided to try the door one more time, it worked, and the garbage was taken out, and the mail put in it's proper spot.  This is the grand daddy of them all and it's at my own house, so regardless I wasn't house sitting, but I am the only one home until Sunday. So I decided that I was going to be productive last night when I got home from work and clean my room, and do some laundry. Everything was going great, just chillin by myself and what not. Then I went to take my dried dark clothes out of the dryer and switch the lights into the dryer. When I walked into the hallway, I noticed the rug was all wet, then when I opened the laundry room door, there it was, a huge flood, up to my ankles. A sock from teh darks clogged up the sink drain where the washer drains out to. So there it was, water everywhere, everything was soaked. It was awful. I cleaned it all up, but what a mess. I suggest to everyone to make sure that there is nothing in the way of the drains, and when I get my own house one day there will be a drain on the floor of the laundry room.  I like to think that I'm a very responsible person, and I am very cautious about other people's homes and what not, but wow, not a very good record in house sitting. So if you want me to house sit for you anytime, I would suggest waiting a while until this bad luck in house sitting wears off.

      So, everyone makes New Year's Resolutions, and since I have so much time at work, I thought why can't we make half-way-through-the-year resolutions. See here are my half-way-thourhg-the-year resolutions!  1.) Loose 20 pounds by November (I have to fit into and look good in the wedding I'm in) 2.) Save money (so that one day I can eventually move out and not be in debt, go to Europe in 2006 with my friends, and go on a cruise with my lil bro) 3.) Put out more resumes (kay I really need to get crackin on putting my degree to use, I want an advertising or PR job!) 4.) Pay my parents back (really someone else should be doing this, or at least a large part of it, but well I won't see any money from him) 5.) Keep better in touch with my friends who live out of state (either go vist, call or write more) 6.) keep better in touch with my sorority sisters (mainly my lil's, they were such a huge part of my college career and they mean the world to me, I"m just bad at keeping in contact) let's add to that, keep better in touch with all my freinds from college. 7.) Remain drama free (I know some of you are thinking that this is not possible, but I promise it is. Right now I have no drama in my life and it is so wonderful, I'm in such a great mood) 8.) Spend more time with my little brother (he's going to be a senior and well, he's growing up and I didn't spend much time with him when we were younger)  I think that's about it. I can't think of anymore, but if I do, I'll add them. Now, when I'm not doing something to follow my resolutions, you are welcome to call me out on it. Looking forward to the weekend, when am I not?

           I had a GREAT weekend! My partner in crime, Lindsey was out of town, so I was on my own this weekend, and I did just fine. (I know I'm pathetic). I was in such a great mood all weekend, and well have been for a while, I love it (I think it's because I have no drama in my life anymore and it's awesome!) So anyway here was my great weekend!  Friday was my boy Herman's Birthday, Happy Birthday sweetie! Wish I could have been there to celebrate with you! I hope you had a great day and enjoyed your time with your mom. I didn't do much, just chilled at home, did my laundry and vegged, I was so asleep by 10:00 and it was wonderful.   Saturday was my me day! I cleaned my room, I mean really cleaned. I threw a bunch of stuff out that hed been laying around since I re-did my room and just stuff that I didn't need anymore. Then I gave myself a pedicure and a facial and packed up my stuff and headed to my friend Angie's in Ann Arbor. It was so good to see her again. We caught up over some pizza and a drink and then got ready to go dancing at the State Theatre downtown. I love getting ready with Ang, she wears the same size so it's double the clothes options. We got to the State around 11:00 and danced until 2:00 am. We ran into an old friend/football player, Derek from school, and met some nice guys who saved us from a fight in the middle of the dance floor and then walked us to our car. There are nice guys out there, it's amazing. We got home late and popped in the movie Honey and went to bed. I can't wait to do it again next weekend, I love dancing.  Sunday was the big softball day! We played 2 games and did pretty well even though we lost both games. At least we didn't get mercied like last time we played the two teams. My grandparents were in town so they came to watch along with my aunt and 2 cousins. Then we had a bbq at my aunts. It was good to see my grandparents again, I haven't seen them in forever and I miss them terribley.   Today is my mom's birthday, so we get to take her out to dinner tonight and give her her b-day present which I am very exctied about and can not wait to steal. HAPPY BIRTHDAY MOM! Love you.   Hope everyone is having a good day and a good start to the week. Let me know what is up!

      Anyone who knows me, knows that one of my biggest pet peeves is not returning phone calls. Now I have come to some kind of understanding that there are 2 types of people in this world, those who return phone calls, and those who return them, but not for weeks or months later. So when peeps don't return my calls I try to make them feel real bad by leaving the "are you still alive" message on the voicemail. So you can imagine how excited I was when my 2 favorite guys FINALLY called me back last night, after trying to get a hold of them for probably about 3 weeks.  My first call came from an old friend, Mr. Chris Slevin. I haven't seen Chris since Christmas, but we have talked and tried to get together when he comes home, it just doesn't ever seem to work out. Chris was suppsoed to come home this summer, move back in with the rents, but was offered a job for the summer out in South Haven, so he took it. (He graduated from WMU and used to be a bouncer at Waldo's) I was pretty bummed when I called him and found out that he was staying on the west side for the summer and had been trying to get a hold of him for about a month now and he finally called me back. So you can imagine how excited I was, even though I didn't answer my phone ( I was in the middle of a movie) But I will call him back tonight, I hope he comes home soon, he's my best guy friend, that I can tell anything to, and I miss his company and just chillin and watching movies with him.  Then, my favorite Beta finally returned my call last night. Herman is the worst at retruning phone calls, but I let him get away with it. Just hearing his voice on my voicemail made me smile. I miss my boys! Friday is Herman's birthday and I haven't seen him since June and I miss his ass. I love catching up with old friends who I haven't seen in so long. There is just something comforting knowing that no matter what, old friends can pick up where they left off.  Although I didn't talk to either one, know that I will call both back on my way home from work today! Just wanted to clear that up. So that was my return phone calls and my smiles. Now on to my beautiful weather!  Has anyone taken a look outside today. It is GORGEOUS! It's a little windy but I can handle that. It's a little cool and the weather just reminds me that fall is around the corner, my favorite time of the year. It equals October, (my fav month), changing of the colors, the cidar mill, pumpkins, and of course my fav holiday, Halloween. Now I know i'm jumping the gun and it will probably get up to 90 again before we actually hit fall, but well just the thought of it makes me in a good mood.  I hope you are all enjoying the weather and the week, and just think one more day until the weekend, hope you enjoy it!

      So, ever just have one of those days where you don't really know what to do, where to go, and you just need to clear your head of all the craziness that is going on, almost feel like starting over? well today was one of those days. After work I had Chinese with my mom that I have been craving for days. We had good conversation at dinner, mostly about my little brother. It's his Senior year in high school and I couldn't be more proud of him, but my mom is scared. She can't understand how I can be so organized about my life, since I was young, I thought I had everything planned out, and how Ky is such a go with the flow person and things just fall into his lap. He is an amazing kid, and I hope he knows that. After talking about how lucky he is and how he seems to just come across good luck in his life, I came to a generalization that guys just have it easier, becasue 1.) they aren't girls, and they don't stress about stuff, 2.) most of them seem to take things in stride, maybe I should have been a boy, but then I may have turned out gay because sometimes I'm so anal about stuff. After dinner I met my friend Beth for a movie. Of course a girlie movie and then that got me thinking about how I'll probably end up alone the rest of my life. I have always been the hopeless romantic one, the little girl who always dreamed about her wedding, always had some guy that I liked, wore my heart on my sleeve, and got a broken heart countless times. After the movie, I just drove around for an hour, turned up my radio and rolled down my windows and just drove to nowhere (eventually home, but pretty much nowhere). During that ride, I came to the realization that for the first time that I can remember, I don't like any guys, I'm not worried about making out with anyone, I'm ok with going to 9 weddings in one year and not having the same date, if I even have a date to any of them, and I deteremined that I'm alright for the first time with being alone. I have so much that I want to do in my life and I think that my new goal is to get it all in order. I look at so many people my age and look up to them so much for all the wonderful things they have accomplished and prey that I am as successful as they are. I think everyone might hit this point in their life, and well I may have hit mine a little late, but at least I hit it, I might need a little push of encouragement so all the help and push is very much welcome!

      WOW, had it been a while since I typed my blog, that is how exciting my life is right now. But I have surprisingly been busy, just with work and what not. Plus it's not like anyone really reads my blog anyhow, so sad. Here's a run down of what I have been up to since my last entry.  So that Friday night (my last entry, July 23) I literally did nothing!!!! After work, I picked Linds up and we ended up renting 2 movies. (The Company, and Along Came Polly). So there we are chillin watching The Company, a ballet movie that really had no plot for the first 15 minutes of. It was basically a documentary on the students at the Geoffery Ballet, something only a dancer would appreciate. So I turned it off and decided I wouldn't boar Linds to death, she had sat through enough of my dance productions and popped in Along Came Polly. I really couldn't tell you if it was good, fell asleep within the first 10 min. Sad I know.  Saturday night my friend Beth and I went to a co-workers wedding reception and had a blast there with him and his wife and all his friends. (Make this wedding #9, I only have one more to do this year, and so sad that I haven't even had a steady date to any of them, oh well)  Sunday was a triple header in Softball and I had so much fun, we lost 2 of the 3, but still it was good times, got some sun and got to spend some time with my dad, which is always fun.  Ahhh, Monday, the work week begins. I had my review last Friday (July 30) and it went very well. I was very happy. I went up in markings since last quarter and have made more money with my customer also. My boss said that I hit a low point though this quarter, which I did, but that my attitude has gone up and my spirits are back to normal, and so am I. And well, I knew that I had hit a bump in my life and at work at one point, but I like the way it is now, back to normal. I'm young and well I can't worry about everything.  Then Friday, my favorite day of the week rolled around and Linds and I were off to Ohio again to celebrate Chrisann's birthday. We got there late on Friday night and went to the Winking Lizard for a drink and then played Scene It until 4 in the morning. Nothing like drunken board games with friends where you are all screaming at the TV! Saturday we all started drinking pretty early that is after we made a ton of jello shots taco dip and pain killers. A ton of Mark and Chrisann's friends showed up and there was a lot of dancing, a round of President and Ass Hole, poker, and a ton of drinking. Linds, Chris, and I were pretty wasted by 11:00 and I started with the water, and didn't seam to sober up until I woke up the next morning. We're still trying to piece together the night, but well we know that we had fun. (if I can figure out how to post my pics again, I will)  Then it was back home yesterday and I made in time for my softball game, and we won, and I actually hit the ball and made a ton of base runs. (I became the designated runner for a few people who were injured). After the game got over, I ran into 2 old friends from Middle School, Rick and Rob Essenburg. I haven't seen them in probably 7 years so all day today at work Rob and I emailed back and forth and cuaght up. It was good to see them again and I am looking forward to more remember when's. I love running into old friends and reuniting the friendship again. It's like getting to know each other all over again, it's great!  Not much going on this weekend, I'm going to lay back and relax, maybe paint my shlef for my room and do some cleaning, and more job searching.  Would love to hear from everyone, or whoever checks this. Let me know how you are all doing. See I told you I have no life!
