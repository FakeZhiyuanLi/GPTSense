      I talked to him for the first time online today.  I've tried a few times before, but I figured he didn't know who I was so he didn't accept my message.  We got to talk for about half an hour or so (which is about fifteen minutes in real time).  Poor guy, he's feeling sick, but he said he's planning on coming on Friday/Saturday.  I know he's not coming for me or anything, I mean, it IS his sister's birthday, but I'm glad to be able to talk to him more.  It was so weird though, last night I was hanging out with her and she would mention something about his plans to come down and I would be more updated on it and I couldn't tell her because I don't know how she'd react to all of this.  Not like anything is really happening, but the fact that we're basically talking behind her back. . .not because we don't want her to know, but because she asked me to.  I just feel sick about it, kinda. It's not like I started liking him intentionally to bother her.  I liked him the day I met him.  I probably would have kept touch with him before if I had his information.  I know, I know, I'm HER friend, but every time I would remember that night we hung out or anytime she talked about him, I just would smile and have a quick memory in my head of him.  Always remembered fondly.  It sucks that I can't talk to her about it though.  Now two of my sisters and three of my guy friends know and she has no clue. :(  Well, I'm not going to pretend either way. Tomorrow.

      Eh, I'm not even sure anyone reads this, but I've got to vent a bit.  I think I've royally screwed up now.  I told one of my friends something that I knew she might not react well to.  Now, she's being all weird.  I think the worst part is the weirdness of it.  Y' see, I told her that I like her brother and I got the reaction that is a kind of "you're not good enough for my brother" reaction.  It kinda hurt, okay, it really hurt.  She didn't actually say that or anything but dangit.  Yeah, I like a couple guys at a time and all, but that doesn't mean I'll be mean or wreckless with his heart.  I'm not like that at all.  Man, this sucks.  I just want to cry.  I mean, I'm not a terrible person, but the fact that no one thinks I'm good enough for anyone just sucks.  I mean, I do pretty well for myself.  I'm not a snob or a terrible person, am I?  It just sucks.  Crappit!  Eh, I'm in an "I'm not good enough" mood and it'll stay that way.  Grrr!  I think I'll calm down and chill.  Maybe a good cry.

       There was a time where I had at least four online journals.  Two were hidden to most, one was hidden to  all  but one. . .then two. . .now three. . .and the original one seems to be lost forever.  I now find myself creating a second just for the sake of having a primary and secondary journal (I closed the two hidden one ages ago.  So, here I am, for random ramblings and possibly more.
