      So going with the whole theme of getting healthier and more active me and one of my best friends went to a batting cage.  Now for those of you who don't know what this is... it's a long room.. like a dog run.. surrounded by wise mesh fencing or like in this case, four seperate areas sectioned off by hanging industrial netting.    R. decided to join a softball team for the Pride tourneyment coming up this weekend... which suprised me a little because he isn't the most sporty of fellows.  If anything... he the most UNsporty of fellows.  Yet he joined and I am proud of him for doing it. Part of that pride I decided was to go with him to practice hitting balls in the aforementioned batting cage.    Well he was excited that I had offered to take him and as we pulled into the parking lot he started to get nervous.  I understood his nervousness but didn't feel it myself. He was worried about getting gay bashed.  Considering that these places aren't exactly a refuge for gay men, he was a little uneasy.  I joked with him and said "You really don't know how huge of a man I am do you?"  For those of you wondering, I am 6'4" tall and weight (TODAY) 326 lbs.  Refer to yesterdays post about my battle with that.  We walked in and promptly went to the counter and asked about the process.  It was simple really, give him money, we get tokens, and we put them in the carwashy type thingee, which in turn will allow us to hit 12 balls in a row.  Doesn't sound that complicated does it.  I think the scary part of it was the HITTING the balls part.    Now I was NOT the most athletic of children nor did I emerge in my teen years... to be quite honest... I am STILL WAITING for it to emerge. Or I was.  R. was up first.  I put a token in and pressed the button.  The machine at the other end of our section of the room started up and the arm scooped up a ball.  Waited... waited... FLING!  That ball was lobbed at R. with frightening speed. Please note.. it is IMPOSSIBLE for ANYTHING to be lobbed with speed.  R. swung and the ball tipped off the bat YAAAAAAA!!!!  and continued doing so with alot of self satisfication.  I went in after he was finished.. prepared to be humiliated... BUT NO!  I was connecting and nailing those f!ckers to the moon.. it was so gratifying...   and then.... R. started missing the ball... with one $1.50 token 12 balls were lobbed at him... and he swung at them all... and missed every single one of them...    My thing was... ok.. he is struggling... perhaps trying to help him would be good. WOW ... he got so mad when I suggested anything.  He started giving up and thinking everyone was watching him and judging him... i started to get uncomfortable but wondered what it was going to take.  So.. i kept buying tokens and gently encouraging him.  He is such a smart man I knew he could figure out what he was doing wrong.  He did.  It took up us 288 pitches in that cage but he did it.  He got it back and didn't give up. It was great. He was so elated.  Sigh.  we went back the next night and had as much more fun the next night... but holy snappin arseholes I was completely sore.

      Today... and I guess a little bit over the last few weeks I have been trying to figure out how to make change in my life.  I have been unsatisfied with my life in some major areas of it. Don't get me wrong... I have a great life.  There are just parts I would like to change and I figure I just CAN'T get enough baring of my soul so I created this with the help of the BLOG folks.  I will be coming on and posting pictures and diary entries for public displays of humiliation... also known as losing weight.  My body and I have been battling for 37 years now and it's winning.  Wanting to look all GQ or even remotely hot... would that be warm? Even LUKE warm would be nice.   So.  Here it goes.  I am going to have to convince someone to take some naked pics of me first...yes.. me ... in all my glory (excluding the naughty bits) (i think).    Keep me honest folks.  Don't let me get away with things.  I need some external eyes.

      Feeling scared and lost right now... trapped in my home right now.. its a thing that happens occasionally.&nbsp; Can't seem to get myself out. Laying on the chaise watching tv...&nbsp; Lost...&nbsp; I am going to meet a friend for dinner.&nbsp; I have arranged to meet with a few fellows from online.&nbsp; They are sweet guys.&nbsp; I am looking forward to meeting them but my self esteem is getting in the way.&nbsp; I feel like a fat schlub.&nbsp; I seem to always put myself last in things.
