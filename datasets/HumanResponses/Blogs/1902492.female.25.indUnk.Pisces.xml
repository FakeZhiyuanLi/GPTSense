       Today I scheduled my appointment for my D&C.  I will be going in at 4:15 p.m on Friday, October 3.  I have to be at the hospital at 2:15 p.m. and can't eat or drink after midnight on Thursday.  Friday will be a long day.  Setting the date for the end of my pregnancy was difficult.  After I got off the phone with the nurse I cried for a little while.  Today I didn't go to work.  I've been trying to take some time to reflect a little and honestly I'm nervous about going back to the office and facing everyone.  I'm sure that they will all be supportive, but I'm sure it will be hard.  Today I painted my memory box and I'm about to do the really hard part and write the letter to my baby.  I think it will help me heal.  The days keep going by and I think I'm coping well.  I've been surrounded by incredible love and support of family and friends.  It's extremely helpful.  Two friends I'd like to mention in particular are Tammy and Samara.   First of all Tammy, Tammy is an incredibly sweet, caring and compassionate woman that I'm fortunate enough to know because we work together.  She was blessed and pleasantly surprised earlier this year to find out that she was pregnant after going through a host of her own trials and sadness.  Her son will be born in November.  Tammy has been there for me from the time I decided to start her fitness program, to the time when Eric and I decided to start trying for a family, to the weeks of questions before I found out I was pregnant, to the day I told her I was pregnant, to the past two weeks of sadness and loss.  She's been a friend to listen and a shoulder to cry on.  She personally knows what I am going through and is a shining example of the joy that can be found after a loss.  I appreciate her every day and count myself lucky to have become her friend.  Secondly, is my best friend Samara.  I've known Samara since we met at a Christmas party almost 2 years ago.  We instantly clicked and have developed a deep friendship.  While Samara has not been through the same experience I am going through now, she has been beside me all the way and is there to listen when I need to share or offer advice or words of encouragement to try to keep my spirits lifted.  I spent the first evening after the news with Samara and her husband as Eric and I needed to get out of the house.  We have shared our secrets of the past and hopes for the future.  While this is something I never thought I'd have to deal with, she has been there to hold my hand.  My hope is that our friendship will last for a long time to come, if I am ever needed, I can be there to hold her hand too.

       I've been putting off writing this for a couple of days, but by now everyone that probably reads this page, knows what happened.    Friday morning was my doctor's visit.  Our appointment was at 10:00 a.m., but we ended up having to wait until about 10:45 a.m. before we got in because someone was in the room with the ultrasound.  When I finally got in, the nurse took all my vitals (weight, blood pressure, pulse) and then left me to strip down and wait for the doctor.  When Dr. DeAngelo came in she knew we were anxious, so she said, "Let's skip the chit-chat and get to this."  She started the ultrasound immediately.    As soon as we got a picture on the screen I immediately noticed that I still didn't see any movement.  Dr. DeAngelo started clicking on different areas to take the measurements.  Then she told us that there wasn't any change from last week.  Everything looked exactly the same.  Eric and I were both in tears because we knew what that meant.  She said that she had hoped it would turn out differently. I sat up and she told us that she would let me get dressed and give us a few minutes and then she would come back and we would talk about what happens next.  When she came back, she told us that first of all there was nothing that we did or didn't do or anything that we could have done differently.  Sometimes this just happens and we don't know why.  Maybe something wasn't developing right or there was some problem, but we probably won't every know why this happened.  She said the good news was that the chances of this happening again are very slim and I will probably go on to in the future have a normal healthy full term pregnancy and baby.  Miscarriages are very common and happen in 1 out of 5 pregnancies.  She will only get concerned if it happens 2 or 3 times in a row, then they would do tests and try to figure out the cause.  She also said that if we want to, we can try again as soon as I have one regular period.  So right now, I have 2 options.  The first is to just wait it out and let Mother Nature take it's course.  Eventually I will actually miscarry and it will be alot like a heavy period, with bad cramps and lots of bleeding.  If I go that route, she will want to continue to monitor my hormone levels to be sure that they decrease at the appropriate rate and she'll want to see me again in 2 weeks to be sure that everything is complete.  I asked how long it could take to start and she said it could happen anytime from immediately to another week or two.  I just need to decide if I want to wait.  The other option is a D&C.  In that scenario I would go into the hospital where they would put me under and Dr. DeAngelo would go in and scrape out the contents of my uterus.  This option carries the risks associated with surgery as well as a slight risk of uterine scarring.  She told me to go home and think about it and call the office on Monday to tell her what I want to do.  So then we left.  Eric and I both took the rest of the day off work and tried to figure out how to deal with this.  A lot of the feelings I've been having are a little too personal and raw to put here right now.  We have been surrounded by a lot of support.  We have received flowers from friends in both of our workplaces and from Eric's father.  My parents flew in from Iowa on Saturday to spend a day with me and show me there support.  We also went to dinner and a movie with our best friends.    For the most part I don't think I've had the major breakdown I was expecting.  I've been very sad and certainly had my share of tears, but I think the sadness and shock has been tempered by the fact that I had a little bit of an advance warning.  I've spent the last week, trying not to fear the worst, but knowing it was a possibility.  I also have not had to go through the physical loss of this baby yet.  So far, the loss is all emotional.  I'm sure there are difficult days to come.  I have found a way to deal with this in my own way.  I plan to put together a memory box as a sort of memorial to the loss of my first baby and pregnancy.  I plan to write down my feelings in a sort of letter to the baby and put in a box along with other momentos I have, including my pregnancy test, pictures from my parent's when I told them, pictures of the flowers people sent, my pregnancy planner, and probably a copy of this website.  When I feel the memorial is complete, I'll put it away.  Someday I can look back and remember this sad time in my life and hopefully reflect on the many blessings that came after.  I can share with my future children my love for this first baby that never came and always remember.

       Only 20 more hours until my doctor's appointment.  Regardless of what I said a couple days ago, I'm feeling pretty good about it.  I still have dark shadows of fear and anxiety creep in occasionally, but overall I think it's going to be ok.    A woman in my office is about 11 weeks pregnant and her doctor isn't going to do an ultrasound until the beginning of November.  I was thinking, although I was excited to get one early, I never would have been afraid if I hadn't had one.  No other symptoms make me think anything is wrong.  Every day that passes I feel more pregnant.  I notice that I'm more irritable lately.  I don't really think I act on it (although Eric might disagree), but I just feel whiny.  My other two constant feeling are tiredness and hunger.  I always want either a snack or a nap.  Snacking is easier.  My body is also changing.  Even my "fat" clothes are getting tight.  I feel ridiculous.  I put on these pants that used to be too big and they still are really baggy in the hips and thighs, but then they are tight on my waist.  I feel like a clown because even the bigger clothes don't look right.  I love the little belly though.  It's just rounder than before and I keep touching it.  It's definately different than being fat, but it's still not enough of a "pregnant" belly to wear the maternity clothes waiting patiently in my closet.  I may give in in a couple of weeks.  I resisted on the bra thing and then felt so much better when  I switched.  I'm sure this will be the same way.  I can't wait until tomorrow when I can move on from this last week of fear and get really excited about pregnancy again.  If it weren't for this week, I could say that I love being pregnant.  Maybe that can be next week's theme.

       The best $10 I ever spent.  The breast tenderness I've been having the past week or so has been agony.  I kind of thought I might be growing out of my bra, but it's been years since I changed sizes, so I guess I missed some of those signals.  Yesterday, I gave in and went to Wal-Mart and tried some on.  A bigger size is heaven.  I bought 2 for now, because I figure I'll just do a lot of laundry and I'm sure I'm not done growing.  This is the first non Victoria Secret bra I've purchased in quite a while, but I can't justify $30 for a bra when I may not be in it that long, and I'll probably go back to my old size afterwards.  For now, I'll just buy Hanes from Wal-Mart.  $9.96.  I feel so much better!

       Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. 3 more days or 69 more hours.  Why did I let Eric decide when we would go back to the doctor?  I'm sure I'll survive, but this is tougher than waiting to take the pregnancy test.  Then if I couldn't wait, I took the test it was negative and I wasted $10.  Now if I can't wait, I just have to wait some more.  I'm trying to stay positive.  I haven't cried at work since Friday.  I can tell people what's going on without seeming like I'm falling apart (I had to learn that one since I told EVERYONE when my first doctor appointment was).  Just in my head I can't get away.  I find it a little sad, but I've put all my happy thoughts on hold.  I'm not sharing nursery plans with Eric, I'm not planning when I should register at Babies R Us, I'm not thinking about whether I want my baby to be named Caleb or Grace (there are our names so far!), I'm just not thinking.  I'm trying not to get my hopes up in case of bad news.  How sad is that?  Sorry to bum anyone out, like I said I'm not falling apart on the outside.  I have a positive front, but inside I can't help but worry.  This is my outlet for those fears.  Ok, that's enough negative thoughts for today.    The baby is healthy and perfect.  The baby is healthy and perfect.  The baby is healthy and perfect.  The baby is healty and perfect.  Three more days.

       As you can tell, I'm not putting the week headings on until the doctor gives me a due date and I know where I stand.  This weekend's been pretty quiet and relaxing.  Friday night we invited some new neighbors that moved in about a week ago over for dinner.  They seem nice, but I had a horrible headache that Tylenol wasn't touching, so probably wasn't as great of a hostess as I normally would have been.  Saturday we just kind of hung out, but I did get some important things done like laundry and the bills.  Saturday night Eric and I watched a movie and stayed up until about 1 a.m.  Today has been all about relaxing and sleeping.  I slept until about 10:30 a.m. then got up and made some pancakes.  Then I was tired again, so took a nap about 12:30 p.m.  Oh, well.  I did manage to go to the grocery store today, and then have spent the rest of the day on the couch watching football with Eric.  On the baby front, I reread a section in the "What to Expect" book.  I remember thinking the first time I read it, that is seemed like a stupid question, but this time it brought me some comfort.  The question, "I'm very nervous because I can't really feel my baby.  Could it die without my knowing it?"  The answer, "At this stage, with no noticeable belly swelling andn no obvious fetal activity, it's hard to imagine that there's really a living, growing baby inside you.  But the death of a fetus or embryo that isn't expelled from the uterus in a miscarriage is   very  rare.  When it does happen, a woman eventually loses all signs of pregnancy, including breast tenderness and enlargement, and may develop a brownish discharge, though no actual bleeeding.  Upon examination, the practioner will find that the uterus has diminished in size."  So anyway, I definately still have pregnancy symptoms.  My breasts are still extremely tender and I think they are growing a little every day.  Today I even had my first obvious pregnancy mood swing (at least the first one I noticed :)  I was asking Eric if it was too early to take a nap (an hour and a half after I got up) because he sometimes teases me about my napping, and I started to cry.  Then I started laughing through my tears, because I knew that I was crying for pretty much no reason.  Eric looked terrified!  That seemed even funnier to me.  Last night while I was trying to go to sleep, I was thinking about the dates the doctor gave us for probably conception.  If she's right, which for obvious reasons I hope she is, I think there's a good chance we'll have a boy.  Supposedly, you are more likely to have a boy the closer intercourse is to ovulation, since the boy sperm swim faster and get to the egg first.  The girls, apparently are slower, but live longer, so if you do it a couple days before ovulation the chance for a girl goes up.  (Although, I think the chances are more like 51-52% instead of 50%, not a dramatic differance).  She said she thinks ovulation happened around August 9th.  We were together on August 4 (seems a little too far out to me), and the 9th and 10th.  Sorry Mom and Dad if you're reading, but I kept track in case the doctor wanted to try to figure out when conception happened.  I'm kind of glad I did right now.  Well, that's it for now.  I can't wait until Friday, to be sure everythings o.k.  I'm trusting and praying that the doctor is right and that my body is acting normal, because it is normal, but I won't be able to truely relax until we get to see it again.  Five more days.

       I'm feeling much better today than I did on Thursday.  I went back to work on Friday with a positive attitude and trying to believe that the only thing wrong was my timing.  A couple of people at work knew what had happened and they tried to make me cheer up.  They asked me if the doctor did an HCG Beta blood test.  The test measures hormone levels in your blood to make sure the pregnancy is viable and is progressing properly.  I knew they took a lot of blood, so I called the nurse to ask if they did the test and if so, could I get the results.  The nurse called me back and left a message saying that Dr. DeAngelo didn't see much value in the test once you can see something on ultrasound and so they had not ordered it.  She told me if I wanted it done, they could call the lab and ask them to do it, but I wouldn't know the results until Monday and would also have had to get blood drawn again on Saturday or Monday to compare the levels to.  We played a little phone tag, as I called and left another message for the nurse asking when they do find the test valuable and why exactly it wasn't a good test for me.  This time when she called me back we got to chat and she explained that they use the test early in pregnancy before you can see anything by ultrasound to make sure that the baby is growing and the pregnancy is progressing.  Once they can actually see the baby, however, ultrasound is a better tool.  They can see my baby, so she didn't order the test.  I accepted that and then reitterated my concern over how they count the weeks.  This time I got a much clearer response that when they measured me they were measuring weeks of fetal growth.  So when she said 6 weeks, she did mean from conception, so the dates she gave me for expected conception were accurate.  That means according to the pregnancy books, when you add on those 2 weeks at the beginning, I'm actually around the 8 week mark.  This is only 2 weeks off of what I thought.  That makes a whole lot more sense to me and makes me feel a whole lot better.  She again assured me that for that measurement the heartbeat thing was normal, and that everything else looked healthy and like it should.  Now I just need to wait until Friday and have it all confirmed by another ultrasound.

       Today was my first prenatal visit.  I've been looking forward to this visit since I scheduled it 4 weeks ago.  However, the actual experience wasn't as great as I had hoped it would be.  I've had a little time to reflect and think I'm handling things much better now, so I wanted to make sure I journaled this, so I wouldn't forget anything.  Eric and I got to the appointment 30 minutes early as requested and filled out the 1 form that wasn't sent in the package in the mail.  We then sat down and only had to wait about 5 or 10 minutes before they called me back.  Eric got to wait in an exam room while they took my weight, blood pressure, and a urine sample.  Apparently that will become a regular thing.  Then I went to the exam room and answered a couple of questions for the nurse.  Then the doctor came in and took my information about the date of my last period and told me that she was going to take a few cultures (in an internal exam), do an ultrasound to check my dates, and then take blood for all the other tests.  She asked us if we had questions for her yet, which we didn't.  I just thought I'd see what info we were given at the first visit and then start making lists later.  She said that the vitamin I've been taking is ok, but that she would give me some samples of prescription ones that I could take.  Then I got undressed and ready for my exam and they were doing a vaginal ultrasound. The exam went fine, and Eric stayed safely by my head.  When she started the ultrasound, it was cool that we could see this gray spot in the middle of this black sac of fluid.  I was of course looking for a heartbeat and was a little concerned that nothing seemed to be moving.  The doctor didn't say anything at first, and then said that what she was looking for was a heartbeat and she wasn't finding one.  Then she clicked on the spot to take some measurements and said that I was only measuring at about 6 weeks.  She finished up that ultrasound and went and looked at the calendar.  She said that at 6 weeks she thinks I conceived around August 9.  She also said that that timeline matches up well with when I got a postitive pregnancy test.  She could tell I was very concerned and said that if I was measuring at 9 weeks and she couldn't find a heartbeat that she would be concerned, but at 6 weeks it may just be to early to see it.  She decided to set me up for another appointment for an ultrasound next week to check and see if we have made progress and growth, and hopefully to see the heartbeat.    I'm a little confused about the dates.  Saying I conceived around August 9th (six weeks ago), to me would mean that I'm 8 weeks along, which would make sense to me, but she said that I measured 6 weeks, which (to me) would mean that I conceived around the 23rd, which is when I got a positive test and wouldn't be possible, so I'm a bit confused.  Thinking about it too much makes me worry, so I'm just going to go with the doctor, that I'm just off and everything is fine and pray that next week at the appointment we have sufficient growth and see that precious heartbeat.  Another positive note is that I haven't had any negative signs such as bleeding, spotting, or cramping.  The human body is an amazing thing and I have to believe that if there was a problem, my body would be taking care of it.  So, when I got home I was very upset and thinking  the worst.  After a discussion with a close friend at work by phone, I decided not to go  back to the office, as I would have been a mess and not very productive.  I called the nurse to ask about how the weeks were counted.  While her answer didn't really help, she did say she talked to the doctor and she said that the sac and everything else looked fine.  I also took another pregnancy test when I got home and felt a little reassured when it was still very positive.  On another note, I did remember to ask 2 questions at the doctor.  Number 1, I asked how frequently I get to have ultrasounds.  Not counting next week, she said that my next ultrasound will be at 32 weeks.  She doesn't do the early one at 20 weeks where you can tell the sex unless there is some problem or concern that she feels it's necessary.  I may try to talk her into doing one earlier, since my insurance will pay for it.  We'll see.  Number 2, she assured me that I am probably going to have a large baby.  She said that the baby's weight usually cooresponds to the mother's birth weight.  I weighed 9 pounds at birth and Eric weighed 9 pounds 13 ounces.  She said, "Sorry sweetie."  She did say that that would be an advantage to the 32 week ultrasound, because they could get an estimate of the baby's weight and know if it looks like it's heading for the large baby range.  Well, that's enough for now.  My next ultrasound is Friday next week.  I just have to try not to worry until then and say some prayers that next week it will be bigger and hopefully we'll get to see that heartbeat!

       It's been a busy weekend.  To start out, here's an update of the goings on during Week 9.    The Baby The baby is now officially a fetus!  Crown-to-rump length is .9 to 1.2 inches.  This is close to the size of a medium green olive.  The baby's arms and legs are longer.  Hands are flexed at the wrist and meet over the heart area.  The head is more erect and the neck is more devleoped.  Eyelids almost cover the eyes.  The baby nows moves its body and limbs.    My Body Each week your uterus grows larger with the baby growing inside it.  You may begin to see your waistline growing thicker by this time.  A pelvic exam will detect a uterus a little bigger than a grapefruit.  Mood swings are common now.  Complexion changes are common.  Either extra smooth skin or acne eruptions are both common.  As the uterus grows you may also feel a dull aching and cramping.  Personnally, I like hearing that my waistline could be thickening by now.  I definately notice a difference.  Other people looking at me wouldn't think that I'm pregnant, but I can see a new roundness to my lower abdomen.  I've unofficially gained 4 pounds.  What-to-Expect says to gain 3-4 pounds in your first trimester.  I'm guessing I'm going to gain more than that, since I'm already at 4 pounds with almost a month to go, and I don't have any problems keeping food down.  I'm not too concerned.  I've really changed my eating habits and guess that I would have probably gained 2 or 3 pounds without being pregnant.  Luckily I only notice weight gain in that lower ab area and it doesn't seem all soft and squishy like when you just get fat, so I'm ok with that.  On a new subject, Eric and I had a busy and fun weekend.  Donna (Eric's Mom) came to visit for the first time since we moved in to the house.  We went to dinner on Friday night and then rented a couple of movies.  Saturday we went to Aerobics class in the morning and then spent most of the rest of the day and evening shopping.  Then watched another movie.  It was a good visit.  Shopping, now that was an experience.  We went to lots of baby stores.  We showed Donna the crib and dresser/changing table we want to get.  I'm pretty sure we've made the decision.  We'll probably order it in early December.  It takes 10 weeks to come in.  I'd like to start on the nursery in February.  We also went to a couple of maternity stores and Babies-R-Us.  Eric was really cool and let me a get a couple of outfits.  I don't need them yet, maybe in a couple of weeks.  But, his rationalization was, I'm going to need the clothes, so why not spread out the shopping rather than having to buy a ton of stuff when I don't fit in any of my normal clothes any more.  I borrowed a lot of clothes from some women at work, but it's fun to have some stuff of my own too.  I bought a pair of jeans (I have a borrowed pair, but they are pretty small, and I'm guessing I'll outgrow them by month 5 or so.  I also got a great pair of black pants I can where to work and 2 really pretty shirts.  Then I got 2 stretchy short sleeve shirts that were on clearance and 2 tank top/camisole shirts.  We only spent about $125, so I thought that was pretty good.  Then we really went crazy.  We went to Best Buy, which is always a risky proposition.  We ended up buying a new computer including a monitor and printer.  The computer will be delivered in 2 weeks, and Donna bought us the printer with extra ink and photo paper as an early Christmas present.  We also got a digital camera.  I've been wanting a camera and with the pregnancy and baby, I can't think it's anything but a good investment.  Once I figure out how to do more of this posting stuff, I'll start posting belly pictures.  Well, that's probably a long enough post for now.  I'll give another update when I get some more info.  Thursday is the first doctor's appointment, so that will be fun.  If I figure out the posting, I'll take a picture of our ultrasound picture and post it.

       Before I start giving regular updates I thought I'd fill you in on common pregnancy symptoms and how I compare.   Delay of Menstruation - Occurs during entire pregnancy. - This one's kind of a no-brainer.  Yes I'm having this symptom, although some people also have light spotting, which fortunately I haven't.  Nausea and Vomitting - Appears 2 to 8 weeks after conception. - This is the one I was afraid of, but fortunately seems to have passed me by.  I'm one of the lucky few that may not have any morning sickness.  Morning sickness affects 50-80% of pregnant women.  It usually disappears after the first trimester, so even if I get it later, I'll probably only suffer for a couple of weeks.  Tender or Swollen Breasts - Appears 1 to 2 weeks after conception. - This is definitely one of mine.  It started with just nipple tenderness and then graduated to breast tenderness.  I've also been growing in that area.  Feeling Exhausted or Sleepy - Appears 1 to 6 weeks after conception. - This is probably the most pronounced (except maybe the breast changes) symptom I have.  I've been super tired and just wiped out.  I've been skipping the gym and going to bed early, things I rarely did before.  Backaches - During entire pregnancy - I haven't had this one yet, but I'm guessing as I gain more weight that could change.  Frequent Headaches - Sometimes during entire pregnancy. - I've had a couple of headaches, but nothing I would call frequent.  I'm so glad I had my sinus surgery first, because my migraines have decreased in frequency.  I've only had one since recovering from my surgery, so that's a success.  The other headaches I've had have been relatively minor and have responded to Tylenol.  Good thing because my Imitrex is not approved for pregnancy.  Food Cravings or Aversions - During entire pregnancy. - I haven't really had any cravings…at least nothing weird.  I do seem to always want sandwiches for lunch.  Like Einstein's Bagel sandwiches, or Subway or anything else.  Not burgers, but lunchmeat.  I do have a real life food aversion.  I can no longer eat chicken.  Actually, the only time I've had any nausea was when I smell, look at, or think about eating chicken.  The KFC commercial really disturbs me.  Darkening of Areola - 1 to 14 weeks after conception, then throughout pregnancy. - Haven't really noticed this, but it may be a subtle change.  Fetal Movements - 16-22 weeks after conception. - Still too early for this, but I'm looking forward to it!  Frequent Urination - 6 to 8 weeks after conception - This one should be kicking in soon.  Haven't really noticed it yet, but I spend a lot of time in the bathroom already, since I tend to drink a lot of water.  So, that's the symptom list.  Another frequently asked question is about diet and exercise.  I'm a little sad to say that this has changed radically for me.  As most people know I had been following the Body For Life (BFL) diet and exercise plan for the past 6 months or so.  On the plan I lost 9 pounds and 2 clothing sizes.  I was eating 6 small healthy meals daily and doing some time of exercise (either cardio or weight-lifting) 6 days a week.  Well, the first thing that started to slip was the exercise.  I'm blaming it on first-trimester fatigue, but I have been majorly neglecting the gym.  I need to limit/modify my cardio anyway, so I don't get my heartrate up too high, but I can barely force myself to stand and make dinner out of work, so a run on the treadmill is the last thing on my mind.  I did have the trainer at the gym set up a pregnancy friendly lifting workout for me though, so whenever I get a little energy back I plan to lift and do a little cardio on Monday, Thursday, and Saturdays.  I'm also going to try to keep going to the step aerobics class on Tuesday's cause it's so much fun.    As far as the diet goes, I'm still eating several times a day, just not the same foods.  Eric won't let me drink my protein shakes until I see the doctor and she ok's it, so that changed 2 of my meals.  Instead of an apple and shake on the way to work, I eat an apple and a granola bar.  My afternoon snack changed from an orange and a shake, to a bag of low-fat popcorn.  Our lunches and dinners have changed a bit too, since I won't make chicken now, we're eating a lot more beef and eating a lot more of the old, easy standby recipes that aren't BFL authorized like spaghetti and beef stroganoff.  I am trying to reach for healthier snacks.  After dinner when I should have cottage cheese and yogurt, I don't, but I do try to reach for apples or grapes, rather than loading the freezer with ice cream.  While I'm a little sad that I haven't done better, it's really hard to stay motivated to eat right, when the result is weight gain and a big belly rather than weight loss and 6-pack abs.  I've kind of decided to enjoy it now, and afterwards, when I need to lose the weight and get bikini ready again, BFL will once again be my friend.

       I have known I'm pregnant for 2 weeks and 5 days.  The time has flown by.  To start I think I should say that the fact I didn't find out I was pregnant until Week 6, still blows my mind.  This was a planned pregnancy.  Eric and I decided to start trying around the beginning of June.  By start trying I mean I quit taking the pill.  The first month didn't work, which wasn't a huge surprise, I mean I just quit birth control, plus while on the pill I had stopped having periods, so I knew I wasn't ovulating.  Anyway, that month was ok, because after a 35 day cylcle I had my first period in about 5 months.  So then the second month started and we tried to time ovulation according to a normal 28 day cycle.  So I was expecting a period or something around August 8th.  Now my first post-pill cycle came complete with a whole week of cramps and horrible PMS.  So anyway the week before I was expecting my period I had a bunch of "symptoms" (at least in my head).  I felt dizzy and lightheaded for a couple of days and then in the middle of the week my nipples became very tender.  I told a pregnant woman that I work with, and she swore I was pregnant, so I took a test 3 days before my expected period.  No surprise, it was negative.  So then I got a little pregnancy test crazy.  EPT must have loved me.  I tested again on day 27 and day 29 of my cycle.  Both negative.  So I decided to hold out until Friday, which would have been day 34 of my cylce.  I figured by then, even if I was on a longer cycle than 28 days it would be positive.  Still negative.  This time I gave up, even though I didn't have all the PMS symptoms like the previous month, I figured I was just still irregular from the pill and breasts had become tender, so I thought I would just wait for my period.  So I kind of forgot about it.  Another 5 days went by and then (it was Wednesday night) I noticed that my breasts seemed larger, I checked with my husband and he agreed, so on Thursday I bought another 3-pack of EPT tests. Friday morning I took ANOTHER test, and this one was finally positive.  6 weeks after the start of my last period.  That makes my due date (unless the doctor decides differently) April 17, 2004.  So that's my how I found out I'm pregnant story.

       So, I'm starting a Blog.  This is new territory for me.  I've never been much of a journaler, although I do tend to write long descriptive e-mails, so I think I'll be ok.  This is also a great time in my life to write everything down, so here goes.  This is my first pregnancy.  I hope that by recording what's happening here, my friends and family can get a glimpse into what I'm thinking and feeling on a regular basis.  I'm not going to promise posting with any kind of frequency, but I'll do my best.  That's it for this post.  I'll write again shortly and begin my pregnancy story.

       I got to go see the baby at lunch today.  He was so cute. I took pictures, but since he's not my baby, I probably shouldn't post them.  Jonathan Dillon was born last night at 9:42 p.m. weighing in at 8lbs. 7 oz. and 22 inches long.  Everyone is doing great and they are sooo happy.  Congrats Tammy!

       Unfortunately we haven't gotten much of an update here at the office, but we do know that Tammy's in labor.  Yesterday at the doctor they stripped her membranes (sounds like fun).  This morning she woke up and was leaking amniotic fluid.  She called her doctor and went to the office.  When he went to do the internal exam, her water broke.  Then she called on her way to the hospital and wasn't having contractions yet.  I was considering going to the hospital tonight to see her, but probably won't if we don't hear that the baby is born before 5:00 p.m.  I will go tomorrow though, either during lunch or after work.  I'm so excited!  I'll provide the details tomorrow.

       I can't believe how time flies.  I have the intention of updating frequently, but I've been pretty busy.  Work is keeping me extremely busy, but it's good.  The only downside is that I don't have as much time to do miscellaneous personal things at work, but I suppose that isn't the point of going to work anyway.  I've been planning away for our next GWO, which I get to host.  I've already added about 1/2 a day to the festivities by asking the girls to come in the night before.  I've got meals planned and some shopping ideas.  Now I just have to put together the info pack to send out.  To the baby topic.  My friend Tammy at work found out today that she's being induced on Monday if she doesn't go on her own before that.  I'm still hoping she has a Halloween baby, but we'll see.  She's officially at 38 weeks, but is measuring at 40 weeks, so it could be anytime.  I made plans to go with another coworker to see her Monday night after work.  I'm so excited for her.  My other friend Kim went to have her first ultrasound at a high-risk specialist today.  I'm waiting for her call to see how it went.  She's at 14 weeks and says she's feeling flutters.  Sigh...I hope I'm pregnant again before she delivers in April.  It's a little hard sometimes to see her when I know she's only a week off of where I was supposed to be.  On that note, I'm hoping we can start trying again soon.  I'm pretty sure I've been having some PMS symptoms this week.  Either that or everyone around me has suddenly become a whole lot more annoying.  This morning I asked Eric if he thought I'd been moody this week, and he answered "Yes" without hesitation.  Then I snapped, "You could have thought about it!"  I guess that answers my question.  I'm not sure about other symptoms.  I suppose anytime is fine with me.    One good note, I've been good for going on 3 days now with diet and exercise.  I just wish I cared a little more.  I think I have a one track mind.  If I wasn't into the baby thing right now, I could go full force at the diet thing, but now I just know I want to have a baby and forget about the diet.  I know it's better for me to lose some now though.  I'd like the pre-pregnancy weight to be as low as possible.  That's all for now.  Hopefully something interesting will happen soon and I can write about that.

       Finally, a decent doctor's appointment.  I had my follow-up appointment today after 3 weeks.  When the doctor came in to see me, she asked how I was and I got a little teary and said fine, until I got here.  She must think I'm a nut since I break into tears every time I see her.  She asked if I had any questions and I did.  Number 1, I have a friend that is sure that my miscarriage had something to do with getting pregnant quickly after quitting the pill.  Everything I've read suggests that the only reason some doctors have you wait a couple of months is to get your cycles on track so you know when you conceived and what your due date is.  She agreed that there is no reason to wait.  There is no evidence that the pill increases your chance of miscarriage.  The only thing that increases after the pill is the incidence of twins (watch out Erica!).  So then I asked her about trying again.  She said I just had to wait 1 period, but I asked what the advantages of waiting longer would be.  I don't want to rush into something just because I want it if it would be better to wait longer.  Her answer, the only reason to wait longer is if you aren't ready mentally or emotionally.  Physically, there is no reason to wait.  When my body's ready I can get pregnant again.  She then checked to make sure my uterus has went back to it's prepregnancy size.  She said that all the pathology came back normal from my D&C.  I asked what they looked for in the pathology.  She said that you sometimes can have a  urlLink Molar Pregnancy . If that were the case, I couldn't get pregnant for 6 months to a year, but that wasn't the case with me and everything was fine.  Finishing up the visit, she told me that I should get a period within a 4-6 week time period (it's already been 3!) and then can try again.  If nothing happens I'll go back in April for my annual, but hopefully I'll be in before that for another pregnancy.    I think this is all good news, because although, I've lost my baby.  Nothing I did caused it, I can try again soon, and nothing major was wrong with the fetal tissue.  It was just a fluke of nature and I probably won't have any more problems!  Yay!  Now if my period would just start next week....

       I just read my friend's blogs and feel I'm a little behind on posting.  I just love getting the updates.  Hopefully, I have some readers too that don't think I'm just rambling.  Been a pretty good week.  Yesterday I spent all day at my employers both at the OSU Career Fair.  It was pretty cool, but a little overwhelming to know that with a check mark in the wrong box, a kid I talked to would never even get his resume looked at.  Wow!  I can't believe I managed to land such a great job.  Just read Erica's blog and she's in the "trying" week.  I have a feeling this is her month.  I wish it were mine too.  I also have a feeling that I'll only have to try once this time.  Speaking of feelings, I kind of think I'll only have to wait another week or two for AF (Aunt Flow, for future reference).  Don't know what it is.  I just love every idea about being pregnant and can't wait to do it again.  Of course I'm a little scared that next time I'll be hit with unbearable morning sickness, but...it'll be worth it if all goes well.  Today I had to give back some of the maternity clothes I borrowed.  The coworker that lent them to me has another friend that needs some now, but she's due in February, so I could still get them back before I need them.  Assuming I get pregnant sometime in November, I probably won't need clothes until about March, so that's ok.  It wasn't even that weird to pack them up and give them back.    Ok enough for now.  Tommorrow I have my follow up doctor's appointment, so I'll write more then.

       Had a really great weekend.  It was our 2nd official GWO (Girl's Weekend Out).  We spent most of it shopping, of course, but the best part was just visiting.  It really lifts my spirits to be with my girls.  One cool thing that happened was that we stopped by this booth at the Covered Bridge Festival and bought these necklaces that show the phase of the moon on the day you were born.  The sales person, Ava Chu, was really cool.  She wasn't selling psychic services, but she seemed to have a little bit of an intuition.  All we told her was that three of us were married and didn't have any kids.  She looked right at me and said, "You are having a girl."  Then she told Erica that she was having a boy, and told Danialle she was going to wait a while.  Then she told Heather that she would find someone soon.  That she would be in a serious relationship between Christmas and Valentine's Day.  It was kind of cool.  Who knows, but Erica and I want kids soon, Danialle is waiting, and Heather isn't dating anyone seriously right now.  I really did restart my diet yesterday.  One day of no cheating, drinking my 5 bottles of water, and I went to the gym for the first time since Labor Day.  I just did 20 minutes of cardio on the treadmill, but I ran 1.6 miles, so that's not too shabby.  Today, I plan on doing upper body.  I probably won't be able to lift my arms tomorrow.  Another good thing.  The other woman in my office that got pregnant about the same time I did finally had her first doctor's appointment yesterday.  All good news.  They heard the heartbeat immediately and estimate her at about 13 weeks, which is where she thought she was.    So far, so good.  She was really nervous because she's had problems in previous pregnancies, but this one's doing good.    The baby making for me hasn't changed much.  I am ready whenever, but have to wait for my body to catch up.  Eric has come around and agreed that we can try again after I have a period.  So just waiting on that.  I'm hoping it happens sometime next week.  I have a doctor's appointment on Friday (3weeks), so I don't want it to happen before then, since I may have to get an internal exam.  And Eric and I are going away for the weekend on November 7, so I don't want it to happen then.  I hope it's come and gone before my weekend getaway, but we'll see.

       Did I say I was starting a diet?  That went really well up until about 5:00 pl.m. on Monday night.  I've been busy at work and I missed one of my snacks, so I was starving and wanted chocolate.  I also had a headache, so I went to Kroger to pick up my perscription and also picked up a Kit Kat and a frozen pizza for dinner.  Anyway, we ate pizza for dinner, so there wasn't a healthy lunch prepared for Tuesday...  I think it's hard to be motivated when I hope to get pregnant again pretty quickly.  I can't do the 12-week program, because if all goes as planned I'll be pregnant by then and then won't be meeting those goals.  Another lack of motivation this week is my Girl's Weekend starting tomorrow.  It will be a weekend full of fun, laughter, tears, and of course bad food.  Maybe next Monday...  Girl's weekend should be promising.  I think I need this time with good friends.  On a positive note, now that I'm not pregnant and my other friend that is "trying" didn't succeed this month, we can enjoy the hot tub this weekend.  There's always an upside.  Don't get me wrong, I would trade the weekend in the hot tub for my baby in a heartbeat, but...we take what we can get.  Overall, it's been a good week.  I've only had to cry once, last night.  I was telling Eric about my pregnant friend Tammy's great doctor's visit and ultrasound and started crying.  It just made me sad because I really wanted the good doctor's visit and ultrasound.  That bugs me sometimes, I never even had one "good" visit to the doctor.  Next time.  On the other hand, my sadness had nothing to do with my feelings about her pregnancy, it was just a reminder of mine.  She's doing so great and I'm so happy for her and excited about the baby.  The baby could be here in as little as 2 weeks!  That's it for now, I'll check in after the GWO (Girl's Weekend Out).

       I'm calling that the title because this is a new week.  It's Monday and today I'm restarting the diet.  My goal, lose 10 pounds by Thanksgiving.  That will get me back to my ending BFL weight.  It's a little disgusting to me that I've gained that much, but at least I know how to lose it.  I've got 6 1/2 weeks to do it.  I know I'll be having more than 1 cheat day this week because I've got my Girl's Weekend Out (GWO) this weekend, but overall I think I can do it.  So far I'm on track, I had my protein shake and apple for breakfast, packed my days worth of authorized food and even packed my gym bag for after work.  That will be tough, I haven't been to the gym since August 28.  (Maybe that's why I gained 10 pounds?)  Anyway, I'm looking forward to looking good by the holidays again, although looking good isn't as obvious in the winter, when we're in sweaters and stuff than the summer when you get to wear cute tank tops that show off the toned arms and shoulders, but at least I'll feel good.  Maybe by Thanksgiving we'll be trying again, or I could possibly be in the very early stages of pregnancy.  I finally (cross your fingers) have stopped bleeding, nothing since early Saturday morning.  I'm starting to feel human again.  I'm guessing I could get a real period in as little as 3 weeks, but I don't really think I'm a hurry, I've had enough bleeding over the last 2 weeks to last a while.  Eric is also interested in waiting maybe two months to try.  We'll discuss it after the first month.  He wants me to be on track, just to be safe.  The doctor said one month was all I needed though, so we'll have to discuss some more.  Maybe we'll try in a month if it looks like I'm close to the Thanksgiving goal, but if not, I'll give myself another month to get there.  Either way, it'll be ok.  Well, I'm officially supposed to be at work now, so I guess I should get to work.  Later.

       I've been back to work for almost a full week now.  It's been going pretty good.  On Monday, I had several people approach me in the perfect way.  They just stopped by and said that they heard what happened and were sorry.  That's perfect, don't stop to chat, don't ask for all the details, don't make us remarks to make me "feel better", don't tell me stories about your friend that had 3 miscarriages and then got pregnant again.  Just say your sorry.  That's perfect.  I only want to "discuss" with people I am close too.  Physically this recovery has been tougher than I expected.  I had hardly any bleeding on Saturday and Sunday and then started bleeding more on Monday and Tuesday.  It got worse and I was passing clots by Wednesday.  The nurse said it's normal and only to get concerned if I start soaking a pad an hour, passing clots the size of lemons, or run a fever.  None of those things are happening, so I guess I'm o.k.  Yesterday I had to take Percocet as soon as I got home from work because my cramps were so bad, but today I'm barely bleeding.  Interesting.  On another note, I'm restarting my diet on Monday.  We've been eating the rest of the "bad" food in the house and plan to get back to the gym and our previous eating habits next week.  I didn't mind gaining weight when I was going to have a baby, but now I'd like to lose 5 or 10 pounds before I get pregnant again.  Eric and I have scheduled a trip for the weekend of November 7-9 at   urlLink Ravenwood Castle   It should be so cool.  We are staying in the Woodcutter Cottage.  I'm looking forward to the get away.  I'm hoping we can just relax and enjoy ourselves.

       I'm finally adding the story of my D&C on Friday.  Here goes.  I stayed up really late (like 1:30 a.m.) Thursday night so I could get as much snacking and water drinking as possible in since I wasn't allowed to have anything to eat or drink after midnight for my surgery.  I also thought the later I stayed up, the later I would sleep.  Again, less hours to be hungry and thirsty.  Friday morning I slept in until about 11:00 a.m.  My appointment was scheduled for 4:15 p.m., but they told me to be at the hospital at 2:15 p.m.  So after getting up and showering I settled in to play some games on the computer.  Honestly, I didn't even really think about what was going on until we got in the car and were on our way.  Eric took the afternoon off, so he came home a little after noon.  Came home with take out from McDonald's I might add, wasn't really helpful for my no food rule.  We left the house at about 1:50 p.m.  I cried a little in the car, but Eric held my hand and it was o.k.  When we went in to register I was again a little weepy.  It may sound stupid, but one of my major concerns about the surgery was that when I went in, people at the hospital would think I "wanted" the procedure, i.e. that I was having an abortion.  Later, my Mom and another friend confirmed that they don't even do elective abortions at hospitals, so no one would asume that anyway.  Anyway, when they gave me the paperwork to register, I noticed that the diagnosis listed on my chart was a D&C for a Missed Abortion.  Abortion is just the word the doctor's use for a miscarriage.  Usually it's called a Spontaneous Abortion.  A "Missed" Abortion is when the embryo or fetus dies, but is not expelled from the body for at least 2 weeks.  That pretty much describes it for me.  Anyway the diagnosis was on my chart, so while seeing it in print made me cry, I did feel better.  We sat in the waiting room for a few minutes before they came to get me to go up to the pre-op area.  Eric was allowed to go with me.  They put me in a room and gave me a bag for my belongings and a robe to wear.  I was to take everything off and put the robe on.  I was a little concerned because I'd been having some light bleeding and didn't really want to be "completely" naked.  They gave me some hospital panties (kind of like gauze with 3 holes in it and a huge hospital size maxi pad.  So I got into the hospital gear and onto the bed and waited for my nurse.  She was very cheerful, but a little weird.  She was quite chatty and was the one to put in my IV.  She knew what was going on though, because at one point she mentioned that she wished I didn't have to be there.  On an upside, I forgot to take off my wedding ring, so they let me keep it on and just wrapped it with surgical tape.  Eric and I watched some trashy people find lost loves on the Montel Williams show and waited.  At one point my doctor popped in to see me.  I really like her.  She is all business and to the point, but at the same time makes me think that she cares about me.  She asked how we were doing and if we were ready to get this over with and start to move on.  Of course, while crying we said yes.  She said she had one other case before me, but thought she'd probably get me in a little early.  My anesthesiolgist. (I need to check the spelling on that), stopped by to explain how they would put me out.  I got a little concerned, because he said they weren't doing general anesthesia.  Instead they did something called "Twighlight" something.  I was still completely unaware of what was going on, but I wasn't as deeply under, so I woke up easier and didn't need a breathing tube down my throat.    So finally they came to take me to surgery.  That's when Eric had to go down to the waiting room.  Right before I went into the room, a nurse came out and asked me what Dr. DeAngelo was doing for me.  That was the only time I had to say why I was there.  Of course, that made me cry again.  So I went in and they had me switch from the bed to the table.  While I was moving over, people started untying my gown and getting everything situated.  I started to mention the little panty things, but they just said that's fine and put the arm rests on the table.  There were probably about 5 people in the room and there was some music playing.  I reconized my doctor and a nurse that had came to see me earlier.  Once I was kind of situated they knocked me out.  I didn't even have to count backwards.  I didn't have to put my legs up or help them get the panty things off or anything.    When I woke up I was really emotional and crying.  I was in the post-op recovery area.  I remember trying to talk to the nurse that was with me and told her how much I wanted my baby.  I don't remember what she said, but I'm sure it was comforting.  Then I had a different younger nurse and I talked to her a little.  She told me that she was pregnant and due in May and I remember how sad I thought it would be working there and seeing people like me so often.  I woke up pretty quickly.  The nurse checked to see how much I was bleeding and then sent me over to the discharge area.    The nurses brought me my clothes and let me get dressed while they went to get Eric.  I managed to get dressed and then Eric showed up.  They sat us down and went over the discharge instructions.  I got 2 prescriptions, one for Percocet for pain and 1 for bleeding to take for 2 days.  I was allowed to go back to normal activities after 24 hours, except a limitation of no baths for 7 days.  Eric went to get the car and the nurse got me a Coke and some graham crackers and wheeled me in the wheelchair down to the car.  We went to the store to get my prescriptions filled and get some junk food and then went home.  I recovered pretty quickly over the weekend although I've been having more bleeding and cramping over the past day or so.  I called and the nurse said that's pretty normal, but to keep an eye on it.

       I changed the title of my Blog today.  I've decided to keep using it even though all of this happened.  Hopefully, I'll have much more to share and any of my experiences can help others.  I've taken the whole week off of work.  I went into the office Tuesday, but left after about an hour.  Turns out it was harder than I thought it would be and my coworkers and even my superiors think I should take some more time and come back when I'm ready.   Tommorrow is my D&C.  I think I'm ready.  I've been having some bleeding over the past few days, but not enough to make me think I'm close to be done if I were to do this the natural way.    I think I'm healing slowly.  I even had a short lived flash of anger yesterday.  My brother-in-law called for the first time and Eric talked to him.  Eric was saying that we're doing better and looking to the future, etc.  And within minutes they were discussing baseball.  I was thinking it's not "fine" we aren't "doing good."  Then I realized that I hadn't wanted to talk and it's different for Eric.  We are doing ok, and nothing he could say to us would change anything, so I should let him deal with it in his way.  While Eric's sad too, it will never be the same type of loss for him.  I'll write more about my procedure and how I'm feeling this weekend.

       It's been a whole week since I blogged.  Sorry for the delay.  It's been a busy week.  I spent Monday, Tuesday, and until about 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday being super busy.  We managed to get everything wrapped up though, and then I have been off work the rest of the week.    Wednesday, Eric, Zeus, and I drove over to Terre Haute, Indiana to Eric's Dad's house.  We got in about 9:45 p.m. and spent a couple of hours visiting.  Then Thursday morning we got up and visited some more.  Eric's brother and family ended up coming over to his Dad's too, so we got to see them.  We don't see them a whole lot and Eric is really close to his brother, so it was really nice to see them.  Also, I got to spend some time with my niece Logan.  She's about 5 months old now, and so cute.  The last time I saw her she was just 10 days old.  Holding her and playing with her was so great, I can't wait until I have my own.  We left his Dad's at about 4:30 p.m. and made it home before 9:00 p.m.  Eric had to work on Friday, so we had to come back.  Friday, Eric got up for work, and I got up for shopping.  I hit the stores at about 8:30 a.m. and didn't get home until 5:30 p.m.  I got most of my shopping done.  I still need to finish up for Eric, but everybody else is pretty much done.  Eric and I met for lunch on Friday.  I also spent 1 hour and 45 minutes in line at Best Buy, which was totally crazy.  Shopping the day after is good because of the deals, but it can be totally crazy.  I went by myself, which is cool because there's no one else to keep track of, but it would have been nice to have someone to talk to in the Best Buy line besides the angry shopper behind me.  Saturday I just tried to chill.  Eric worked from 8 to 1.  I slept until about 10:00 then got up and did some Christmas decorating.  I got the tree up and all the inside done.  We put up some outside lights today.  I remembered why I like to decorate without Eric here.  I got everything pretty much put up before he got home, and was taking some boxes back to the basement.  Eric was standing in the living room where I put the tree and asked if I wanted to help him move some furniture around so the "design" would look better.  I gave him a look, like "are you serious".  After all, I spent the whole morning dragging boxes from the basement, moving furniture, and putting up the tree and decorations, and he didn't like where I put the chair.  Moving the furniture would have required moving the now decorated tree, so he agree that he could live with the furniture placement for a month, and that was settled.  Sunday has been really laid back.  Eric and I got to sleep in together which was very nice.  Sometimes I think that's why I haven't been going to church much here.  Eric works at least half of all the Saturday's every month, and I just love days where we can sleep in together.  Anyway, after we got up we put up the outside decorations, then we decided to go to BW3's so Eric could watch the Colts game.  After a quarter, they were losing and Eric decided we could leave, since we had to go get a couple extension cords and another light set to finish up outside.  Now that it gets dark at 5:00 p.m. it limits our time to do outside stuff.  We went to the grocery store and then went home and finished up lights.  Then I wrapped all the gifts I bought and am just blogging.  So that's what's happened in the last week.  For those who read for the baby updates, not much news yet.  I found a cool website that lets you do free BBT charting called  urlLink Fertility Friend .  It's kind of cool.  I'm on Cycle Day 28, 9 days post ovulation.  I'm glad I charted or this is when I would have started taking the pregnancy tests.  Now I am waiting another week.  Speaking of pregnancy tests, I went ahead and picked up some for next weekend.  I bought the ClearBlue Easy Digital tests.  They have a read-out that says "Pregnant" or "Not Pregnant", they were 3 for 14.95 at Wal-Mart.  EPT was 2 for $14.95.  After getting home I opened them and read a little.  While the digital thing is cool, the read out disappears after an hour.  That means you can't save a positive.  So, I guess if I'm pregnant, I'll go buy another one and save the one with the two lines.  I kind of like being able to keep your positive test.  The other thing is that I wasn't sure how sensitive the digital's were.  EPT detects at 40 mIUs and ClearBlue at 50 mIU, so it probably won't detect as early either, but digital is cool.  Here's the  urlLink website  to compare pregnancy tests.  So anyway, I have one more week to wait to test.  I'm not sure how I feel yet.  My temps aren't giving me any clear signs, I have felt tired recently, not really nauseous, no real food things, except I have been hungry, no breast changes, I seem to have broken out more lately, no mood changes.  So it could be something or nothing.  I guess I just have to wait.    Ok, I'm going to go hang out on the couch until bed time.  Later!

       I thought I'd maybe write about something other than my reproductive cycle for once.  So here's my weekend.  It was actually very relaxing and laid back, a perfect weekend.  On Friday night I did some housework.  I got caught up on the laundry and cleaned the downstairs because we were having people over on Saturday.  Eric and I even steam cleaned the floors and they look tons better.  Then Saturday we had some friends over to watch the OSU vs. Michigan game.  It was a good time, I ordered 50 wings from BW3's, made my hamburger/cheese dip for chips, and invited 2 couples over.  OSU lost the game which is disappointing because everyone in this town is so crazy over OSU, but we still had fun.  Then we spent the evening with our neighbors/friends and had pizza and watched finding Nemo at their place.  We see them every Thursday when we watch TV together, but it was nice to hang out and actually get to talk about something other than who we want to see voted off Survivor next.  Sunday we slept in a bit and then Eric went to watch the Colts play on TV at BW3's with Martin.  I stayed home played on the computer some and went to the grocery store.  Then I spent most of the evening making 8 dozen yeast rolls.  I tested one, and was disappointed when they weren't as good as my Mom's.  I froze them and will be taking them to Thanksgiving at Eric's Dad's house.  I also had a nice chat with my Mom.  I'm a little sad that we won't be seeing my parent's at Thanksgiving this year.  This will be my first Thanksgiving away from my family.  It will be different, but I suppose Eric and his Dad are my family now too, so this is just a different way to share the holiday.    Also talking to Mom, she mentioned that Grandma reads my Blog, so I just want to say I hope I haven't embarrassed her.  I know that this is a public site and that I gave my family the address, so I usually write with that in mind, but it seems a little weird that Grandma knows as much about my "sex life" as my friends.  Then again, while it's not something I would probably discuss in person with her, this is what I'm feeling and this website truely reflects who I am.  I'm not ashamed of anything I've written here, so I'm glad we can connect in this way.  If you're reading Grandma, I love you and am glad you care enough about my life to check in.  I'll give you a big hug at Christmas.  I think I'm ready for next week.  I've got so much going on at work, that I'll be super busy every day.  I may even be working late Monday and Tuesday.  Then I'll have stuff to do at home.  I need to make cookies on Tuesday night to take with us.  Then probably do a couple of loads of laundry and pack.  We'll leave on Wednesday when Eric gets home from work.  I'd also like to organize my Christmas shopping list and knock most of that out when Eric's working on Friday and Saturday.  I also will be decorating for Christmas and probably doing some Christmas crafts for presents for people at work.  I also wanted to work on my GWO scrapbook.  Sounds like I need more than a long weekend, but it'll be fun.  I also don't mind staying busy, so the next two weeks will go by quickly.  Well that's it for now.  I'll try to update again before Thanksgiving if anything interesting happens.

       I've officially ovulated.  Not really sure how I feel about it.  According to my temps, it probably happened on Friday.  We really should have been together on Thursday and then I'd feel like we have a really good shot.  For those keeping track, I ovulated on Day 19, which gives me a 33 day cycle and expected period on December 6th.  I may try to wait until the 7th to test unless I have symptoms, because by missing Thursday, I'm guessing there's a chance we missed the window.  I can't really find much information on how long sperm actually live, so I don't know if being together on Tuesday night and Friday night will work if I ovulated some time on Friday.  I guess we wait 12 more days to see.  I think that will actually go by pretty fast.  There's nothing really to do now but wait and we have Thanksgiving week in there which will probably fly by.  Wish me luck.  How crazy is it that I started my period 4 days before Erica, but will have to wait a day longer than her to find out if my month worked?  I wish her luck too.  I read somewhere that for a normal healthy couple there's a 25% chance in any one month of getting pregnant.  To me that means by Month 4 you should be close!

       Ok, so now I'm getting a little tired of this.  Still no significant increase.  My biggest fear is that it will happen today and Eric and I haven't been together since Tuesday.  I guess we'll make sure we are today, so there's a chance that we could time it right.  Last night we were just so tired.  I'll be really upset if skipping that day screws up our chances this month.  While I'm getting frustrated that I don't think I've ovulated yet, I'm clinging to the fact that my first period post pill was 35 days and then probably close to that for the month I got pregnant (since I had to wait so long for a positive test.)  Looks like Erica and I will be finding out at about the same time in December.  I wish I was a 28 day cycle.  Sigh...  Ovulation today will give me a 33 day cycle with a period expected on December 6th.  That just seems like a long time to wait.

       This morning's temp was weird.  It's still not the .2 jump over the last 6 days.  (See  urlLink Drawing Coverline  ).  But it did jump .3 from yesterday.  We were together last night, so if ovulation was yesterday or today it'll be cool.  So now I'm looking at a 31 day cycle.  This makes me realize how I could have not had a positive test until 6 weeks last time.  I'm a late ovulator.  I wish I could figure out how to post my chart, so other people could take a look.  It's an excel spreadsheet, so if you've got any ideas, please e-mail me.

       Still no spike.  I think I was just getting a little anxious, I'm usually longer than a 29 day cycle too, I'm usually around 30 to 32 days, however, my first cycle off the pill was 35 days, and then I got pregnant, so it's hard to know for sure.  Anyway, ovulation today would put me at 30 days, so we're getting closer, but it still could be a couple of days.  I just have to be sure not to quit trying yet.  Weekends are easier, but I'll have to make sure to stay on top of it.  No pun intended. :)  Another good note, work is keeping me busy, so I don't really have time to sit around and obsess about it.  That may change after ovulation when I have to just wait the 2 weeks out.  I also want to say "Good Luck" to Erica.  We're on almost the same cycle, but hers is shorter, so she should be ovulating in the next couple of days too.  I'm just hoping this is our month.  We'll just have to wait and see.

       I have not ovulated yet.  I'm kind of glad because we've been doing a good job on "trying" so I feel like anytime I ovulate, we're in good shape.  My temp dropped this morning back to 97.6, my all time low (except the one day at the cabin), maybe this is the dip before my spike?  Anyway, we've been together for 7 of the last 14 days so I feel like I'm in good shape if I ovulate soon.  I've decided I like charting.  I won't start looking for my period until 14 days post ovulation, so right now I'm expecting at least a 29 day cycle (if temps spike tomorrow).  That would mean December 3rd would be the earliest I'd test.

       It's been a good weekend, although I don't think I'm ready to go back to work.  Friday night was kind of dull, since I spent all night studying for my first CPCU exam (Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter).  I procrastinated and hadn't read the texts and my essay exam was on Saturday morning.   This exam was on the Foundations or Risk Management and Insurance though, so I figured I knew most of the material, since that is my job and I've already completed my ARM designation (Associate in Risk Management), but I spent Friday night cramming.  Saturday I got up went to take the test.  I think I did pretty good, although I have to wait 6 weeks for them to grade it and send me my scores.  That was a relief to finish.  I think I've been stressed about the test because I keep doing other things when I should have been studying, and now I don't have to feel guilty about doing other things.  Saturday afternoon I went shopping with Samara.  I didn't buy much, but it was nice to catch up and spend some time with her.  We've both had stuff going on and haven't seen each other in about a month, although we do talk on the phone a couple times a week.  Saturday night, our husbands caught up with us and we went to BW3's for wings and then to the movies to see Elf.  It was cute and turned out to be a nice evening.  Sunday has been really laid back.  I slept in and then have just done laundry, I even ironed my sheets!  I also paid some bills and updated my excel budget spreadsheet.  Then I've been doing some thinking about Christmas.  I really need to figure out what I'm getting people and start shopping soon.  I have some ideas, but won't share here since I'm not sure and may be doing some gifts for people reading this board.    As far as the baby subject goes, I'm really pretty focused right now.  I did some more reading on the  urlLink Cervical Mucus and  urlLink Cervical Position  stuff your supposed to do in conjunction with BBT to help predict ovulation.  While I haven't been checking and charting this month, I have started paying attention to the mucus lately.  Today especially there's seem to be a whole lot of it.  Yesterday I tried to check my cervical position for the first time.  I found it, but with nothing to compare it to, I'm not sure what it means. It was kind of cool though, because I could feel the slit where the opening is.  Maybe next month I'll chart that stuff too (if this month is unsuccessful, that is).  I still haven't had my temperature spike.  I thought it was going to this morning, as Saturday I hit 98.0, the highest yet.  Then this morning it was 97.7, so not really a jump.  I think for me to know it spiked, I'll have to hit 98.2 at least.  Well, I'll write tomorrow if my temp spikes, but that's it for now.

       I just stole Erica's sidebar 'cause I think it's a great idea.  Abbreviations mean:  LMP - Last Menstrual Period, EDO-Estimated Date of Ovulation, ENP-Estimated Next Period, DOC-Days in Cycle.  The only one I'm sure of is LMP.  Estimated date of ovulation is based on a 28 day cycle.  The next period is based on 31 days, and 31 days is based on how long it took me to get a period after my D&C.  My cycles have always been regular, but a little longer than the 28 day average.  I'm guessing 30 to 31 days.  So, it's a little difficult to know when I'm "late".  Good for the HPT industry.

       I started a similar post about 2 days ago and then my computer just turned off in the middle of it.  Maybe it's good that that post didn't get published because it had a lot of kind of sad feelings about babies, pregnancy etc.  Speaking of babies, I may get to go see Jonathan again today.  That will be cool.  I wonder how much bigger his now.  He's 2 weeks old.  I'm still working diligently towards my goal of Motherhood.  I'm sad to say that last night we were together for the sole purpose of trying to conceive.  Neither one of us was in the mood, but we are trying to be together every 2 to 3 days and it was on day 3.  Although, without giving too many details, (I know Mom reads this), we were ok with the decision by the time we were done. :)    I don't really know why, but I think I've very close to ovulation point.  That really doesn't make since to me, since I usually have a little longer than 28 day cycle, I would think I ovulate after day 14, but something makes me think I'm earlier.  I had a migraine three days in a row Monday-Wednesday.  I've read that hormone induced migraines can be either at the time of your period when hormone levels drop or during ovulation when they spike.  My BBT charting has also been interesting.  It's been pretty stable except for the 2 days we were at the cabin.  My first 3 days of charting it was 97.6 degrees, then Saturday morning at the cabin it dropped to 97.0.  Sunday I had a spike of 97.9 then Monday through Wednesday back at home it was 97.7, so a little higher than before, but stable.  Then today it went back up to 97.9.  I kind of feel like tomorrow it will inch up a little more or I'll have the real spike that means I ovulated.  If so, then it's a good thing we were together last night.  I'm sure it's pointless to say, but I really hope I get pregnant this month.  Although I'm definately functional, I think I'm in a bit of a depression.  I'm usually such a happy positive person, and although there hasn't been a complete reversal, I feel like every happiness still has a little shadow.  I'm really tired of that, I want to be truely happy again.  I hope being pregnant will do that for me.  It's what I want most.  When Eric asked me what I wanted for Christmas, the only thing I can think of is to be pregnant.  He's doing his best, but I definately won't be finding out at Christmas.  If this month works I could find out as soon as Dec 1, but definately by Dec 8.  If not, it will be January for the next month.  I'll post more if anything exciting happens.

       It's been kind of busy the past few days so I haven't had time to post.  The weekend getaway was pretty good.  All the alone time and being with my sweetie was great, but I would probably pick a different location next time.  Actually this location wouldn't have been bad if we would have done some research in advance and had some things to do.  We got to the castle on Friday at about 7:30 p.m.  We checked in and got to check out the cottage.  It was nice, but definately more on the rugged cabin end of the spectrum than posh hotel suite.  We used the jacuzzi tub, which was fun, but the water smelled like rust and we weren't allowed to use bubbles with the jets running.  The cottage came equipped with a 13" TV/VCR combo and a supply of old movies, and by old I mean 1970's or earlier.  The TV was only good for watching movies, no cable.  On Saturday we went to breakfast at the castle, which was ok, considering it was included in our room rate.  Then we were stuck with the what do we do question.  We took a walk around the property, but it was pretty cold out, so we decided to drive to a town to look for a Blockbuster to rent a movie to watch.  The nearest town (15 miles) didn't have a Blockbuster so we drove to a bigger town about 30 miles away, back towards Columbus.  We found a Blockbuster and rented a movie and then decided to head over to BW3's for lunch and to watch the OSU football game.  We ended up watching the whole game and then made it back to the castle around 5:00 p.m.  We hung out in the cottage until dinner in the castle.  We ate at a table with another couple and were served by people dressed in Midevil clothes.  Dinner wasn't great, but we had snacks back in the cottage.  Then we went back and watched our movie.  Sunday we just got up packed and headed home.  Back in Columbus, we went to watch the Matrix Revolutions movie in a matinee and then picked up Zeus from the kennel.  Overall a decent weekend and we did get a chance to have some "romantic" time in a different setting than normal.

       I'm looking forward to our weekend getaway this weekend.  I've packed the bags and scheduled the kennel.  We'll be leaving right after we get home from work and take Zeus to the kennel.  I'm hoping it will be a great weekend to just unwind, relax, and spend some quality time together.  Some romance would be nice too.  We scheduled this trip right after the loss as a sort of healing time.  We seem pretty healed right now, but being together will be really nice.  I have been doing the BBT charting for 3 days now.  It's kind of weird, but it's been exactly the same every day.  I wonder if I'll be able to tell when it changes and I ovulate.  Got some disappointing news earlier.  Erica is NOT pregnant.  I really thought this was it for her.  She'll try again though and sooner or later it will work.  It's still early for her.  On an upside, this gives us another chance to get pregnant at the same time.  Our periods were only 4 days apart so we could both get pregnant this month.  That would be cool.

       I'm getting focused and ready to start "trying" again.  This morning I remembered to take my BBT and chart it.  Hopefully that will be of some help this month.  If not, at least I get to make a chart and I enjoy that.  Been chatting alot with my friend Erica and am about 95% convinced that she succeeded this month.  Hopefully we'll find out this weekend.    Remember Ava? (See Oct. 24 entry).  Well I found a link that might help explain her intuition.  It's a  urlLink Chinese Gender Birth Chart  .  You take the Mother's age at conception and the month of conception and it tells whether the baby is a boy or girl.  If Erica's pregnant now (October) and I get pregnant on this try (November) then she will have a boy and I will have a girl, like Ava predicted.  Cool, huh!  I tried it out and it worked for Tammy!  I also wanted to add a link for anyone interested in charting BBT to get a blank chart.  The thermometer usually comes with one, but here's a  urlLink link .

       Had a good weekend.  Did alot of cleaning around the house.  I even cleaned out the closet in the computer room, which is where we tend to throw stuff that we don't know what to do with.  Eric and I also went to see Dracula at the Ballet on Saturday night.  It was really good.  I'm so impressed by the athleticism of the dancers.  It was a good story line too, not too much foo foo dancing stuff.  Eric said he'd see another ballet with me, so I figure that's a good start.  If you want an explanation of the heading, today is Day 1 if I get pregnant this month.  Yes, that's right, I started my period.  I'm kind of excited, because Friday was 4 weeks (28 days), so I really started pretty quickly.  Eric and I are going away this weekend, but I think it's too early for conception.  It will still be nice to just get away and be together though.  The week of the 17th is probably our best bet.  I think the safest thing is probably just to be fairly consistent all month long.  One more week until we found out how Erica did this month.  I read her blog and it seems like it's a possibility.  She's had some strange food experiences and mentioned that's she's had trouble sleeping. I'm not sure if it relates, but I had trouble sleeping right before I found out I was pregnant.  Doesn't really seem like it should be a symptom, but who knows.  We'll keep you posted.

       Still waiting.  Tomorrow will be the big test day.  Although, I'm trying not to get my hopes up too much.  It may still be too early.  From reading the TCOYF book (everyone should really read by the way), it says that your lutal phase never varies more than 1 day on either side.  I've only completed 1 month of charting, so for me this means that my Lutal Phase could be from 11 to 14 days long.  (If 12 is my average it could be 11 or 13, if 12 was 1 day less than average it could be 13 or 14 too.  So anyway, testing at 12 DPO may be a little early.  Conservatively, if not pregnant, the absolute latest AF could come would be Saturday.  I'll test tomorrow because finding out on New Year's eve would be cool.  If negative, I'll probably test again on Friday.  I feel pretty good about it this month.  Today I had a beautiful high temperature, 98.3.  That's my highest post-O temp after excluding the one 98.6 that was effected by outside factors.  So we will see what tomorrow brings.  Hopefully, a BFP (big fat positive) for me and no AF for Erica.  (I'm hoping for no AF, because that could mean that her ovulation was delayed because of stress, etc. and not that she has normally perfect cycles with no ovulation.)

       Ok, so here's the baby scoop from the long weekend.  I was right that Christmas has helped keep my impatience to a minimum.  I'm still feeling pretty confident, but am dying for the chance to take this test.  As of now I'm planning on testing the day my period is due rather than waiting until it's a day late, unless I have any negative indications with my temps.  Last month they dropped below the coverline on both 11 DPO and 12 DPO and then AF came on 13 DPO.    My temp taking was fairly consistant while traveling, although I took it about a half hour early on Christmas Day and 12/26.  On Friday, I was a little nervous because it dropped below the coverline.  My coverline is at 97.7 and my post-O temps have been between 97.8 and 98.1 (that's leaving out the one fluke at 98.6 and the dip I'm describing now).  On Friday it was down to 97.6, but it came back up to 98.0 the next day.  If I turn out to be pregnant, I think it could have been an implantation dip, as it was 7 DPO.  I also felt a little crampy on Christmas Day.   Only 4 more days to wait.  I also picked up the Taking Charge of Your Fertility book by Terri Weschler (maybe spelled wrong).  It's awsome so far.  I agree that everyone needs to read this regardless of whether they are trying to get pregnant or not.  We'll see how it goes, but I may consider using the FAM (Fertility Awarness Method) as birth control after I have a baby.  It's nice to think I may not have to deal with the hormonal changes the Pill causes.   The upside, if I don't get pregnant this month, I've learned more to use next month.  I can't wait to get filled in on Erica's situation on Monday.  From what I've read in this book, it doesn't seem possible that she hasn't ovulated over the past 4 cycles.  She's been way too regular for that.  She thought that she possibly ovulated last Sunday, Day 19, but that's the last I heard from her.  I'm kind of hoping stress caused her to ovulate late this month (holidays, sister situation, etc.), that would cause AF to be "late" this month.  That makes more since to me then her not ovulating at all for 4 months, but still having AF like clockwork.  It just doesn't add up to me.  Ok, I should probably go to bed.  I'm hoping for another high temp tomorrow.  Maybe a really high one and we'll see if I can get a triphasic chart.

       Have you missed me?  It's been a crazy long weekend.  Although good.  Eric and I did our Christmas on Tuesday night 12/23.  He spoiled me and I loved it.  I got a beautiful diamond necklace and a pair of gold hoop earings that I had wanted.  Also the white athletic socks and 2004 Pug calendar I wanted.  My gifts for him weren't quite as perfect and we spent today returning them and he picked up 5 DVD's that he wanted.  I also let him buy us 2 tickets for the Indianapolis Colts playoff game in Round 1, so it looks like we'll be heading back to Indiana next weekend.  On Christmas Eve I worked until 12:30 p.m. (whew, I got a lot done too) and Eric worked until about 3:30 p.m.  We hit the road at 4:15 p.m.  and arrived at Grandma's around 8:00 p.m.  It was nice, Mom, Dad, and Jeremy were already there.  Mom also finished my wedding scrapbook (after 2 1/2 years) and it's wonderful.  Christmas morning we got up and did Christmas with my Mom and Dad and brother.  We haven't done that in a while.  Mom got me a nice bookshelf stereo system for work (although I'll probably end up keeping it at home, it's really cool.) and Eric got his favorite gift of the holiday, a authintic Marvin Harrison Colts jersey.  He really raked in the Colts gear.  Christmas day there were a ton of people at Grandma's house.  All of my aunt's and uncles came, only one cousin, spouse and children were missing.  Let's see that's 31 people and 3 dogs.  Christmas night we went to see Cheaper by the Dozen (good family movie) and then spent the night in a hotel with my parents.  On Friday, we got up and headed to Bloomington to my brother-in-laws house.  We got there around 10:30 a.m. and spent the day with my Donna, Kyle, Ashton, and Logan.  Leslie had to work until 6, but then came home and we spent the evening.  We had our gift exchange there and it was very nice.  Saturday, we volunteered to watch the kids while Kyle and Leslie went to work and after loading up the car and stopping to feed the baby her breakfast, headed to Eric's Dad's house.  I think we did ok on baby sitting.  Between the two of us, we changed 3 diapers, and fed the baby both baby food and formula.  I also changed her outfit once.  Oh yeah, we're ready.  Saturday afternoon we did another gift exchange.  My favorite gift from that exchange was a journal chest.  It's kind of like a hope chest, but it comes with a journal and some ideas of what things to keep and you are supposed to journal yearly.  That will be nice to get started.  Saturday night we left around 7:00 p.m. and headed for home.  We got in right around 11:00 p.m . and thankfully got to sleep in our own bed.  Holidays are nice, but it's good to be home.

       It's official.  After 3 days of elevated temps.  I ovulated on Friday.  Now to wait.  Testing dates are confusing to me.  If I still have a 12 day lutal phase my period is expected on January 1.  I may test on January 2.  Hopefully the next 10 days will go quickly.  With Christmas and New Year's in between, it should go fast.

       Ok, so I think I may have ovulated yesterday.  It's three days earlier than last month, but I had a definate temperature spike today.  All of my temps this month have been between 97.2 and 97.7.  To detect ovulation, you look for a temp .2 degrees higher than the previous six days.  For me that would have been 97.8 since my highest temp in the last 6 days was 97.6.  This morning it was 97.9.  To confirm ovulation, I'll have to monitor and make sure they stay up there for the next three days to be sure it wasn't just a fluke temperature.  I was planning on Monday being my O-day, so I was planning on spending this weekend focusing on the trying part.  I'm ok with it if it was Friday though, since last Saturday, we've been doing the every other day thing so I'm pretty sure we were in the window.  It will be interesting.  Since the lutal phase doesn't usually change, if I did ovulate on Friday I'll have a 28 day cycle this month.  That means that AF will now be due on 1/1/04 and I'll see if I can wait to test until 1/2/04.  Very interesting.  I'll update more after I see what my temps do tomorrow.

       I don't know why, but around this time of month, I tend to get a little frustrated and think about throwing in the towel.  Not sure why, but I feel like it's not going to happen.  That doesn't make since, since I haven't even ovulated yet, but it feels like a lot of pressure.  I just don't like this in between stage.  If I was pregnant I could concentrate on that.  If I wasn't trying, I could go full force at the diet and exercise plan.  Now, I'm just sort of wishy-washy.  Hopefully, this stage won't last too long.  I see my friend Kim at work who reminds me of where I would be with my first baby.  It seems like it's going to fast.  April seems so close.  Then sometimes I'm glad that I'm not pregnant yet, because it would be almost over.  I suppose that's just because I haven't had all the experiences that go along with being pregnant.  I want to enjoy all of those moments.  That probably doesn't make any since to anyone but me, but oh, well.  Currently, things are still going as planned.  My temps are still staying steady, so I am definately a later ovulator.  Eric and I have been prepared in case it happens earlier, but I I'm still expecting either late this weekend or Monday.  Then the hard waiting game begins.

       It's been a busy weekend.  Friday I did the necessary chores around the house including grocery shopping and laundry.  Saturday, I went to a cookie exchange party at my neighbors which was really fun, but lasted from about 12 to 4, and was murder on my eating habits.  I also had to make the dough and stuff beforehand and felt like sleeping in, so I skipped the workout.  From 7 to 10 we had the Christmas Party at the bosses house, which was fun.  We may have found a new couple to befriend.  There's a fairly new guy in my office and I got to meet his new wife of 6 weeks.  She was cool and Eric liked the guy I work with, so we may try to get together sometime.  Sunday, I went to church with my neighbor, then after church we brought home the church ladder to change our entryway lightbulbs.  That was an adventure, but we got it done.  Sunday night the Survivor season finale was on, so that took up the whole evening.  None of my favorites won, but at least John didn't either, so that's cool by me.  Ok, the baby subject.  I've had a pretty relaxing first two weeks (almost) of this cycle.  I haven't been freaking out about how often and when to try.  I'm using last cycle as a guideline and feel like I'm just now coming up on the time where trying becomes important.  My expected ovulation date is in 1 week, next Monday.  I can really only worry about it until Tuesday, because then we're out of town from Wednesday night until Sunday.  Another good thing is the hard waiting time will be in the midst of Christmas and New Year's so maybe I'll be too busy to obsess.  I'm fairly confident this time, that we'll be able to time things better.  Last month, I was so worried about missing ovulation time that by the time it finally got here (Day 19) we were sort of burnt out on the trying frequency.  We'll see what happens.    Well, lunch is over and I have work to do.

       I've been posting so much in my Diet/Fitness blog that it seems like I'm neglegting this one.  Although, I just posted yesterday...  I think it's good I'm focusing on getting in shape again, at least that's something else to concentrate on this month.  I'll need to start gearing up for the "trying" phase again.  I don't really want it to be, but it kind of becomes a different mindset.  If I was a "normal" girl, I could be ovulating in about a week.  I'm thinking it will be closer to last month so I've still got about a week and a half, but I think I should at least be semi-prepared in case I'm early.  I'm thinking this is Month 2 and 2 was my lucky month last time.  Ok, I really don't have anything interesting to write about and it's about bed time, so I'll end for today.  Hopefully next week will start to get more interesting on the baby front.

       I was doing some baby related thinking today.  Waiting is hard.  Sometimes I think God makes us wait (teaches us patience) so we will really appreciate things when they come to us.  Before trying to conceive I never imagined that I would have difficulties or lose a baby.  Actually, I thought more about NOT being able to get pregnant than losing a baby.  The thought of a miscarriage never entered my mind.  Even when I got pregnant, I could read the scary parts of the What to Expect book and not really worry.  I was more concerned about the changes happening to my body, than to worry about the life inside me.  Now I think about that.  The longer I wait to conceive again, the more I worry that I'll be scared while I'm pregnant.  Initially I thought, that I would be able to relax after I make it to the first Dr. appointment and I get to see the heart beat.  That didn't happen last time.  I still hope that's true.  I'm not usually a worrier and I don't want to spend 9 months being afraid.  I want to enjoy every moment.  I think another example of my fear is considering when I want to tell people I'm pregnant again.  Of course I'll tell my family and close friends.  Although, last time I made a big deal and it was special the way I told my parents.  Now they know we're trying and we discuss it throughout the month.  There are a couple of people I'm close to at work that I will probably tell immediately. (Tammy, Kim, and Heidi, probably Kristin too, since I dragged her into my feminine cycle so she knows when I'm expected AF).  I think the rest of the workplace will wait until after the first trimester, well at least until I have that first doctor appointment.  I'm not sure why I want to wait.  If I lose another, I'd want them to know, but I think I'd kind of like to have my little secret for a while.  We'll see what happens, I thought I'd wait a couple of weeks last time, and I told everyone within 3 days.  This post is starting to get long, so I'll make this my final thought for now.  I think about Erica alot.  If I could say a little prayer (I already did earlier) my hope is that Erica gets pregnant first.  I'd love for it to happen the same month.  This one is fine, as we'd have the same due date, but if only one of us gets it, I want it to be her.  When there's something you want very badly, time seems to almost stand still.  This is month 4 for her which must seem like an eternity.  It seems right that she's been trying longer, so she should get it first.  (Technically, I've been trying longer if you count the first one, but I think the counting starts over).  I also pray that my experiences won't rob any of the innocence and excitement from her.  I'm a little scared about getting pregnant again, but I don't want her to have any fear.  Ideally, this will be the month for both of us and we can be amazed together as we count down the weeks.  It only seems right that we would have babies very close together, since we were born only days apart.  Ok, I'm really done now.  It just feels good to get your thoughts down sometimes.

       I took Danialle's example and started a Diet/Exercise blog.  The link is attached.  I'm thinking making it public will make me more likely to stick to the program.  I think I really mean it this time.  I'm even planning on getting up early and going to the gym before work.  I wonder how that will affect my temp reading.  I guess I'll start taking it earlier every day, so days I go to the gym in the a.m. won't affect my readings.  Whew, this could be complicated.

       This is my usual Sunday evening recap.  Nothing really exciting going on, except I started coming down with a cold yesterday and now it's here.  Since, I know I'm not pregnant right now, I'm taking cold medicine and that makes me feel better.  I didn't do that workout yesterday, although I'm still planning on dieting this week.  A cold usually makes me less hungry, so that should help a bit.     I finished up my Christmas shopping yesterday.  Yeah!  Now I just have to be patient before giving all my gifts away.  It's been a pretty quiet weekend, not too much to report.  I'm just procrastinating instead of wrapping gifts right now.  I better get to it.  I'll check in later this week.

       Yes, that's right.  I had a vistitor this afternoon.  One more positive from charting, I kind of expected it.  It's also interesting that my Lutal Phase was only 12 days.  They only consider it a problem if it's under 10, but I'll be curious to see if it's always 12 days.  Supposedly, that doesn't change.  Hopefully, I won't be able to find out because I'll be pregnant next month, but we'll see.  Also, interesting that this cycle was 31 days.  Is it a pattern?  For sure, the dieting is starting Monday.  I'm going to attempt to jump start it with a workout on Saturday.  I'm going to try to be strict too.  Especially no sweets!  Ok, Erica, we have the same LMP now.  Let's see what happens in December.

       I don't think this is the month. :(  As you can see from the title of the post, no AF yet, but I'm guessing that could change by the end of the day or tomorrow.  Today was my 3rd day in a row with temps below coverline, and I actually dipped again today to my average post-O temp.  Despite still feeling a little nauseous, I also feel incredibly fat and a tiny bit crampy.  I trust the temps and that AF will be here soon.  Positives: - If AF shows up today, that will officially make this a 31 day cycle and I would have had 2 in a row the same length. - By charting, I know I ovulated. - By charting, I didn't take tests early, and therefore, didn't waste any money this month (on tests at least) - I won't be having an August baby.  (Not that September will be any cooler). - I have at least 1 more month where I'm allowed to diet and see if I can shed some weight.  Ok, got to work.

       Not a whole lot happening this week.  I've had a lot to keep me busy at work.  Turns out this week is going faster than expected.  Yesterday, I finished up a lot of the paperwork from our 12/1 renewal, and then today I kept having little questions or issues pop up that I had to deal with.  Today was also Eric's birthday, so we went out to dinner.  Tomorrow, will be a pretty worthless day at work.  I have a continuing education class on Policy Checking (fun stuff) from 9:30 to noon.  Then my boss is picking me up by my house at 3:15 p.m to head to Cincinnati for a client Christmas Dinner.  Cocktails start at 6:00 p.m., so it looks like it will be a long night.  We are driving back though, so at least that won't eat up my Thursday.  Thursday, we have some college students in the office interviewing, so I have to go to a lunch to discuss life as a recent grad.  I wonder how long, I get that title?  I've been out of school for about 2 1/2 years now.  I was supposed to start dieting with my girls this week.  They are doing good, but I'm a complete failure.  Caught a glimpse of my reflection in the mirror this afternoon, and can I say UGGH.  I didn't realize how much I'd miss that BFL body.  I know it's just a matter of will, but I seem to be having problems with that lately.  I'm going to try to be reasonable in December, but told Eric that our New Year's resolutions will be to get back in shape.  He's gained back about 25 of the 35 pounds he lost this year.  Sigh...  At least we are getting fat together, so neither of us can really complain.    Nothing has changed on the baby front yet.  My temperature dipped below my coverline today.  I don't really know what that means.  I've also felt slightly nauseous the past two evenings.  Yesterday I also had a killer headache though, which tends to make me nauseous under any circumstances, and today I spent most of the morning with my boss who was definately under the weather.  He looked like Death warmed over by 4:00 p.m., so I'm not counting on that as a symptom.  Mostly I just feel normal.  There's really no way to tell before a pregnancy test.  Any "symptoms" are only obvious in hind-sight.  Only 5 more days until I can test (closer to 4 by this time of night).  If this month isn't it, I'm thinking next month will be a toughie.  If my cycle is a similar length of time, I'll be fertile right around Christmas time, when we'll be at a variety of relatives houses.  We are NOT going to break those "rules."  We may just have to wait until January. :)  I guess that just gives me more time to get in shape!  Better start now!

       So, I am confused again.  Remeber earlier when I said AF was here?  This may be too much information, but I have to write it somewhere.  I came home from the gym earlier about 1:00 p.m. and went to the restroom, there was a little bit of brown discharge and a little more when I wiped.  I assumed that meant AF was here, so I put in a tampon and forgot about it.  Well, I never have "spotting" when AF comes.  It just starts, and it's not usually brown it's bright red, so I was thinking about that and the fact that I'm not really crampy like I usually am the day I start.  So...I went up and checked my tampon.  There was a little on it, but all brown, no red and now when I wipe...nothing.  So I put on a pantyliner and will see what develops.  I also took my temp, which means nothing this time of day, but it was 98.7 which seems high to me.  I'm not really sure what I'm saying, but technically a new cycle doesn't start until the first day of regular flow, spotting doesn't count.  Like I said, I've never spotted before AF before, so I'm not really sure what's going on.  I guess I'll keep watch for the real stuff and see what my temps do tomorrow?  It seems really late for any implantation signs like temp dip or spotting.  Hmmm...

       Ok, so not so confused anymore, AF decided to show today.  That means I had a 27 day cycle!  I don't know if that's every happened.  Because of it being so short, I'm thinking that maybe I did actually ovulate on Day 14 instead of 16.  That would mean my LP was 13 days this month (or 11?).  Anyway, it wasn't 12 or 15 which were my previous numbers.  I thought getting AF would make my cycles easier to interpret this month.  That would be too easy though.  Anyway...  I can honestly say that I'm not that crushed.  It happened before I was ready to start testing and I really had prepared myself for a negative.    Positives for this month:  1.  Another good month to work on BFL.  I lost 5.5 pounds this month, I may be back into my smaller clothes by the end of next month.  2.  I didn't take a test!  No money wasted.  3.  The work situation I was concerned about would be a little better for a pregnancy this month.  4.  Baby due no sooner than mid-November, we're getting into less of a "summer" pregnancy.  5.  Erica and I still have a shot at doing this together.  Our cycles are now 1 day apart.  We'll see what happens this month.  I kind of liked not stressing.  I'll try to do that again.  I'll get pregnant when the time is right.  Well, I guess I should schedule my annual exam now.  They sent me a card a few weeks ago, but I wanted to wait to call until I knew whether I'd have a pregnancy appointment first.  I'm not due for my exam until mid-April, but I'll get my appointment on the calendar and hopefully, they'll turn that one into a pregnancy appointment.  I was also thinking, if nothing happens by then, I'll have a lot of good months to take my charts in.  This could be it.  They say that even with perfect timing, you only have about a 20% shot of pregnancy in any one cycle.  That means that most people will get pregnant within 6 months of trying if they have good timing, etc.  I know we had good timing on 2 of the 3 months and ok timing on the other one.  Statistically, every month we don't succeed makes it more likely the next month.  Ok, gotta clean the house for our Superbowl party.

       Not really sure what to think this morning.  My temp plunged down to 97.6, which is still above my coverline, but .4 is a pretty big hit.  I took that at my normal time, and then went back to sleep.  I woke up for good about 3 hours later and decided to retake just for kicks and at 9:00 a.m. it was up to 98.4, so who knows.  I guess I'll see what tomorrow brings.  If it's in the same vicinity tomorrow, my guess is that AF will arrive by Monday.  Now today I'm feeling a bit crampy, but honestly I'm not sure if it's "cramps" or "other stomach issues."  That's as much information as you need.  If AF does come, I hope she comes tomorrow, so I'll know that I do "regularly" have a 12 day LP.  Ok, stuff to do.  I'll update if she decides to arrive today.

       Do you ever know you have alot to do, but have no desire to do it?  That's kind of how I feel right now.  I have 12 people coming to my house on Sunday, so I should probably start cleaning, so I won't have to do it all on Sunday morning, but have I cleaned this evening?  No.  I at least thought I'd do my meal plans for next week, so I could go to the grocery store in the morning when I'm out at the gym.  Have I done that?  No.  So what have I done this evening?  I got home from the gym at 7p.m., then made some dinner and sort of laid around on the couch.  Then I got up and cleaned up a little of my mess in the kitchen and tried that dip.  Oh yeah, I also wrote all of the receipts in the checkbook.  All that and it's already 9:30 p.m.  I could start cleaning now, but that seems like a waste.  I kind of feel like heading to bed, but it's awfully early for a Friday night.

       First of all I want to say I'm sorry for Erica and her BFN this morning. :(  It's so disappointing when it looks so promising.  Lots of long distance hugs to you!  If it helps you kept me from sleeping much too.  Everytime it would cross my mind last night my stomach would clench up, then I had a crazy dream this morning.  You were here for a GWO and took your test in my guest bathroom.  There were clearly too lines and I gave you a big hug and we went out to the guest bedroom to tell Danialle.  (That's the normal part of the dream, there was also a weird guy from my office in the dream and for some reason we were all in bath towels, hmm.)  It'll happen Erica, don't give up hope.  Not much new to say for me.  I had another day of a 98.0 temperature.  This month is hard to interpret because my chart is alot different than last month.  I'm on the countdown now and will be testing in 5 days, unless AF arrives first.  Looks like she won't be coming today, which means either A) I could be pregnant or B) if not pregnant, I didn't ovulate on day 14 with a 12 day LP.  I definately don't expect AF tomorrow, but possibly on Sunday if I ovulated day 16 with a 12 day LP.

       I'm getting so anxious for Erica.  I got up this morning and couldn't wait to check her blog to see how her temps were doing.  I think tomorrow will be the telling day.  That is the day AF will be due for her on her "normal" cycles.  If the temps are still up, she'll have one more day to wait and then can take that test.  Believe it or not, I haven't been obsessing this month nearly as much as previously.  For some reason I'm just assuming I'm not.  We made plans to go to a fancy dinner with Will & Samara next weekend, and Samara mentioned that they have great wine, but I wouldn't be able to drink any, and I corrected her and said that I'll know by then, and if not pregnant I'll be in the "safe zone."  I'm not even assuming that it worked.  Hopefully, that will make it easier if I'm not, and if I am...then I can get excited.   My temps aren't as convincing as Erica's, but they are still plenty high and aren't giving me any reason to worry.  Seven days until test.

       I've done some re-arranging and have added a new link called "glossary."  I added common terms and abbreviations used both in my TTC journey (look it up!) and in my diet, and with the girls.  I put it on my own site, so if anyone wants me to add anything let me know and I'll try to keep it up to date.

       Just stole Erica's link to her chart and added mine.  That is so nice that other people can check and comment.  By the way Erica your's looks great!  I think that dip on Day 8 could be promising considering it went back up and is still nice and high!  4 more days!

       I e-mailed a question on Fertility Friend and they changed the detector on my chart and it now agrees with me on the day 16 ovulation.  For some reason that makes me feel better.  Earlier today I was thinking about when to expect my period.  It could come on 4 different days depending on when I ovulated and how long my lutal phase is.  Either this Friday (Day 14 O-day & 12 day LP), next Sunday (Day 16 O-Day & 12 day LP), next Monday (Day 14 O-day & 15 day LP), or next Wednesday (Day 16 O-day & 15 day LP).  Because of that variation I'll be waiting to test until next Wednesday (as long as I wake up that day with high temps).  My temps are still nice and high right now, and I've seemed really tired, so maybe that's a good sign, but I'm sure it's too early to notice any pregnancy symptoms even if I am.  Maybe next weekend I can speculate more on that.

       I think there's something about the lutal phase, but I get very down on myself and discouraged.  I have no reason to feel negative, but for some reason I feel like quitting.  I seem to remember feeling this way last month too.  Maybe it's some hormonal thing?  Progesterone makes me crazy?  Anyway, my temps have been nice and high and it's too early for any signs or symptoms either way, but I just feel blah!  I don't know how people do this month after month.  I'm pretty confident that this won't take too much longer, but I think after 6 months of charting, 3 more complete months, I'll take a break if I'm not pregnant yet, that seems to be Eric's ideal way to do it.   Sure I say that, then I'd be a mess not knowing when i ovulated or if I was "late".  I know not knowing exactly when it happened made me crazy last time I was pregnant.  Ok, so I'll keep charting.  It's just going to be a long 13 days.

       Still not sure about O-day, but I'm calling it Monday.  Today's temp was way up at 98.0, but I'm going to count all of the other indicators and call it Monday.  So now the waiting begins.  At least Erica's results will be in before mine, so I have another day to look forward to first.  I hope the next 2 weeks go fast.  I'm not planning on testing until 2/4.  That would be 16 days past ovulation if Monday was the day.  My longest lutal phase was 15 days, so that should be safe.    Let's just focus on the diet and exercise until then.  I've lost 3 1/2 pounds in the last 2 1/2 weeks, so that's good.  I'll just keep that up.

       So I'm a little confused.  I'm pretty sure I ovulated, but I'm not sure what day.  My temp was 97.4 this morning and all of my CM has dried up.  I also had some pains in my lower regions yesterday afternoon/evening that are not there today, that could have been ovulation pains.  My temps however, suggest that Saturday may have been the day.  I'm not sure how much weight to give that though, since I had some wine throughout the evening on Saturday.  Regardless, I'm pretty sure that ovulation has occurred and now I just need to wait to see if it worked.  I'm hoping O-day was Monday rather than Saturday, because of our timing with "trying", but Saturday may give us a good shot too.  Erica sent me an e-mail about her huge temp rise this morning (5 DPO).  I think that looks like a really good sign.  I'll be curious to see what this month brings her.  Hopefully a positive HPT and no AF.

       We're getting to the important time of the month now.  Last month I ovulated on Day 16, so I'm thinking this could be the day.  Despite GWO, we've done a good job on the window, so if I see a spike tomorrow, I'll feel pretty good.  We'll probably try again tonight to feel a little more confident.  We got great news for Erica as her temperatures over the weekend confirmed that she did in fact ovulate this month, and thankfully, it happened before she left for our weekend.  Looks like they may have had good timing too, so we'll keep our fingers crossed.  Hopefully there will be at least one positive pregnancy test this month.  I don't really feel that stressed this month.  I'm not taking it for granted now.  I think before I kind of assumed that it would happen really fast for me, since last time it did.  Then last month, I thought we timed everything perfectly, so this month, I'm going to try to relax and just see what happens.  I'm serious about the diet and exercise now, so that's where I've been trying to put most of my focus.  We'll see what happens.  We've only got about 10 days to wait for Erica to test.

       Wow, what a weekend.  Today ends the 3rd GWO.  We of course had a great time.  Everyone got in safely on Friday and we spent the evening catching up on all the gossip.  Saturday we had our "free day" breakfast at First Watch and it was heavenly.  Erica and Danialle are also on the BFL diet thing so we were definately looking forward to Saturday.  After breakfast we found a scrapbook store that we browsed for a while.  Then we headed over to pick up Samara and go to the mall at Easton.  It was a really icky day, so we did most of our shopping indoors, but it was still a good time to see the girls.  Then the highlight of the evening was our dinner at the Melting Pot.  For anyone who hasn't had fondue, you're missing out.  All of us ladies certainly made it interesting as we sat and ate for 3 1/2 hours.  Our waiter didn't seem to be especially happy with his job, but Heather made it more interesting for him, by getting his number at the end of the evening.  Sunday, Heather headed for home, but the rest of us decided not to shower or do hair or makeup and went to browse at Babies R Us.  That definately got at least 2 of us in baby mode.  Hopefully soon we'll be able to shop there.  After shopping we went back to the house saw the final sad moments of the Colts game and then played some dominoes.  Dominoes lasted well into the evening and then Danialle and I ended the evening with some insightful discussion while waiting on Eric to decide he was ready for bed.  Monday morning we made quick breakfast and the rest of the girls left.  Ahh, good times and only 3 more months until we can do it again.

       It's been a while since I posted.  I guess I was so into my dieting that keeping that blog updated has been enough to keep me busy.  I had a not so relaxing weekend, so I'm looking forward to my days off this week and my upcoming Girl's Weekend Out.  Eric has decided to redo the basement, which I think is a good idea, considering the decor when we moved in was a baseball theme and he's been hanging all his Colt's items, which is football.  I finally agreed to his idea on painting the color to the Colt's blue, but we will also be adding a grey ragging technique on top.  Anyway, to get the process started we have to take down the wallpaper.  Not fun.  Eric had football to watch this weekend, so I spent most of it in the basement stripping wallpaper.  It's a slow process.  He came down to help last night from 8:30 to 11, but we still aren't done.  I'm hoping we can finish getting the paper down tonight and paint tomorrow, so I can clean, work on my scrapbook and actually relax on my days off Thursday and Friday.  Really looking forward to my Girls Weekend.  I miss everyone even though we e-mail daily.  I am also looking forward to my girls meeting Samara, since she's my best friend here in town.  Hopefully everyone will get along and like each other and it will be tons of fun.  I think according to my past cycles, I'll probably start "trying" around Wednesday of this week.  That's using my earliest O-day (16) and the 5-day rule for sperm survival.  I'm not sure how the GWO will affect it.  That will probably be the best timing considering either a day 16 or 19 O-day.  We've said we will still try, but I'm not so sure, as I mentioned before, this wouldn't be a bad month to not get pregnant, so maybe we won't try that hard.  I don't know, we'll see.

       I've been doing all my posting in my Fitness blog this week.  Not much to talk about on the baby front.  My temps have been really low this month so far.  I wonder if they are getting back to "normal."  It's quite possible it is taking my body a little while to get on a "normal" cycle because I was on the pill, then pregnant, and now not.  That's ok.  I'm not really as pumped about trying this month.  I think last month was just a real bummer.  I've actually started thinking about if I get pregnant this month my due date would be in mid-October, then I would be back from maternity leave in mid-December.   November to January are my absolute busiest months at work, so I'd be coming back to work right in the thick of it.  I guess we'll see what happens.  I'm certainly not delaying my trying to work around my work schedule.

       Yes, that's right.  AF found me bright and early this morning.  I took my temp and saw a 97.4 and knew this wait was over.  Sure enough when I got out of bed and into the restroom, AF had arrived.  I'm sad.  Ok, let's look for the positives this month.   1.  At least AF came in the morning, so I was prepared for the day at the Colts game.   (That was completely awesome by the way). 2.  Since the Colt's game was today I was busy all day and didn't really have time to mope. 3.  Another month of charting gives me some history and I know I ovulated. 4.  Another cycle of exactly 31 days. 5.  Baby won't be due until at least October (a little cooler?). 6.  At least one full month of dieting with weight loss goals is possible.  I think I'm out.  Here are the negatives I can't quite put away. 1.  I really want a baby. 2.  What the heck kind of history do I have with a 12 day and 15 day lutal phase?  Isn't only supposed to vary by 1 day? 3.  I really want a baby. 4.  I wasted money on 3 pregnancy tests. 5.  I really want a baby. 6.  I'm driving my husband crazy. 7.  I really want a baby. 8.  I have to wait another MONTH?! 9.  I really wanted my first baby.  Well, my new chart starts today and we'll see what 2004 brings us.  At least I enjoy charting, but I hope I don't have to wait much longer.  If I hadn't lost my baby, I would be 26 weeks pregnant or towards the end of my 6th month.  I really want to be pregnant and have been to the doctor and know everything's ok before my first due date gets here.  If there isn't another baby on the way, that will be a very sad day for me.  Ok, I should head to bed.  Tomorrow starts my 2004 dieting resolution.  I have my meals packed already, but I will have to go to the gym, so I should get my sleep.

       I thought I'd update tonight since I may not get a chance tomorrow.  Still nothing today, but I'm for some reason feeling discouraged.  I've felt slightly crampy.  Nothing major and it could just be gas, but I keep running to the restroom to check.  I think I'd feel better if my temps would have stayed up at the 98.3 range.  Tomorrow Eric and I are traveling back to Indy to go to the Colts playoff game.  I'm excited it should be really fun.  Hopefully it will take my mind off of things for a day.  I'll probably throw a tampon in my purse just in case, but hopefully I'll make it through another day with no AF.    If AF does come, I'll be really confused about my cycles.  I didn't think you could have this much variation in the lutal phase.  Hopefully, it's not a variation and I'm just pregnant.  Not knowing either way for sure is killing me.  Sigh...I suppose I'll know soon enough.

       So far so good.  Another day without a visitor.  This morning my temp was again 97.9, so while I wish I was still back up in the 98's I'm still above coverline and no change from yesterday.  Let's cross our fingers that today, like yesterday, brings no visitors.  Yesterday I really felt nauseous all day long.  I also had a headache for most of the afternoon.  Eric and I went to Steak and Shake for dinner, but I couldn't even eat my sandwich.  Not sure what that means, but I'll take what I can get.  I lied.  I couldn't wait until Monday so I took another test.  Still negative.  So that's three this month.  I bought some more yesterday, but now I really will wait until Monday.  Stupid tests.

       Well, AF didn't come yesterday.  Yeah!  This morning my temp was 97.9 at at 6:15 a.m.  I usually temp at 7:00 a.m. but Eric had to get up early for work and I really had to use the restroom so I did it early.  It's a lower temp than I wanted to see, but 97.7 is my coverline, so I'm still above it.  So I took another test.  Still negative.  I'm a little bummed, but I'm not giving up hope until AF comes.  So today I will hope that I have no visitor, which could be a good possibility since my temps didn't plunge yet.  As you may remember from a previous post.  I figured out that if your lutal phase only varies about a day on either side, the longest lutal phase I could have is 14 days.  (If 13 is my normal and last month it was short when it was 12 days, 14 would be my long cycle).  If that's the case, AF could come tomorrow.  So if I make it through today and tomorrow with no visitor, I'll be about 90% sure that I am in fact pregnant and these stupid pregnancy tests are really wrong.  In order to save some cash, I've decided to wait on my next test until Monday morning.  Monday I would be 17 DPO and personally about 98% sure I am pregnant.  Today my plans include finishing my major house cleaning project I started yesterday.  I still have to do the 2 upstairs bathrooms, my bedroom,  and the basement.  I also have another list of various projects to work on, so I'll try to get to most of those.  At 2:00 p.m. I have a dentist appointment.  I think I'll tell them not to X-ray just in case, but I really wish I was positive.  Ok, time for breakfast.

       I hope you all had a happy New Year's.  Ours was pretty good.  We went over to our best friend's Will and Samara's.  Samara and I started cooking some cheese fondue to snack on while we made a "fancy" dinner.  The fondue was awesome, now I'm really looking forward to our girl's weekend when we are actually going to a fondue restaurant.  Then we made the meal.  Samara made a Salmon dish for her and Will, but since Eric and I aren't big fish fans we made Chicken Cordon Bleu for us.  We also had a pesto angelhair pasta and salad.  For desert we had cream puffs with carmel, chocolate, and powdered sugar.  It was really pretty because Samara used her china for us, and focused a whole lot on presentation of the meal.    After we ate (about 10:30 p.m.) we broke out the new DVD trivial pursuit pop culture game Eric and I got for Christmas.  We played boys vs. girls and had a very close game, but the boys ended up winning the final question.  We played until about 1:30 p.m., but took a break to watch the ball drop and have that first New Year's kiss.   It was nice.  So the new year is hear and I think I need some goals.  Here they are. 1.  Get back in shape - I know this is cliche but I really don't like what's happened to my body in the last 6 months.  This goal will apply regardless of how soon I get pregnant.  I'm preparing the diet/exercise plan today and maybe even starting tomorrow, if I can get rid of some candy.  Monday will be the absolute latest I start. 2.  Go back to church.  I've neglected my spiritual life for a while.  I need to get back into a church family and get active.  I always like it when I'm involved, but then life seems to get in the way.  I definately think growing up going to church and with spiritual parents made me a better person and I want to give my children that chance as well. 3.  Work on my Scrapbook.  I still haven't started my GWO scrapbook and now I need to do the journaling in the one my Mom gave me.  Also I have the new journal chest that I need to get started on.  That seems pretty good for now.  Happy New Year's everyone!

       I should have wrote yesterday, but I never got a chance.  Here's what was going on at day 12 DPO.  I woke up early (too excited to sleep) and took my temp.  40 minutes early than normal it was still at a beautiful 98.3.  So I went to the bathroom and took a pregnancy test.  It was negative.  Despite the result, I wasn't that down.  Here's why.  I compared my chart from last month to the one from this month and have noticed some very interesting and, I think, important differences.  My temps in general are lower this month, but my pre-ovulatory pattern looks really similar to last month.  Then post ovulation both charts temps go up and sort of spike at around 5 DPO.  Then the changes happen.  Last month after 5 DPO, the temps headed back down and hovered right around the coverline for the next 7 days.  They didn't drop below coverline until 11 DPO and then they stayed below until AF started on 13 DPO.  This month my temps started dropping on 6 DPO again, and then actually dipped below coverline on 7 DPO.  Then on day 8, they went back up to where the 5 DPO spike was and have stayed well above coverline since.  My hopeful interpretation is that my egg implanted on 7 DPO and my temps went back up to keep my uterus "warm" for the egg to grow.  I've had some other symptoms that could either be pregnancy or other things like stress, PMS, etc.  Like I was really tired all day yesterday (12 DPO) and I've been a little moody and I have breast tenderness.  In itself, that's not enough to say I'm pregnant, but with my new temp pattern, I'm hopeful.  I also did some reasearch and think that your HCG levels are rarely high enough to be picked up in a HPT until about 14 DPO.  So even if I am pregnant, it may just be too early to detect.  Ok, so that was yesterday.  I woke up and took my temp this morning and it was 98.0.  I was hoping for another high like the last two days, but 98.0 is still above my coverline of 97.7, so I guess I'm ok with that.  Today I just have to wait around and hope AF doesn't come.  Today is the day it is due.  If AF doesn't come and my temp is still above the coverline tomorrow, I will test again.   Aaah, waiting, aint it fun?

       I've had a very nice ending (so far) to a very LONG week.  To start out, Friday was a pretty good day.  I called the bank to find out how much Eric's check was and found out that our tax refunds had been deposited.  Yeah!  Then my boss called me into his office to let me know about my raise and bonus for this year.  I'd like to preface by saying I had my review about 2 weeks ago and things went pretty well, plus I switched departments in July and am in a MUCH better situation.  (That's another conversation in itself).  Anyway, my raise is 8%!  The average for the office was 3% and I've been between 2-4% the other two years I've gotten raises.  Someone must think I'm doing a good job!  Then he told me my bonus amount which I think is awesome!  Probably shouldn't provide $ amounts online, but it will certainly help gets some bills paid off.  Oh yeah, my temp made it up to 98.0 too!  Today is Saturday and I woke up to a beautiful day.  I had an appointment to get my hair cut and highlighted at 12:15 p.m. so I did that.  Then I came home and took Zeus for a walk.  He appreciated it and now needs to rest a bit...    Still to do this weekend...tonight we're going to The Melting Pot (fondue place) with W & S for my birthday dinner.  (Monday, I'll be 25).  Then tomorrow, we'll probably go to church in the morning and then we have tickets to the Arena Football game at 3:00.  I'm in a really good mood.  Well, I should probably get off the computer and do something productive like study for my CPCU exam, but... we'll see.  I just hope the rest of the weekend goes as well.

       My temps are still headed upwards, so I think all is good.  Fertility Friend moved my O-day to Monday (day 23) so I am going to go with that one.  Now just 13 days to wait and we'll see how we did.

       Well, I think I ovulated.  My temp was up to 97.5 today which is .2 over the previous 6 days, but is still really low for me.  Fertility Friend gave me an O-date of Sunday (day22). I'm not so sure that's right.  If I had to put money on it, I'd say late Monday night or Tuesday morning.  I had some breast tenderness creep in Tuesday, so that makes me think I already had some progesterone flowing in there.  If I mess around in fertility friend and add 2 more days of temps at 97.5, it moves my O-date to Monday, so we'll see what happens for the next couple of days.  Regardless, I think we're in the wait for this stage.  I'll probably wait to test until the March 10th or 11th.    FINALLY!

       No spike.  Did you really expect different?  Took another OPK this afternoon.  Negative.  I'm taking that as a good sign that maybe I've already ovulated?  If I spike tomorrow I'll expect this to be a 36 day cycle.  That's long even for me.  But the longer this cycle goes the more it makes me think the cycle I got pregnant was like this, just I didn't know.  I put this in an e-mail to my girls a couple of days ago, but want to post here for me to look back on when I actually am pregnant and laugh about what I didn't know.    The logic. June Cycle We know AF arrived 35 days after stopping birth control pill.  We can assume with a 12 day LP, I ovulated on day 23.  July Cycle We know AF arrived 7/12 and positive HPT on 8/23 CD42. We also know there was a negative HPT on CD35 and BD occured on CD20 and CD24 among others.   Theory - if I ovulated on CD24 or CD25, I would have only been 10 or 11 DPO when I got the negative HPT on CD35 (too early).  That means that the breast changes I noticed on CD40 would have been 15 or 16 DPO and the positive HPT would have been on 17 or 18 DPO.  That timeline makes a lot of sense to me.  The moral of this story.  I've probably had cycles this long before and possibly got pregnant during one of them.  I'd like to see that happen again.  Ok, there's only so much I can talk about without annoying even myself.

       My temp was still down today.  97.1 at 7:00 a.m.  I didn't wake up when the alarm went off at 6:00 to temp, but it was still low, so I don't think my waking up late affected it.  I may take another OPK today, but am REALLY hoping my temp goes up finally tomorrow.  I feel like then I'll be able to relax a little and just wait.  Yeah right, when have I ever been able to relax while waiting?  I did a little browsing through the chart gallery on Fertility Friend, and it seems like a lot of people ovulate the day after the positive OPK, so I'm not really concerned yet.  I sure hope I get pregnant this cycle.  This has seemed like a lot of work!

       Finally some good news today, no my temperature didn't spike.  I just took the second OPK and this time it was positive, meaning that I should ovulate in the next 24-36 hours.  All I have to say is it's about time!  I'm not sure if that means I'll spike tomorrow or the next day.  Either way, soon, I should be in my 2 week wait.  I'm hoping a long cycle is a good sign for me, I think my last PG cycle was long too!

       I officially have crossed into the land of crazy.  I usually don't get this anxious/anxiety stricken until the 2ww.  This month I'm really concerned that I may not ovulate.  I'm still holding out hope that it's just going to happen later.  I don't really have any reasons not ovulate.  I haven't been under any particular stress, except this last week waiting every day to see if I actually ovulated.  Can be anxious about ovulating, actually keep you from ovulating?  Here are some signs of my obsession: 1.  I have been taking my temperature several times a day, just on the off chance I ovulated sometime during the day and it's on it's way up.   - Why that's bad...The only time your temp means something is first thing in the morning before any outside factors like moving, eating, drinking, showering, etc. can affect it, yet I still have the urge every couple of hours to do it anyway.  At least I can reuse my thermometer, it isn't like taking HPT's twice a day. 2.  I can't go through an evening with Eric without mentioning, my temperatures, how late my O-day is, or what we need to do to get pregnant. - Why that's bad...My DH is of the belief that worry about getting pregnant is a sure fire way to not get pregnant.  Once it becomes my only topic of conversation, he gets annoyed. 3.  I bought my first pack of OPK's tonight.  I was hoping they would help me find my missing O. - Why that's bad...You probably shouldn't start using them on Day 21, but it was negative, so I think I can expect no spike tomorrow.  They were also only $12 for a 5 day supply and came with a bonus HPT, so that's not so bad.  It also gives me some practice at POAS (just added that one to the glossary).    Anyway, this cycle is not that fun anymore.  Read Erica's blog and she's thinking it's not so fun either.  Message to Erica, stick it out and see what happens this month.  Your timing couldn't have been better.  It does take a while for some people, but places like FF I think exagerate that.  I mean people who get PG on the first shot, don't usually make it to the charting and waiting around in TTC chatroom stage.   If you're concerned, I would call the doctor after this cycle.  It's been over 6 months of trying and you have a couple of great charts, so you have something to start with.  I have faith that it will happen eventually.  Don't worry about feeling a little meloncoly about your cycle this month.  I felt the same way last month and also had perfect timing, it really did help take that sting away when AF did show.  On another note.  According to my OPK, I probably won't have a spike tomorrow.  Which means I didn't ovulate today.  If I ovulate tomorrow, and spike on Monday, I will be due to test on 3/9/04.  I think that could be a sign.  If Erica is due to test on my birthday, and I'm due to test on hers, I think we should both get positives, for working it out that way.  I think that would be a great birthday present.

       I've got good news and bad news.  The bad news...still no spike. The good news...still no spike.  That means missing 2 days in a row were not the 2 most important days not to miss.  I had a dream last night.  Eric and I were leaving for a trip to Hawaii.  Our plane was leaving in 1 1/2 hours, but we weren't ready yet.  I was rushing around trying to get all of our stuff together, at first Eric helped me out, but then he got distracted and just sat in the car while I was trying to finish getting ready.  At one point I thought we're never going to make it in time, I should just stop trying, but then thought of how great Hawaii was.  Then I got mad because Eric wasn't helping me.   Dream interpretation...  Hawaii = pregnancy (something really good that I want to do), Trying to get everything ready for the trip = Us doing our part to acheive pregnancy (BD), The fact that there wasn't very much time to get everything done = My anxiety about my O-day being MIA, Eric's originally being helpful and then lack of helpfulness = My hidden anger that last night he fell asleep again instead of trying to help me "get ready".  Being ready to give up = frustration at the missing O and being ready to give up.  It's weird how dreams can do that.  I tend to occasionally have dreams where I get really angy at Eric and just let him have it.  I wonder if that's because I don't tend to get angry that easily when I'm awake?  I understand about last night.  I was really frustrated because I'm afraid we'll miss the window.  Now I'm a little concerned that there may not be a window this month.  I guess we'll see what happens.  I'm a little afraid that this has now crossed the line into being obsessive this month.  Eric's cool about the whole thing until he thinks it's consumed my every waking thought.  Probably not a good sign that the first thing I said to him this morning was, "You're lucky my temperature didn't spike, we still have another chance." Maybe I should have started with "Goodmorning?"

       Highlight of today...Lunch at Tammy's.  Jonathan is so BIG.  He's almost 4 months old.  It feels so good to hold a baby.  Just gotta be patient.  My day will come.  It's been a pretty relaxing evening.  I was exhausted after work, so I came home and took about an hour nap.  I figure it's ok if I can't sleep, because tomorrow is Saturday and I don't have to get up early, so I can stay up as late as I want.  Eric was in a bit of a mood when he came home.  It's been a rough week and he had to stay an extra hour and a half at work tonight to find an accounting error his new employee made before he could make the nightly deposit and come home.  He also said he had a headache, so I sort of steered clear of him and played on the computer.  I'm looking for more cool things for my site.  I had a good chat with Mom tonight too.  I think I'm going to plan a trip to see them in the next couple of months.  It'll be interesting to see how the house is coming.    I just went down to see how Eric was doing and he was asleep on the couch.  I kind of tried to wake him up, but he's not interested in waking up.  That combined with the fact he wasn't in a great mood when he was awake, leads me to believe there may be a disruption to our (strike that - my) BD plans.  I know we've had a busy week, but I'm sure that I'll be o'ing any day now and I think missing 2 days in a row is not the best course of action.  It's a delicate line, I don't want him to feel "used," but timing is kind of important.  I guess I'll try to wake him up one more time, and if not...  If it's meant to be, it will be.    I feel like reading some good blogs.   I may do a search and start linking to people.  For some reason I have the desire to be read by a lot of people.  Maybe I better get a more interesting life.  I read someone's blog that had a Friday 5, where every Friday a group of people answered 5 questions about themselves.  Maybe I'll do that.

       Ok, so I'm getting a little tired of waiting on the big O.  I'm a little concerned, but keep thinking of those long cycles the first time I got pregnant.  It was 35 days after stopping the pill and I did get a negative HPT on CD35 last time I was pregnant, so maybe a long cycle is a good sign!  Another cool thing.  As many of you know, Erica and I were born only 8 days apart.  3/1 and 3/9.  Erica is due to take a test on my birthday 3/1.  If today is my O-day, I will test on 3/7.  So if the O hides out for 2 more days, I would test on Erica's birthday!  I'm hoping it comes sooner than that, but it's still cool.  On another note, I'm so glad it's Friday.  It's been a long week and we have NO plans this weekend.  I just want to veg.

       I learned how to do some new things!  Check out the coolness on my sidebar!  Also, as requested I added the link to the doll maker site, so I didn't "steal" anything.  The other "blinkies" were on free sharing sites although I did upload them to my own server.  I found a free place to store images, so we don't have to take up Chadd's space!  I could stay up all night, but I have to work tomorrow.

       Just thought I should put another entry in.  I'm stilll in the pre-o stage, but am really hoping that today is the day and tomorrow I spike (actually that's been the hope for the last several days).  The first month I charted I o'd on day 19, so I'm still in my "historical" window.  That's not to say it couldn't happen later than that, but so far it's not abnormal.  Not much else to say except still waiting.  Oh yeah, my CM issue has cleared up a little I had EWCM both CD17 & 18 (not sure about today yet), I guess the fact that I haven't o'd yet, explains why I hadn't had any back on day 16, it was just too early.  I'm tired of trying to guess when O will happen, I just hope it happens soon (so I can wait for another 2 weeks, 16 days to be exact, to see if I can take an HPT.)  Gotta get ready for work.  Hopefully, there will be a good update tomorrow.

       Still no spike.  The look of pain on Eric's face this morning, when I told him.  He just doesn't think he's cut out to be a rabbit.

       I'm looking for my spike soon.  I'm hoping maybe tomorrow.  I have o'd on day 16 for the last 2 months, so I'm hoping it's the same this time.  My temp was down at 97.0 this morning, and it probably doesn't mean anything, but I took my temp this afternoon (around 5:30 p.m.) and it was 98.5, now that was right after I got back from the gym and took a hot shower, but still....  If I do spike tomorrow, I'll feel pretty good about the timing, we'll have gotten 3 days in a row in.  Last month was perfect too, so who knows.  This cycle is weird though, my temps have been all over the place, I think I'm looking for a 97.9 for a spike.  Technically, the highest temp over the past 6 days is 97.4, so 97.6 would be a spike, but I've had 3 temps that high this cycle, so I'd rather see something a little closer to 98.0.  My CM pattern is really weird too, I've only had 1 true day of EWCM (Friday, which we didn't take advantage of).  I'm not sure what that means, if I am going to ovulate later this month or if I just don't have much.  Kind of hard to analyze now.  I guess I'll just see what happens.  By the way, Erica has a beautiful chart this month.  Her temps are so stable.  She ovulated a little later than expected, but it looks like a definate ovulation pattern.  Her BD timing was also great, so I'm hoping that something come of it.  It's been 7 months, that seems like a long enough wait.  Interesting thought, Erica is  2CD ahead of me, with her not Oing until day 16 and her LP is 14 days, if I O on day 16 with a 12 day LP, we technically will be due for AF at the same time.  We'll have to see if we end up testing together.

       Ok, I had to add this urlLink  link .  I was surfing the web looking for some other trying to concieve journals and someone had a link to this guy's website for a Valentine's day "perfect man."  In case you don't want to visit the site, here are a few of my favorite quotes.  This guy is a freak.  He wants, "2 - 6 women to have 2 - 15 children by me."  Here's his timeframe: February through April - Promote web-site. Receive responses. Begin initial selection.  Mid-May - Complete initial selection. Complete respectful notification of those not selected. Request further information from those initially selected.  May through July - Receive additional information. Correspond to become better acquainted. Possible personal meetings.  Mid-August - Final selection  Here's one of his preferences, "If your vision uncorrected - either by lens or by surgery - were normal or you were farsighted up to perhaps +5 or +6 diopters, this would be a definite plus.  "I would like to have 17 children. Why 17? I don't know. It just seems like a good number to have. I didn't say this earlier in the web-site because I didn't want to scare you away right off the bat."  "Our tractor would have an enclosed cab. "  "Harvesting our wheat, beans, and potatoes in the fall would require a lot of work, but I think we could do it. "  " I would prefer, when we were working outside, that you use such items of clothing, etc. that would prevent you from becoming roughed up and weather-beaten. "  "Shoes would be left in the entranceway."  "Everyone in the household would keep a baseball bat under their bed to deal with possible burglars, intruders, and trespassers. "  He sounds like a real winner.  I think I'm lucky I got my man.

       I'm about ready to head to bed on Valentine's Day night (for sleeping).  I thought I'd do a mini recap of the first part of the weekend.  Friday night I came straight home after work because we had tickets to the very first home game of the Columbus Destroyers.  That's the new Arena Football Team in Columbus.  We bought season tickets and this was the first game.  Our neighbor Martin bought a ticket to the game too, so he rode with us, but our seats weren't together so we didn't see him again until the end of the game.  It was pretty exciting, although they lost.  The other team scored with 2 seconds left to win the game.  That took up all of Friday night.  Today was really busy although I didn't get much done in the way of domestic chores.  Eric and I slept in a until about 9:30 a.m.   Then he went to work and I went to the gym, where I must say I made up my cardio I skipped on Friday, plus did lower body and abs.  After I got back from the gym I picked up lunch and wrote my receipts for the week in the checkbook.  We had an appointment to do our taxes at 1:00 p.m.  We were there until 3:30 p.m.  It took along time, because they did the return both filing jointly and separately, and we determined that we'd get back about $450 more if we filed separately.  We're pretty happy about out tax return as we'll be getting back about $4000.  Get to make some major payments on some bills.  After taxes we came home showered and dressed and then decided to go to Outback for dinner.  We got there at 5:15 p.m. to put our names in for a 2 hour wait.  Then we left and went to Blockbuster to get a movie and went and walked around Bed, Bath, & Beyond.  We then went back to the restaurant to wait some more.   We got in at about 7:30 p.m. and had dinner.  After dinner we came home and watched our movie "Out of Time" with Denzel Washington.  Good movie.  That's about it.  We just bought each other cards and stupid little stuffed animals for V-Day.  Neither of us really saw the need to go out and spend tons of money.  We love each other all year long, we don't need a "Hallmark Holiday" to tell us to do something special.  Not much going on yet on the baby front.  My CM pattern makes me think it may still be a couple of days until O-day.  I'm trying not to focus on that too much.  All the plans are nice, but right now I think it's more important to focus on the big picture.  It'll happen when the time is right, although we've only got one more month if we want it to be a tax deduction next year!  I'm off Monday, so I still get too more days of weekend!  Yippee!  I'm also going back on BFL tomorrow.  Boy do I need it.

       Well, the first thing out of Eric's mouth this morning was I'm sorry.  He said he woke up at about 2:00 a.m. and realized he missed his chance.  Oh, well, we'll have to work on it tonight after we get home from the neighbors.  We always go over to their house on Thursdays to watch Friends, Survivor, The Apprentice, CSI, and ER using TiVo.  Last week we skipped ER because it got to late, we may have to this week too because of the "Operation Rabbit" plans.

       Just thought I'd say that so far my "Operation Rabbit" plan is not working.  It was supposed to go into effect tonight, but my husband is not cooperating.  He decided this would be a good evening to fall asleep on the couch at 7:30 p.m.  He does that about once every two weeks.  Anyway, I am about ready for bed and he shows no sign of waking up before morning.  All I can say is that it's a good thing I'm still in the "sticky" phase.  He knew the plans tonight, seriously, how important is sleep?   So you don't know what "Operation Rabbit" is?  I didn't want to be too graphic, but I bet if you think about the nature of rabbits, you can figure it out.  Hint. Hint.

       This turned into a really good weekend.  I thought I'd give you a full recap for the record.  To start, I've been feeling really "blah" since I took an entire week off of my diet.  I feel so yucky though, that I can't wait to get up tomorrow and have a fresh start.  Here's how my weekend went down.  Friday - Came straight home from work and totally skipped any workout.  I'm not sure what I did until about 7:30 p.m., but it probably involved computer games.  Then Eric and I decided to order a pizza.  I order from Pizza Hut  urlLink online  and it said that the pizza would be delivered in about 30 minutes.  After an hour had went by I decided to call and see what was up.  Apparently the internet sent our order to the wrong store, which doesn't deliver here, so they cancelled our order.  Nice, didn't even call.  The plus side, the guy on the phone rerouted our order to the appropriate store and gave it to us free, but we had to wait another hour for delivery.  But hey, free pizza!  I kind of felt bad for the delivery guy, because I was planning to pay via debit card and had no cash for a tip.  Anyway, we also watched Titanic, amazingly it was Eric's idea.  Saturday - I slept in which was wonderful and then planned on meeting Samara at the mall at about 1:00 p.m. for some shopping.  I had an appointment at the day spa to get my eyebrows waxed at 12:30 p.m. and then we hooked up to do some shopping.  We had dinner reservations and wanted to get something new to wear.  We ended up shopping until the last possible momement, but both ended up with sexy/hot outfits.  Mine was from the Limited and I got a very sexy black top and some winter white slacks.  It's cool because I can wear the pants to work, so it's not a one time deal.  I also wore the boots I bought in Chicago (2nd time) and can I say my calves certainly aren't getting smaller.  I also bought another pair of pants and top that is appropriate for work.  Samara got this sexy satin lacy blouse and a skirt.  We were definately hot mommas.  We then went back to my place and changed for dinner (the guys were waiting).  We had dinner reservations at 7:30 p.m. at Cameron's and dinner was great (expensive, but great).  I got the "special" soup, some kind of spicy potato, followed by the Grilled Filet Mignon.  It was great, also served with Garlic Mashed Potatos, asparagas, a portabella french fry, and a rich port wine sauce.  I ate every bite.  I also got creme broule for dessert.  Very tasty.  Sunday - I made plans to go to church with April, but Eric said he would possibly join me, so I decided to drive separately.  I got up at about 9:00 which really felt like sleeping in, and asked Eric if he was going.  He decided to sleep in and I got ready.  I was running a little late so got to the service right when it was starting and slipped in and sat on the side.  I saw April a few minutes later and waved, but ended up sitting by myself.  It was the first new Praise & Worship service for the church.  It was nice, but apparently a very new type of service for this church.  For me it just felt like home.  I knew it had to be good when I was disappointed when the sermon was over.  I thought he could have talked a little more.  He was discussing evolution a bit, and I find that debate fascinating.  Then I headed up to Sunday School and again had a good time.  They are discussing the Apostles Creed, which I don't think I've ever read, but really dug into what every word really means.  I like those deep discussions sometimes much more than being preached at.  All in all a good day.  After I got home it's been the normal go to the grocery store, do laundry, etc.  So that was my weekend, doesn't sound like much, but felt really good.  I just wish it wasn't over tomorrow.  I have a work meeting that I'm kind of dreading.  Oh well, it'll be over soon enough.

       Not a whole lot happening yet.  I had a really good weekend with our Superbowl party.  We ended up having 9 people over and had way too much food.  That was the beginning of the end for me.  I stuffed myself and it was not a pretty sight.  Then I tried to get back on the diet track on Monday.  I did fine at work, but by the time I was ready to go home, I had no intention of going to the gym.  I had to have chocolate and wanted it NOW!  I ended up eating about 4 slices of pizza, a king size Hershey's with Almonds, a couple handfuls of Goldfish crackers, and a whole pint of Ben & Jerry's cookie dough ice cream.  I think PMS hit with a vengence.  I made sure to indulge.  I'm trying to do better now, because that did not do good things to my diet and I'd rather not destroy a month's work of weight loss in a 4-day binge just because it's that time of the month.  This can't happen every month or I'm doomed.  I'm hoping February will be a good month.  I could find out I'm pregnant within days after my birthday, so that would be cool.  If the baby doesn't happen, I hope it's a good month in other ways.  We're a month into the new year and I haven't done all that great on my resolutions.  Dieting was one of them, and I'd done good on that until this weekend and this week.  I also said I'd be going back to church and haven't made it yet, I'm planning on going this week though, so hopefully, that will get me back on track there.  Does it ever seem like you spend your whole life trying to catch up and get "back on track"?  I guess if we were always on top of things, we wouldn't have a chance to grow.  That's what I want to do. Grow.  That should be my new goal.  Whatever happens this year, I want it to make me a better person.

       Yesterday was a fluke, but AF did arrive today.  Arriving today, officially gives me a 12 day lutal phase.  That makes me happy.  All the same positive feelings as yesterday, with a correction that Erica and I are now 2 days apart.  Glad it happened this morning, so I don't have to sit around all day waiting.  Now if these cramps would just go away....

       I'm not using last names so I figure I can post the  urlLink baby   urlLink pictures .  He's so cute and tiny.  And I barely thought about the fact that my baby was supposed to be born first (really). I suppose it helps that my "due date" isn't for another 3 weeks.  (Malachi was born 4 weeks early).  Anyway, Kim looked great today and was up and about and Malachi was so perfect.  He was in the NicU on an IV for low blood sugar, but they think they can both go home on Friday.  Ok, time for bed.

       Kim from my office had her baby today!  His name is Malachi and he was born at 4:00 p.m. via C-Section.  He weighs 4 pounds and 7 ounces.  I'll get to go visit tomorrow!  Kim wasn't scheduled for her C-Section until 4/21, but at her doctor's appointment today they thought that her amniotic fluid might be getting low, so they went ahead and did it.  She was at about 36 weeks pregnant.  Congrats to Kim and baby Malachi!

       This was such a wonderful weekend.  I think the Spring weather is really helping my mood, although I didn't spend much time outside.  Friday after work I had to go to the gym because I didn't get up early.  Then I came home made dinner and pretty muched vegged out on the couch.  I went to bed at about 11 p.m.  Saturday I got up at about 9:00 a.m. and did my domestic duties.  I did all the laundry and cleaned the house.  Saturday night we had plans to go out to dinner with a woman Eric works with and her husband (who he plays paintball with) for the husband's birthday.  We went to dinner at 7 at House of Japan.  It was my first experience at a Japanese steakhouse (although it is on the agenda for the upcoming GWO) and I'm looking forward to it with my girls.  After dinner we went back to Mike and Brandy's house and they had a bit of a party going on.  There were about 15 people and some people were playing cards, there was lots of good music and one girl even brought over her Karioke equimpent (don't worry, I didn't sing).  At about 11:30 p.m. we all left and headed to Rackum's a sports bar that has a dance floor and plays hip hop/rap music.  It was so much fun because I got to dance.  I never thought I was much good at it, but I love to dance and as I've gotten older care a whole lot less about whether I "look good" doing it.  Eric has some moves too, so it was fun.  Bizarre as it was, another guy Eric plays paintball with got ditched by his wife earlier in the evening (she took off with some girl friends to go to some other bar).  Anyway, this guy asked Eric if he could dance with me.  I guess he was bored and just wanted to dance.  So, I danced with him and while we were out there, some drunk guys were checking me out and this guy got all protective.  It's kind of nice to be admired, but in the end I'm glad I'm there with Eric.  He is so cool about it.  He totally trusts me in any situation and doesn't get jealous when other guys think I'm attractive too.  We stayed until about 1:30 a.m. and then headed home.  Sunday, we got up for church and enjoyed it as always.  I think we may have found us a permanent place.  We've even started tithing every week (still not the 10% rule, but we're giving something).  After church, we came home, I made my meal plans for next week and watched a little Nascar with Eric.  Then I took a nap with the windows open and the sping breeze.  It was heavenly.  The rest of the afternoon, I went grocery shopping and then get ready to fall out of your chairs... I worked on my GWO scrapbook.  I just got the invitation for GWO IV and it said to bring, "completed" scrapbooks.  I think that comment was aimed at me, so I'm going to have it done.  I did the pages for the first 2 and now just have the most recent one to complete.  I need to print off some pictures first.  I still have a lot to do this week, and I'm leaving Thursday afternoon for Iowa to visit my parents, but am hoping this will be a productive week.  Oh yeah, I also managed to pull off a perfect week of dieting and missing no workouts (You can read more about that in  urlLink My Fitness Blog .  So, here's where I'm at as far as ovulation goes.  I'm 99% sure it's happened.  Since I'm not temping, I'm not exactly sure when, but my guess is either Thursday, Friday or Saturday, most likely Friday.  I've been watching my CM and Thursday was my last day of fertile CM (we took advantage too, so we'll see how that works).  TCOYF says that ovulation usually occurs the day of or the day after your Peak Day (the last day of fertile quality cervical fluid).  That would be either Thursday or Friday.  Today is the first day I have sore breasts.  Last month the BT (Breast Tenderness) started the day after I ovulated.  The month before, it started the day of.  It's possible they were a little sore yesterday, but I didn't know if I was imagining it, today there is no question.  Using the 2 indicators, I estimate Friday.  I suppose it isn't all that important, but that would put AF due between 4/7 and 4/9.  I was planning on testing on 4/9, I think I'll still keep to that.  It'll be Good Friday and that would be a Good Friday.  Good thing I have a trip to a Day Spa and a visit to my parents to keep me busy until then.

       This is the story of the grand tradition between my best friends of a quarterly Girls Weekend Out (GWO).  Here's how it came about....  Once upon a time, two little girls were born as cousins and grew up together in the same small town (although they went to different schools).  We'll call them Erica and Danialle.  They were as close as cousins can be.  The younger of the cousins, Erica went to the same high school as a girl called Jennifer.  Erica and Jennifer became friends through a series of common interests including playing on the high school softball team and having the same after-school job at Wal-Mart.  Growing up in the same town and being friends with Erica, Jennifer on occasion had met Danialle, but didn't know her well enough to consider her a friend.  After high school, as often happens, people go their separate ways and grow apart, although strangly enough Erica and Jennifer became  closer  friends and made a point to keep in touch through e-mail, phone calls, and the occasional get together, usually around their birthdays (Erica and Jennifer are only 9 days apart in age).  Jennifer went away to college and made some new friends.  One of these friends was Heather.  They were in the same major, in many of the same extra-curricular activities, and became very close.  Heather was always there to listen when Jennifer had problems (and Jennifer would return the favor), and Heather even introduced Jennifer to the man she would eventually marry.  As the college years were winding down, Jennifer decided to get married.  Two of her bridesmaids were Erica, her highschool friend, and Heather, her college friend.  Through the wedding Heather and Erica met and very quickly became friends with each other (independent of their joint friendship with Jennifer).    After college, Jennifer moved to a new state, however, still kept in touch with both Heather and Erica.  About a year later, Erica met the man of her dreams and decided she would get married too.  Two of her bridesmaids were Danialle, her favorite cousin, and Jennifer, her highschool friend.  As bridesmaids, there are many important responsibilities including planning the bachelorette party.  Through making these plans, Danialle and Jennifer spent many hours of e-mails and plan-making and became great friends independantly of their friendship with Erica.  Then at the Bachelorette party, Heather was invited and met Danialle.  They also instantly hit it off and there were these four girls who had an amazing time together and luckily realized how special this could be.  After the bachelorette party the girls wanted a way to be sure that this friendship would never be lost.  Seeing each other in person is an important part of the equation.  So they decided to get together every 3 months or so in a different host city to reconnect and have "girl time" a Girls Weekend Out.  GWO would go on regardless of changes in marital status, children being born, etc.  The first of these GWO excursions was in Chicago, Danialle's city.  It was a huge success and the next GWO was immediately planned.  GWO II was in Terre Haute, Indiana and was equally as successful.    GWO III was in Columbus, OH, Jennifer's city and brought the newest addition to the GWO group.  When Jennifer moved to Columbus, she was fortunate enough in the first 6 months or so, to meet a person who was to be her best friend.  Being in a city away from your friends and family is difficult, but Samara made it ok, as she now had a person locally to laugh and cry with.  Fortunately their husbands got along too, so it was perfect.  Samara joined the group in Columbus, and Erica, Danialle, and Heather couldn't help but love her too.  So now our GWO group sits at 5 members (although, I don't think we'll ever permantently close the door to new members) and GWO IV is just a few very short weeks away, in Lafayette, Indiana, Erica's city.  What is so great about this group, this tradition, is unconditional love.  I love when we get together and immensely look forward to every trip that is coming up.  It isn't about shopping or partying, or being without guys, although we do all of those things.  It's about being together.  We can look past each other's imperfections and offer support and therapy for each other's souls.  It doesn't matter to us if your thigh's jiggle (or look like a supermodel's).  We don't care if you are "on" or "off" your diet.  We don't care if you are PMSing or if everything is going perfect.  We are there for each other.  This group has already been through a lot together.  We met through a wedding.  Four of us are married and one is single.  Two of us are in the process of trying for children (although it's taking both longer than expected).  One is in school working on a master's degree (while working a full time job, teaching).  One of us has had plastic surgery (hence the supermodel leg reference).  One of us has had a miscarriage.  One of us had to watch her baby sister get pregnant and have a miscarriage while trying for a baby of her own.  One of us has had to deal with her sister being addicted to Heroin and being in a rehab facility for a year.  One of us had to watch her brother go to Iraq while he left a pregnant wife at home to give birth without him.  One of us has lost several extended family members this year.  But through it all, we've stayed friends and have always got each other.  I feel blessed and priviledged to know and be able to call each of them friends.  We're working on a motto, "Through rain or snow, married or single, near or far, children or lack of, tears or laughter, miscarriages, surgeries, depression, death of loved ones, births, new homes, and new careers...we will be friends.  Forever, GWO will go on."  Maybe it still needs some work, but the point is.  I love my friends and hope we we all be friends forever.

       Just did a sneak peek at my temperature (in the evening, after a workout).  It was 97.5, so I'm pretty sure I haven't O'd yet.  Don't know if that's good or bad, but at least I know.

       Last Friday we had Kim's shower from work and Monday she was supposed to find out when her C-section would be scheduled.  Well, apparently the doctor's think work is too stressful, so she's off work until the baby's born.  Now I have to find a way to get my cross-stich back.  Also, they scheduled her C-section for 4/21.  I bet I'll get to go visit that afternoon or the next day.  We're good about that around here.

       Did my renewal presentation today and think it went pretty well.  I even got to do most of the talking and both Pete, my boss, and the Client Executive said I did a good job explaining all of the coverages.  I'm hoping that I'll stop getting daily headaches now for a while.  It's been a rough two weeks.  I know I said I'm not charting (and I haven't been temping), but now that I'm "educated" there are certain signals I notice about my body and one is CM.  I have tons of the good kind today, so I think it may be getting close.  Hopefully, we'll take advantage tonight.  We were going to last night, but I had a killer migraine, and it's been a couple days, so tonight wouldn't be out of our ordinary schedule.  Eric is working late though, so it'll just depend on his mood when he gets home.  I don't want to push the issue.  I also feel like I'm doing pretty good on BFL, I am heading to my Fitness blog to update there for now.

       Thought I'd do a quick recap of the weekend before I leave for work.  Friday - Just hung out. Saturday - Re-read Body for Life book, set some goals, printed out 84 days worth of food and exercise plans, planned my first week of meals Sunday - Went to church in the AM, had lunch at Steak & Shake, bought a new Mini-disk player (so Eric and I don't fight over his), did the grocery shopping, recorded some tunes for workout onto the Mini-disks, took before pictures, dinner at April & Martins  Doesn't soundlike a lot, but I feel productive.  I'm re-starting BFL and I mean it.  I even went to the gym at 6:30 this morning.    I also wanted to say "I'm sorry" to  urlLink Erica .  Looks like Month 8 is a bust for her.  Maybe you'll get some good info out of your tests last week and this week and I would maybe consider quitting charting for a month or two.  It's been good for me.  About charting, I'm having an internal debate on what to do next month.  The Pros of Charting: 1.  I'll know exactly where I am in my cycle and have more data to take to the Doctor for my April 30th appointment.  The Pros of Not Charting:  1.  I'm made a spiritual decision to leave this in God's hands for his timing.  It's much easier for me not to "obsess" and just wait if I'm not really tracking everything.  2.  I think I can focus on BFL a whole lot better if I'm not taking up so much time analyzing my charts.  I'm really leaning towards not charting, but just wonder if it's more valuable to have info for the doctor.  Maybe I'll just chart next month and then see what she says and stop again?  I don't know.  Ok, better leave for work or I'll be late.

       So I'm looking for something to pass the time at work (like I have nothing to do, but hey, it's Friday).  Here's what I came up with.  What if Erica is pregnant? - Her due date would be December 2, 2004 - She would be approximately 8 weeks pregnant at GWO IV - Her first doctor's appointment would be around May 6, 2004 - She would be 20 weeks on July 17th.  20 weeks is about the time you learn the sex of the baby, so she could know before GWO V in July what the sex is. - She would be 33 weeks on October 14th, 2004.  Good thing October is in Indiana because at that stage you should start staying closer to home. - The baby would be about 8 weeks old at the end of January.  GWO VII in Columbus could be moved to February and we could discuss bringing baby along.  What if I get pregnant this month? - Due date would be December 14, 2004 - based on LMP, but with my cycles probably more like 12/16-12/19 (can you say Christmas baby?) - I would be approximately 6 weeks at GWO IV - First doctor's appointment would be around May 18, 2004 - Would be 20 weeks on 7/27 - My doctor doesn't do ultrasounds around then, so I could possibly go and have one done at around 18 weeks in time to find out before GWO V - Would be 31 weeks on October 12th.  Still enough time to travel to Indiana for GWO VI ! - Baby would be 6 weeks at end of January.  Jen still on maternity leave to host GWO VII?  What if I get pregnant next month? - Assume AF arrives on 4/9/04. - Due date would be approximately 1/14/05 - Would be ovulating immediately following GWO IV. - First doctor's appoinment 6/18 - Approximately 14 weeks at July GWO V.  That's enough to start showing! - 20 weeks at 8/27/04. - Late January/ Early February GWO would have very small baby 2-4 weeks.  Erica could bring hers!  GWO in early January could put me into labor!

       If you...   1. ...owned a restaurant, what kind of food would you serve?   Probably an american bar & grill (something like Applebees, Friday's, Champps).  Eric's always said he would like to own a pub in retirement years, but I'm not especially fond of pubs.   2. ...owned a small store, what kind of merchandise would you sell?   I always wanted to do wedding planning, but that isn't really merchandise.  Probably books.   3. ...wrote a book, what genre would it be?   I could see me writing a romance novel or a kind of day in the life book (like print my blog)   4. ...ran a school, what would you teach?   Math.  Algebra, Geometry, Accounting, Calculus, etc.   Anything with numbers.  I'm better at explaning certainties than more abstract subjects.   5. ...recorded an album, what kind of music would be on it?   That's a tough one.  I'm not really musically inclined.  It's probably be a "Worst of" album.  I don't sing well. - Definately wouldn't be country.

       I don't really have much to update about, but felt like writing anyway.  I just finished watching American Idol.  It's weird, I watch every episode, but never vote.  What else is going on?  I've been having my headaches.  One yesterday and today that needed my Imitrex.  Over the last 5 months that I've been paying attention to my cycles I've learned a pattern to my headaches.  I usually get about 2 that need medication the week after my period.  Usually between CD5-9.  Luckily, that is a "safe" time to medicate, since my regular doctor told me not to take Imitrex while trying to get pregnant as it's not in the "safe" category.  I won't take it after ovulation.  Here's my delima. My prescription is out of refills and I only have 1 more pill left.  I saw my regular doctor in July and he didn't give me any more refills because I told him I was trying to get pregnant.  I'm debating on whether I need to schedule another appointment and see if I can convince him to give me a refill if I promise not to take it when I could be pregnant.  The downside to that is I already have my annual OB/GYN appointment at the end of April and I'm not sure if it will look weird to have 2 doctors appointments in a month (to work people).  Also, I really despise my doctor.  I guess this would be a good time to look into switching my primary physician, but wonder if that would be weird to go to a new doctor to try to get drugs.  I will probably just suck it up and go see the doctor I hate, get my refill, and then switch doctors.  Not much else to say.  Not charting seems to leave me with a lack of things to discuss babywise.  I'm really looking at this as a month off of trying, although it will be interesting to see if Eric trys to time things.  Kim from my office has her shower on Friday.  I'm looking forward to that, although I still need to go by a frame for the baby thing I cross-stiched for her.    One more thing.  I don't think I mentioned this before, but about two weeks ago, I found out another woman in my office is pregnant.  I feel bad admitting it, but when I heard, I was insanely jealous.  Here's the story.  She didn't know she was pregnant at the time, but ended up going to the hospital and having emergency surgery for an etopic pregnancy the day I had my D&C.  It was kind of strange that two pregnancies ended the same day in our office.  I don't really know this woman, we just say hello in passing, etc.  About two weeks ago I overheard her tell someone that she was 12 weeks along.  She must have gotten pregnant again pretty quickly.  I'm not sure why it made me feel so bad.  She had a bad time of it too, and definately deserves a healthy happy pregnancy.  Her getting pregnant in no way affects my ability to do the same, but I guess it just was hard to see someone who had a pregnancy end the same time as me get her happy ending (or beginning) first.  It really made me feel horrible that my first feeling was a negative one.  I certainly would want people to be happy for me when I get pregnant again.  I am happy for her now, it just makes me feel a little sad at the same time.  Today was the first day she wore maternity clothes.  Why is that harder for me to deal with than planning the shower at work for the baby that is due a week after mine should have been?  I guess the pain comes back in unexpected ways.  Another thing, an intern in my office stopped by my cube to chat today.  She's really sweet.  She's 22 a college senior, etc.  She of course knew about the first pregnancy, etc.  Today she asked me how everything was going in the baby department.  I said no luck yet, and she asked if I was trying.  I said yes.  She asked why it was taking so long.  Good question.  (That's one way to know she's still just a kid, most people wouldn't think to ask someone they knew was trying to get pregnant why it's taking so long.)  Obviously, we're trying, but I think I need to accept that the time must not be right.  I wouldn't wish a loss on anyone, but the waiting this time is certainly helping me keep things in perspective.  Being a parent is serious business, and honestly the idea still terrifies me at times.  I thought I was ready again immediately, but every month that goes by makes me realize how special it really is.  When the time is right, I will cherish every moment.  I hope I don't have to wait that much longer, but have faith that God knows when the right time for me is.  That's why all the charting and timing and planning haven't worked yet.  I can't say when the time is right, I just have to have faith, that someday it will be.  Well, that's enough for now considering I had nothing to write about when I started.  Whew.  I'm getting a little mushy.

       It's not been a very productive time off although I have almost conquered Tetris Worlds.  I also read The Hobbit, cleaned my house, did laundry including the sheets, and listened to 2 new CDs.  I was pretty caught up at work on Wednesday, so it will be interesting to see how far behind I am tomorrow.  I have one of my clients renewals at the end of the month and I left a quote deadline of Friday, so hopefully I have some numbers waiting patiently in my inbox at work and can put together a proposal tomorrow.  Things to do this week on a personal level.  Check in with my friend H. who was having surgery at  the end of last week.  Check in with Erica to see if they started the semen analysis and her tests start this Friday.  Also, I need to check in with Samara since we didn't talk at all last week.  My brother stayed this week and I kind of stayed holed up and oblivious to the outside world.  I also need to seriously put some work into studying for my CPCU, that test will sneak up on me before I know it.  I'd like to work on the GWO scrapbook.  Tuesday night I get to go shopping for Kim's shower (work friend) with the office money contribution.  Wednesday, we're moving Survivor night due to the NCAA tournament.  This could be a busy week.   Oh yes, must also conquer Tetris Worlds.  I hear it calling me now...  (At least I'm playing games rather than reading trying to conceive blogs.  I actually had to look at a calendar to see what cycle day I'm on.)

       I've been on vacation for 2 days and it's been great.  Been kind of lazy which is nice and did some shopping yesterday that's been keeping me busy.  I bought Tetris Worlds for the computer and it's been taking up a lot of time.  I also figured I might eventually need to read the Lord of the Rings books.  I do enjoy reading and know that books are better than movies, so figure since I enjoyed the movies, I better get the real story and read the books.  I bought The Hobbit for $10.50 and the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in one volume for $18.00 at Target.  I'm about half way through The Hobbit.  It's better than I remember.  I remember trying to read it when I was about 10 and just got bored.  Today we went to the 12:45 p.m. showing of The Passion of the Christ.  I'd read some reviews and heard from friends who'd seen it and honestly was a little disappointed.  I think it was an excellent movie for showing the suffering of Christ and really gets to you to think of what a sacrifice dying for us really was, but I don't think that the movie will really touch many non-believers.  Except for a few flashbacks of things that happened in his life (a couple of sermons, the last supper, etc.) most of the movie just focused on his arrest, trial, and death.  I don't think the movie did a great job of showing "why" did he have to die for us.  Also, there was only one seen of "ressurrection" which is really the biggest miracle of all.  Anybody could die, but the fact that he rose again is the real miracle.  Anyway, I'm glad I saw it and thought the part of the story that was told was good, but felt it would have been a better "message" if it ventured more into why he had to die, his teachings, and what happened after he rose from the dead.  On a completely different note, I've kind of enjoyed not taking my temperature the last few days.  Partially because I've been sleeping in and don't have to wake up at 6:00 to take my temperature.  I suppose it's also easier since I know it's too early for anything to happen.  Not sure how I'll do in the next couple of weeks.

       I'm not very fun to be around right now.  I feel a little sorry for the guys in my house today (my brother's in town for his Spring Break).  For no real reason, I got angry the moment I came home from work.  The guys were on the couch watching a movie and I had to clean up the kitchen and make dinner.  I think it was the fact that I had to work all day and then still do my normal household chores while they slept until noon and played video games and watched movies.  I know it's irrational.  Eric's on vacation and Jeremy's on Spring Break.  I don't really like Eric to do the housework and it wasn't like they'd trashed the place.  I just had to unload the dishwasher and put the rest of last night's dinner dishes in and get out the hamburger for dinner.  What did I expect?  It's just frustrating when you completely know your being hormonal and irrational, but still just want to scream at someone for not knowing that you would want to order Pizza rather than make dinner when you asked what they wanted to eat.  It's crazy that you know your being crazy, but are powerless to calm your emotions.  Eric figured it out though when I started hitting on him.  Apparently that's my other signal that AF is here.   Oh well, it'll pass and hopefully, sooner rather than later, I can get rid of these symptoms for a while.  Although, I'm not sure that pregnancy hormones are any better.  At least then you get something good out of it.

       I think I'm becoming a post-aholic.  This is number 3 for today.  Oh well, I enjoy reading my friends, so I'm assuming my readers prefer more updates to less.    AF has still not arrived, but I have been having minor cramps.  Nothing worthy of any ibuprofin or other pain relief, but still enough to make me believe that there was a reason my temps dropped.  Now if AF doesn't arrive over night or immediately upon awakening, I think I will use up one of my tests, just to erase the last shred of hope for this month.  Now, about my title.  I've decided how to approach next month.  Several people have mentioned to me that they think all of my charting, etc. has caused me stress, and maybe I should just "relax."  My husband included.  Personally, I still don't agree that I'm more stressed.  I will say I'm more aware and educated about my body.  Also, from everything I've read, the only role stress plays on your cycle is possibly delaying ovulation and by my charts I'm obviously ovulating, so I don't think not "relaxing" is the issue here.  However, we weren't charting last time we got pregnant, and somehow hit the window.  I'm going to take this month off from the obsessive need to monitor every signal and just see what happens.  Of course, if this is the month that works, everyone will probably say "I told you so!"  I guess I'll just have to remember that if there is a 20-25% chance of conceiving in any one cycle (assuming no fertility problems), we've got a decent shot at getting it done in 5 months, regardless of my charting or not.  And if we get pregnant, we met the goal right? (At least the first part, the final goal is actually giving birth to a healthy baby).  Who really cares what method got us there.  I was going to keep charting until I see my OB/GYN for my annual exam at the end of April, but figure, I've got 4 complete months already, if #5 doesn't work, I'll at least know how long the cycle was, and can start charting #6 before my appointment.  4 1/2 charts should be enough for her to work with or at least say, "Yep, your doing it right.  Keep trying."    Here's the actual strategy.  I will on my calendar, keep track of my LMP date (obviously if successful, the doc will want to know this).  I will also keep track of the days we BD.  If we have to help determine conception to get the date right, it'd be nice to know possibilities.  I'm going to let Eric take the lead on the trying.  We'll BD when he wants and I won't get crazy about hitting any possible windows, etc.  Enough babies are made accidently, that with our "normal" activity, I'd think we've got a pretty good shot (although, it seems like we've had good timing the last 4 months too).  Since I've had 3 cycles of 31 days (including the one after my D&C that we didn't try), 1 of 28 days, and 1 of 37?, I'll allow myself to start testing at 32 days.  I won't really know if I'm late, but it seems reasonable.  It'll be interesting to see if this strategy has a shot.  We've already tried the every other day thing, the every day thing, the 15 times in one month thing, why not just try the old fashioned, we'll see what happens approach.  The key will be to see if I can actually remain stress free, when I don't have a clue what my body is doing.  I'll just have to remember, it didn't exactly work when I did know what it was doing.  Here's to cycle #5!  I'm ready whenever you are.

       So still no AF.  What are the chances that the temp was a fluke?  Probably not good, but for some reason I can't seem to let go of the last thread of hope.    Still no AF symptoms.  No cramps, still have a sore chest, not really hungry for junk, and obviously still missing the most critical indicator that AF is here.  I'll let you in on a little secret.  I went a little crazy yesterday and went out and bought the absolute cheapest HPT I could find.  I bought 2 for $7 and took one yesterday afternoon.  I didn't see any lines, but went back and looked at it later and could almost convince myself I saw a VERY and I mean VERY faint line.  I showed it to Eric and he saw it too.  So I was really excited to wake up today and take another one with the first mornining urine and an EPT which is probably more sensitive.  Well, my temps plunged, so I didn't test this morning, but that glimmer of a possible line is making it really difficult to let go of the hope.  I just wish things would get started already, so I could move along.  If AF doesn't come tonight I may test again tomorrow morning just to seal the deal.  Taking a test tends to encourage AF to show, so maybe that's a good thing.

       I didn't test this morning.  My temp was only 97.4.  I took it again just in case, nope, still too low.  I haven't seen AF yet.  I know it's not over until the fat lady sings, but I'm pretty sure I've got front row tickets to her next performance.  Sigh...  I guess we'll see what next month has to bring.  I'm not sure what the strategy is.  I'm really not in the mood right now.  Oh well, I guess I better go to work.  Life goes on, right?

       For now, I've removed my blog roll until I can figure out why it's causing problems.  Today, I feel very "not pregnant."  I'm not sure what's different.  My temperature was still 98.0, I went to the grocery store and had a strange craving for sweet pickles, my breasts still hurt, I still don't have any cramps or other impending AF symptoms.  Yet, I feel like it's coming to an end.  That's a bit sad.  I'm not really in the mood to start another month.  This one has just been so long.  Maybe I'm wrong.  I'll take another test in the morning if my temps don't drop.  I hope I'm wrong, but I don't think so.  And by the way...I will start another month and we'll give it another try.  I'm still doing 2 more cycles before taking a break.  I'm pretty sure I'll be ready for one.

       Ok, so I have now added the following in the last 12 hours. 1.  Comments 2.  A Hit Counter 3.  A Blog Roll (automatic list of blogs I read) 4.  An about me link  Problems it's caused.  I now cannot scroll to the bottom of my page.  I'm sure I messed up some code when I added all that stuff.  I e-mailed blogger for help, but who knows how quickly they'll respond.  Their site did say that paying customers get first priority, and I'm all about free, so you my readers, if you know anything about html programming, please view my source code and see if you can figure out what I screwed up.  Thanks!  By the way, I love my hit counter.  I have it set to view unique visitors.  So, I'll probably have about 8 hits (the girls, myself, Mom, Jeremy, and Grandma), but maybe with my blogroll, I'll have more.  I can also check on the stats and find out where others navigated from and if they found my site by doing a search.  Very interesting.  Anyway, please e-mail or leave a comment if you know how to fix my scrolling problem.

       Eric just got up (yes it's 1:30 p.m.) and he came to ask me if I took a test.  I said yes, and then he showed me a "thumbs down" sign and I said yes.  Then he said, "Well your temperature is still up."  He looked at my chart!  Normally he seems a bit disinterested by the daily process (although I know he does want the same end result).  I think he does pay attention, but just doesn't want to show too much interest all the time, because he knows I'd never shut up.    I wish there was a different result.  I wish I was still convinced I was pregnant.  Maybe a little doubt is good.  I won't be so crushed if this isn't the month.  The good news is that we will know 100% for sure by Friday (18 DPO), probably sooner.

       Yesterday was fun.  We went to Will & Samara's for dinner.  It was so yummy!  Samara made Caribbean Jerk Chicken and we had Corn on the cob and Fetticini Alfredo.  Then we played Yahtzee.  Eric ended up winning, but I'm sure some time they'll be a rematch.  So this morning my temperature was only 98.0.  I wish it would have been 98.3, but I don't exactly consider that a "dip."  Also, being as obbsessive as I am, I took a pregnancy test.  It was negative.  I should have expected it, but it still brings me down a bit.  I know, I know, that's why all my friends said to wait as long as possible.  It's still early.  Here are some stats from Fertility Friend:  The average HPT positive is at 13.6 DPO. Percentage of pregnancy charts with a positive at 10 DPO = 10%. Percentage of preganncy charts with a positive at 12 DPO = 27% Percentage of pregnancy charts with a positive at 14 DPO = 60% Percentage of pregnancy charts with a positive at 16 DPO = 86% Percentage of pregnancy charts with a positive at 18 DPO = 100%  The meaning, waiting is better.  Now, originally, I wasn't going to test until 16 DPO.  I know I can't hold out that long.  With my usual lutal phase length, AF should be due tomorrow.  I'm going to make my next test day 14 DPO or Monday.  We'll see how that works.  An interesting comparison.  Today is CD 35.  Now, I don't actually know when I ovulated in my cycle the last time I was pregnant, but I did get a negative at CD 35 that time and didn't test again until CD42.  In this cycle, CD 42 would put me at 19 DPO.  No wonder it was so clearly positive.  I won't be waiting another week this time.  Ok, stuff to do.  We've got a hockey game to go to tonight and Jeremy's coming in.  I better clean the house and get some food.

       So my temp is still at 98.3.  That's good news right?  Plus I'm still feeling nauseous almost constantly.  I only ate about 3 bites of my Subway sandwich last night and then some crackers.  I may test tomorrow.  It's probably still early, but it's so hard to wait.  About the TV, there's really not much we can do apparently.  Image burn isn't covered under our service plan from Best Buy or under the Manufacturer's Warrenty, so no one wants to pay to get this fixed.  I guess all we can do is try to limit time on that channel and hope it doesn't get worse (or pay the $1000 ourselves when it does) or sue Fox for keeping their logo in one place on the screen the whole time.  Last night we were watching NBC, and there logo doesn't stay on the whole time, or it moves.  That would have helped.  Oh, Erica had good news yesterday.  No endometriosis re-growth and they'll let them start the preliminary fertility tests to reassure them nothings wrong.  They start trying again next week (how is it I'm still on this cycle?) and hopefully the doctor won't get a chance to do Erica's tests, because she'll be pregnant.  We're still waiting on news from our friends Will and Samara.  He had an interview this week and waiting for the result is torture (more for them than me I suppose).  We're going to thier place tonight for dinner and games.    Tomorrow we have tickets to go to a hockey game with our neighbors, so I'm looking forward to that.  Also, my brother, Jeremy will be coming into town to stay for a week while he's on Spring Break.  Hopefully, he won't think we're too boring.  Ok, I better leave for work.

       So, there's an issue with our TV.  Eric woke up this morning very angry.  I guess last night he was flipping through the channels and on a mostly blank screen noticed something in the corner.  "FOX 28" the station logo is being burned into our screen.  It isn't bad yet.  You can only notice it on a solid color screen and then you have to really look hard to make out what it says.  You can see something's there, but it doesn't just pop out on every channel.  Yet.  It will only get worse.  Now we knew the danger of having images burnt into our screen.  It is a projection TV, but we don't really feel that we "abuse" our TV watching privileges.  When we are home the TV is usually on, but we don't leave it on overnight or when we aren't home, etc.  We do watch a variety of channels and shows, so I'm a little amazed that this happens.  We watch Fox during the week for the 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. time block.  Then occasionally another program, like American Idol.  It isn't the only channel we watch and there are commercials, etc. so I'm really surprised that it's in there.  We figure that we have the TV on from about 6-11p.m. on weekdays maybe 5 or 6 hours on Saturday and from about 12p.m.-11 p.m. on Sundays.  That's a lot of time for the TV to be on for the 2 hours on weekdays to burn an image in the screen after 1 year.  We're heading to Best Buy tonight to see what we can do.  We do have the service plan, so they could replace the screen (costs about $1000), but I don't know that we'll want to do that every year.  The point of having a TV is to watch it, so we don't want to worry that by watching the TV we're screwing it up.  Or we may see if we can exchange our TV for a non-projection TV.  This option makes me a little sad as I love our 55" Widescreen HDTV and can't imagine what we would replace it with.  We would definitely have to get HD, but going smaller would be tough.  Or we may just ask for our money back.  How sad, I was going to send in the payoff this weekend.  We'll see what they say tonight.  On another note.  My temperature was 98.3 again today.

       Have I mentioned that I think I'm pregnant?  I've felt sick since about 3:00 p.m. (except for the 2 hours after I ate dinner).  I also was really lightheaded when I was leaving work (made me a little nervous to drive actually).  I just feel icky now so I'm going to head to bed and it's only 10:00 p.m.  I sure am going to feel silly next week if AF shows up.  If it's not pregnancy, I must be coming down with something.  At least my head doesn't hurt today.  Well, goodnight!

       I only have a minute, but I wanted to update.  My temp went back to 98.0 today.  It was a little disappointing, but it's still looking good, so I guess I'll just wait it out.  I will now wait until Wednesday to test.  I figure if I make it that far, there's a really good chance that it would be positive.  I really want it to be.  I wasn't able to pull off the "don't expect it to happen and it won't hurt as bad when it doesn't" thing this month.  I'll just wait and see.  Symptoms? I've had headaches the last 2 evenings which could be a hormonal surge or just me getting headaches.  I've also felt a little nauseous in the AM and the evening yesterday and the AM today.  Not bad enough to get sick, but I did decide against ice cream last night.  I also went to bed at 9:30 p.m. yesterday, which very rarely happens.  I've had breast tenderness, but it seems less pronounced today, so I'm not sure what that means.  It still hurts when I walk and they jiggle (sorry too much info), but not as much if I poke them.  On another subject.  I am planning a trip to see Mom & Dad in about 4 weeks.  I'll probably book the flight tonight.  I haven't been out there since Labor Day.  It'll be good to see the progress on the house.  Oh yeah, I took a picute of my birthday flowers yesterday, but didn't get around to downloading them.  I guess I'll do it when I get home tonight.  Not much else going on.  Well the pile of work on my desk is calling me.  I better get to it.

       98.3  Although I did temp about an hour later than normal....  "Don't get too excited.  Wait to see what it does tomorrow.  Don't get too excited.  Wait to see what it does tomorrow.  Don't get too excited.  Wait to see what it does tomorrow.  Don't get too excited.  Wait to see what it does tomorrow."  It's going to be a long 8 days.  Maybe I could test earlier than day 16 if my temps go triphasic?  Oh yeah, "Don't get too excited.  Wait to see what it does tomorrow."

       I don't think I mentioned it on my blog, but on Monday Eric sent me flowers to work.  It was really sweet.  He sent me Lilly's and Irises.  He picked Lilly's because he knew they were one of my favorite flowers and Irises because purple is my favorite color.  The card said, "I thank God every day for blessing me with your love. Love, Eric"  When I got the flowers none of the Lillys were open yet, so they've got a bit prettier every day.  This is a picture taken on Wednesday after some of my Lilly's opened.

        1.)Were you raised in a particular religious faith?  Yes, I grew in a Baptist church.    2.) Do you still practice that faith? Why or why not?  As of Sunday, I am joining a Methodist church, so I guess technically, no.  However, the core beliefs are very similar and it is still a “Christian” religion, so yes, I am still practicing my faith.   What do you think happens after death? It depends.  If you have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior (meaning that  1.  You believe that he gave his life to pay for your sins. 2. You believe that he rose from the dead three days later.  3.  You accept the gift of eternal life and promise to follow him, than you get to spend eternity in heaven with God.  If you have not done the above (and are mentally competent enough to understand what Jesus did for you, meaning doesn’t apply to babies or people with severe mental disorders) then you are forced to spend eternity in hell.   4.) What is your favorite religious ritual (participating in or just observing)?    I think weddings are beautiful.  On a more traditional “religious” ground, I think Communion is one of my favorites.  It seems like such a holy event, I even added it into my wedding.   5.) Do you believe people are basically good?  I think most people strive to be good and are more “good” than “evil.”  However, I believe that every person has a sinful nature and are not capable of living there lives without doing wrong.  That is why we can’t get into heaven without Jesus help.  No one but Him is perfect.

       I should be working, but Friday’s are so hard.  We just finished up Pete’s (my boss) baby shower here at the office.  I didn’t get the blanket I’ve been working on in time.  I got pretty close though.  They didn’t have tons of gifts, but we got them some big things from the office including a stroller and swing.  I’m starting to get really excited about my baby.  It still scares me a bit to go all out 100%, but I’ve been trying to focus on not worrying.  My appointment is in one week, so then I’ll really be able to breathe a sigh of relief and jump into the “I’m having a baby!” excitement.  I’m pretty sure things are progressing like they should.  The baby is making me sick and grumpy.  I’ve been nauseous for about a week now.  This morning was my worst morning at work.  I had to go and sit in the bathroom for a while because I was afraid to be at my desk and too far away for a graceful sprint to the restroom.  I ended up telling two more people that came in at different times and found me in the bathroom.  I just felt so sick and cried a little, but they were all happy for me even though, I was feeling miserable.  I had to take a walk outside too, to get some fresh air.  There are no windows (that open) in the office, and I had to breathe some fresh air.  It seems like I feel the worst between 8:30 and 9:30 a.m.  I try to eat some crackers in the morning while I’m getting ready and I eat an apple in the car on the way to work, but I still feel bad about the time I get here.  I hope I’m not complaining too much.  I have a hard time imagining feeling this bad or worse for the next 6 weeks, but the end product is worth it.  I bought some Sea Bands to see if they helped.  They didn’t.  I haven’t thrown up yet, but am still not counting on that to stay that way for 6 more weeks. I wish I had something more exciting to talk about, but until next week, my morning sickness is about it.

       I'm home sick today.  Yesterday afternoon I started to develop a headache.  I hate headaches.  I suffered through and went to the grocery store, but by 7:00 p.m. wanted nothing more than to lay on the couch.  Either the headache or morning sickness made food very undesirable, but as not eating just kept making me more nauseous, I made some chicken noodle soup.  I ate about a half a bowl.  Later I also had a couple of bites of ice cream.  Eric and were watching The Sixth Sense on ABC, but even with the only light in the room coming from TV hurting my eyes, I gave into my migraine and went to bed at about 9:30 p.m.  Yesterday, I also found out we don't have any Tylenol as Eric took our bottle to work and that's the only thing on my "approved medication" list from the doctor.  I didn't sleep well and remember waking up at about 4:30 a.m. thinking, why won't this headache go away?  When I got up at about 7, it had faded a bit, but was still lingering.  I decided to call in for the first half of the day and try to sleep a couple more hours.  I got up again at 10:00 a.m. and still felt bad.  Mostly morning sickness this time.  I decided to just make the whole day a sick day and stay home.  I think I could handle either the headache or morning sickness, but having both was just too much to deal with.  Well, I should feel better in another 6 to 7 weeks.  That seems like an incredibly long time to feel sick.  I'm not really complaining that much though.  This time I undeniably have pregnancy symptoms and that makes me less nervous about my appointment next week.  I've been praying and asking God to help me not to worry.  I didn't ask for Him to make me sick, but if being sick makes me worry less, than I'll take it.  I've also read that people with morning sickness are less likely to miscarry, although there are exceptions on both sides of that issue.  I told my boss I was pregnant yesterday.  For no real reason except that I felt sick and was tired and just felt like it, I cried twice at work yesterday morning.  I thought, maybe I should clue my boss in, so he doesn't think I'm having a mental breakdown.  He said congratulations.  I'm not really hiding it, but I'm still not announcing it to everyone yet, I think I want to wait until I have that ultrasound picture in my hand.    Ok, well, I'm getting queasy again, I think I'll go take a nap.  I just wish food sounded good.  On the bright side, I've lost a little weight.  I'm 2 1/2 pounds lighter than when I started BFL again on 3/22.  I'm sure that will change quickly in the next couple of months, but I don't really want to gain more than the recommended 3-4 pounds in the first trimester.  Looks like I'm going to be in good shape there.

       I figure while I'm online I'll do my developmental update.  Here's the update on me.  I think I have morning sickness.  Still no real urge to vomit, but I feel nauseous almost constantly, or at least as soon as my stomach starts to get empty.  It's a double edge sword.  When I start to get hungry (about every 2 hours) I also start to feel nauseous and then lose any desire for food.  The key is to eat as soon as I start to get hungry before I get nauseous.  Today is the worst I've felt.  I ate about a half a sleeve of crackers in the car on the way home.  Crackers help too.  It'll be interesting to see if this gets worse and how I'll feel when I have to go to work.  Ok, on to the physical development stuff.  Again from the three sources used last week plus  urlLink About.com    The Baby  Your baby has an incredible growth spurt this week!  At the beginning of the 7th week, the crown-to-rump length of your growing baby is 0.16 to 0.2 inch.  This is about the size of the BB pellet.  By the end of teh week, your baby has more than doubled in size, to 0.44 to .52 inch.  Leg buds are beginning to appear as short fins.  Arm buds have grown longer; they have divided into a hand segment and an arm-shoulder segment.  The hand and foot have a digital plate where the fingers and toes will develo/  The heart bulges from the body.  By this time, it has diveded into right and left heart chambers.  The primary bronchi are present.  The cerebral hemisphers, which make up the brain, are also growing.  Eyes and notstrils are developing.  Intestines are developing, an the appendix is present.  The pancreas, which produces teh hormone insulin, is also present. Part of the intestine bulges into the umbilical cord.  Later in your baby's development, it will return to the abdomen.  Technically your baby is still considered an embryo. That's because he has something of a small tail, which will disappear in the next few weeks. But that's the only thing getting smaller. The heart and brain are becoming more complicated, the eyelid folds are forming, and the tip of the nose is present.  Facial features are visible, including a mouth and tongue. The eyes have a retina and lens. The major muscle system is developed, and the unborn child practices moving. The child has its own blood type, distinct from the mother's. These blood cells are produced by the liver now instead of the yolk sac.   The hand plates become present this week, and the baby is about 7-9 mm CRL by the end of the week. The genital tubercle is present, but you can't distinguish girls from boys by sight at this point. Nasal pits are forming.  Your baby will actually go through 3 sets of kidneys, very rapidly as they develop during this period. This week the second of such sets will form.  With a transvaginal ultrasound, one study shows that 100% of the ultrasounds will be show a fetal pole with heart motion.   The Mom  Although you are probably quite anxious to show the world you're pregnant, there still may be little change.  Changes will come soon, though.  Changes are occurring gradually.  You still probably wont' "show," and people won't be able to tell you're pregnant unless you tell them.  You may be gaining weight throughout your body, but you should have gained only a couple of pounds this early in your pregnancy.  If you haven't gained weight or if you have lost a couple of pounds, it isn't unusual.  It will go the other direction in the weeks to come.  You may still experience morning sickness and other symptoms of early pregnancy.  You're in the throes of the first trimester, when many women complain of common pregnancy aches and pains. Keeping food down may be next to impossible, thanks to morning sickness, caused in part by the pregnancy hormones in your body. You may also need to use the bathroom a lot more often than usual — your growing uterus is pressing on your bladder, and hormones are affecting the balance of fluid in your body. These symptoms should diminish as your pregnancy continues.  You may have symptoms ... nausea or queasiness, odd tastes in your mouth, bigger, more sensitive breasts, moodiness... or you may not. Some women have already gained weight, though others, due to morning sickness , may have actually lost weight. Both are common and normal.  Your face may break out due to the changes in hormones. So even though you may feel like a teenager again, you are not alone.

       Well, the lastest GWO has come to a close and plans have been laid for the next visit in July.  Here's a recap of the weekend.   Thursday  I headed out of work at 1:30 p.m for a 2:15 p.m. client meeting.  One of the other two people involved in the meeting got tied up and wasn't able to get together, so at 3:00 p.m. we decided to postpone the meeting and I got to head out.  By 3:30 I was fueled up and on the road.  I was the first to arrive at Erica's at about 6:30 p.m. Indiana time.  My pregnancy bladder kicked in though, and I had to make three bathroom stops on the way plus one stop for food.  Danialle made it in just before 8:00 p.m.  We watched Survivor and started gabbing away.  Heather joined us around 9:00 p.m.  Oh, there was much to discuss.  I of couse had all my baby news and there were other stories shared, that should probably be kept off the public internet domain.     Friday  We got up at a reasonable time, ate some breakfast and headed to Christina's for our facial appointments.  Erica and Danialle were at 10:00 a.m. and Heather and I were at 11:00 a.m.  It was Hawaiian day and they had special prizes and a whole Hawaiian decorative theme.  We were treated to a free parafin hand dip (it was ok, but I don't know that I would have paid for it) and I won 20% off of any products I bought.  The facial was heaven again, like I remembered, but it seems like Heather and Danialle's facialist was not as good.  They didn't get the neck and shoulder massage part of it.  After facials, we grabbed lunch at Applebee's and headed to All Fired Up to paint pottery.  We, somewhat naively, each chose two pieces to paint and spent the next four hours there.  It was definately a good time though.  After pottery, we went home, showered & changed and left for dinner at Mt. Fugi Japanese steakhouse.  It was fun and good food.  After dinner we stopped for ice cream and then by Pricilla's to peruse the lingerie.  Then we headed home threw on the PJs and relaxed.   Saturday  We had breakfast at Nirvana's and then headed out for a day of shopping in Indianapolis.  Our first stop was Half Price Books where I think we all walked away with a good sackful.  Then we hit the mall in Castleton.  Boy we can shop.  I think we all made some great purchases.  I bought a black pair of dress pants from The Limited that I've wanted since I bought my white one's in February.  They fit so nicely, but should still give me a little room to grow before I have to switch to maternity pants.  I also bought a very cute jean skirt at Motherhood Maternity.  I love trying on clothes with the little belly pillow.  Hopefully, there will be much more maternity shopping in July with Erica needed some too.  After the mall we had dinner at Hooters.  Then we headed back to Erica's.  Heather ended up leaving to head home for a date with a new special someone and the rest of us went to the grocery store for some snacks we didn't end up eating.  We played three games of Euchre with Danialle and I partnering against Erica and Eric.  Erica and Eric won 2 of the 3 games.  Maybe that's why boys shouldn't be allowed?  Then we headed for bed.  As always happens on the last night, Danialle and I didn't go right to sleep and stayed up for who knows how long talking.  All I know is I had to pee twice during the conversation.   Sunday  Danialle left at about 8:00 a.m. in order to get her rental car back before noon.  I slept another hour and left at 9:00 Indiana time.  I got home just before 2:00 p.m. my time.  Our next visit is the weekend of July 23rd.  I'm ready to start counting down the days.

       Only about 5 hours until I’m on the road for GWO.  I actually get to leave the office in 1 ½, so that’s cool.  I am so excited to catch up with my girls and just hang out.  I’m a bit disappointed this morning, because I was so sure that this was it for Erica.  What do I expect, I’m always wrong.  I’m not giving up hope though.  Except for her negative test, there’s no real reason to believe it’s over yet.  I just talked to my Dad.  Today’s his birthday.  Last year I forgot to send him a card or even call.  This year I got his card in the mail early (although he said he hasn’t got it yet) and I made sure to call him at work.  My Dad is the best and deserves to know I’m thinking of him.  A couple more people at work now know my news.  Tammy accidentally spilled the beans to a couple people in the lunch room yesterday.  I wasn’t even there.  We’ll see how long it stays quiet.  I haven’t even told my boss yet.  Maybe I should say something, but I want to wait until my doctor’s appointment.    Ok, well that’s probably the last update until Sunday when I’ll give a full recap of my weekend with the girls.  Also, stay tuned Monday for what is happening during week 7 of fetal development.  Tomorrow is officially 6 weeks.

       Maybe it's just me, but don't some things seem like they should be pretty simple?     The white thing is the laundry hamper.  We used to keep it in the bathroom, but I thought maybe it would help if I put it closer to the pile of clothes on the floor.  Nope.  Just wait until I start laundering only clothes that are "in" the hamper.

       You remember the other day when I said I felt nauseous?  I was wrong.  Yesterday I felt nauseous.  It hit me right about 9:00 a.m. for maybe a half hour.  I actually went into the restroom a couple of times, just in case.  I never actually got sick, but I was not especially happy, when people in the office wanted to talk to me.  You know when you don’t feel good and feel like carrying on a conversation is too much effort?  I seriously considered going home and facing my first day of morning sickness from the comfort of my own bedroom, but by the time I figured out what work I was going to take home, I felt better.  I also took a trip down to the convenience store in the lobby of the building to buy some saltines.  They were out!  Last night, I bought a box at the grocery store, that is now safely in my desk drawer.  I haven’t felt sick since then, but can conceive that I may again sometime in the next 6 to 8 weeks.    I'm also doing some growing up top.  I think tonight I may have Eric take pictures in my bikini top.  I wonder if my “growth” is noticeable in pictures.  I have my BFL before pictures from 5 weeks ago and would be interested to see the difference.  Maybe it's all in my head.  I’m ready (mentally) for GWO this weekend.  Only 2 more days of work.  Also, by then we should know if Erica and Eric were successful this month.  I’ve been saying a prayer for them.  So far things look promising.

       Ok, I lied.  We're doing the developmental update tonight.  Sources of information are "Your Pregnancy Week by Week", babycenter.com, and babyzone.com.  All information is for Week 6.   The Baby  The crown-to-rump length of your growing baby is 0.08 to 0.16 inch (2 to 4 mm).  Occasionally, with the proper equipment, a heartbeat can be seen on ultrasound by the 6th week.  This is the beginning of the embryonic period (from week 6 to week 10 of pregnancy.  It is a period of extremely important development in your baby!  Around this time the neural groove closes and early brain chambers form.  The eyes are also forming.  Limb buds appear.  The heart tubes fuse and heart contractions begin.  Cells are dividing furiously as your embryo takes shape. By week's end, it's about the size of a small lentil bean (4 to 5 millimeters across). If you could see through your uterine walls, you'd find an overlarge head and dark spots where the eyes and nostrils are beginning to form. The emerging ears are marked by pits and the arms and legs by protruding buds. The embryo's hands and feet are shaped like paddles, and fingers are beginning to form even now. The heart has divided into the right and left chambers and is beating between 100 and 130 times a minute. The pituitary gland is also forming.  This week your embryo is working very hard to begin growing its nervous system. There's a primitive heart now, and just wait until it can show you its love!  Tiny buds have appeared -- if all goes well, these will someday be arms to hug you and legs to kick at you during temper tantrums.  By now, your baby displays reflexes in response to a touch!   This means his nervous system is communicating with his primitive muscle cells.  This communication forms the foundation of all your baby's behavior even after birth.    The Mom  You may have gained a few pounds by now.  If you have been nauseated and not eating well, you may have lost weight.  You have been pregnant for 1 month, which is enough time to notice some changes in your body.  If this is your first pregnancy, your abdomen may not have changed much.  Or you may notice your clothes are getting a little tighter around the waist.  You may be gaining weight in your legs or other places, such as your breasts.  If you have a pelvic exam, your healthcare provider can usually feel your uterus and note some change in its size.  If you haven't already, you may soon find yourself riding pregnancy's emotional roller coaster, feeling moody one day and joyful the next. Disturbing as this is to some women who pride themselves on being in control, what you're going through is normal and will probably continue throughout your pregnancy. Up-and-down emotions are partly caused by fluctuating and (in many cases) very high levels of hormones.  Your uterus is the size of a plum, your breasts may be incredibly tender, and, ugh, you may start feeling some odd symptoms , though for some women the morning sickness doesn't kick in until later (if at all). Because this is a critical time in your baby's organ development, avoid alcohol, substances, drugs, and treatments that you don't really need. If you haven't done so already, find a doctor, and make that appointment.

       I'm so sad this weekend is coming to an end.  Here's my recap.   Friday  We went to dinner at Champps with Will and Samara.  It was really nice because we haven't seen them in person in almost two months.  We got to catch up a bit and just hang out.     Saturday  I spent the morning and afternoon cleaning the house.  It was a beautiful day so Eric did yardwork and I had the windows open.  It feels so good to know everything is clean and not be cooped up in a dirty house.  In the early evening Will and Samara came over (with Chance) and we grilled some hamburgers, hot dogs and brats.  April and Martin came over too and I think everybody had a good time.  Zeus had so much fun playing with his doggy friends.  (Jax and Peaches came over too).  Samara also showed me a scrapbook page she made on the computer, which seems like a good way to go.  It's the kind of thing you could use, if you like the idea of scrapbooking, but the actual work of cutting out paper and pictures and gluing isn't that exciting.  Anyway, after dinner we took all the dogs to Brusters for some ice cream.  Then Will and Samara took off (they are both taking classes and have homework to do).  Then April and Martin came back to our house and we played Phase 10.  I won.    Sunday  We went to church.  It was a little weird.  At the end of every service they read prayer requests that people write on these cards.  Well, this morning.  One of the requests was for "Megan and Chad who lost a baby this week."  That was really hard for me to hear and I started to get a bit teary.  (I don't know who Megan and Chad are, but my heart breaks for them).  Then the next request was for "Jennifer Cruz who lost her fourth baby in a miscarriage."  I just couldn't take it.  I just cried.  I wasn't loud or obnoxious, but I did need to dig the Kleenex out of my purse.  By the time the service was over, I was under control and we had Sunday School.  Lew, our teacher, saw me before class and asked how I was feeling (I told the class last week about our answer to prayer).  I told him, "fine."  Then he asked me how Eric was doing.  I said he was doing good.  Then we went up to class.  At the end of Sunday School, we also do prayer requests before we pray and leave.  A couple people had requests, and then Lew looked and me and said, "What about you guys?"  I said, "Yes, the same as last week.  We're a little nervous, but doing good."  He then said he thought I lost the baby.  When he heard the prayer request during church, he thought it was me.  It wasn't.  It was such a bizarre mix up though.  I guess he even told the people in the class before we went up there.  Everyone was all confused.  We straightened it out though.  This afternoon we went to a Membership Class at the church.  I think we are going to join.  It's a little weird for me since it's a Methodist Church and I've always been in Baptist churches, but this is the first place that's really felt like home in 3 years.  I love the paster and think he's really easy to understand and listen too.  I love their "new" contemporary service with praise and worship.  I love our Sunday school class.  I'm excited about meeting more people and getting involved in service.  This church really seems to be in the right direction about focus.  The only thing I see different in the demoninations is some of the structure and organization of the administration.  The core beliefs seem to be the same.  I asked about baptism and while they do "baptize" babies.  You don't have too.  They leave that up to the parents and if we want to wait until our child has the chance to make the decision on his/her own, that's ok too.  He will also do the person's choice of sprinkling, pouring, or dunking.  I think I can live with that.  We are planning on joining in two weeks.  April will be our sponser.  Well, that's about it for now.  Be sure to tune in tomorrow for the baby development info for what happens in during week 6.  It's sure to be exciting.

       Today is the due date from my first pregnancy.    I wasn't really sure how I would feel today.  How do I feel?  Pretty good actually.  It's a beautiful day, the sun is shining, I've got the windows open.  I've been cleaning the house while Eric does yard work.  It's spring.  But I don't have a baby. I think I'm ok with that for now.  It really does help that I know I have one on the way that should be here in 8 months.  I almost feel bad that I'm not more emotional today.  I suppose it's ok.  I've certainly been emotional about it enough over the last 6 months.  Right now I just want to focus on my new baby and my new due date.  I'm so thankful that I have that to look forward to today.  So, Baby I never knew, I miss you today, but know that soon enough I'll have a baby to keep here with me forever.

       Well, we are officially five weeks today.  It's still hard to comprehend.  I think I'll update with the next week of development info on Monday.  I have two new symptoms this week. 1. Yesterday I had my first wave of "official" nausea.  It didn't send me to the restroom, but it was a definate feeling.  We'll see what happens in the next couple of weeks. 2. My breast tenderness isn't as noticable as I remember it being last time I was pregnant (so of course, I am slightly concerned).  However, last night I noticed that now my nipples have become sore and super sensitive.  It's a change, so I'm taking that as a good sign.  Overall, I feel pretty good.  I'm either starving or have no desire to eat.  I've been super tired and irritable.  Sounds like fun, right?  It'll be worth it.  Only 6 more days until I find out if Erica's doing this with me and 6 more days until GWO.  I'm very excited.

       A visible heartbeat could be seen and detectable by pulsed doppler ultrasound by about 6 weeks and is usually clearly depictable by 7 weeks. If this is observed, the probability of a continued pregnancy is greater than 83 percent.  I should be in good shape to see the heartbeat at my 8 week appointment and if we do, the chance of loss is dramatically reduced.

       I am so tired.  I forgot how utterly exhausted this could make me.  I still wonder with it being so early what symptoms are in my head and what's real, but I think this one is for real. It seems to really kick in after I eat, which I've been doing every 2 to 3 hours. Yesterday, I took a 45 minute nap when I got home from work.  I'm a little concerned about next weekend when I have to drive to Indiana after work for GWO.  Four hours in the car by myself after working all day.  I better have some good tunes.  I've only been slightly nauseous, but for some reason feel like I'll be getting worse in the next couple of weeks.  I can't explain why, I just feel like it.  I'm cranky.  It's kind of like PMS in overdrive.  I actually had a co-worker comment on it today.  Then I apologized and about broke into tears.  Yep, this could be a roller coaster ride.  Yesterday I was ready to go off on a particular telemarketer that calls the house several times a day.  We screen our calls, but if they would have called after 6 yesterday, I was going to answer.  I told Eric I was angry when he got home and he was able to bring me out of my funk.  Today, another co-worker made a negative comment about what I was wearing (this is the same co-worker that made the inappropriate comment after my miscarriage).  Personally I liked what I was wearing.  He tried to back peddle and later that afternoon as I walked by said, "You look nice today."  I told the person in his doorway that he didn't like my shirt.  Then the coworker held his tie above his head like he was hanging himself.  The person in the doorway said, "He's hanging himself."  I said, "He should."  Ok, Jennifer, calm the hormones down.  Now I'm the inappropriate one.  I need to start thinking before I speak before I say something I can't take back.  There may be other symptoms, but I'm too tired to think about them right now.  I'm deleriously happy, regardless.  Today we visited Kim to see the baby at home.  He's two weeks old and still weighs less than 5 pounds.  I wanted to take him home.  This time it didn't ache so bad.  I know soon enough, I will have one to take home.

       On Saturday, Eric received a summons for jury duty.  It starts May 10 at 8:00 a.m. and he has to be available for 2 weeks.  My doctor's appointment was scheduled for May 13th.  So, since it is unlikely that he would be able to get out of jury duty, I called the doctor to see if they could move my appointment up.  The appointment desk had me leave a message on the nurse line, since any earlier would be out of their recommended 9-11 week time frame.  In my voicemail I told her why I wanted to change it and why I preferred to make it earlier rather than move it back two weeks.  When the nurse called back she was very nice and had no problem moving my appointment.  My appointment is now Friday, May 7th at 1:40 p.m.  I'll be 8 weeks pregnant.  I'm so happy they made it earlier.  That's just over 3 weeks away now.  That doesn't sound like that long to wait.

       Here is some info on development taken form BabyCenter and BabyZone.com.   Your Body  Your breasts may hurt, you may feel tired, queasy and hungry along with the dreaded morning sickness , perhaps you have an odd, metallic taste in your mouth, or you just may be running to the bathroom to pee all the time as your growing uterus presses your bladder. Or maybe it's just a feeling you have -- an intuition. Whatever your clues, you may not want to wait for your doctor's appointment and instead will decide to take a Home Pregnancy Test. Be careful! If you take it too soon you may get a false negative.   How your life is changing:  The outside world won't see any sign of the dramatic developments taking place inside you — except maybe that you're suddenly eating better. Good nutrition is particularly important during these first critical weeks when your baby's vital organs are developing.  Pregnancy symptoms continue or start up this week. If you're like most women, you'll notice nausea (and not just in the morning), sore breasts, fatigue, and frequent urination. All are normal, all are annoying, but the upside is that they're all a part of being pregnant and won't last forever.   Your Baby  Your embryo is the size of a raisin (only 1/10 of an inch or 1.5-3 mm). By day twenty-one, the embryo's tiny heart has begun beating. The neural tube enlarges into three parts, soon to become a very complex brain. The placenta begins functioning. The spine and spinal cord grows faster than the rest of the body at this stage and give the appearance of a tail-- Don't worry Mom, This will disappear as the child continues to grow.    How your baby's growing:  You may not look pregnant yet (you may not even have any symptoms), but your embryo is busy growing. At this point he looks more like a tiny tadpole than a human. But this week, the heart begins to beat, the cells for the major organs, including the kidneys and heart, begin to develop, and the neural tube, which connects the brain and spinal cord, closes.  This is an important week.  I can't believe we may be growing a heart right now.  Just a couple more weeks until I can see it.  I'm thinking I may not escape pregnancy symptoms this time.  I've lost my appetite (I even turned down ice cream yesterday).  My sense of smell is especially keen.  The only time I've felt nauseous is when I've smelled something strong.  Like when I had to clean up Zeus' mess from eating too much people food out of the trash way too fast.  Gross.  I've also had "other" stomach issues.  It's ok.  I love every moment if it means I get to be a Mom soon.

       Friday night, just for fun, I decided to use the other pregnancy test I had in the house.  This may not have been a well thought out plan.  After all, it was still the same day as my first positive, but later at night (10:30 p.m.) and I'd probably not had as concentrated hormone as I'd like to see.  Regardless, I decided to take another test.  It's more fun when you know the answer.  It was the second of the cheap Target one's I bought. It was #2 in a pack I bought for $7.  I got a second line on this one too and it was even darker and easier to read.  I thought I'd post it here for all to see too.     I really am pregnant!

       Last night we went to the Good Friday service at the church we've been attending and then went to dinner with our neighbors.  April and I were talking about my news and I brought up what a miracle this has been.  About three weeks ago, I shared my story of the miscarriage and trying again with the Sunday School class and asked for prayers this month to "let it go."  I was serious when I said that I thought God wanted me to learn that He is in control.  April made a comment that it was like God was saying, "I have this wonderful gift for you, but I just need you to learn one thing first."  I hope I've learned.    I know alot of people pray for things they need or want.  They turn to God in hard times, but I think the tendency is that when you get what you want, you say, "Well, thanks God.  Good job.  Now I think I can handle it from here."  My prayer now is to realize that I'm  still  not in control. It's not time for me to take it back over.  One thing I learned from my miscarriage was that it wasn't my "fault."  I couldn't have done anything differently to get a different outcome.  I think I need God even more right now.  I want to say, "Thanks God.  Good job.  Now we've still got a lot of work to do.  You can protect this baby more than I can.  Keep it safe for me."  Letting God stay in control should be a real source of comfort for me.  If He's in control, then I shouldn't even waste my time worrying.  There's nothing I can do and by worrying, it's a sign that I can't complete trust that He's doing it right.  Now I'm human, so I'm sure I'll worry, but I'll try not to take my burden back away from Him too often.  I think this is something He can handle more than I can.

        1. What do you do for a living?  I work for a global insurance brokerage.  I work on Casualty Placements (Auto Liability, General Liability, Workers Comp, Umbrella Liability) for Fortune 500 companies.  My job consists of negotiations with insurance underwriters and day-to-day service for my clients.   2. What do you like most about your job?  It's challenging.  I get to learn a lot about my clients operations and the insurance industry.  It requires creativity and problem solving skills and I feel like I make a difference.   3. What do you like least about your job?  There are alot of professional standards to follow and it's a world of deadlines.  It seems like there isn't enough time to do everything and have it done right.   4. When you have a bad day at work it's usually because _____...  Mostly internal conflicts.  I work on a team and sometimes people delegate too much and I get the feeling they aren't pulling their weight.  Or, I'm coming up on a deadline and the deal doesn't fall into place until the last possible moment.   5. What other career(s) are you interested in?  Right now nothing.  I love my job.  I would possibly consider switching to the client side in the future.  Maybe work as a company's Risk Manager.  That's still be in the same industry.

       I called the doctor's office this morning.  I told them that I had an appointment scheduled for April 29th, and then they cancelled it.  She also told me that the doctor won't do my PAP at that visit, but will do it later in pregnancy.  She told me that they normally like to see patients when they are between 9 and 11 weeks (I remember from last time).  I told her if possible, I'd like to be on the shorter end of that scale since I had a miscarriage in September that was discovered at that appointment.  The less time I have to wait, the less stress.  So, she made my new appointment for May 13th.  I'll be 9 weeks.  She also told me she's going to call in a prescription for a pre-natal vitamin.  I went and picked them up this afternoon.  I told Tammy at work this morning.  Her husbands office is right next to mine, so when I saw he came in, I headed over to her cube.  I took my purse with me and told her I had something to show her.  She looked at me and I know she knew what it was, but I pulled out the test (pee stick, as she likes to call it).  She screamed.  I mean loud.  She was then crying and hugging me, and Heidi, who sits on the back side of her cube, said, "Oh, my gosh," and came to investigate.  Luckily, it was only about 8:15 a.m.  and there were only two other people on that side of the office.  (They are both men that I don't really work with or speak to, so I think my secret is still safe).  I told them the story and we were all shaking and crying.  It was very good.  Besides Tammy and Heidi, I also e-mailed Kim K. (mostly because she was around for a discussion I had with Tammy yesterday and knew AF was late and I was testing today).  Tammy also told Chris (with permission, but they're married, so what do you expect).  I also probably shouldn't have, but told the intern.  It was just too perfect of a set up.  Yesterday, she was making all these jokes saying she was pregnant, and how she wasn't married, etc. but happened to be doing it right in front of the new girl (who I discovered yesterday is also pregnant).  Today, I gave her a heads up that the new girl was pregnant and she was a bit embarrased for going on like that.  Then she started saying how it was crazy that all these people in the office were pregnant.  She said Tammy just had a baby, and Laurie is pregnant, and Pete's wife, and the new girl.  Then she said, "Who else is pregnant?"  I just kept my mouth shut, sort of shrugged with a smile on my face.  Her eyes got really big and she said, "You!"  I said yes, and she about ratted me out to the other side of the office.  Her reaction wasn't quite as loud as Tammy's though.  So 4 people.  That's not so bad for me.  I'll see if I can make it to my doctor's appointment without telling the rest of the office.  Ok enough for now, I'll have to save something to discuss later.  I'm going to update my info now, I may also remove the Fertility Friend ticker, as I think you have to log into Fertility Friend for it to be updated.

       Well, today was my test day.  It was good.     Maybe it's hard to see on the picture, but in the bathroom, the line was definately there. Edited to add:   Grrrr.  My online picture account is locked!  E-mail me at work if you want to see the picture.  I don't know how long the pictures will be locked.   I woke up this morning just before 6:00 a.m.  I'd been having restless dreams about getting the thermometer in my mouth to take my temperature.  When I woke up I decided to go ahead and temp.  While I was waiting, I said a little prayer.  It was still 98.3.  I was so happy.  I wanted to try to lay there until closer to time to get up, but decided I probably wasn't going back to sleep, so I might as well go start the test.  I went the bathroom, did the deed and went back to the bed to wait.  I started thinking that even if I ovulated last Saturday, which was the latest I think it could have happened, then I'd still be 13 DPO and that was a mighty fine high temp.  After about 2 minutes I went to check.  I still couldn't really see either line, so I decided to go let the dog out.  After I came back, I went in took a deep breath, and...2 lines.  I immediately started sobbing.  I can hardly believe it's finally happened again.  I was still crying and went out to the bedroom, sat on the edge of the bed and hugged Eric.  He woke up and asked me what was wrong, and I told him, "I'm pregnant."  He hugged me and then asked if they were tears of joy.  Of course they are.  He did get up and peek at the test, but nows he's back in bed.  It was only 6:00, so I'll let him sleep a little.  He tried to figure out a due date and came up with January.  My calculations put it at December 17th.    I'm sure there's much more to write about, but I want to make sure I put in here how much I believe God had to do with this.  I know he doesn't cause bad things to happen, but I think he can help you learn a lesson from all events.  I've always been a bit of a control freak and tried to do the same thing with my reproductive life.  After I lost the baby, I immediately assumed I could get pregnant again immediately and set about to planning it.  Some things you can't plan.  I did everything "right" and it didn't work.  But this month, I felt "led", if you will, to let go of all of it.  I put away the thermometer (until this week) and didn't focus so much on doing it at the "right" time, and tried to focus on other areas of my life and just have faith that God would let me get pregnant again in his own time.  Maybe just realizing I wasn't in control was enough of a lesson for me, that he didn't make me wait too long.  Of course, I'm not saying this was miraculous conception, we still did our part, but I just realized that I wasn't in control.  Now I just pray, that this baby will stay safe and inside me for the next 9 months.    I'm not sure who I'm telling yet.  Of course you all know, so family and outside friends will know.  I think I'm just telling Tammy at work though.  I'll wait on the whole office thing.  Now, to see what the doctor wants to do about my appointment for my annual in 3 weeks...

       I am so furious right now.  This morning when I went out to my car, my gym bag was dumped out on my front seat and my Mini-disk player was gone.  I immediately called Eric at work because I wondered if he had taken it to the office for some reason since his was inside and upstairs.  No such luck.  Someone stole things out of my car!  It was kind of crazy because they took the time to dump my bag and decide what they wanted.  They didn't steal my tennis shoes (which were probably worth more than the mini-disk player) and all my other stuff was there.  Just the player, arm band, and my awesome headphones  (I had the kind that just attached to your ear, but still had the padded earpiece).  They didn't find the compartment that had all the other disks I had made in it (they just got the one in the player) and they didn't take my extra batteries.  It looked like they looked for stuff in the main console where my CD's are, but only figured out how to open the top part, so didn't find my CD's.  They also thankfully left my sunglasses and pass for the parking garage.  Eric went out to check his car after my call, and found that they took his briefcase, which had his palm pilot and day planner inside.  That sucks.  Luckily, all of his CD's are currently in the house, as we are working on sorting them out right now.  The bad thing is I can think of three ways this could have been prevented.  1.  Eric could have shut the garage door when he came home from work.  It was open last night from about 6:00 p.m until 9:00 p.m.  2.  I could have locked my car.  Eric usually locks his, but I leave mine unlocked so I don't have to mess with unlocking it in the morning when my hand's are full. Of course that wouldn't have been an issue if the garage door was closed.  3.  If I would have went to the gym last night, my clothes in the gym bag would have been dirty and I would have taken my bag in the house.  I usually don't leave stuff in my car, but I figured I'd leave my bag out there so I wouldn't have to bring it the next day if I wanted to work out.  It's just stuff, but it makes me angry that people have the guts to walk right up into your home and take things.  It's a little scary because I must have been home and the door to the house from the garage was unlocked too.  Ok enough, I need to focus on more positive things now.

       Ok, so now this is getting harder.  Thanks to my discussion with Erica this morning via e-mail, I've decided to temp Thursday and Friday.  Mostly, so I'll know if AF is coming and not be surprised unexpectedly.  Also, I only have 1 test left and if my temp is down Friday, I will wait to take it.  So now just 2 more days.  I hope Erica's good feelings translate into good results.  I don't know how I feel.  Just ready to know about this one.  I've been neglecting my diet this week, and am ready to know if Monday I should be starting back full force.  I probably should regardless, but it'd be easier if I knew I wasn't pregnant.

       I tried to post this earlier, but my computer shut down.  I'll try to hit the highlights again.  Up until now I had been pretty sure that this wasn't going to be the month.  I was of course hoping to be pleasantly surprised, but wasn't holding out much hope.  It's been a pretty good month overall, not a lot time spent worry about my temps or hitting the window, etc.  I also haven't had any of the crazy symptoms I had last month, so it's pretty easy to not obsess.  To give you a clue as to how much I really believe I'm probably not pregnant...Last night around 6:00 p.m. I took Imitrex for a headache I had developed.  I figure it was probably related to stress as I spent most of the afternoon dreading a meeting that I had first thing this morning.  Now I know taking my meds probably wasn't the smartest thing to do, but it was too much of a temptation considering my options.  A.  Suffer the entire evening, unable to eat, watch TV, read, play on the computer, etc.  B.  Go immediately to bed and hope the headache was gone by morning or C.  Take one little pill, have the pain gone within an hour with the downside being that Imitrex is in the "unknown effects" category for pregnancy and I have no "real" reason to believe I'm pregnant.  This time the headache won.  However, also since yesterday, I have a new reason to start obsessing.  Yesterday evening post-headache, I suddenly noticed that my breast tenderness seemed to increase in severity.  As you probably know, breast tenderness is one of my common symptoms during my lutal phase, and doesn't make me think I'm pregnant.  I've had it as long as I can remember before my period.  However, since I've been charting I've noticed that it tends to get better as I get closer to my period (presumably as my body slows down the progesterone production) and they are completely back to normal with a day or two after AF arrives.  So this  increase  in tenderness has started me thinking.  Also, I took my temperature this morning.  I wanted to wear my white pants to the meeting I had this morning and it seemed like an awfully big risk to where white so close to the expected arrival of AF.  So, I decided to temp to be sure that she probably wouldn't be arriving a couple of days early.  This morning my temp was 98.2.  That seems pretty high to me.  Again, I'm glad I haven't been temping because even that one temperature has me trying to start analyzing.  So now I have a couple of reasons to think it could be a possibiltiy (oh yeah, Erica says she has a good feeling too), however, I still have the reasons to believe AF could be here too.  Some moodiness, the acne outbreak a couple of days ago (although that still may have been related to the facial, because it's cleared up), the desire for salt and sugar rather than chicken and veggies (who am I kidding, when have I ever desired chicken and veggies over a pint of Ben & Jerry's?).  I guess only time will tell.    If I'm not pregnant, AF should arrive by the end of the week, possibly over the weekend if my lutal phase is on the long side and I'm off on my ovulation date.  I'm testing Friday regardless.  I hope I get 2 lines instead of one.  If I'm not pregnant, I'd rather not make it to Friday to take the test.  Negatives are so disappointing.  3 more days to wait.

       I've been in Iowa since Thursday, below is the play-by-play.  It was so good to spend time with family just because without the stress of holidays, etc.  I hadn't seen Mom and Dad since Christmas, so it was about time for a visit.  I think it was a really good visit and had a really nice time.   Thursday  I worked until noon and then came home, went to the gym for my cardio, came home and finished packing.  Eric picked me up to go to the airport around 3:15 p.m.  My flight left at 5:05 p.m.  I got into DesMoines around 8:00 p.m. (Central) and Mom picked me up.  We went back to the house and just hung out and caught up a little.   Friday  We got up bright and early to head for our day at the spa.  It was good, but we were a  little disappointed because they kept us separate all day.  We kind of wanted to do our spa day "together", but hey, it was still a day at the spa.  I started with an hour long facial which was so great (I'm leaning towards a facial at the girl's weekend).  After my facial I had a pedicure and manicure and really had a great chat with the pedicure/manicurist.  My feet felt so soft afterwards and my nails had really grown alot lately so now they look good.  After my manicure they took me into a room with a recliner and TV to hang out until my next appointment.  I was probably in there for about an hour, but they brought me lunch (had to even eat lunch without Mom).  While I was waiting, Mom came in and had finished her body wrap and massage and it was time for her to eat lunch.  They came and got me for my body wrap and massage.  The body wrap was bizarre.  I got to wear a "spa thong" and they took rubber ACE bandages (soaked in some kind of hot herbal blend) and wrap you from ankle to wrist to neck.  They take measurements before and after and I lost about 5 inches (I'm sure it was just temporary).  After being wrapped, they put you in a rubber suit and took me back to the recliner room to soak.  I waited about an hour and then they took me back and unwrapped me.  Then I had my massage.  It wasn't as great as my previous massage, but getting rubbed for an hour, I'm not complaining.  After my massage, I went out and my manicurist, washed and styled my hair.  We were there until about 4:00 p.m.  After the spa we drove back to the house and picked up Dad to go to dinner.  We ate at the Peppertree?  It was yummy.  Then we went back to the house and Mom and I watched Pirates of the Caribbean (well I watched and Mom dozed).   Saturday  Mom made Waffles, Bacon and eggs for breakfast and then we went to DesMoines to go shopping.  We went to Bed, Bath, and Beyond and I got a few things.  Then to the mall and I got a new pair of jeans from New York and Company and three tops from Sears.  The jeans were only $20 and the tops were on clearance for $3.97 each.  That's quite a bargin.  After shopping we headed home and took a nap.  Saturday evening, I set my Mom up with her very own blog and did a basic html programming lesson.  She caught on pretty quick and it was fun.   Sunday  We got up (seemed early with the time change) and went to their church.  Then straight from church to the airport.  I got home around 6:30 p.m. and Eric and I went for BW3's.  So that was my weekend.  Now on to the TTC news...   TTC News  I've got mixed feelings.  I am trying not to rule out the possibility that this month could have worked, but if I had to take bets, I'm probably about 85% convinced that this isn't the month.  Based on when I think I ovulated, I'm about 9 days post ovulation and am planning on testing on Friday if no AF.  If negative, I'll wait until Monday to test again.  If I'm right about when I ovulated, AF should be here on Thursday.  Here's why I think she may be right on time: 1.  Friday evening, I developed some new blemishes.  I've never had a facial before, so don't know if the fact that they cleaned everything out would make me more likely to have some new blemishes spring up, but by the time I got home, I developed three small ones above my left eyebrow and one on my chin.  It seems more likely to me that I'm breaking out because my period is due next week. 2.  I didn't stick to my diet as planned.  It's tough while traveling anyway, but maybe I should have had some more willpower. 3.  I've been kind of mean to Eric since I got home.  Not really emotionally unstable mean, but just picking on him.  Like I'll go to give him a kiss and then just feel like pinching him.  It's weird really.  Makes me think the irritability is just days away.  Last month I had so many "symptoms" I was convinced.  I don't really have any this time.  I don't have any reason to believe that this month could be it.  I'm not really that concerned though.  I still haven't decided on charting next month.  I'm leaning more towards not charting.  I can show the doctor my previous charts and tell her where I think I am in my cycle.  I have a feeling she'll say there's nothing to worry about yet anyway.  I'm ok if this isn't the month.  I'm not really counting on it.  I think it's working to not worry about it.  (At least it's better on my mind, if not my body).  I haven't even been monopolizing the posts with TTC stuff during my 2ww.  I didn't really want to have a baby that close to Christmas anyway, January or February would be better timing.  Now I'll just wait this week out and hopefully not have to waste a test if she arrives Thursday as scheduled.

        My Symptoms  I feel much better this week.  I have hardly any nausea, although I'm still being picky about what I eat.  Speaking of eating, I'm hungry!  All the time.  I eat every two to three hours, but still not everything sounds that great.  Unless it's potatos.  Mashed, french fries, chips, I don't care.  I thought fatigue was getting better, but this weekend really wiped me out.  Maybe I haven't been as tired because I've been going to bed early and napping whenever I get the chance.  The waistline is also expanding.  I'm still seriously considering wearing maternity tomorrow.  Nothing too obvious, but my regular clothes are just too tight.  If only I had a real belly instead of just looking fat.  I promise to do another belly picture soon.  What else, oh yes.  The heartbeat.  I love the sound.  I listen twice a day.  The baby must move around alot too.  It's never in the same place and there are some weird sounds that just might be movement.  I can't wait until I get to feel it.  Ok, here's what the resources say will happen this week.   The Baby  Your baby weighs between 0.3 and 0.5 ounce (8 to 14g), and crown-to-rump length is almost 2.5 inches.  The baby's size has almost doubled in the past 3 weeks.  Length of the baby is a better measure at this time than fetal weight.  Few, if any, stuctures in the baby are formed after this week in pregnancy.  However, the structures already formed continue to grow and develop.  At your 12-week visit (or close to that time), you'll probably be able to hear your baby's heartbeat!  The skeletal system now has center of bone formation in most bones.  Fingers and toes have separate, and nails are growing.  Scattered rudiments of hair appear on the body.  External genitalia are beginning to show distinct signs of male or female sex characteristics. The fetal nervous system has developed further.  Your baby is moving inside your uterus, but you won't feel it for a while yet.  The fetus’s urinary tract is on line, and the fingernails are growing. A big portion of the amniotic fluid from this point on will be baby urine.  Your fetus is looking like a baby and has advanced to the stage that its brain can transmit messages. Vocal chords are complete, and the child can and does sometimes cry (silently). The brain is fully formed, and the child can feel pain. The fetus may even suck his thumb. The eyelids now cover the eyes, and will remain shut until the seventh month to protect the delicate optical nerve fibers.  Your baby's hit the 2-inch mark (about the size of a lime) and weighs half an ounce. Her face is beginning to look more human. Her eyes, which started out on the sides of her head, have moved closer together on her face, and her ears are near their final positions on the sides of her head. Your baby's intestines, which have grown so rapidly that they protrude into the umbilical cord, will start to move into her abdominal cavity about now. Her kidneys are secreting urine into her bladder. Her nerve cells have been multiplying rapidly, and synapses (neurological pathways in the brain) are forming. Your baby may have acquired more reflexes by now, including sucking, and she'll even squirm if you prod your abdomen, though you still won't be able to feel her movement for several weeks.  While your baby's brain is not the same size it will be at birth, it does have the same structure. Bile is being secreted by this time. S/he weighs about 14 grams and is approximately 3.54 inches in total length.Your baby has its reflexes and also practice movements in the digestive tract. All of this in preparation for extrauterine life. If your practitioner uses a doppler, you may be able to hear your baby's heart beat at this office visit. It will sound very fast. Some say that they hear clicking or the sounds of horse hooves. Either way it is a joyous sound to hear! Your risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced once you hear this sound.    The Mom  By the end of 12 weeks, your uterus is too large to remain completely in your pelvis.  You may feel it above your pubic bone.  The uterus has a remarkable ability to grow while you're pregnant.  Before pregnancy, your uterus is almost solid.  It hold about 0.3 ounce or less.  The uterus changes during pregnancy into a comparatively thin-walled, muscular container big enougth to hold the fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid.  When your baby is born, your uterus weighs almost 40 ounces comapred to only 2.5 ounces before pregnancy.  You are probably starting to feel better than you have for most of your pregnancy.  At this point, morning sickness often begins to improve.  You aren't extremely big and are probably still quite comfortable.  If it's your first pregnancy, you may still be wearing regular clothes.  If you've had other pregnancies, you may start to show earlier and feel more comfortable in looser clothing, such as maternity clothes.  You are right on schedule if you've gained 3-10 pounds. Now is a good time to record your growth in your pregnancy journal. Your uterus now rises above your pubic bone. YOU can tell you’re pregnant -- can anybody else?  Heartburn and indigestion are common side effects of pregnancy. Try eating small meals more often, avoiding greasy and fatty foods, and sleeping with your top half elevated. Tums (all calcium) are fine -- and have the added advantage of giving you some of the calcium your body needs!  Your uterus is rising above your pelvic bones, and your practitioner can now feel the top of it (the fundus) low in your abdomen. Though you probably won't need maternity clothes for several more weeks yet, you've no doubt noticed that your waist is thickening and that you're more comfortable in looser, less restrictive clothing.  You may also start getting heartburn (also called acid indigestion), a burning sensation that often extends from the bottom of your breastbone to your lower throat. It's caused by both hormonal and physical changes in your body — and can take the pleasure out of eating a meal or sleeping. Eating small meals and avoiding foods that make the problem worse, such as fried, spicy, or fatty foods, can help.  You may actually start feeling better from your extreme tiredness and nausea this week. Others will hang on to it for awhile longer. Your abdomen may start expanding, especially if this is not your first pregnancy.   Your placenta will take over the production of hormones around this time. If you have suffered from corpus luteum cysts they may begin to dissolve now. Your risk of miscarriage is reduced even further.

       So, today's drama.    Our office closed early today for the Memorial Day Weekend holiday.  I was leaving the parking garage at about 12:30 p.m.  Now I should preface this by saying this parking garage is a little crazy.  Some of the ramps are two way and people go around corners pretty quickly.  Anyway, I was coming around the last corner on the way down to the exit.  And a guy driving an Infiniti SUV was coming around the corner on the way up.  I usually do a pretty good job staying in my lane, so I'm pretty sure I was on my side, but he swung around the corner pretty quickly and hit my car.  I saw him coming and almost stopped, but there wasn't really much I could do.  The front of his car (left bumper area) hit my drivers side rear door and crunched it up pretty good.  It also damaged the back quarter-panel where the wheel well is.    We had a very polite professional exchange of information.  He didn't have his wallet with insurance information on him, so he had to call his Dad to bring it down.  Apparently he works in the building in his father's law firm.  There were two people standing in the area who we took names as witnesses, but I didn't ask them what they saw.  I figure we'll let the insurance companies sort it out.  He certainly wasn't admitting fault, but I gotta figure, even if I was slightly on his side (which I don't think I was) he should have been driving slow enough that he could have stopped before running into the side of my car.  I called Eric when we were done.  He freaked out a bit and told me I should go to the hospital, etc.  He was worried about the baby.  I compromised and told him I would call my doctor and tell them what happened.  If they thought I should come in or go to the hospital I would.  Otherwise, I was fine.  He agreed.  I called and talked to the nurse.  Being that it was a low speed impact (under 20 mph), the airbag didn't deploy, and I didn't hit anything (steering wheel, etc.) She said I should be fine.  There isn't much she can do.  She said if I started cramping or bleeding, to go to the ER, and if I was a little sore, I could take Tylenol or use ice or heat packs.  I may be a little sore, but I think we're fine.  I took some time for heartbeat searching this afternoon and the little one is still there beating away.  Now to just get my car fixed.  Grrrr.  I made a claim with my insurance company and have to take my car to the adjuster on Wednesday.  Hopefully, they'll agree it was the other guy's fault and get him to cover my deductible.  One more thing to do next week.  At least no one was hurt.

       I'm sorry about the delay.  I am a few posts behind.  I know we'll have two for today, maybe even three if I take some belly pictures this evening.  So, anyway, about my appoinment.  My appointment was scheduled for 2:30 p.m. yesterday afternoon.  We got there about 5 minutes early and then waited for a long time.  The other negative was they made me pay a copay again.  They said last time was just an ultrasound visit and since it wasn't my "first appointment", I still owed the copay for that.  I didn't really agree, but whatever, even if this baby costs $40 in doctor's fees, I'm still getting a deal.  I didn't end up seeing the doctor until about 3:15 p.m.  When they took me back I had to leave a urine sample, get weighed, and blood pressure taken.  Apparently all seems fine there.  Then the nurse asked me to undress from the waist down and wait on the table for Dr. D.  The doctor came in and asked how we were doing.  Briefly went over my history to be sure nothing had changed, (i.e., was I satisfied with my negative HIV test from August and didn't need to be tested again, etc.)  Then she did a quick Pap.  After all that stuff, we got to the interesting part, another ultrasound.  As soon, as we saw the baby I immediately noticed how much bigger it was than last time.  They do the measurements in milimeters and the first time it was 13, now it is 36.5.  To translate for those of us who aren't that great with metric.  Before it was about a 1/2 inch. Now it is about 1 1/2 inches.  It's tripled in size in the last three weeks.  Before we even started looking for the heartbeat, the baby moved it's head!  It was so cool.  It wasn't movement like it was floating around, but like it jerked it's head.  It was the best part.  Then she showed us the heartbeating again.  She didn't let us linger and look too long.  She printed us two pictures and that was it.  On a sidenote, I need to work on getting the pictures to post.  We tried scanning them at the neighbor's last night, but they kept getting distorted.  After the exam and ultrasound, she asked if we had any questions.  Eric had none, but I asked the important ones.  1.  Can I get my hair colored?  Answer:  Yes.  2.  Can I eat blue cheese?  Especially, dressing on my chicken wings?  Answer:  Yes.  She wants to see me again in 5 weeks.  She mentioned that at that appointment we'll be able to hear the baby.  Eric, then brought up that we rented a Doppler and heard it at home.  She didn't seem upset, but said she was surprised we heard it. She asked if we were sure it was the baby.  She said, she has trouble finding it that early.  I'm pretty sure it was the baby.  I found my heart rate too, and the baby's was much faster and completely different.  Although, sometimes it takes me 10-15 minutes to find it, so I can see why she wouldn't try.  I'm scheduled again for July 1st.  My main goal at that appointment will be to convice her to do a 20 week ultrasound at the end of July, to let us know the sex.  I think I'll tell her that I'm going to have one done and if she won't do it, I'll go somewhere else and pay out of pocket.  I'd rather her do it and have it in my medical records, but if she won't do it until 32 weeks...I just don't want to wait that long.  Also, I've moved my due date to 12/18/04.  My estimate based on estimated ovulation was 12/17, the first ultrasound measurements showed 12/18, this ultrasound lost another day and showed 12/19.  I'll pick the middle one, and say 12/18, which means I'll be 11 weeks officially tomorrow.  I'll do the updates for the upcoming 12th week on Monday after we get back in town.  Now, please read my next post about today's drama.

       I know that everyone made me promise not to play with the Doppler until after my appointment today, but…  It’s Eric’s fault!  Actually, I wasn’t going to tell anyone, but the story is kind of cool, so I’m confessing.  I was expecting two packages when I got home from work.  The Doppler was tucked inside the front door.  My package from Erica was missing from the porch.  I glanced next door and saw a package on the neighbors porch marked “Fragile.”  I told Eric it was probably my box from Erica.  He told me I couldn’t retrieve it until the neighbor came home.  Apparently he didn’t want other neighbors to think I stole packages from doorsteps.  So, the only one to open was the Doppler.  I only wanted to read the instructions, but the Doppler was right there on top.  I picked it up and tried it out on my chest.  My heartbeat started coming out of the speaker.  Then Eric said, “Try me now!”  We put it on his chest and had some difficulty hearing his heartbeat.  Obviously, it was beating, so then we decided to use the gel it came with.  That helped the transmission out and we could hear his heart beating.  Then Eric said, “Now try the baby!”  I said, let’s wait.  At least let me go change out of my work clothes.  He said, “No, try it now.  Try it now!” So, we tried.  At first we couldn’t hear anything, but as I moved the probe around, I got a very strong signal.  It was definitely a pulse.  Eric and I both looked at each other like, “Is this it?”  Then I realized it wasn’t especially fast.  The baby’s heart-rate should be around 120-180 beat per minute.  An adult heart rate is 60-90 beats per minute.  This was definitely slower.  Then I realized the probe was probably positioned right over one of the major arteries headed through the groin region on the way to my leg.  I was hearing my heart-rate again.  Then we decided to listen to the CD of sounds and actually read the instructions.  The CD gave samples of fetal blood flow, a 10 week heart-rate, a 16 week heart-rate, a 30 week heart-rate, placenta sounds, and mother sounds.  I definitely hadn’t heard the baby.  Eric went to play games and I went to make dinner.  One of the tips was that a full bladder might help.  By the time dinner was ready I was feeling “full” so I laid on the couch and tried again.  Still nothing.  I decided not to be concerned, after all the doctor said it might be too early.  Only one more day until the appointment.  After I ate, I had to take some stuff upstairs and decided to take the Doppler and try one more time.  On the way up the stairs I said a little prayer.  “God, I’m not really worried, but it would be so great if you would let me hear my baby.”  I took the CD with me and just listened to the part with the 10 week heart beat so I would have an idea of the speed I was listening for.  I laid on the bed.  This time…jackpot!  It was the right speed and right in the middle, no chance of picking up a vein.  (Thanks, God!)  I went and got Eric and told him I thought I found it.  He agreed!  I even moved over, found my artery and then back to the baby.  They were definitely two different rates.  I ended up getting a good recording.  I’ll try to figure out the downloading part in the next day or so.  I know everyone told me not to do it early.  But, I have no regrets.  I’m even more excited about today’s appointment.  I am 100% sure that everything is fine and the doctor will have no nasty surprises for me today!  I just hope we get to do an ultrasound now and see the little peanut!  Although, even if we only get to listen, it’s a sound I’ll never get tired of.  Hearing it on my own didn’t make it any less special.  If anything, I know that I was the first person to ever hear my child’s heartbeat.  Eric was close behind, but we got to share that ourselves, before the doctor is involved.  Now she can do the medical part and tell us the rate, etc. etc.  I’m on top of the world today.  Come on 2:30 p.m.  I’m ready for you!

       The bad thing about writing in a journal is that when you change your mind, everyone knows.  You may have noticed that I've been trying to decide on if/when to rent a Doppler to listen to the baby's heartbeat at home.  First, I decided I wanted to order one after we heard the heartbeat at the doctor for the first time.  Then, in case that doesn't happen this week, I thought maybe I'd order it anyway after Thursday's appointment.  Now I started thinking that I'm going to see most of our family this weekend.  Saturday we're having a get together with my brother-in-law and family, and my mother-in-law, Sunday we're going to my Grandparents house and my parents and brother will be there.  Wouldn't it be cool if I already had the doppler and they could hear the heartbeat too?  Of course it would!  So I ordered it today.  Here's the  urlLink link .  For a mere $32  per month.  I rented one that allows you to record the heartbeat so it should be fairly easy to download to the computer and thus, link to this webpage.  If all goes according to my plan, I'll only have it for 2 months.  I think by the end of the second month I have it, I should be feeling the baby move.  I'll be willing to give it up if I can have the reassurance of the baby kicking.  So here is the real question.  I ordered today before 6 p.m., so it will be shipped today.  And, "Units shipped within the United States are guaranteed to arrive within 2-3 business days from date of shipment."  That means it will be here on Wednesday or Thursday.  If it comes on Wednesday, do I try it out before my appointment on Thursday?  I'd like to say no.  Maybe I'll just read the instructions and listen to the CD about the different sounds you could hear.  Ideally, it'll show up Thursday and I can bring it in and try it out after my perfect appointment with the doctor.  Do we wanna take bets?  Do I have enough willpower?

       It's that time of week again, I've decided to add a section to my normal format for what I'm feeling.  Here we go.   My Symptoms/Feelings  I've had a pretty good week.  Not as much nausea and it seems like the fatigue let up a bit.  Most of the time it makes me happy, but other times nerves creep in a little.  I'm really glad I have an appointment this week that should help calm the nerves and have me relax again.  I also think I've gotten rid of the constipation problem.  Maybe eating the cereal daily helps?  Today was bad.  Last night I went to bed with a headache that was still there when I woke up.  I took Tylenol twice, but oh how I miss the Imitrex.  It made me really nauseous too, but it let up a bit around 1:00 p.m.  My chest seems more sensitive this week and I think it may have had a growth spurt.  I went bra shopping on Saturday and seem to be in between a C and D cup.  I also feel like my belly's "popped" a bit.  I had someone notice at work on Friday that I seem to be getting close to "showing."  I'm really going to try to hold off at least one more week before I switch clothes though.  I plan on doing pictures and measurements again on Thursday or Friday.  That's about it.  Here's the rest of what's going on.   The Baby  By this week, the crown-to-rump length of your baby is 1.75 to 2.4 inches.  Fetal weight is about .3 ounces (8g).  Your baby is about the size of a large lime.  Fetal growth is rapid now.  The crown-to-rump length of your baby doubles in the next 3 weeks.  The head is almost half of the baby's entire length.  As the head extends, the chin rises from the chest, and the neck develops and lengthens.  Fingernails appear.  External genitalia are beginning to show distinguishing features.  Development of teh fetus into a male or female is complete in another 3 weeks.  Your fig-sized baby is now fully formed — measuring 1 1/2 inches long and weighing in at a quarter of an ounce. His skin is still transparent, allowing many of his blood vessels to show through. Some of his bones are beginning to harden, and tiny toothbuds are starting to appear under his gums. His fingers and toes have separated, and he may soon be able to open and close his fists. He's already busy kicking and stretching, and his tiny movements are so fluid they look like water ballet. These movements will increase as his body grows and becomes more developed and functional. As his diaphragm develops, your tiny tenant may also start to get the hiccups. Because he's still so small, though, you won't feel any of his workouts or intrauterine gulps until sometime between weeks 16 and 20.  It’s the size of a softball in there! Can you feel it?  The little guy (or gal) is about 2.5 inches long, and weighs about 14 grams.  All major organs have been formed. After the end of this week, the risk of congenital abnormalities goes down. That doesn’t mean drinking and smoking are okay!  If you have seen pictures of babies at this stage you will notice that the head is about 1/2 of the body size. This will change as the baby grows. The iris will begin to develop this week and finger nails appear! Your baby weighs about 7 grams.    The Mom  While big changes are occurring in your baby, changes are probably happening more slowly in you.  You are almost at the end of your first trimester; your uterus has been growing along with the fetus inside it. It is almost big enough to fill your pelvis and may be felt in your lower abdomen, above teh middle of your pubic bone.  You won't be able to feel your baby moving yet.  If you think you feel your baby move at this time, you either have gas or are farther along in your pregnancy than you thought.  Some women notice changes in their hair, fingernails or toenails during pregnancy.  This doesn't happen to everyone, but if it happens to you, don't worry about it.  Some fortunate women notice an increase in hair and nail growth during pregnancy.  Others find they lose some hair during this time.  Don't worry if nausea has made it impossible for you to eat a wide variety of healthy foods or if you haven't put on much weight yet (most women gain between two and five pounds during the first trimester). Your appetite will likely return soon and you'll start to gain about a pound a week.  Feeling extra flushed? Light-complexioned women may actually become quite pink during pregnancy. That’s because of the added volume of blood in your body. And speaking of blood, watch your iron count. Are you taking your prenatal vitamins?  Weight gain is a concern of a lot of women during pregnancy. By this stage of pregnancy most women have gained very little weight. Generally we say that you will gain about 1-2 lbs. a month in the first trimester. Some women will actually lose weight and be perfectly fine, particularly if they were ill. Some will gain no weight whatsoever. While yet others will gain 10+ pounds. The key is a healthy diet.  However, your focus should be on nutrition rather than weight. Despite folk lore, you are not eating for two, but you should make everything you eat count. You will only need about 300-500 calories extra a day while you are pregnant.  Avoid junk foods, and try to ensure that you are getting a variety of fruits and vegetables and protein. One word about protein, even in pregnancy it does not have to come from meat. There are a lot of successful vegetarian pregnancies.

       I just wanted to post because I took my 2nd CPCU test this morning.  I was not as prepared as I should have been and I think a big part of my grouchiness the past week or two was due to the fact that I needed to be studying and didn't want to!  It was so boring.  I cracked the books last night around 6:30 p.m. and studied until 10:30 p.m.  I was really not enjoying it, but I think I soaked up enough to pass the test (I hope!).  The center said I'll get the results in 6 weeks, but last time I got them via e-mail after about a week.  At least I can sit and do nothing without guilt now!  Although, I have questions for tomorrow's Sunday School class I haven't completed...

       I don’t know why I have no desire to work on Fridays.  Today I really just want to go back to bed and now that I think about it, I’m ravenously hungry too.  Ok, I’m back from Starbucks.  Just picked up a bagel with cream cheese and hot chocolate.  They didn’t have cinnamon raisin bagels though, so I’m a bit disappointed.    Today is 10 weeks.  I’ve had a pretty good week.  The nausea doesn’t seem as bad as last week.  And even the fatigue has been more manageable.  I still feel pregnant though, so I’m not really concerned about symptoms getting better.  I feel like baby and I have had another growth spurt.  I think bra shopping should be done soon.  I also feel like my belly is growing a bit.  I’ll do pictures next week after my doctor’s appointment.  I’m not sure when I’ll switch to maternity.  I can still button my pants right now (although, some are definitely uncomfortable).  Some people suggest rubberbands, etc. to help prolong your time in regular clothes, but I think by then, I’ll just switch.  The weird part now, is that I don’t look “pregnant”  even though clothes aren’t fitting right, I think I’d feel silly in maternity clothes.  The other thing I can’t stop thinking about is my appointment in 6 days.  I’m afraid this will be the longest week in history.  I’m mostly excited and just a tiny bit scared.  I keep telling myself things are completely different this time.  Remember last time I had no symptoms?  Also, I’ve already seen the baby larger than last time.  I just think it freaks me out a bit that this is again my first appointment with my doctor.  I’m sure it’ll be fine and if we get to do another ultrasound…The baby should be much easier to make out parts.  We should be able to see arms and legs, probably even facial features.  There should be lots of movement and definitely a strong heartbeat.  It’ll be great.  Even if we only get to “hear” the heartbeat, that sound is magical.  I was reading someone else’s blog with a sound file attached and the sound of that baby’s heartbeat almost made me cry.  The plus side if we hear the heartbeat is that maybe then, I’ll rent my own monitor.  I think I’d like to rent a monitor until I can feel the baby move, but I want the first time I hear the heartbeat to be at the doctors office.  Meaning, if we hear it next week, I can order the monitor, if not, I’ll wait another month.  Ok, I don’t really have much more to say.  I suppose I should attempt to be somewhat productive at work.  I’m just hoping next week goes by quickly.  I have the doctor on Thursday, and then we’re spending the weekend with family.  Friday night and Saturday with my brother-in-law, sister-in-law, nieces, and mother-in-law, and then Sunday with Mom & Dad, Jeremy, and Grandma and Grandpa.  It’ll be so cool to see them, hopefully, with new pictures!  Also, in summer clothes, I’ll probably be wearing maternity.  My non-pregnant shorts definitely don’t fit.  Ok, really, back to work.

       Yesterday, my pregnancy affected my brain.  Here are two instances.   1.  This wasn’t a big deal, but I finally couldn’t take the wondering and broke down and called the nurse line at the doctor’s office.  I’m sure they write down every call, so I’m so glad that this one made me file, but anyway, I didn’t want to wait until my appointment to figure out what they would do.  I asked the nurse if they would be able to hear the baby’s heartbeat at my next appointment since I’d be almost 11 weeks along.  Her answer was maybe.  She said 11 weeks is borderline on whether they can hear it.  Based on factors like body composition (meaning layers of fat), position of the baby, etc.  She said the next appointment for sure.  However, she said that she thinks Dr. D will do another ultrasound.  I’m so excited!  Thinking more logically, that makes sense.  If I followed the office’s “normal” schedule, I would have had my first appointment with ultrasound at 9-11 weeks.  My next appointment 1 month later, they would definitely hear a heartbeat at 13-15 weeks.  Since, however, I had an ultrasound at 8 weeks, and another appt. 3 weeks later, I may get a second ultrasound.  There is no way they’ll do my appointment and let me leave without some “sign of life” be it a heartbeat heard via Doppler or seen via ultrasound.  No matter what, I should have some contact with the baby’s heart next week.  That makes me happy.  2.  This was STUPID.  I went to the grocery store after work.  I successfully shopped.  I loaded my trunk, I returned the cart to the rack, I got my keys, and I drove home.  When I arrived home, I reached for my purse to head inside.  It was gone.  What I mean is, I LEFT IT IN THE CART IN THE PARKING LOT!  I immediately drove (slightly above the speed limit) back to the grocery store.  I said many prayers asking for forgiveness for my carelessness and asking for a break.  One thing that really concerned me was that I’d taken my ultrasound pictures to work for Tammy to see, so they were still in my purse.  Credit cards and checks can be cancelled, but pictures…  I got back to the store, nothing was in the parking lot.  I headed inside and luckily, a very nice man had turned in my purse (with all contents intact.)  The girl behind the counter told me she had just called my house and told my husband that they had my purse.  That was my next worry.  I left my purse at the ballet on the way out less than two weeks ago and he had to go back and get it.  He saw I was upset enough though, and luckily didn’t try to make me feel any worse.  It worked out in the end, but I’ve got to get my act together!

       In case you are interested here is my weekend update.   Friday  Of course, I went to work.  I had some motivation problems, but managed to stick it out all day.  Eric called and did my grocery shopping for me.  When I got home, I did a little picking up and prepared for our Neighbor cookout.  At 6:30 p.m. our new neighbors from across the street (Chris & Erica) and April and Martin came over to grill out.  We had a pretty good visit.  Eric grilled me a steak, which I managed to eat most of (yeah! Meat!), I also made homemade mac & cheese, and the neighbors brought over cheese dip.  We had a pretty good visit and seemed to like the new neighbors pretty well.  They said next time, they can host.  Chris and Erica left around 10:00 p.m. and then we played Phase 10 with April and Martin.  Personally, I was ready for bed, but Eric wasn’t ready to let the night die at 10:00 p.m.  I ended up losing badly, but considered it a victory when I got to go to bed.   Saturday  I slept in for a bit.  Then I really was in the mood to go shopping.  I convinced Eric to go with me with the promise of X-Box Live.  We first went to the mall and stopped at Sears on the way in.  I found a couple of things that seemed cute, and bought them.  Then we went to Motherhood Maternity.  We went a bit crazy.  Eric was so cute, picking out clothes for me to try on.  After I tried stuff on, I started the decision process of what I want versus what I will buy.  Eric was of the mind, that I’d need it eventually, so if I wanted it, buy it.  I should take him shopping more often!  After handing over the credit card, we then stopped at JC Penney, just to “see” what they had.  All maternity was 50% off, so I bought 4 more shirts.  I ended up spending close to $300 on clothes, but bought 2 pair of jean shorts, 1 pair of jeans, 1 pair of work pants, 11 shirts, and 2 tank tops.  I should be set through the summer though.  I’ll need more clothes when I outgrow the pants I bought and when it starts getting cold.  After my shopping spree we headed to Best Buy for X-Box Live.  Now the starter kit with a 1 year subscription is only $70.  However, we then had to buy a router to split the DSL to go to the computer and X-Box, and a Wireless adapter, so we didn’t have to run a cable from the upstairs computer room, to the basement.  I also let him buy another game, so $250 later…we headed home.  Shopping wore me out, so I took a nap and then around 5:00 started helping Eric try to set up the routers.  There were problems, but finally around 10 p.m. we had it up and running.  That made it about my bed time, so after trying on all of my maternity clothes one more time, I headed for bed.   Sunday  We had church in the morning.  Right after I got up, I had a call from work that one of my client’s had a fire, but there wasn’t much we could do on Sunday morning, so I knew that would be waiting on me this morning.  After church, again I napped and then we went to a church picnic from 4 to 7 p.m.  I should have spent the evening studying for my CPCU exam that is in less than a week, but I just watched TV.

       Here's my update for this week.  I've already discussed most of how I'm feeling.  Not really much has changed except that I now feel like I'm starting to expand (see previous post).  I'm really looking forward to another doctor appointment in a week and a half, but feel like things must still be progressing, because I feel pretty yucky.  Ok, so here is the what is happening inside post.   The Baby  By the 10th week of pregnancy, the crown-to-rump length of your growing baby is about 1.25 to 1.68 inches.  At this time, we can start measuring how much the baby weighs.  Before this week, the weight was too small to measure weekly differences.  Now that the baby is starting to put on a little weight, weight is included in this section.  The baby weighs close to 0.18 ounce (5g) and is the size of a small plum.  The end of week 10 is the end of the embryonic period.  At this time, the fetal period begins.  It is characterized by rapid growth of the fetus when the three germ layers are established.   During the embryonic period, the embryo was most susceptible to things that could interfere with its development.  Most congenital malformations occur before the end of week 10.  It is encouraging to know that a critical part of your baby's development is safely behind you.  By the end of week 10, development of organ systems and the body are well under way.  Your baby is beginning to look more human.  Your baby is no longer an embryo! Though she's barely the size of a kumquat — just an inch or so long, crown to bottom — and weighs less than a quarter of an ounce, she now has completed the most critical portion of her development. This is the beginning of the so-called fetal period, a time when the tissues and organs in her body rapidly grow and mature. Her vital organs — the liver, kidney, intestines, brain, and lungs — are now in place and starting to function (although they'll continue to develop throughout your pregnancy). Her liver continues to make blood cells, and the yolk sac, which previously supplied these cells, is no longer needed and begins to disappear.  During the next three weeks, your baby's length will more than double to nearly 3 inches. Her head is proportionately smaller now than it was a few weeks ago, but it's still almost half the length of her entire body. Her forehead temporarily bulges with her developing brain and sits high on her head; it will later recede to give her a more human appearance. Each day, more minute details — including tiny fingernails, toenails, and peach-fuzz hair — start to appear on her body. Her fingers are now completely separated; her arms bend at the elbow and curve slightly; her hands are flexed at the wrist and meet over her heart; her legs are lengthening; and her feet may be long enough to meet in front of her body. She is busily swallowing amniotic fluid and kicking her legs.  If you could take a peek at your baby this week, you'd be able to clearly see the outline of her spine through her parchment-thin skin. Spinal nerves are beginning to stretch out from her spinal cord.  Boy or Girl? The external genitalia are becoming clearly defined. The embryo is moving but can’t yet be felt.   The baby now enters it's fetal period. The average size is approximately 27-35 mm crown to rump length (CRL), or 1.06-1.38 inches. S/he weighs in at 4 grams, or 4 paper clips. Tiny toes have formed. The eyes are largely open, but the eyelids are beginning to fuse, and will stay that way until 25-27 weeks. External genitalia is beginning to differentiate. External ears are completely formed, as well as the upper lip. The biggest accomplishment this week is the disappearance of the tail!   The Mom  Changes are gradual, and you still may not show much.  You may be thinking about and looking at maternity clothes, but you probably don't need them just yet.    Your uterus has doubled in size by now. Before you got pregnant, it was the size of a small pear. By this week, it's grown to the size of a grapefruit. At your next prenatal visit, you may be able to hear your baby's rapid heartbeat with the help of a Doppler, a hand-held soundwave stethoscope that your practitioner will pass over your belly. Many women say that the beating of their baby's tiny heart sounds like the thunder of galloping horses and hearing it for the first time is one of the greatest joys of the first trimester.  Is somebody a little MOODY? Wild highs and truly horrendous lows, sudden mood swings, and "crazy" behavior are typical during pregnancy. Some of this is due to hormones, and some of it is because this is, truly, a VERY emotional time!  Take time for some light and funny reading.  Fatigued? Many pregnant women spend the first few months so exhausted they can barely hold their heads up. Try to take naps, go to bed early, and delegate as much work as you can to others. Remember that you’re working incredibly hard. Your body is growing another human being!  Gaining weight? And what about those breasts? Time to support yourself! Get a bigger, more bountiful bra. Budget a little extra money -- you’ll be needing a still BIGGER one after baby is born!  You are still tired, and nauseated, hang on only a few more weeks for most of you! Your abdomen may begin to pooch out, but it will be more from bowel distension than the uterus. Your waistline is slowly disappearing! Remember to measure your waist and belly now! Comparing later can be a lot of fun!

       Ok, so I joined the group and changed my template.  I think everythings working now.  The only downside, is I lost all of my old comments, but I think the new ones will work better.  Let me know if there's anything I should adjust.

       I should probably start doing this at the same time as my belly pictures, but tonight I felt the need to compare my measurements to my "before" measurements.  The good news, I've only grown in appropriate areas.  I may find a place to post this on the side, but here are my current stats at 9 weeks 1 day compared to 1 week before conception.  Before = (B) Current =(C)  Weight - 150.5 (B), 149.5 (C) = -1 pound Bicep - 11 3/4 (B), 11 3/4 (C) = No change Chest - 35 1/2 (B), 37 (C) = +1 1/2 inches Waist (at smallest point) - 30 (B), 31 1/2 (C) = +1 1/2 inches Waist (at belly button) - 32 1/2 (B), 34 1/2 (C) = +2 inches Hips - 38 (B), 38 (C) = No change Thigh - 23 (B), 22 1/2 (C) = - 1/2 inch Calf - 14 (B), 14 (C) = No change  Like I said, I'm ok with that.  I new my chest had grown.  I guess this also proves that my waistline is expanding.  The plus side is that I haven't gained any weight so far and also haven't gained in my hips and thighs.  Now, I know that this will change, but for the first trimester, I can handle this.

       I’m nine weeks today!  I had a dream last night/this morning that when I went to the bathroom there was blood.  It was just a dream.  I was a little nervous on my first trip to the bathroom this morning, but everything’s still fine.  My doctor was hanging out at my house in the dream too, so that’s a bit weird.  I still feel like crap today, so I think the baby’s in there stirring up trouble.  This has been a tough week.  I’ve been complaining a lot and don’t really know how to deal with my total lack of energy.  I guess a lot has been going on in there.  The baby has almost doubled in size in the last week.  I’m just ready for this trimester to get over so I can wake up and have energy and be able to eat whatever I want!

       Yesterday was my three year anniversary.  Eric was great.   I wasn’t as great.  Tuesday night he came home and had a present (already wrapped) and card.  He also told me that he had made dinner plans, so not to worry about it.  Remember, this is the day  before  the anniversary.  I hadn’t done anything.  So yesterday morning, he let me open my card and gift before work.  The card was cute and the gift was a musical picture frame.  It had the Corinthians love passage in it, “Love is patient, love is kind, love is not envious, …”  We had used that verse on bookmarks we made as favors for our wedding.  It was sweet but not too expensive, so it took a lot of the pressure off since I hadn’t got him anything yet.  I planned to go to the mall during lunch, but my need to find something I could eat won out.  I ended up stopping at the convenience store in our building at work and buying a card on my way home.  Don’t get me wrong, it was  a nice card.  We had dinner reservations at 7:30 p.m.  Eric didn’t tell me where.  We ended up going to the Melting Pot.  It was very nice.   When they took us to our table there was a vase of three roses with three balloons tied to it.  It was very sweet.  I don’t have problems eating cheese or apples or bread, so the cheese fondue was good.  I also could eat the salad.  I couldn’t eat as much of the meat.  I don’t know why any meat product is unappetizing, but I just eat what I can. Dessert was good too, but I was just a little too full to eat much.  When they brought out the dessert, the waiter also brought a Polaroid camera and took our picture.  Then he gave us a little Melting Pot frame to put it in.  I just thought it was so sweet that he thought ahead.  It was a very nice anniversary.  I felt a little bad I didn’t get Eric a gift, but he didn’t seem to mind.  Although, he did mention Xbox Live again.  I may have to break down.  If you didn’t know, I bought Eric Xbox Live for Christmas.  I thought it was perfect and he’d love it.  He made me take it back.  He said he didn’t have any desire to play with people he didn’t know.  However, about two months ago, our neighbor got Xbox Live and now Eric thinks it’s the greatest thing in the world.  I’m sure he’ll get it (again) sooner or later.

       I've been told that I need to provide more information about what I'm experiencing rather than just the textbook type updates.  So here's a post about the good, the bad, and the ugly of the third month of pregnancy (barely!).   The Good  - I'm pregnant! - No period. - I've lost 2 to 3 pounds. - Up a bra size. - My fingernails are growing at an incredible rate.   The Bad  - Morning Sickness.  While I still have not actually vomited, I still feel nauseous most days.  I'm learning a pattern though.  Mornings are worse, usually between 8 and 11.  The key is to eat in the morning before I start to feel bad and then keep eating all day before I get hungry.  If I start to get hungry, I get nauseous and lose my appetite.   - Food Aversions or Cravings.  Nothing in particular, but I've been wanting more complex carbs and less protein.  I've also had a bit of a craving for milk.  I've also cut a back a bit on the apples.  Now I'm doing applesauce. - Breast Tenderness.  This is actually pretty tolerable.  I get uncomfortable sleeping on my stomach sometimes, but I don't notice pain on a daily basis. - Excess Gas.  This has manifested in a variety of forms from lots of belching, to...other forms of gas release. - Constipation.  I never was really sure what this really meant, but think I'm getting it now.  It hasn't been bad enough to try any type of remedies, but things have definately slowed down. - Fatigue.  This has actually been tolerable too.  I get tired, especially after lunch and right around 5p.m.  Sometimes I come home and take a nap, but then I have trouble going to sleep at bedtime. - Emotional Instability - I am definately more sensitive.  I'm more irritable and get sad easily.  I cried twice Sunday.  Once because I felt sick and once because I was overcome by love for my baby.  I think Eric is a bit frightened.   The Ugly  - Acne.  I feel like a teenager again.  Luckily, I've never had "bad" skin, so my breakouts now are just one or two blemishes, but it's annoying.  They are also in places other than my face, like chest, arms, and back. - Take a look at my first  urlLink belly picture .  It looks like I'm growing a belly.  Unfortunately I think some of it was already there and the rest is probably a result of that gas and constipation I mentioned before.  I'm making an area to post all pictures on the side.  See also my  urlLink before picture , this one was taken about a week before I conceived.  I actually weigh about the same or even a little less than my before picture.  Ok, hopefully, that's some good information for now.  I'll try to do better on my symptom updates.  Hopefully, the next one will be a "real" belly or the disappearance of the morning sickness.  Things will start getting interesting in another month or two.

       I should be getting back to work, but thought I’d try to do a quick weekend update.   Friday  After work we went home, had some dinner (I ate a box of Mac&Cheese, my diet is seriously weird now).  Then we went to the ballet at 8 p.m.  It was actually pretty good.  There wasn’t a story like when we went to see Dracula, but they did three distinct types of music and dance and it was really entertaining.  After the ballet we came home and watched Runaway Jury.  It was really good, so I’m glad we watched it before returning as it was 2 days late already.   Saturday  I wanted to sleep in a little since I knew I wouldn’t get a nap.  I got up about 10:00 a.m. , ate some cereal (a good choice because I wasn’t nauseous that morning) and then left to do some errands.  I had to go to the mall to pick up a gift certificate for Samara (I knew what I was getting her, just was tardy about actually going to get it), I also picked up a gift for my Mother-In-Law for Mother’s Day and got a new (larger) strapless bra for me.  I also picked up Eric a new pair of pants and shirt, as he refuses to go shopping and some of the things he leaves the house in are almost embarrassing.  Then I took the movie back and stopped by the bank to get some cash for the weekend.  I made it home around noon and got ready for the graduation.  We picked Will up and drove up to Ashland to watch Samara graduate.  The graduation was outside and it was a beautiful day (maybe a bit warm, but I’m not complaining).  She got her Masters and then we headed back to their place for a cookout.  It was fun.  There was good food and I got to meet or spend some time with some of Samara’s other friends and family and it was really nice.  We left around 10 p.m. and headed home.  I was wiped out, so I went to bed around 11 p.m.   Sunday  I got up around 9 a.m. and cooked Eric Biscuits and Gravy for breakfast.  It didn’t sound appetizing for me, so I didn’t eat, which I paid for by feeling very sick around 10:30 a.m.  We left at a little after 10 to go to the pharmacy to pick up my vitamin refill and when I got back to the car, I felt awful.  I started crying and Eric was a bit freaked out by my pregnancy mood swing.  He was extremely nice though, and offered to stop anywhere I wanted on the chance there was something I could buy that would make me feel normal again.  I actually bought some fruit snacks and after eating them felt better and was able to eat a nutria-grain bar.  The moral to the story, eat as soon as I get up, even if I feel fine and am not that hungry.  Anyway, we drove down to Cincinnati.  We had plans to go a Reds game and meet my Mother-In-Law, Brother-In-Law, Sister-In-Law, and 2 nieces.  We made it around 12:15, but they got stuck in traffic, so we didn’t go in until almost 1:00 p.m.  We had great seats though, but they were in the sun and I’m sporting a nice sunburn now as proof.  We had fun at the game and a good visit, so after the game we headed back home.  I tried calling my Mom on the way home, but she was out boating, but Grandma was there visiting so I got to talk to her a bit.  After we got home, I showered and threw on my comfy clothes.  I got to talk to Mom for about 10 minutes and then we had to get off the phone so we could both watch the Survivor Finale.  We, of course, went next door and watched the three hours of coverage.  I love Survivor.  After that, we headed home and again, I collapsed.  It was a very busy weekend.  Now today I’ll have to catch up on my “weekend” chores.  Laundry, grocery, etc.

       Before I head to bed, here is the development update for this week.  I'll try to do a weekend update tomorrow.   The Baby  The crown-to-rump length of the embryo is .9 inch to 1.2 inches (22 to 30 mm).  This is close to the size of a medium green olive.  If you could look inside your uterus, you'd see many changes in your baby.  Your baby's arms and legs are longer.  Hands are flexed at the wrist and meet over the heart area.  They continue to extend in front of the body.  Fingers are longer, and the tips are slightly enlarged where touch pads are developing.  The feet are approaching the midline of the body and may be long enough to meet in front of the torso.  The head is more erect, and the neck is more developed.  The eyelids almost cover the eyes.  Up to this time, the eyes have been uncovered.  External ears are evident and well formed.  Your baby now moves its body and limbs.  This movemembet may be seen during an ultrasound exam.  The baby looks mor recognizable as a human being, although it is still extremely small.  It is probably impossible to distinguish a male from a female.  External organs of the male and female appear very similar and will not be distinguishable for another few weeks.  Your new resident is nearly an inch long — barely the size of a grape — and weighs just a fraction of an ounce, but he's poised for rapid weight gain now that his basic physical structure is in place. He's also starting to look more and more human. His embryonic "tail" is now completely gone and his body parts — including organs, muscles, and nerves — are kicking into gear.  His eyelids are fused shut and won't open until 27 weeks. He has earlobes, and by week's end, the inner workings of his ears will be complete. His upper lip is fully formed, too, and his mouth, nose, and nostrils are more distinct. The tips of his fingers are slightly enlarged where his touch pads are developing. All major joints — his shoulders, elbows, wrists, knees, and ankles — are working, enabling your baby to move his limbs. As for his heart, it has divided into four chambers now, and the valves have started to develop. External sex organs are there, but won't be distinguishable as male or female for another few weeks.  Help! What's that dull cramping? As the uterus begins to stretch, you may feel a dull aching and cramping. You may even find a slight brownish or reddish discharge. So long as the cramping is not severe, and the spotting is not bright red, you are probably just fine. Your uterus is beginning to grow, and the sensation you feel is the "round" ligaments beginning to stretch. This should lessen in the second and third trimester.  We have elbows! Your baby is now approximately 13-17 mm crown to rump length, or about 0.51 - 0.66 inches. S/he also weighs in at 1 gram! Toe rays are present as the toes begin to form. Gonads have become testes (for boys) or ovaries (for girls). Baby will move away if touched through the uterine wall, and can spontaneously move as well. Ossification (hardening) of the bones may begin.   The Mom  Each week your uterus grows larger with the baby growing inside it.  You may begin to see your waistline growing thicker by this time.  A pelvic exam will detect a uterus a little bigger than a grapefruit.  You still may not look pregnant (although your belly will probably pop earlier if you've been pregnant before), but emotionally you may feel like you're on a roller coaster ride. Mood swings are common now; it's perfectly normal to feel alternately elated and terrified about becoming a parent. This feeling can persist throughout your pregnancy and well after your baby's born. Try to cut yourself some slack. Almost all expectant parents worry about how a new baby will change their lives, but the vast majority later say that becoming a parent was one of the best things they've ever done.  You may be feeling extra gassy or bloated now, too. That's primarily because the major doses of progesterone your body produces early in pregnancy relax smooth muscle tissue throughout your body, and that includes your gastrointestinal tract. This relaxation slows your digestive processes, which can cause more gas, bloating, burping, flatulence, and generally miserable sensations in your gut, especially after a big meal.  Pregnancy does odd things to your skin. It's all those hormones! Some women break out as though each little pore were Mount Vesuvius. "Kablooey! Thar she blows!" For other, more fortunate women, bumpy complexions smooth to the softness of a rose. (Don't gloat... pregnancy has its share of inconveniences for everyone.) As your pregnancy progresses, your complexion may even out, though some women need to wait until after the baby is born before having nice skin again.  Later in pregnancy, some women develop a "mask" of dark pigment around their eyes, on their noses, and cheeks. This is called the chloasma and will slowly fade once you are a mom.   You may find yourself with a stuffy nose. Nasal congestion and nose bleeds are fairly common during pregnancy. Try using a vaporizer or humidifier to help lessen the symptoms. You continue to feel tired, nauseated, and possibly dizzy. Making a baby is hard work!

       I think I've had too many hits to my site today, so my picture site is locked up.  As an alternate, I've downloaded the pictures to Yahoo Photos.  I'll probably add them back via Ripway later, but for now, here's how to see my ultrasound photos.  Please click on My Photos on the right.  I'm having trouble zooming up on them though, so we may just have to be patient until Ripway unlocks.  Here are those links.   urlLink Picture 1  - This is the best view.  The plus sign is where the heart was beating.  The black dot on the right is the frontal lobe of the brain.  See picture 2 (identical) to see where the eyes are.  You can also make out arm and leg buds.  urlLink Picture 2  - This is the same as picture one, but the plus signs are where the eyes are.  The baby kind of has it's chin on it's chest which is why the head looks so large.  urlLink Picture 3  - This just shows the crown to rump measurements.  urlLink Picture 4  - Another measurement picture from the abdomen ultrasound.  You can see the edge of the amniotic sac below the baby.  urlLink Picture 5  - Very similar to picture 4.

       Sorry for my delay in posting, but this mama needed her nap!  We had our first ultrasound today and it was good.    I left work just before 11:00 to head to Eric's office to pick him up.  I got there at 11:15, 15 minutes before we'd planned to leave.  He got tied up doing some stuff and we didn't leave until 11:40 a.m.  I was getting a bit anxious because my paperwork said to be there 30 minutes early and my appointment was at 12:15 p.m.  Shouldn't have been too concerned though, because we had to wait anyway.  I, of course, had to pee, but was trying to hold off, so I could provide a "sample."  Finally, at 12:25 p.m., I asked if I could go ahead and do my sample, so I wouldn't have to wait.  When I came out of the bathroom, the nurse was waiting and told me they were ready.  I went back to the waiting room to get Eric and they took us back to an exam room.  It was a different room than last time.  The nurse told me that all we were doing was the ultrasound to make sure everything was ok, and that we'd wait on the bloodwork, my pelvic exam, etc, for when I came back to see Dr. D.  She said the Dr. A was one room away, and would be in shortly.  I got situated under the paper sheet and waited.  And waited.  And waited a little more.  Poor Eric was starting to get a little steamed.  I think he was more nervous than I was.  Finally, at 12:50 p.m. Dr. A came in.  Eric got up to shake his hand, I decided to stay on the table.  He introduced himself and said that we were just doing the ultrasound to make sure "the baby is alive and looks good." He then said that Dr. D really wanted to be there for my first appointment, so we'd save the rest for her later.  He said, that they just knew I was probably going crazy and didn't want me to have to wait on the ultrasound.  That was the first time I realized that they had made sure they still got me in this week because of my previous situation.  They could have just pushed my appointment back, but knew that I must have been holding my breath and didn't want to make it harder on me.  He asked me for my LMP (date of last menstural period).  I told him March 9th, but said that I think I ovulated closer to Day 17 or 18.  He asked if I'd been charting my BBT.  I told him this month we stopped temping, but that I still paid attention to my cervical fluid.  He said, "you get pretty good at that after I while."  I explained that day 17 was my last "fertile" day of fluid and that my breast tenderness started on cycle day 20, so I figured ovulation was somewhere in that range.  He didn't ask to see my charts or anything, but didn't seem to think I was a freak for knowing that either.  He started by trying the ultrasound on my belly.  He said that the picture wouldn't be as good, but he'd try this way first.  He did see the baby and said he was looking for a heartbeat, very quickly he found it.  It wasn't quite as obvious as I thought it would be, but when he pointed to the spot, you could see it flickering.  We couldn't see much though, so we decided to go ahead and do the tranvaginal ultrasound.  Again, he zeroed on the baby and showed us where the heart was beating.  He took some measurements and the baby measured at 7 weeks 5 days.  My estimate was 7 weeks 6 days, so I say close enough and it looks like it's right on track.  He showed us where he could see eye sockets (although, I never could really make it out) and I think we can distinguish possible arm and leg buds on a picture.  He zoomed in to make it bigger, but a little more blurry, and we could really see the heart flickering away.  It was a good feeling.  I looked at Eric and he had an ear to ear grin.  The doctor also said that once they see an established heart beat, that the chance of loss is reduced almost to zero.  I'm not sure I entirely believe that, but he's the doctor, so we'll go with that.  He printed us off 5 pictures which I will post, hopefully, later tonight.  He also printed off one for my doctor to leave in the file.  I'm sort of hoping, she'll want a better view and do another ultrasound next time, but we'll see.  After we were done, we had to stop and make another appointment.  The nurse I usually talk to, was very excited to hear that everything was good and I was right on schedule.  They are scheduling me for a "New OB" time slot, because we have to do everything else.  I asked if that meant we'd do another ultrasound.  The schedule lady didn't know, and then a nurse said that insurance doesn't usually pay for a second one.  I mentioned that my insurance will pay for anything, so we'll see if they take the bite and let me do another one.  I'm just getting greedy.  My new appoinment is May 27th, so I'll be almost 11 weeks by then.    When I came home today, I did a little research and found out that you can hear the baby heartbeat via doppler anywhere from 10 to 12 weeks.  I'm hopeful that 11 weeks, the baby will cooperate and I can get to hear the heartbeat if I don't get another ultrasound.  Oh, it was a good day.  Thank you everyone for your prayers.  Keep up the good work!

       Today was kind of a weird day at work.  They are doing a software upgrade to get us all on Windows XP, so they have to take each computer for 4-6 hours.  Today was my day.  My laptop was gone when I got in, so I did what I could work wise and then went to a client to discuss some things, so I didn't have acess to e-mail or the Internet all day long.  Anyway, I left the client at about 4:30 p.m. and called into my work voice-mail.  The first message was from my OB/GYN office.  Apparently, my doctor has some kind of family emergency and has to cancel her appointments all week.  This freaked me out a bit as I've been looking forward to this appointment for some reassurance.  As you may remember, Eric has two weeks of jury duty starting Monday and I really want him to be there for my first ultrasound.  So I called the office back.  They are able to have another doctor see me this week for a "quick" appointment to confirm the pregnancy and dates, and then they said they'd schedule me an appointment with my doctor next week for a more in depth appointment.  I asked if during this "quick" appointment we'd do an ultrasound, again because I want Eric to be there and I don't want to wait another two to three weeks.  An ultrasound will be included and my new appointment is Thursday at 12:15 p.m with Dr. "A.".  So now, I get to do this a whole day sooner.  When I got home, I looked at my list of doctors in the practice and Dr. "A's" first name is Joseph.  This will be my first male gynocologist.  Even though it's a quick appointment, the ultrasound is transvaginal, so it is a bit more personal than visits to my regular male doctor.  I've really got mixed feeling about my new appointment.  First of all, I'm excited that it will be sooner, but on the other hand I've had Friday so ingrained in my conciousness, that I'm a little afraid I won't be "prepared."  Not that I can do much to prepare.  I just think it's really hitting me.  When my appointment was a couple weeks away, I could look at it as a date in the future when I could be relieved.  Now that's it's only two days away, I'm just really scared that it's a date where all my dreams could come crashing down...again.  I'm really trying to have faith.  I keep remembering that things are very different this time.  I've got tons of "good" symptoms.  I was still nauseous this morning and before lunch.  I needed a nap when I got home from work today.  I think I'm also in a better place mentally/spiritually.  Not that I felt out of place last time, but this time, I'm just so much more focused on what kind of parent I want to be.  I'm thinking so much more about the baby instead of me.  I just need to repeat my prayer.  God is in control.  My worrying doesn't help anything.  No matter what happens, I will survive and grow stronger.  I'm just hopeful that God's will matches mine in this situation.  Two more days.

       I got an e-mail from an old friend this morning and it prompted me to check my e-mail linked to this web-site.  It was kind of exciting.  I had 4 e-mails relating to my blog.  One was from the friend.  One was from my Great Uncle and Aunt who reached my blog through my Mom’s website.  Two were from total strangers.  One was a woman who found my site through a post I had left on Fertility Friend right after I found out I was pregnant.  I tried to e-mail her, but it was returned.  The other was from a 15 year old girl.  I’m not sure how she found my site, but she thought it was very informative about what it was like to be pregnant.  I’m not sure if this girl is or isn’t pregnant now, but either way I hope I’m giving good information.  It’s kind of exciting to realize that other people than my friends and family read my site.  I know I can’t get enough of other people’s blogs so it’s cool to think that strangers may be following my life too.  That settles it, tonight I’m definitely adding the links of my favorite blogs that I read.  I’m thinking I’ll do a category for TTC or Infertility, a category for Currently Pregnant, and a category of new Moms.

       Time for the weekly update.  Important thing happening this week is my doctor's appointment complete with ultrasound.  At this point I think I'm more excited than nervous, but will definately relax once we know everything looks o.k.  Only five more days.   The Baby  By your 8th week of pregnancy, the crown-to-rump length of your baby is 0.56 to 0.8 inch (14 to 20 mm).  This is about the size of a pinto bean.  Your baby is continuing to grow and to change rapidly during these early weeks.  Eyelid folds are forming on the face.  The tip of the nose is present.  Ears are forming, internally and externally.  In the heart, the aortic and pulmonary valves are present and distinct.  Tubes leading from the throat to the functioning part of the lungs are branched, like the branches of a tree.  The body's trunk area is getting longer and straightening out.  Elbows are present, and the arms and leggs extend forward.  Arms have grown longer.  They bend at the elbows and curve slightly over the heart.  The digital rays, which become fingers, are notched.  Toe rays are present on the feet.  Your embryo is about 8mm long, and an ultrasound done now would detect the tiny thumping of the heart. Although all her major organs have formed, they are not fully developed or functional.  Your baby is constantly moving and shifting, although you won't be able to feel it for many more weeks. The arms now bend at the elbow and curve slightly; the hands are now flexed at the wrist and meet over the heart area. The legs are lengthening, and the feet may be long enough to meet in front of the body. It's still impossible to tell whether you're having a boy or a girl.  Your baby will be about 8-11 mm CR by the end of the week. The baby's hind brain is clearly visible. This week the baby's gonads will become either testes or ovaries. And spontaneous movement begins! There are a lot of things that we do know about life before birth.  Bones and joints this week have many things going on. Elbows appear and the process of ossification (hardening of the bones) begins. Toe rays become present, almost ready for you to count!    The Mom  Your uterus is getting bigger, but it probably still isn't big enough for you to be showing, especially if this is your first pregnancy.  You will notice a gradual change in your waistline and the fit of your clothes.  Your healthcare provider will see that your uterus is enlarged if you have a pelvic exam.  Before pregnancy, your uterus was about the size of your fist.  After 6 weeks of growth, it is about the size of a grapefruit.  As the uterus grows, you may feel cramping or even pain in your lower abdomen or your sides.  Some women feel tightening or contractions of the uterus.    Your waistline may begin growing this week, though you're probably not showing. If you press your abdomen, you may feel your enlarged uterus -- it's about the size of a softball.   Though you haven't gained much weight yet, parts of you are certainly growing — like your breasts. Less obvious is the increase in blood volume; by the end of pregnancy, you'll have 45 to 50 percent more blood running through your veins to meet the demands of your baby. Take your prenatal vitamins to make sure you're getting the extra iron you need.  You have probably scheduled the first office visit by now. Some practitioners do not want to see you for your first visit until after you've missed two periods. This will decrease the numbers of false pregnancies and miscarriages. Many things will take place at the first visit:  Urine Sampled (protein, hCG, etc.)  Blood Pressure (baseline)  Weight (baseline)  Pelvic Exam (size of uterus, cysts, coloring of cervix)  Pap Smear (some practitioners do this now, others wait)  Blood (Rh factor, iron levels, immunities, specifically rubella)  Family History (complications that may be predictable)   Every practitioner has a different schedule and each visit will not be as lengthy as this initial visit. This is a good time to ask any questions that have come up or to go over the list of questions for choosing a care provider.

       Internet's back up.  We think it may be a router problem.  We're getting RoadRunner (cable modem) on Saturday, so hopefully most of these Internet problems will disappear.  Anyway, here's the development update.   My Symptoms  Not much new.  I've been having more headaches.  I notice that I get them when I get hungry, so I try to eat more often, but sometimes I just get them.  Tylenol doesn't help much, but that's all I've got.  I do miss my Imitrex.  I'm still getting bigger.  Last week I started gaining weight.  It's ok though, because What to Expect says I can gain a pound a week.  I don't think I've felt the baby yet.  At least nothing I could be be remotely sure was the baby.  Hopefully, soon.  I'll give more of an update after Thursday's appointment.   The Baby  The crown-to-rump length of your baby by this week is 4.3 to 4.6 inches.  Weight is about 2.8 ounces. Fine lanugo hair covers your baby's head.  The umbilical cord is attached to the abdomen; this attachment has moved lower on teh body of the fetus.  Fingernails are well formed.  The legs are longer than the arms.  Arms and legs are moving.  You can see this movement during an ultrasound examination.  You may also be able to feel your baby move at this point in your pregnancy.  Many women describe feelings of movement as a "gas bubble" or "fluttering."  Often, it's something you have noticed for a few days or more, but you didn't realize what you were feeling.  Then it occurs to you:  You're feeling the baby moving inside you!  The fetus is about 5 1/2 inches long and weighs 3 ounces. It can swallow! It has preliminary toenails and can move its eyes (though there’s not a lot to see in there).   At 4 1/2 inches long (head to bottom) and 3 1/2 ounces, your baby is about the size of an avocado. In the next three weeks, she'll go through a tremendous growth spurt, though, doubling her weight and adding inches to her length. Her lower limbs are much more developed now. Her head is more erect than it has been, and her eyes have moved toward the front of her head. Your baby's ears are close to their final position, too. Some of her more advanced body systems are working, including her circulatory system and urinary tract. Her heart is now pumping about 25 quarts of blood each day. (By the end of your pregnancy, this will increase to about 1,900 quarts.) The patterning of her scalp has begun, though her hair isn't recognizable yet. Although closed, her eyes are moving (slowly), and she's even started growing toenails.   Your baby's nails are well formed, and some babies are even in need of having their nails trimmed at birth. The ears have also moved from the neck to the head.  Your baby is emptying his or her bladder every 40-45 minutes. The limb movements are becoming more coordinated. Your baby is about 3 ounces (85 grams) and 6.3 inches (16 cms). The gender may be detectable by ultrasound.    The Mom  As your baby grows, your uterus and placenta are also growing.  Six weeks ago, your uterus weighed about 5 ounces.  Today it weighs about 8.75 ounces.  The amount of amniotic fluid around the baby is also increasing.  There is now about 7.5 uonces of fluid.  You can easily feel your uterus about 3 inches below your bellybutton.  "By doze is stuffed ub!" Stuffy nose is common in pregnancy, and so are nosebleeds. That nose of yours is going through a lot right now (as is the rest of you). Progesterone and estrogen are coursing through your body at high rates, softening and swelling mucus membranes including those in the nose and in (hooray!!!) the cervix! Avoid nasal sprays and medications -- sometimes a humidifier in the room where you sleep can help.  Have people been telling you how wonderful you look? The "glow of pregnancy" is real, thanks to increased blood flow to the skin. You may be enjoying yourself more, too, now that your hormones have stabilized and nausea has eased up. You're also probably less anxious about something happening to your baby (the risk of miscarriage drops dramatically after the 14th week) which likely adds to your overall sense of well-being. Soon you'll experience one of the most wonderful moments of pregnancy — feeling your baby move. While some women notice "quickening" as early as 16 weeks, most don't until about 18 weeks or more. If this is your first baby, don't be too anxious — you may not be aware of your baby's movements until 20 weeks or so. The earliest movements may feel like little flutters, gas bubbles, or even like popcorn popping. Over the following weeks they'll start to feel unmistakably like kicks.  You may begin to feel the baby move around this point. This is more likely to happen now if you are a multipara (someone who has had a previous child) or if you are very thin. Generally you will feel the baby move about one month earlier than you did in a previous pregnancy, mainly because you know what you are feeling. It is not uncommon for first time mothers to not recognize fetal movements until 22-24 weeks. These first movements are called "quickening." They can also be used in helping to determine your due date.

       I’m taking a moment to do my weekend update.  It wasn’t a bad weekend, although, I think traveling while pregnant is not very fun.   Friday  I got a lot done at work. Yeah!  Then I decided to take a short nap when I got home.  Eric came in and decided to lay down with me at about 6:00 p.m.  I got up at about 7:00 p.m. and Eric just kept sleeping.  I took a nice bath and then the neighbors called.  They were playing Putt Putt, so I decided to go join them.  I tried to wake Eric up, but he was out.  I played a game of miniature golf and went to get ice cream with them.  I got home around 10:00 p.m. and had a brief conversation with my Father-In-Law.  Eric was still out, so I went next door to hang out a little more and watch some TV.  I came home and went to bed around midnight.  Eric was still asleep.   Saturday  I woke Eric up at 8:00 a.m. to go into the office (14 hours of sleep!)  I slept a little later, and got up around 9:30 a.m.  I puttered around, not expecting Eric until around noon.  He got home around 10:30 a.m. and I had to get our stuff together.  We ended up leaving around 11:00 a.m., but had to stop at Wal-Mart to pick up Logan’s birthday gift and then get some lunch.  By 12:00 we were on the road.  We got into Gary & Christie’s around 4:00 p.m. (3 Indiana time).  We had a really nice afternoon.  The weather was great and we sat outside on their patio enjoying the company and the new water feature in the backyard.  Eric’s uncle Leonard and aunt Vicki stopped by and Gary grilled us some ribs that were so yummy.  When it started to get dark, Gary built a fire and we turned on the TV outside and watched a movie.  It was like a drive in.  I also used the Doppler and let them here a live show of the Little One.  One other really cool thing is that they have offered to help us pay for our crib.  It’s so awesome.  I’d really been debating on getting what I really wanted or something cheaper online.  Now that it won’t be quite so much for us out of pocket, I think we’ll really get what we want.  It’s an investment because this crib will eventually become a full size bed and be used until the Little One goes to college.   Sunday  We got up and had some homemade biscuits and gravy for breakfast.  After breakfast, Eric and I decided to head on down to Bloomington to Kyle & Leslie’s.  The party for Logan really got under way at about 1:00 p.m. Indiana time.  We ate and stayed for presents and cake, and then left at around 4:00 p.m. (Ohio time).  We got home around 7:30 p.m. and I felt like I’d been hit with a truck.  I was so achy and sore.  I also got a headache Sunday morning that didn’t go away until about 10:00 a.m. today.  I took a bath when I got home and just layed on the couch for the rest of the evening.  On an unrelated note.  My Internet is down at home.  I’m not sure why.  I called today to order Road Runner, so we should have cable internet as soon as Saturday.  It’s painful that I won’t be able to update from home, but we’ll survive.  I’ll work on my weekly update for tomorrow hopefully.  Also, I’ve been doing some research on 3D ultrasound places.  I found one in Cincinnati that looks cool (and affordable), now I’m not sure if I want my doctor to agree to do it or not.  If Dr. D says no on Thursday, I’ll make an appointment at this  urlLink place .  I’m going to aim for the weekend of July 17th if we schedule our own.

       Last post for the day, I promise.  I uploaded the a new heartbeat file.  This one has the movement sounds.  It's about 14 seconds in.  If you listen to the whole thing, you'll hear it.  Remember, I wasn't moving the probe.   urlLink Here you go.

       I have a doctor appointment a week from tomorrow.  My doctor doesn't seem to volunteer information just because, so I want to come up with some questions for her.  I'll write what I have and PLEASE feel free to comment with more I should consider.  First a run down of what I expect to happen.  Arrive and wait in the waiting room 20 minutes past my appointment time.  Pee in a cup.  Get weighed and blood pressure taken.  Head into the exam room to wait another 15 minutes.  When the doctor comes in, I think she'll use her Doppler to listen for the heartbeat.  Then questions.  1.  What is the heartrate?  I know I could count this out myself, but I seem to have trouble counting over 30 in under 15 seconds. 2.  Exercise.  I've been getting somewhat of a desire to go back to the gym.  I know you can continue exercising when pregnant, but I need to know what is acceptable to begin again after stopping for 4 months.  More specifically, any restrictions on weight lifting. 3.  What does the doctor think my chances are of feeling the baby before my next appointment? (I know this isn't that important, but I'm curious) 4.  Next Ultrasound.  Will she perform an ultrasound at 20 weeks?  If not, any good reasons?  Can I change her mind?  What if I agree to pay if insurance doesn't?  If still no, does she know where I can go to get one done?  I plan to try to point out the other reasons than determining sex to do a 20 week ultrasound, including placement of the placenta, measuring for dates, narrowing down due date.   That's all I've got.  Any other suggestions?

       I feel like I’ve been neglecting my blog lately.  I know I’ve been doing my weekly updates, but I don’t really feel I’ve been saying much about me.  To make excuses, I’ve been super busy at work with no sign of things letting up.  My brain works best during the 9 to 5 hours, so I don’t have a whole lot left to give when I get home.  Today, I’m eating lunch at my desk, and while I’m eating, I’m typing.  I don’t want my pregnancy to slip away without capturing my feelings at every stage.  I think I’m in the honeymoon stage.  I currently love being pregnant.  Most of the negative side effects are gone (queasiness, extreme fatigue, constipation,) and I’m still far enough from the end to not be worried yet, about delivery or what to do when the baby comes home. Although, I did feel a twinge of heartburn two days ago.  I still get tired, but definitely have more energy.  Monday night I stayed up until 12:30 a.m. to finish reading a book (titled “Good in Bed” and recommended by my girlfriends).  A side note on that, no one warned me that there would be a subject involved that is very close to my heart and then when I broke into tears with several chapters to go and already  45 minutes past my bed time, that I would have to stay up until I finished it!   I also am very happy with what’s going on with my body.  I am beginning to feel incredibly sexy.  I know that sounds bizarre as I’m getting bigger, but it’s so different than “gaining weight”.  My chest is bigger and my belly is growing, but it is just taking on this wonderful round, full shape.  It’s not exactly hard, but the shape doesn’t remind me of what I look like when I put on weight.  I also think if it weren’t for the belly, it’s possible I would be losing weight right now.  My legs are getting thinner and therefore I feel like my lower body looks awesome.  I also am completely comfortable in all of my clothes with no waistbands digging into my skin or love handles overflowing, so I don’t feel “fat”.  I just look down and see the roundness of my stomach, but I don’t forget why it’s there.  I’m sure in months to come, I’ll start to feel differently as the inevitable weight gain occurs and possibly redistributes to not-so-welcome places, but for now, I’m happy.  I’m also thinking a lot about the baby.  It’s so hard for me to believe how big it must be inside me.  It’s probably in the 4 inch category right now.  Get out your ruler and look at how long that is…go ahead, I’ll wait.  I guess it’s hard for me to picture, when I still can’t feel it.  I think about that a lot too.  At night, before I go to bed, I listen to the baby.  It’s very active at night, I can here the bubble noises through the Doppler.  Maybe I’ll download them for you.  When I hear it move, I try very hard to feel it, but still nothing.  I’ve done some research and figure at the very early end, I could feel it by 18 weeks.  I hope so.  I can’t wait to be reminded that’s it’s there, just waiting and growing.  I’m also looking forward to possibly finding out the sex next month.  Although, I also think I’d be ok not knowing.  I just feel bad writing “it.”  Honestly, I usually refer to it as “he,”  I don’t want to give the baby a complex if it turns out to be a girl though, so I feel I should find out what it is.    Ok, work calls.  If I get a chance, I’d like to post again on questions for the doctor next week.  Feel free to leave any in the comment area if you can think of anything.  I’ll try to write again soon.

       It seemed to me like I'd been growing lately and I hadn't measured in about 3 weeks, so this morning I took measurements at 14 weeks, 1 day.  This time I'm going to compare to the beginning and last measurement at 11 weeks, 3 days.  Before = (B) Last = (L) Current =(C)  Weight - 150.5 (B), 150.5 (L), 151.0 (C) = +.5 pound (scale battery is dead, so weight is from a couple of days ago) Bicep - 11 3/4 (B), 11 3/4 (L), 11 3/4 (C) = No change Chest - 35 1/2 (B), 37 1/4 (L), 38 1/4 (C) = +2 3/4 inches Waist (at smallest point) - 30 (B), 31 (L), 31 1/2 (C) = +1 1/2 inches Waist (at belly button) - 32 1/2 (B), 34 1/2 (L), 36 (C) = +3 1/2 inches Hips - 38 (B), 38 (L), 38 1/2 (C) = + 1/2 Thigh - 23 (B), 22 1/2 (L), 22 1/4 (C) = - 3/4 inch Calf - 14 (B), 14 (L), 14 (C) = No change   Now the numbers are starting to get bigger.  Thankfully, still mostly in places I don't mind.  I'm curious to see what my doctor will say about my minimal weight gain next week.  I'm eating, so I'm assuming everything is going fine.

        My Symptoms  Not much has changed this week, except maybe the size of my abdomen.  I took some measurements, I'll post them in a separate post.  I still feel pretty good.  I don't know if I've really got my energy back, but I don't seem quite as useless.  I'm also really hungry.  I've decided my craving is for french fries.  Especially if they have cheese on them.  I'm crazy about Steak and Shake lately too.  I'm still looking forward to movement, but satisfy myself by listening.  It's so easy to find the heartbeat now.  I'm curious to see what the doctor will say about it next week.   The Baby  Crown-to-rump length by this week of pregnancy is 4.1 to 4.5 inches.  The fetus weighs about 1.75 ounces.  It's close to the size of a softball.  Your baby's rapid growth continues.  Its skin is thin.  At this point in its development, you can see blood vessels through the skin.  Fine hair called lanugo hair covers the baby's body.  By this time, your baby may be sucking its thumb.  Eyes continue to move to the front of the face but are still widely separated.  Ears continue to develop externally.  Lanugo, a very fine hair, covers the fetus. It will keep growing until around the 26th gestational week of pregnancy (that’s week 28 of your pregnancy to you, sister!).   At around 4 inches long, crown to rump, your baby now weighs about 2 1/2 ounces. He's busy inhaling and exhaling amniotic fluid, which will help develop the air sacs in his lungs. His legs are growing longer than his arms now, and he can move all his joints and limbs. That means his hands are more functional, too. Sweat glands are appearing, and although his eyelids are fused shut, he can sense light. If you shine a flashlight at your tummy, he's likely to move away from the beam. There's not much for your baby to taste at this point, but he now has taste buds. And if you have an ultrasound, you may be able to find out whether your baby's a boy or girl! (Don't be disappointed if it remains a mystery, though. Nailing down the gender depends somewhat on how clear the picture is and the position of your baby during the ultrasound.  Your baby may have developed the habit of sucking his or her thumb! The skin is very thin and you can see the blood vessels clearly underneath.  Your baby is about 70 grams. The scalp hair pattern is developing. And the heart is pumping about 25 quarts of blood a day. This will increase to about 300 at term.   The Mom  You can easily tell you're pregnant by the changes in your lower abdomen, which alter the way your clothes fit.  You may be able to feel your uterus about 3 or 4 inches below your bellybutton.  Your pregnancy may not be obvious to other people when you wear regular street clothes.  But it may become obvious if you start wearing maternity clothes or put on a swimming suit.  It's still a little early to feel movement, although you shoudl feel your baby move in the next few weeks!  The belt is getting tighter, your partner’s big clothes may fit in the waist, but what about those hips and that belly? Some women make it most of the way through with stretch pants and big shirts, but others need a more "professional" maternity wardrobe. Don’t worry, the days are gone when pregnancy meant fashion went out the window. Today’s styles are almost as cute as your baby is going to be.  Your uterus is halfway between pubic bone and belly button. You may feel Braxton Hicks contractions. These painless and random contractions can be thought of as your body warming up for the big event of birth. If you have more than five per hour, if they come at a steady pace, or if they’re accompanied by intense cramps or backaches, call the doctor.  Let’s talk about constipation. Or not. But it’s a fact of life for many pregnant women. Pump those fluids (at least 8 glasses of water a day) and keep doing mild exercise -- walking and swimming are terrific ways to get or stay in shape! If constipation becomes chronic, ask your healthcare provider to recommend an all-natural laxative.  You've probably gained about 5 pounds by now. If it's a little more or less, don't worry too much. Every woman gains weight at a different rate. While you're well into the swing of being pregnant, you may still be surprised by an unexpected symptom now and then. If your nose is stuffed up, for example, you can probably chalk it up to your pregnancy. That's because increased estrogen can cause swelling in the mucous membranes and possibly the production of more mucus. Your blood volume is increasing, too, which causes your blood vessels to expand, including those in your nose. (You may get occasional nosebleeds as a result.) And because pregnancy alters your immune system and makes you more susceptible to certain infections, it might just be that you have a cold or allergies. In any case, make sure you stay away from irritants, like cigarette smoke, aerosols, and alcohol. Don't worry if you and your partner are feeling a little stressed out these days. Many pregnant couples worry about the baby's health and how they'll cope as new parents. But with minimal physical discomfort and renewed energy, this is also a wonderful trimester for most women, so try to enjoy it!  Your heart is increasing its output to supply the baby with oxygen. Your enlarged heart is pumping about 20% more blood than prepregnancy. This volume will actually increase throughout your pregnancy for an ending increased heart output of 30-50%.  If your clothes are getting tight, do not try to cram yourself into clothes. Either invest in some maternity clothes, borrow them, wear your partner's clothing or unzip your pants!  The maternal blood screening for neural tube defects, often called the Alpha-fetoprotein Test (AFP) may be offered at this point. It is a screening that is most accurate during the 15 - 17th weeks of gestation, although this screening has a high false positive rate.

       In an e-mail to my girls today, I mentioned that the outfit I wore to work, hid nothing about my new shape.  I am posting a picture below.  The shirt is form fitting, so shows exactly where my belly is without hiding it in lots of extra fabric.  It's so bizarre, that I now chose to wear things that make me look "fat", where I used to complete avoid any outfit that would accentuate my waistline.  I can still cling to the fact that I've gained very little weight 1/2 pound to be exact.  At least by the time I have gained 10 or 15 pounds, my belly should be very round and pregnant like.    I have also included a  urlLink link  to the close up belly shot.  I'll add this one to the sidebar.  Ok, it's starting to seem like I'm obsessed with my growth.  I guess this is it until the kicking starts.

        Second Trimester!   Can you believe it?  Sometimes I still can't.  Anyway, it's official.  I am now in my second trimester, fourth month, and fourteenth week.  It's so good.   Here's the scoop.   My Symptoms  I feel great.  Like I mentioned earlier this week, I'm still tired, but all the other bad stuff I complained about a month ago.  I hardly remember.  Funny how that works.  Looking back, it wasn't so bad and didn't really last that long.  I'm guessing this is how I'll feel about the pain of childbirth a couple of weeks after I bring my baby home?   The Baby  The crown-to-rump length is 3.2 to 4.1 inches.  Your baby is about the size of your fist and weighs almost 1 ounce.  This week the baby's ears have moved from the neck to the sides of the head.  Eyes have been moving gradually to the front of the face from the side of the head.  The neck continues to get longer, and the chin no longer rests on the chest.  Sexual development continues.  It is becoming easier to determine male from female by looking at external genitalia, which are more developed.  Lub-dub, lub-dub..." At your doctor’s visit, ask to hear the baby’s heartbeat. At this point, using a Doppler you'll be able to hear the tiny beating.   Head to bottom, your baby's 3 1/2 inches long — about the length of a lemon — and weighs about 1 1/2 ounces. Her body's growing faster than her head, which now sits upon a more well-defined neck. By the end of this week, her arms will have lengthened and will be in proportion to the rest of her body. (Her legs still have some growing to do, though.) She's starting to develop an ultra-fine, downy covering of hair all over her body (called lanugo). Her liver starts secreting bile this week, a sign that it's already functioning properly, and her spleen starts contributing to the production of red blood cells. She's also producing and discharging urine into the amniotic fluid, a normal process that she'll keep up until birth. You still can't feel your baby's movements, but her hands and feet (which are now half an inch long) are more flexible and active. Thanks to brain impulses, her little facial muscles are getting a workout as she squints, frowns, and grimaces. She can grasp now, too, and she may be able to suck her thumb.   The baby is now about 12.5 cms or 4.92 inches. Your baby is now producing urine and actually urinating into the amniotic fluid. It also can practice "breathing" the amniotic fluid in and out of its lungs.  Amniotic fluid is an amazing substance. It completely regenerates itself every three hours. We do know that it is partially composed of urine from the baby, but where amniotic fluid in general is made we are not sure. Modern medicine still has some surprises left.    The Mom  Maternity clothes may be a "must" by now.  Some women try to get by for a while by not buttoning or zipping thier pants all the way or by using rubber bands or safety pins to increase their waistbands.  It usually only works for a short time.  YOU are going to get even bigger.  You'll enjoy your pregnancy more and feel more comfortable with cloting that fits comfortably and provides you room to grow.  It may feel like butterflies or it may feel like gas. Some mothers may feel fetal movement (quickening), though others may not be able to identify movement until around week 20. Soon, though, you’ll be playing footsie with a fetus who insists on poking you in the ribs and dancing the rumba -- just when you settle in for a good night’s rest.  And speaking of sleep -- not all pregnant women can! How can you get comfortable? Try warm milk, soothing massage and, as you grow, lots of pillows -- under your leg, under your belly, next to your back... did I also tell you you’ll need a bigger bed? (Hey, once the baby is born, you may never sleep again!)   As early discomforts (nausea, fatigue, breast tenderness) begin to fade, you may start to regain some energy and feel more comfortable with how your body's changing. (Although the top of your uterus is only a bit above your pelvic bone, that growth may be enough to push your tummy out a bit. Starting to show is an exciting pregnancy milestone and it will likely give you and your partner the visible evidence of a baby that you've been waiting for. Take some time to plan, daydream, and enjoy this amazing time. It's normal to worry a bit now and then, but you can also breathe a little sigh of relief knowing that with the start of this trimester your risk of miscarriage has dropped significantly. Now try to focus on taking care of yourself and your baby and having faith that you're well equipped for what's ahead.  The hormonal changes in your body are becoming apparent. Many are in the form of skin changes. You may have developed a dark line down the middle of your abdomen to your pubic bone called a linea negra. The areola (dark nipple portion of your breasts) may have darkened and gotten larger as well. Your uterus is now the size of a grapefruit.

       I haven’t updated in a while, so before I jump into my overwhelming workload today, I thought I’d do a quick entry.  I’m tired again.  I thought I was getting past that, but this week has wiped me out.  I think a big part of it has to do with my current work situation.  Since they eliminated the position of the woman who worked most closely with me (with the exception of my boss), I’ve had to pick up a lot of her workload.  She had one client that I didn’t work on, that seems to consume enormous amounts of time, plus the boss was out while I was trying to piece things together and I have to help the new admin person on the account piece things together too.  This has resulted in people coming to me with questions on this account that I don’t readily have the answers to, so I have to dig through piles of information and e-mail people I’ve never worked with and try to find the answers.  My boss came back yesterday and despite all the questions that arose over the past 4 work days, we didn’t have much left to ask him.  I’d already figured most of it out.  Anyway, those issues or the combination of the growth spurt the baby must be having has made me long for my bed by 9:30 p.m.  I’ve been giving in a lot too.  Another piece of good news, I think I’ve adjusted to maternity wear.  This morning I considered some non-maternity pants that could still work.  I put them on and had to suck in to button.  While, they did button, I decided against them.  I’m now used to the freedom of the elastic waistband and not getting that pesky outline of the inside button on your stomach by the end of the day.  People’s comments have all been positive too.  Unless they are talking about me behind my backs, no one seems to think I look ridiculous.  If anything, more people have noticed that I’m “showing.”  Now don’t get me wrong, maternity clothes are designed to accentuate that your stomach is no longer flat, and I look more pregnant in clothes than out of them at this point.  BUT…I also look pregnant in my sweats and T-shirt, so this is definitely for real.  I love it.  It has become a bit more difficult to get comfortable on the couch or in bed though.  I’m sure it will get much worse, but the point is that now I am noticing changes.  Last topic, the heartbeat.  I still love the sound.  I still listen daily, but I think it’s safe to say that when I pull out the Doppler, I’m not listening for reassurance or because I’m scared or worried.  Right now, it’s all about love.  It has gotten easier to find the heartbeat this week.  When I do find it, it’s such a strong distinct sound.  The coolest part is that if I find it, I’ll hold the probe completely still and just listen.  I’ll hear it for a while, and then usually it will fade a bit or I’ll hear a bubbly kind of sound (think VH-1’s Pop-Up Video).  Then sometimes the heartbeat will completely fade.  The baby moves.  Then I have to move the probe to find it again.  I love the thought that this tiny baby is moving and kicking and growing in there.  Just a few more weeks and I’ll be able to feel those movements.  I really can’t wait to feel those kicks.  Ahh, I must be glowing.

        My Symptoms  I feel good this week.  The main change going on with me is the expanding waistline.  I feel weird about it.  I'm excited don't get me wrong, but it is still weird when someone mentions it to me.  I wore maternity clothes a little at work too last week.  Mostly the pants, no shirts that were obvious.  When I wore the clothes to the movies I almost felt like an imposter.  It's obvious to me and those around me that my body is changing, but there still isn't that tell-tale bulge that can't be mistaken for anything but a baby.  I guess I need to accept it, I am pregnant, and these clothes are now more comfortable.  People won't judge and think I'm switching too early.  This will be irrelevant in a couple of weeks anyway.  Soon, it will be obvious to everyone.  The other weird thing about growing is that I can tell I'm bigger.  I don't really know how to explain this.  I guess when I imagined being pregnant, I imagined I'd feel like me, but just have a belly (Think-Maternity store mirror with the belly pillow strapped on).  Now that's it's growing, it's like I am too.  That belly that's getting there is also a part of me.  When I sit, I just feel this extra part of me on my stomach.  I'm used to where my belly button is supposed to be and how it feels to be standing around in jeans.  I keep finding myself trying to hold in my stomach.  I'm not sure if I did it before or if I'm just trying to feel "normal."  It's really hard to just let loose and let it all hang out.  I guess I've been so programmed to wanting to feel thin and have a flat stomach that subconciously I'm still fighting it.  It surprises me, because I've at the same time, been excitedly looking forward to the day I'd wake up round.  I guess I just didn't imagine that I'd feel round as well as looking it.  It's not like strapping on the belly pillow in the maternity store.  This belly belongs to me.  Ok, here's what happens this week of development.   The Baby  Your baby is growing rapidly!  It's crown-to-rump length is 2.6 to 3.1 inches, and it weight between .5 and .7 ounce.  It is about the size of a peach.  Fetal grown is particulary striking now through about 24 weeks of pregnancy.  One interesting change is the relative slowdown in the growth of the baby's head compared to the rest of his body.  In week 13, the head is about half the crown-to-rump length.  By week 21, the head is about one-fourth the size of it's body.  Your baby's face is beginning to look more humanlike.  Eyes, which started out on the side of the head, move closer together on the face.  The ears come to lie in their normal position on the side of the head.  Eternal genitalia have developed enough so that a male can be distinguished from a female if examined outside the womb.    Your belly may soon be big enough to announce to the world that you're expecting, but your baby is still tiny. In fact, he's only about 3 inches long crown to rump — roughly the size of a jumbo shrimp — and weighs just about an ounce. Despite the small proportions, there's a fully formed baby inside your womb now. Much more proportional than it was a few weeks ago, his head is now only about a third the size of his body. His tiny, unique fingerprints are already in place. His kidneys and urinary tract are functional, and he's starting to urinate out the amniotic fluid he's been swallowing. As you start your second trimester, most of your baby's critical development will be completed, and your odds of miscarriage will drop considerably.  There are a lot of things going on this week! All twenty teeth have formed and are waiting (Teething is yet to come!). Your baby approximately weighs in at 1 ounce (28.3 grams). Consider that the placenta weighs about an ounce now as well.  Your baby's intestines are migrating from the umbilical cord into his or her abdomen. The villi are also forming in the intestines, these help in peristaltic movements and digestion. The pancreas of your little one is even secreting insulin!    The Mom  Your uterus has grown quite a bit.  You can probably feel its upper edge above the pubic bone in the lowest part of your abdomen, about 4 inches below your bellybutton.  At 12 to 13 weeks, your uterus fills your pelvis and starts growing upward into your abdomen.  It feels like a soft, smooth ball.  You have probably gaines some weight by now.  If morning sickness has been a problem and you've had a hard time eating, you may not have gained much weight.  As you feel better and as your baby rapidly starts to gain weight, you'll gain weight.  You are losing your waist!  Clothing fits snugly.  It's time to start wearing loose-fitting clothing.  The Second Trimester!  Hooray! Your morning sickness should be starting to subside, and miscarriage is less of a risk. The second trimester brings in relief and reality...  Yes, you're really having a baby!  Now that the high-risk period is over, you probably have some pregnancy announcements to make. That is, if you've been able to keep the big news a secret.   Time to celebrate! This is the last week of your first trimester. Next week you'll be in your second trimester. That's great news for two reasons: One, your risk of miscarriage drops dramatically, and two, many women see early pregnancy symptoms, such as morning sickness, subside. (In some cases, though, heartburn replaces the nausea.) Birth is still months away, but your breasts may have already started making colostrum, the nutrient-rich fluid that feeds your baby for the first few days after birth, before your milk starts to flow. Many couples also notice a distinct libido lift in the second trimester as nausea abates and energy returns.  Welcome to the second trimester! This is usually the time when mothers feel their best. They are "over" the joys of early pregnancy and have more energy. They are also beginning to feel pregnant.  Some people have delayed spreading the good news until this point. If you are one of these people enjoy telling now, and think of some creative ways to do it. This is also a time when fathers and other family members start becoming more involved as the pregnancy becomes more real for them. Encourage them to participate in your pregnancy to the extent that you feel comfortable with.   Your appointments will now consist of: Blood Pressure  Weight  Fundal Height (Growth of the Uterus)  Baby's Heart Tones  Urine

       It seems like it's been a while since I wrote about other things going on in my life.  I guess I'll make this a kind of weekend update, but also pick up some highlights from last week.  Last weekend we spent the weekend in Indiana visiting family.  Eric worked a little on Saturday, so we didn't get to leave until almost 11 a.m.  We went to Eric's brothers for the day and had a cookout.  Eric's Mom and friend came down too, so we got to spend some time with them.  We spent the night Saturday night.  Sunday morning we drove up to my Grandparents house for another cookout.  My parents came over from Iowa and we got to spend Sunday with my family.  There ended up being about 13 people and 4 dogs there at one point.  We spent the night Sunday and then drove home Monday morning.  Tuesday, was back to work and I got a lot done.  We had to tie up some loose ends as my boss was going to be out for a week as his wife was being induced and the baby coming on Wednesday.  Wednesday was also business as usual, and Pete never called with baby news.  Thursday morning we finally got a call that the baby was born just after midnight.  They had a boy.  I had to leave work around 11 a.m. as I had volunteered to work at our Corporate hospitality tent at The Memorial Tournament (professional golf).  Right before I left, my friend Kristin, told me that a woman in my office had been laid off and she had heard there were more to come.  We joked about whether we'd see each other the next day.  Right after I made it to the tournament, I got a call on my cell phone from another woman in the office asking if Kristin was with me.  Apparently 8 people had been let go and no one could find Kristin.  I called her cell phone and confirmed the news.  She was one of the eight.  Fortunately I was not, but it's still a bit of a morale deflater that some more people are gone. On a lighter note, Thursday night, Eric and I went to the movies with our neighbors and saw Troy.  It was better than I expected, so I was overall pleased.  I also officially wore maternity clothes that look like maternity clothes for the first time in public.     Don't I look cute?  Friday was weird at work.  I spent a good portion of the time trying to figure out how to help clients that were now without a service team. One client has my boss, Kristin, and a CE who was also released, none of them are around now.  I had scheduled summer hours though, so I went ahead and left at noon and got my hair done.  Saturday, Eric and I went shopping.  First we took my car by the body shop to have them order parts, so we can get started on repairs soon.  We also stopped at Best Buy for some software to help us out with our Spyware/Adware problem.  The initial scan showed 152 threats on our computer.  Eric got a new pair of tennis shoes.  And we shopped for baby furninture.  It's harder than I expected.  The store we picked furniture out in last time has went out of business.  We found a crib we liked at Baby Depot in Burlington Coat Factory for $299, but there wasn't any matching furniture like a dresser or changing table.  Babies R Us didn't lead me to anything I loved.  We also went to a non-chain type store called My Own Room.  We found a crib and dresser there that I love (we'd still have to get a stand alone changing table), but the pieces were $559 each.  Don't get me wrong, it's quality furninture, plus the bed is convertible to a toddler and full size bed.  The dresser would last forever too.  I just don't know if I'm ready to spend quite that much on infant furniture.  When I got home (after my nap of course), I did some online shopping.  I found a crib/dresser/and changer that I like on a website for about $810 total.  I just am not sure if stuff is as nice as it looks online and if I trust spending that much money on a site that I've never heard of before I started searching.  The last option is E-bay.  It sounds a little crazy, but a message board that I read mentioned the seller's name and said good things about it.  I checked out the options and can get the exact same crib/dresser/changer I found at the online store for $775 including shipping.  I just don't know what to do.  At least I'm researching, but it would be easier if the stuff that's cheaper was at a store here in town and I could just order in person.  At about 10:30 p.m. Eric and I went to the neighbors to play Euchre.  We were up until almost 1 a.m.    Sunday (today) been kind of lazy.  We did go to church this morning and then to lunch with Martin and April.  I just got up from a nap and thought I'd update.  There a huge pile of laundry in the bedroom calling me and I've got to get to the grocery store.  I have actually ran out of bottled water!  Ok, I'm going to write another post about the baby update now.

       Finally as promised.  The link to my  urlLink belly picture  at 11 weeks 3 days.  Personally, I don't think it looks much different from the 8 week picture except that it seems like I'm wider all over rather than just at the belly area.  Trust me, the clothes fit differently and there is a difference.  Also, here are my stats compared to the beginning.  Again, not much change, but I think I'm getting wider in places not being measured, like under my belly button, but not quite the hips.  Anyway, at least I have a record.  Before = (B) Current =(C)  Weight - 150.5 (B), 150.5 (C) = -.5 pound Bicep - 11 3/4 (B), 11 3/4 (C) = No change Chest - 35 1/2 (B), 37 1/4 (C) = +1 3/4 inches Waist (at smallest point) - 30 (B), 31 (C) = +1 inches Waist (at belly button) - 32 1/2 (B), 34 1/2 (C) = +2 inches Hips - 38 (B), 38 (C) = No change Thigh - 23 (B), 22 1/2 (C) = - 1/2 inch Calf - 14 (B), 14 (C) = No change

       We had the big appointment today.&nbsp; I have to be honest up front and say that I was a little disappointed.&nbsp; I think I was expecting clearer pictures and that we'd be able to see a whole lot now that the baby's bigger.&nbsp; They weren't and we couldn't.&nbsp; Now Eric says he could see what the doctor was pointing out, but I couldn't.&nbsp; I felt like Rachel on Friends.&nbsp; I actually cried when we got to the car because I couldn't tell what anything was.  Here's what we did see.&nbsp; The baby has hands, feet, fingers, and toes.&nbsp; We saw the head, heart with 4 chambers beating away, spinal cord, and legs.&nbsp; At one point we followed the legs down and saw them moving and I felt movement.&nbsp; I guess that really confirms it, I saw the baby kick while I felt it.&nbsp; These movements are baby related.&nbsp; It weighs 10 ounces right now.  Hmmm...what else?&nbsp; Oh yeah, it's a girl!&nbsp; Again, I couldn't see anything, but the doctor was pretty sure she was seeing girl parts.&nbsp; We asked her how sure and she said 85%.&nbsp; I'll take that.&nbsp; I think I was hoping for a boy, but I wanted at least one of each anyway, so a girl is just fine.&nbsp; I'm guessing she'll have her Dad wrapped around her little finger in no time.&nbsp; Her name will be Grace Ellen Marie.&nbsp; I love that name.&nbsp; So now just 20 more weeks until little Grace can come out to play.

        My Symptoms  I feel big.&nbsp; I think I've gained a pretty good amount of weight this week.&nbsp; I'm waiting a couple more days to do pics and measurements in case it's just left over from my weekend, but I don't think I have to worry about not gaining enough during this stage.&nbsp; I'm also officially feeling movement.&nbsp; I'm still pretty sure I felt it a couple of times over the past two or three weeks, but some of it was probably gas or hunger.&nbsp; If you read my weekend post, you'll know that I'm sure I felt it on Saturday.&nbsp; Today was even more confirmation.&nbsp; I think since I sit alot at work, I'm more apt to notice it.&nbsp; I was a little slow in going to lunch, but I was sitting at my desk trying to get a few more things done.&nbsp; I had my chair pushed in and my belly was touching the desk.&nbsp; I felt two distinct thumps from inside.&nbsp; I know that wasn't my stomach growling.&nbsp; Then the rest of the afternoon, I kept feeling little nudges.&nbsp; Not so much tonight, but I'm sure it'll just get stronger the next couple of days and weeks.&nbsp; I've also been getting heartburn more.&nbsp; Nothing too serious, but it helps to remain upright after a meal.&nbsp; Laying on the couch after dinner is bad.&nbsp; Last thing... only three more days until the ultrasound!&nbsp; I'm really excited.&nbsp; I'll post on Thursday, but will probably call most people first.&nbsp; I need to get my call list together.&nbsp; Here's what all the books and websites say is going on this week.&nbsp; By the way, I'm still a definate innie.   The Baby  At this point in development, the crown-to-rump length is 5.6 to 6.4 inches.&nbsp; Your baby weighs about 9 ounces.  Your bun in the oven is "half-baked!" All the pieces are there and, if it’s a girl, she’s growing her vagina this week!  Your baby weighs about 10 1/2 ounces now. He's also around 6 1/2 inches long from head to bottom, and about 10 inches from head to heel. (For the first 20 weeks, we use measurements taken from the top of the baby's head to her bottom — known as the "crown to rump" measurement. After that, we use measurements from head to toe. (This is because a baby's legs are curled up against her torso during the first half of pregnancy and are very hard to measure.)A greasy white substance called vernix caseosa coats her entire body to protect her skin during its long submersion in amniotic fluid. (This slick coating also eases the journey down the birth canal.)Your baby is swallowing more, which is good practice for her digestive system. She's also producing meconium, a black, sticky substance that's the result of cell loss, digestive secretion, and swallowed amniotic fluid. This meconium will accumulate in her bowels, and you'll see it in her first messy diaper (although a few babies pass it in utero or during delivery).   Lanugo forms from sebum and skin cells to create vernix. This creamy white substance is believed to help protect the baby inutero. It will cling to the lanugo and in the creases. This is also something that can be seen sometimes after the birth. Rumor has it that nursery nurses use it for hand lotion, because of its smooth, protect quality.&nbsp; You may be aware of sleep wake cycles in your little one. The weight is now up to 10 ounces (283 grams) and the baby measures about 25 cms total length, about 9.8 inches.    The Mom  Congratulations - 20 weeks marks the midpoint, and you're halfway through your pregnancy!&nbsp; Your uterus is probably about even with your bellybutton.&nbsp; Your healthcare provider has been watching your growth and the enlargement of your uterus.&nbsp; Growth to this point may have been irregular, but usually becomes more regular after the 20th week.  Some women experience temporary  urlLink vision changes  during pregnancy. If you wear contact lenses, they may become uncomfortable for you because of the increased fluid in your eyes. Don’t buy an expensive pair of glasses now -- your vision will revert to its normal condition once baby is here.&nbsp; Your belly button may become an "outie" as the uterus presses on it from behind. Some women swear that putting a Band-Aid on it helps keep it from brushing painfully against their clothes. Worth a try!  You've made it to the halfway mark — Congratulations! The top of your uterus is at the level of your belly button now, and you've likely gained about 10 pounds. Expect to gain an average of about another pound each week from now on. (If you started your pregnancy underweight, you may need to gain a bit more; if you were overweight, perhaps a bit less.) Make sure you're getting enough  urlLink iron , a mineral that's used primarily to make hemoglobin (the part of your red blood cells that carries oxygen). During pregnancy, your body needs more iron for your developing baby and the placenta, and to keep up with your expanding blood volume. Iron-rich foods include lean red meat, poultry, fish, lentils and other legumes, spinach, and iron-fortified cereals.  POP! Your belly button may pop out and stay that way until delivery as your uterus presses upwards. Some people will have trouble breathing as their lungs become cramped with the internal organs. This will usually continue until the baby "drops" or engages into the pelvis. In a first pregnancy this will generally occur 4-6 weeks before your birth and with subsequent pregnancies not until you are in labor. There is a trade off once the baby "drops." You will have to urinate more frequently, hard to believe, eh? Remembering to do your pelvic tilts prior to laying down will hopefully allow you a few more minutes of rest before the next bathroom break.&nbsp; You are half way through your pregnancy! Congratulations!

       Time for my update on GWO V in Chicago.&nbsp; It was, as always, a wonderful weekend with my best friends.  Thursday I left work around 4:00 p.m. and was a bit anxious as the line to check in was extremely long.&nbsp; When I got up to the counter, I found out why.&nbsp; Storms in Chicago had delayed flights all over the place and lucky for me, mine was one of them.&nbsp; My flight was scheduled to leave at 5:25 p.m., but the lady at the desk said it might be 8 or 9 p.m.&nbsp; The bad thing was they didn’t know when it would be.&nbsp; At around 6:15 p.m. they gave us word that the flight from Chicago was in the air and we should be able to leave by 7:15.&nbsp; I went to find something to eat and when I ambled back to the gate around 6:45 p.m., they were boarding!&nbsp; Yeah! &nbsp;Once on the plane we were told that we weren’t allowed to leave until 8:00 p.m., so we were going to go sit on the runway for awhile.&nbsp; We did end up leaving at 8:00 p.m., which got me into Chicago at around 8:30, just 2 ½ hours later than planned.&nbsp; Anyway, Erica and Danialle met me at the airport and the first thing we decided to do was get some food.&nbsp; We just got some McDonald’s and went back to Danialle’s.&nbsp; We chatted for a bit and then decided to walk down to a little restaurant to check out some dessert.&nbsp; It was so nice outside!&nbsp; After we got back we pretty much got ready for bed.&nbsp; I was a bit concerned about the lack of air conditioning, but I had a big fan blowing on me all night, so I actually slept pretty good.  On Friday, we got up in time to take Danialle’s husband to work at 8:30 a.m.&nbsp; We ate some yummy breakfast and then headed back downtown to do a little shopping on Michigan Avenue.&nbsp; There is always so much to look at, but good for my checkbook, no maternity stores!&nbsp; I did end up buying a couple of things anyway, but it was still fun.&nbsp; Heather gave us a call around noon, while we were still downtown, so we headed back to the car and then back to Danialle’s place.&nbsp; Next we decided to put on our beach wear and get some lunch before heading to the beach.&nbsp; We decided on wings, and after some time finally found a BW3’s.&nbsp; Danialle and Erica were brave and got hot ones, but I decided to play it safe.&nbsp; After lunch we hit the beach.&nbsp; It was cold!&nbsp; The wind had really picked up and it wasn’t that warm anyway, but we were determined not to let that stop us.&nbsp; We threw our towels out and picked a spot to chat.&nbsp; Heather fell asleep for a little bit, but the rest of us had some good conversations.&nbsp; I also tried digging a small hole for my belly and laying on my stomach.&nbsp; My &nbsp;pregnant friend Kelly from work said that was how she first felt her baby move.&nbsp; I think it worked for me too.&nbsp; Have you ever layed on a body part in a weird way and you can feel your heartbeat thumping in that body part?&nbsp; It felt like that in my lower abdomen.&nbsp; Only, it wasn’t a consistent, “thump-thump-thump.”&nbsp; It was more like “thump-thump……thump.”&nbsp; Also, if I moved or sat up and then layed back down, I’d feel it again.&nbsp; I’m calling that baby movement.&nbsp; After the beach, we checked into the hotel and all showered and changed.&nbsp; Then we went to Leona’s for dinner.&nbsp; It was ok, but not as great as last time we ate there.&nbsp; After dinner, we walked around a bit until the stores closed up and then went back to the hotel to chat some more and sleep.  Saturday was a day of shopping.&nbsp; We went to Gurnee Mills outlet mall.&nbsp; We got there around 11 and shopped until 6 p.m.&nbsp; Again, I’m glad pregnancy limited my spending on clothing.&nbsp; There was one maternity store and I did by something, but one outfit isn’t too bad.&nbsp; Also, Danialle and Erica tried on the fake bellies at the store.&nbsp; We got a cute picture of us all with bellies.&nbsp; Where I really spent the cash though was at the Carter’s baby store outlet.&nbsp; Everything was so incredibly marked down.&nbsp; They had these $40 diaper bag’s that were only $10 with an additional $35 purchase, so I wanted to be sure I spent $35.&nbsp; I ended up buying 3 long sleeve sleepers, a cute ducky onesie, a super soft blanket, booties, and 2 bibs plus the diaper bag for about $60.&nbsp; After shopping until the verge of dropping, we headed back towards the hotel and decided on Outback for dinner.&nbsp; We got in relatively quickly and had this bizarre waiter.&nbsp; He was Native American, at least bi-sexual, and told us all about his new “Spiritual Love.”&nbsp; He made it interesting though and we spent two hours at the restaurant.&nbsp; It was 10:00 by the time we left and after all that shopping, I was pooped.&nbsp; We all went to bed fairly early.  Sunday morning we got up said our goodbyes and Danialle took me back to the airport.&nbsp; Luckily this trip wasn’t as bad as the way there, except one of my bags didn’t make it back.&nbsp; I checked two, but only one made the plane.&nbsp; I headed home and spent the rest of the afternoon being lazy.&nbsp; My bag was delivered around 7:30 p.m. officially ending my GWO trip.  Spending time with the girls is so great.&nbsp;

       I wanted to get one last post in before the weekend.&nbsp; I’m leaving in 3 hours for Chicago and GWO V!&nbsp; I’m so excited.&nbsp; My personal life has been going great, but work is stressing me out!&nbsp; I just want to complete forget it all for a few days.&nbsp; My girlfriends are my lifesavers.&nbsp; I don’t live close to my family and while I’ve made new (and awesome) friends here, I still feel like these weekends breathe a little life back into me.&nbsp; We’ve got tons planned, but my prediction is we’ll do about 75% of it, and spend the rest of the time talking and catching up.&nbsp; I don’t care.&nbsp; We could hole up in a hotel room for three days and never leave and I think I’d still come away thinking it was a great weekend. Well, I’d like to get my desk mostly cleared off before I go, so I better get to work.

       This weekend Eric's mom came to visit.&nbsp; We had a nice weekend.&nbsp; Friday she got in before we made it home for work and hung out on the deck for a bit.&nbsp; When we got home we chatted for&nbsp;a bit and then had dinner at The Melting Pot.&nbsp; She loved it, and it was fun to get to share a new experience with her.&nbsp; After dinner, we headed to Wal-Mart to walk off dessert and then went home and watched&nbsp; a movie.&nbsp; I fell asleep during it, and then decided to crash for the evening. &nbsp; Saturday, Eric had to go into work for a quick appointment.&nbsp; The appointment got pushed back, however, so we met him and spent some time in a scrapbooking store nearby.&nbsp; Donna wasn't feeling well (headache) though, so when Eric had to go back to the office, we went home and took a nap.&nbsp; I wasn't complaining, I love to nap!&nbsp; Eric came home and woke us up and we did some shopping.&nbsp; We went by&nbsp;a car dealership that was advertising some deals and test drove a Chevy Equinox.&nbsp; We were interested, but in my car and didn't want to subject Donna to an evening of haggling, so decided to meet up with the salesperson Monday to discuss.&nbsp; Then we headed downtown to check out the Jazz &amp; Rib Fest.&nbsp; We parked in my building (for free) and started walking to the festival.&nbsp; A big storm came up though, and we had to duck into a covered opening of a building to wait it out.&nbsp; When the rain started letting up, we decided to head back to the car and skip the festival.&nbsp; We then went to Texas Roadhouse and had dinner.&nbsp; After dinner we drove by another dealership to price some SUV's.&nbsp; After that we decided to go browse at Babies R Us.&nbsp; I can't wait until we get to register.&nbsp; It will be so much fun!&nbsp; I'm starting to feel like I belong in that store now.&nbsp; I saw some bigger bellies than mine, but I count!&nbsp; We also have decided on a theme for the baby's room.&nbsp; We are going to decorate in ducks.&nbsp; If it's a boy, we'll paint the room blue and stencil yellow ducks on the wall.&nbsp; If it's a girl or we can't teel, we'll paint the room green.&nbsp; Either way, we'll do plain yellow bedding and make some yellow curtains.&nbsp; We'll use other duck items to decorate.&nbsp; It should be really cute.&nbsp; We also stopped by Baby Depot inside of Burlington Coat Factory.&nbsp; After they closed, we headed home and watched another movie. &nbsp; Sunday morning we got up around 9:30 a.m. and just visited until Donna left around noon.&nbsp; After she left, Eric and I went car shopping again.&nbsp; We went back to the Toyota dealership and test drove a used 2001 Chevy Tahoe they had on the lot.&nbsp; While the price looked nice, it seemed like more vehicle than we need and I couldn't quit thinking about the gas prices.&nbsp; Then we moved over to a 2001 Toyota Highlander.&nbsp; I love Toyota's and after driving it, we decided to do some paperwork.&nbsp; Eric is leasing his car and when they ran the payoff versus his appraisal, his negative equity was close to $6,000!&nbsp; We knew we might have some to deal with, but that amount put the Highlander (and every other SUV we'd been looking at) out of our price range.&nbsp; So, we decided that an SUV may not be a viable option right now.&nbsp; We then drove over to the Dodge dealership and ended up buying a 2004 Intrepid.&nbsp; It's used, but still under warranty, etc. and we got a great deal.&nbsp; It's also pretty loaded (leather seats, etc.), so it's a really nice ride.&nbsp; Eric's happy and now we have 2 family cars, so we should be set for a while. &nbsp; That's about it for the weekend.&nbsp; I'm really excited about the nursery now.&nbsp; I haven't really seen any duck bedding patterns, so I think this idea is fairly original.&nbsp; I'm ok with using solid color bedding and getting the theme in other places, so it's going to be fun to really put the nursery together.&nbsp; I do want a mobile though and I haven't seen any with only&nbsp;ducks at the baby stores.&nbsp; I did some E-bay research though and found one I'm bidding on.&nbsp; Three more days and it'll be mine! &nbsp; On another note, less than a week until I get to see my best friends!&nbsp; I'm so excited.&nbsp; I thought things were turning around for Erica on the baby front, but it looks like today that may have changed.&nbsp; Darn it!&nbsp; I know she'd be a great Mom, so I want her to get to start soon.&nbsp; I haven't got updates from the other girls I'll be seeing next week, but I'm sure I'll be completely caught up by this time next week.&nbsp; One of my other friends that can't come to our weekend get together, just told me she may be moving up her plans for starting a family.&nbsp; They aren't going to put any effort into it, but they are going to start letting nature take it's course next month!&nbsp; I just want all of my friends to be pregnant too.&nbsp; It would be so great if all three of us could be pregnant together for a few months at least! &nbsp; Ok, I better end for tonight.&nbsp; I'll update this week if anything good happens and next week, you'll get the scoop on GWO in Chicago!

        My Symptoms  Probably my most noticable symptom this week is that I haven't been feeling movement.&nbsp; I'm still pretty sure it's what I felt before, but the baby's been quite this week.&nbsp; I've still got the Doppler though, so I know everything is ok, but I'm just not feeling anything.&nbsp; I've also noticed a little bit of heartburn.&nbsp; Nothing serious, but sometimes when I lay down or lounge on the couch, I feel like I'm not allowing my digestive tract enough room.&nbsp; This will be my last week with the Doppler.&nbsp; I'm taking it with me to my Girl's Weekend, but then sending it back next Monday.&nbsp; The only other thing is that it seems like I'm looking much more pregnant.&nbsp; Now the belly really looks like a pregnant belly, even without clothes.&nbsp; I think I've been gaining weight too (although in reasonable amounts).&nbsp; I can't think of much else.&nbsp; Hopefully, this week I'll get some more kicks or baby movements. &nbsp;  The Baby  Crown-to-rump length of the growing fetus is 5.2 to 6 inches by this week.&nbsp; Your baby weighs about 7 ounces.&nbsp; It's incredible to think your baby will increase its weight more than 15 times between now and delivery.&nbsp;  &nbsp; What's Going On with Your Baby? The fetus is about 8 inches long, 8 ounces in weight, and covered in vernix, a white, cheesy "cream" that protects her skin from the long bath in amniotic fluid. Preemies are covered in vernix at birth -- "posties" have almost none.  &nbsp; Your baby weighs about 8 1/2 ounces, and he measures 6 inches, head to bottom — about the length of a small zucchini. His arms and legs are in the right proportions to each other and the rest of his body now. His kidneys continue to make urine, and the hair on his scalp is sprouting. This is a crucial time for sensory development: Your baby's brain is designating specialized areas for smell, taste, hearing, vision, and touch. If your baby is a girl, she has an astonishing six million eggs in her ovaries. They'll dwindle to fewer than two million by the time she's born.  &nbsp; This is an impressive week for growth! The baby will increase in weight to 8 ounces (227 grams)! If you are having a girl, her ovaries now contain primitive egg cells. Lanugo appears all over the baby's body. This fine hair will remain until birth draws nearer. Sometimes you can still see some on the baby's face and ears after birth. Permanent teeth buds are forming behind the already formed milk teeth buds.  &nbsp;  The Mom  You can feel your uterus about 0.5 inch below your umbilicus.&nbsp; Your total weight gain at this point is between 8 and 14 pounds.&nbsp; Of this weight, only about 7 ounces is your baby!&nbsp; The placenta weighs about 6 ounces; the amniotic fluid weighs another 11 ounces.&nbsp; The uterus weights 11 ounces.&nbsp; Your breasts have each increased in weight by 6.3 ounces. &nbsp; "Your feets too big!" Suddenly, your shoes don’t fit! Some of this might be due to water retention, and some of it is due to the general loosening of ligaments happening throughout your body. Many women's feet grow half a shoe size per child and, in most cases, this change is permanent.  &nbsp; You're just a week shy of the halfway mark. You may notice some achiness in your lower abdomen (perhaps extending to your groin) or even a quick, sharp, stabbing pain on one or both sides, especially when you change position or at the end of an active day. This is  urlLink round ligament pain , and it's caused by the stretching of the muscles and ligaments that support your growing uterus. It's nothing to be alarmed about, but if the pain continues even when you're resting or becomes persistent and severe, call your practitioner.You may also have noticed some skin changes lately. Are the palms of your hands red? Nothing to worry about — it's from increased estrogen. Patches of darkened skin are also common during pregnancy. When they show up around your upper lip, upper cheeks and forehead, they're called  urlLink chloasma , or the "mask of pregnancy." You may see these splotches on your arms or other areas that have been exposed to the sun. Your nipples, freckles, scars, underarms, inner thighs, and vulva may also darken during pregnancy. That darkened line running from your belly button to your pubic bone is called the linea nigra, or "dark line." All of this darkening is due to a temporary increase in melanin, the substance that colors your hair, skin, and eyes. For most women, these darkened spots will fade shortly after delivery. In the meantime, protect yourself from the sun, which intensifies the pigment changes. Cover up, wear a brimmed hat, and use sunscreen when you're outdoors. And if you're self-conscious about your "mask," a little concealing makeup can work wonders. &nbsp; If you have not looked into  urlLink childbirth classes , now is the time to do so.  urlLink Childbirth education  is a great way of informing yourself about pregnancy, labor and birth. There are many different types of classes available and many different types of  urlLink teachers . Enroll now before the spaces are all gone!  urlLink Medical research  indicates that participants in childbirth classes tend to have easier, less stressful births.

       I don’t post much about work.  But, there’s been enough going on that I feel I need to make a comment.  I’ll start by saying that I’ve been happy with my career choices up to this point.  I work in Insurance and work for the largest Insurance Brokerage firm in the world.  I majored in Insurance and Risk Management and actually moved to Columbus for this job.  Over the last year I think I’ve found my niche in the company and have really gotten into a groove as far as my work.  I love the work that I do, I’ve loved the people I work with, I feel challenged by my responsibilities, I feel that people appreciate my work and respect my knowledge, and I feel like this company is very generous to their employees (working hours, vacation, summer hours, pay raises, bonuses, etc.).  However, in the last year, my particular office has been through a lot.  We’ve had some management changes.  One of the head regional people started his own firm and started picking off people to work for him.  We’ve also faced a lot of competitive pressure from other firms.  Our office has been hit really hard lately.  We’ve lost some key business and even more key people.  Yesterday, I overheard someone say that we’ve lost 23 people since January.  This office had about 60-70 people at it’s peak and currently has 52 employees.  Obviously, we replaced some of the people, but in other places we have big holes.  About a month ago, after a trend of losing business to competitors, they had a reduction in staff of 8 people to help “cut expenses.”  One of those people was a very good friend of mine and an extremely hard worker.  It seemed really unfair how random the reduction was.  I know I could have picked some other people that would have been better choices in my mind.  Anyway, things kept plugging away, and then last week, another very key senior person left to go to a competitor.  I was surprised and disappointed, but what can you do?  Then yesterday, my direct supervisor quit to go to the same competitor.  I took it really hard.  I’ve worked really closely with him for the last year.  He is a really great guy.  He was a great boss.  He always made sure to challenge me and let me prove I could handle assignments.  He was really accessible when I had questions, and I was thinking of him as a mentor.  He’s a pretty young guy, and has advanced pretty far pretty quickly.  I consider myself bright and was hoping under his guidance to follow a similar career path.  Anyway, now he’s gone and we have to pick up the pieces around here.  I’m still a bit in limbo.  Every account that I work on, he was also involved with.  Some of them are really complex and he did most of the big picture work while I assisted and learned, and others he let me run with and just backed me up when I had questions or needed help.  Now, I’m not sure what will happen.  With another year of experience, I might have been able to step in and say, “I can handle all this.  Let me take over his book of business.”  But, I don’t think I’m quite ready yet.  I’m hoping they’ll give me a bit more responsibility and let me learn what I haven’t yet on the job, but with all the turmoil in the office, they may want to bring in a more senior person to make the client more comfortable.  I’m only 25 and in this business, I’m a kid.  Clients want a little grey hair on the account and if we walk in and tell them I’m handling it, I’m not sure they’d all see it as a positive.  Not to mention I’ve got a 2 month break coming up in the future.  I’m not really sure what my future holds right now.  If they make cuts again, I think I’m safe, but if not…I could find another job.  I’m qualified and educated and I do know a lot of people at competitors.  I’m hoping the people here will see this as an opportunity and give me the chance to step up and show I can do more.  Or, I could be getting calls from those competitors myself offering me another opportunity.  Long term, I believe this is a great place to be, but I’m also craving a bit of stability right now.  I guess for now, I’ll keep coming to work.  I’ll do my job to the best of my ability and see what happens next.

       I’m now about the 90% sure that at least some of these feelings I’ve been having are the baby.  In the evenings before I go to bed, I use the Doppler to listen to the baby.  With the heartbeat easier to find, I am trying out other areas, listening for the bubble noises (meaning movement).  Last night there were a couple of times that I heard the bubbles in the same area I was feeling the “flutters.”  That made me think, that this could be it.  Then after I’d been asleep, I had to get up around 1:00 a.m. to use the restroom.  When I went back to bed, I was feeling something that was more localized in one area, rather than a random fluttery feeling.  As I was drifting back to sleep, I was thinking, now that was probably a kick.  It’s like a fluttery, poking feeling, but in a specific place, where the other things I’ve been feeling are just randomly in my lower abdomen.  I could point to where I felt this, the other ones, are not as distinct.  I’m sure some of the time, I’ve been confusing the digestive process with movement, but I’m pretty sure last night, was a kick.

        My Symptoms  Not much new to report this week.  I'm still undecided on the baby movement thing.  I'm probably feeling something, but it's not that definate yet.  I'm still on the early side of the "normal" window though, so I expect the next couple of weeks to become more obvious.  Less than 3 weeks until my next ultrasound though!   The Baby  The crown-to-rump length of your growing baby is 5 to 5.6 inches by this week.  Weight of the fetus is about 5.25 ounces.  Your baby is continuing to grow and to develop, but now the rapid growth rate slows down a little.  Those bones are hardening, and the legs are growing longer. The ears are almost in position ("What big EARS you have, baby!" "The better to hear you with, my mother!")  Head to bottom, your baby is approximately 5 1/2 inches long (about the length of a large sweet potato) and she weighs almost 7 ounces. She's busy flexing her arms and legs — movements that you'll likely start noticing more and more. Her blood vessels are visible through her thin skin and her ears are now in position and stand out from her head. Myelin (a protective covering) is beginning to form around her nerves, a process that will continue for a year after she's born. If you're having a girl, her uterus and Fallopian tubes are formed and in place. If your baby is a boy, his genitals are noticeable, though he may hide them from you during an ultrasound.  At 20.5 cms or 8.1 inches total length, your baby is growing rapidly. S/he weighs about 7 ounces (198 grams). The bones are continuing the ossification process. The pads of the fingers and toes are formed and the fingerprints are developing as well.    The Mom  You can feel your uterus just below your bellybutton.  If you put your fingers sideways and measure, it is about two finger-widtsh (1 inch) below your bellybutton. Your uterus is the size of a canteloupe or a little larger.  Your total weight gain to this point should be 10 to 13 pounds.  However, this can vary widely.    If this is your first pregnancy, you may FINALLY be feeling movement! Your skin may be reflecting the pregnancy by darkening in spots. This "mask" of dark pigment around the eyes, nose, and cheeks is called the chloasma, and will slowly fade once you deliver.  Bigger, more comfortable clothes are a must now as your appetite and waistline increase. Look for specially designed maternity clothes that can accommodate your expanding belly.  You may have heard that it's best to lie on your left side during your last two trimesters. Here's why: When you lie on your back, your uterus can compress your pelvic veins — in particular, the inferior vena cava, the vein that returns blood from the lower half of your body back to your heart. Lying on your left side helps remove this pressure. Try placing a pillow behind you, or under your hip or leg for comfort.  Your cardiovascular system is undergoing dramatic changes, and during your second trimester your blood pressure is probably lower than usual. Don't spring up too fast from a lying or sitting position or you might feel a little dizzy.  If you haven't already, you'll probably have an ultrasound done sometime this trimester (usually between 16 and 20 weeks). This painless procedure helps your practitioner check how your baby's growing, screen for certain birth defects, check the placenta and umbilical cord, determine whether the due date you're working with is accurate, and see how many babies you're carrying. During the exam, you might see your baby moving around or sucking her thumb. Bring your partner along, and be sure to ask for a printout for your baby's first photo album!  Sleeping may be increasingly difficult now, as your body grows. Try propping yourself with pillows to help you find a more comfortable sleeping position. You might also try doing pelvic tilts before bed, and always urinate before laying down.

        My Symptoms  It's been a pretty good week.  Very fast.  My possible interesting news?  I think, maybe, I've felt the baby moving.  When it gets stronger I'll probably know for sure, but I've been feeling some feelings that feel "different" than the normal stuff going on in my belly area (digestive rumbles, hunger pangs, gas).  The first time was sometime this weekend (I think Sunday).  I was eating lunch at the couch and had my plate on the coffee table.  I was leaning forward and felt something weird.  Then later I went upstairs to take a nap and layed on my stomach.  With some pressure on my stomach it seemed like I was feeling a lot going on.  I'm not sure I'm feeling the baby, but it's a definate possiblity, since I've felt the same sort of things for the last couple of days.  I'm not really sure how to describe it.  It's kind of like a cross between gas bubbles and when your stomach turn over (think rollercoaster).  I know that doesn't sound pleasant, but it's just like some kind of involuntary movement or motion.  I'm sure in the near future it will be actual nudges or poking.  Assuming what I think I feel now actually is baby related.  Soon enough it'll be obvious.  I also owe you another picture.  I took measurements this morning, I'll try to do a picture tomorrow.  Since the below mentions weight gain, I'll point out I've now gained 2.5 pounds.  Ok, here's what the books and internet say is going on.   The Baby  The crown-to-rump length of your baby is 4.4 to 4.8 inches.  Fetal weight has doubled in 2 weeks and is about 3.5 ounces  By this week, your baby is about the size of your hand spread open wide.  Fat begins to form during this week and the weeks that follow.  Fat is important to the body's heat production and metabolism.  At 17 weeks of development, water makes up about 3 ounces and fat .018 ounce of your baby's body.  In a baby at term, fat makes up about 5.25 pounds of the total average weight of 7.7 pounds.    The fetus is about 6 and 1/4 inches long and weighs 4-5 ounces, about the same size as the placenta. The eyes are more forward than on either side of the face now. Your baby's ears have started to pop from his head and lanugo is beginning to appear on your baby's head and body. What a cutie!  Your baby weighs about 5 ounces now, and he's around 5 inches long — about the size of a large onion. He can move his joints, and his skeleton — until now rubbery cartilage — is starting to harden to bone. His sense of hearing is also developing. The umbilical cord, his lifeline to the placenta, is growing stronger and thicker.   Your baby is forming brown fat deposits under his or her skin, by the end of pregnancy this will account for 2-6% of their total body weight. This will help them maintain their body temperature when they are born. The baby weighs in at about 5 ounces (142 grams). This means that the baby now weighs more than the placenta. No new structures have formed.  Loud noises outside may actually cause the baby to startle.    The Mom  Your uterus is 1.5 to 2 inches below your bellybutton. You are showing more now and have an obvious swelling in your lower abdomen.  By this time, expanding or maternity clothing is a must for comforts sake.  When your partner gives you a hug, he may feel the difference in your lower abdomen.  The rest of your body is still changing.  A total 5 to 10 pound gain by this point in your pregnancy is normal.  You have felt your baby move, or you will soon.  You may not feel it every day.  As pregnancy progresses, movements become stronger and probably more frequent.  Who am I? Where was I going? And where did I put that list of things I should remember? Pregnancy brings forgetfulness -- as usual, the culprit is hormones. You’ll get your brain back someday (hopefully, sooner than later!). Remember to laugh and you’ll muddle through. Muddle through what? What were we talking about?  Each time you go to the doctor or clinic, they dip a strip of paper in a cup of your urine to measure your blood sugar level. What’s with that blood sugar test, anyway? It’s to make sure you’re not developing gestational diabetes, a condition that affects around one to two percent of all pregnant women. When blood sugar levels are controlled (through diet and sometimes medication), women can have normal pregnancies and normal, healthy babies.  On average, most moms are feeling fetal movement by now. Kick, little one, kick!  With more weight up high and out in front of your body, you may feel a bit off-balance as you walk around. Store away your high heels and wear low-heeled shoes to reduce your risk of taking a tumble.You're likely to feel protective of your tummy, and that's good. Trauma to your abdomen could be harmful to your baby and dangerous to you, so be sure to buckle up when you're driving. Keep the lap portion of the seat belt under your belly and very snug across your hips for maximum protection.  Your uterus is now about halfway between your pubic bone and navel. Your secretions all over your body may increase, due to the increased blood volume. So if you are sweating more, have nasal congestion, or are suffering from increased vaginal discharge this is nothing to worry about and will go away after the birth of the baby.

       I know you must all be wondering where I've been, but I've just been busy and somewhat neglecting my blog.  I just came off of a wonderful long weekend, and I'd love to share.  Friday our office closed at noon.  I had a little more to do, so I stayed until almost 1, than left to go to my dentist appointment.  All looks good, although we skipped the x-rays and he told me that my gums may become more sensitive and bleed during pregnancy.  Friday was the Columbus Red-White-and-Boom fireworks display.  Things were already getting pretty crowded downtown when I left at 1 p.m., so we weren't really interested in messing with traffic and the crowds to head back downtown.  We grilled hotdogs and hamburgers and Martin came over (April was out of town).  We attempted to see the fireworks from the deck, but trees and houses were in the way, so we headed back inside to watch them on TV.  Saturday, Eric and I decided to go order the crib.  We decided to buy the one from the store here in town.  It's a little more expensive than some of the online stuff I found, but I've seen this furniture in person and know it's quality.  We ordered the crib which will convert to a toddler bed, the side rails to convert to a full size bed, and a 4 drawer dresser.  We debated on going with a three door dresser which we could have used as a changing table buy putting a pad on top, but thought the larger dresser would be more useful in the long run when the kids are using it as "grown-up" furniture.  Everything should be in by the end of August.  After the crib, we did a little car shopping.  We looked at some SUV's and even test drove one, but we're trying to be smart this time, so we haven't made a purchase yet.  Also, the cable company came and installed our cable internet.  Sunday after church I did some major cleaning.  The house really needed it.  After cleaning we also decided to move the main computer to the basement.  Ever since we've been running both the X-Box Live and Internet, we've been having computer issues.  I think the cable will help with the speed over DSL, but we still were having problems with the Wireless adapter.  The cable modem is connected to the cable line in the basement (as we don't have cable upstairs except in the master bedroom), so we had to put the router in the basement.  This meant the X-Box was connected by ethernet cable to the router and the computer upstairs was connected with the wireless adapter.  We tested both and had them working.  Three hours later...I couldn't get on the Internet.  The X-Box, however, was working fine.  As we've already replaced the wireless adapter once, plus had to reset and reconfigure the router several times, we decided we're tired of it, so we returned the wireless adapter, moved the computer and desk to the basement and have both hard wired to the router.  Monday was a holiday and we treated it as such.  Eric and I slept until noon.  We then just hung out and decided to have a date night.  We went to Wendy's (really exciting) and then played a couple of games of Putt Putt.  It was fun.  Tuesday I also took the day off work.  Eric is taking the whole week off.  We spent the day visiting daycares.  We visited four.  I think we may have found one.  It's the one right behind Eric's office.  For me to look back and laugh later, I'll include the cost.  It's $185 per week.  Not the cheapest one we've found (although we visited the cheapest), but also not the most expensive.  We sat down with the owner and were really impressed by her.  They've been in business 15 years, several of her employees have Masters degrees, her infant teacher has been there 7 years.  They only take 5 infants at a time, so there isn't too much stimulation for the babies.  They have developmental activities and make sure the babies spend time (supervised) on both their bellys and backs.  When the babies are awake they play music, talk to them, hold them.  Bouncy seats are only used during feedings and the child is never in one for more than 30 minutes straight.  They put the babies on a regular schedule for feedings and sleeping.  I've heard that's really helpful when your at home and on the weekends to know that the babies are used to eating and napping at certain times.  I think this is the place.  We'll visit again before the baby starts, but I think it's a definate possibility.  Ok, that's what I've been up to.  Now read this weeks baby update.  I think I may have some interesting news.

       Sorry for the delay.  I had a lot of work to do when I got back to the office today, so I decided to wait until I came home tonight to update.  I had an appointment at 11:30 a.m. today.  Remarkably, they got me in quickly today.  The nurse weighed me (I gained 2 pounds since last time), took my blood pressure (100/50), and had me wait on the doctor.  Dr. D came in and asked how I was doing.  Before she listened to the baby she started with questions.  This time I had some.  1.  Now that I'm getting some energy back, I've been considering going back to the gym.  Since I haven't been in 4 months, what is ok to do?  She ok'd cardio including running (although she said it will become uncomfortable), walking on the treadmill, stationary bike, eliptical, stair master, and swimming.  She said lifting weights is ok, although she suggested using lighter weights and doing more reps.  She even said I could do ab work if it doesn't involve me laying flat on my back. 2.  Speaking of flat on my back...I've never slept on my back, but now since it's hard to lay on my stomach, I start on my side, but wake up on my back.  How bad is this?  She said it's ok, but to try to stay off my back.  She suggested propping a pillow behind my hip, so I wouldn't be able to easily roll back over.  She also said when my belly gets larger, it's more difficult to roll anywhere. 3.  I've been getting lots of headaches again.  Any suggestions other than Tylenol?  Not really.  I try to eat more often, but all she wants to do is Tylenol possibly mixed in with some caffine.  If they get really bad, we can discuss further.  She said most headache complaints come in weeks 14-18, so it's pretty normal. 4.  How long is it safe to travel?  I may have a work trip by plane in August and I know I have car trips in October...  I can travel (any mode) up to week 35.  During car trips stop frequently to walk around and stretch.  Pregnancy makes you more prone to blood clots.  May also have to stop because of all the extra weight on the bladder. 5.  Do you think I'll feel the baby before next appointment?  She has no idea.  She felt both of hers around 16 weeks, but does this for a living.  I may feel it and not realize it.  Also, if my placenta is attached to the front wall of my uterus, it would provide extra cushion and might take longer. 6.  I've read and talked to lots of people that routinely have an ultrasound at around 20 weeks.  Is she planning on doing one then?  Yes.  We can do one at the next appointment!  Yeah! 7.  As an alternative, we were considering a 3D place in Cincinnati.  Her thoughts?  Mixed feelings.  Yes, it's cool to see the baby and the technology is awesome.  But, as a doctor she's not especially comfortable with people using medical technology for entertainment purposes.  "You can't just go to a booth on the street and get a chest x-ray."  She's also not sure if she's comfortable with what they do if they see something abnormal.  If they let us go like it's all fine, than she'd have to call us a couple days later, "You know that ultrasound you did in Cincinnati?  Well, why don't you come in so we can talk..."  After questions, she listened to the heartbeat.  It was easy to find and she said it sounded good.  She didn't calculate a heartrate for me, but seemed to think it sounded fine.  Then the nurse came in and took blood for the Alpha fetalprotein (AFP) test.  It was optional, but it screens for Down's syndrome and Spina Bifida.  I guess there can be some false positives that would require further testing, but we decided to go ahead.  I'm assuming all will come back fine.  If not, we'll discuss this test in more detail.  So that was the appointment.  Afterwards, Eric and I decided to cancel our appointment at the 3D place.  Eric said he was a little unsure all along.  Also, now my doctor is doing an ultrasound that will be covered under insurance and she should be able to tell the sex (assuming baby is cooperative).  Now we'll stick to the plan that if the baby cooperates we'll find out the sex, if not...we'll wait until he/she is born.  Another reason it was fairly easy for me to give up the 3D deal is the timing.  We scheduled it for 7/17.  While that was good in that it was only 2 weeks away, it was also the weekend Eric's mom is coming to visit.  (We're booked every other weekend after 18 weeks in July, and didn't really want to wait until August). Now I think it definately would have been cool for us to take a grandparent along to the appointment, and I'm sure she would have loved it, but I kept thinking about my Mom.  This is her first grandbaby and I know it's hard for her to be so far away anyway.  I really think it would have hurt her feelings a little bit if the other grandma got to be there for an ultrasound.  Not that my Mom would ever say anything like that or actually get angry, but I don't want to even unintentially hurt her.  Now it will be Dr. D, Eric, and I at the appointment and we can share the news with all the grandparents, however, we want.  The next appointment is July 29th at 2:10 p.m. It should be a good one.  Just a warning, that post may be late, as I think we'll make personal phone calls to make the announcement, before letting the reading public know.

       I have two stories to share from last night.   Kids Say the Darndest Things  I have been helping with Vacation Bible School in the evenings this week. I have been doing the nursery, but last night my one child didn’t come, so I helped out with the 1st and 2nd grade class. There was a boy who was quite a handful. At one point the kids were lined up to get drinks at the water fountain and Bobby got ready to flick the girl in front of him in the rear. I said, “No, Bobby.” That turned his attention to me and he aimed his “flicker” at my belly. At this point another little girl asked me, “Do you have a baby in there?” I said, “Yes, I do.” Then she said, “Bobby, don’t! You could hurt the baby. If you hurt it and it doesn’t make it, then it will have to go to COSI.” I then said, “COSI?” She then said, “That’s where they have the babies in the jars.”  For those of you that don't know, COSI is a children's museum here in town that has various exhibits.  One of those exhibits has jars with fetuses in various stages of development.  She must have went to visit at some point and asked her parents where they got the babies.  I’m guessing the answer was that they were babies that didn’t make it, thus, babies that don’t make it go to COSI.  It was a little morbid, but also funny.    Kicks  After I got home from VBS last night, I got a bowl of ice cream and settled down on the couch to watch Big Brother.  Maybe it was the sugar, but Grace was really active.  I was feeling tons of kicks (kind of like right now, come to think of it).  I lifted my shirt, stared at my belly, and watched to see if I could see another kick.  After a while, I did see one, although it wasn’t as obvious as the one I saw on Saturday.  Then I told Eric that I was getting lots of kicks and asked if he wanted to come over and see if he could see or feel one.  He came over and put his hand on my belly where I was getting lots of kicks.  Very quickly we were rewarded.  I got a really big kick and just as I was about to tell Eric that I felt a big one, he said, “I felt it!”  It was so exciting.  I think I was more excited then he was, but I was just so glad to get to share it with him.  Now I’m sure he’ll get tired of me making him feel her move.  The other good thing is that now that I know we can feel it from outside, I may get to let my Mom feel next weekend.  I didn’t know I was going to get to see her before October, but then this trip popped up.  I really hope we have a cooperative baby and she can feel a kick or two.  Another milestone.  First kick felt by Dad, 21 weeks 4 days.

        My Symptoms  I'm definately enjoying the second trimester.  I really feel great.  I haven't even had any heartburn issues this week.  I did get a headache that wouldn't quit and stayed home on Thursday, but other than that, I really feel good.  I really feel (and look) pregnant now, and it's fun to have strangers make comments.  I even got a carry-out at the grocery store and I didn't have to ask.  Grace has been kicking up a storm.  I now know I feel her several times a day, usually in the mid-morning if I'm sitting at my desk and not running around, late afternoon right before I leave to go home, and then now at night while we're just hanging out.  I think Eric is getting anxious to feel her too.  He keeps rubbing my belly and just likes to touch it.  I haven't been sure I've felt it from outside yet, so I don't know if he can.  It's just hard to know sometimes when I have my hand on my belly if I am really feeling it with my hand or if I am imagining it, since I felt it from the inside.  Soon it will be obvious.  Last night I actually saw a kick though.  It was a big one, and I really saw the side of my belly move.  I probably could have felt that one, but I wasn't touching it.  I also was getting lots of little fluttery kicks up by my belly button while we were singing at church today.  I kept staring at my belly though, and didn't see any of those.  Speaking of belly button, I'm thinking it may be possible that mine will pop out before birth.  I've always had a really deep innie, and thought there was no way it would come out.  Now, it's still definately an innie, but I can tell it's much shallower (as in I can see the bottom) and I've still got to get a whole lot bigger.  I guess we'll just wait and see.   The Baby  Your baby now weighs about 12.25 ounces.  Crown-to-rump length at this time is about 7.6 inches.  Your baby continues to grow; its body is getting larger every day.  Your baby's eyelids and even the eyebrows are developed.  Fingernails are also visible.  You’ve got a one pounder in there! Depending upon your particular fetus and pregnancy, it is probably around 10 1/2 inches tall from head to teeny, tiny toes.  Your baby now looks like a miniature newborn, checking in at 10.9 inches and almost 1 pound. Her skin will continue to appear wrinkled until she gains enough weight to fill it out, and the fine hair (lanugo) that covers her head and body is now visible. Her lips are becoming more distinct, and the first signs of teeth are appearing as buds beneath her gum line. Her eyes are developed, though the iris (the colored part of the eye) still lacks pigment. Eyelids and eyebrows are in place, and her pancreas, essential for hormone production, is developing steadily.  The baby is getting bigger and continuing to practice for extrauterine life. This week your baby has developed eyebrows! S/he weighs about 15 ounces (425 grams) and is 27.5 cms or 10.8 inches total length!   The Mom  Your uterus is now about 0.8 inch above your belly button or almost 9 inches (22 cm) from the pubic symphysis.  You may feel "comfortably pregnant."  Your enlarging abdomen is not too large and doesn't get in your way much.  You're still able to bend over and to sit comfortably.  Walking shouldn't be an effort.  Morning sickness has probably passed, and you're feeling pretty good.  It's kind of fun being pregnant now!    Keep up your healthy pregnancy diet. That means lots of calcium, green leafy vegetables, and protein. Watch your intake of fat and sugar. Pretend you’re in training for a marathon. (You are!)  You may start to notice stretch marks on your skin as your abdomen expands to accommodate your growing baby. Some pregnant women never get  urlLink stretch marks , but at least half do. These small streaks of differently textured skin can range from pink to dark brown (depending on your skin color), and they become more apparent as pregnancy progresses. They can appear not only on your tummy, but also on your buttocks, thighs, hips, and breasts. Lotions won't prevent or eliminate them, but they help with any itching. Also, you may no longer be an "innie" — your navel is flat and may soon pop out. It will revert to its usual shape after birth.Another interesting skin quirk you may notice during pregnancy is something called vascular spiders. These are little areas of raised, reddish skin, with tiny branches. Commonly found on the face, neck, upper chest, and arms, they're caused by the higher levels of estrogen in pregnancy, and they usually disappear after delivery.  You are still feeling pretty good and active in this second trimester. If you are still having aches and pains or feel like you are slowing down you may want to look into some different  urlLink remedies .  urlLink Sex  is something that many pregnant couples don't really discuss at length. However, sexuality can change a lot during pregnancy. Usually in the first trimester you are nauseated, your breasts are sore, or you are just too tired. Finding alternate ways of expressing your sexuality without intercourse is appropriate.  In the second trimester libido is usually increased. With the increase blood flow and secretions in the vagina and clitoris, some women become orgasmic or multi-orgasmic for the first time. You do not have to worry about getting pregnant, so this may be the first time in your lives where you weren't trying to get pregnant or trying to prevent a pregnancy.  There is no way that you are going to harm the baby during intercourse, although this is a common fear. The baby is well surrounded by the amniotic sac and blissfully unaware of your actions. Unless you have been told by your practitioner that you should abstain from sex, it is a very healthy activity to engage in while pregnant.  As you head into the third trimester creativity can be key. New positions will most likely take place, but studies have shown that there are very few reasons that you can't have sex up until the birth! Your practitioner will let you know if you should abstain from intercourse.

       I thought I should maybe give an update on what baby related tasks I've completed.  Things are starting to get more real and I think it's sinking in that in about 4 months, I'll have a new baby at home!  There's a lot to do to prepare.  We kind of waited on a lot of it until we knew what we were having, but now it seems like we're in full swing.  Here's what we've done.  1.  Ordered crib and dresser - We did this at the beginning of July, but it should be arriving soon.  I can't wait! 2.  Purchased fabric for curtains - Samara is making curtains for Grace's room, so last weekend she and I picked out the fabric.  She has it now and is planning on getting them made maybe this weekend.  I'll post pictures when they are done. 3.  Picked out paint colors - We haven't actually bought paint yet, but we have decided on a color.  I'll probably do picks after painting. 4.  Cleaned out Room - We still have to get the bed and dresser out of the room, but everything else has been cleared out.  I even have baby outfits hanging in the closet. 5.  Officially registered for Daycare - We dropped off the check to reserve our spot for February this week. 6. Picked out a Glider - My Mom and Dad have already told us they want to buy us this, so today we officially confirmed which one we want.  It is so nice, and should match the wood of our furniture.  Today we had to just check and make sure the ottoman was included (it is!).  They are going to give us the cash and let us go pick it up, since it would be too difficult to transport at showers, etc.  I tried to find it online, to link to, but it's not there. 7.  Registered - We did this today.  It was so fun, but overwhelming.  I kind of felt bad scanning so many items, but we do need all the stuff.  We spent about 3 hours at Babies R Us.  All of our big items are there, but also lots of mid and lower priced items too.  Probably my favorite (and most expensive) is the  urlLink Travel System (Stroller &amp; Carseat Combo).     It's so nice.  Then we had lunch and went to Target.  We were such pros that it only took us about 20 minutes there.  Target has mostly lower priced items.  We may have to go in and update again.  For example, I didn't register for any wipes.  I'm sure there are other items we missed.  Also, we didn't really register for any outfits.  We picked lots of onsies and sleepers, but figure people will buy us the cute clothes, right?  Both registries should be available online.  I would link, but I don't want to put our last name on here.  If you know me, you can figure out how to look it up.  The cool thing about Babies R Us, is that even if people don't have one near them, they can look items up online and then either purchase and have shipped to us or they can call the store near us and purchase over the phone and then the store will call us and tell us we have a gift to pick up.  That way the buyer doesn't have to pay for shipping.  That seemed cool to us. 8. Bought a lamp - After registering at Target, we were looking around for more grown-up items and in the furniture section happened to find a duck lamp!  It was the rice paper kind, but only $10, so of course we had to buy it.  I didn't get a bulb though, so it doesn't work yet, but it will be very cute.  I think that's about it, but we're on our way.  Now I'm excited for showers and to start actually bringing some of this stuff home!  I know we'll probably get some of it ourselves.  For example, once the crib and dresser arrive and we have the painting done, I'm sure I'll want to get some of the bedding and crib mattress that we registered for.  I don't want to wait for the shower for the nursery to start looking like a nursery!  Don't worry, there's still plenty more for other people to buy us.  Oh yeah, one more thing.  I received a mysterious package earlier this week.  It came in the mail in a padded envelope with a return address of James Schmidt in Sarasota, FL.  It was a book called "Belly Laughs" by Jenny McCarthy (old host of MTV's Singled Out).  It's a pregnancy book and actually very good, but I don't know where it came from.  It reminded me of how something arrives that you buy on E-Bay, but I didn't buy it.  There was no note  or anything either.  I'm sure someone must have bought it for me, but no one mentioned it to me.  If you bought this book and had it shipped to me, thank you, but please leave a comment or call and let me know!  Thanks!  Ok, that's about it for now.  I'll update tomorrow with my weekly update including how I'm feeling.  Remind me to talk about my belly button...

       I love my baby. There's nothing more wonderful than feeling these little rolls and kicks inside me and knowing that she's alive and growing and all mine. I'm anxious for the time when Eric can feel her too, but it's kind of nice having it all to myself right now. My favorite is when I'm sitting at my desk at work and all the sudden I get this nudge, like she's saying, "Hey, Mom, don't work too hard. Don't forget about me!" Then I go get a snack.  Tonight I felt this weird feeling and then pressure on the lower end of my belly. It was like she was stretching or something. Then I touched the spot where I felt the pressure and it was really hard. I wonder if it was a little head or back or butt pushed up against my belly. It won't be long before those kicks can be felt from the outside. Ok, off to bed.

        My Symptoms & Rambling Thoughts  I feel good.  Except for the occasional headache or bout of heartburn, I feel very...normal.  I am thinking this pregnancy thing isn't so hard...ask me again in three months.  I am amazed at the amount of movement I've been feeling over the last week.  It was like once I was sure I felt her, she moves all the time.  I love it.  It's still move vague rumbly feelings than distinct kicks, but I get some of those too.  Now I just can't wait until they get a little stronger and Eric can feel them too.  I'm also more adjusted to the fact that we're having a girl now.  I don't know why, but for some reason a daughter seems like so much more of a responsibility to me.  I don't know why.  Maybe because I am a woman and rather than just nurture and provide for a child, I have to be an example of what she should be.  I'm not sure I'm up to that.  I know I always looked at my Mom as a shining example of what it meant to be a good woman, wife, and mother.  I hope my daughter can see me that way.  I guess maybe this is why my Mom spent so much time praying and talking to God.  I'm going to need some serious help.  One more tidbit before I get into developmental stuff.  Today at church we sang Amazing Grace.  One portion of the verse really touched me, even though I know that I am not taking it as it was written, bear with me.  "Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, and grace my fears relieved. How precious then, that grace appeared, the hour I first believed."  Thinking about my pregnancy and experience.  I just pointed out how becoming a mother has added some fears to my experience.  But, knowing that I will have my Grace is such an amazing source of joy.  The best part is the end.  I got pregnant when I decided to let God take back control of my life.  "How precious then that Grace (my child) appeared, the hour I first believed (gave it back to God)."  Maybe it's hormones, but it brought a tear to my eye.  One more thing, I love it when Eric asks me how his daughter is doing.  Doesn't daughter seem so much more "real" than "baby?"   The Baby  Your baby is getting larger in this first week of the second half of pregnancy.  It now weighs about 10.5 ounces, and it's crown-to-rump length is about 7.2 inches.  It is about the size of a large banana.  It’s about 14 ounces and a hiccupping fool! Yep, hiccups are those little jerky motions you may feel -- it’s her little lungs practicing the important task of breathing.  Your baby now weighs about three-quarters of a pound and is approximately 10 1/2 inches long. His eyebrows and eyelids are fully developed. And you can certainly feel him move. He's oblivious to your schedule, though, so don't be surprised if he starts working out just when you're settling down for the night. If you're having a girl, her vagina is formed now, though it will continue to develop until birth.  Your baby can still move all over in the  urlLink amniotic fluid . Towards the end of this trimester the baby will begin to settle, usually in a head down position (Although some babies do not turn head down until late in the last trimester.). About 3-4% of babies will remain in a  urlLink breech position . Your baby weighs just under a pound (13 ounces or 369 grams).   The Mom  You can feel your uterus about half an inch above your bellybutton.  At the doctor's office, your uterus measures almost 8.5 inches from the pubic symphysis.  Your weight gain should be between 10 and 15 pounds.  By this week, your waistline is definately gone.  Your friends and relatives - and strangers, too - can tell you're pregnant.  It would be hard to hide your condition.  You’re probably finally showing. As you begin to get bigger and bigger, you may wonder about the safety of traveling while pregnant. Here are a few tips: - I f you’re traveling by car, take a break every hour to keep your circulation up! - Always use your seat belt. Buckled low on your lap, it should cause no discomfort and may save lives -- the lives of both you and your baby. - Travel in the final month ONLY if you are prepared to have your baby on the road. In any case, check it out with your caregiver first. - Airplane air is very dry. Keep yourself hydrated by dosing yourself with water and juice throughout the flight (no alcohol, but that should go without saying!). - Many airlines require a doctor’s note if you are traveling in the third trimester. Call the airline to determine the policy, and call your doctor to find out the recommendations BEFORE you buy those non-refundable, non-changeable tickets.  You're probably feeling pretty comfortable these days. You're not too big yet, and the usual aches and pains associated with early pregnancy are, for the most part, gone. Relax and enjoy it while you can — the third trimester will bring some mild discomfort from carrying a baby who is nearly full-term.That's not to say you don't have some minor glitches to deal with now. Increased oil production may have given you a mild case of acne, for example. If that's the case, be diligent about washing well with a gentle soap and water twice a day, but don't take any oral acne medications — or even use any topical acne products — without checking with your practitioner first.You're also prone to  urlLink varicose veins  now (especially if your mom has them). That's because pregnancy puts added pressure on the veins in your legs. (Your blood volume is increased and your uterus puts pressure on the inferior vena cava, the large vein that returns blood from the lower half of your body to your heart.) As if that's not enough, an increase in the hormone progesterone causes the walls of your blood vessels to relax, so as your baby and uterus grow, the veins can become more and more prominent. Varicose veins tend to worsen with each pregnancy, and while they're most likely to show up in your legs, they can also appear on your vulva.If your legs ache, put maternity support hose on first thing in the morning. Increasing your circulation with a brisk walk each day can also help, as can elevating your legs and sleeping on your left side with your feet propped up with a pillow.  Everyone is probably telling you what sex your baby is using  urlLink different myths ! Some people find this fun, other find it annoying. Using things like how you carry, the  urlLink Chinese Gender Chart , or other  urlLink myths  are fun, but not always accurate. Have you decided whether you want to find out the gender of your baby? There are many things to  urlLink consider  before doing so, and still your baby may not  urlLink cooperate .
