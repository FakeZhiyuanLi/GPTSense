      Just came back from Farenheit 9/11...  Impressions?  While he makes some good points, Moore comes off as an aging hippee liberal douchebag.  Liberal propaganda.  But if it stirs up some more anti-Bush sentiment, I'm all for it.

      I had a horrible, horrible dream-nix that, nightmare-last night.  I had a dream that I was forced into marriage.  I was engaged to this guy from high school who I haven't thought about in years.  And he still had the braces.  Woke up in a cold sweat.  I'm still terrified.  Note to self:  try not to get sold into white slavery today.

      I am addicted to this movie.  I freeze frame Perry Farell's penis 3-4 times a week. It's nice.  This film is so gritty, so raw...and so utterly romantic.  I'm not the type of person that would usually get choked up, but some of the scenes are really heartfelt. Perry has that energy around him.  He's like a really great gay man who loves fashion and  will still fuck you.  I always fast-forward Casey Niccoli's scene where she shoots up with the  phone cord tied around her arm.  I have to say that she is fucking hot as well.  I love the Santerian wedding, the way Jane's "Classic Girl" kicks in, and P. Farrell HOT AS FUCK.

This was during the time that Perry and Casey were completly hooked. I always fast-forward Casey Niccoli's scene where she shoots up with the  phone cord tied around her arm.  I have to say that she is fucking hot as well.  I love the Santerian wedding, the way Jane's "Classic Girl" kicks in, and P. Farrell HOT AS FUCK.

      Another thing that irks me:  People who come in and ask for Rammstein, but pronounce it "Ram-Stein."  Like it's some Jewish guy.    Also,  "Warshing-ton" (Washington) Y'ins (As in, "Y'ins got that Kid Rock cd.  Me and my 'ol lady love that song, 'Cadillac Pussy.'")

      Ok, I'd like to take this moment in time to express my utter disdain for all of the asshole emo kids that come in the store.  Or just in general.  Yep, I am anti-emo.  I think we should build a section just for them.  Smoking, non-smoking, emo phags.  They are (generally) fucking assholes.  And their music sucks.  I would rather hear the death rattle of my only child than listen to that shit.  I know, it takes all kinds, but...some things can't be helped. How did emo happen?  Can we go back in time to make sure it doesn't happen again?  I think it was one kid.  He got the wrong idea from hearing too much Shudder to Think and hardcore.

      http://www.mtvu.com/music/request_video  Here is the link for the new SP video.  Some fine breakdancing... still, a lame as fuck video.  Cheesy ending.  This is a video I would expect from some watered-down industrial group, like Crappity Kills.  Still digging TGWOTR.  My favorite Skinny Puppy album to date.  Although it's no Rabies or VIVISECT IV, I like the direction they are taking.  Forward-thinking industrial-it's about fucking time!  After listening to all the "new" industrial releases of note, this was a breath of fresh air.  I had almost written "industrial" (if you can even still call it that anymore-dead genre) off entirely.  Groups like Zeromancer and all the Cleopatra/Metropolis shit had put me off of even listening to industrial anymore.  Thank Jeebus for the Pup.  All praise the Kevs!
