        You are Form 9,  Vampire : The Undying.   "And The Vampire was all that remained on the blood drowned creation.  She attempted to regrow life from the dead.  But as she was about to give the breath of life, she was consumed in the flame of The Phoenix and the cycle began again."   Some examples of the Vampire Form are Hades (Greek) and Isis (Egyptian). The Vampire is associated with the concept of death, the number 9, and the element of fire. Her sign is the eclipsed moon.  As a member of Form 9, you are a very realistic individual.  You may be a little idealistic, but you are very grounded and down to earth. You realize that not everything lasts, but you savor every minute of the good times.  While you may sometimes find yourself lonely, you have strong ties with people that will never be broken.  Vampires are the best friends to have because they are sensible.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        Your soul is bound to the  Solitary Rose : The Alone.   "When I wake up alone, the shades are still drawn on the cold window pane so they cast their lines on my bed and lines on my face."   The Solitary Rose is associated with loneliness, melancholy, and patience.  It is governed by the goddess Merope and its sign is The Sword, or Unrequited Love.  As a Solitary Rose, you may be summed up as a hopeless romantic.  You desire love and have so much love to give, but thing just never seem to work out the way you want them to.  In life, you can be very optomistic, even when things are gray and nothing works out to your expectations.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

        You are a gryphon...You really don't care all that much. Some of you may, but thats basically the stereotype of the gryphon. You are neutral, and can care less if someone is being attacked. You love to fly, high up...way up, above others, where you can just..get away from everything. You are sometimes a loner, but you may have a huge group of friends, some you may not talk to as much, but you do have a few close friends that you can trust and confide in.

People know they can count on you in a crunch, in a jam, and in other food metaphors describing times of desperation. You give the gift of hope, but more importantly, you give the gift of kidney. Your rewards in life will be great, or at least better than other people's. To quote a fortune cookie: "You are soon have a fortunate experiences."

        You are one of the few out there whose wings are truly  ANGELIC . Selfless, powerful, and divine, you are one blessed with a certain cosmic grace. You are unequalled in peacefulness, love, and beauty. As a Being of Light your wings are massive and a soft white or silver. Countless feathers grace them and radiate the light within you for all the world to see. You are a defender, protector, and caretaker. Comforter of the weak and forgiver of the wrong, chances are you are taken advantage of once in awhile, maybe quite often. But your innocence and wisdom sees the good in everyone and so this mistreatment does not make you colder. Merciful to the extreme, you will try to help misguided souls find themselves and peace. However not all Angelics allow themselves to be gotten the better of - the Seraphim for example will be driven to fighting for the sake of Justice and protection of those less powerful. Congratulations - and don't ever change - the world needs more people like you.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      1.  You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and free.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is stylish.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is insecure.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your partner is one that you care not only about the present but also the future with your partner, a long-lasting relationship that you can grow with.  6.  You can't resist desire and lust; most probably you'll commit adultery.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married, you'll treasure it and your partner very much.  8.  At this moment, you are quite self-centered; you think of love as something you can get and trash anytime you want.

        LOVING ONE. You need  safety in your relationship. You want to  be sure in his/her arms, knowing that he will protect you and you can be totally devoted to your other. At this point you are very vulnerable. You open yourself and dont even think that he/she could cheat you. You totally trust your partner in every single way. SO if you find out that she/he lied to you or played a game this trust is broken. You may try to forgive your other but this will be very difficult.He/She has to be friendly and trustworthy.    urlLink   	~THE big LOVE TEST!! What do you need? With PICS!

      some people..the expect too much..people, in my opinion, should go with the flow..i mean, i understand some people have their problems..so they go to their friends and ask for help.  but some expectations..they're too much.  people go to their friends for help but their friends have their own problems..i dont like when people expect so much..especially when they know they're not gonna get what they want...i dont know..i mean, i dont really expect anything but when good things come my way i accept it..and the same with bad things.  and..basically..you get what you give..

        You belong on a lazy-day beach or anywhere where you can set up a relaxing bench or chair and watch the world go by. You don't want to make any changes, watching is enough to make you content. The blue of the sky and the light of day beat into your soul and you drift into the world and around without harming anything or making any ripples in the fabric of humanity.

                 You Are an Indifferent Ex  You're not one of those girls who thinks about her exes - or even remembers them  "Love 'em and Leave 'em" is your motto. And your break ups tend to be a clean break.  It's a nice strategy to have, and guys appreciate your total lack of emotional baggage.  But just a little reminder: it is okay to remember the good parts of your past, even with exes.      urlLink  What Kind of Ex Are You?

        You have a beautiful soul! These are rare and very special. One who has a beautiful soul has beauty inside and out, and are always very kind. You may be the one who always applies make-up to look better and achieve certain standards, but you look just as gorgeous without makeup. You take pride in yourself because you know that you are worth better. Sometimes you preen in front of the mirror for hours, but youre never too busy to help someone. Everyone loves you and you love them back, with a lot of friends, and popularity. But you didnt get it because of your clothes-you got it because there seems to be a radiance around you, a sort of glow, that attracts people to do better and be better.    urlLink   What Kind of SOUL do you posses?

      I close my eyes when I get too sad I think thoughts that I know are bad Close my eyes and I count to ten Hope it's over when I open them  I want the things that I had before Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door I wish I could count to ten Make everything be wonderful again  Hope my mom and I hope my dad Will figure out why they get so mad Hear them scream, I hear them fight They say bad words that make me wanna cry  Close my eyes when I go to bed And I dream of angels who make me smile I feel better when I hear them say Everything will be wonderful someday  Promises mean everything when you're little And the world's so big I just don't understand how You can smile with all those tears in your eyes Tell me everything is wonderful now  Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now  I go to school and I run and play I tell the kids that it's all okay I laugh aloud so my friends won't know When the bell rings I just don't wanna go home  Go to my room and I close my eyes I make believe that I have a new life I don't believe you when you say Everything will be wonderful someday  Promises mean everything when you're little And the world is so big I just don't understand how You can smile with all those tears in your eyes When you tell me everything is wonderful now  No No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now No No, I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now  I don't wanna hear you say That I will understand someday No, no, no, no I don't wanna hear you say You both have grown in a different way No, no, no, no I don't wanna meet your friends And I don't wanna start over again I just want my life to be the same Just like it used to be Some days I hate everything I hate everything Everyone and everything Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now...  I don't wanna hear you tell me everything is wonderful now

       people piss me off...like today i had an argument with someone...she's all like why can't you and this guy learn to accept each other and be nice to each other...i'm just like why should i be the one to accept things...why cant she just accept that we're never gonna be nice and we're never gonna be friends again? get over it....and she's like "it's like you never want to hang out anymore or ur always out." sorry but i've got other friends just like you do...and sometimes i just wanna stay home..but how can you say i never wanna hang out when you never ask me to?  i've got so much more to say but it's not gonna be said now...maybe later..
