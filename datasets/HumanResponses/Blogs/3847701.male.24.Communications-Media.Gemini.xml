						    I bet you all want to know about Prew the Man. Oh I know you all know about Prew the Myth, but i know you really want to see the real man behind the legend. Whats lies beneath that calm nonchalant exterior is a man not to be messed with. Fear this man, he will drink you under the table, then calmly crawl under&nbsp;aswell&nbsp;and slit your throat. His mind tricks however far outweigh his vicious physical prowess. He has been known to spend the day at work communicating with his colleagues (of which I am one) using only strange murmuring noises, I hope the camera footage is still on the companies security system, because it witnessed the rare collapse of an entire workforces sanity over the period of eight hours. We all clocked in in the morning as calm rational humans (on paper anyway) but when we clocked out that evening, we were physically shaking from the emotional turmoil, our hair had been crudely cut with stanley knives still bearing the rabid spittle we produced at the point of mental breakdown and our clothes had gone from our&nbsp;pitifully broken bodies. Sadly, the management didn't notice any difference.     &nbsp;   It is too late for us now, we are lost and destined to a life of souless inanity (and that's just work related), Prew has inflicted far worse on us. We are retches, mere shadows of our former selves, the man is a killer. Fear him.

						   Ok i realise a blog is supposed to be updated everyday, but alcohol waits for no man etc. As I have been repeatedly reminded, i am a lazy bugger :D  Todays installment is the Ice Cream Friday!  After much deliberation on the idea of the Ice Cream Sundae (if anyone can tell me why they are called this i would be immensely grateful!) i have decided to start a tradition of my own, on a Friday, by far the best day of the week, as all who aren't bums (unemployed) or professional bums (students) will testify.  By creating a range of alcoholic ice cream and ice lolly based alcoholic treats i hope to bring inebriation and refreshment to the masses at the same time. Current ideas include Lager Floats, Vodka Screwballs, JD and coke lollies and Tequila Traffic lights. Feel free to let me know any ideas or possible trademark infringement!  /Monkey Power!

						   Well after much deliberation and pondering (about 2 mins after reading Mr Kinackins random ranting, and saying 'go on dude') i've decided to join the suberversive cult that is Blogdom. (This is a potential religion in my book, not like the sad gits that all put 'Jedi' in their census forms, you know who you are!)  Current deliberations are whether to get a mullet or an 80s style power perm, and try to make a career by performing terrible 80s rock songs as a shorter fatter version of some spandex wearing ponce, the only drawback being i can't sing, but hey this never stopped anyone! This is the way forward i feel for mine and Ricks future boy band 'Fat Guys From Oldham'. More band updates as soon as we think of them in the hours of extreme boredom we endure daily.  /Evil Monkey signing out

						    I ponder too much, its official. When i am working i am thinking, when i am walking i mentally wander, it will be the death of me one day. Todays idle thought is the origin of the saying "fuck knows". Who is this fuck who holds such knowledge? where did he come from, where did he go and how exactly does he know so damn much about EVERYTHING?. where are my keys? Fuck knows. Why is my Pay slip vaguer than a leaflet on alziemers disease? Fuck knows. Why, no matter how hard i conceal my email, does that guy from nigeria ALWAYS manage to track me down? Fuck knows. Why the hell does my car take five minutes to start in the morning? Fuck knows (though admittably i have a vague idea why too) Why do i never win the lottery yet always win stuff on the internet? Fuck knows. Why am i even writing all this crap? Fuck knows.      So why wont Fuck share some of this goddam knowledge?!? Fuck knows, but he sure aint telling.

       It had to happen (well it didnt really, but i had previously said it would so i may as well do it now).This is a "spin-off" of the Cardboard Jungle posts on kinackin.net. Hopefully we can chronicle the trials and tribulations we encounter on a daily basis (it will be a community blog with all the animals of the jungle contributing).       I have nothing to add at the moment as i am currently hunting down aforementioned animals and harrassing them into getting a blogger account.
