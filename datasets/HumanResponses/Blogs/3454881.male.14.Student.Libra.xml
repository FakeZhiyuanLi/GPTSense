      Vote for Larry Diedrich for congress because he is the best candidate for South Dakota. Question: I thought we were a republican state? If Stephanie Herseth wins, then we will have all democrats in the Congress and Senate! So PLEASE vote for Larry Diedrich.

      I am a republican and I love it! And here are some things that I believe is right. (you may not agree, but this is what I think, k?): 1. I want the tax cuts to be permanent 2. I believe the Iraq War was the right thing to do because we had to get a dictator out of power and stop him from oppressing his ppl. 3. We have to stay in Iraq until we hand over the power and even then, help them if they need it. 4. Democrats are wrong. 5. The media has a liberal bias. 6. Abortion: I think it should be restricted so that only ppl who have been raped or are in danger of their own lives can get abortion. 7. George W. Bush is a very good president. 8. I dislike Kerry. I just don't trust him in any way. 9. We must reduce the national deficit. 10. Improve the economy!!

      Today was the last day of school for Sioux Falls public schools. It was a great time with a lot of fun and laughter all around. But along with the happiness, there came some sorrow. We may never see eachother again because some of us are going to different high schools. But anyway, have a GREAT summer! I hope everybody has a good time! Shout out to all my friends from Patrick Henry: I'll miss you all going to Lincoln :-(, and I'll see you next year all the Washington Ppl!   Fun times, Jared D.

      Are all Democrats mean hearted? Do you think they "think"? I mean, isn't it common sense that you would have to at least treat people with a little common sense? Well, Tim Johnson (D-South Dakota(GO SD!))discriminated republicans and saying that they were "terrorists"!!!!! He "tried" to apologize today, but to me, he failed. You know why? He said, "I'm sorry if I offended anyone." ... Is that it? Were you waiting for an apology on making the comment? Well he didn't. Which makes him "mean hearted" don't you think? That's what I think, thank you.

      As you should know by now, living in South Dakota can give you a wind blown hairstyle in an instant. In other words; IT'S REALLY WINDY HERE! I think we should expand our energy resources to wind and/or solar energy. Wind is free. Wind is inevitable. It's a very "bright" idea to conserve natural resources and help our environment considerably. We need to push our congressmen and woman to make our state cleaner. Here's a fact for ya; we waste about 60 million dollars on coal and that coal pollutes our rivers and lakes with some mercury. We need to take affirmative action, NOW!

      These are things that are almost doomed to happen...  1. The economy will bomb 2. Unimployment will reach 8.9% 3. We will lose the war on terror 4. There will be one or more terrorist attacks 5. Taxes will go up  Here's some good things:  1. The minimum wage will go up 2. uhh..that's it

      It's been a sad day because one of our former presidents died. Ronald Reagan died today at age 93 with his children at his side. If you didn't know, he had alzhaimers disease. He most defiantly was one of the greatest presidents ever. We all knew he was going to die but today? America will miss him. America will remember him as a prestigious Republican. I defiantly believe he's someone to look up to.

      Today, ppl over 18 are going to vote for our empty seat in the House of Rep. Adults will vote for: 1. Larry Diedrich (R)                   or 2. Stephanie Herseth (D)  I believe that both of these people will make South Dakota a Great place no matter what party they're in. If I could vote, I probably would vote for Larry Diedrich not because he's a Republican, but because he is the most experienced and I believe he would know what he would be doing.  J.D.

      Motivation...What motivation! Have you noticed yet that all that Kerry has for support is to "get bush out". That doesn't explain anything about why we need him out. They're practically racist the way they say it so plainly, "we need him out". Ok, another thing, when asked what Kerry's (or Edwards) plan of action is they...well, here's an example: "What supports what Kerry or Edwards wants to do?" "well what is the support for bush?"   Get a clue ppl, don't ask questions when somebody has asked you one. You know why? BECAUSE IT SHOWS (very well) THAT YOU HAVE NO CREDIBLE EVIDENCE AND IT SHOWS THE WEAKNESS IN THE KERRY "KAMPAIGN". We must defeat this or the democrats must get other things to get bush out rather than "we need him out period".  The potential is unlimited.

      If you live around the area of Sioux Falls you were probably hit by two floods that cause major damage to many residents. Those people are wondering if the cities Sewer systems can get rid of the water quick enough. The city of Sioux Falls took a high tech camera to check out the condition of the cities Sewer System. They found something very suprising to them, they had just found a gas line right in it. If a big storm went through the area, debris and a lot of water travel through there making that very dangerous. If somebody would just throw a lit cigarette it could blow up the whole street! This high tech camera also found Cable, phone, electric, and city water lines down there! MidAmerican (the company responsible for the gas lines) says that it trusts it's employees to build it right. MidAmerican and the other company's says will start fixing the problems as early as next Tuesday.  This story was written by Jared Drenkow, the Info came from KDLT.

      Police today found a surveillance video at a department store the day Lori Hacking died. He is shown looking at his hands constantly, taking something out of his watch, and not making eye contact with fellow costumers. His early morning trip to the store at 1:30 a.m. (July 19) proofed that he wasn't sleeping at the time he said he was. He is seen in the store with hospital pants and buying lime-flavored cigarettes. Mark and his wife were seen at that same store earlier that night and many believe that that was the last times she was seen alive. Investigators still think Lori was killed in her apartment and is buried somewhere under the 3,000 tons of trash.  This story was written by Jared Drenkow, the info came from Fox News.

      Grrr! I hate watching and listening to people who support Kerry!  THEY ARE SO ANNOYING!  AHH! They talk way to fast and they barely make any sense, let alone they don't have any common sense. I also hate it when they attack Bush. (Haha, Kerry wants Bush to not attack him but him and his supporters attack Bush ALL THE TIME!) A big thing that pisses me off is when the supporters of the Kerry Kampaign lie! They lie ALL THE TIME about Bush (and even themselves ;-) ) His supporters are always so "antsy", they are like mad all the time (including Kerry). Should we trust a president who's always mad/angry/pessimist????  The potential is locked for them! HAHA

      Let me tell you something that may hurt the Kerry Kampaign. You know when he talkes about his war experience? Well, he has practically  NONE!  Here's a fact, he only served in Vietnam for 4 months! That's barely anytime to get into action and cause an impact. Most of his coligues served for years! Not months. I get really annoyed when he uses his "experience" to influence people. I also get annoyed when he says he will use his experience to win the war on terror. hmm...what experience..?  Oh yea, how did he get those 3 purple hearts anyway????  The potential is unlocked.
