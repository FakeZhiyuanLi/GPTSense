       urlLink Similarminds.com : Take the ADVANCED ENNEAGRAM test... the number in the barcode on the LEFT (your concious self) is the relevant number.    Like me, I'm an 8w9.  Most of the people that I REALLY enjoy talking to are 8's.  Anyway... then, go to  urlLink The Enneagram institute  and read about yourself.  If you go to  urlLink The Compatibility Page , you can compare yourself to other types.  It's cool to see how everyone works.  Leave a comment with your type!

      I made it through most of my birthday in good shape.  Up until Erick and Jessica came and picked me up, to go to dinner.  Erick got mad at me because I told him to make a right (he wanted to go left), and he started giving me the silent treatment again, so I told him what I thought of that... and told them to take me home.  I made it into the house without crying... hah yay me.   urlLink Grow  is some stupid Japanese game... it's really addictive.  Silly asians.

      I suppose everyone has a mulit-faceted personality, to some extent. I happen to be bi-polar in a feminine sort of way... (it's called PMDD, which means I'm prone to great bouts of depression for two weeks out of the month, and I have the other two weeks where I'm a bit excitable and spastic).   Fortunately, I take medication for this, which cuts down on my "bad weeks". Normally (aka: unmedicated) on a bad week, I'm borderline suicidal, prone to laying around the house sobbing for no reason, and just overall annoyingly incompetent at handling my life. I've dumped TONS of boyfriends during my "bad weeks"... I've lost jobs... I've -2ed my way through tons of Uber Posts... yeah, anyway. Since I now take Zolft half the month, I don't have this problem. Instead I turn into a calm, adle-brained pasifict. Nothing makes me mad, nothing depresses me, but.. also, nothing is exciting or interesting. While I'm on Zoloft my brain does this, "baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa".   Then when my (watch out guys, here it comes...) period starts, I stop taking the Zoloft, and I'm myself again.   By 'myself', I mean, I am a spaz.   As a whole, I'm a pretty outgoing, talkative, jovial type person. I laugh loud, I jokingly hit people (because I get excited and my arms start flapping as much as my mouth), I act out stories... I'm pretty, well... for lack of a better word... I'll say "spastic" one more time.   This includes carrying a hacky-sack around work and throwing it at co-workers when they aren't looking... it includes getting so excited about stuff that I call people, and start yelling stories or ideas at them... "corinne, haha, calm down, what?"...   I also tend to write rambling posts on uber... right?   I also blush a LOT. Just two weeks out of the month I turn into a blusher. I feel it... my face gets hot, then I look at the person I'm talking to, and they start to grin... "awww, you're blushing ha ha ha ".   Yeah, go to hell, I know I'm blushing.   I blush for no reason. I was talking to a customer about her horse the other day... I could tell I was blushing. I have no idea why.   I think most girls talk about their emotions with utter abandon... "oh, I like you sooo much!" and various things of that nature. I can NOT do that comfortably, it makes me blush.   If someone shakes my hand- I blush... even worse, if they KISS my hand, I'll blush and do a stupid girly giggle... argh!   What the hell was I going to post about?   Oh, right.   So, hah... other things I do... I swear, I rush through life and it turns me into a clutz. I'm not normally a clumsy person. Or, well, I don't consider myself clumsy. My best friend- she's clumsy. If there is a glass of water near her, it WILL be knocked over. Her boyfriend and I have learned to move everything out of her reach- similar to what people do with toddlers. SHE'S a clutz. Inevitably she'll set her eye-glasses on the floor, and step on them. She'll cut herself while trying to trip her nails... she'll poke her eye out while plucking her brows...   Dammit. I'm rambling.   Anyway, I'M not like that. My clumsiness has to do with walking. Walking into things. Tripping over nothing. Running into people.   Just last week, there was a customer looking at some stuff on a display (I work at Best Buy, remember), and I went up to do my greeting... "Hi!!!... oh my gooooooood oh god oh goooaahhhh" how did I manage to run into the goddamn display? I wasn't RUNNING, I wasn't blind... I was walking normally... and I crash into a fucking display. I blush, I start sweating, and I chuckle... they act as if nothing happened... totally ignoring my little girly pleads for gods mercy as I was tumbling through a Best Buy display... "Do you have Tetris?" they ask.   Also, at work... I'm walking towards a co-worker... he's about 20 feet away, facing me... and I trip. I trip over the floor. I plummet 20 feet and crash right into Ole Boy. I knocked both of us down.   Walking my dog... he sees a squirrel. He takes off running towards said squirrel. Normal people would let go of the leash, knowing their dog is good, and will come back when called. Not me. I hold on for dear life, and get dragged across the courtyard on my ass for a good 100 feet... I still have bruises and grass stains to prove it. I yelled at the dog, too. I don't think he understood.   Oh, it's my birthday!   The End.

      (as a side note, Christy... these stories may annoy you since I slightly modify them, and I know you know that.  Oh well, ignore it, read)   ***  My dad grew up in Detroit. His family was poor, mainly due to the fact that they were Catholic, which meant there were a lot of kids (10), and only one income (my Grandpa worked for Ford). They lived in a small two bedroom house just outside of the city, I'd say it's about 800 square feet. It didn't have an indoor bathroom until my dad was about 7... they were the last family in the neighborhood to have a toilet installed.   My aunt Tiny used to tell me stories about how much she hated waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom. She'd lay in the bedroom that she shared with her 4 sisters, and try to distract herself from having to pee. Eventually Tiny would get up, put her robe on, slide into some slippers, and make a mad dash for the outhouse. Imagine how fun that would be on a cold Michigan night, eh?   Eventually everyone except Tiny moved out, got married or got killed- my uncle Tommy was stabbed one night while out on the town with his friends, the man who did it is now out of prison and presumably content with his life, unfortunatly my family will forever been ensnared by the horror of Tommy's death. I guess we all have one tragedy in our families, don't we...?   ***   Every weekend the whole family would go back to the house in Detroit to visit. By the time I came around (being the youngest child of the youngest child) the family was huge. I had 15 aunts and uncles, 40 some cousins, two parents, one sister, and two grandparents, and a gaggle of people that were somehow related, but no-one knew how. The women would cram themselves into the cramped kitchen, and prepare dinner. The men would gather in the garage to drink Coors and talk about cars. Us kids all kept busy "staying out of trouble".   Even at this point, Tiny lived there. She never married, never moved out, worked retail her whole life. I never saw her with a man, or a friend, even. She went to church every Sunday with my grandparents, went to work at Rite-Aid every day they had her on the schedule, and read. That's all she did. She didn't have a lot of money, nor did my grandparents... yet every christmas she bought all of us presents. Lots of them.   Granted, they were things like itchy sweaters with Rudolph embroidered on them, Jean Nate perfume, and leg warmers... but still... the memories of all of us squeezed into the living room, shoulder to shoulder, kids sitting on laps, dads standing behind moms... those memories are some of the fondest I have. All due to this one woman who went out of her way to find dirt-cheap merchandise in the clearence bins and bargin huts. She was generous beyond her means.   I loved spending the night at my grandparents house. All day I would lay around the back yard, reading my aunt Tiny's books... then I'd watch my grandpa sit in the kitchen, head humbly bowed, hands working his rosary. As soon as he was done he'd grumble something about ice cream, and I'd hop up to scoop us both a bowl. He wasn't the type of grandpa that took us fishing and had us sit on his knee to tell us stories about his youth... he was too old and too German for that. He was the type to sit around drinking and smoking, grunting at the TV. For some reason that's why I loved eating ice cream with him... it made me feel special.   Then I'd find my grandma and ask her to tell me about when she used to work in the bar... or about how they came down to Detroit before roads were built, "We had to stay along the shore..." her story would always start.   Finally, I'd go to my aunts room, and crawl into bed with her and her Evil Chihuahua. We'd both prop our books open and read. I'd constantly look over at her to see how she was sitting, and then re-position myself to mirror her position and facial expression. She'd let me borrow any book I wanted, she'd let me read for hours without telling me, "It's bedtime!".   It didn't occur to me until later in life that this amazing woman was never married. How could a woman who was so generous and intelligent and funny never find a man?   She's almost 60 now, and I asked her a few months ago if she'd ever had a boyfriend. She guffawed, and waved her hand at me... she put a cigarette between her lips and lit it.   "Corinne... I'm too stubborn for any damn man." she said as she was exhaling, the smoke rolled out of her mouth and nose, and hung in the air between us.   "But, you never had a boyfriend?" I prodded.   "Sure I did, when I was younger... but nothing serious." She took another puff.   "But, didn't you want a family and kids?" This woman is better with children than ANYONE I've ever met. She always talked to us like we were adults... she showed us respect, kept us in line, told us exactly how to tell a good joke, and taught us what it was to be a Good Person. She would have been a wonderful mother.   "Corinne, I had all of you guys... I had more kids than anyone... more than 40 of you. You are my children. You are all the family I could ever need. I didn't need the trouble of a husband when I could have a family without one." She smashed her cigarette out in the glass ashtray, obviously uncomfortable at having to say something remotely sentimental. "It goes without saying, Corinne." She stood at the sink, hands busy with the dirty dishes. "Men aren't worth the trouble. Look at what you went through... your sister... your mother. Even my own brothers are more of a pain then their wives should have to put up with! If you can find a good man, fine. But it's not nearly as important as everyone thinks it is."   She's an amazing woman, and the wisdom in this is simple. One can have everything they need out of life without having a constant companion. There is no need to leave the security of a parent and in turn search constantly for the security of a lover.   It's an extraordinary person that finds strength in solitude.

      oh, it's unofficially offical!  I did get promoted!  My boss just called me and told me that HIS boss told him to start looking for a replacement for me, since I'm going to Media.  Yay freakin' yay.

      I might get a promotion at work soon.  The supervisor of the Media department (cds/dvds/gaming) is leaving, and the sales manager said that I was the only person in the store qualified to take the position.  If I get that, I'll get a 30% raise... that'll be bad ass.    ***  I was thinking today about being young.  Remember how it was before you could drive?  You would have to beg someone for a ride to your friends house?  Then you'd end up staying the night because it was easier to do that then it was to find a ride home?  The only way friends stay the night when you get older is if they are triz-ashed.   I mean, can you just imagine?  Your friend comes over to watch a movie or have dinner... then they just STAY the night?  It wouldn't happen!  "Hey Corinne... is it cool if I just stay here tonight?"  "Why?"  "Oh, I dunno?  Is it okay?"  "But WHY?"  "So we can sit up and talk?"  "Well, can I call you?  I'll talk to you on your way home?"  I have no clue why the hell I was thinking about that.  ***  I'm trying to transition into talking about something else, but I'm stuck on that.  I wouldn't even MIND if someone stayed the night, but I don't think I'd *let* them, simply because it's a weird thing.  Like, even if a good friend (say... Leena) wanted to stay... I'd question the hell out of her about WHY she wanted to stay.  I mean, if I wouldn't MIND it, why would I have to give her the third degree before I'd consent?  Why can't I just say, "Yeah, that's cool".  Because it's weird.  And no, nothing happened to make me think of this, I just did.  I was driving home from my parents today, and thought this.  I seem to think about a lot of weird things on the way home from their house.  ***  Um, I think that's all I have to say?  Oh, I went and watched Austin play T-ball again.  It kinda makes me want to have kids... you know, teach them "life lessons", dress them in cute clothes... parade them around my friends... it makes me want a husband and a family.  At this point I honestly don't think I'll ever have any of that.  Not that it's a big deal if I don't... I think I'm like my Aunt Tiny... destined to be single forever.  WHY?  Because I'm too damn stubborn and choosy!    I have this idea of the perfect man in my head: He likes reading. He likes dogs. He's creative, or at least recognizes good art, even if he can't produce it. He must be funny. He has to be smart.  Looks are less important, but I love making lists, so... ideally, he would: Be about my age... not too old that I can't hang out with him and my friends, not too young that he acts like a kid. Height- between 5'9" and 6'4" Build- normal, maybe a little muscular, maybe a little skinny...  He can't freak out when I over-analyze things.  He can't be wimpy.  He can't be close minded...  And, you know... he could be perfect, but I will find something wrong with him.  I'll find SOME reason as to why I can't date him.  I loved Chris.  I dated him back when I was 18... and when we broke up (three years later), I still loved him, but damn... we weren't compatible.  Had we got married (like I wanted to), I would have been miserable.  He would have always been out in the garage working on cars, I would have turned into some white-trash mom... that would have sucked.  I don't even know if I loved Midu.  It's weird to have been married to someone that I don't think I loved.  I mean, he provided security and all that... and he was funny... and he gave me everything I ever wanted... but, love?  I really don't think so.  The whole time I was with him it was like I was single, but off the "market".  He worked 80+ hours a week... I sat home all the time, putzing around online.  I was alone the entire time I was married.  I'm just too set in my ways (already?!) to see myself with anyone.  Falling in love seems like an abstract thought.  SURE, in theory it sounds interesting... but I can't really FEEL it.  I'm not sure I will again.

      I'm not allowed to drive the boat.  Well, that's wrong.  I'm allowed to drive the boat as long as there aren't many other boats or jet skiiers on the lake, and as long as my dad is on the boat, and as long as he stands next to me.  The reason this doesn't bother me is because I can't parallel park a boat.  I can probably parallel park a car better than my dad, thanks to living in the city... but the boat is a different story.  I can accept the fact that I'm not trusted with the boat.  I think Jami is allowed to take out their boat, but I suppose that's besides the point.  I want to use this time to talk about cars.  When I first got my licence, I was a hellian.  Not just in regards to driving and cars... but with everything.  I was a pain in the ass, I'm well aware.  My poor parents, right?  (what doesn't kill you helps you grow, remember that, mom).  My first car caught on fire.  It wasn't my fault.  Laurie and I skipped school, and went to Taco Bell.  When we got home, the car caught fire.  It was a big dramatic ordeal... but, I'll have you know- I had that car for 6 months, and it didn't have a scratch on it!!  Then I was allowed to use my parents Tempo.  Yes, every few weeks a new random dent appeared.  I honestly don't know where these dents came from... none of them happened while I was in or near the car.    I was always caught off gaurd when my dad came storming into the house, ranting about my lack of respect, and the like... Pulling me outside to point at a new dent.  I probably shouldn't have gotten into the habit of leaving the car parked at random places while I hung out with friends... but still... No Accidents!  *** I saved up money, and bought a truck.  A Purple Ranger.  No Accidents.  (and my car payment was only $160 a month!!)  Then I got my cougar.  Three accidents.  This was a total fluke.  Stupid red cars.  I was rear-ended twice, and someone t-boned me (kinda) once... of the three accidents, none were my fault, or avoidable.  I had a gold ranger for a bit... No Accidents.  Now I have a Golf... No Accidents. ***  If I ever happen to be visiting my parents, and I have somewhere to go, I always ask to take my dads car.  Every single time the conversation goes like this:  "Dad, can I use your car to run up to the gas station?" "NO!" "Dad, come on!  It's just around the corner, I'm a good driver!" "NO!" "Daaaad!  Please, you never let me drive your car... Christy gets to." "NO! SHUT UP!"  *** I can manuver a Taurus out of a tiny, overpacked lot in Ann Arbor, fully in reverse.  I can parallel park on a main street, without pissing off the people behind me.  I've never had a speeding ticket.  All this, and I drive for at least an hour each day... both in city and on the highway.  YET I'm not allowed to drive my dads car.

      Xander was sick all day Sunday.  It's the first time he's been sick in two years!  I was worried to the point of leaving work early... then on the way home I got stuck in traffic... I was nearly in panic mode.  I was having sympathy stomach pains the whole day, and I thought "am I seriously sick just because my dog is?  No... No... I am really sick!" but, no, as soon as Xander got better, I felt fine.  Okay, yeah, so I'm a little too attached to my dog.  Of course he's fine now... back to normal again.    I think he musta ate a lot of cat poop or something.

      I grew up in a rural area. We had two police cars, 80 people in each graduating class, lots of farmers, lots of white people... My parents were city folk, but they moved out to the country when my sister and I were young, because they didn't want us growing up in Detroit.   Our favorite thing to do was play at the farm. It was about half a mile down the road, and "to be safe" we'd walk through the corn-field to get there, opposed to walking along the busy highway. When they were plowing the corn (or whatever its called.. harvesting?) we'd just take care to avoid the tractor. Sure, we'd hear stories on the news about the dangers of corn-fields and how easy it is to lose your sense of direction, and how many farmers inadvertently plow up kids or pets... but, hey, we were CAREFUL!   When we got to the farm, the first thing we did was climb up into the hay loft and look for kittens. We'd scamper over the wobbly bales of hay, careful not to smoosh any new kittens. Once in a while the stacks would shift, and we'd get a leg stuck between bales. We made a rule that we couldn't ever climb alone, we often used each other to pull ourselves free. I hate to admit it, but one time we found a mom cat feeding her kittens, and we thought "What does cat milk taste like?"... well, thank god we couldn't get the milk out.   After playing in the hay, we'd rush down to the cow-pen. Without hesitation, we'd swing our legs over the fence, and plop down in the pen... our feet and and ankles would be covered with poo, which we didn't mind, since we thought it was just mud. We'd push our way through the cows, which all seemed to collect near us. Once in a while they'd be humping, but we would just point and say, "Lookit that one, he must like us, he's trying to climb closer!!".   Then it was time for the pigs. We usually waited until feed-time, and we'd follow the farmer around, watching him fill the troughs with a sweet-smelling goo. The pigs would snortle and push each other around, but we didn't like the pigs much. They stank and had wiry hair. Once a month or so the farmer would take us into the pig-nursery. We'd get to see the huge fat momma pigs laying with their babies. There was always a pile of dead piglets by the door... the moms had a nasty habit of laying on their babies. We yelled at the moms, but things never seemed to change. They stank.   All of that seems fine and dandy, right?   I can say that my love and compassion for animals probably does have a connection with my summers spent at the farm... also, that's where my claustrophobia comes from.   Why?   My sister found a hole in the wall of the pig barn. She pried the metal plate up, and we poked our heads in. The silo! It was huge, and almost empty... the corn was just below the hole... maybe 1/10th full? "hello!!!" we called, to hear our voices bounce around, and come back to us. Christy was always the fearless one, and before I knew what was going on, she had squeezed through the hole, and laid in the middle of the pile of corn.   "Corinne, get in here!!". It just didn't seem right. "GOD, you're such a big baby, argh, I shoulda brought Becky, she is WAY more fun than you!!". Alright, that means I had to go in. I squeezed myself through the hole that was barely big enough to fit my small 7 year old frame. The second I got inside, I knew I had to get out. Christy was throwing corn around, her feet sinking in to the corn... she'd pull them up, kick corn, let them sink in again...   I tried to climb back out, but she grabbed me by the ankles. I kicked, she bit me in the shin, I kicked again, and she pushed me out. It didn't take her long to follow me, we could hear some machinery outside, and we wanted to go see what the farmer was doing.   Oh, he was getting ready to fill the silo with corn. Fancy that.   My nephews are just a little younger than we were when we did this stuff... I can barely stand to let them play in the BACK YARD without watching them... let alone play on a FARM.   Are they going to be big wimps, since they aren't allowed the same freedom I had when I was younger? Or will we just be raising the likelihood of them living a full life?

      I went to see Austins T-ball game today.  Those little kids are so freakin' cute.  Austin hits a ball better than I could.  Before the game we were hanging out at my parents, the boys were riding their motorized vehicles around, being cute.  My mom said that I need to come around them more, "They don't know their Aunt Corinne".  Yes they do.  And it's not easy for me to come out there, it's 45 minutes away, and I work weekends.

      Argh, I think I waited one day too long to take my Zoloft.  I was on the verge of tears when I was driving home from my parents house today.  No reason whatsoever... I just had that, "I'm so miserable" feeling.  GOD that sucks.  I haven't really had mood-swings since January (when I started taking medication for it), so I was totally unprepared for it when it got to me today.  I shoulda known it was coming, yesterday at work everyone was commenting on me being snappy... I yelled at one guy... literally YELLED because I was mad at him for "talking shit about me".  I mean, yeah, he was talking shit, but... god, it wasn't worth YELLING over.  Then I yelled at one of the security guys for paging me to my department... I was already IN my department, but since I'm short, he couldn't see me over the display, and he paged me, and I was pissed.  (because I don't want the managers to think I was out of my department).  Julian told me I was like Van Helsings wife.  He said, "From a distance she seems really sweet and nice... and then up close it's like the devil!".  Well thanks a fuckin' lot.  It didn't offend me at all, cuz I know Julian and I are cool, and I know he thinks I'm funny more than anything... but, I shoulda known my PMS was sneaking up on me.

      What the hell?  Blogger changed their interface.  I saw on Christys blog that my mom read it.  I hope she doesn't find mine.  I don't want to make her ears smoke with all my swearing.  How about I just put a disclaimer in right now?   Mom: Don't read this, you'll get mad.  ***  Okay, now that I've got that out of the way.  ***  I've been running 6 days a week for the past month and a half.  I can tell a difference already.  I'm in better shape now than I've been in my entire life.  After I quit smoking, I was SURE I'd pork up, but I didn't... mainly because I'm running, and also because I'm not eating fast food, and I'm really putting effort into NOT buying junk food.  If there is junk in the house, I WILL eat it.  I have no self control.  Christy used to make fun of me when I was little because I could easily eat an entire box of Little Debbies in one day.  Meghann made me cup-cakes for my birthday, and I ate them all within two days.  So, if you ever plan on coming to my house, be prepared: I have NO food.      Work is awesome these days.  Just a few weeks ago I was going to quit... I'm so glad I didn't.  I am not in charge of my own department, granted, I'm not officially a supervisor, but I was told by the sales manager that it's my dept., the supervisor won't be scheduled to work in it, and I am resonsible for the numbers and the employees.  It's SO gratifying to be in charge...!  I don't even need a raise, just the fact that I'm a "supervisor" makes me happy.  The General Manager also has me helping him with some of Best Buys inititives... I don't think I'm "allowed" to talk about them, since they are internal BBY changes, but it's a BIG deal, and out of the 120 people in the store, he decided that I was the best equipped to help him.  I'm starting to feel like I'll be promoted soon... I'm definatly being deveoloped, which is super-cool.

      I often find myself trying not to smile as I walk from my car to the front door of Best Buy in the morning.  There's really no reason as to why I have this conflict almost every day.  My mouth is starting to smile, then my brain says, "Corinne, dammit, what are you so happy about you freakin' dork...?  Don't smile.".    The security guy comes and slides the door open, "hey" I say... letting myself smile a little, out of politeness.  "What's up, Sunshine" or something of the sort is always said.  No matter who opens the door, or the mood I'm in, they say this.  They are being sarcastic, too.  I have the reputation for not being a "morning person".  Damn right I'm not.  (if they only knew I had to force myself to be rough and stuff with my... whatever, anyway...)  "HOLA! Como Estas!" says the cleaning guy, a huge smile plastered across his face, exposing his rotten teeth.  "Hola, Guido... muy bien... y tu?" I say.  I must make note here that I am the ONLY person that talks to the cleaning crew.  The only time I talked to any of them for any length of time was one Guido needed a cell phone.  My highschool spanish leaves much to be desired when it comes to explaining how the system of Credit Checks and Deposits go.    On this particular morning, my manager comes up to me, also brandishing a huge smile.  He's up to something.  I frown and try to think.  What's he so freakin' happy about?  "Eh... Morning, Corinne", he says.  The overhead lights are only on half power, but just bright enough to add an evil glint to Steves eye.  I continue to frown.    "What?", I say.  Guido pushes the floor polisher between Steve and I, giving me some time to compose myself.  I try to remember anything I could have done wrong in the past few days... I hurriedly think of any customers I may have pissed off... my mind fumbles over projects I may have forgot to finish...    Nothin'... of course, I can't think of anything.  I'm perfect.  He hands me  a stack of photos.  Cars.  Pictures of cars?  What?  I look from the cars back up to Steves glinty eyes.  I repeat myself.  "What?"  He laughs, and pulls the Industrial Strength Saran wrap from behind the counter.  "When we're in our meeting today, I want you to saran wrap those cars!".  Now, we all love Steve.  He's a good manager, funny, compassionate, helpful, etc etc etc... but... What?  Is he asking me to saran wrap CARS?  Normally I'd say I'd do anything for this man... but... what?  Oh shit, it's April 1st, isn't it.  Well, not today, but, the day that this is all happening, it was.  Since I'm the honorary loud-mouth-jackass at our store, I guess he figured I'd be the perfect person to pull off the Job.  Oh, was I EVER.    Was. I. Ever.  I wait patiently for the day to progress.  Steve and I share conspiring looks.  I'm spazzing to the point of explosion.  I'm so freakin' excited.  Why?  I know I know... Saran Wrapping cars isn't that exciting, blah blah blah shutthehell up and just listen to my story, asswads.  The meeting starts.  It's time to jam, baby.  I hurry outside, throwing away the Car Pictures on the way out the door.  I don't need them.  Steves Jeep is parked out in the very far lot.  It's his baby.  That baby got wrapped.  Ha, silly managers thinking I'm going to conspire with him against my lowly co-workers... not likely.  I was a double-agent.    A Double Saran Wrap Agent.  I took a picture of my masterpiece with my phone, added the caption, "Ha ha SUCKER", punched in Steves number, and hit send.  Man was I proud.  I was smiling with abandon, giggling, blabbing to everyone how I double-crossed Steve.  He came out of the meeting, phone in hand, walked right over to me and gave me a noogie... oh no, anything but THAT!  My mistake.  I can never win, I swear.  I got out of work at 4.  I got halfway to my car, and I noticed something was amiss.  I got closer, and noticed the lump of saran wrap on my roof.  Ohhhhh... big deal...  That's his revenge?  Bah, revenge!  Then I saw the goo on my windows.  What is that, Vasoline?  With shreds of paper mixed in?  Are those... bananas... in... my... tailpipe?  Looks like he put a lot of work into this!  I laughed, took pictures, and went to hop in.    MotherFucker... Vasoline under the doorhandles.  Looks like the work of a Pro.  I wipe my hand on my khakis, and drive over to the Install Bay to use their hose.  It took me over two hours to get most of the shit off my windshield.  The next day I wanted to take my dog to the park.  Opened the back door to usher him in.  Motherfucker.  Vasoline under the doorhandles.  A few days later, I go to get pizza.  Opened the door to put it on the passenger seat... yep... that doorhandle was violated, too.  Needless to say, I spent a good week getting pissed off every time I opened a car door.  No, I didn't wipe them off because I kept getting pissed off, getting in my car, getting more vasoline everywhere, trying to wipe it off my phone/dash/keys/steering-wheel... I'd just FORGET about the doorhandles.  (I never said I was a logical person, did I?)  To this day I still have vasoline under 2 doorhandles.  I still have it all over my rear-window.  I still have smears of it on my dash.  One day I'll learn my lesson and stop thinking I can fuck with people...

      I wanted to do some research on homosexuality and evolution.  I read somewhere that homosexuality was a form of population control.  When too many people start popping out, some of them are gay, in order to decrease the rate of production of said species.  Well, the obvious problem with this is that evolution is based on reproduction.  And if homosexuality is genetic, then only homosexuals would be able to pass on their gay-gene... and since there aren't many gay people reproducing, there wouldn't be a consistantly level  percentage (3%-10% of most populations, across the board, regardless of culture/social/economic status) of homosexuality present.  It would eventually peter out (no pun intended).  Then some more research showed me that some certian species of monkey tends to be active at night.  There is a small percentage of the population that has a diviant gene... these monkeys stay up durring the DAY.  The day time monkeys have the disadvantage of having a harder time finding food, since these monkeys eat night-snacks (I'm assuming some sort of bugs?  I didn't read up enough on this, and I don't plan on it, so, yes bugs.).  The day-monkeys help the entire species by being look-outs... sounding off alarms when danger is near.   So are homosexuals around to help us, as a whole, with something?  Are they fullfilling a social function, besides showing us  urlLink how to decorate ?

      I found this  urlLink journal  from a woman born in the early 1900's.  It's pretty interesting to hear real stories from the past.  I remember my grandma talking a little bit about her life, but I was so young that I didn't really have the interest I have now... it was interesting to hear, but I didn't understand the full scope of what she had lived through.  I'd really like to read more stories from the past...  email  me if you find anything online that you think is interesting.  ***  I'm going to go to Detroit soon.  I keep waiting to find someone to go with me to DIA... and nobody ever can, since my schedule is so messed up.  I seem to forget that I CAN do things on my own.  I don't need a friend or boyfriend to go with me!  I can go by myself.  I think I forget that I'm an adult sometimes.  ***  It's so easy to get stuck in your comfort zone.  Today I took Xander on a walk in the woods behind my place.  We always stay on the trail (which is pretty overgrown all of a sudden... those plants grew FAST!).  Then today I felt "adventurous"... we just started walking through the woods- off trail.    Granted, it's NOT a big deal to wander off the trail- it's not scary or dangerous... so, why hadn't I done it before?  It's so easy to just follow the rules in life, doing what is expected... yet we miss so much by not thinking through what we do.

      I found an awesome website that has  urlLink photo tours of Detroit .  The best tour is the  urlLink  Cadillac Hotel tour.        The easiest way to navigate that site is through the  urlLink  table of contents , which are somewhat hidden away...  The Asylum and Michigan Centeral tours are nice.    Leena and I are going to print out the map he provides, and go check all those sites out.  We might bring some big tough man along with us for saftey.

      This new promotion at work is quite weird.  I'm no longer "selling", I basically just walk around going, "Hey, how ya doin'?  Is there something I can help you find?".  On one hand it's comfortable and easy, but on the other hand I feel guilty, like I should be doing MORE.  I wanted to go to the post office yesterday and mail Tom a CD, but noooooo it's Ronald Regan day!  Thanks for the warning.  Stupid waste of a trip.  This zoloft is making me tired, I think.  I sleep a LOT.  Usually 12 hours a night, plus if I can fit a nap in, I will.  I'm going back to the doctor on Tuesday, maybe I'll try something else?  At first it made my hair fall out, but I started taking Centrum Silver, and that stopped the hairloss, I'm not sure why, but it worked.  Thank God.  I haven't ran in about two weeks, I've been working a lot, and just busy in general... so yesterday I ran again.  Yay.  I've also been smoking when I'm out.  I have to stop doing that.  I can already feel like I want to smoke right now, and smoking is GROSS.

      I'm tired- so I go to bed.  First I set my alarm- double check- triple check- yep... okay... I turn on the nightstand lamp, and turn off the halogen.  I pick up Atlas Shrugged, and read... oh... one paragraph.  Then I put the book back on my nightstand, and go to sleep.  ***  Or  ***  I get in the bath- a beer, my cell phone, and Atlas Shrugged all sit on the toliet lid.  I sip my beer and read about three pages of the book.  Then my phone rings- and I spend the rest of my bath yabbering away.  ************  I'm NEVER going to finish this book.  I love it.  I truly love it.  I love how it's written, I love what she's trying to express.  I love that she's explaining her philosophies via fiction.  Even if you don't agree with the points she's trying to make- at least you can enjoy the characters.  I believe this book is changing my life.  Probably not in the way Ayn Rand expected it would, though.  She writes about society and great minds.  People who are sucessful are punished for their vision and ability.  People like Bill Gates are  seen as Evil Monopolizing men- but is it WRONG that he has the intelect and ability to create and market his product in a very sucessful way?  Should he be punished for having a great idea, and having the ablity to carry it out?  Is Best Buy terrible for wanting to make a profit?  Is it a shame to be rich?  To be sucsessful?  My feet itch.  These antidisestablishmenism (err?) ideas are fantastic, they make sense, and I'm learning a lot.  BUT- her main charecter- Dagny Taggart- this woman is amazing.  She's amazing for many reasons... her intelligence, her ability, her beauty... The thing I admire most about Dagny is her love life.  In the begining of the book she is a strong woman and she loves her childhood friend.  This friend dumps her with no explanation (go figure, this has happend to me THREE TIMES).  She is single for a long time, and then she falls into the arms of a married man.  This man is amazing, and they seem perfect for each other... of course the fact that he's married is quite a problem- but regardless.  I was relieved to see that she didn't have to settle for just ANY man- she wouldn't have even considered it!  She is the type of woman who knows she deserves the best.  Then, later (varrious plot-spoling things happen, so I won't go into details), she falls in love with another man.  The Most Amazing Man Ever.  There is the potential for conflict.  Her first love has explained his reason for leaving (this, being 15 years later), and he wants to be with Dagny.  She still loves him.  Then she has the Married Man who she still loves.  And then The Most Amazing Man Ever who she is falling in love with.    Yet she isn't confused or guilty or anything.  Whatever happens- happens.  Any of these men are wonderful and she would enjoy being with them forever... and she just lets nature take its course.  (well- so far.  who knows what will happen in the last third of the book...)  ****  So ahh... why does that matter so much?  Because I tend to always try to control situations.  I push for things to happen.  It's hard for me to be patient with anyone.  I judge every situation right away, and make hasty decisions. If I knew a guy liked me, I'd find myself liking him back- ONLY because I knew he liked me.  What's THAT CRAP?  Why would a mans interest in me have ANY bearing on my interest in HIM?  If I like a guy for qualities he possesses or attitudes he portrays or WHATEVER it is that I like- it is not dependant on him liking me back.   That is an insecurity.  I will no longer seek to validate myself through my relationships.  Now- I have changed.  It wasn't consious, but it happened.  I'm sure there are many things that come into play, but... this is how it goes.  **** BEFORE ****  I'd go to a party/the bar/work/wherever and be constantly aware of who was there, and who seemed to be interested in me, and who seemed to be flirting with me.  If a guy was flirting, I'd focus on making something happen.  I'd flirt back so he knew he could ask for my number... that type of thing.  I wouldn't even enjoy myself- I'd be focused on PROVING myself to this guy who I latched on to.  Then I'd end up dating him, only to find out that I really didn't like him.  He'd be stupid, or a pot head, or a conservative, or too religious, disrespectful to his parents... whatever... little things he did would annoy me.  I'd dump him.  Usually not in a nice way.  Then I'd start over again.  Party anyone?  ******** NOW ********  I go to a party.  Of course I scope the scene and see if there is anyone interesting around.  I find a good conversation or a fun crowd... I tell stories... I listen to people... I relax and enjoy myself.  Last night I went to a party- a few guys were drunk and trying to flirt... trying to get me to dance with them/sit by them/talk to them... and I was flattered, of course.  But never once did the thought of "Oh, I like this guy!  I'm going to give him my number!" enter my head.  I enjoyed the company and the conversation... and when I started to get tired I left.  BEFORE I would have been depressed- oh, I left and I didn't give anyone my number.  No dates set up.  No plans made. boo hoo.  God, how terrible.  I was so focused on controling everything that I didn't even pay ATTENTION to finding things that I enjoyed.  I didn't care about the guys before.  I didn't respect them.  I wasn't intrigued by them.  I was using them to make me feel secure.  Their interest showed that I was a desireable person.  I may be single for a long time.  I may always be single.  Who knows... but being single is better than being with someone I don't burn for- this I know.

      Wait till you all see Xanders new trick.  He can pick up the laundry for me, and put it in the laundry basket.     First I had to teach him "laundry".  He loves dirty socks, so I took a bunch of socks and said "laundry- get it".  After he figured out that the word "laundry" meant that I wanted him to pick up a sock, we were halfway to our goal.  The next thing we did was grab a laundry basket.  Every time he sniffed at the basket I would say "roundup!".  Then he started jumping on the bed.  Oops... he knows "up" means jump in bed- so we changed the command to "round".  Of course, both with the "laundry" command and the "round" command, he was reinforced with a lot of praise each time he excecuted the command.  Then all evening we've been working on "Laundry" "round!".  He's getting pretty good!  After he gets five socks in the basket we take a break.  The hard part is getting him to leave the socks IN the basket.  I can't wait until I just say "Laundry Round!" and he picks up my mess for me.  Oh, it WILL happen.

      I went to the police station today.  I had to file a report about my ring that the repo guys took.  I've lived in Ypsi for two years, and I've been to the police station at least five times.  I lived in Clinton my whole life and I don't think I EVER went inside that station.  There was a woman at the desk, sitting snuggly behind the bullet proof glass.  She told me I'd need to call the dispatcher from the phone on the end of the counter.  After telling the dispatcher about the problem, he told me to sit tight, and he'd send an officer over.  Seeing as how I'm the most impatient person on the planet, the twenty minutes I spent waiting seemed like an eternity.  My back was to the door- but I heard it swoosh open.  "Corinne?"  I turned around.    Spark.  "Uh, hi..." he smiled, "What can I help you with?"  I smiled back, "I have to file a police report".  "Lets go find somewhere we can be alone" he said.  (haha, not really... haha, he actually just said "Okay, lets find an empty office, so we can talk")  There were two offices side by side.  He asked a guy at one of the desks if he could use the office.  The guy said, "Sure, but they are doing a polygraph in the next room, so keep it down you two".  I blushed.  He chuckled.  I started telling him the story, trying to be mindfull of how loud I was talking, as to not disturb the polygraph session in the next room.  Right away he told me that it was out of his jurisdiction, since the repo guys were in Toledo.  I expected us to get up and leave at that point.  But no.  He started giving me a quick rundown of how it'll work- what I could do.   We talked for about 10 minutes.  Joking about repo guys.    "So, is your divorce final?" he asked.  FUCK DAMN IT.  "Uh, no... it should be, but it's such a pain..."  He laughed... told me he just got his finalized last month.  "How do you spell your name again?" He sat poised with his pen above his notepad.  I spelled it out.  "And your birthdate?"  "four twenty eight seventy eight"  Why did he need my birthdate?    He gave me his card, and stuttured out, "Well, huh.. here's my card if you need anything, I'm not sure.. uh... well, just feel free to call if you need something."  Was he flirting?  Or friendly?  I'm going to call him.

      The waves crashed against the shore, releasing a salty breath into the air. To my left the rocky cliffs were surrounded with low hung clouds. Across the ocean the sky was dark, highlighted by the glowing streak of the horizon. The view made me think of eternity. It does not matter how often I visit the ocean, it always makes me melancholic, it makes me aware of my own mortality.   I stood with my feet in the water- waves lapping at my ankles. My dress was clinging to my legs and my hair was being whipped by the wind. I was forcing myself to take deep breaths to relieve the anxiety of my desperation.   My pain in facing my own mortality. My struggle with accepting the Human Condition. Try not to think of eternity.   I felt his presence before I saw him.   The clouds rose and blew off across the hillsides. The wind settled and the humidity lifted. The ocean retreated.   The depth of his eyes reflected the entire world back at me; past, present, future all working together to bring me to my knees. Although his physical presence was strong and demanding- it was his soul that made me submit. To be near him made me feel as if he were not only the God of The Sun, but the sun itself.   There I was, standing on the shores of Greece, before the son of Zeus.   He shot me with his arrow of insight and he conquered my unconscious terrors... he did this without knowing his powers.   Before I could absorb every ray of his presence, he was gone. He left me standing on the sand. No longer touched by the elements. No longer horrified by the future.   The ocean stayed calm, the clouds did not re-appear, and even the cliffs seemed to take on a less ominous stance.   He had brought the sun with him, and when he departed, he left it behind.

      When you google "hoobostank" my blog comes up in the first few searches.  Gah-reat.  People who are looking for a stank ass band might find my blog.  Hopefully people who like Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes, or even The Vines might find this.  I want to go see more live bands (christy and jason).  I went to a house party the other day... the girl works at 105.1, so there were a lot of "radio people" there.  They kept talking about bands and music, and I started feeling pissy about the fact that I never do anything fun.  All I ever do is go to the bar with work people, sit around Mike and Leenas, sit around Ramzis, or... sit home.  That's not so fun.  Things I want to do:  1). Go to the urlLink  DIA  2). Go see bands (I'm not really picky on who I see, I just want to see more) 3). Go to the zoo

      James knew nothing else besides farming. He was born and raised on a farm.  &nbsp; Every aspect of James personality and turn in his life was true to his farming heritage. He had strict ideals that matched up perfectly with others in his community. And then there was Caroline. She was a truly beautiful cow. Physically perfect- smooth hide, bright, shining eyes, perfect form. The first time he looked into her huge wet eyes, he felt as if he was finally at peace with the world. He found himself sneaking out to the barn just to gaze upon Caroline. It was almost as if she was devine.  &nbsp; Her movements were flowing, yet strong. She seemed to be perfect. James would sometimes fall asleep against the hay. It wasn't comfortable, physically, but emotionally Caroline seemed to affect him, even when he wasn't awake. It was as if he felt safe just to be near her.  &nbsp; This continued for quite some time. James began to feel insecure about his feelings for this cow.  &nbsp; "Real Farmers" would never become attached to a cow! A "real farmer" would know that cows are only good for one thing- Meat. It came to a point where he would start to fall asleep, and a single thought would nag at him. He'd surpress this thought, trying to sustain the happiness he felt with Caroline. He did not WANT anything to detract from this pure bliss he was experiencing.  &nbsp; Then one night the thoughts flooded in like a tidal wave. He could no longer deny reality for the sake of his own emotional wellbeing. He could not forget that he was a farmer, and Caroline was a cow- a typical cow. He had allowed himself to fall in love. Real Farmers do not fall in love. Cows are only good for one thing. After what seemed to be an eternity, he slept.  &nbsp; The next morning he woke, and quickly made his way to the phone. Without hesitating, he dialed the butcher. "I have one ready for you today, Dale." He said. "No... No... Just this one... she's giving me too much trouble. Yes, just take her today- I can't bare to deal with her any longer." Make no mistake, he was just like the other farmers.  &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Ahhh the pressure of updating.  I have anxiety that I can't get rid of.  I keep reminding myself to take deep breaths.  It's pms that's doing it to me.    Not what you want to read about?  Okay.  Xander has worms, I think.  Either that or he ate strings.  No?  Mmmm... I think I'm going to be single forever.  That's what I'm thinking about today.  I'm getting kinda depressed over it, but I dont know if I'm REALLY depressed or I just have PMS and that's making me feel depressed.  I don't really want to talk about all that on my blog though.  How about... um.   I got nothin'.

      At work we have  urlLink Rhapsody.   It's a digital music service that offers both downloads and streaming audio.  It's 9.99 a month for the streaming music (you can listen to whatever you want, whenever you want it) and .79 cents per download.  We use it at work for those customers who come in and say, "oh... I'm looking for that song... you know... um... a white guy sings it... something about "I'm sorry"... oh... kinda like Hoobostank sounding...".    First off I tell them "Hoobostank sounds like crap, but lets go ahead and try to look up this song of yours." (yes, yes, you can call my bluff on that).  Yesterday I thought to search for  urlLink Rivera , since I saw them play and I really liked them, etc...  I was 98% sure Rhapsody wouldn't have them on there, since they are not "big time" as of yet.  Well, Sure 'nuff... there they were!

      For whatever reason, I'm very interested in the differences between dialect through-out the US.  Like in Michigan we say "pop" instead of "soda".  Did you realize that "TPing" is a Michigan term?  Everyone else apparently says "Toliet Papering" and "rolling".  This  urlLink quiz  breaks down some of the more common differences between dialect.  It's interesting to see the things that we say that I assumed EVERYONE said.  Ra ra  ***  I got a new car today, seeing as how my last one got REPOED (stupid stupid ex).  A Focus Wagon.  It's pretty funky fresh.

      My laptop screen is BAD.  I got a 19" monitor from work for 100 bucks.  I didn't want to spend that money, but... well, damn.  So I have my laptop hooked up to this cheap/large monitor.  It's quite nice, actually!  The colors are all crisp and bright!  Even my blog page, I looked at it, and holy cow, it's different colored than I had thought.     Plus with photo-editing and such, this other monitor is MUCH better.  I can see much better.  better. much. yah yah  Up north was sucky for me.  Mainly because I had a cold the whole time, and it just made me super tired.  On the drive home I was more tired than I have ever been while driving in MY LIFE.  I was seriously considering stopping at a rest stop to nap.  I was so relieved when I got home.  ***  Tonight I was sitting playing on my computer all night (thanks in part to this magnificently huge monitor which makes computer play all the more fun!) (and, no I don't mean "play", I mean it in the innocent term).    Well, I heard this crashing noise coming from my patio.  I looked over and Xander was just fine, so I figured the cats were just getting into something.  Then I heard this RAAAR RAAAWWREEEERRR noise coming from outside.  What the hell?    Yes, that would be Ramses.  That damn cat KNOCKED THE SCREEN OFF THE TRACK in order to go fight the neighbor cat!!  Now how many cats do you know that can push through a screen door?  It's amazing!  So I run outside, yell, "HEY!"  Ramses comes trotting towards me, Evil Villian Neighbor Cat scurries away.  What am I gonna do about this?  I can't have the door open??

      I'm going to boston tomorrow.  Leaving at 6am.  Which means I have to be up and at-em by 400.  330 would be ideal.  Okay, this will be interesting.  I get home at 10 tonight, need to go to bed IMMEDIATELY... and I've been going to bed at 1.  How interesting will this be?  Very.  Per moms advice, I'm leaving my good camera at home, and buying a shitty one from target (disposable).

      I took Xander to the vet today for shots.  I mentioned that I used to work at VCA as a VA (veterinary assistant).  The vet said, "Oh as a tech?", and (not thinking) I said "Yeah".    Then he started asking about my job history, salary, etc... and I was like, "Oh, well, I was really just a VA- Walked the dogs, gave shots sometimes, you know... not really a tech".  I think he either didn't care, or wasn't listening.  He told me to drop my resume off, because he'd like to hire me part time.  Wow, that's cool.  I loved working at VCA.  I just wonder if my availiblity will be helpfull at all for them, since Best Buy takes up a lot of my time.  I told him, if anything, I could help with the animals they board.  Either way, it's cool.  And the bill was 200 bucks.  He gave me a free exam though, nice huh?  I mean, not nice, 200 bucks is a lot, but hell, it's better than 250.  Plus I might get some part time income coming in!

      I'm so sad.  The tops of my feet are covered in misquito bites.    It's not bareable.  It's 6 am, and I'm awake because my feet itch.  I tried to stay in bed, but I was close to tears over the frustration of wanting to itch, trying not to itch, itching, and it not helping.  So I am up, Hydrocortisone in hand- (or- on foot, actually).  This is a terrible situation.
