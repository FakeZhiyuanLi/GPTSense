						   I just finished filling out my entry form for the Fall Festival.&nbsp; I must admit, I'm slightly terrified!&nbsp; I haven't shown a horse in over 4 years!!&nbsp; I know I just need to get back into the ring, and that once we get going everything will be fine.&nbsp; However, until then I will live in fear.&nbsp; It is difficult for me to comprehend, that after all the showing I have done in the past, I can be this worried now.&nbsp;Perhaps it is because I have no trainer.&nbsp; Perhaps it is because I haven't bothered to ride a test yet. Perhaps it is because I feel too fat to be in the ring being judged.&nbsp;   Regardless, I am going!&nbsp; I will show first level and hopefully win at least one class.&nbsp; I hope I can remember how to braid...I hope I can remember all the stupid little shit needed to show a horse...I hope Dobby's shoes stay on for the entire weekend...Okay, I'm going to go breath into a paper bag now...

						   Hi, Margo..Since i am blogtarded still I am responding directly. I have the World Cup on my calendar and plan to go. It was a blast when we went to the Show Jumping championships in 2003. A bunch of the H/J folks will undoubtedly go, too. I felt like I was a groupie at a rock concert some of the time. I was sitting near Will Simpson once....of Hidden Creek farms (I think). Then Ludger Beerbaum, Norman della Joio, and a bunch of other guys were signing autographs in the vendor area (which was of course quite nice...Hermes saddles anyone?) And of course there was Rodrigo Pessoa who practically got a standing ovation every time he came in the ring. It was fun to see all the great riders and horses and to be at an equestrian event where there was actually a big well informed audience that cheered and had a great time, especially on Sunday for the actual World Cup final. Omaha's own Karen Cudmore (who rides for Canada) placed 20th out of 40 some. Not bad for the best riders in the world. Debbie MacDonald did her freestyle on Sunday between the two rounds of the finals. Very cool. They had other Vegas type entertainment, too. Like the guy who jumped over a convertible standing with one foot each on the backs of two paints....I kid you not. They also had some of the German riders do a barrel racing competition on some little barrel racers...That was a hoot. I am rambling but can you tell, I had a great time. Even Hubby had fun. He kept score (how boylike) and really got into it. So I for sure am going again and Steve will probably want to, too. I know Cindy Berlin and some of her friends are hoping to go.

						   I was reading the USDF Connection last night, and saw that both World Cup Dressage and World Cup Jumping will be held in Las Vegas next April 20-24!!!&nbsp; 2 classy sports held in the trashiest town in America!!&nbsp; Sounds like its time for a vacation ladies.&nbsp; Tix for the events are pretty expensive, but there is a group rate for groups of 10 or more...check out the website for more info.&nbsp;  urlLink www.worldcupvegas.com &nbsp;  I've never seen "world class" competition first hand, so I would love to go.&nbsp; I think if we got a group together we could have a really great time tearin' up Vegas and watching dressage on an international stage.

						   Yesterday my mom stopped at the tack store and bought Dobby some new bell boots.&nbsp; Hoooray for mom!!!!&nbsp; Except that she was forced to by 2 green boots and 2 blue boots, as they were the only 2 pair of XL bell boots left in the store.&nbsp;   For most normal horse owners this would not be a problem "oh fun, 2 different colors."&nbsp; Not for Margo.&nbsp; I've been religious about sticking to Dobby's color scheme: Black, white, silver and grey.&nbsp;&nbsp;These green and blue bell boots are just a nightmare...much like our fly sheet which is white with navy trim...at least the boots will match the sheet.&nbsp; At least Dobby has bell boots he can wear all the time so he doesn't ruin his feet.&nbsp; (pardon me while I try to accept color).   It's just that I have this little dream about&nbsp; me and Dobby...everything matching (yes, this could also be called OCD) in varying shades of black, white and grey.&nbsp; None of his blankets match and now these misfit bell boots!!!&nbsp; Perhaps the dream of a full scale color scheme will have to be reserved for shows only.&nbsp; *sigh*&nbsp; Or perhaps I should seek some kind of medical treatment for my color focused OCD!   &nbsp;

						   Since I caught so much hell about this article.....here is the revision.... I love you guys, I really do!! :)     How to Care for Your Dressage Arena      by Jamee L. Amundson    Drag the arena daily or every other day, paying close attention to the high traffic areas on the rail.&nbsp; If the rail has a four foot trench, then please take a rake and pull dirt from the corners and wall to fill in the trench before dragging with a tractor.   When it comes to watering, please try to use a water, drag, water, drag practice so that the footing does not clump.&nbsp; By doing this, all portions of the footing are wet and watering will need to be done less often.&nbsp; Please do not flood the arena and then not drag it, as this creates mud and slick spots and not to mention hard crusty balls of sand.   Ok, I am finished.&nbsp; Sorry to bitch for a minute there ladies.&nbsp; I am just irritated that we pay for that&nbsp;indoor&nbsp;and it's crappy at times.&nbsp; Not to mention we can't ride in the outdoor arena because there is five feet of grass growing in it.&nbsp;I really&nbsp;hate to be one of&nbsp;"those&nbsp;boarders", but sometimes I am curious as to what my board is going towards........but I am finished now, I promise!

						   Thought you guys might be interested, considering the projected weather today and tomorrow:  &nbsp;  From University of Illinois Vet School:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Signs of heatstroke are unexpected fatigue, possibly stumbling, and an increased respiratory rate. Horses normally lose heat by sweating. When they are overheated, they pant in order to lose more heat. If the respiratory rate becomes higher than the heart rate, especially after resting for a few minutes, then the horse is overheated and needs help.&nbsp; When this occurs, cool the horse off immediately. Get it in shade. Offer some drinking water. Run as much cold water over the horse as you possibly can. Use a fan, if one is available, to help cool it off.  &nbsp;  There are a few myths concerning horses and heatstroke that need to be put to rest."Traditionally, we were taught not put a lot cold water on horses' backs and hindquarters,"says Dr. Foreman. However, exercising muscle can reach 110 degrees (F), at which point protein fibers start to denature or fall apart, and must be cooled off. "We've done it to over 500 horses in field settings and competitions leading up to and including the Olympics. We were slinging ice-cold water everywhere and had no horses tie up." One thing you should not do is leave wet towels draped over the horse's neck and head.&nbsp; Unless you keep pouring cold water over it, the towel will warm up and become an insulating blanket and retain heat.  &nbsp;  Another myth forbids a hot horse to drink water. "If they have normal to increased gastrointestinal sounds then let them drink, but not so much that their stomach can be distended, not bucketfuls," says Dr. Foreman. "In fact, the thirst drive to drink decreases with time after exercise." If you let them drink right away, they usually will. If you wait, even 5 to 10 minutes, they may not drink at all for a while even though they are dehydrated.  &nbsp;  Another myth is that trotting or cantering will cool horses off. The rider feels refreshed by moving through the air. However, horses produce more heat to create the breeze than they lose to it. The temperature of a trotting horse goes up, not down. You can prevent heatstroke by providing protection from the sun and by always having a salt block available. "People underestimate how much radiant heat is gained by standing in the sunshine. They think of it for themselves and wear a hat but they don't think of it for the horse," says Dr. Foreman. "Also, a salt block will provide electrolytes lost in sweat." A horse will sweat just standing in the pasture and will lose a lot of sodium and chloride and fair amount of potassium.  &nbsp;

						   Yesterday, after a scortching hot ride and a nice relaxing cool shower, I gave Dobby an extra special treat.&nbsp; He loved it so much, I thought I would share this no brainer special treat recipe with all&nbsp; y'all. &nbsp; I don't know the exact measurements, so you'll have to eyeball it. &nbsp; 1/3 cup or so Instant Oatmeal 1 1/2 Cups Wheat germ 1/2 Cup Dark Molasses 1 Tbsp warm water &nbsp; Dobby really enjoyed this mixture, he started eating it out of the bowl I'd mixed it in before I even got a chance to dump it in his feed.&nbsp;

						   I get an online Horse Newsletter called "The Horse" and it mainly deals with horse health issues, contagious diseases and new veterinary techniques, but it also has lots of current news.  One interesting thing came up today:  Two American Saddlebreds had to be euthanized last year because of a "brutal attack".  (The article was in there this week because they are trying to get one of the bodies exhumed for further testing and autopsy) Someone came in the barn and injected the left front pastern of five World Champion saddlebreds with a caustic, necrosing substance.  All five horses had large circular wounds on their front pasterns where the tissue had simply died from the injection, it then began to eat away at the internal tissues and two had to be euthanized because their other foot got so bad that they couldn't stand.  The other three horses had lengthy recoveries and are now back in training.  USEF offered a $10,0000 reward to find the jerks who did this. The barn manager said she walked into the barn on Monday morning and the left front legs of theses horses were severely swollen up to their shoulders.  Could you imagine??  Hopefully Voldemort (Darth Vader) won't see this and find a way to off all of our horses.....this is something he doesn't need to know about !!

						   Make way!  Clear a path, make room for the expanded egos of our former barn mates, and followers of Jenny.  If Jenny is the mesiah of Dressage, then Cindy Ishoy is surely the goddess most divine.  Recently Cindy Ishoy was named a member of this year's  urlLink Canadian Dressage Team.   Congratulations to her (even though she is a pompus blow hard).  I can't wait to run into one of the cult members, and hear all about their "Olyimpic" quality training methods.  Sheesh.

						   Those poor things.  This weather is miserable.  I spent 20 min. running cold water over Snr. Kranky Pants yesterday just so that his body temperature would drop.  I got up at 5 to ride this morning and it was already 80 degrees and felt like 90, so I thought "what's the point?" and just went back to bed.  Hopefully they will be outside today, I don't know how much rain we got last night.  To whomever is in charge of these things:  90 degrees is ok, but it doesn't have to be so freakin' humid!!

						   Ladies, I am a little concerned about my dedication to dressage....because it was supposed to be ungodly hot today, I was planning on getting up at 5 and riding before going into the office.  But when the alarm went off at 5, I just turned if off and went back to sleep.  What is the matter with me?  Now I have lost a day of riding.  I promise to go out and give him a shower this afternoon....but does that mean I have no dedication to my beloved and my sport?  Is there therapy out there for people like me?  Or is it just because it is Monday and the weather was miserable at 5 this morning?  Do I need help?? :)

						   There are 2 things in this world that really piss me off.  1) Stupid people 2) People who don't take care of their animals. I would like to say here and now that if you don't want to put the work into your animal, or if you aren't going to treat that animal with the respect every living thing deserves, you should not have that animal at all.  Poor poor Hercules (our visiting German Shepard) has to cross a dangerous road to seek out some love and entertainment.  I adore Herc, but find it quite sad that his owners obviously don't care enough about their beautiful dog to make sure he isn't crossing the highway.  I don't know about any one else, but if my dog were missing for several hours I would notice, and probably go into a panic.    I am sick and tired of awful people not treating animals well.  Having a pet or a horse is an honor. It is an understanding between species.  People who don't understand this concept should not be honored with the kind of loyalty and love an animal can give.

						   Ladies, the dressage portion of the NE State Games will take place this Sunday at the fair grounds.  Intro through 2nd level will be shown (supposedly) as well as musical freestyle.  I'm planning to check it out hopefully some of you will join me.  Perhaps the Games will inspire others among us to pack up their trunks and head off to the show grounds this August!

						   I think people should be measured in hands, just like horses.  As I watched Angie disappear behind Miss Margo's gynormous equine yesterday, I thought, you know, it would be so much easier for me if people were measured in hands.  My brain seems to be much more inclined to wrap itself around estimating the size of horses in hands than it does estimating the height of people in feet.  For example, I can walk into any barn, look at a horse and estimate, within a .1 of a hand, how tall that particular horse is, and be pretty darn close.  People on the other hand, not so much.  If people were measured in hands and I were mugged on a street in NYC, I would be much more effective at reporting the perpetrator to the police.  If I had to do it in feet, I think it would sound something like this; "Ummmm, I think he was between five foot and six foot, but I don't know".    So...in terms of my personal safety, and all the rest of the horse people out there, I think my drivers license should read 16.3HH under the height category.

						   CLEARLY, creating a musical freestyle to be performed in 60 days is a bit more difficult than I anticipated.  After spending last night working w/my dressage arena white board (which I ruined in the process), the USDF "requirements" and my chosen Cd, I am slightly concerned that I have bitten off more than I can chew.  As it turns out, all the cool moves I came up with don't necessarily blend as well together as I had anticipated. It also turns out that first level just isn't that interesting. So....what now?  I'm not going to give up, even though the really difficult work of putting all of this together has yet begun.  It is going to be a spectacle at the Fall Festival anyway...I might as well set it to music....can't be worse than all the other crappy Freestyles I've seen over the years.  So, if anyone has musical freestyle videos they would be willing to share PLEASE let me know.  Lord knows I need the inspiration.

						   It just doesn't feel like summer if I can't ride outside.  I am ready for the embarassing farmer's tan!  I am ready to swallow some bugs (which happens frequently if you ride w/your mouth open)! All I want to do is walk my horse out in the pasture, for the love! Stupid rain...ruining a perfectly lovely summer!

						   Because I have a NASCAR loving boyfriend, I have watched the  Dressage Today  and  Chronicle of the Horse  subscriptions make a new friend,  American Thunder .  My Sunday afternoons are now filled with watching the weekly NASCAR Nextel Cup race.  I have found myself getting into this seemingly redneck sport....and I wasn't quite sure why, until I watched the cars and drivers practice for the road course in Sonoma, California two weeks ago.  While watching this practice session on FX, I realized that NASCAR has some similarities to dressage!!    First off, all of the drivers are assigned to one car and one team that they work with, every single weekend.  Similar to how Grand Prix dressage riders typically only compete one horse at a time.  Some NASCAR drivers will be contracted to drive another car in the Busch Series, one "level" below the Cup race. We see this in the dressage ring as well.  The Grand Prix riders often have a younger, less experienced horse they will compete at lower levels.  Additionally, the drivers and teams take their cars to the race track before the actual race to "test".  This gives the driver the opportunity to learn the track and the team an opportunity to fine-tune the car and make adjustments to the engine so that come race day, they are more than ready.  I am pretty sure I do exactly the same thing when I practice my dressage test at home before a show.  I ride through all the movements, learn the test and then fine-tune the problem areas.  Like that tricky half-pass to flying change movement.  On race day, the drivers focus and put their game faces on.  Many of them have pre-race routines that they follow.  I have similar pre-show routines.  During the race, the drivers are allowed to have a spotter that is positioned high above the track and through radio communications with the driver, helps them pass other drivers on the track.  The spotter is responsible for alerting the driver if there is another car on the "high" side (right) or "low" side (left). The terms "high" and "low" feel all too familiar.....outside and insider rein?!?!? In my mind, the spotter is similar to the person reading my test.  At superspeedways, the tracks are so large that drivers often need more than one spotter.  Wouldn't it be nice to have two readers at the times when the wind is blowing 90 mph and you can't hear the one reader at B?  Throughout the race, the driver communicates with the crew chief about how the car feels.  The driver will report whether or not the car is loose or tight, or if it is pushing or pulling.  All of these terms refer to how the car is driving through the corner.  A loose car feels like it is out of control and will spin out in the corner.  A tight car is really hard to turn.  I know a tight horse is really hard to turn around an 8 m volte!  At pit stops, the crew chief will take those comments from the driver and make adjustments to the car.  They will add or remove spring rubbers to stop pushing and pulling or they will tighten and loosen the track bar to correct looseness or tightness.  To me, these symbolize all of the things I do in my warm-up to adjust how my horse "handles".  I might school a series of travers, renvers, travers to loosen up my horse's "track bar" and get a little better control over the hind legs.  For me, the profound discovery of the similarities was apparent while watching the cars take tight s-curves on a road course.  As these cars were switching directions and taking these curves, I realized that the crews had the cars set up so that they would almost sit through the turns.  The cars would crouch on their rear tires through the turns and lift their front ends off the ground.  It looked like a very classically trained horse doing a canter pirouette!  Interviews with the crew chiefs revealed that they manipulate the springs in the rear-end and aerodynamics so that they cars do that and they are faster.  Are you with me yet........?  Even the way the press talks about the drivers is similar to  Dressage Today's  commentary on our famous Olympic riders.  I recently read an interview discussing the surprising talents of a rookie driver.  The article said this rookie was so successful because he has a "natural feel of the car and its faults; and an amazing ability to tell his crew chief how to adjust the car".  I am certain I have read that sort of commentary on up-and-coming dressage riders.  "They just have a natural feel for the horse".  So next time you have finished schooling your wonderful steed on a Sunday morning, take the opportunity to watch a NASCAR Nextel Cup race....I promise you the similarities will be quite surprising.  I am not sure, however, that I have convinced myself that galloping around on a 1200 animal is more or less dangerous than driving a stock car at 195 mph.  The nice thing about sticking with dressage is that we get to go to the right and the left.....NASCAR drivers must go to the left every race.  It appears those NASCAR drivers need a little more left rein and a lecture about straightness between the seatbones.

						   Can I comment on riding attire for a few minutes?  I thought dressage was about history, sophistication, and tradition.  It is possible that I am wrong.  Our show attire, white breeches, black coat, crisp white shirt with stock tie, represents all three of those things....history, sophistication, and tradition.  When did sex appeal enter into our schooling attire?  I recently saw a young lady school her horse in some interesting attire.  She had the waistband of her breeches rolled down to her hips, and it was quite obvious there were no undergarments under those tight-fitting, tan breeches.  Here shirt was short-sleeved and equally short-waisted.  Her belly button ring was shining in the sun.  Her shirt was  tight-fitting and scoop-necked.  Her large, pontentially fake, chest area was well presented in this particular shirt.    My practical thinking mind would like to know what was gained by wearing this attire??  Perhaps it was to show off her slender figure in the saddle.  That's all well and good, but there wasn't anyone else watching.  It was her and the horse.  Furthermore, what would have happened if she were launched from her steed's back?  Her bare stomach was surely going to experience some serious lacerations and "road rash" from the abrasive arena sand.  I would really hate to have sand in my bra after skidding down the long side of the arena!  My biggest worry was the belly button ring.  Can you imagine the carnage if she were bucked off and her ring caught on the saddle or other tack item?   Perhaps I am being petty.  Or perhaps I am just a product of old school dressage training.  Maybe this young lady needs a German riding instructor yelling at her about her choice of schooling clothes.  I know that I was never yelled at for this particlur crime, but it was an unspoken rule that your breeches (typically of a dark color, some plaids and pleats as long as they were sophisicated)were worn with a leather belt and collared shirt to a clinic or when schooling.  Sleeveless shirts were ok, as long as it had a collar.    Evidently, I have missed the memo about sex appeal in the dressage ring.  First it was swallow-tailed dressage pads in the show ring (which I love, by the way), next it will be belly-cut dressage coats.  I guess I need to relax.....

						   As we all know, I am a single lady now, and up until last night the origins of my split from Jason were unknown.  As it turns out Dobby made the top 3 reasons Jason had to break it off.  1) We are too different 2)Empty Promises (mostly relating to me cleaning the house) 3) I spend too much time and too much $$ on my horse  Okay, I love the guy, and I know we are going to be friends, but man if you can't love my horse, you can't love me.  Done dealin'!  I felt like I got my life back when I bought Dobby, but apparently Jason was threatened.  Silly man!  I guess I am supposed to be at home cleaning the house and cooking him dinner instead of out at the barn ridin' my pony.   So Cheers to Dobby, for bringing back the Margo I know and love, and making Jason show his true colors!

      Wow, what a great weekend....it had all the stuff a good weekend requires:  Good weather  Good horses  Good company  Good music  Good racing  Good times   I went to the George Strait concert on Saturday night.&nbsp; AWESOME.&nbsp; It has been ages since I have seen the man.&nbsp;&nbsp;incidentally, this was the first time I have&nbsp;seen George Strait of legal beer consuming age.&nbsp; Having a beer while&nbsp;listening to this old (and still handsome) cowboy really did raise the bar for enjoying&nbsp;a George Strait concert.&nbsp; What I like about&nbsp;George Strait&nbsp;is&nbsp;that it's not about flare, flash, or smoke and lights (for those of you&nbsp;who have&nbsp;seen  Pure Country ,&nbsp;that last part makes sense).&nbsp; He is about singing songs and playing music.&nbsp; The Ace in the Hole Band was on too, they just want to play music.&nbsp; It was great.&nbsp; It's always great when you can go to a concert and be one hour into it and know that they haven't even played half of their best songs....that you still have an hour of great music to go.&nbsp; Wonderful, simply wonderful.   However great the music was, I need to comment briefly on the venue.&nbsp; I am not a huge fan of the Quest Center Omaha.&nbsp; It's really in a strange spot and parking is mostly miserable.&nbsp; The worst part of the Quest Center is the frickin' Omaha cops that are supposed to direct traffic and people.&nbsp; They CLEARLY need to take a lesson from the Lincoln cops who direct traffic/people on a Husker Football day!!&nbsp; Fellow Huskers, you know EXACTLY what I am talking about.&nbsp; The Lincoln PD has a   P-L-A-N   on game day.&nbsp; Everyone is expected to adhere to said plan and everything is orderly.&nbsp; Omaha police need a lesson in this.&nbsp; For example, if, on game day, you choose to risk your life and cross the street when you are not given permission by LPD, you will get your ass chewed all the way across the street.&nbsp; Omaha PD had people jaywalking, stopping traffic, ignoring red lights and pretty much creating a cluster-f***.&nbsp; We needed an LPD officer to scream " GET ON THE SIDEWALK NOW ".&nbsp; Folks, on Husker game day, you do not mess with LPD, and that's that.   The race.&nbsp; Ahhhhh.....it was nice to have NASCAR back this weekend.&nbsp; I am such a redneck, I know.&nbsp; Kasey Kahne had a top ten finish, that's awesome, just getting points and getting closer and closer to that win.&nbsp; I love ya Kasey!!&nbsp; Also, my two other favorite drivers, Ryan Newman and Jamie McMurray, were in the top ten as well.&nbsp; Super.&nbsp; Get em' boys!&nbsp; I also learned that&nbsp;I do not want to have second degree burns on my body.&nbsp; Little E looked miserable, I am not sure that I have seen anyone in quite that much pain.&nbsp; Sheesh.   I'm off to St. Louis tomorrow.&nbsp; I am quasi-excited about this trip.&nbsp; I have to present my research at the American Society of Animal Scientists National Meetings.&nbsp; That part is sort of boring, but I have a night to mess around in St. Louis.&nbsp; I have never been there before, so I might hit the riverboats, play a little Let It Ride, go to the arch and do that touristy stuff.&nbsp; Wednesday is going to kick butt as Kristi and I have tickets to the John Mayer concert in Bonner Springs, KS on our way&nbsp;home.&nbsp; I love the amphitheater in Bonner Springs.&nbsp; Outdoor sound, beer, seeing John Mayer on a road trip, getting to wear my almost alternative clothes, two concerts in&nbsp;five days.....SHIT YEAH!&nbsp;   "If you want love, we'll make it"&nbsp;- John Mayer&nbsp;

      I got new tennis shoes on Tuesday.&nbsp; I love new shoes.&nbsp; They are the greatest thing in the world.&nbsp; Why, you might ask?&nbsp; Well, it's just nice to slip your feet into shoes that have nice arch support and padding.&nbsp; Not your old crappy shoes that don't have any of those things left.&nbsp; I think if my feet were able to, they would say "Thanks pal!".&nbsp; I always feel like I have a little more energy in the day when I get new shoes.&nbsp; That little edge of tiredness seems to disappear with new shoes.&nbsp; New shoes are so nice.&nbsp; I wore them yesterday and I have them on today.&nbsp; Ahhhh.....

      I don't really have much to blog about today.&nbsp; I am relatively boring.&nbsp; Watched the new FX show  Rescue Me  last night.&nbsp; It stars Dennis Leary.&nbsp; It's not too bad, kind of funny at times, but definitely not going to replace  Nip/Tuck  in my eyes.&nbsp; It makes me look at Dennis Leary in a whole new light.&nbsp; He is a troubled firefighter with the NYFD.&nbsp; He lost his cousin in 9/11.&nbsp; I say troubled because all of the people that he has tried to save in fires and that have died pop up at strange moments and he has conversations with them.&nbsp; The final scene showed him on the beach with all his dead people following him off the beach, some of them helping each other walk off the beach.&nbsp; It was kind of weird, but for some reason really struck a chord with me.&nbsp; We all have our baggage that we carry around, and even though our baggage isn't always people we lost in our lives, it still follows us much like his did.&nbsp; It was just a very interesting image for me.   Well, back to finishing the last of my "work" in graduate school.&nbsp; Cleaning the desk out and turning in keys next week......but still feeling quite liberated with the "everything will be ok, just trust Jeff and your instincts because flying by the seat of your pants is not the worst thing in the world" mantra.&nbsp;

      I am not sure what exactly is taking place here in Nebraska, but the heat wave seems to have made it nearly impossible for people to drive.&nbsp; It is like the heat and humidity has hit some override button in their brains and rendered them incapable of driving in normal fashion.&nbsp; Either that or the heat has melted the speed limit signs, causing the numbers to wilt, and has lowered the speed limit.   What in the hell is going on around here?&nbsp; All of yesterday, driving around town, and driving up to the office this morning, I&nbsp;have been perpetually stuck behind people who REFUSE to drive the speed limit.&nbsp; I am not by any means advocating speeding, my request is much simpler than that......Merely drive what the sign says.&nbsp; If it says 45 mph, DRIVE 45 mph, NOT 35 mph.&nbsp; If the sign says 60 mph,&nbsp;DRIVE 60 mph, NOT 40 mph.&nbsp; For goodness sakes.&nbsp; It is not like I am in a hurry, but I want to at least drive the speed limit, so that my estimated times of arrival are correct.&nbsp; Being perpetually late for things because the rest of this town is heat stroke-ridden and blind as a result gets old and annoying, very quickly in fact.&nbsp;   I am going to steal Jeff's idea as a proposed solution to my problem.&nbsp; Every vehicle will be equipped with a laser gun and a sensor.&nbsp; If someone commits a driving crime of&nbsp;any variety, like the jackass driving 25 mph under the speed limit in front of me, I would pull out my laser (please say this like Dr. Evil) and "tag" the offending vehicle.&nbsp; Each vehicle's laser sensor would have a limit of 5 tags per day.&nbsp; If you tick off 5 people and your car gets tagged 5 times in one day, your car won't run anymore and you will be forced to pull over and have to ride the bus or thumb it to your destination.&nbsp; You would be able to tag people for more than just driving under the speed limit.&nbsp; You could tag them for pulling out in front of you, for tailgating, or any other form of moronic driving you can think of.&nbsp; If you are habitually over the daily 5 tag limit, your insurance company and the police would be notified.&nbsp; It's brilliant.&nbsp; Who do I need to talk to about getting this started?

       Because I have a lot of time to do this during the day right now, I think about stupid things.&nbsp; This morning, I have been thinking about what kind of new vehicle I want.&nbsp; Right now I want two, because I can't decide.  &nbsp;  First I want a red sports car.&nbsp; I don't know if I want a really fancy Corvette or a Viper.&nbsp; All I know is that it has to be red.&nbsp; Candy apple red.&nbsp; And it has to be fast.&nbsp; Really fast and horribly impractical.&nbsp; Not really sure why, but that's what I want.  &nbsp;  Secondly, I want a navy blue diesel Ford Excursion.&nbsp; The limited edition diesel with towing package.&nbsp; I want the room to put all of my crap.&nbsp; You see, I am quite tired of hauling two dogs and all of my stuff in a single cab pick-up that doesn't have the room for two dogs and all of my stuff.&nbsp; It has to be navy blue to match my horse trailer.&nbsp; Since it can do that, it would practical.  &nbsp;  Interesting enough, my horoscope said that I would be divided between creativity and practicality today.&nbsp;......

       I would like to start out wishing Dale Earnhardt Jr. a&nbsp;bunch of "get well soons".&nbsp; I hope you are feeling better.&nbsp; For you non-NASCAR fans, Dale Jr. was supposed to drive a Corvette in the LaMans race on Sunday and he wrecked in an early morning practice session.&nbsp; The fuel cell of the car was trashed and the car was completely ablaze.....including the driver.&nbsp; Props to the fire suit as ESPN reported last night that Dale Jr. Received only minor burns on his face and legs and will not miss any Nextel Cup Events.&nbsp; Get well soon buddy!&nbsp; We can only hope that people will not quit discussing the Kennedy Curse and not begin speaking of the Earnhardt Curse instead!     &nbsp;   So, I attended my first Antique Machinery and Threshing Show yesterday.&nbsp; I met this idea with a tiny bit of skepticism, but WOW, it was COOL as hell!&nbsp; All kinds of antique tractors, stationary engines and farm equipment.&nbsp; What a cool thing to attend.&nbsp; I had never seen an old steam tractor let alone the threshing machines.&nbsp; These old machines had like 80 foot belts that ran off the tractor and served as the PTO.&nbsp; Amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots of demonstrations on how these machines separated oats and oat straw.&nbsp; They also had stationary engines that ran the first washing machines.&nbsp; Thank you Maytag for your advances in technology as I am pretty sure I would have sucked at laundry then and would probably have hated it more than I do now!&nbsp; Also present were draft horses that demonstrated how wells were drilled and gave plowing and hay cutting demonstrations.&nbsp; What a good time.     &nbsp;   Jeff and I watched Johnny Depp's  Secret Window  on Sat. night.&nbsp; What can I say about Johnny Depp?&nbsp; "A" stands for Awesome and "H" stands for Hot, as usual!&nbsp; Oh yeah, and the story line was great too.&nbsp; I give this movie at least four stars out of five, so rent it!!!&nbsp; I have an inkling of fear, however.&nbsp; Without giving the story away, the killer buries two people under a cornfield and then eats the sweetcorn all summer long.&nbsp; The sweetcorn thing comes from a written story that is the center of the movie.&nbsp; Jeff keeps telling me he is going to grow a bunch of sweetcorn wherever we move.........&nbsp; So people, if I randomly disappear......please check Jeff's cornfield!!

       Have no fear folks, the sea on which the Lady Jamee&nbsp;is sailing is now calm.&nbsp; Things are restored to status 'normal' after two epiphanies last night.&nbsp;One:&nbsp; everything is going to be ok and life is really not that bad. Two:&nbsp; If you shorten the one stirrup that is longer than the other, it is a lot easier to sit in the middle of your horse and you have a fantastic ride.&nbsp; Both of these things are profound, I am aware of this.  &nbsp;  So I would like to thank the CBS Early Show for the absolutely  riveting  piece on teen fashion this morning!&nbsp; It was wonderful.&nbsp; They were explaining to the adults with teenagers audience that the low slung-pants and belly-exposing shirts are on their way out.&nbsp; That teenagers are rebelling to these Brittney Spears/Paris Hilton inspired "slutty" outfits and are demanding that clothes cover up those parts a little more.&nbsp; I am thrilled that the teeny boppers are&nbsp;taking such a stand, because I am one who doesn't like to wear such clothing unless I am going to a club and want to get tore-down shitty ass drunk, but since these digs are all the rage, that is ALL you can buy in the store nowadays.&nbsp; It is a&nbsp; true find  if you are able to purchase a pair of pants that don't show your crack when you sit down.&nbsp; Anyway.....the best part of CBS's quality journalism was the use of the word "prostatot".&nbsp; Evidently this is the word of choice to describe teenage girlie-girls that dress in all of the aforementioned clothes.&nbsp; Excellent.&nbsp; I love it.&nbsp; And sometimes I wonder why the terrorists hate us.....  &nbsp;  It was brought to my attention last night that I may need to reevaluate my original judgment on VH1's I Love the 90's.&nbsp; I agree, I think I may have been a bit harsh.&nbsp; The last four years have been great.&nbsp; I really need to give some credit to VH1 for matching 90's music to the particular scandal or phenomenon the comedians are discussing.&nbsp; They are doing a great job with that part.&nbsp; Also, last night Hal Sparks doing Sling Blade and Forest Gump impressions in the same bit was probably the best I have seen in a long time.&nbsp; I had forgotten why Hal Sparks is on the list of "Ten Men I can Have Sex with and NOT Get in Trouble with Jeff" until last night.&nbsp; Thanks for the reminder Hal!  &nbsp;  Here is a weird deja vu moment for ya, I was just blogging about sex and "I Feel like Makin' Love" just came on the radio. .....Odd.

      If there ever was a day for Kasey Kahne to come and sweep me off my feet...today is the day!! Kasey...I need ya!.   So I'm in a completely  foul mood , have been since Monday. I am certain that it all seems much worse than it   REALLY   is, but for crying out loud, I just want to curl up and cry for hours right now. I think it comes down to a number of things:  1. I have to clean my office out in a little less than three weeks and I don't have a friggin' clue what I am going to do with my life.  2. I have the potential for two jobs in the Scottsbluff area, but I am not sure if that's where Jeff will go.  3. Jeff has an interview with Alltech today, and if he chose to take that job, he would have to live within 2 hrs. of Columbus and I don't have any idea what I would do living 2 hrs. from Columbus.  4. Which leads my very girlie, dramatic mind into thought processes that only make things feel worse.   Life really can't be that bad....can it? Surely I am just thinking about it too much and things will work out just like they are supposed to.....Jeff and I together and happy WHEREVER we are.....right?? Not moving together seems entirely pointless and a waste of everyone's time. Maybe I just need to suck it up and adapt, not settle, but just adapt. We shall see....   What I really need in my life right now is a little stability or Kasey Kahne to ride in on his white horse and take me away to a whole new world :) I think I should hold my breath on the stability !!!

      I saw the most endearing thing this morning.  Mrs. Bigglesworth, my cat, made a little kitty friend.  The neighbor's cat had gotten out and the two of them were having a silent kitty conversation across the screen of my living room window.  My windows are at ground level and the two cats were sitting there meowing and purring at each other.  When my presence made the neighbor kitty get up and walk away, Mrs. Bigglesworth was quite distraught.  She paced up and down the window ledge, calling for her new friend.  I find this quite interesting because just last week I was ready to get rid of said cat.  She has been chewing up my hair elastics, my bra straps and has been knocking over the little garbage can in the bathroom, carrying trash ALL OVER the house.  She has also been especially bitchy with Jeff's dog.  Lots of spitting and hissing going on in the house.  I thought she just needed to be an outdoor cat, but I guess she just needed a kitty amigo!  Too bad, I'm NOT getting another cat!  I thought kind of hard about asking the neighbor if he wanted another cat because these two were obviously meant for each other!  My cat is really really sweet when it is just myself and my dogs, but add anything else to the mix and she is CRAZY kitty!  My plan is to let the cat live outside (and be a mouse catcher in my barn) someday soon, but maybe the correct thing is let her live next door, where she can be one of two in a cat-only family.  Who knows.  I'll check with the neighbor, I know Mijo and Jeff would be quite happy!

      So VH1's I Love the 90's gets two and a half stars out of five from me.  It seems that I Love the 90's is lacking some really good humor and one-liners that made up I Love the 80's and I Love the 70's.  Lots of the I Love the... regulars are missing in the 90's.  Like Uncle Kracker and Rich Eisen.  We need good ones like Rich Eisen's "I don't mind the fish smell.....F*** that's going to be on TV isn't it?" when referring to the movie Mermaids.  The best part of the 90 and 91 from last night...John Mayer (whom I LOVE) rapping to the Humpty Dance and then actually doing the Humpty Dance.  Classic.  It is possible my friends, that the reason I am less than impressed with I Love the 90's is because I was flat-out  EMBARRASSED  to think about some of those things and how I was totally into them!!!  Man, I was such a  DORK !!  On to other things.  Has anyone ever had the Jiffy Peanut Butter Snack Bars?  If you haven't, I highly recommend them.  I swear I have a problem.  I am obsessed.  I would eat them at every meal if I could.  I have two hopes: 1) There is a 12-step program for people like me and 2)I will eat them so much that the greatness wears off and I won't like them any more.  Sheesh!  HELP!!

      I have noticed my Obsessive-compulsive Disorder (OCD) rearing it's ugly head the last two days.  Yesterday, while making dinner, I wasted three paper towels because my one-handed pull-from-the-roll technique was producing rough edges.  Therefore, when I put said paper towel under the cutting board (to soak up meat juice) the rough edge wouldn't line up perfectly with the cutting board. This morning, I about had a melt down in the shower when I realized that the labels of my shampoo bottles were not facing out.  While brushing my teeth after lunch, I rolled/squeezed/rolled/squeezed my toothpaste tube at least four times before I was convinced that I was not wasting any toothpaste in the bottom of the tube. Usually, this sort of OCD behavior only ravishes my normally normal life when I am stressed out.....but I don't feel like I have anything to be stressed out about right now?  It could be hidden stress about moving/growing up/job issues, but I'm not sure. Maybe I just need some horse therapy. Unfortunately, it's too hot and miserable to ride.  On the upside, VH1's I Love the 90's starts tonight.  I CAN'T WAIT.  I'm sad, I realize this.  But who doesn't want to see comedians and otherwise funny famous people bash, knock and crack jokes about the fads, trends and highlights from the time period when you were 10 to 19?  A moment of TV wonderment if you ask me!!  8 CST on VH1.  Check it out.

      Just read this on FOX SPORTS:  "He definitely needs to get suspended," said Ray Evernham, owner of the No. 9. "That's the problem with him. Nobody has ever really grabbed him and given him a good beating. If he doesn't get suspended, maybe I'll do that. I don't know (if he'll get suspended). But right now he's just crashed a bunch of cars, and he's leading the race. Look what it cost this team. We certainly had a shot of running up front today. It could knock us out of a shot at the top 10."  Way to go Ray!!!, I bet there are plenty of people that have your back!!

      So, I am hacked off right now.  In all actuality, I have been hacked off since yesterday at about 3:30.  So at this point, I am hacked off AND bitter.  For those of you who did not watch the race yesterday, here is the recap:   Roughly half way through the race, there was a caution flag and at the restart the ever popular and wonderful Kasey Kahne was leading the race, more than likely on his way to victory lane.  During the restart the 20 car, driven by Tony Stewart, ran into the back of the 9 car, spinning Kasey into the wall and out of the race.  Tommy Baldwin, the crew chief for Kasey Kahne, left his pit box and walked down to the 20's pit box to "inform their crew chief that the driver of the 20 was a moron", at which point everything came to fisticuffs and a large shoving match between pit crews ensued.  Tony Stewart, though he is a driver on probation for his many ass-hole moves on the track, went on to win the race.   Thank you Tony Stewart for ruining Kasey's chance at his first Nextel Cup Win.  You rock, you really do.  What I really think is that you should take your "I'm a NASCAR Bad-ass" attitude, your toothpick-fetching tiny dog, your hootchie momma slutty girlfriend, and your drama-queen self back to open wheel racing and leave all of the nice, talented people like Kasey Kahne alone!  So there.  I would like to say that I am rather proud of Tommy Baldwin though.  I was screaming "Get 'em" the whole time.  It was so redneck, but man Tommy, that just screams teamwork!!  I am proud of you guys.   Since I'm on my soap box......NASCAR seriously needs to go back to Fox.  NBC SUCKS!!  I had to watch the race with the TV on mute and listen to the radio because I couldn't handle the crap the retards at NBC were saying.  I want Jeff Hammond and DW back!!  Furthermore NBC, your graphics suck....I couldn't read the ticker even with my glasses on.  I think I'm finished, I feel a little better, but not much.  I have to go read the NASCAR website to see if they fined Tony Stewart and his pit crew.....

      Ok, first a little business, then a little rambling.  My friend Scott is a dick, BUT, since I am one of the best friends any guy could have (are you listening Kasey Kahne??)  I am still going to do as promised....Scott, today's meek blogging efforts are dedicated to you and the "stupid computer" you are trying to install.   Ok, train whistles.  In my home town (Kasey Kahne - that would be in Wisconsin) we don't have much of a railcar transport system, at least not as large as in Iowa and Nebraska, so I wasn't familiar with trains and their aforementioned whistles until I began my undergraduate program at Iowa State University (Go Cyclones!!).  Upon moving to Ames Iowa, I discovered how important the BNSF is to the state of Iowa.  Ames is a relatively small town with two major BNSF tracks running right through town.  It was kind of annoying when you needed to meet your peeps at the local drinking establishment downtown, or you were late for class and you lived not so much on campus, but other than that, not really a huge deal.  My senior year, I lived on the edge of town, in a duplex that was one small block from the tracks and a RR crossing.  Fear not loyal blog readers, I was on the proverbial "right side of the tracks".  Knowing full well that the trains went by at least every twenty min. (on a good day), we could still sleep with the windows open at night.  The trains never shook the walls and the train whistle didn't both you.....because of an amazing and wonderful investment that the City Of Ames had made....a little something I like to call electric train whistles.  These humdingers were hooked up to the same thing that triggers the arms of the RR crossing bars and the flashing lights, so as soon as the train hit that, the bars went down and the electric train whistle sounded.  This electric whistle made it so that the train conductor did not have to toot his horn.  The sound of the whistle was like a train, but was specially designed to direct the sound down the road of the crossing, and not let the sound spread out all over hell.  What a wonderful thing.  I would love to go to the Lincoln City Council and recommend the installation of these babies near my apartment.  And here is why:  So there is a BNSF line (two tracks)with a RR crossing at least .50 miles from my apartment in Lincoln.  The trains go by there at 25-30 min. intervals, 24 hours a day.  I know this because I have been woken up at night by every single one of those suckers.  If you are in my apartment, and the windows are open and the train goes by, you will swear the train is in the parking lot......regardless of the fact that it is at least .50 miles away and down a hill from me.  There are people that live in nice houses right next to the RR crossing.  I feel even worse for them.  Maybe they will jump on my electric train whistle bandwagon too....  Furthermore....if my electric train whistle campaign can't get a foothold, then I would like to have a little chitty-chat with some of the train conductors.  I know that they are just doing their job, but for the love of God, is it really necessary to do four to eight little sharp hoots and then blare the SOB for two miles before and after the crossing?  It's like Ron White says: " HEARD YA ".  So, I realize that this hasn't solved my problem, but as I can hear the train going by right now, at least complaining about it on my blog has made me feel a little better.  Maybe, if I wanted to be really childish about my angst towards the train, I could run down there and throw rocks at it.

      My friend Will reminded me yesterday that we had an agreement: if I did indeed start my own blog, that I should make an attempt to gain the attention of the apple of my eye.....NASCAR Rookie Driver of the #9 UAW/Dodge Dealers Dodge,  urlLink Kasey Kahne .   Kasey is a really nice, attractive young man, who quite honestly ladies, is just waiting for me.  He hasn't met me yet, but that's because I have to come up with a clever way to meet this little hottie NOT at the racetrack. See, there are too many little race car driver wanting ho's at the racetrack.  These golddigging honeys are pretty ruthless and will do anything to get with a driver.  Don't get me wrong, I want to get with this particular driver, but I am going to do it sans racetrack.  It should be about us and how we have been on a crash course towards each other...not about his famous racing or my famous......whatever.  Anyway.  I am really NOT a stalker and I will most likely never meet this adorable gentleman, but if he is ever bored on an off day, just happens to be perusing the internet and just HAPPENS upon this page, then he can drop me an email or give me a call or whatever he feels like doing.  That would be super.  I promise I am not one of those hopless ugly girls Kasey!! We could maybe go on a nice date....( I promise not to talk for two straight hours Kasey!! (Please reference People Magazine's 50 Hottest Bachelor's Kasey Kahne article for all of you non-fans)).  Additionally, if any of my loyal blog readers happen to have a connection with Kasey or NASCAR and could hook us up, that would be equally super.  Kasey- Miss Margo can't vouch for my cake making abilities, but she can vouch that I am an independent women who knows her way around the barn and a Nigerian Cashier's Check scam!  Sorry to my boyfriend Jeff- I promise you kick-backs if you give me up to Kasey, like pit passes and all that stuff.....

      I find it really interesting that I got interested in this new little habit called "blogging", got really excited to have my own blogspot, was formulating things to blog about for days before this particular blogs inception........and now........I have nothing to blog about.  Strange.  Maybe I can use my first blog to figure out how to use the word blog in world record number or maybe I just need to chalk it up and realize I suck at this.  That can't be it....the real answer is that my blog is going to be just like Seinfeld, a hit blog based on NOTHING.

      I sent Jeffrey's mother an email to thank her for raising such a wonderful son. I sent it right after I broke my arm and Jeff was being so wonderful about helping me out. ( He still is helpful, by the way) His wonderfully faithful and religious mother sent me an email back telling me how sorry she was about my broken arm, that she was praying for me and that though it may not seem possible now, in due time, I would, indeed, find the silver lining (God's reason) for breaking my arm. Here is what I have come up with possible silver linings so far:  a) Somewhere between UNL graduation and Scottsbluff, Nebraska, I am going to meet Kasey Kahne and he is going to notice I have a #9 UAW/Dodge Dealers Dodge red cast, call me his biggest fan and fall in love with me. Morrisville, North Carolina, here I come (that's where all the NASCAR drivers live).  b) All potential employees in Scottsbluff will find my bravery in taking on an 1100 pound steer so great, that they will be fighting over employing me for $500,000 a year.  That's it folks, that's all I can come up with. If God broke my arm, he really needs to fix it. He can tell me about the silver lining later.

      It was brought to my attention yesterday that amid ALL of my broken promises to Scott, the biggest, most offensive one was not blogging about my experience at my first tractor pull. I DO apologize and here ya go.  The day before I broke my arm, I attended the Wayne County Fair and watched my first tractor pull. Scott had been telling me to go to a tractor pull for about three years and I just never got it done. Wayne County Fair, here I come. Tractor pulling gets five stars out of five from me. I would have to say that the tractor pull was quite possibly one of the coolest things I have seen in a while. I watched the Busch Pullers, which was the highest level of tractor pulling in NE. These guys have the fire suits, the helmets, and the cages. The whole shebang! There is lots of black smoke and loud noise. Some of the pullers in the Super Stock class had turbine helicopter engines on them. That....to me.....is NOT a tractor, but whatever, it was kind of cool to listen to them. They hum and have a high pitched whine.  With all of that said.....I don't believe that I will be taking up tractor pulling. Granted, it is very cool, I believe that NASCAR is the redneck limit for this city kid. Tractor pulling is like NASCAR for farmers, in a way. I would like to hang out with Scott at a tractor pull, just to see what goes on "behind the scenes", but I'm pretty sure I'm not giving up my dressage horse. Sorry Scott :)

      My apartment complex is NEVER lacking in drama RE: emergency services. Despite living in the nice part of Lincoln, I am convinced I live in the ghetto. We have had one person commit suicide, two people get assaulted on the running path, one family burn their apartment down when someone tried to put their cigarette out on the couch, and multiple domestic disputes. This all results in Lincoln EMS, Fire and Policia arriving here on a regular basis. But quite honestly, this guy takes the cake....Seriously.  On Wednesday night, I was taking the dogs out and the Fire and Ambulance arrive. No big thing. Thursday morning we wake up to watch the early show to find out that one of my neighbors has shot himself in the leg. I repeat, SHOT HIMSELF IN THE LEG!! By accident, of course. You see, this bright gentleman had a 357 Magnum, loaded, in his coat pocket. What in the hell?? Yeah, a 357 Magnum, loaded, in his coat pocket. Two things come to mind:  1. If the 357 Magnum is in your coat pocket, how did it get cocked and fired so that it could shoot you in the leg?  2. Why does one have a 357 Magnum in their coat pocket? What on earth do you need it for? Street creds so that the nasty gang that lives in Ruskin Place Apartments doesn't get ya? Maybe that pesky kid splashing you in the pool? Do ya get PO'd if someone forgets to clean the tanning bed after using it? I mean REALLY.  I wonder if the 911 dispatch people and emergency services just roll their eyes when they hear a call from Ruskin Place Apartments. Actually, I bet they get excited....."What kind of craziness can we see now"?

      I would just like to thank the University of Nebraska-Lincoln for screwing me ONE last time before I graduate (by the way, graduation is this Saturday). So, we get paid for trips to meetings such as my recent trip to St. Louis. Meals, mileage, hotel, registration, and parking are all paid for, but of course, there is a catch. There is ALWAYS a catch with UNL. So, we get paid $0.375 per mile, so I claimed my 880 miles on my personal vehicle, which comes to $330, when you add up my other expenses, my voucher comes to $605.50. HERE is the catch, if other people go to the same meeting, but they fly, UNL pays least cost travel expenses. Thanks to two other professors who flew (for $165.00 airfare) I am now only going to get $165 for mileage instead of the $330 that I claimed. Thank you, I appreciate it UNL. I guess a broken left arm is just not enough for you people.

      I was watching the Blue Collar comedy Tour last night and if Bill Engval ever happened to read my blog, I need his assistance. You see, a bright red cast lends itself to a lot of "Did ya break your arm?" from perfect strangers. I was wondering if Bill Engval could give me a suggestion for an answer, because try as I might, I can't think of anything funny to respond with. It has to be of this caliber:  "Did you lock your keys in the car?" (asked to the guy trying to open his car door with a coat hanger) "Nope, I just washed it, it's time to hang it up to dry"  Please Bill Engval, I need your help.

      Here is the list of Top Ten Things You Cannot Do When Your Left Arm is in a Cast up to Your Armpit:  *Please note this is the result of exactly an 11-day exhaustive study.  10. Walk two dogs at the same time 9. Eat a chicken sandwich at Red Robin with ANY dignity 8. Shave your right armpit 7. Clean the house without being completely exhausted in 20 min. 6. Tie your shoes 5. Itch your nose with your left hand because you have crap on/in your right hand 4. Button the top button of your pants 3. Sleep on your stomach 2. Put on a bra without assistance 1. Have sex (This is not entirely true, sex is possible but a huge F****** production because both parties are extremely worried about the cast and who is comfortable)  Com'mon short arm cast....we need ya (I, Jeff, my dogs, my horse and especially my sex life need ya)  One humorous and good thing about a cast up to your armpit that is bent at a 45 degree angle.....You are always a winner at the "I'm a Little Teapot" song, as you have you have a PERFECT teapot handle every time.

      Doesn't Jamee L. Amundson MS MD sound nice? I think so. I think it is time that I suck it up, go to med school and show these morons how it is done. Here is the latest debacle RE: my broken arm.  So I broke my arm in Wayne, NE which is two and a half hours from Lincoln. At the Wayne Medical Clinic, I saw my x-rays and with my extensive knowledge of anatomy and physiology (of animals and the peeps), I identified the nice clean break in my ulna. Dr. in Wayne put a cast on my arm, said "Two weeks in this long arm cast, four weeks in the short arm cast". Ok, that's fine. So Monday, I go to the new Dr. in Lincoln, who I really don't like. I explain everything to her (about my broken   ULNA  ) and she proceeds to call the Wayne Medical Clinic for my records. Medical records arrive via advances in technology called a fax machine, and the Dr. comes in and says "It's actually your radius that is broken". Uhhhh no, I'm sorry, that is not correct. So I argue with her about it and she won't listen to me. Now, I realize that a great majority of the time that I am an idiot, but not that day. I was on that day. So, I leave that clinic ticked off because she says I have to be in the long arm cast for longer because she thinks I have a broken radius.  Lets take a moment to have an anatomy lesson and perhaps both Drs. could read this, evidently you both need to brush up on your anatomy of the human body. The ULNA is the smaller of the two arm bones and it runs on your the pinky finger side of your hand. The RADIUS is the bigger of the two arm bones and runs up the thumb side of your hand. Now granted, these two bones do cross at your elbow when you twist your forearm, but that does not change their location in relationship to the fingers on your hand. When the ULNA is broken, patients will pass out (or likely barf in radiology) when you ask them to rotate their arm at the elbow. If the RADIUS is broken, the thumb will likely not work and making a fist is much more difficult. Additionally, if you feel a bump (or bone "step-off" as we professionals like to call it) on the pinky finger side of the arm, that is the ULNA.  With that said, I called the Wayne Medical Clinic to have my original films sent to Lincoln. The radiologist called me back to remind me that the films need to be sent back to them. I said that was fine and told her of the "mix-up" in my records and the good doc here in Lincoln did not believe me. She pulled out my x-rays and said "Why yes, that definitely is your ULNA that is broken". Why thank you, I now feel vindicated. I can't wait to have a consult with the Dr. here in Lincoln. She is going to get a nice suuuprise. Maybe this time she'll be a little nicer to me.

      We have created option D for possible stories on how I broke my arm:  D) I beat the living crap out of the Nigerian Cashier's Check Scamming bastards. I suffered the broken arm in the only ONE good punch those a-holes could land...and look, all they could was hit me in the arm. Weenies. They aren't going to try to scam ME again!

      For those of you NOT in the know......I broke my left arm on Friday. YEAH. I can tell you that it really rocks. No, actually it doesn't. For the sake of telling the story for the 500th time, here it is. Actually, I am going to make this like a Choose Your Own Adventure Book and you can pick the ending you like the best:  A) It was my last day of work and my last day of graduate school and I got wasted at the bar in an act of celebration and tripped on the sidewalk and broke my arm when I fell.  B) Jeff, in a moment of greed, with his green eyes on my life insurance policy, pushed me out in moving traffic, in hopes that my "accidental death" would be lucrative for him. Unfortunately, I only suffered a broken arm.  C) I was working cattle for Dr. Mader on my last day and we were working with people who were not very experienced. As I pushed six 1100 pound steers into the tub, someone walked into the tub, turning the steers back on me. One hit me in the hips and took my feet out from underneath me. I fell so fast, I couldn't catch myself and all 110 pounds of me landed on my left forearm.  I am in a bright red (Go Huskers!!!!) cast up to my bicep. The morons that call themselves Drs. are disagreeing about whether or not I broke the ulna or the radius and whether I am in the long arm cast for two or three weeks. I know I broke my ulna, but the doctors are morons and I am sure that they will be a source of much blogging. Along with my arm, I broke the ten year accident free status at the Haskell Ag Lab. Go me!! All in all, I feel pretty good. I get very frustrated because everything takes me FOREVER. It's amazing how tired I am at the end of the day. With half the arm power, I expend twice as much energy. Strange.
