      Wussup brothers?  This is something that I just decided to get goin' cuz I was getting tired of my yahoo interface!!  Brothers can post to this site on whatever topics they like!!  One quick visit can update everyone on what is goin' on in the Rho.  From parties to BBQ's(you know I'm down!) to formals to Rho events to informational speakers to "What's really good!" Or brothers can even just jot down what's on there mind that day or post the latest most interesting website that they recently enjoyed.  Posting pics and audio is all good too!  But beware brhothers...this site is extremely accesible from the internet and it can also be found on blogger.com's blog lists.  Well brothers I hope this is an enjoyable new forum in which we can all interact. And always KEEP THE RHO ALIVE!!!   E-White

      This thing is freaken awesome...check it out at the  urlLink Apple Site! &nbsp;It's a must have for workin' out! Or settin&nbsp;up a playlist and connecting it to your stereo for house parties...Ewheezy to this Gadget...it is the absolute Shiznit...I ordered one!!&nbsp; I was originally unsure about whether to get the IPOD or the IPOD mini...but all my worries were washed away when Apple released this beheamoth!! The best of both worlds...and the price drop is a sure win!! Slimmer (like me) and with a ClickWheel!! What more could a mp3 player have...(well it could have more, but it would never look this tight!)&nbsp; I'll post a pick soon!   Farcyde

       urlLink    Heh Brho's, I was just trying to decide which one of Apple's nuts&nbsp;I should swing from. Which one of these do y'all rho's think is the better choice: the  urlLink  Ipod mini   (small, sleak, 4GB) or the  urlLink  Ipod 15GB  (bigger but&nbsp;only $50 more for 4x the space)? Let me know what you think!

      I hope everyone is well.&nbsp; I am busy studying for the MCAT and getting my applications to medical schools all sent out.&nbsp; Life is damn stressful, but in the end no man will ever regret hard work...I realize that now.&nbsp; To all the young Rho's.. enjoy college, it will definately, without question, be the best years of your vato lives! But the more&nbsp;  urlLink Dedication   you show now to your education and the less time you spend fucking up your&nbsp;head on some toxic shit, the more chance your will become, in the future, that&nbsp;image of yourself you have picture in your head&nbsp;(with a suit and a Ferrari, and a trophe wife).&nbsp; I promise you that none of these things will just fall into place... urlLink  you gotta work for it  !  &nbsp; Well brho's I hope you don't mind me venting a little on here...just gotta maintain...ya heard? One love and ALWAYS HIT THE BOOKS AND THE BOOTY!! &nbsp; Farcyde &nbsp;  LET ME KNOW WHAT BRHO'S ARE THINKING THESE DAYS!  add a comment! &nbsp;
