      So this week begins HELL week. What is HELL week? Well, in my life there are&nbsp;three HELL weeks. The first one comes early in the year. We also refer to it as marathon week. This is Holy Week before and including Easter. Starting on Monday of Holy Week there is mass every night. The hard part begins on Thursday nights when we have the re-creation of the last supper/washing of feet/Prayer in the Garden. Starts off with Mass up to and ending at the Eucarist. Then the ceremonial washing of feet as Jesus did to his diciples to remind us that we are each servants to others. The lowliest to the highest leader is each a servant to all. The night ends with Eucaristic Adoration and praise/worship singing till midnight. Then comes Good Friday. Since the Mass the night before never ended we pickup somewhere in the middle with more reading in the liturgy followed by yet again Eucarist. This time after Eucarist the living stations of the cross are preformed and once again we head for Eucaristic Adoration and praise/worship until Midnight. Sat night is something similar yet since you have been there every night ALL night since Thursday it can seem to do one of two things. Totaly uplift you or totaly make you crash. We arrive at the church just as the sun begins to set. This is sunset mass, the first celebration of Easter Sunday. Once the sun sets we light a bonfire and from that light and prayer light the new Easter Candle. Then everyone lights smaller candles from that and processes into the church which is pitch black and only illuminated by the hundreds of candles. We then listen to readings for a few HOURS and sing intermitently. Then we get a short break and come back 30 mins later to listen to MORE readings. We then renew our baptism vows and are sprinkled with holy water from the fountain. Following is the Eucarist of course. Finaly we end in a final prayer and sing for the first time since Lent began Alleluia and listen to one final Gospel reading before processing out and saying for the first time since mass started Thursday 'The Mass Has Ended'. Essentialy the Mass started Thursday and did&nbsp;not end until that moment on Sunday morning at 12:30 or 1:00 am. Sat was a long mass huh? Wait, I'm not done yet! Since I am one of the youth coordinators I have to be BACK at the church for sunRISE mass at 7am with the teens. Talk about a LONG week. Well, thats not this heel week. heh, I bet you are all wondering 'Why in the hell did he explain all that for nothing'? Simple, more to read. This week is inventory week at work. From this monday until NEXT sat. I work 12-13 hour days and have no days off. OMG this sucks. I call this mini HELL week though because this is only the mid-year inventory. We do it ALL over again come december for end of the year inventory and that is even worse considering we have to scrutinize EVERY SINGLE SPEC OF FRIGGIN DUST in the warehouse. So yea, if ya don't hear from me soon I'll be behind a pallet of door skins taking a nap. ADIOS!

      I've spent this entire day since 8am thinking about this weekend, the things I have said and done, and the changes I never noticed. After my last post I laid there on that hard couch and the anger in me just exploded. I have always thought of myself as a nice guy, not perfect, but nice. I swear though the anger was so intense I could have started swinging. Even at the time of feeling that I felt this pange inside myself that made me want to turn that fist back against myself for feeling that way. Am I jealous of something? Have I become selfish and self-centered? Have I become the Drama Monster that I despise so much!? &nbsp; I sit here now back at Tyler and I's apartment, the time of us moving out growing ever so near. Part of me is afraid; another part sad; and yet one other portion of me is happy. Afraid I will lose even more than before the person I care more for than anyone else in this world right infront of my other best friend David whom I also almost lost to a move to Florida as well. Part of me is sad because I know Tyler wants to do something different and/or move out on his own instead of into another place with me. The happy part has sunken and hidden itself deep inside my fear that it will go away. That happy part is the excitement of owning my own condo, but I am afraid I will not be happy with the ones I might have to settle for. &nbsp; Back to the subject at hand concerning this weekend and my intense inner-reflection. I find my mind comparing me to someone that lost Tylers friendship recently. To some on the outside they would have thought the two of them were inseperable friends for life. Living with both of them however you get to see what goes on in the real world. She owed him tons of money as well as was never any fun to hang out with anymore because of her constant moods and attitudes. Her possesive bitchiness when she was not his center of attention, and her constant abuse of his good heart and nature. If I have not already in some ways become this ugly of a person I fear I fast approach. Even this post reflects some of the letters she had written him in apology, even though this is not directed completly at him and more myself. My debt to Tyler is growing, and while I know I have no intention of not returning what he has assisted me with there is no doubt in my mind on some level it irritates him or at the least hurts him monetarily because he could use the extra cash right now. My moods this weekend are startlingly crazy. I as of last night viewed the entire Birthday trip as a horror and failure. What I have come to realize is I am a complete dumb shit. Yes, there were some bad things that occured but that should always be expected. When it happens and is over most people move on and have fun. I instead have been focusing on those crap moments and they shaded out the super awesome times this weekend. Take for instance last night I had the most fun I have had in a long time dancing up on the box. Once I got my ass off the sidelines and let myself go I had a wonderful time. The night before, Tyler got drunk and he is always a blast when he gets drunk (As long as he doesn't get sick ;-)). Kristina bought me this awesome shot and we had some laughs even though I was tired beyond measure. People knew I was not having much fun because I was tired but they tried so hard to all for my benefit and not their own. Last night I had a BLAST at dinner even though i was stressing for no reason and the limo was wonderful while my idiotic mind starting picking out all the imperfections I could find no matter how minor. When did I become like that? As a Christian I should   KNOW   there will never be anything that we do that will be perfect. It's the focusing on the things that ARE right and good that we should be doing. &nbsp; There have been extremely few times I have  EVER  yelled at Tyler. However last night Kristinas judgmental view of the other most important person in my life hurt me really bad. The situation may have made her uncomfortable yet I was not sympathetic to that. Instead I took it out on Tyler and yelled at him as if he was to blame for his friend. Being your brothers keeper in absolutly no way applies to that instance!  &nbsp; The bed thing, which is such a STUPID and MINOR thing I blew up into a huge ordeal! HOW THE FUDGE DID I DO SUCH A STUPID THING!? How could I have let that ruin the night when I had been having fun? How could I also have been so damn selfish? Yea, I paid for it and Derek didn't. Big deal, I had the bed the night before. Plus I didn't come back till WAY later than they did. Why shouldn't he have had the bed? Why should I have expected him to sleep on that hard ass couch when there is room on the bed with his friends? &nbsp; Okay, here we are at Derek. This is where that mention of jealousy comes in. Derek is Tylers best friend, my mind has formed that into more of a competition for a position I have no right to intefere in. Tyler and I don't seem as close as we were before and I blame Derek for it. That is totaly not fair. If anything blame myself. Derek, while I attribute alot of his actions as stupid in reality he just knows how to have fun. He is more outgoing, talkative, and willing to do whatever even if he gets labeled as stupid or whatever. He doesn't care what others think, he has fun and that is fun to be around... for those who let it be. I have come to the realization that I have become so damn uptight that I no longer know how to sit back, relax, and just have fun or let fun come. I am no fun to be around. Who wants to spend most of their time with someone who has a contagious bad mood? I can only think that habitual 'bad mooders' who thrive off it can enjoy each others company. Have I always been this way and just never known it? Or did it just appear over time and I just let it seeth through? &nbsp; I am so afraid of loseing my best friend even more that I am blind to the fact in reality I am going to be the cause of the loss unless I do something. Now the question is  CAN  I change? How long if so will it take? I don't know if I can do it overnight. The best course I can think of is to stop dwelling on it now. I have done the thinking, come to the conclusions, and now that I have them I have to CONSTANTLY be self-aware. If I dwell on it though I continue to do the same thing as before. Think of the bad things and therefore they become prominent. Gosh this is super difficult, huh?  :-P  &nbsp; Oh yes, one side note. Thanks to the one constant in my life that never changes, always stays the same, and will never leave me no matter if I change or am the above. In my time of need and in my time of joy my Father is always with me. The Spirit never allows me to be lonely and I would like to contribute todays realization to the Prince of Peace whom centered me in my dispair as he always does. The church was stranger to me, the mass was nowhere near my favorite, and the Priest could barely be understood. Through that all I was able to be centered in my state. The anger was removed and I was comforted. Praise be to the one who never fails. Amen. &nbsp; Oh stop looking at me like a fanatic :-P Above all powers that becomes my strength. I know even most Christians are not that straight foreward and it might seem overdone, but that is the one place where I have never let what others think influence me like I let some as like posted above. I can crank up the latest Worship song in my car and sing horribly at the top of my lungs and nothing can phase me, not even the cute boy in the car next to me makeing a 'crazy' gesture to me of my idiocy. &nbsp; Okay, stop reading now. I begin to ramble if i go further.

      Okay, so I turned 23 on Friday. I hate getting older. It wouldn't be so bad had my Birthday trip not been such a fucking bomber. What happened? I really don't think you want to know. I'm going to tell you anyway.  &nbsp;  Here's the deal:  I planned a trip to Houston with my best friend Tyler. I rented this awesome room in the&nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink http://www.hotelderek.com Hotel  Derek. The room costs 175 a night. Awesome room... I don't mind paying, hell it is my Birthday. On top of that I rent a Limo for Sat night and plan to take all my friends out just for fun on my buck. Not a cheap thing I might add. I told my friend he could take his two other friends that he hangs out with along. One of these people totaly get on my nerves a lot but I thought 'Hey, I can deal with it and Tyler will want him to go'. I worked 1/2 the day on Friday and got off at 3pm. The  PLAN  was to leave by 4pm so that we could beat rush hour and have time to chill in the room. Guess what, didn't happen. We didn't leave until fucking 6pm. Means we got into Houston around 10pm. Okay, I'm not exactly pleased but I can deal. The weekend is gonna be a blast.  So here we are at 10 in the room. We plan to goto South Beach with my friend David who is staying in another hotel. We don't end up leaving for the club until midnight. David wants to go pickup two of his other friends. TOTAL DRAMA HAPPENS. His friends are not ready. Somewhere along the line the other friend of Tylers get this paranoid idea that David is upstairs with them doing drugs. She gets pissy, starts to call a cab to leave and all that mess. Mind you that my friend is a COP and also a Registered Nurse. I also HIGHLY doubt that he would have taken us there so he can do drugs while we wait in the living room. I mean, JESUS FUCKING CHRIST! If you know me at all you know it takes a WHOLE FRIGGIN LOT to make me start cursing alot let alone use the Lords Name in vein. There it is folks, big capital letters, but you know what? I'll get over it. Actualy, no I won't. Not till the next day. By the time we reach the club I am tired, pissed off, and ready to cry. My Birthday was a total fucking bomber. On top of that the friend of Tylers that gets on my nerves get piss ass drunk and is acting like a total and complete fucking retard. Thanks a whole fucking lot. We  FINALLY  get his god damn lanky ugly ass out of the club. Literaly have to DRAG him out. We go back to the hotel. Guess how fucking long it takes to get his ass into the room. MORE THAN 30 FUCKING MINUTES! He's tripping around like a total fucking loser making a fool of himself and grabbing for attention. He could not have been THAT fucking drunk, I guarantee he was just grabbing for attention. Oh yes, he also breaks Tylers 400 dollar glasses. What a great friend.  There is more to that night but I don't want to get into it.  I was hoping this venting would help me calm down but I am only getting angrier so for now I will stop. Let me just say that right now his fucking ugly ass is sleeping in the bed I AM PAYING FOR and he isn't giving a fucking dime for when his ass should be on the hard couch that mine is on. Oh yes, I don't even get a MOTHER FUCKING BLANKET! I am useing a fucking TOWEL THAT DOESN"T REACH PAST MY WAIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! OH MY FUCKING GOD! I HAVE CRIED 3 TIMES ALREADY ON THIS TRIP AND I AM ABOUT TO AGAIN. I JUST WANT TO FUCKING SLEEP AND GO HOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Okay, so today I was a bad boi. Last night (weds.) I went out with JC. We went to the Comedy Club which was fun and a change of pace from the norm. I do have to admit that while not bad, the show was most likely the worst I have seen there. Especialy the 2nd act, he totaly bombed. What I think was funny about the guy though was that a lot of his material was gay-oriented. Okay, well, BAD gay oriented. Usualy if a comedian is good it's funny more then deragatory. This guy was somewhere between neither and none. He was just stupid. I do swear though that he would look over at me while telling his stories and rather random crap and something would trip him up. Either he knew we were gay, or could tell he was bombing. That's the best thing about being at one of the tables infront of the stage. Anyways, the comedy was mediocre and the bar tab was huge. Overall not a bad time though. After the comedy club we headed off to the Quarry and went to see Spiderman 2. From what I remember of the movie it was pretty good. he alcohol from the club though kind of put me to sleep durring the movie. I hope JC wasn't too upset at that. We came back to my place and then proceeded to watch a Drew Barymoore movie. How better to send yourself to sleep than laughing at her dresses and antics in this movie. We cuddled to sleep and then came the crappy realization... my alarm went off at 6:30. Time for work. No sleep, early morning, and a serious wish to stay in bed. I got myself up however. Drug myself to get ready and off I went, leaving JC sleeping in bed like a little baby. Awww, how cute.  So here I am at work... 7:30 am, the rumbles of machinery and scrambling of forklifts all about me. So i take my happy ass upstairs into the breakroom to finish my paperwork from the previous day. The cool air sends me off to lala land in no time and here rolls around 8:30. I suppose I could have stayed and slept a little longer, but nawww. I went down into the warehouse and just walked around a bit. I know my boss isn't too happy with me, but oh well. If she has a problem she can take it up with my dad. It's not like I goof off all the time. Shes just mad becuase people have talked about her while shes been taking a few days off. 10am rolls around and I can't take it anymore. I'm tired, i'm hot, and I have a hotboi sleeping alone in my bed. The picture just doesn't look right. The easiest solution? BYE BOSS! I'm sick! I'm going home!  So home I went, whistling and coughing. I jump back into bed and cuddle-sleep till almost 3pm. I coulda stayed in bed longer but we ended up going to H-E-B and buying some food for lunch. I came home and fixed my lemon-butter chicken pasta which usualy elicites this huge responce from my friends... think I didn't use enough lemon this time though. JC unfortunatly went home and I zonked out till about oh... 9pm. Thinking about zonking out again cause I gotta work in the morning and this time actualy do something. Latta.

      So maybe I reacted too soon. Here I am being an idiot thinking I totaly FUBARed this opportunity with JC. Less than 30 mins after that last post he called me and was wondering why I thought he was mad and would never talk to me again. I most likely need to erase my last post, I laid it down pretty thickly. But you see, that's how my mind works... me, I tend to over-analyze a situation. I come to un-founded conclusions which got me into this mess in the first place and which sent me to the place I was until his call. From now on I need to take a step back and look at things and say 'Hey, slow down! RED LIGHT! Do not pass go until next dice roll.' Maybe I can learn a valuable lesson from this excercise? Or maybe I will need to be hit upside the head with a 2x4 before I realize what a fool I am.  Maybe I am making myself move to fast. Each time I find someone I am interested in I tell myself to take it slow... but it is like a teenager who was just bought a brand-new Dodge Viper for his 16th birthday. I grab the keys from my parents, give'em a hug and rev it up. Before you know it I am sailing down a residential street at 112 MPH. Sooner rather than later I am either going to get pulled over by a cop and thats my warning or my tires are going to spin out and I will lose control into a telephone pole or into on-coming traffic. I think I was just handed my speeding ticket here folks. Now it's time to fess up to the parents that they owe a $500 fine for speeding through a residential school zone and payed no attention to the work crew laying down pavement. The penalty for that is a lot better than running over one of the workers.  Not that it has ever really happened to me before. I may be a spoiled brat since I was an only child... but like hell I will be given a dodge viper.

      Well, I never got to finish my post about the best day I have had in years. Let me summarize really quickly what transpired and then let me explain to you guys why I am such a blasted idiot and may have screwed something up that I will not forgive myself for.  You have me smiling like a fool out in this warehouse. I think that is where we left off. So here I am basicaly a road kill target for the first forklift driver who flies past me. Do I care? No, why? Because I have met the sweetest guy I have met in a very long time. The night before I came to work we just layed in bed all night cuddling. In the time that I spent with him there, my arms just wrapped around him, I wanted to be nowhere else. If someone were to tell me that heaven never existed and that our time on this Earth were only to be made in what we did here and now then this would have been my Heaven.  I will never trade anything in the world for the moments that night I spent with him. Again this past Sat. we spent the night at my best friends house. We cuddled all night and then in the morning we held each other till almost lunch. The prior night he had told me that the only time he felt alive was on the dance floor. That morning I told him that I felt alive just being there with him in my arms. Nothing could be further from the truth. I wanted nothing more than to do whatever I could to make him happy. That 4th of July we spent at my friends house, the entire time we held hands - I layed in his lap - and we smiled at each other. It was more than I could ask for.  I left that afternoon to goto a picnic with the owners of my company. He was going to leave as well and I told him he could stay. I went to the picnic and had a decent time but all I thought about that night was when I would see him again.  Monday afternoon we talked and joked and everything was fine. I e-mailed him the pictures of us from the night before and stated how much I hated how I looked like a friggin chipmunk. He stated how much he hated how he looked like a racoon on crack. When someone types 'lol' you might find something 'heh' funny, but when he said that I truely laughed out loud. Things seemed great. Even though plans we had to hang out that day had fallen through he said we would work something out this week and I was happy just to know he still wanted to know me.   Now this is where the me being a total and complete idiot comes into play. I talked to him again that evening, he was doing the family thing. I tried to get him to come over and watch a movie before he went to work. I even tried the guilt thing and the puppy dog face over the doesn't quite work as well as it does in person. Oh well, no big deal. I had been making the stupidest joke about him and my best friend as well that day and I went a little too damn far.  Why do I just not know when to quit!? Why can't i just leave well enough alone and move on to something different? Why do I try so hard to make someone laugh that it becomes un-funny anymore and then serious? Finaly, why do I have to go and say something that I know for a fact is not true and make something of it?   I hate drama, I can't stand to be a part of it. Here I am the one who causes it. Dammit, it is like I can't stand for myself to be happy so i go and fuck it up for myself. Not only did I make myself not happy, I made the one person that I want to make smile and laugh hate me now. I hate myself for it and I wish I could only be given another chance. I wish there was some way to fix this. I have tried apologising in voice-mail. I have tried text-msging him. I would gladly do anything to fix it and yet I don't know what to do.  JC, if you are reading this, please try to forgive me. I don't want to be a cause for saddness. All I wanna do is try to make you happy and work to become part of your life. I promise to do whatever it takes to make things right. I wish I could be perfect but I admit that I am not and never will be. I just wish that you would give me one more chance and set things right.  I have always said that 'I wish I could give someone the world, even though I could never afford to.' Now I only ask if you can settle for someone who just wants to make things right and make you happy.  To everyone else reading this, if you know where I can find a copy of the book 'Dateing For Dummies' please let me know. I desperatly need it.

      Alright then, so maybe it is way past morning time. So I got my post time a little later than I planned. Actualy I also would not be posting now if someone was not kinda poking me in my side to do so. Oh yea, one more thing, the same person poking me in the side is gonna be mentioned in this post so I dunno if I will write everything I intended to write or just kinda play it safe and keep a few things locked away in my 'top secret'  folder upstairs.  So where do I begin? With the crap that happened to me about a month ago which kind of slapped me in the face and started my transition to the upward turn in my life... or with my Absolutley Fabulous day? Okay, we will save the slap in the face for some other day.  So... day Ab-Fab. It happens to me once through extremely long periods of time. Kind of like when you really want work to be over and keep starring at the clock but 5 never comes around. You would think a Thursday on the job would be like any other day counting stupid wood door skins and triing not to get run over by the forklifts as the drivers... who I don't know how on God's green Earth got certified to drive a death cart of who knows how heavy industrial equiptment... whizz to and fro thinking about the 6-pack they will be drinking after work and the blowjob they will get by their fat girlfriends. Yes, especialy after describing it that way how and why did this become to best day I have had in years?  I spent all day with the grin on my face that just makes you want to beat the shit out of someone wearing it on the sidewalk. It's kind of like 'You bastard, your to happy for me to let you continue to exist. Come back to reality with the rest of us losers.' However here I am... with that damn grin around 10 death machines and a convient grinder for making saw dust, singing away the worst songs ever... mainly one or two that I wrote but sometimes don't claim. Everyone thinks that the white boi has completly lost his mind. Got the picture?   Okay, now you get to keep that picture in your head for awhile and wonder WTF is up. I kinda just lost my mood to smile and write about it. Oh, don't worry, it's not like I will fall off the side of a cliff tonight and you will never get the chance to find out why the white boi was inviting pain into his life by being happy. Even if so, then the world will just be short one more stupid white boi...  ***To Be Continued***

      I do look blonde, don't I? Okay, that was a total rhetorical question. Seriously though, the first title to the first post in what will hopefully prove to be an amazing and successful adventure (That is assuming of course I can keep up with my own life) explains everything that will follow for the next few posts. Things have begun to zero in on a specific moment in my life which promises to be most interesting as well as a mental growth spurt in terms of expanding on who I have become. There is absolutly no doubt in my mind that the events which have begun to take place will have a most profound impact not only on who I shall grow to be years from this very moment but as well as on whom I once was. What is with the dazed and confused part then? Simply put, before I can document this change in my future history I must first lay the basic building blocks of who I am prior to this evolution. If I were to say this will be an easy journey then I would definatly be lieing off my fat a$$. It is sure to be a rollercoaster ride straight... excuse me, 'Gay-ly Foreward' from the right hand of God into the living room of Lucifer himself (Who's bringing the stuff for smores?) and hopefuly right back on up again.  Oh nonono, don't think I am going to bore you with my lifes history here people. Hell, I am sure that will be evident in a basic oil-painted picture as we move along. I say   we   because I sure hope I will not be taking this journey solitaire. Once I get this damn disclaimer and welcome to my life post out of the way we should start getting to the fun stuff. Just in the past 2 days itself I have much ground to cover on how I ended up here with a grin on my face while moments later the proverbial bat was knocked upside my head. Of course we will get to that in a post and two later. Let's not get ahead of me here though. This is after all my disclaimer and my intro...  First things first - I'M GAY. If that might prove to be a problem for some of you it damn sure isn't mine. I like who I am and I like who I like.  Now if you got past that first brick thrown at ya here comes a larger one - I am a Christian. Yes, I can be both and I proudly accept both as who and what I am.  Hmmm, now that I have killed four birds with two bricks (Let's say for continued readers sake we can count out Homophobics, Militant Non-Believers, Hardcore Baptists, and the Pope) I can safely say you are in for a fun cataclysmic ride with a half hair-dresser/half Jewish-carpenter, walking, talking, breathing, singing amusement ride. I can shift from many different moods in my days to many different writing styles in my posts. Some might have you laugh; some might make you cry; and as someone said to me earlier, you might just throw up a little. There is a convient bag located in the front pocket of your seat for just such an emergency. Okay, I need to stop running everyone off... here is what is left for this(my worst and dumbest written post you will ever see here) blob of text. I will briefly explain my Blogs name/title even after all those definitions. Lastly I will list a preview of that is to come in the next post or two(which will be made in the morning when I am not half asleep and can actualy write creativly instead of crappy and think clearly) in a very short listed format.    M.ulti F.aceted P.lane of E.xistence  Hopefully you all kinda got the meaning of all the words... but how does it apply to me? Each and every individual on the face of this Earth is very complex and unique in their own way. I myself like a Diamond (even one still stuck in a piece of coal) have many different sides and shapes. Some people know more about me; some know less; some of my best friends know things about me my other best friends do not and vice-versa. There are things kept wrapped up inside that I may never tell anyone at all. This Blog is partialy here to see how all these Facets fit together in my one life and also prehaps discover why. I'm even interested in learning something new about my own self in writing all of this. Kinda got it? If not stick with me on my posts and I am sure it will be made cleaer as time goes on.     Okay, here is the end to this boring long piece of text and an explination which will lead into the REAL Blog's beginning. In the coming posts I will be covering what happened yesterday on the best damn day of my life in nearly four years(Hence-forth refered to as 'Day Ab-Fab'), why it may have been such, and who may have made that possible.  The saying what goes up must also come down is definatly a line I shall never agree with. The farther it goes up the more it must also come down and sometimes even defying the law of gravity it will speed up on it's way in.   So thats it for this thing here. Watch back after I get a good nights rest for the real Blog to start. Afterall, I haven't slept more than 3 hours in 72. I sure hope you can see fit to forgive me then for what hath started out on a ricky road but will roll on into some fun and interesting stuff.
