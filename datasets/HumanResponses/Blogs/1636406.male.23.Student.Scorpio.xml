         That's about all I have to say for today.  Tomorrow I have Japanese, I'm SO unexcited about the whole deal-- let's hope I feel good tomorrow and I can stay awake.  So um... yeah that's about it--   ...OH!  I watched  urlLink Party Monster  last night, and I have to admit I really liked it.  It was completely dystopian, but so is life.  I wish my life was more exciting these days-- perhaps that's what's killing my motivation.  So much for the weekend.  -Ry

      Update: The Tickets were sold out!!! so I saw the dead sea scrolls instead (BORING!).  I wanted to see Taiko badly, but life enjoys making things unfair.     The Dead Sea Scrolls were so boring, there was no translation available, and it just was... pointless.  Some dirty pieces of paper under some dim strobing lights-- those dirty pieces of paper are so ridiculously pointless.  I'm sorry to say that to all the religious nuts-- but think of all the people suffering around the world, then thinking of all the money going into preserving and showcasing that nonsense.  Even if that money went to giving 3 people fresh water it would be worth the loss.  So my 2 cents again- but it's my weblog :)

      Today I'm hoping to see the  urlLink Kiyoshi Nagata Ensemble.       I'm actually pretty excited about the whole thing-- while I'm there I'm hoping to see the dead sea scrolls which are showcased in the same building.  I will post more later after I've seen the performance.   -Ry

      Let me just start off by saying: I hate  urlLink Old Navy .  The clothes may be poor quality, and often ugly- the stores might have the atmosphere of a Chinese sweat-shop, but my real problem with Old Navy is the television advertisements blaring 24 hours a day.        An orgy of colour, beauty, and retardation   These ads seem to be formulaic.  You take a couple beautiful people, video tape them doing stupid things and make them smile.  You then throw in some weird progression of events and add a few unintelligible lines.  Worst of all Old Navy could probably show a video of a child cracking it's head off pavement and they would probably still see sales of their slave labour wares (yes, little hands do make little stitches).    Every-time I see one of these ads I change the channel- they are eerie, they make me loose faith in humanity-- and I think could even make me suicidal if my exposure was increased.  Old Navy commercials are pornography for christian-american-hillbillies, they project images of american stupefaction- and of the homogenization of culture in America.  There is also some real racial stereotyping going on-- you have to appeal to every "visible minority" and the formula for that is: 1 mulatto person, 1 asian person, with a variety of white people to interact with.  So to sum it up.... I hate these fucking ads!

      Welcome to my new Weblog. I hope you enjoy it.  I should be posting on a regular basis.  Today I had a  urlLink Japanese  test which I totally failed-- I was half awake, feeling like crap and I didn't have enough time to finish it.  It was horrible. Saturday, there is a  urlLink Taiko  performance at the museum of civilization.  I hope I get to see it- I really enjoy the sound.  Post more soon,  -Ryan

         urlLink Gmail  is  urlLink Google's  new web-based e-mail service.  It offers 1 gig of storage, junk-mail filters and a few other perks-- it's really nice!  Thank-you Google!  The service so far is great, I hope someone fixes the Safari compatibility issues and I look forward to using this service more frequently.  Thanks!

      some believe in the year one double odd three...     I saw  urlLink Kill Bill v.2  last night.  It was great, I really enjoyed it-- despite the fact a bunch of losers cackled at nearly everything shown on screen, including music, and a ski mask.   At one point during the movie I almost felt as if one of the characters was talking to me indirectly, it was kinda strange.  I can see that some people will have a hard time seeing the two halves as a whole, and I think that is an obstacle for this movie-- the one plus is that volume 1 was recently released, so my suggestion is: go rent or buy volume 1 before you see volume 2, you'll appreciate it more.  It was a great movie, I'd recommend it for sure-- I look forward to seeing it again in the future.   Thanks Quentin!

         I've done a lot of thinking and I've decided I don't want to come back to Ottawa.  What I have decided though is to try to get into  urlLink McMaster.   I've decided that I want to make Japanese my major, so that I am able to give it the attention and effort it demands, as well as gaining a skill that will last my whole life.  I really think this had to happen, I just hope that I am able to get in and that I can continue with my studies instead of being out of the loop for a couple years.  Wish me luck!

      Today I practiced the devil's tounge...  And I got through about 110 kanji and about 440-500 compounds. Mostly new compounds too- but none of that set in.  It was hard sitting in the heat figuring out how to pronounce compounds I've never seen, plus a few kanji I never knew... like bugs.  so now I'm about ready to hit the reset button with my trusty ice pick- my brain is too full, and I think I'm risking seizures looking at all these black little lines.  So tip of the day: Don't learn Kanji in the sun!

      So big bad Paul called an election for June... joy  This election is the worst election I've been involved with. You have Paul Martin, an out of touch, quasi-liberal wannabe conservative. You have Steven Harper, a deranged, quasi-conservative, right wing extremist-nut. Lastly you have Jack Layton, a true NDP leader- completely out of touch with the sad realities of the country.  All of the men running for prime-minister are pathetic. The NDP has a great platform, but how stupid do you think people are? You cannot promise the world and have it all work out magically.  Sadly you can't raise corporate taxes without a serious negative effect.   Steven Harper is the worst of the three, he appeals to the intellectually disadvantaged by spreading fear, anger and lies.   Paul Martin is pompous and completely out of touch with reality, but he is the least harmless of the big three.  In all honesty I want to vote for the NDP... but we'll see.  I may vote Liberal, It's fairly confusing.  I will write more as the stupidity develop.

           You Are....          A Swan!!      This was the show of the century for me. A bunch of fat, depressed, confused housewives give their bodies over to the  urlLink Fox Broadcasting Company  in order to be hacked up, abused, and caked with hooker makeup in order to compete with each other for some crappy-ass prizes!  It is sheer marketing genius.  There is nothing more enjoyable than seeing stupid people do very stupid things.  Now for my little rant: The finale was so rigged it wasn't even funny- it was stinkingly obvious. I knew Rachel would win after seeing the first episode- why? Because she was the prettiest so they put her on first to get people to watch the show. Rachel was also much taller than all the other girls, which for whatever reason goes far towards winning a modeling contract.  So the show was rigged! A shock to everyone I'm sure. I am keeping my fingers crossed that next seasons girls are fatter and uglier and require even more hacking and slashing.  Hell I have an even better idea: take a bunch of men that want to be women, give them a sex change and hormone therapy, then throw them in a beauty contest facing them off against The Swans... that would be my ultimate show.  FOX Execs if you read this and you like the idea give me a call-- I'd make a great producer.

        Supersize Me   Almost everyone I've talked to has at least heard about this movie.  It's a Michael Mooresque--sensationalist documentary, and as enjoyable as it was I felt this movie was lacking a little.  Don't get me wrong, I really did enjoy the movie. I find the topic to be fascinating, and I have to give kudos to the star/director, Morgan Spurlock, for coming up with the ingenious idea of capitalizing off one of the strangest aspects of modern culture. Despite the topic, the movie lacked the speed and coherence of most of Moore's documentaries and I think that as his debut movie Spurlock almost nearly hits the nail on the head.  Yes, this movie does have a message: eat mcdonalds and you'll die-- but it lacks the planning, and information to really get the point across. The movie ends up being a 2 hour circus show-- with some white guy scarfing and puking up quarter pounders. It disappointed me because Spurlock ends up meeting all these really interesting characters like Don Gorske, a John Lennon look-alike who is addicted to Big Macs due to his Obsessive Compulsive disorder. The most interesting thing about Gorske is he is in great shape despite the 19,500 Big Mac Attack.  You also meet some insanely overweight guy who is about to get his tummy tucked- and in some amazing cinematography you get to see the procedure accomplished. The problem is Spurlock goes nowhere with these interesting, and bizarre people. You don't get to see how Gorske lives- and let me tell you where there is smoke there is fire... I am willing to bet Gorkse's house was insane, talk to his wife for 5 minutes and I bet you'll hear some good stories. The tummy tuck guy dissaperes after the surgery- you don't see or hear from him again- what would have been interesting is if Spurlock came back to see the man and offered him a supersized McDonalds Combo-- just to see how much of it the guy could eat. What would have been even better is if Spurlock took all his doctors and some of these weird people in a bus, and drove down to McDonalds headquarters to not only make a scene,  but also to announce the results of Spurlock's evil diet.   Ultimately the movie was boring, there were too many scenes showing him going to the doctor, and too many scenes of him doing nothing. The movie didnt have enough weight behind it, it deviates off topic a bit, and the interesting characters are not put to good use. I suggest people watch the movie, but don't expect much-- the movie falls short of being a classic, but that doesn't mean it's not enjoyable. So cheers to Spurlock, the movie may have taken 10 years off your life, but I'm sure it was worth it.

      So I got this job, and get this it pays   $$$8.75$$$  . Wow, now I know how benjamin franklin felt when he received his pay- it's just too bad I'm not living in the 1700's.  To be honest I am going to keep looking for other jobs where employers understand the concept of inflation, and fair pay.  I also have been thinking about friendship a lot, and trying to figure out why it's so hard for me to meet people I get along with.  So again I'm tinkering with my life so I can increase happiness, and decrease the bullshit.  I guess things could get worse, and no doubt they will.  I just hope I can get into McMaster.

          I was thinking about the little creatures today, and realized that Mosquitoes are one of natures most benevolent creations.  They don't survive on dead organisms, and in order for them to live they require that their meals are living.  The males drink the nectar of plants to survive, while the females drink the blood of mammals in order to gain enough energy to lay eggs. Both of their meals exist outside of the insect realm, they do not eat other insects at all- which is interesting when you start to think of the diets of other creatures on the planet.  Mosquitoes are very successful at what they do- although interestingly enough their only real enemies are the elements and human beings.   Why is it the most powerful creatures on earth hate these little bugs so much? Because the allergic reaction to their bites are inconvenient and in the past Mosquitoes have been a source of disease.  The most interesting thing is that in order to kill mosquitoes people use really nasty chemicals, which in the long run could harm people more. Personally I would rather take my chances with a mosquito bite then to be inhaling or absorbing some toxic chemical thats bound to give me cancer.  So in a strange way, I've found a respect for the biology of the mosquito, and although they lead very simple lives- they are very kind to the world around them.

      ...I will have no money in 2004!   urlLink      Video Games were once a passion of mine. I saw them as the purest form of art with so much potential. But the Internet boom happened, and games were a casualty. The Industry started to receive attention, reports circulated on the profitability of games,  urlLink Mario 64  selling in excess of 10 million cartridges- pulling in way more than any hollywood blockbuster.  In fact the Video Game industry was everything the movie industry wanted to be: consoles changed every 3-5 years, there were competing standards that many families welcomed, and of course there were rumors of price fixing by the bigger companies like  urlLink Sony  and  urlLink Nintendo --the DVD business model was ripped right from the Video Game industry. The cow that broke the camel's back was  urlLink Microsoft  getting into the biz- first by working with  urlLink Sega  on their  urlLink Dreamcast , and eventually by releasing their  urlLink Xbox.  The mentality for any market it seems is- if it's good enough for  urlLink Bill Gates,  it's good enough for me to invest in.   When Sony entered the market in  urlLink 1994  things changed-- the old rules didn't quite fit there was heavy competition, and since then it has been maturing at a growing pace. Everyday there are more poor quality games hitting the market and many more movie tie-ins (which ultimately are not as bad as their forefathers see  urlLink ET ).  Nintendo reigned supreme since the '70's but was ousted by Sony. Nintendo survived by taking the stance they didn't care if they were number #1, they just planned to always turn a profit.  The strategy has paid off- Nintendo products may not be on the bleeding edge, but they always make a nice profit- unlike Microsoft who has lost a  urlLink fortune  over their Xbox.  So... Needless to say, seeing an industry grow up before my eyes was fun, I just had lost interest...  Until E3 of this year. The games coming from Nintendo  urlLink look great.   urlLink Zelda,   urlLink Metroid,   urlLink Mario,   urlLink Starfox  and most of all the  urlLink Nintendo DS  have really sparked my interests again-- the games are starting to get better, they do look good but may end up being total duds like most of the games i've played recently. (I'm keeping my fingers crossed).  I will buy these games, and a  urlLink Nintendo DS -- and I will probably love them. Sony now has its very own handheld called the  urlLink PSP - but I sneaking suspicion it will be overpriced and will not be worth the money.  I have a PS2, and I have to admit it isn't half as much fun as my GameCube.  So Kudos go to  urlLink Nintendo - you've survived  urlLink 115 years  and I suspect you'll be around for at least 115 more.

      My parents are crazy.  I have trouble figuring out just what is wrong with them.  Today I was actually writing a post about improving transportation problems in the world but I was sidetracked, by a rabid, menopausal, bitch of a mother who is on my case because I do not have a job. Whenever the economy is doing poorly it seems like it's my fault I can never find work. My resume is decent, I have a high-school  urlLink diploma  and a college  urlLink diploma  and two years of  urlLink university  on paper.  Finding a job is easy- I could work in any fast food joint instantly, or some miserable telemarketing job, so I try to hold out, I try to apply to different jobs, but because of insane pressure from two unstable adults who try to exert control over me as much as they can, I end up getting some ridiculous job that ends up making me unhappy.  Do they care?  No, I've learnt that no matter what I do they benefit in the long run-- and the only reason they are placing pressure on me is because they are miserable unreasonable people.  I can't take this nonsense from them anymore, it makes me unproductive, and I lose focus. I am going to keep applying and hopefully I manage to find a good job.  wish me luck

For those of you who do not know what Haiku is I offer you a  urlLink primer.

          I have decided to go back to  urlLink Carleton University  come September. I am looking forward to school, and I think that it is going to be a great year. I have learnt from my mistakes which were:  1. Roomates 2. Lack of transportation 3. some lack of confidence  Like anyone else I am entitled to my mistakes, but thankfully I have been granted the luxury to try again and to do things right.  It is anyone's guess how things will unfold this year- I believe I will succeed, and become a better person for it.  It has been a crazy weekend, and my head is still spinning, I have learned a great deal- and really gone through a lot of emotions. I am nervous and excited about the opportunities that lay before me, we shall see how things turn out.

      Right now I am torn up inside...  ... do I want to go back to Carleton? To the city I hate so much? Does everyone(thing) deserve more than one chance? Do I try to start over? or do I try to correct a mistake?  I don't know what to do...  I really loved some things about Ottawa, and hated others. I just am confused as to what I am going to do next year. The most certain thing is that I am willing to try again- and this time try 100 times harder, not to let myself fall into the same mistakes that plagued me before.  we will see what fate has planned, all I know is the stresses and problems with last year gave me grey hairs... I am not going to let that happened again in a million.

      I just watched the political debate and was so excited I had to run online... and well since I don't have anyone to talk to about the outcome, I am left with no choice but to talk to myself.  So first a summary, the election is charged with a handful of hot yet mostly irrelevant issues only because they are debatable and make good news. First we have the sponsorship scandal-- Let me sum this up by saying it is over-blown nonsense. 100 million dollars was spent on a sponsorship program, it is merely some pork barreling that went to liberal friendly agencies. So they spent the equivalent of 748 thousand us dollars-  big deal more money is spent in iraq in week. The second hot topic is privatization of health care. The only reason this is an issue is because of the popularity of the conservative party that will introduce private health care elements to our economy. There was also talk of other issues like gay marriage, funding for cities- but all were really minor points.  The majority of the debate consisted of Paul Martin getting picked on by Jack Layton, with Stephen Harper throwing in his 2 slimy cents and Duceppe asking a few questions. Layton was the most eloquent, and really came off as Trudeauish, and by that I mean fruity. Harper was mostly eloquent, but didn't say much, he came off as weak (which I believe he is) and childish, if I had to place a bet he's either the youngest or only child in that family. Martin resembled a goat attempting to climbing a muddy hill, he was all over the place, out of control, arrogant, and very ineloquent. Duccepe shouldn't have even been there- he was such a waste of time but was probably considered due to cbcs marketing purposes towards the Quebec market. It would have been more interesting to have thrown in the Green Party- but the CBC wants it's little turn at trying to stir a big pot so they threw in some french onions.  So before the debate I was going to vote liberal, but now I am most likely going to vote NDP. Layton is the strongest, and best suited for the job, Martin is an out of touch old man who disgusts me to be honest- here is a man with all the tools of government at his disposal, and instead of showing them off like a kid with his daddie's gun he makes promises!? It's insane, he deserves to lose.   I think I've decided to vote NDP. I don't care if Harper gets in- and if he lasts his 4 years without getting a bullet in his head it will be a miracle! Lest we forget the spartan army was comprised of homos- if Harper pisses them off who knows what they will do... and if he takes away the right to choose beware of pissed feminists.  Its going to be tough but I have about 13 days to think about it. Good luck to all those involved- I can't say I'm very enthused to see these results... but this is politics at in its most interesting state.

      Last night I got to see my cousin Lisa aka "Darling Starling" play in her band the Flamingo-gos. It was my first time seeing her play, and I have to admit she was really good. She had a little bass solo that sounded pretty funky. I had a good time and although I didn't say much It was really great. I left kind-of early because I was tired, but they were finished playing anyway.  Right now I am reading Against All Enemies by Richard A. Clarke, and Sleeping with the Devil by Robert Baer. Both relate to one another and both are excellent in my opinion. I am looking forward to reading further into the oil industry. Oil is something seemingly innocuous- yet we fail to realize the entire modern world has been built with and on oil. The economy is oil, the cities are oil, technology is oil- everything you  see around you required oil at one stage of it's production, whether that was in it's transportation or an energy source during fabrication. About 290 kg of fossil fuels goes into the production of one desktop computer not including transportation.   Most people think the oil industry is all about cars- but it's so much more, everything relies on fossil fuels, that is why the economy goes crazy when oil prices fluctuate.   Many people think that it's simple to convert to a hydrogen fuel based economy- but its near impossible. And I read somewhere it is enough of a problem to bankrupt every government worldwide for a century.  Ironically, because it is rich in hydrocarbons, and the infrastructure is in place- the best substances to use for hydrogen based engines are fossil fuels.

          So I am now working as a bill collector for NCO Financial. It is a little easier than I expected, but its hard when you have to deal with some very scary, strange people.  I am nice to everyone on the phones, because to be honest, as Ryan, I don't care if you pay your bill- I just leave messages and give you a chance to set your credit history right. Cause let me tell you- I have debts too, and when I'm working I do what they ask of me but I don't get nasty or over emotional because for what they pay me: it just isn't worth it.  So I've been there for a week and all is average.  I also had a fantastic weekend, props to Jarod!  So I will try to keep posting, but work eats my day away.

          Okay, I will admit I have to be crazy to be thinking this... but I drove someone home from work today and this huge urban sprawl had appeared while I was in Ottawa. I really had some mixed reactions. I have only been gone for a year, and it's like a whole world appeared in what was once farm-land.  When I was little my grandparents would take me to feed horses there... it just was so strange to see that all disappear and be replaced with houses and roads. It's so depressing.  I'm not sure if what I am feeling is natural or the result of a really tough day at work.  So lately all I do is work and rip cds-- My CD collection is so pathetically small I am scrounging to find cds to rip.  I can't wait till I go back to school.

          So after this weekend I've decided alcohol has been detrimental to my life, and because of that me and the bottle are breaking up for good.  I've never been much of a drinker (except for perhaps last year), and after the killer hangover I had on cheap vodka this weekend- I don't think I will ever drink again.  I really do appreciate fine drinks, and I just think it's unfortunate that they have to be laced with liquid poison. I guess that is part of the excitement of any drink... When you combine fine ingredients to make a tasty yet deadly drink it makes you feel good inside.  It's why people make shots with tequila and tabasco sauce, it's why people spend $300 for a bottle of wine. Sadly I will take a risk and live without CH3CH2OH floating through my brain.  Again, it may not be the perfect solution, but I believe it is a step in the right direction.  Perhaps if you're a casual drinker you might take a similar stance.

          So yesterday my registration package arrived, and today the courses were uploaded to Carleton Central.   So far everything looks good for a fairly clean schedule... that is if I can get into the courses I want to.  I have something like 34 days left at work!   woohoo!

          So last night I was laying in my bed thinking about life when I decided to open a book I had bought called   urlLink Fast Food Nation   by Eric Schlosser. I opened it up and just started to read, by chance I opened the book to the chapter on Mr. Schlosser's trip to a Slaughter-House-- The only way I can describe it is that it was shocking, disturbing, and more than enough to repulse me from eating meat for the rest of my days.  So I am a vegetarian, sort-of... I've decided I'm still going to eat fish occasionally- I don't think I could give up sushi.  Now I don't think it is hypocritical, I am a "vegetarian" because I don't agree with the practices of the meat industry, the fishing industry isn't great but they still haven't come up with a way to completely torture the lives of fish.  I think this is a step in the right direction.

      So I wrote this eloquent, long post yesterday... only to close the window by mistake and lose everything I had done (stupid tabs)...  I'm not going to get into what I wrote though, I guess it's just between Safari and me.  Lately I've been looking for an Apartment in Ottawa, it isn't easy- but it isn't that hard either.  I have my little eyes set on one place- it seems decent and isn't all that far from school. Next thing on the agenda is to get a laptop for school... it's expensive, but things are working out.  So now I just sit and wait (and try and save money) and study.  There just is not enough time in a day to accomplish everything I want to do.  So cheers to July!

          Ok I have to admit, MSN Messenger and my "so called" buddies are driving me insane.  First I need to calm down, take a deep breath and remember that this isn't 1996 anymore.  People have forgot how to communicate- Instant messaging has brought into the world a new era of asinine conversation and the ability for people to ignore you mid-sentence without having to endure the social pressures perfected over the course of our evolution as a species.  So I am thinking again that it is about time that I abandoned this cursed, monopoly driven technology and move to more staid forms of communication for example e-mail, and telephone.  I will mull over the details tonight, and perhaps compile a list of people that I would like to keep in touch with.  So if anyone wants to know why I no longer use MSN or AIM- it's because no one really ever chats with me...  bye bye IM- I wont miss you.
