      I've finally found someone who loves shopping more than me. Neil! Although I am very very mad at him because he bought the exact same pair of shoes that I got a week ago. Heh, no he didn't buy women's shoes I bought men's shoes, btw. Chuck Taylor All-Stars in black. Mine have hot pink laces from Hot Topic so...so there!

      Wing Chun, who runs twop with her husband Glark and their friend Sars, wrote a "Bad Teen Novel" that was first serialized at her website- hissyfit.com- and then published. I was too lazy when I was a kid to write a whole novel so now I present to you my very own "Bad Pre-Teen Short Story" My comments are in bold                                                                      Timmy and Katherine 				             By Katie  Setting: A romantic restaurant in Washington D.C. The candlelight is burning down on 18 year old Katherine  Ow  the candlelight is burning down on me!  Ouch! And 19 year old Timothy's  Aah I see now that we're so old he's "Timothy" and I'm "Katherine"  table which is in a very private corner. The boyfriend and girlfriend have just finished their ridiculously expensive shrimp scampi.  Where did that come from? I'm allergic to fish!  A waitress is bringing a beautiful heart�shaped tart  What is a tart anyway?  Something in the middle of the dessert glimmers and catches Katherine's eye. (By this time the waitress has left) She slowly realizes that it's a beautiful diamond ring  Okay 1) Is this an exercise on how many times you can use beautiful in a story and 2) How the hell did "Timothy" manage to afford a diamond ring?  Katherine looks into Timothy's soulful eyes  Well that's the most retarded thing I've ever read  and the band starts playing "I Need You Tonight" by the Backstreet Boys  Oh. My. God.  The candle completely burns out and he whispers "Well will you?" to which Katherine replies "Oh Timothy how could I not marry you? You're the love of my life. I've loved you since the day I first saw you  Heh, even though I thought your name was Jeffery  (a waiter comes and lights another flickering candle) Timothy slowly slides the ring onto Katherine's slender finger   Sssssssweet! I bet he has sweaty skanky palms.  He then pushes her hair, which hangs in ringlets  Urmmm my hair is stick-straight  away from her face and gently kisses her perfect lips  Oh look at me and my perfect lips! I'm gonna go out on the town with my perfect lips! Whoohoo!  and whispers, "let's go outside" into her ear  That's kinda gross  As soon as they leave the restaurant a horse-drawn carriage  Oh sweet sassin' frassin'  pulls up next to them. The driver gets out and lays down a red carpet leading up to the seat  Red carpet? Whaaaaaa?  "After you" says Timothy  Aww he's such a gentleman  Katherine sits down and smooths her silky smooth dress  Heh smooths her silky smooth dress. Did I mention that it was smooth? Smooooooth  Timothy sits next to her and she lays her head on his strong shoulder,  Remember Timmy? He was kinda scrawny. I wouldn't pin him for the strong shoulder type  they wrap their arms around each other and the carriage starts moving. Trotting past the dimly lit monuments.[sic] The driver drops them off by Timothy's car after they have cuddled for an hour  Excuse me while I go throw up  They drive to Katherine's house where they announce their engagement. As Katherine tells her parents  Ok that's something I'd like to see. Can you imagine my dad? Hee!  Her eyes fill with tears which Timothy lovingly brushes away  Ick ick ick ick ick ick. Gross! Get your hands away from my eyes Timothy!   	 	                                    Three Years Later   			             That's right.....there's more   Setting: Diane and Corrine  These are Timmy's sisters by the way  and Kelley are helping Katherine get ready for her and Timothy's wedding. They have had such a long engagement because Katherine's parents thought that they were too young to get married  Ya think?  But Timothy waited for her and now the big day has come. Corrine could hardly keep the 21 year old down to do her hair because Katherine was so excited.  I don't know if I would be "excited" to marry Timmy. More like I would have to be very very drugged up  She has been waiting for this day since she was 10 and everything had to be perfect.  But did she look �beautiful'?  Kelley was Katherine's Maid of Honor   Woo go Kelley!  And Diane and Corrine Schwartz were the bridesmaids. Katherine's 11 year old cousin Annika Ball  Oooh even my cousin is in this!  Was serving as Junior Bridesmaid. As Katherine peeked out of the tiny bridal room at BCC  Wouldn't I be getting married in Illinois?   the opening chords of the song the bridesmaids were to walk down to the aisle to.  I wonder if it was by the Backstreet Boys?  "You guys better go out there" Katherine says to her best friend and soons to be sister-in-law. "You too Katie, you're our following act" said Kelley   Hey look she still refuses to call me Katherine!  As they file out the door Katherine sees her father waiting to walk her down the aisle. Katherine watches as all the bridesmaids walk towards Timothy who is waiting for her at the altar. Katherine links arms with her father  Who if I know him is bawling his eyes out by now  and looks up into his dark face. "Dad, this is really happening" she says as she beams up at him  He now has a heart attack probably  "You really want to go through with this, honey? he asks her. "Of course I do, Dad, I love Timothy  You know what "Katherine"? Shut the Hell up.  "Well good because it's about that time"  I think that line is from a movie  Katherine listens as the organ  There is no organ at BCC, is there?  begins to play "Here Comes the Bride"   Aww man I wanted to walk down the aisle to "I Want it That Way"  "Well here goes nothing, Dad." Katherine whispers as they start to walk down the aisle. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  I have to go remove my brain from my skull and slap it silly for ever writing this.

      You know you shop too much when your brother links to your blog by calling it Confessions Of a Shopaholic which just happens to be the name of a book that you read, but he's never seen the book.  The sentence made no sense but I'm too lazy to fix it

      Kelley, darling, how long have I been telling you to stay away from guys? That right, since the fourth grade and that guy- what was his name?- oh yeah, Dani. Just stay away from Brent and Brayden. You don't need a boyfriend right now. To quote Gloria Steinem- "I need a man like a fish needs a bicycle"  What's the point? Dating is trying to find the man you're supposed to marry, no matter how much you tell yourself it's to have fun. That's the purpose of dating, Kell. You don't want to look back on your life and regret the things you did when you were 14. I don't want to sound all preachy or anything but you're messing yourself up and setting yourself up for disaster. If I hear that you've got yourself a new boyfriend I will hop a plane to OK and whap you on the head. And don't think I won't :)  Nail Polish Color Of the Moment: First Dance

      I just watched  On the Waterfront . Loved. It. That was due in no small part to my crush on young Marlon Brando.   Noel's horrible. He just made me a big sign that says "Hows About Them Cramps" *sigh* brothers.

      Aww Kelley wrote the sweetest thing about me in her blog. I seriously cried when I read it. And yes, Kelley, I do know the real you. I know your inner dork. Unleash your inner nerd Kelley! You know you want to! Someday I will visit you and meet all your vapid "friends" and I will reveal who you really are to them. Don't think I won't because I will. Or better yet, come visit me and we can be dorks together.

      I just found a mix cd lurking amongst the dust bunnies in my bedroom. So of course I had to put it on and see what I was listening to years ago. Wow it's really a mixed bag.   The Beatles- I Will Billy Joel- Only the Good Die Young Brandy- Have You Ever Christina Aguilera- I Turn To You Jessica Simpson- Where You Are M2M- Don't Say You Love Me Mandy Moore- Candy 9 Days- Absolutely  No Doubt- Ex Girlfriend Sting- Desert Rose Sugar Ray- Falls Apart Vitamin C- Graduation Aerosmith- Pink Foo Fighters- Everlong (acoustic) Goo Goo Dolls- Iris Jewel- You Were Meant For Me Madonna- American Pie Madonna Beautiful Stranger  Right now I like about 3 of those songs. And Jessica Simpson?  Jessica Simpson?  Jessica Simpson?  Ugh I detest her. She was one of the acts at this concert I went to several years ago (shut up it was free!) Man that cd is like a time capsule. Well at least there was no Backstreet Boys.

      Jeez, Mom and Noel go out driving and everyone calls. Leave me alone people! I'm trying to listen to some Etta James here! Don't they understand?  I got a Frank Sinatra cd at the library, Frank Sinatra rules. I better not tell that to Kelley- she'd think I'm even more of a freak.   Last night Mom was doing laundry and the only thing in my pajama drawer was my old Backstreet Boys t-shirt. I had to face my demons last night and it wasn't pretty. I put it on and instantly ugly memories flashed into my mind. Backstreet Boys concert with Kelley. Dancing to Britney Spears with Kelley. Writing a story entitled "Timmy and Katherine" all about me marrying a guy from our church. Shopping at Limited Too.  I don't like the person I once was

      oh well la-dee--da Neil. See w00t just has so much more meaning then simply woot. I must go back and edit  immediatly  :)  We went to see  Lilo & Stitch  after we picked Noel up from drivers ed. It was really cute. There were only like 10 people in the theater.   When we got home mom was upset because there was a note from her friend Nevin and his wife at our door. They had been visiting his aunt near us and stopped by on a whim but we were at the movie. Them and their  EIGHT KIDS , that is. Mom was really dissapointed, she hasn't seen them in years.  I went shopping again today, this is not good. Went to Ulta. I'm in love with Ulta. I want to marry Ulta and have a million of its babies. I, umm, guess I restrained myself. Except...not. I got OPI in First Dance and Pompeii Purple. Pompeii Purple is on right now. I lurve it. I got Neutrogena Moisture Shine Lip Gloss in Glam which was the color used on the model on the cover of July's Lucky. Then I got Jane Fabulizers for Eyes in Suede. I love both of them.   I got my hair cut after I went to Ulta. Just trimmed with a couple long layers thrown in there. My hairstylist curled my hair under at the end since it's so very straight. I have to go out and buy a large-barreled curling iron now 'cause I'm loving my hair right now.

      I have so much more respect for American Eagle Outfitters now. I wandered in there today and they were playing Kamera by Wilco. I just stood in the middle of the store, amazed. I closed my eyes for a second and I know I looked like a freak but it was the happiest moment of my day to know that some people in that store who might have never picked up a Wilco cd were hearing that song. On the way home I put on Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and told my mom it was the greatest album. She looked at me and asked what was so great about it. Could I possibly be adopted?

      Kelley's starting a blog- I'll put the link up soon as I get it.  Just watched  Chinatown  with Noel and Mom. It was really good. I didn't think I would like it but I did. Noel's got me watching a lot of good movies lately.  The Conversation  was excellent. I've been quoting it all week.  "Oh God. Every time I see one of those old guys I think the same thing. I think that he was once somebody's baby boy- it's true I do. I think that he had a mother and a father who loved him and now he's half dead on a park bench and where are his mother and his father and all his uncles now?"  Tomorrow night we're watching  Doctor Zhivago , my  pick not Noel's. Then the night after that we're watching  Bandits .  Staying up late every night is really doing me in. I almost fell asleep during the end of  Chinatown  and I'm about to drop right now. Oh and skipping breakfast every day is bad, no?

      Bad news about Aunt Janet. They thought the cancer was isolated in her breast but it had spread to her lymph nodes so it's not all gone yet. She might have to go through chemo, which like I said is not good for her heart at all. I've only met her once, at Grandma and Grandpa's 50th anniversary last summer, but she's really cool and really nice.  For tonight I decided on my black skirt from Express with the layers and a red lace up tee also from Express It'll look nice with my nails. And I think I'm going to go for Stila Convertible Color in Poppy for my lips and cheeks and Stila Eye Glaze in Pearl on my lids. I haven't really been wearing mascara lately because I've found that just heating my Shue Uemera eye lash curler up with a blowdryer works better then mascara ever does on me. Do I know the Pledge?  I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.   whoo go me!

      Katie: it is 1 a.m. you are tired. You have to get up tomorrow. Go to bed. No no-  go to bed . Why have I been having problems sleeping lately? I'm really freaked out because for the past week or so somebody has been calling the house and then hanging up. I know someone is there because I can hear them breathing. And when I do go to bed I have twisted dreams like the one below with my cousin morphing into a leprechaun.   Counting down the days until high school starts. Woot!

      I want to drive away and be free. I want the wind to whip my hair around me, stinging me across the face. I want to sing along to songs I haven't heard in years, songs I thought I never wanted to hear again. I want the sun to soak down on me, to fill me, as I fly away. I want to know that I can always come back, that there will always be a place for me. Someday I will drive away and I will break the confines of this house that is my security and my jail at the same time. It holds me in but one day I will be pushed out into the sunset and I will drive.

      I just watched the version of   Midsummer Night's Dream  that was done a couple years ago with Calista the Stick, Rupert Everett, Michelle Whatsherface and Christian Bale. Mmmmm Christian Bale. Mmmmm. Well anyway...moving on. I liked it (especially Christian Bale), I guess. It was pretty funny. Dad walked out of the room within the first five minutes saying he couldn't follow it. Dad doesn't  do  Shakespeare, per se. He came back for the play at the end, though. I spent the first half hour of the movie trying to place the guy who later played the woman in the play. Then I finally figured out that he played Pollux Troy in  Face/Off . But I just looked at his IMDB Filmography and it wasn't him! And now I can't find who it was because I can't remember his name. I think I might have just recognized him because he looks so much like Pollux. Whatever, did I mention that Christian Bale was in it?  Tomorrow Noel and I have to lead the Pledge of Allegiance at this thing for Dad. I haven't decided what I'm going to wear yet. Mom thinks I should wear my pink Ann Taylor dress but that wouldn't go with my Chick Flick Cherry nails so I would have to switch them to Italian Love Affair. Or I could just wear my black dress from Express that I wore to Neil's graduation but I'm not sure if I brought that back from VA.

      Did I ever say where I got the name for this blog? It was from Wednesday's BB3 episode where Gerry made an ass of himself and vetoed Marcellas' nomination (whoo go Marcellas!) by saying that his nomination had been racist and prejudiced. He continued to say "I have a black brother-in-law and two beautiful black nephews" to which my brother snarked "I have a sister who is a woman" then Gerry said "Let he who be without sin cast the first stone" (gag me with a sock) and, "My soul is not for sale" Oh Gerry God bless ya for giving a name to my blog but why are you such an idiot?

Maybe someone will take us tomorrow. Well now Noel and I can watch Big Brother 3. Haven't missed an episode yet.   Oh no it looks like it might storm soon. Katie no like storms.

      We met in the dark of night as the city slept. He took me in his arms and we danced as if no one ever had before and no one ever would again. We invented the dance and each step was ours and ours alone. The world could have ended the next day but we would always have the memory of that dance imprinted on our hearts and in the stars above.

      I had the strangest dream the other day. It was the first day of school but for some reason we were meeting at the White House. I had my class schedule and I kept walking and walking and I couldn't find my class. I looked into a window on a door and I saw a cookie sitting on a pedastal. I thought that that couldn't be the room so I kept on walking and then I was at the end of the hallway and I still hadn't found the classroom. I opened a door at the end of the hallway and my mom's cousin Randy was there. I started crying and I said I couldn't find my class and I would never be able to get through high school. Randy said he would help me and he morphed into a short little man with a long white beard that brushed the top of his shoes and gnarled twisted hands. We jumped out the window and onto a rainbow that Randy led to a window. I looked in the window and I saw the cookie on the pedastal again. I said that wasn't my class but Randy said it was so I opened the window, climbed in, and sat down at a desk like nothing had happened.

      I didn't really listen to any cds today. I miss Neil's cds. I'm listening to the craptastic local pop/rock station here only because when I turned it on Weezer's "Sweater Song" was playing. Tonight I'm going to listen to some Bowie, I think. Noel gave me his burnt copy of "Heroes" because he bought a real copy. I must admit that I only like that song because the title track was used in the Elephant Love Song Medley in Moulin Rouge.  Tomorrow Noel and I have to go to this big annual rib fest thing. We hate it. Mom and Dad might take us to Lilo and Stitch- I've heard it's one of the best Disney movies in recent years. I'm a sucker for Disney movies. Alladin and The Little Mermaid can do no wrong.  I watched the most boring movie ever tonight- The Way We Were. It was just like a chore to watch. Despite the fact that I hated it I still cried a little at the end. When Hubble (what kind of a name is that anyway?) asked Katie "Is he a good father?" I couldn't help myself.   This afternoon I watched Roman Holiday. Absolutely loved it. Audrey Hepburn is a goddess. I have a picture of her and George Peppard in Breakfast At Tiffanys on my wall back home. I talked for a while with Sarah on AIM today- the real Sarah this time. She said that she wants to name her daughter Audrey if she ever has kids.   I bought adorable shoes yesterday. I got a pair of Chuck Taylor Converse All Stars in black. I have to head to Hot Topic on Monday to get some cool shoelaces. I also got a super-cute pair of black Nine West cloth flip-flops with kind of a crystal tie back on the strap. And I got some black Nine West heeled loafers (I'm not good at description mmmkay?) to wear to school.

      So Neil is evil   eeeevillll   I say. Yesterday somebody imed me with a sn that I recognized as one of Neil's friends. I thought it was Molly's sn but then the person was all: this is Caitlin. So I had this long conversation with "Caitlin" Then today I asked Neil what Sarah's sn was because I wanted to im her about A Walk To Remember because we had been talking about it. So he gives me this sn and it wasn't the same one that she had imed Noel with. So I said "I thought Sarah's was [insert sarah's   real   sn] Neil was like "um. that's her old one" so I believed him and I imed the sn he gave me. Yeah it was Molly. And it was Molly pretending to be Caitlin yesterday. I can't be mad at him because it was pretty funny. Maybe I shouldn't be so trustworthy?   Ugh I can't sleep. For some reason I ate a Lemon Freeze (read: cup full of sugar) at midnight and now I'm wide awake with nothing to do. I guess it's back to the gwtw fanfic.  Wow, I'm pitiful.  Does it make you any less pitiful if you can admit to being pitiful?

      Kelley is my oldest and best friend. I've known her since, let's see, Mr. Peace's 4th grade Sunday school class. She had just moved to VA from Texas. We hit it right off when I saw that she 1) Had a Nano Baby and 2) Was wearing an American Girl jacket. It was a match made in heaven- we were both huge dorks. She invited me to her house after we had known each other a few weeks and we've been like sisters ever since. Kelley had to move to Oklahoma when we were in 6th grade. Yeah- that sucked dead bunnies through a straw (tm somebody on twop). I missed her so much when she moved- my heart ached for months. I still miss her now but I'm doing better than before. I wish I could visit her in OK but mom won't let me. I wish she would visit me here but she doesn't because want to because I've told her so many times how boring IL is. I know you, Kelley, I know you better than you know yourself so don't think I don't know why you won't visit me. That's okay- I'll always love ya. Now move back to VA already!

      on the phone with Grandma. Mom's Aunt has breast cancer- she had an operation the other day (masemectomy or something) and is waiting to hear from her doctor if it was sucessful or if she has to do chemo. Chemo would not be good for her since she has a heart problem

      A Brief History Of Life by Katie  I was born. I grew up a little and now I'm 14. I told you it would be brief. More? I have two older brothers, Neil who's 18 and Noel who's 16. So I'm the baby of the family- my daddy's princess you could say. Or I say that at least. In the fall I'm going to start high school at a small private school. Neil graduated from there last month and Noel's going to be a junior. I have a weakness for cheesy reality television and I'm obsessed with Gone With the Wind. I also love ER and Trading Spaces. I'll write more later- promise.

      Those bastards! Neil you was robbed! Heh, just kidding. Dude, you can totally get a part in West Side Story. You gotta have confidence. I sound like a complete cheese ball but if you walk into that audition with confidence they're going to notice you. I have to go.. Mom's yelling at me. Love you, miss ya. Talk to you later.

      Wilco was in VA? B-But it didn't list that on wilcoworld.net ! How can it be? I have to go drown my sorrows in some beer. Root beer, people, root beer.  Aah I'm back. God bless Barqs. Don't mess with NYC, whoo!  Went shopping today (are you surprised?) got a super cute messenger bag from Gap with a gift certificate from Grandma. Also got an eyeshadow brush from Target and a craptastic top coat that's going straight to the trash. Oh and I got Glamour because it has a cute picture of Goran Visnjic. Yummy.

      Migraines Bad, Extra Strength Tylenol Good  9 Year Old Girls Annoying  Getting paid for watching Harry Potter Good  I have a weird crush on Alan Rickman. The man is as old as Dad and I find him so attractive. What the heck is wrong with me? It makes it extra strange that I discovered this crush while watching Harry Potter since he's all nasty in that movie with white makeup. But when he plays Colonel Brandon in Sense & Sensibility? Mmmm boy. There's something about the low tone of his voice, how he enunciates his words. Yum.   I? Have money now! So happy. And I'm going to make a buttload (or what I'm assuming will be a nice little sum) cat-sitting over the weekend. With my earnings I'm going to go on a min-spree at Sephora. My top two things I want are the Bobbi Brown Tea Tint and a Calvin Klein Eyewash

      I got a betta fish last night from Nicole. Well- from Nicole's house. Her (well I hope it's a her) name is Ella after Ella Fitzgerald. I picked out the name for Neil's, Coltrane, so I thought I should have a jazz name for mine too. Our cousin's dog is named Mingus... I detect a trend. I was thinking I might just name her Fish- ala Breakfast at Tiffany's.  "Poor fish! Poor slob! Poor slob wothout a name! The way I see it I haven't got the right to give him one. We don't belong to each other."  But I decided on Ella.  Last night we had curry at Caitlin's. It was excellent then but I uhhh payed for it later, if you catch my drift.

      Tonight was so fun. Neil had Sarah, Elise, Bekah, Greg, Ethan, Suzanne, Caitlinn and Gwen over. It was a blast. I'm going to miss Neil's friends sooo much. But Sarah and Bekah will be around and I'll probably see them at school since Erin and Duke still go there. And I'm going to go shopping with Sarah sometime at Potomac Mills which should be fun. Who am I kidding it'll be great. I mean, it's shopping. What can go wrong?   Tomorrow we're having curry at Caitlinn's house which'll be fun, too.   Oh and I'm going to make money next week!! I'm babysitting on Tuesday and Wednesday and then cat-sitting over the weekend.  *sniff* Neil goes to college this weekend. I'm going to miss him beyond belief.

      I had the freakiest dream ever last night.  It started out at my Uncle Frank and Aunt Mary's house but only Aunt Mary was there. Hildi from Trading Spaces kept chasing me around the house and I can't remember exactly but I think Mr. Collins might have been there with the youth group that I used to belong to.  Then Hildi finally caught me while I was hiding in a closet. She dragged me outside into a car that my Uncle Brad was driving (btw U. Brad is on the opposite side of the family from A. Mary and U. Frank) so he drove me to the Girl Scout camp that I had gone to for two years. On the way there I realized that my duffel bag and my backpack were still at A. Mary's house so U. Brad had to go pick them up. So I was at the camp and I recognized a couple girls from my old church.   Then Sarah was there! I don't know why since the camp's in IL but nothing really made sense in the dream so whatever. And with her? This woman who works for the campaign that Mom and Dad have known forever who talks really really loud. So Sarah and Loud Talking Lady said that they would show me to my cabin and that I would be staying with the older girls because I knew Sarah and not with the girls my age (don't ask, I dunno) I say that I'm starved so Sarah says that she'll try to find some food. We're walking down this really dark hallway and in the window there's this Indian guy on a rocking chair writhing around and chanting while people eat. Sarah goes in and comes back morphed into Josh from Big Brother 3. Josh says "There's a crazy guy twisting around in there and doing a hell of a job at it" and then morphs back into Sarah. Sarah and Loud Talking Lady and I walk out of the hallway and they point at this HUGE wasp's nest leaning against a tree. They say that I'll be sleeping there with Sarah and two other girls (at the camp it's always four to a cabin) and then I woke up.  Bizarre.

      Back home. Aaah home. I love being home.   Neil got Johnny Cash Live at Fulsom Prison  Johnny: I was in the arms of my best friend's wife   [normal talking voice] did I hear someone applaud?"  it's great.  I read Breakfast at Tiffany's by Truman Capote and Love Story by Erich Segal yesterday. Today I read a couple chapters of Wuthering Heights. I didn't especially feel like reading much and it was kind of odd.  Neil's sitting next to me on his computer and it feels odd. Like I'm on the computer at the library or something.  I think I need to see Fear Dotcom just because it looks so bad. "It's the last website you'll ever see." Please.  We don't have Evian. I might as well be dead.

      I love staying up late the night before we drive so that I sleep the whole way there. I think this might be the most perfect night I've had in a long time. I'm so happy and I don't exactly know why. Not that I'm complaining. I love to be insanely happy sometimes.

      This Girl Scout camp song has been running through my head lately. We always sang it at the last campfire on the last night and it was always the last song.   OOO, I want to linger OOO, a little longer OOO, a little longer here with you.  OOO, it's such a perfect night OOO, it doesn't seem quite right, OOO, that this should be our last with you.  OOO, and come September OOO, we will remember, OOO, our camping days and friendships true.  OOO, and as the years go by, OOO, I'll think of you and sigh, OOO, this is "good night" and not "good-bye".

      The neighbors here are having a big party. They have a craptastic band playing bad Who covers. It's a crime against the Who. Yeah, they're all sloshed and it's fun to go listen to them. One guy keeps barking. Hee! They had some pitiful little fireworks, too. The sad thing is- this is the best party that's ever been out here.

      I'm crazy jealous that Neil got to Mermaid Avenue first. I was going to get it at Borders but they only had Volume II and so did Best Buy. I think I might have to order it from Amazon but then I would officially go broke. I need a job , why won't anyone hire me to babysit? I'm a good babysitter!   Neil starts school in a week. How is that possible?

      Yesterday was fun. We went to this big Fundraiser thing for Dad at some friends' house (Nada and Gordy). They have a hanger attached to their house that the party was in because it rained.  I served Italian Ice and there were a couple cute guys there- including this one volunteer, Jonathan, that I've never met before. Sadly he's 18 *sigh* I think I picked up on a  little  bit of flirting from these two guys but it wasn't much.  There's a runway right behind the house. After the party Dad, Gordy, and I were in the Nada's VW Bug barreling down the runway. It was beautiful. When we got to the end Gordy said that he would let me drive. Dad thought I shouldn't because I'm only 14 but then Gordy asked Dad when he first drove. After stalling for a while Dad admitted he was much younger than 14. So I tried to drive.. Emphasis on tried. I would have done better if it had been an Automatic but it's a 5 speed so I couldn't really get it to move. We just kind of jerked forward a couple times. But it was still fun.  Just watched The Royal Tenenbaums with the boys.I love that movie. It just gets better and better every time and I always notice something in there that I didn't before. . Neil's either going to call his beta fish Buckley (the dog from TRT) or Coltraine.  Neil got some 50% off any music cd coupons for Borders. I'm going to get Summerteeth with one of them and I'll probably get Being There at the used CD place up in town. Neil said he saw a copy there the other day. *crosses fingers* I hope it's still there.

       Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup, They slither while they pass, they slip away Across the Universe. Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind, Possessing and caressing me. Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world.  Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes, They call me on and on Across the Universe. Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box, They tumble blindly as they make their way Across the Universe  Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world.  Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing Through my open ears inciting and inviting me. Limitless, undying love, which shines around me like a million suns, And calls me on and on Across the Universe  Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world. Nothing's gonna change my world, Nothing's gonna change my world.

      sometimes I feel like I'm a million years old, or at least older than I should be, and I hate that. I hate it so much. I want to be 14. I want to be stupid and shallow and petty. Why won't I allow myself to be 14? Maybe things will get better once I start school- maybe I won't cry all the time.  I think I need to change my template- reading this too much makes my eyes water.

      Man I miss Robyn. Sometimes I can't even think about it or I'll start crying. I joke around with my mom that I only miss Robyn because of the money I made from babysitting Nolan, Ryan, and Jack but that's just not true. I consider Kelley and Robyn to be the two best friends I've ever had. Robyn was like the cool Aunt that I never had, or that I had in Aunt Kim but was never close enough to do stuff with. We were always doing stuff together. I spent more time in Robyn's van than I did in my own for about a year. I could talk to her about anything and she always told me the truth- she didn't pull all that crap that a lot of people do. She's the most outspoken person I've ever known and I love her for that... even though it can be embarrasing sometimes. I think one of the reasons I love her so much is because she's Mom's polar opposite. I love Mom, don't get me wrong, but it was nice to have both of them.  Is it strange that one of my best friends is 30-something and has three sons?

      My arm looks hideous. I've been taking phone messages for Mom and Dad all day long and they run all the way up and down my arm. Not the most attractive look.  Do you ever wonder if you've missed the best time of your life? That you lived it and never knew it? I thought about that a lot a couple years ago but I don't think I've missed it- at least I hope not.  I'm listening to Joni Mitchell's "The Hissing of Summer Lawns" on vinyl. I bought it for two dollars at this great used cd store in town. Nothing beats vinyl, I'm telling you.   I watched  Citizen Kane  this afternoon with Neil and Noel. It was so great- I don't know why I never watched it before.   Why in the world did I volunteer to beta-read the crappiest gwtw fanfic ever? Why do I torture myself like this?! This blathering moron actually uses the phrase "eight-month-pregnant-former-Southern-belle" and every time she means to say "barely" she says "barley" BARLEY! I think that just might be the most annoying thing on the face of the earth. Ugh. I was just reading my first gwtw fic. I really have to rewrite this- it's so bad it's not even funny. I think it's about as good as Timmy and Katherine. I still love the concept of this story and I'm glad that it's not the typical formula for somebody's first gwtw fic. The ending is really abrupt and the main scene- the climax of the story- is just badly written. I'm thinking of revamping it for a contest that someone is holding from my group. The person I'm co-writing a fic with has been AWOL for a while and it's her turn to write a chapter. We've been writing this for months and we're already on chapter 30 but she's just gone. So. Aggravating.  I think I might have to move to Utah:

      I think I might actually win Freshman Rep! Brewster, Elena, and Andrew all forgot to turn in their permission slips! So it's me and Peter P.

      So, yeah. I had a party. Invited all the Freshman. First Kirsten called and said she couldn't come because she had a babysitting job, then Elena called a said she couldn't come because she had a babysitting job, and then Ailsa called and said SHE couldn't come because ... wait for it....wait for it... she had a babysitting job! Oh and then Sarah P. called and said she couldn't come because her Grandparents came for a surprise visit. So I had a party with three people. w00t! Ok, actually it was pretty fun. George, Nick, and Laura M. came over. Laura was only there for a little. Nick and George and I just totally goofed off the whole time, it was great. Only wish more people could've made it.

      You can learn lots of stuff you never knew about people by reading their blogs. Such as that John likes Mitch Hedburg. I love Mitch Hedburg!   Today was just really great. Really really great. It started off a bit blah as I had to drag myself out of bed and to school. Then I found out that I had flunked a History quiz after I took a History test but I think I did a lot better on the test. Dr. V's really nice. He went around the room during the test and gave us all Hershey Kisses. It was just a really nice little thing. Then after the test we went out and drew maps on the parking lot with chalk of Southeast Asia. Our group won. Go us!   So at lunch I'm sitting with, among other people, Anna Frodghy and Lindsey. Anna spontaneously decides that we should roll around on the chalk maps. We had nothing better to do so the three of us just started rolling around. We ended up with multi-colored chalk all. over. us. It was such a blast. Then of course we had to run around hugging people against their will so that they would get chalk on them. Meanwhile Catherine thinks we're total freaks and keeps saying that we're going to get sent home. So then we had to go into school since lunch was over. I saw Mrs. K first and she just kind of stared at me as her jaw dropped. All the girls immediatly screeched "What happened to you?" to which I responded, "Explosion down at the old chalk factory" and walked away as if everything was normal. My first class after lunch was Geometry and Mrs. C just asked if I had had a run-in with the chalkboard. I eventually had to run into Mrs. G (the principal) and all she did was stare at me and ask what in the world had happened. I told her the truth, and she thought it was kind of funny.  It was just a really nice day.

      as expected I got kind of teary in Speech. I didn't do that great- I was starting to cry so I started talking really fast which is a no-no. But I've given speechs before so Mrs. K knew that I'm not normally like that and it was just because of the subject. *sigh* at least it's done with now.

      I'm really not looking forward to Monday. I have a Spanish oral quiz and a Science test. And I have to give a speech in Speech class. All Mrs. K told us was that it had to be a testimony and that it had to include two verses. I wrote about when a friend of ours died in a plane crash and one of my verses is Ecclesiastes 3:4;" A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance." I wish I hadn't chosen to talk about this because I just know I'm going to start crying and I don't want everybody in Speech to see me vulnerable like that.

      I find it unendingly funny that Elise thought I was Stalker-Girl.  In other news, Neil thinks I'm cool which is very nice.   The party was a'ight. It was just me, Noel, Matt, Lindsey, Nathaniel, Duke and Robert. All in all it was better than staying at home for another night. We watched Waiting for Guffman which I love. Then the guys were being.... guys so Lindsey and I watched The Rookie with her mom and her sister, Larissa.  Currently watching a new episode of Trading Spaces. My gosh, everything Frank touches turns to crap.

      I'm thinking I need to branch out with my music taste. I already listen to a lot of music that no one at my school besides Noel listens to (i.e. Tom Waits, Neutral Milk Hotel, Wilco) But I always end up listening to the same Tom Waits albums (Alice and Rain Dogs) and the same NMH album (In an Aeroplane Over the Sea) So what I'm trying to say is that I should take advantage of all the fantabulous music on the computer that I never listen to. Such as the Pixies. Have I mentioned that I love the song Cactus? I only started listening to it because David Bowie did a cover of it on Heathen. I mean, I only got into Wilco months and months after Neil had.  All the Freshman think I'm weird because of some of the things I say (they don't get my humor) and the music I listen to. News flash: if you don't listen to Dashboard Confessional you're a freak. Individuality is highly overrated, pass it on.  George (Drew's brother) is great, by the way. In Old Testament he sits in back of me and we basically just goof off the whole time. He says the most random hilarious things.  Matt W.'s having a party tonight. I don't even know if I'm invited. I don't think any girls are going to be there but I might crash the party. At least Lindsey will be there.

      Old Town is a really neat place. A lot of neo-hippies and intellectual types. I was in this cool little coffee shop where the wall color changes all the time and there were these great flyers everywhere. My favorite was for the National Walk for Breastfeeding.   Went to Pentagon City Mall today. I was looking for a Calvin Klein Eye Wash but I guess the Sephora there doesn't carry any CK stuff. I was bummed so I went to the Stila counter at Nordy's and saw the woman who had done my makeup a couple months ago. She's really nice (everyone go see Yankee (yeah her name's Yankee) at the Stila counter now. Go, I said)  I got an Eye Glaze in Lily, a very pretty purple. And then I went to Nine West and got these shoes in black

      So today was my first day of school. Ever. And it was pretty good, dare I say great. There are a lot of new teachers this year. I have the same teacher for English, Bible and Speech. I wasn't originally going to be in Speech, I wanted a study hall in that period. It was going to be nice, too, since Noel has a study hall then and so do Lindsey and Katherine. But apparently Freshman can't have study halls, I really don't understand that. So they stuck me in Speech, which wasn't what I wanted but I was happy that I wasn't in Art 1. I think Speech is going to be pretty good, actually. My Science teacher, who's also new, is super-smart. She has a phd from Stanford, and used to study volcanoes and stuff. Pretty cool. My Spanish teacher is really funny. I think I'm going to like Spanish a lot.

      I'm going to school tomorrow. I'm going to wake up in the morning and put on my uniform and go to school. I'm going to get a locker and I'm going to put pictures of Goran Visnjic in it. I'm going to sit in a desk. I'm going to take notes. I'm almost crying here I'm so happy. I can't honestly remember a time when I was happier than this. I miss Neil, though. It's strange- we all miss him but we've fallen back in step with our lives and it's like this was the way it always was. Noel and I are a lot closer than before, I think. Of course he'll probably read this and say it's complete crap. But we haven't had a fight since... I can't even remember when.   On Dateline tonight they were having a thing about Fligt 93. At the end they just showed pictures of everyone who had been on the flight. Before I knew it I was crying. I just thought about all the people I know who might've died if it hadn't been for the people on that flight.   Neil- I'm so nervous for you. How'd the audition go? Call me tomorrow, k?

      Two days! Two. Days. TWO DAYS! In TWO DAYS I'm starting school. I can't even comprehend this. So. Excited. It's going to be good, I think. I hope. There seem to be a lot of nice people in my class. I don't really know any of them, though I know some of their siblings. Drew's brother, Heather's sister, and Laura's sister are all in my class. And besides, if I hate all of the Freshman I know a lot of nice Junior girls.  I'm working on my essay about A Separate Peace. The thing basically writes itself but I'm messing it up anyway. I'm not good with compositions where they tell me just what to write. I like to think that I'm more creative than that. Of course the stuff I write that is what I want to write I won't show to anybody because I'm too embarrassed.. There's a story I've been thinking about for a very long time (and no, it has nothing to do with gwtw) that maybe I'll post when I finish it.

      Sorry I'm doing the Friday Five on a Saturday again. I was super-tired yesterday and it totally slipped my mind.   I haven't blogged forever, sorry about that. Not a whole lot has been going on lately- went to see Sweet Home Alabama yesterday with Mom. And that's about it.  1. What is your favorite scary movie?  Oh, hands down,  urlLink Theatre of Blood . It's just the best ever. *snerk*  2. What is your favorite Halloween treat?  Pumpkin Pie. Everyone who knows me knows of my deep, deep love for pumpkin pie. Mmmm  3. Do you dress up for Halloween? If so, describe your best Halloween costume.  I always did dress up when I was younger, I haven't for about two years though. My best costume? Um.. one year I went as a Christmas Present, that was kind of cute. Ok, my costumes suck.  4. Do you enjoy going to haunted houses or other spooky events?  Well I never have so I can't really answer that.  5. Will you dress up for Halloween this year?  Sure. I'm going to be a Private School Girl with a tiara on. Exciting!

      I have no homework tonight except for one (1) workbook page thingamabob for espa�ol uno. I need to find something fun to do. Of course there's nothing to do around here so I'll probably just end up decorating my binder. I'm busy covering my History notebook in Tom Waits lyrics. All the other girls have daisies and stars and such. Maybe this is why I'm ostracized. Hm. Whatever, watch me care. I'm an individual. Yeah that's why there's Pixies and Belle & Sebastian and Neutral Milk Hotel (and the list goes on) lyrics all over my binder.   NMH moment: When you were young you were the king of carrot flowers then how you built a tower tumbling through the trees, and holy rattlesnakes that fell all around your feet. And your mom would stick a fork right into daddy's shoulder.  Hm, maybe I'll cover my Science notebook with The Waste Land by T.S. Elliot.  April is the cruellest month  I don't get why I find the phrase "we will NEVER be out of curly fries" so incredibly funny  And that is officially the most non-coherent blog post I've ever written.  *Cabaret-Liza Manelli*

      Alright I'm going to start doing the  urlLink Friday Five . And yes I know it's Saturday but I'm late to everything.   1. If you could only choose 1 cd to ever listen to again, what would it be?   This question is just impossible. How could I possibly listen to only one cd again? That's like asking me to... I don't know, live without finger-nails or something. If I absolutely had to choose though I guess it would be Being There by Wilco   2. If you could only choose 2 movies to watch ever again, what would they be?   An Affair to Remember because I've already seen it about five million times and I'm not tired of it yet and Legally Blonde for the same reasons. Thought I would say gwtw, didn't you?   3. If you could only choose 3 books to read ever again, what would they be?   Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell, A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith and...... Ethan Frome by Edith Wharton.   4. If you could only choose 4 things to eat or drink ever again, what would they be?   Dr. Pepper, lasanga, Kraft Macaroni and Cheese, Evian    5. If you could only choose 5 people to ever be/talk/associate/whatever with ever again, who would they be?   No way am I answering this. It's just impossible. All I'll say is that two of them would have to be Neil and Noel.

      I haven't written a nice long blog post in a while and I'm feeling guility about it.  Neilio comes back for a break on the 15th! I'm so excited! Man, I miss Neilio. And (this is the best part) he's going to be here on a Thursday! I hate watching ER on my own, it just seems wrong. I think Neilio should go to GMU- it would be much more convenient for me.  Mom and Dad are back in IL for Dad's cousin's daughter's wedding. Christy is staying with Noelio and me. We've been watching cheesy Lifetime movies all weekend such as "After Jimmy" a touching story of how a family copes with a teen boy's suicide, starring Mrs. Lifetime herself, Meredith Baxter. I swear every other Lifetime movie has either Meredith Baxter or Tracey Gold.  Scarlett the mini-series was on cable tonight. Oh man. It's so bad that it makes me ashamed of my deep gwtw love. When I saw it this summer for the first time I wrote out this whole list of why it sucks. I think one of the main reasons was that Joanne Whalley looks like an anemic deer. It's really very frightening. And Timothy Dalton seems to think that slurring words together = a Charleston drawl. Uh, no. And of course they just had to have somebody from Designing Women in there. Long live Jean Smart!  Things are going pretty great (hehe) for me lately. I've just been really happy for a while and I love being happy for no reason.   Tomorrow's a free dress day (i mean a "non-uniform dress day") at school! Yeah!! I'm going to wear my new Milhouse T-shirt. '  Well the house is a mess and Mom's coming home tomorrow so I better go.

      Congrats, Nathan! That is very, very cool.   I had the strangest dream last night. Well, actually it was this morning to be precise.  The whole family was at some big elaborate old theater and we were going to go see Gone With the Wind (I have always wanted to do this) So we're sitting down, waiting for it. And then Owen (this guy in my class) came and sat down next to me with his dad (who once had to let me out of a locker that I had been stuffed into). That was when things got to get kind of weird. It turned out that it wasn't GWTW showing at all but some crap 4 hour long documentary. There would be random movie clips interspersed with somebody talking in a droning voice. This went on for a while. Then the whole family started to revolt. Oh and also somewhere in there I had to go to the bathroom so I got up and realized that I was only wearing my pajama shirt.  Then, and this is really weird, all of I sudden I was watching Lorenzo Llamas selling sherpa hiking boots on some infomercial. And I remember knowing that he was my brother-in-law. And then it cut to Christmas at Uncle Frank and Aunt Mary's house and Llorenzo was there and my mom opened up a box and got some sherpa boots.  Maybe I shouldn't watch Moulin Rouge right before I go to bed?

      I went to see Harry Potter last night with the family and Senator and Mrs. Enzi. Oh. My. Goodness. Too many kids in one place. I thought my head was going to explode. Noel and I sat together and... well, let's just say that it wasn't the best theater for two overly cynical teenagers to be in together. This incredibly annoying boy behind me told me about 50 times during the movie to move because he couldn't see. I eventually turned around in my seat, glared at him, and said, "Look, kid, there's nowhere I can move and I'm not going to sit on the floor. So deal! Heh, that shut him up. Good times, good times. Oh yeah, and then at the end everybody kept clapping at semi-random parts Noel and I of course had to keep clapping at inappropriate parts.  I didn't think I was going to like it but I really did. And I know that the next one is going to be oodles better because it's being directed by Alfonso Cuar�n who directed the '95 version of A Little Princess, which I love to pieces. He also directed Y tu mam� tambi�n. Interesting.  In other news (which will only make sense to Neil and Noel) there was a sequel to Moron Movies, made in 1986 called "More Moron Movies" I think a trip to Blockbuster is in order.

      Bangkok (dpa) - Hungry monkeys have invaded a village in northeastern Thailand, breaking into homes, stealing food and biting the village headman, provincial officials said Monday.   Virat Boontod, a provincial administration official in Yasothon province, said about 500 pig-tailed monkeys had been making frequent raids on Taohai village, 430 kilometres northeast of Bangkok, because there was not enough food in the jungle during the current dry season.   He said the monkeys managed to get inside many homes through windows or by scratching holes in villagers' roofs.   ``They steal chicken and duck eggs and any other food they can find,'' Virat said in a telephone interview. ``Now the villagers are getting fed up with the monkeys. Some of them are using slingshots to drive them away.''   He said one big domesticated monkey was pressed into service to guard an entrance to the village, but it was outnumbered by the simian invaders, who found other ways in.   Last week the village's leader was bitten in the thigh by one of the invaders and had to get rabies shots.   ``The hungry monkeys get some food from local (Buddhist) temples, but it's not enough,'' Virat said. ``We're going to ask for food donations to feed them and we'll ask the district administration to provide a budget for them.''

      I am officially the whitest person alive. Last night I was hanging out at Jewel's party which was at a dance studio. It was a blast! We got kicked out of Giant, danced for ages and then.. I attempted a little white-girl bust-a-move and ended up flat on my back with my right wrist sprained. Poo. Mom and Dad took me to the ER and I now have a fantabulous blue velcro splint. Beautiful!  I'll never dance again!

      Nathan, you are completely right. The retreat was awesome. I can't remember ever having that much fun before in three days. I don't know how someone could not enjoy it (but I'm not going to get into all that right now) I just felt the most wonderful sense of friendship between so many people. When we were all standing around the fire on the second night, I never wanted our school to get bigger. I want to always be able to stand around a campfire, holding hands with absolutely everyone in our school. I got to know so many people that I normally would never talk to and I really got to know my teachers. I wish we had three more days there, of course I might've had to actually bathe then.  Showering is for suckers!

Tomorrow we're going on a retreat and we come back Friday, then we have Monday and Tuesday off because of parent/teacher conferences. Plus, if that's not cool enough, Dad's coming back tomorrow. I haven't seen Dad for like a month!  Oh and by the way, I didn't make cheerleader. And I'm really, really okay with it. For real, I'm not just saying that. If I wasn't ok with it, believe me- you would know :) But I'm seriously okay with it.

      Last Thursday Kelley came to visit. Yay! We hung out in Visiting Officer's Quarters at Fort Belvoir on Thursday, eating junk food and watching Must-See-TV. Then on Friday we went to the White House for a tour to see the Christmas decorations with my family + the grandparents, Nicole, and Mrs. R (Kelley's mom) Then we went to the mall with Neil and Nicole (I got Either/Or by Elliot Smith) and out for pho by....um....the one by us. *cough* Then we went to see Catch me if You Can with Mrs. R. I really liked it. Kelley left on Saturday morning. Saturday night we went out to dinner with the grandparents to the Mount Vernon Inn. The grandparents left yesterday.  Right now we're getting ready for a New Year's Eve party. Fun stuff. And Neil's special friend Erin is coming to visit tomorrow. Mesa so excited!  Well I gotta go buy decorations and make chocolate chip cookies. Mmmm. Y'all better eat them at the party!

      Yeah so I haven't blogged in forever. Let's see what's happened...  On Friday we had Lessons and Carols, a party and then half a day. We gave away Secret Santa presents. I gave Bella  urlLink this . She really, really liked it. I got a cute Old Navy notebook and some matching pencils from...someone. I don't know who it was and it's bugging me. John Kirby got a note saying "Merry Christmas. Have a great day" That's all he got. Hee. And then I got a candle from Sarah Perez and a great decoupage journal from Kaitlynn.  After school, went to see The Two Towers with Noel's Biology class + Duke, Nathan, and Tony. Fun stuff. Ran into George, Nick, George's friend from IBC, Drew, Dan. Then we saw Keegan there with his parental units and forced him to come sit with us Ended up that like 1/4 of the school was there. Good times. The movie was really good, much better than the first one. Every time someone kissed I screamed and went "I can't watch this with Mrs. G!" When the movie let out we ran into Mateo and Lynzi Blanco and Sally coming out of Gangs of New York.  Then we went home and Neil was there with Grandma and Grandpap. They had picked him up at GCC and driven him back. Neil's back for a month, the grands for a week.Yay.  Last night, Dana's Christmas party. Today, Nicole's coming over for dinner. Tommorrow, shopping with Neil then seeing The Two Towers with Nicole and Nate and Robert.

Then after the concert we hung out at the after-party with the Naval Academy Glee Clubs peoples watching this really cool guy making awesome "balloon art" He gets offended if you ask for a "balloon animal" and he loathes children's party because they all ask for weiner dogs and swords. Cool guy.

      Yesterday, went on a field trip w/ Sr. Noyes and Mrs. Cooper up to DC. Went to the Smithsonian Art and Industries Museum. Saw an exhibit on Latin Jazz and then this cool thing about the evolution of Chicano culture. Muy divertida. There was this stupid lowrider simulation, and the guy who talked during it sounded exactly like El Burro from the Diablos. Then we took the Metro down to where we thought this restaurant,  urlLink El Pollo Rico , was. We found a beat up old shack with a tattered "El Po Rico" sign on it. Then we found out that it had moved and we had to walk 8 block in the freezing rain. I had a blast but I was the only one. The food was...interesting, but good.  After school Noel and I went to Lynzi and Mateo Blanco's with Matt H. and Duke. Good times.  Mom and Dad went to Tyson's Corner and when they came to pick us up Mom told me that she had bought me a dress for Homecoming. Of course I expected to absolutely hate it...but it's fabulous. Kind of 50s Cocktail Party atire, which is what I was looking for. It's black with this cool hot pink taffeta underneath.

I think it's unfair to say that Trinity is trying to ruin Homecoming when they are just trying to give us what everyone wanted last year.   Oh and by the way, it's not square dancing, Sarah.

And now a public service message to all current and graduated Trinity students: We need to stop whining about Homecoming. Yes, it's going to be different than we thought but you guys don't know what it's really going to be like. I'm fully convinced that if everybody goes we're going to have an awesomely fun time. A lot of people's feeling are really getting hurt in this whole debate and we need to come together and put an end to it. This is not the end of the world. There's always next year, right?

      Yeah so this week was really great. Got to meet Erin, she stayed here for a couple days. She's very cool. I'm proud of Neil :) The New Year's Eve Party was a blast. Big, big fun. Then we went to a skating party for Nicole's birthday on New Years Day. Also very fun. I'd never been ice skating before. I only fell four times! Go me! After that, hung out at Nicole's house.   Now I'm feeling kinda sick. My voice is completely shot. On the upshot I now sound more like Tom Waits then ever!  Also, I've been watching The Sound of Music in unhealthy doses lately. I only saw it for the first time .a couple days ago. Can't......stop............watching .

      Yay for unofficial snowdays! We got to school today at about 9, found out that there were only 20 kids and Mr. Noyes there and that everyone was watching Mr. Frodigh's Civil War presentation. So Mrs. Crocker told everybody to go home. We dropped Duke and Natalie off at Duke's house, and it took us 20 minutes to get from there to our house. It usually takes about 2 minutes.

      John- I'm gonna defer to Neil because he says it so much better than I ever could.   I'm not dissing John Mayer for being a guy with his guitar and mad affection for his girl. I think he's an awesome guitarist. But his music is not innovative and his lyrics are played. The Grammys should be about pushing the boundaries and being innovative. John Mayer does neither of these.   Avril Lavigne is most definitely controlled by her record company. She's the biggest poser on the music scene today. And she can't perform live worth crap.  And I really do not hate popular music just because it's popular. In fact I don't even hate popular music. Just some.  I totally agree with you on one thing though, John. The Clash tribute was great. Even though I had to put aside my Bruce Springsteen dislike to enjoy it. But that's a whole 'nother story :)  And I completely respect that people have their own personal music tastes and not everyone should be happy. But the NARAS should judge on innovation, and who's pushing the boundaries- not whose albums fly off the shelfs. And sure, some music does get very very popular because it's good. But as I've said Yankee Hotel Foxtrot was a favorite of a huge amount of music critics, who probably know a lot more about music then the general populace (though admittedly there are some critics who don't know what the crap they're talking about)  I don't even care that much if YHF was nominated for the top prize- but Jim O'Rourke should have been nominated for producing that album, because he's at the top of his game.

      I wish NARAS would stop pretending they judge art over sales. The Grammys are a sham and it's ridiculous that Yankee Hotel Foxtrot wasn't even nominated.   Avril Lavigne? Go away. Please.  John Mayer? As they said on the radio today: Art Garfunkel has more testosterone than you.   Seeing Simon and Garfunkel together for the first time in over 20 years was awesome, totally the highlight of the show even if they did both look uncomfortable.  Ugh, gotta go to school now in the first time in over a week. Blah.

       In Case of Emergency, Remain Calm   Yesterday was really, really weird. We had a biological warfare drill in school. In case of emergency we (all 85 of us) have to crowd into the lounge and pee in an orange bucket! Fun stuff! But, as Mrs. Abbot says, we won't have to worry if we're outside. Because we'll be dead. God bless Mrs. Abbot. So during Bible I started writing the preliminary script for "Biological Warfare: The Musical" It's really quite special. Just so you know, Nathan, your big solo is called "Get a Little Closer to Me, Nathaniel" And then you're featured in the big Yatta Dance Number in Act II. Oh, and Drew- I might write you in bringing lunch to George and ending up in the lounge with us. Act III consists of John Brewster being left outside. His songs are "What Happened to My Face?" and "I Thought My Duct Tape Shoes Would Protect Me."

Of course it's not like you're all falling off the edge of your seats waiting for my next pedantic comment. And yes, I'm proud of myself for using pedantic in a sentence.   Well I've been reading a lot lately. Ah, read-a-thon. Gotta love it. I'm ruining my eyes reading thousands of pages, and for what? A lousy savings bond. I don't even get a golden lamp of knowledge, dummit!   Apparently Valentines Day is tomorrow. God bless the greeting card companies for creating a holiday so I can exchange candy and ugly stuffed animals that might resemble a llama with my friends.

Tornado drills are not fun when you have an intense phobia of all things storm-related.  It's hard for me to explain how I feel right now for some reason. I'm happy, I guess.

      I'd like to talk to you all about a subject that's very dear to my heart. That subject would, of course, be the exploitation of Iraqi Information Minister Mohammed al-Sahaf. Let his comments speak for themselves! Do not create your own! Do not make videos with them! You dirty infidels.  Seriously, though. I'm sick of seeing al-Sahaf everywhere. Al-Sahaf is like a delicate exotic fruit; tamper with it and the bloom is gone.  And it's back to school for Katie! Highlights of the day included but were not limited to:  -Mr. Noyes announcing to the entire Spanish 3 class that I'm annoying -Planning the Freshman class production of SNAP! for the coffeehouse -Sleeping through Geometry -Sleeping through History -Sleeping through Bible

I have a couple books I want to read. The Shipping News, Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Absalom Absalom, and a book Mrs. K lent me called My Family and Other Animals. And I need to do some preliminary research on my research paper for History.   Got my 3rd quarter grades back. Did a lot better than I thought I would. Actually got Honors.

I went out and got myself one of them lives that everybody talks about. And I like it!   Okay, I lied. Actually I've been sleeping for the past two weeks. All my teachers are loading on mucho work before Spring Break, plus I'm busy with soccer. We've had three games so far. Won the first one against Ad Fontes (2-1) Lost the second one to Hearts (9-0) and we just won one today against ISA (1-0)  Went over to George's house on Sunday for fun and good times. Now my face is sunburnt and everyone keeps asking me if I've been crying. Grrr.  Have I fulfilled my blogging requirement for the day? Don't hurt me!

On Monday me, Christine, Owen, and Andrew My Huzzy finally performed our three scenes from The Importance of Being Earnest. Must say I'm very glad it's over with and I think we did a good job with it.  Today was Twin/Triplet Day at school. Kaitie McGehee and I made matching t-shirts for ourselves that say "I (heart) aprender del Sr. Noyes" (I love to learn from Mr. Noyes) and one for Mr. Noyes that says "I (heart) teaching Katie and Kaitie" Ahhhh good times. Matt Hayre dressed up like Mr. Kieselowsky. Oh my gosh. They look so much alike. It's ungodly.

      The game was fun beyond all reckoning. Most fun I've had in a long, long time. I spent the whole tailgate party trying to sell candy with George, Kirsten, and Amanda by means of propaganda. Buy Snickers Crunchers and support third world countries!   The actual game was a blast. It's the only game of the year when we're allowed to be horrible sportspeople and trashtalk the faculty. In the last 20 seconds the faculty was two points ahead, but then this middle school kid came out of nowhere and scored a three pointer. Kid's my new hero.  Everybody be sure to rub our victory in Mr. Kieslowsky's face because you know that if he had won, he would've done it to us :)

      Happy Birthday to me. w00t. I'm officially 15 so I can do.....basically nothing.  I'm about to head out to see Finding Nemo with a bunch of friends. Then tonight I'm going to go see Chicago at the National Theater with Neil, Noel, and Nicole.   Missions Trip was grand. I had mucho fun. We spent the majority of the week drywalling and putting up siding and clearing out this old lady's backyard/garbage heap for 30 years. Found some interesting things back there.   Me and Mr. Noyes bonded over the week. He's a pretty cool guy I guess. Had some strange experiences with him, including listening to the Undercover Brother soundtrack together and having numerous ABBA sing-a-longs. Who would've thought he would be an ABBA fan?

      Oh my gosh, I'm dying. I'm so sick and I can't take school off because it's finals week. I think I'm either going to throw up or fall asleep during my exams.  In better news, Dr. Vanderpoel liked my research paper. Awoogah-ah-ah!  We got our yearbooks yesterday. I look yearbook BS, it's the funniest stuff in the world. The description of the Freshman class says something like "The Freshman love to think outside the box, evidenced by the songs that Freshman Katie Manzullo makes up about the workings of our school." Now that would be funny even if I did do that, but I never have! Hee! Oh yeah, and there's the worst picture of me ever on the Homecoming page. Not only do I look terrible but I'm also doing the waltz with George that we made up so I look like a bafoon. Good times, good times. I'm also featured in the part about Speech, cracking up when we're all supposed to be serious.   In other news, I'm going to fail all of my finals with flying colors.   Probably won't be blogging for a while.  Finals week --> All day party at Dr. Vanderpoel's --> Sleeping all day Saturday --> Week long missions trip in West Virginia starting on Sunday  Missions trip is gonna be fun. McGehee and I convinced Sr. Noyes to put us in the same work group. And we're riding the whole way down there and back up in his car. Oh my gosh, he's gonna go insane. That poor, poor man.

      Yeah, so I uhhh haven't posted in a long time. Sorry 'bout that. School is insanely busy. But there's only two more weeks left! Bling bling!  Yesterday was pretty close to perfect. Went to the National Gallery of Art theater with Neil, Noel, and Nicole and met Matt White there. Bling bling. Haven't seen him since he got shipped off to rehab in January. Darn that rehab, by the way. Anywho! Saw the 1926 version of Faust which was surprisingly funny. There was a live musical score to go with it. Very, very cool. I feel like I gained lots of cultured points for this week. After the movie we all went out for Pho then went home. Neil and Nicole headed out for Elise's house so me and Noel and Matt hung out until his mom picked him up.   Seeing him was most cool. I've really missed him. Note to parents: DON'T SEND YOUR KIDS TO REHAB! Especially for an "Unhealthy interest in pop culture" Hehe.   So I actually wrote my History paper today. Bow down before me all you nay-sayers!   Everbody go see Faust. I'll respect you and you'll be better people

      It's official, school's been delayed 13 days. Instead of starting on the 2nd we're starting on the 15th now. I'm not really sure how I feel about this. I'm really anxious to start new classes. Also, this might mean more time in Illinois, which is pretty good actually. I love being here, it's so incredibly peaceful.

      School's going to be so weird next year. Five of my best friends are leaving (whether they wanted to or not) and we're going to be in the new building with all the middle schoolers and elementary kids. Plus, for the first half of the year, we're all going to be in the same wing. It's going to be crazy and I just hope I don't completely hate it. I've really loved being at Providence, it feels a lot more like a really small family there. I'm afraid that we're going to be under a lot more restriction, too. Because Mrs. G was always a really cool principal who let us get away with a lot. But now it's not just her pushing rules and punishments on us- there's going to be Dr. B and Dr. W. And the upper school is probably going to have the most rules because we have to "set the example" for the other kids.   Blech.

       urlLink The Friday Five    1. Do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  I think my  very  first best friend was Kelsey Kieselmier from Illinois. We went to Leaf River Baptist Church together.   2. Are you still in touch with this person?  No. I haven't seen her in at least two years.  3. Do you have a current close friend?  Yup.   4. How did you become friends with this person?  Hmm. Well. We hated each other for half of a school year, tolerated each other for a quarter of a year and then became best friends the last quarter. I think when we really became friends was when I started sending her faux E.E. Cummings poems during classes.  5. Is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? Why?  Kelley. Just because we used to be so close. She was my sister... back in the day.

      I'm darn bored. Today I almost started doing the Math packet for Algebra 2. Yeah, the one I don't have to do until September.   Tonight should be fun, though. We (family + Nicole) are going to the Congressional Baseball Game in DC. We've never been but I've heard it's a lot of fun. The teams are Republican vs. Democrat and they're made up of Congressman and Senators.   Our friends the Terrys, who used to live in our neighborhood and who I used to babysit for, are going to be there. I've only seen them once since they moved back to Omaha. I kinda hope they don't come to the house though. They have three little boys. Three little destructive boys.

      Yay for DVD Rips! I'm currently watching Chicago. So dang L337  Yesterday- 4th of July in DC. Went up to the Capitol with Neil, Noel, Mom, Nicole, Courtney, Courtney's friend Rachel, Sarah, Sam, and the Long's French exchange student Violette. Neil gave a tour. He's pretty good at it. Then we weaseled our way into  the VIP seating section for the concert in front of the Capitol. Yay for Dolly Parton. The fireworks started right at the end of the concert. Surprisingly, the fireworks in Rockford are longer and better.   Worst part of the day was by far the Metro ride home. There were so many people cramming into the train, it was like a stampede. First all 10 of us managed to cram into a train. I've never smelled so much collective B.O. in all my life. Very groddy. But then it turned out that the dang train was our of service. So we had to fit an entire trainload of people back onto the platform. Then all of us except Neil and Sarah got onto the next train. It was pretty bad.   All in all, I realized that Fourth of July in Illinois isn't all that bad after all.

But I know that I can't skip a grade- I'm just not smart enough. Maybe I'm just anxious to start school again....  Had another babysitting job today, same people as Monday. I love those little boys- they're so...chemically imbalanced. The younger one (Johnny, 3) has, um, a lot of rage issues. And the older one (Joe, 7) get's very, very involved in any video game that he's playing. This means hopping around the room, screaming, and swinging the GameCube controller around like it's a sword.  Good times, good times.

      Great article in the Post today. I couldn't find it online, but it's near the end of the Style section. It's about this old curmudgeon in Oregon who never married and lived on this ancient rundown farm in Oregon and shunned all of his neighbors. He never threw anything away, and when he died they found his old childhood toys around his bedroom.   Well anyway, starting in the 60's, kids would bother him (think Boo Radley) and he would chase them off with his shotgun. And when he died, they found out that he was really rich. He had amassed a fortune of about 11 Million. He left all of it to the city so that they could build a youth park on his farm!  It was a pretty entertaining article.   And that's why I love the Post

Why do my friends have the social skills of simians who've been kept in captivity their entire lives? I wish I was back in Illinois. I wish I was back in Illinois. I wish I went to a different school. Why can't people learn what you should tell your friends and what you shouldn't? And why can't I do anything without the whole school knowing? All I want is just one completely nice day with my friends that isn't ruined. And now I think I'm going to throw up.

So I'm taking:  English Honors w/ Mrs. Kieselowsky European History w/ Mr. Kieselowsky New Testament w/ Mrs. Gossard Biology w/ some woman I've never heard of Drama on Mondays and Fridays w/ another woman I've never heard of Algebra 2 w/ Mrs. Case Art 1 w/ Mrs. Dayhoff Spanish 2 w/ Mr. Noyes Study Hall on Tuesdays Wednesdays and Thursdays w/ Mr. Noyes

      We went to the Anderson's Lake Geneva house yesterday. They're extraordinarily nice people and good friends of ours. Their house up there is gorgeous. They're right on the lake and the decorating job is fabulous.   We got up there at about 1:30, talked for a while on the porch (which has a great view of the lake) and then went tubing. I lurve tubing.   Then we came back and had the Great Anderson/Manzullo Croquet Tournament. What I learned: Manzullos don't aim.   For dinner they had a chef come in and cook for us. He's a really nice guy and the food was great. The girl who works for him was coaxed into singing for us by Mr. Anderson. Wow. She has such a good voice. I was very impressed.   Before we left we watched a movie in their home theater and looked at their daughter's wedding pictures in the "gift-wrapping room" (which really serves a lot more purposes)  So I've made the decision that I want to move to Lake Geneva.

Only problem is, the other classes then are English 11, Government 12, and History 9 and I'm not allowed to have a study hall. So, if I can drop the class, then I'm either going to beg for a study hall or beg to be Dr. Vanderpoel's Teacher Aide or something. Matt White's going to be Mrs. D's teacher aide in Art 1 so he can get out of PE.  I would be so much happier at school if I could only get out of Biology, so everybody cross their fingers for me plz!

      Well, we came out of Isabel unscathed except for the fact that we now have no water except for a little tiny bit in the basement bathroom.  We kept electricity all through last night (it might have gone off when I was sleeping though) but the water supply doesn't have power, so there's no water for Fairfax County.  Yesterday afternoon, before the storm came, I told Dad that we should fill up the bathtub in case we lost water. He told me very firmly that we wouldn't lose water.... Bet he wishes we had that bathtub full now.

      Oy vey. School was an extraordinarily tiring experience. There's a lot of changes. A lot. But I like most of my classes (I'm vary wary about Biology), the Drama teacher is a nut like all good drama teachers should be, and MATT WHITE'S BACK! Yay!  The carpool is very stressful, but that'll all get worked out eventually. Driving in with Duke is L337 as always. Noel is in two of my classes, bling bling. I'm doing Yearbook, bling bling.   I never knew how tiring the new schedule would be. Not only is school 45 minutes longer, but lunch is twenty minutes shorter. And there's not even a couch anywhere where I can crash for a minute or two.  And that's all I can muster right now. Bed time for Katie....at 9:30....that's a first.

      Yay for urlLink Clinique's skin care line . I dropped ProActiv about two weeks ago because I think the cleanser is way too harsh to be using twice a day. So I switched to the Clinique line and I think it's really working. My skin feels so much cleaner and it's clearing up.   I'm also thinking of just giving up pop for a while. I know I say that all the time but I really think I'm going to do it this time....Maybe.   I'm really, really, really looking forward to school starting up again. Things are just simpler during school for me. And I need schoolwork to keep me occupied or my mind just kind of....drifts.  I just don't know how I'm going to start waking up around 7 or so. I mean, I just woke up about an hour ago today!

      My room is way, way, way different than it was last week. Pretty much all that's the same is my dresser and bookshelf. I got a new loft bed. It looks kind of like  urlLink this . It doesn't have the dresser or the desk underneath and I took off the bar in front. It's also a lighter color so it matches my dresser almost exactly.  Then we went to IKEA yesterday. The desk I got isn't on the website. It has a white laminated curved top and metal kind of curvy legs.  And I got this stool   and this nifty rolling organizer thing in white    The desk and organizer are under the loft and I sit right outside of the bed on the stool. It's all very leeeet.

      My grandfather has turned into a 13 year old AOLer  First he sent me this hoax about a passage in the Koran:  And I quote: "Quran (9:11) -- For it is written that a son of Arabia would awaken a fearsome Eagle. The wrath of the Eagle would be felt throughout the lands of Allah and lo, while some of the people trembled in despair still more rejoiced; for the wrath of the Eagle cleansed the lands of Allah; and there was peace. (Note the verse number!!!!!)"  I sent him the Urban Legends Page thingymabober that says it's not true and he sends me this back:  "LOL  LOL U could have fooled me since I never read the Koran or whatever. Sounded great tho .Grandpa ;)"  And then my mom told me that he thinks lol means "Laughing On Line"  I love my grandparents

      Funeral Blues   Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone, Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone, Silence the pianos and with muffled drum Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.  Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead Scribbling on the sky the message He Is Dead, Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves, Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.  He was my North, my South, my East and West, My working week and my Sunday rest, My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song; I thought that love would last for ever; I was wrong.  The stars are not wanted now: put out every one; Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun; Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood, For nothing now can ever come to any good.  W. H. Auden

      Me, Drew, and Mr. Fields conspired together to give George a nice new haircut. No more toupee! He might hate us all for a while, but he looks a lot better.  Then George terrorized all the neighborhood children on the Moon Bounce (good job, George!) And Mr. Fields pwned Nick at basketball.   And I watched some Love Hina for the first time. It was...kind of funny

      Two observations on graduating early:  1- I won't be legal to drink until two months after I graduate from college.  2- If I start teaching in a High School right after I graduate, I'll be roughly three years older than the Seniors.  I go between thinking these are funny and thinking they're outright depressing...

      One thing I def. hate about school this year is how hard it is to sit down with Mrs. Gossard. I've been trying since last Monday to get an appointment with her, and I only just got one today. I'm meeting with her on Thursday.  Am I nervous? Yes.  I realized today that ever since I came up with this plan I've been thinking of next year as my Senior year. I just can't really imagine spending two more years in high school. If this doesn't work out somehow, I don't know how I'll do it.

      I just got home from school. I made it through three classes, but I was coughing so badly that I was disrupting all of my classes and I had to have Mom come pick me up.  So it's back at home, watching Starting Over (the best show on daytime tv besides Passions)

      Well, back to school tomorrow. Boo. I can't talk, I cough every five seconds, I really should stay home. But if I do I know I'll fall horribly behind.   Campaigning for Student Senate starts tomorrow. I'm running. w00t. My posters are the L337est. My speech is the L337est. I got my nominations in in record timing.... I hope I win. If I'm going to apply to college with only three years of high school under my belt, I need to beef up on the extra curiculars.  On Friday I went to Dave Marsh's house. It was great. I found out that his next-door neighbor is a girl who I used to go to church with and who was in my American Girl Doll Club. We spent the night talking about said club. I even found a picture of myself in a scrapbook in her closet. George and Dave were bored to death (I think George actually fell asleep) but it was fun to talk to her.  Everybody needs to watch Average Joe, which premiers on Monday. It's going to be the absolute best show ever.

      In case you haven't read it on Neil's blog, I'm planning on skipping my Junior year. I have my parents on board, I just need to talk to Mrs. Gossard about it.  We looked at the Graduation requirements, and figured out that all I have to do is take an English course and a History course through Texas Tech (which is what Erin did)   So next year, I'll take Chemistry with my current class, World Lit. with the Seniors, The Christian Way with the Seniors, and a history class (it doesn't really matter which one I take correspondance and which I do at Trinity) Plus I'll do Yearbook again, and play soccer this year and next year, and an at home PE. All of those classes leaves me with two free periods next year for electives or Trig.  I'm going to apply to Grove City, which would put me and Neil (plus Allan, Nick, Beth, Tallie, Jeff, Etc.) there for a year together.  I was originally planning on applying to University of Illinois too, but the parents only agreed to the plan if I go to a Christian college.   I'm meeting with Mrs. Gossard sometime this week, so everybody send me good vibes that she'll agree.

      Manzullo family reunion at GCC this weekend. Very, very L337.   We came down on Sunday, took Allan out for some terrible food (Elephant & Castle is horrible!), hung out with all the wonderful GCCers. I stayed in Beth and Lindsay's HUGE room on Sunday and Monday night. You could fit three of Neil's room in there.   And that was basically my weekend. Eat, Sleep, Gee.  Oh yeah, and I went to a couple classes with Neil and sounded highly intelligent in Lit Crit. I am the most amazing person alive.

      Over break I've realized that I can no longer read. There's something wrong with my eyes, I'm convinced. I've never been to an optometrist in my life and I always got the chart right at the doctor's. But when I try to read my eyes unfocus or something and it gets all blurry. I used to be able to semi-speed read by reading phrases or sentences by themselves instead of just word by word but I can't do it anymore.   So I've resorted to slowly reading the Cliffs Notes on  Le Morte D'Arthur  and watching hours upon hours of Buffy every day. Yesterday I watched two hours from seven to nine in the morning ("Ted" and "Bad Eggs"), then one on tape around two ("Hushed"), and then two more hours from four to six in the evening ("Surprise" and "Innocence"). And today, since there's not an episode on until eleven, I downloaded the last episode of the series, "Chosen", and watched it twice.   I'm going to start taping the ones that are on when I'm in school and then watching them and the two in the evening in a four-hour long Buffy Mini Marathon while I do my homework.  It's a good thing.

      Thanksgiving at Mom's uncle's house. The Prep School/Ivy League section of the family who we see once or twice a year. Which translates to uncomfortable hugs, a general lack of in-jokes, and large-scale debates on gay civil unions, etc. Plus our biannual literature discussion with our cool second cousin, Jane.  The Ivy Leaguers are pretty leet, especially  urlLink Derek . It was a Multinational celebration, as our other cousin Lee brought a Canadian friend and two Dutch friends.

      The other day, Mom suggested that Noel and I enter a songwriting contest since we "think [we]'re so poetic" But this isn't just any songwriting contest. Oh, no. This is the American Dreams songwriting contest, sponsered by Hillary Duff. And if you win you get to appear on NBC's  American Dreams .   Yeah, we shot that idea down.  It's Thanksgiving morning, so I'm in front of the tv watching the parade as I have every other Thanksgiving of my life. This parade always kicks off the holiday spirit and all that good stuff for me. Amongst the soap opera stars and Bedazzled� drill teams I find comfort in the fact that, in fifteen years, nothing has really changed. I'm not that different from the little girl with bald patches (yay for  urlLink trichotillomania ) and no front teeth who sat on the floor in Illinois watching the same floats and the same balloons.

I feel sorry for Joe, he had to take our Christmas card picture half an hour after meeting us.   So far I've had a thoroughly unproductive break. I'd promised myself that I'd have Sir Thomas Malory's  Le Morte D'Arthur  finished by next Monday, but I haven't cracked it open for a week.  Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

      This week was pretty meh, overall.   Our power went out at school yesterday and today for a couple periods each time. It was cool the first time when it happened during English, but losing power in Yearbook is never fun.  My binder from last year, Old Faithful, died this week. I covered my new one in Chinese poetry- Li Po, Tu Fu, Wang Wei, etc. Noone in my class liked it. What fools these mortals be, sic transit gloria, etc. etc.   I've been writing a lot more this week, though I don't know if I actually like any of it.  I haven't really found my style yet, but it'll come in time.   This weekend seems semi-promising: we're going to Stephanie Ong's birthday party tomorrow, then I plan on taking a day-long nap on Sunday. Good times I'm sure.

      This has been just a great weekend.  I went to Kelly and Kathleen Stone's birthday party on Friday after school and spent the night there. I love the Stoner Twins. We found a bunch of old tapes they had taken from Freshman year and spent the better part of the night watching them. Good times, good times.   Then on Saturday, Noel got about fifteen people together on a couple hours notice to go see Elf. We decided that it's the best movie ever made.   And today I'm just hanging out, sleeping and such. I have absolutely no homework! This is the first time that's happened all year.   School seems a lot shorter with a week-long Thanksgiving Break to look forward to, also.  So,  I'm  happy. How was everyone's weekend?

      Okay, so I have really good news and really bad news.  I'll go chronologically and give you the really bad news first. I had my meeting with Mrs. Gossard and it doesn't look good. They have a new policy that they just came up with this summer that you can only graduate early if you have perfect grades in every subject and all this other stuff. I don't know if I really want to pursue this now, I'm not big on the idea of fighting administration. So, more on this later.  But then came the really good news! We had our speeches for Student Senate on Friday, and then everyone voted and they announced the winner at the end of the day. And I won!! It was so nerve-wracking, I was the last name announced. I felt like I was nervous when I gave my speech and that my voice shook, but everybody (including my Speech class commrades) told me that I did really good. There were twelve people running for four seats, and I was the only sophmore to win. So the Senate is Colin (who's the president), Jennifer Green, Vandy, Matt Hayre, and me.   This week was very up and down, but it ended well.  Yesterday after school, George and I went trick-or-treating dressed up like Viet Cong. Most excellent.  And now I have a bunch of great books to read over the weekend (Collected Sonnets of Edna St. Vincent Millay, a biography of Zelda Fitzgerald, East of Eden)  Times are (mostly) good.

      Last night, went back to the Christmas Eve's of my childhood- Uncle Frank's house. Highlights included when Santa (aka our cousin Joe Tarquini) visited. He gave our cousin Anna a Care Bear, our cousin Joey a toy car, and our NonRelative Amanda a Mike's Hard Lemonade.  My Nana started an antique doll collection for me, Mom, my cousin Mary Kay, and my aunt Mary a long time ago. She bought tons of dolls for us and had them stockpiled in her house. We would all get one every Christmas Eve. Though she died several years ago, there were still a few dolls left over. Last night I opened the last one, ever. And I realized that, though Nana and I were never really close, I miss her so much I can't even express it. And it's not that I miss the times we had together, I miss what we could have had. I miss what Mary Kay had with her.   Well, today we're going to our grandparent's house to see Mom's side of the family. Everyone will be there except for her brother and his family who live in Arizona. This'll be grand, I'm sure, since I love my cousins.   Merry Christmas, guys. I love you all.

      It's Christmas at the Manzullo house! We figured why not open our presents 5 days early instead of 4 days late? I made off with some good loot (including a big ole black leather purse like I wanted, muchos clothes, a couple books, Finding Nemo, and Pirates of the Carribean)  Lessons and Carols was today. I love the band, it's so completely terrible. I hung out and Dave's house with George where I promptly fell asleep on the beanbag chair in the basement. I woke up, drooling, with noone around, wondering where I was and if I had snored whilst asleep.   Aah, living the good life.

      So Christmas is around the corner, which has me thinking of all those fabulous Manzullo Family Christmas Memories.  I feel like every Christmas has been the same (with the exception of last year) ever since we grew up and stopped believing in Santa. And I wouldn't have it any other way. Last year opened my eyes to the fact that I like my Christmas traditions, and I missed them greatly.  I was trying to remember a minute ago when I really stopped believing in Santa. My parents had always told me that he was dead (thanks a lot, parents!), which clearly scarred me for life, but I still managed to believe. I think that it really ended the year Neil and Noel discovered Mom's terrible hiding spot for the presents. She always did wonder why they weren't surprised about the Playstation.  So, when did y'all stop believing?

      Well, this week has been grand. Three snow days in a row. It's a beautiful thing. I think every weekend should be five days.   Of course this'll probably mess up the ski trip, homecoming planning, and any chance of going to Camp Highroads... but I don't seem to care.  Oh yeah, and Read-A-Thon started yesterday! I'm kind of obsessed with Read-A-Thon, in case you didn't know. I read 500 pages yesterday and a couple hundred more today. There's a  massive  stack of books next to my dresser that I'm ready to plow through.  Life is (for once)(surprisingly)good.

      As I studied for my Biology test tonight,  Tru Calling  (Eliza Dushku's new show) came on. Lacking the energy to jump off the loft in order to retrieve the remote, I allowed it to play in the background. And then, all of a sudden, I realized something interesting. A half hour into the show they actually said "earlier on Tru Calling" and they showed a recap of the first half hour.   And all I could think was, in the immortal words of Ben Walker (or was it Joe?) "ARE YOU CEREAL, MAN?"

"It will not be denigrating to the Amish."    Hopefully this won't turn out like the documentary  urlLink Devil's Playground  which featured a Preacher's son who became addicted to, and eventually delt, crank.

Besides which, how are they ever going to find an Amish family that agrees to this?  Oy vey, Les Moonves is a psycho.

       urlLink Oops she married a friend.    LAS VEGAS - Pop star Britney Spears married a childhood friend from Louisiana in an early morning ceremony, but quickly arranged to have it annulled, a source close to Spears told The Associated Press Sunday.   George Maloof Jr., owner and operator of the Palms Casino Hotel, confirmed that the 22-year-old singer married Jason Allen Alexander about 5:30 a.m. at a Las Vegas wedding chapel.    "Nobody knew it was coming," said Maloof, Spears' good friend.    A source speaking on condition of anonymity told The Associated Press that Spears was a "little stunned" about getting married to Alexander but was not drunk at the time.    The source said the two arranged an annulment Saturday afternoon in the presence of several people, including a Las Vegas lawyer.    The signed annulment will be official when the courts open Monday morning, the source said.

      Well here it is- an actual blog post. Happy, Nick?  I know I've been neglecting this blog and all of you in general but life does have a tendency to happen, whether I want it to or not. And so very much has happened lately that I cannot possibly recap it all. But I'll try.  Things that have consumed my life include but are not limited to:   Getting off of academic probation. This one wasn't easy but I  finally  accomplished it on Friday! Go me!  Read-a-Thon. I don't know why I let myself get so caught up in something so silly. But hey, I got some wonderful prizes. There's the maze pen, the Twix bar, and hey- that University Theater gift certificate. That's a whole...two dollars there.  American Idol. urlLink She bang, she bang, oh oh she move, she move.   Yearbook. Due date? March 22nd. Eep! I've logged so many hours in that room these past two weeks. There were two work days from 3 to 7 on Tuesday and Thursday and two more this Tuesday and Thursday. (I love deadlines. I especially love the whooshing sound they make as they fly by.--Douglas Adams)  Various and sundry other crap.    I'm only happy when it rains  I'm only happy when it's complicated  And though I know you can't appreciate it  I'm only happy when it rains   You know I love it when the news is bad  And why it feels so good to feel so sad  I'm only happy when it rains   Pour your misery down, pour your misery down on me  Pour your misery down, pour your misery down on me

      Guess who got their permit?  :)  That's right, Virginia. I'm driving. Just in parking lots and neighborhoods so far, but I have only had it for a day now.   Yeah, that test? A bit harder than I thought. I got 4 wrong!! There was this one gay question that was like "What percentage of car crashes are caused by drunk driving?" So I said half but the answer was a third! Seriously, folks. What's with the test?  But I got it and the picture is actually good. I know, it's insane. The best part however is my signature. It looks like a five year old wrote it. I'd never signed one of those electronic things before and the light was weird so I couldn't see what I was writing AND the little window wasn't big enough for my full name so was like writing on top of myself. It's really sad.  On a different note: Coffee House is this Friday so everybody should come. It's going to be tight this year, I swear.   And the Student/Faculty game is Saturday. It's going to be a great (but stressful) weekend.

      Life has def. been of the crazy lately. Ye old book of the year was supposed to be due  today  but those crazy Jostens folks still haven't sent our class pages back. So the deadline is hopefully next Friday but it might drag on into the next week. Good: we can cover Coffehouse and the Student/Faculty Game. Bad: I'm working the coffeehouse and me and Jen Green are running Senate concessions for the game. So I really wanted the yearbook to be over and done with.  And now I shall enlight you about the recent goings-on at TCS. The Great Huzzah War of Spring 2004.  It all began many a week ago when the Junior Bible class (under the command of one Dr. Vanderpoel) took to interrupting the Sophomore Bible class (valiantly led by Mr. Pridmore) with cries of "Huzzah!" from across the hall. These vocal outbursts soon escalated and they began marching into our room and giving half-hearted Huzzahs.   The Sophomores, never ones to sit idly by, responded by constructing an arc (of the covenant variety) out of a cardboard box as well as various and sundry odds and ends. The lovely thing is adorned with a pipe cleaner archangel and bears the countenances of the two dueling Bible teachers on either side. We marched around the Junior's Bible room 7 times, blew a trumpet three times and gave a hearty "Huzzah!"  The above event transpired last Friday. This Monday a special delivery was made by Mrs. Smith. It seems a rogue group of rebels had stolen our arc. Included in our delivery was a picture of the entire Junior class around the arc with bandanas or History books over their faces. And Dr. Vanderpoel holding that day's Washington Post. Also, a ransom note demanding Hostess products, M&Ms (orange only) and Dr. Pepper. If the ransom was not paid by 8:10 A.M. today the rebels sincerely hoped that our "pagan box" could swim.   The Sophomores unanimously decided that we would not deal with terrorists. We quickly found the arc in Mrs. Gossard's office and took it back on Thursday. It was safely (!) hidden in Mr. Pridmore's truck. However, that same day, Dr. Vanderpoel combed the entire school and the surrounding area and re-stole the arc!   Due to a series of events that cannot be disclosed here in the interests of Sophomore Security, we reclaimed our arc. The juniors are now the proud owners of: 1 picture of the Sophomore class consuming Hostess products, M&Ms and Dr. Pepper while holding our arc,1 box of empty Hostess wrappers and boxes. They received these wonderful items during a ceremony involving another lap round the room with our precious arc.  The pictures are phenomenal and I'll do my darndest to get them on here at some point.  For now we wait, and plot. And learn about the New Testament of course.

We saw the Beatles' exhibit at  American History and  urlLink Douglas Gordon at the Hirshhorn.  George came over after dinner and we attempted to watch  Something's Got To Give  with the parentals but it was pretty awful. So we went for a walk but my parents thought we were just in the gazebo. We were sitting on a park bench talking when my dad goes by in our van! Search party...nice. But they aren't mad or anything so George is still allowed in the house :)  I watched the latest episode of  The Apprentice  twice. Oh my goodness. This, my friends, is great television. Best.

It was the perfect start to Easter Break. Today we went to see my cousin Tom's marching band at Arlington National Cemetary. It was really windy which resulted in about half the music being carried off with the wind. But they were still good.  Should be a grand week. Only downside is that my best friend is gone. I'm so sorry, George and Drew.

      Blah. Bad day.   I was up last night at three because I didn't feel well and then at five because of the  huge  thunderstorms.   So I get to school, feeling absolutely horrid already and find out that, instead of Yearbook, we had a  two hour biology class ! We've been having a class during study hall every other Wednesday to make up all the days we missed but I completely forgot.   My apologies to any eighth graders I may have snapped at during carpool. But talking about whaling reaaaaly isn't the way to cheer someone up :)  And now I'm watching the American Idol finale. Can you feel the pageantry, people? If Diana wins, I'm going to go out into the street and throw something. My own little mini-riot. Ooh they're doing a medley with Diana, Fantasia, Kelly, and Ruben. Wow, Kelly's wearing a really sparkly...bra? That's certainly interesting.

I went on Flight of Fear AND Volcano AND Hypersonic! This is from a girl who had only been on the Grizzly before! Neil got me through by promising me Slurpees. However my Slurpee reward was seriously gross. Very melty and bad. Quite dissapointing.  Yesterday I went to Duke's house for swimming, burgers, and Matchstick Men. Good times resulted.

       School's out for summer School's out forever School's been blown to pieces   I finished up exams on Thursday, after which I went to a Sophomore (now Junior!) party at Aly's house. Many good times resulted including George falling flat on his face multiple times, seranading a bag boy with "A Mighty Fortress is Our God", Alex proposing to a cashier, and singing "Happy Birthday" to a police man, and Spencer grinding his feet into my head yelling "Buy a new couch!"  So I spent the night there with Amanda, Laura Jones, Aly and Kathy and went to school the next morning for the final chapel/awards ceremony. I got the ybk staffer of the year award! My grand prize?    52 ounces of Slurpee goodness!  So that was really really cool. Then I went out to Wendy's with a bunch of the Seniors err "graduates." I'm not gonna get used to calling them that.  And the girls' lock-in was last night. Very fun. Would've been better if  some certain people  had showed up. Anywho- the summer's here and I can barely believe it.   My aunt Kim and her family (all six of them) are coming to visit for a while on Monday. I'm kind of wondering how they'll all fit..  Well, back to sleep.

And now, as a member of the Class of 200 6 , I'm going to go study for finals!

       urlLink The New York Times > Movies > Movie Review | 'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban': An Adolescent Wizard Meets a Grown-Up Moviemaker   Saw the new Harry Potter last night with Amanda, Aly, Noel and the parental units.  I loved it!  Best one so far- without a doubt. The review above says it better than I ever could. Anybody want to go see it today with me?

       Hey, everyone! I bet you're wondering- What has Katie been doing for the past week? Well I've been playing Zelda! It's the best game ever. And I went to GMU to see Jurassic Park, Casablanca, and The Wizard of Oz. I'm probably going to Ghostbusters tonight. Yay! Last night was Rachel C. and Kirsten's birthday party! I got to see all my lovely TCSers.  I miss everyone so much. *tear*    Well the family (minus Neil) is going back to the Land o' Lincoln on Sunday. I'm looking forward to getting some fabulous food at the restaurant, campaigning, watching our three tv channels, dealing with dialup, going fishing with my uncle possibly, and doing my summer homework of course.    I miss Senor Carl :( The Bouchards are fish-sitting him while I'm gone.

      So I went over to Sam's house yesterday with Alex and George to burn George's binder (A.K.A Hell) It burnt surprisingly well. The bottle rockets flying oh so gracefully off of it were awe-inspiring indeed.     So- who wants to go see Casablanca on the outdoor screen at GMU on Monday? Give me a call.

      My life for the past couple of weeks has involved:  -Watching copious amounts of urlLink  Arrested Development,  also known as the best show on television. Seriously! When  urlLink FOX  announced that they were bringing it back for a second season the critics gave it a standing ovation! So I've watched every episode at least once but most twice (or three times...) It's genius, I say!  -Going to  urlLink Driver's Ed . Yeah, that was a hoot and a half. I finally finished yesterday. I got an A. Yeah, go me.   -Seeing  urlLink Anchorman  (amazing) and  urlLink Dodgeball  (awful)  -Debating with  urlLink Jonny  about  urlLink Catholicism.   -Avoiding my  urlLink summer packet .

       urlLink    Check it out. This is Señor Carl "Annyong" Weathers. He was my birthday present from Miss Amanda Melissa Bouchard- my translucent best friend. Señor Carl enjoys watching Arrested Development, listening to Appalachian folk music, and bamboo. He dislikes having his picture taken, not being fed, and being attacked by errant bamboo roots.
