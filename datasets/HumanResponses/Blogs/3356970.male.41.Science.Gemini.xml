      Are you a Borg? Do you want to be a Borg? What would becoming a Borg do for you?  We are all to some extent becoming Borg. Some of us more so and faster then others but in they end we will assimilate you. Some of us depend on our technology to survive, some to keep from getting lost others to keep from getting bored. (Bored, not Borged!) one of my friends at work who would not consider himself Borg has 2 cell phones a beeper and a PDA. Is he Borg? Maybe not. I have my PPC, cell (Bluetooth connection both always on) my TENS and my GPS (not yet a Bluetooth model but soon, I will give the old one to a friend when I get the new one.) Not only that but I am developing my own HUD and will probably convert that to an camera/HUD as soon as I can. some people have technology but use it little, others of us depend on them. I go camping and take solar chargers for my computer in my drybag.  So what do you have that may or may not make you Borg? Are you?

      I just watched Truely win the Monaco F1 and then left where I was watching it, jumped into a vehicle with 300 HP and this is not a good combination. Smoking tires and sliding corners I decided that running around town at 60+ might attract attention and I pulled it in a bit.  Of course being borg I knew the speed i was going and where i was due to my always there GPS unit. Borg never get lost, we use electronic bread crumbs. LLAP

      My sister-in-law got a virus on her computer today. Well it's been there a week or so but I took the time to ID it today. I got to thinking. What if my newly connected computerized life support system (I use wearable medical devices that I have connected together and to my pocket PC to make controlling them easier and well the PPC is wireless to the net all the time) What if they got a computer virus, or a virus that infected my PPC made them go haywire. Not a pretty sight believe me. I have an antivirus software installed on all my connection points but not on the PPC; not enough mem to put one. One more thing for a Borg to think about.

      I am sitting here typing into my computer when I could be just dictating it, except the voice control for computers is just not there yet. I would like to do this with my pocket PC but it's not even ready to take commands yet.There is the new Voice Command for Pocket PC but with only 128 meg of ram and no hard drive having enough storage space for the software and the tables and pattern analysis software is not going to fit. On the PC you can  do some with Microsofts new voice command SDK. But the recognition rate is lower then the rate on my 10 year old Mac. For now the part of a borg that listens is still the biological part.

      Yes you watch Star Trek and you know what a Borg is. Are there any actually living wth us? Not the TV type but there are a ton of people who i consider to be real Borg.  The word Borg is a shortened form of the word cyborg which is a just a person with non-organic parts. These parts must augment the persons life in some way such as a person with a pacemaker is a borg because they have an embedded device that keeps them alive. (If that is not an augmentation of their life them what is?) I am a borg because of my use of electronic devoces to control pain. I use a tens machine all the time. I also have other devices I use all the time such as my pocket PC and other devices in my Personal Area Network (PAN). I believe there are a ton of us out there and we need to gather the collective via the internet and hopefully we can do this by using blogs and IM. \\//_ LLAP .||.

      Hi, I am in the process of moving my blog here from another site.  I am not moving all of the posts here but will start fresh and hopefully I can get a better more mature audience here.

      Yet again another on-line attack by a group from Russia. This time a triple whammy on the Microsoft front. It starts with an unknown IIS (The microsoft web server) security hole that allowed the group into a ton of internet sites to add code to the sites web pages. This added code downloads a trojan program onto your machine if you are using Internet Explorer (the Microsoft web browser) and this Trojan is so new none of the virus checkers catch it yet.  So advice people, move away from IIS if you are hosting web pages because this is a zero hour attack on you If you are just someone browsing the web move to a browser that is not based on the Microsoft browser or better yet to a non Microsoft Operating System.  This will not guarantee that in the future you will not be attacked again just that right now the bad guys are only paying attention to the Microsoft world.  ysrd

      Well it was a blowout, and YSRD is again the world champ. We had everytool you can think of and all major firewalls and OS combos you can imagine and Every root password of the target servers and all contestants falling to the champ.   the contest is based on the hacker being able to get into the system without getting caught by any honey traps and IDS software and get the holy grail of hacking, the root password. This involves finding and exploiting any hole in the system and then cracking the native mode root or administrator password and ten announcing their ability by changing a file or web page on the server and doing so while the owner is on the machine and possibly seeing you do the damage. Secondary is protecting your own system while you do this to every other machine on the network. With 6 native servers on the network (the targets) and from 4 to 20 people connected at once trying to do the same thing to you. Winner take all, getting all root passwords is an automatic win.   This year we added wireless and Bluetooth segments to the network and had people using Mac, Intel, Palm and PPC systems. It was a ball and one of the only safe hacking forums left with all contestants and participants signing wavers to allow hack attacks while connected to the network. (All legal and fun.) The main goal is to show that no system is completely secure and to show the participants (mostly 500's employees and administrators) how they can be attacked and to possibly show them how to defend themselves and protect their IP.  Even Ysrd learned a trick or two and everyone went away with something they could apply back at base.  I had a lot of fun as did everyone who attended. Best newcomer was a 13 year old girl (accompanied but not helped by her dad) and she shows a lot of promise as well as an enthusiasm and focus that many of her older peers could learn from.  Best firewall is a new comer that is not yet released, brought by it's creator in an attempt to stop the champ. Watch for him to incorporate what he learned and make a remarkable firewall that can stop anything thrown at it. Running on a new OS that will be released at the same time keep an eye out for "the Moat(tm)" to be released in early fall.  New Ideas for next year (or earlier if we can get together again) are tunnel and VPN hacking. Happy hacking but keep your white hats on,  YSRD

      It's that time of year again, and we are setting up the newest and greatest of Windows, Linux and Macintosh firewalls, ids and day after pills to see how fast they will fall, it hackfest 2k4. Hey isn't this what having your own network is all about? You thought it was to keep people out of your machine. Hell no, you want to keep someone out you don't connect (that's what we do, all the important stuff is never connected.)  But for the duration of the fest the network will not be connected to the internet to keep prying eyes away from the festivities. Nope we are not even leaving a beacon up if you want in you have to be here by 9:00 am and BYOB.  We have 5 servers up and running on the network already and we are setting up more. Guests are to bring their own computers and cables. Don't bring anything you can't afford to lose guests computers are open targets as are the servers. Points awarded for speed and finesse; anyone getting all root passwords scores an automatic win. Judges decision final, prizes as always: the admiration and acclaim of the best of the best of your peers. \\//_  LLAP .||.

      OK you've just got hit by a virus or youv'e been hacked or someone in your company has just deleted all f your files or , well your not sure are you. Want to be sure? Today i find on the net  a set of tools that can help you answer those questions (and more) and they all come on a single cd that you don't need to install to use. pretty good eh?  Yup another Knoppix disk is out and thids time it's the security tools distribution.  If you have to watch over a file server that might get attacked or if you are a web master or a security firm in the making this is the tools you have been looking for. There are all kinds of tools from intrusion detection (IDS) to forensic analysis of a dea hard drive. And it's all Open Source. Right, GPL mostly and free for anyone to use. Yes people can use these tools to cause trouble but if you now how to use them you can stop them and catch them as well. Each set of tools of a given type is grouped together in the directory structure as well as the menu structre in the windo manager. Very cool layout and every grouped directoy has an RTFM directory so you can learn how to use the tools included. Well thought out and based on top of one of the best bootable distributions out there it's one tool I will keep in my tool chest. ysrd

      We sort of lucked out the other day. We went garage saling last week (not sailing, saling) and I picked up some remote Control toys including Malcolm the robot. Not much really just a motorized base with remote control and a blow up robot balloon on top, but with the addition of the remote controlled car and other parts we have the ability to create something more. His moving about is handled quit well with his own wheeled base for what we want to do with him but we will have to add a more useful bot on top with more brains then just hot air. (Some of our foliations are getting by with the latter but this is the real world not politic so the blowup is probably going to go away unless we can make it a bit shorter and add stuff to it. I am looking TA using an old Pentium 133 as his onboard brains with sometype of wireless networking like bluetooth to connect him to the closest network or even my PAN. Next thing is to figure out what we want him to do so that we can then program him. I have a robotic arm here from an old project that I will be adding to him. One arm for now, might leave one of the blowup arms in place as well as the head and pat of the body.  ysrd

      You may have or may not have noticed that i do not bash Microsoft. I am a Linux user but I believe in using the best tool for the job and there are times that is (ahh don't make me say it) Windows. I use a windows powered Pocket PC for my always at the ready and always in my pocket computer. I also use their compiler and IDE for writing apps for the PPC. I use Java and Linux for development but lately I have been using WebSphere Studio on a Windows 2k box for java dev. So when I hear that MS is putting out a bunch of free lite versions of their development products I take a look. I have argued for a long time now that if the basic tools for developing for one platform (ppc) are free why can't a basic set of dev be available for another (desktop Windows) at least for the guy sitting at home about to have the next big idea. If putting the development tools into his hands means your platform is the one the next big thing sits on then your platform can see clear benefits. So here's what i have so far. The sql server and web page tool are already available. They are cut down free versions of the real thing. The others (vb.net, c#.net, c++.net, j#.net are all coming soon if not already. These are for " hobbyists, enthusiasts, and novices"  At the moment they are only in Beta 1 and are free to download but they say you are not licensed to distribute the results. The web page indicated that in the beta 2 stage there will be some type of license to distribute. Anytime something is free it is a good thing but with the you can't distribute thing in palce I am suggesting people who have studio to stay with it, if you want to start to learn how to develope then the beta one may be ok for you to try out programming (use the j# to start is what I suggest) and then move to c# and c++ If you alreadt program in VB moving to the express version will leave you wanting. Another thing I noticed is that they are trying toi keep the sizes down so if you are using an older computer this may be what you need. Only 50 meg HDD space required and the other specs are loose as well.  ysrd

      What kind of Borg are you? I consider myself to be a wireless Borg but I do have to hook up so to speak once in a while to do large data transfers and recharge batteries. What the heck am I talking about? Well you see as a Borg I have wearable electronics including my Pocket PC, cell phone and medical devices. I wear a tens machine when I need to and have the PPC and cell with me at all  times. I am "connected" able to read my email, surf the web, view information, work on work and all that stuff wirelessly by using the celphone and my pocketPC wirelessly. The two have Bluetooth so they can talk, I have a ton of music on the ppc as well as the other stuff (including the PADD and a rudimentary tricorder.) All of these machines use batteries, which I have to recharge.  Some people are wired borgs, they have to carry a power supply or be plugged in to communicate. These include the older but still prevalent laptop borgs and people on kidney dialysis. Don't get me wrong I do have a laptop as well as dektop computer systems but the computer I always carry is my PPC.  How does life as a borg make my life better then the normal non-borg varient human? I use my technology to augment my human tools. I can't think faster by using it but I do have more information to make decisions on. I am able to control the pain from my medical problems. I am able to remeber things I couldn't before (such as people names and phone numbers.) Soon I will be able to see better with the edition of a heads up display and computer augmentation of what i see.  With the increase in computing power and the ability to connet to my home computer network I can use the collective power of those computers from anywhere I can connect by bluetooth or cell. Life is good.  ysrd

      here we are sitting, me and my son and we are listening to our fav songs, Thousand foot crutch and SCC.  I spotted a book on my shelf, "The Formal Logic of Emotion". Nathan found his fav book his colouring book from SK. We are looking at the remains of a robot as well and pondering it's future. Another fin saturday night.

      After looking at the latest virus code and at the fact it was a triple threat (used an unknown and unpatched hole in IIS two holes in IE, one unknown the other unpatched and was a completely new and undetected Trojan) is it time for people to finally understand that staying with Microsoft is a loosing proposition? How many people finally got the idea that since IE is the most used it is the most targeted? The question though is of the 15% of the internet that downloaded Moz or one of it's variants are going to stay with it? And how many will take the plunge and switch to a Mac or Linux? And will the virus writers move with the people?  I for one think that most people will stay with IE Windows and BG. That will be enough for the virus writers to stay with MS and the rest of us can get on with our lives and making money by fixing the computers of the 95ers.  Another thing, I know I'm from Canada but does that mean that the Microsoft executive emails have to be in French? I don't speak French, I speak C, C++, java, php, VB (and Asp but don't tell anyone), Pascal, Ada and Fortran but not French.  YSRD

      My neighbour's kid is getting married and because we are so close to them we are up to our ears in it. The latest thing is the photog called and won't be able to get there so the borg to the rescue. With the latest eye cam and a good connection we will be recording the wedding to disk across the net (as well as using the 35s and hi 8 vid.) Got to go get film and batteries. I use 35 still because even with my best camera you don't get the clean picture you do with analog.  ysrd

      My freind gave me an old broken lcd screen for a security system. i am trying to fix it and then see what I can attach it to. I am thinking some sort of display for a robot. it's 12 volt, and stabdard tv signal. (NTSC) Should be a fun project.
