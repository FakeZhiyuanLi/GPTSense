      wassup! my poor neglected blog. well the thing is i do have a life so cant be dedicating all my time to this thingy. 1st wk of sku doing a2 stuff. pretty cool. vectors in maths is bad news. ya. n i got frees for the first time in my life coz now i dont got french. thats cool. doing decline and fall for lit. other texts r wide sargasso sea, emma, and anthony and cleopatra. sounds interesting. read wide sargasso sea yesterday n its thoroughly depressing. made mbr scream today. was cool. went to buy a dress for grad ball aka prom on wednesday. cudnt find any decent dresses so bought a girly top n jeans. will wear some killer heels. its 2moro. n asked dad this morning bout staying out after midnite n he said ya after lots of asking. n ya today mom locked the keys inside the house so we cudnt get in til dad came home at like 5pm. sad. sat bored to death in the stinky restaurant. damn. tried to call lng dunno how many times today. no one picking up. hmmm... wat else. damn my left contacts going fuzzy again. its got serious issues. checked out pt of the rehearsals for grad ceremony. then went back to common room to mess round wit mbr. pretty good. theres beef in the air. damn. been on the phone for the past over an hr. actually, correction. not much beef in the air i think. must be over exaggerating. well everythings pretty messed up n disorganised for the grad stuff. mad. ya. we'll see.

      jus did a lovely post. short n sweet. but now, due to some funky computer glitch, its "being ever dissolved in wan wistlessness". how sad. well ya. was summin like this.   ***  title: and now im back  from outer space. well not exactly from outer space but watever. didnt have internet last nite. was really dead n stuff. weird. got a span to write but wanna read evelyn waugh, decline and fall. jus got it today. also pretty discrouraging that i havent had any profile views since sunday. but its cool. im doing this for ME. so as long as i keep on checking my blog n adding stuff to it. ya.   ***  well that was an attempt. cant possibly capture the spirit of the original. sigh, my work of art is now forever lost.

      now i think this is wat i had forgotten, not the xiaoyi stuff in the last post but of course i had forgotten that as well. was jus wondering when if ever im gonna get a comment on my blog. i'd be really chuffed if u do get a comment tho, even if its insulting me or wateva. at least i'd know that im not the othly person who's seen my blog. of course i cud give the addy to some friends but nah thats a bit hmmm... dunno if i'll want them to read all this stuff. well it wudnt matter coz i mean anyone can find this thingy but it would be pretty embarrassingas i've already said. ya.

      hey how some i searched google for "the wonderful world of summin" and no results came up. nothing for xiaoyi87 either. is it coz my blog is a standalone thingy with no links to it or summin? or is it too new or summin. how weird. will be searching google regularly to check up. oh ya. shud also use other search engines. oh ya n this is SO not cool. xiaoyi is always taken up as a username. even for like hotmail n yahoo n stuff. really frustrating having to append numbers n i really dont like adding numbers to stuff but what else am i supposed to do? i love my name. hey now i wonder wat its gonna take me to get a gmail account. maybe like active users r defined as having loads of interaction wit other bloggers n not jus posting a span of stuff. but even if thats the case n i dont get gmail coz i certainly dont have enough time to network wit other users n probably theyre not at all interested in my blog i guess its ok coz writing here is pretty cool. eesh that was a confusing sentence. really good if i can build a huge collection of posts n compile a book or summin. of course no chance of it getting published but jus summin cool. a family heirloom or summin. lol. could be worth a few bucks a thousand yrs form now. u never know. anyways so my original purpose for this blog was to get a gmail account. but this seems now highly unlikely but its cool. yahoo mail got 100mb. but still. its cool to have @gmail.com. well guess i'll jus have to wait for it to become available to the public. but really hope my names not taken. that wouldnt be cool. us africans r always at a disadvantage. now i wanted to say summin else but i forgot. typical.

      i mean yo i chose this tmeplate coz it looks good but it doesnt have any space for links. but i wanna put in some links. HELP!!! anyways now im bout the go off topic but hey who cares this is MY world n i can do wateva i want. ahhh..... a nice boost for the ego. really hope i get to watch hp3 2moro at arcades. really really really need to watch it. and then probably when it comes at metro 2 i'll watch it like 3 or 4 more times. and eesh now im wondering if i shud b tking bout other ppl in this blog thingy. i mean isnt that bad for their privacy? maybe i shud make up some codenames or summin like that. ya. good idea. well not really. eesh man if im gonna be writing in this thing, writing longass emails to 2 ppl, what the hell am i suppsoed to write in my diary? havent touched that thing properly for a LONG time. wrote like a sentence on 14th. that took lots of effort. fell asleep n then when tz called i forced myself to scribble summin b4 the 15th dawned. now i really gotta give this blog some kinda direction. like a cause to get really passionate about. but what?! coz not exactly like i can use this to record watevers happening in my life. oh ya. will definitely get a digital camera when i go back to china in july/august winter holidays so i can go crazy snapping everything n uploading stuff herre n also on the fff group. ya. but meanwhile i really gotta find a good cause to dedicate this blog to. will get thinking. well not really. im really lazy. so probably i'll continue going on bout nuttin in particular nutil some idea decides to stumble into my mind. now this is the longest post i've done os far. very chuffed with myself. but yo. i really gotta stat doing some paragraphing n stuff. ya.
