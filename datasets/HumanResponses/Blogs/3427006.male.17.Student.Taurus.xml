      My brother and I were at a mall yesterday with two of our closest friends, Carly and Jessica.  I realized something yesterday, no matter what has happened in our lives they have always been there through good and bad times.  I realized that whenever I need someone to talk to I have always been able to count on the twins to listen and to tell me their opinions.  They have always been at our house growing up, whenever school let out, they'd be over for sure. Its hard for me to think of days when they haven't been over at our house. The four of us have done practically everything together.   They are two of my true friends. I have very few friends that I could say that about.  Not many people know me as well as these gals. Now that we are getting older our lives will most likely be keeping us from seeing each other as much as we have in the past, but I know that no matter where we are we will be friends. They have meant so much to me in my life that I can't even explain to you in this one simple blog. I have tried my best to show you, but this is only a scratch of the surface of what these two mean to me. I just hope that I have been as good a friend to them as they both have been to me.  It is there birthday today and I just want to wish a happy birthday to two of the greatest people I know.  Happy 16th.

      This is my first blog ever!! woohooo! I guess your supposed to blab about random topics that enter your head around the time you actually are sitting and have nothing better to do. I guess this is one of those times... Ummmmm... I don't like Eggplant. Yup, eggplant.  Reason you may ask? Well, it tastes bad. Um, yeah. Its just bad. I mean it starts out all purple and ends up all white and squishy. Bleh. Uhh... I just realized that maybe this isn't the best topic for a first blog post, and that it is probably a bad topic all together. Soo... let talk about you! Wait, never mind. Thats worse then eggplant.  Well, if your actually reading this then... you should write a blog because you obviosly have nothing better to do.  Errrm... Bye?
