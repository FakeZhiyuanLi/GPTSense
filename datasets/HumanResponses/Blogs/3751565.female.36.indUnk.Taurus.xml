      It is easy to say we love truth more than anything. We try to teach our children to speak it. We require it of our government and our bank statements. We chisel the word into the granite of our courthouses. We swear to tell the whole of it and nothing but it before a judge.   But Truth can cause a lot of trouble when it collides with beliefs and behaviors that are wrong, but which we cherish. Then we must choose. Will we stand for the truth whatever the cost? Or will we deny it for the sake of convenience?  In reply Jesus declared, "I tell you the truth, no one can see the kingdom of God unless he is born again.[ 3:3 Or born from above; also in verse 7] "  (Whole Chapter: John 3 In context: John 3:2-4)  John 3:5 Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, no one can enter the kingdom of God unless he is born of water and the Spirit.    John 5:19 Jesus gave them this answer: "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does.   John 6:26 Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, you are looking for me, not because you saw miraculous signs but because you ate the loaves and had your fill.   As it is, you are determined to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do such things.

        I will never forget when I turned 21 my sister who at the time was 13 going on 30 gave me a birthday card that said maybe now I will start acting my age. I think about that every year as I move from age bracket to age bracket.  What is acting your age? If I had to say I felt an age it might be 12. Is it my personality, temperament or mental illness that keep me in the stage of youthfulness? The following is an interesting commentary on this very topic.  RESIGNATION FROM ADULTHOOD  I am hereby officially tendering my resignation as an adult. I have decided I would like to accept the responsibilities of an 8 year-old again.  * I want to go to McDonald's and think that it's a four star restaurant,  * I want to sail sticks across a fresh mud puddle and make a sidewalk with rocks.  * I want to think M&Ms are better than money because you can eat them.  * I want to lie under a big oak tree and run a lemonade stand with my friends on a hot summer's day.  * I want to return to a time when life was simple; When all you knew were colors, multiplication tables, and nursery rhymes, but that didn't bother you, because you didn't know what you didn't know and you didn't care.  * All you knew was to be happy because you were blissfully unaware of all the things that should make you worried or upset.  * I want to think the world is fair. That everyone is honest and good.  * I want to believe that anything is possible.  * I want to be oblivious to the complexities of life and be overly excited by the little things again.  * I want to live simple again.  * I don't want my day to consist of computer crashes, mountains of paperwork, depressing news, how to survive more days in the month than there is money in the bank, doctor bills, gossip, illness, and loss of loved ones.  * I want to believe in the power of smiles, hugs, a kind word, truth,justice, peace, dreams, the imagination, mankind, and making angels in the snow.  So . . . here's my checkbook and my car-keys, my credit card bills, and my 401K statements. I am officially resigning from adulthood.  And if you want to discuss this further, you'll have to catch me first, cause "Tag! You're it."

      Mental illness is often associated with the homeless man pacing the sidewalk talking to aliens, the woman on television who has 16 personalities and the homicidal mad man featured in the movies.  Words such as crazy, schizo, psychopath and maniac are commonly used in everyday language.  The stigma attached to mental illness comes from a fear of the unknown, a set of false beliefs that stem from a lack of awareness and understanding.  The truth is madness makes the world a better and more beautiful place. Aristotle once said no great genius has ever existed without some touch of madness.  Mental illness is a medical malady no less than heart disease or diabetes. It’s as real as cancer and much more common. It strikes the young and the old, the rich and the poor – some sort of mental disorder afflicts more than one in five Americans in the course of a lifetime.  It goes by many names – schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder are just a few.

      "I, also, would like to look and smile, sit and walk like that, so free, so worthy, so restrained, so candid, so childlike and mysterious. A man only looks and walks like that when he has conquered his Self. I also will conquer my Self... Hermann Hesse. Siddartha  The decision between bondage and freedom seems to be a simple choice.  To be free of all restraints is what I want. I do not consciously want to be a slave to my emotions, my addictions or my bad behaviors. I feel like the Israelites who were finally offered freedom and released from captivity.  I race towards the open spaces to find a desert of vast loneliness. I begin to feel naked without my shackles confused that there is not a taskmaster driving me.  As I head into a life of freedom scared of the unknown I glance back towards my Egypt the only place I have know. Freedom is new to me. Making my way through the desert searching for the promise land fear takes over me.  I reach what seems to be an impassable sea, to survive I search for familiar things to comfort me. I turn to bad behaviors and addictions that provide instant gratification. The pleasure is not the same and offers a fleeting moment of relief. The joy of my freedom is lost as I cling to familiar bondage to ease my suffering. I know I should push through the desert, face my fears and find my promise land. But like the Israelites I wander the desert whining and complaining.  Bowing to temptations like the Israelites worshiped idols. I realize how precious this freedom is and I can taste the milk and honey that flows in the promise land but only when I am faced with slavery again. It takes me weeks to find the path that I have fallen off. Slowly but surely I find my way again headed in the right direction until I come across a difficult part of the journey, which way will I choose? Have I had enough of slavery?

      Right now Herman Hesse's Steppenwolf expresses what I can not.   "There is much to be said for contentment and painlessness, for these bearable and submissive days, on which neither pain nor pleasure is audible, but pass by whispering and on tip-toe. But the worst of it is that it is just this contentment that I cannot endure. After a short time it fills me with irrepressible hatred an nausea. In desperation I have to escape and throw myself on the road to pleasure, or, if that cannot be, on the road to pain. When I have neither pleasure nor pain and have been breathing for a while the lukewarm insipid air of these so-called good and tolerable days, I feel so bad in my childish soul that I smash my moldering lyre of thanksgiving in the face of the slumbering god of contentment and would rather feel the very devil burn in me than this warmth of a well-heated room... For what I always hated and detested and cursed above all things was this contentment, this healthiness and comfort, this carefully preserved optimism of the middle classes, this fat and prosperous brood of mediocrity."
