      I'm feeling the itch.  I want a new computer.  I want a new iBook. I'll take a refurbed one. Apple has their hot deals or something button and they have some cool price breaks.  Do I need one?  Uhm, no. But it'd be cool edit video in the yard.  So feel free to send money.

      There are two kinds of people.  There's us, and there's them.  Choose carefully.

      [spam]  I like to take pictures.  Just snapshots really, catching people off guard as themselves.  So when I got a digital camera a couple Christmases ago, I just took pictures. I started taking chances taking pictures of things that probably wouldn't turn out. What did I care? They're just 1s and 0s on a card. they're easy to delete.  So I took some of these kinds during our trip. And I took a few that looked great. They looked good enough to use as a desktop picture on your computer.  So I submitted them to a place called pixelgirlpresents.com. She liked my picture saying that she doesn't usually post straight pictures but she liked mine.  [/spam]

      Mary's grandmother (who goes by Gigi) is in the hospital again.  This time they may have figured out what caused her to pass out and give herself a concussion. It appears to be dehydration and malnutrition. Evidently she gets stomach pains when she eats so she just doesn't eat or drink.  So they've got her in a semi-private with bags of saline in her arms trying to get fluids in her. She still won't eat though. She just looks at the food, takes a couple of bites then acts like she's just eaten a 64oz steak in 5 minutes so she can get it for free.   So when we visit, we all try to get her to eat. But she just hems and haws. And nobody has the balls to say "If you don't eat you're gonna fucking die!!! Got it??? Eat!!" So we all just grin like idiots.  Her son is a smart guy, he went to the doc and asked if they could give her something that will increase her appetite. Still, somebody needs to go head to head with her and get her to eat.  My feeling though are not good. I think she thinks she going to die. I know because when we left, she made sure to tell me that she loved me. She NEVER does this. Never. So I think she's getting ready, taking care of things before she goes.

      The rest of our vacation trip was pretty cool.  We ate breakfast out everyday. Three out of four time we ate at a chain called "Perkins'". Not bad, just typical breakfast stuff.  Sunday we went to Gatorland. Gatorland is a Sea World wannabe that has alligators instead of whales. The main diff between alligators and whales is that alligators are very stupid and dangerous. Alligators only learn one trick. Eating. That's what they do. So once you seen the chomp on something, you're done. Everyone seemed to enjoy it though and Josh got to sit on the back of a gator with his hands around it's jaws. Pretty damn cool.  Monday was my birthday, the second I've spent with these people. We went to NASA. NASA rocks! They have a visitor center area and tours of the complex. Everything at NASA is big. Big buildings, big rockets and big spaces. The best part was the Saturn V rocket they have on display. It's in a building that has moon mission displays but you hardly notice them. You walk in and the only thing you can notice is that they have a Saturn V rocket indoors!!!! After the tours we we're going to watch a launch of a rocket, but it got postponed because of a very strong storm.  Tuesday was kind of fucked. We we're going to go to Universal Studios but Mary's step-mom Sue got an idea for saving some cash off the ticket price. Orlando is full of time shares, and they all want your money so they try different ways to get you to check out their place. One of the ways is that they offer big discounts on park tickets if you sit through one of their sales pitches. Well she got the idea to sit through one of these and we'd end up saving $150 or so. Well we did and it was a bad experience but I'll post that in another update.  Universal has 2 parks in one. One is ride and coasters, the other is less rides and more behind the scenes movie stuff. Mary wanted to ride "The Mummy's Revenge" ride so we went to the one with fewer rides. Parks in the summer are hot, there're a lot of people and lines are long. We waited for almost an hour to ride the Mummy. So that set the tone for the rest of the day. After the park we ate at the Hard Rock there. Josh had a blast looking at all the rock stuff. He had me running around taking pictures of all the guitars.  Wednesday was pretty fun. First we went to the ocean. We were only able stay for an hour, but Josh and I swam anyway. It was fun, just the 2 of us hanging out in the ocean. After that we headed back over to the same area as NASA for air-boat rides. That was about the best time I had in Florida. Cruising around, looking at alligators and other wildlife in their natural habitat. That was the coolest.  We started driving back on Thursday, and got home last night around 9:30. The house looked bigger for some reason.  Now we just want to rest.

      We left for Florida on Friday.  It was good day. We had no real set time to leave, just before 11am or so. So we left about 8ish and headed down I-10 with the intent on missing rush-hour traffic in Houston and stopping when we got tired of looking at road.  We stopped in Seguin for breakfast at McDonald's which has become a tradtion of sorts for us. Whenever we pass through Seguin at breakfast time on the road to somewhere we have to stop there.  After that, it was just the road. I spent the time listening to "Snowcrash" from Audible.com. I swear to god I love that place. It's just too much of a good deal.  When we got to Houston there was traffic. Of course there's traffic it's fucking Houston. So I take the Jeep off cruise-control and play with the other cars. We almost got in a wreck and killed a motorcycle cop in the same second. We were doing ok when a extra wide load trailer carrying a big ditch digger need to get to the center median. The cycle cop was his escort. We we're right behind the wide load caravan when the four lanes suddenly merged to 3 lanes. "Fuck, fuck, fuck!" All at once I was trying to keep from smashing the cycle cop into the wide load trailer, keep others from doing the same, and keep from getting anything from ramming us.  Ten seconds later all was ok but it was pretty hairy for a few.   After that it was smooth sailing in the HOV lane all the way to downtown. We got through Houston after one stop for drinks.  The rest of the driving was really easy for the rest of the way through Biloxi. We hit a few rainstorms but that was all the trouble we had.  The hotel Hampton Inn where we stayed in Biloxi had free wireless internet in the lobby. Knowing that you can't just stop radio waves without paying extra cash, I cracked open the iBook in our room and sure enough, there was the network.  Their network was wide open, no passwords needed. When I started Safari it went to the Hampton Inn page for that hotel, but that was it. I thought for sure I'd have to crack in but no.  We ate free breakfast the next morning in the lobby and hit the road.  We cruised through the rest of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama in very little time. I thought for sure that we'd be to Orlando by 2:00pm. Florida never stops. It just keeps going. It tricks you.  We finally made it to Kissamee and just drove up the strip, waiting for Mary's parents to get to the time share. But their plane was delayed so we had to try and get the room. We got it and we're shocked at how nice it was.  I'll post pictures when I'm off a dialup.

      Well, at least tomorrow we'll be on the road.  Mary's freaking out as usual. It's her nature to get way to nervous before anything big. She hates change. But to be fair, change hates her too.  We did a last minute checklist thing and so far all we need to do is lock up and leave.  We live in a good neighborhood but the houses on either side have been broken into, one while the people were on vacation. I have a feeling we might be next. So we've gotten timers for lights and stuff. We don't have an alarm system, but that didn't help the guys next door. The thieves cut the phone lines so the security company had no idea.  So we're hiding stuff as best as we can. Guitars are getting shoved under my son's bed and we're hiding all important info away.  The one thing other than security that's bothering me is that I was the net on the road. So I signed up for RR's dial-up service. They're supposed to send me my passwords and stuff, but so far nothing. Oh well.  I may post from the road but who knows.

      I was lucky enough to score a Gmail invite tonight from a guy over at  urlLink AAF . Gmail is Google's new email service. New as in beta new.  What's so cool about another free internet mail service?  This one gives you a gig of storage. That's right, a fucking gig. A gig of storage means never having to delete any messages. Well almost never. A gig equals to about a million with 5 more zeros after in mail messages.  Shlo the guy who gave me the invite is pretty cool guy so I feel bad that I don't know much about him other than he hates Florida.  Thanks Shlo

      One more day of work then I'll be free until the 28th.  Just one more day of spinning my wheels, acting like I'm getting things done.  The agenda for tomorrow is pretty damn light. When I get in I have to call a client about a meeting at 10:00am. We set up the meeting on Tuesday afternoon, but he said "Now give me a call Wednesday afternoon just to make sure nothing pops up". Translation: "I know I just said we'd meet on Thursday morning, but give me a call the day before so I can cancel".  So I call this afternoon as requested.  At this business is this woman. She answers phones. She announces the name of the business and asks how she can direct your call. Her tone is neutral, but in a very charming way. She never lets you know her name. I let her know mine and who I'm with and can I please speak to her boss. "I'm sorry, but he's on the other line with a customer". Having played this game with her at least 40 times over the last month we both know how it's gonna end. I leave her my number and please ask our receptionist page me. She's heard it so many times that she probably doesn't even write it down anymore.  That was at 3:00.  She and I repeat the process at 5:00.  So now I'll have to call at 9:00am tomorrow to make sure the meeting at 10:00 is still on. It won't be. But those are the hoops I have to jump through.  Then in the afternoon I get to direct a 2 camera medical chat show that the host actually pays to have on the air. That's right, pays to have on the air. The show itself isn't that bad per se, it's just that it's hard to get around the fact that it's a 2 camera medical chat show.  One week you might tune in to hear what it was like to head up the entire NYC area medical community during 9/11, the next may be a show about polyps. So the topics are kinda hit and miss.  And to be honest, the show isn't the problem. It's the crew. Our floor crew/production assistants are paid about $6.50 to start. And as the saying says, you get what you pay for. The people who are actually good at running studio camera move up and on to better things. So the ones who are left are a bunch of fucktards who act like they're doing you a favor by showing up. They kind of forget that that's part of the whole job thing.  You don't have to be in MENSA to run camera at a TV station. Most things are formatted to the point that you don't really have to actually know how to run a studio camera. You just need to know 4 words: tilt, pan, zoom and truck. If you know what those words mean and know what to do when you hear them, then you are set.  The problems come when you combine those words with any other words. Then the gears grind, minds melt and hilarity insues.  Example?  Well, when you've run camera for more than an hour you come to the realization that in order to get the glassy lens thing to point in one direction you have to move the un-glassy rear end of the camera in the opposite direction. So in order to pan left, your arms move the tripod handle right. Tilt down? Tripod handles up. Pretty easy. Yet we have guys on the crew who've been working at the station for over a year who don't get it. So I get to say things like "No, your other left" and "No, your other down" to people who's parents have paid good money for degrees from very expensive universities. At least the parents get to brag that their kid has a job at a TV station.  Two weeks ago one of the camera ops pulled me aside after the exciting 2 camera medical chat show. He was concerned that I wasn't giving stand-bys for the next shot. Like "Stand-by  Camera 9, Camera 9 you are hot". Usually I give more stand-bys than are allowable by law, I call shows very well thank you. So I just kind of stared at this guy wondering if his mom knew he had gotten a fucking Manson tattoo on his leg, or if he was ever gonna wear long pants so clients wouldn't have to look at the tattoo.  "Have you thought about this show much?" I ask him. His eyes just glaze over as he tries to figure out where I'm heading with this. "See, here's the thing; this is a chat show. It's not scripted. I don't know what they're going to say or when they're going to say it. So Stand-bys are kind of hard to do".  More glaze. Ugh.  "Let me ask you this, how many cameras do we have on the show?"  He knows this. "Two."  "Right" I say. "So I want you to remember this..."  Glaze again.  "If your camera isn't punched up, it's the very next thing I am going to go to."  He gets it. He understands. He smiles.  Then it dawns on him, I've had to explain something very basic to him. I've told him that water is wet and that bricks are heavy. Still he shows promise. The other ones are very bad.  So like I said, I'm going on vacation on Friday.

      Okay, here's how it went down.  The Client showed up with (follow along here) Mr. Big, Ms. Big and Mr. Not-so-big.  The Client shows up before any of the others and says that Mr. Big just wants to look at some helicopter shots of their resort and sit in on the edit of the spots we were going to edit. The client remembers that she has some music for the spots we're gonna edit in her car, so she runs out to the parking lot to get the CDs.  On the way out she runs into Mr. Not-so-big, they stand outside the station chatting up about who knows what. I run by my office to collect some PR shit that I want to return to the client so her people won't bug me for it later.  I go by the lobby and she and Mr. Not-so-big are still chatting it up so I go back to the edit suite and drop the PR stuff off, then head to the coffee kiosk that keeps me caffed up for free.  I take the long way back to the lobby and before I get there I hear the client's laughter and some other voices I don't know. The receptionist had buzzed her through without me and was just gonna let them wander the halls. I wouldn't give a crap but the Director of Engineering is on a security spazz and reemed me for the very fucking same thing a week before when the receptionist buzzed the client through.  The client has everybody there: Mr. Big, Ms. Big and Mr. Not-so-big. I introduce myself and meet Ms. Big, then re-meet Mr. Big. Mr. Not-so-big and I have met before and he just smiles. Usually he's the big guy but Mr. Big's appearance makes him smaller.  Mr. Big looks at the big pictures of my station's news anchors that line the halls like he's never seen pictures that big in his life. This guy's a high roller and he goes gaga over airbrushed pics of 4- something women when he could buy really hot wanna-bes? Okay.  So we get back to the edit suite. Usually I offer coffee or something to kiss ass, but I'm still pissed at them for postponing so much. I want to get done.  "Let's look at the helicopter shots so (Mr. Big) can see them." Sure, okay.  I put their Beta in the VTR, roll the tape in fastforward scanning for floaty chopper shots. I have never seen the tape but it appears to be a show taped for a local cable show. The show was a pay for show showcasing local businesses that didn't mind paying for exposure. Viewer of course never know that what they are watching is essentially PAID PROGRAMMING acting like a real show.  So I find exactly 2 chopper shots. Ms. Big doesn't like one of the shots because it was shot after a big rain storm so the sand traps are more like ponds, but she's "Cool with the other shot". Mr Big doesn't like the other shot because. That's it. Just because.  So Mr. Big starts talking about how "We're gonna need more chopper shots". Uhm, okay.  "Yeah, more chopper shots and new shots of the condos. We need that stuff for the Promotional DVDs".  The what? I look at The Client. Her eyes make that "you know" look.  Then it clicks. she's told them a bunch of bullshit I don't know about. Okay, I get it now. I'm supposed to act like I've known all along so she doesn't look like an ass.  Yeah, well I'm stilled pissed that you jerked me around for 2 days. I don't wanna play.  "Oooohhhh, Promotional DVDs for the resort. Yeah, this is the first time I've heard about this". Mr. Big looks at her then explains what he wants.  "You're going to working on a Promotional DVD for us that'll be 7 minutes long and..." At this point I just let him talk because I really didn't care what he was saying at this point. All I'm thinking is that I was supposed to be editing a couple of spots, not doing pre-planning fro a long format project.  "Well, I'm gonna have to check with my boss for pricing for the shooting and editing of your promo video; as far as the whole DVD thing goes, we really don't offer that as a service but I'll see what we can do". Translation: "Sure we'll take your money, but I'm gonna have to sub out the DVD thing and double charge you".  So we finally move on to the edit we're supposed to be working on. I'm almost done but they announce that they have a meeting to go to. Yeah, okay. But I tell The Client that she needs to come back after the meeting and approve the spot after the render.  So after they leave I finish the spot. Around 5-ish I gave her a call to have approve the spots. Her phone was off. Called her 10 minutes later. Off.  Finally I get her on the phone, but she can't come to the station cuz she's at home getting ready for her vacation. "But I trust you so just make copies for the other stations, and I'll see you when I get back".  Yeah, TTFN.  We'll see if this bites me in the ass later.

      So I'm waiting. It's not yet 2:00 but I expect them at any moment.  I wonder how this is all gonna shake out. I didn't think 'til now that since the big cheese is coming to the sesssion that he might not be happy with the spots.  But this isn't the way to let me know. Call me in advance so I don't get blind-sided. It's that whole respect thing again.  I better get ready to tap dance.

      So I'm sitting here.   Waiting.  Sitting here with nothing to do because a client postponed their edit session. Again. They wanted this emergency edit session to update their spots and I made time. "Sure, Monday morning will be fine" I told them.   So Monday comes. But my client is a no-show.  Hmmm.  So I call her around 11-ish, "Hey, just checking to see if you're OK..." I say. "Oh, I'm running late" she says.   No shit dumb fuck, that's why I'm calling.   "So do you have an ETA?" I ask. "Well," she says, "I'm just getting some last minute things taken care of before I go on vacation. Are you free this afternoon?"  She knows that if I'm open I'll say sure. I'm a nice guy. "Yeah the afternoon will be fine. Can you get here around 2:00?" I like to go home at 5:30 like I'm scheduled. Why work late if you're on salary?  "That sounds great, I'll be there at 2:00."  2:00 comes and goes. Frustration settles in. I just want to get the job done. But I'm not gonna call her. I'm tired of fucking around with her. I don't mind people being late, but this is a total lack of respect.  So 4:30 rolls around and she calls. "I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to make it. What about tomorrow?"  So much for the emergency.  "Sure, Tuesday morning, 9:00am."  "Great, I'll be there."  So today is Tuesday. I walk in to my office and check my voicemail. It's her saying that now her bosses (or clients, I haven't figured out her position in this whole thing) wants to come and give approval to the new spots. they can't make it to 2:00 in the afternoon.  I call her back to find out WTF is going on, and confirm they'll be here at 2:00.  Will they show? Will I be nice, or do I go postal?  I just want to be done.  So I'm waiting.

      Just a weird week.  Starting with Mary backing the Jeep over my cat. Then Mary's grandmother fracturing her skull on a kitchen counter.  Tonight we found out that Mary's step-dad's mom has ovarian cancer.  All this during Reagan's funeral. Just gave life a freaky feel.  Then at about 10:30 we noticed a couple of ambulances and a firetruck at a down and across the street. Josh's friend Jack' grandfather died. Heart attack. He was walking the dog earlier, went in to watch TV and about 20 minutes later he was gone.  I'd rather go that way than a car accident or fire.  I've had enough of death. I'm done with it.

      This Thursday is the last day of work before my vacation kicks in  We're going to Florida on Mary's Dad's tab. They have a time-share in Orlando or something so we're going. Driving across the country down I-10. Traveling the great South on the way to the Atlantic.  We're looking forward to it. The last real vacation I've had was last summer's trip to NYC. Even though Mary was there, it was really just me and Josh. The 2 of us riding the subway, eating food from a cart on the street, having breakfast in Central Park. It was great, but Mary missed a lot because of her convention/award show.  This time it's a 3 of us. Plus Mary's dad and stepmom.  Oh joy. The stepmom can be real bitch, but as long as the in-laws keep drinking things'll be cool.  We plan to hit Disney, Universal, NASA and more.  Josh and I want to hit the  urlLink Kona Skatepark . That'll be strange cuz I've "been" there in THPS. I've skated every bit of it in a video game. I've seen every inch there, so it'll be odd to actually see it in real life.  I'm gonna miss tacos.

      Mary's grandmother is home from the hospital after spending the last few days in ICU due to a fractured skull.  I thought for sure a 92 year old woman with a fractured skull would be in the hospital for longer, but evidently I'm not a doctor.

      Thursday started out with the news.  It seems that overnight greater Dallas was downpoured into a flood. Parts all around were under water. All the TV stations were there live with their "action cams" giving reports on the aftermath, and that it wasn't over yet.  Mary didn't even have time to notice. She was going to have a busy day with her convention and prolly wouldn't be seeing the outside for a day or two anyway.  Josh and I didn't have too many options; parts of the city are flooded, I don't know the city. It seemed best to just stay local in downtown Dallas and not drive anywhere. The last thing I want to do is add "high water rescue" to my vacation plans.  So I had to figure out what to do with Josh to fill the day.  First we found a place near the Subway that made breakfast. Then we scouted about a little before returning to the hotel. We stayed in for a good part of the day and traded guitar licks. Thank god he asked to bring his guitar because it helped to pass the day.  Noon had us driving around trying to find a Walgreens. I always forget to pack something and this time it was my razor. We bought some chips and some sodas along with a package of Oreos for Mary. Halfway back to the hotel I realized I'd forgotten to buy a razor. That'll give us something to do Friday.  Mid afternoon it started to clear up so we grabbed our boards and went for a ride. Downtown Dallas was cleaned up a few years back. There's biiiiiiiig money there. And it had all of the sidewalks repaved with brick. So riding around was a little bumpy, but not bad enough that you couldn't ride. Just an ever present clicking.  We rode all the down to the touristy "West End" and only got a couple of remarks. One guy looked at me and said "Woah, somebody's doing it old school." GRRRRR!!!!!! Am I that old that I get the "old school" moniker? After a while we just picked up our boards and started walking. About 10 minutes later some older lady remarked "I heard that skateboarders couldn't be on the sidewalk". That pissed me off because at that point we were pedestrians! We were walking and had been for over 10 minutes. I let it go, because if I said anything I'd be the asshole. Old ladies always win in this so why fight.  We headed back and found a cool park made for carving. So we did. Then went back to the hotel and made dinner plans.  Mary had come in and out while we were gone. We really didn't expect to see her this week. We decided to have some pizza at a place real close to the hotel instead of going to the touristy West End. It was a cool little place. The walls were covered with pictures. Some were of family. Most were of patrons getting caught mid bite, business men and women with napkins placed as bibs trying to smile with half bitten slices hanging from their mouths. Then there were a couple of pictures of celebrities who'd visited. There was a picture Jay Leno mugging it up, and sports celebs that were from Dallas. Bet the best shot was of Mohamed Ali looking young and healthy, totally unaware that the owner was trying to take a picture with him, just trying to leave. Josh didn't know who he was. So I told him a little about the greatest.  We walked back and watched some TV until Mary came back to the room.

      We drove to Dallas on Wednesday. It was uneventful, until we got close to our hotel.  We were on IH35E, and needed to stay on 35E but we turned off. This wouldn't usually happen with both Mary and I in the car, but we were too busy looking at the buildings like a couple of yokels and missed our turn. So we circumnavigated downtown and made it to our hotel by accident.  Checking in was a pain. For some reason the Adam's Mark-Dallas decided that it would be ok to have the guest registration desk manned with only 4 people. Just 4. They had 2 national conventions checking in and only 4 people at the desk? So Mary waited in line while Josh and I just waited. When Mary got to the front of the line things looked not-right, so I went up to help. Our credit card was being rejected. A lot. Mary was emotional as Mary is and became embarrassed and walked away.  We called our credit company and found that the guy at the counter had tried to charge us for 17 days instead of 4! We didn't so the charge was refused. The CC Co was kind enough to remove the denial and we went back to the line.  The line was even longer, Mary was ready to throw in the towel. So I walked up to another counter. I explained that their guy had screwed up royal and they checked us in no prob.  After that we were all a little drained so we walked down the street and had dinner at a Subway.  One thing that was freaky was downtown Dallas; we are the people? There are these huge buildings but we never see that many people. It's just odd.  Later that night it started to rain and started the worst flood Dallas has seen in 50 years.  More later.

      The DNC is on. And I don't give a flying fuck at a rolling donut.  I vowed to become more informed and more involved in my nation's electoral process, but just hasn't happened.  I used to be informed. I used to be involved.  It's not that I don't care; what kind of person wouldn't care about his future?  No, I care. But at the end of the day do I care enough to learn the issues? Obviously I know the issues. They're pretty big. It's hard to miss them.  I think the problem is that I have yet in my adult life to see a candidate that I can truly get behind.  None.  Part of the problem is that I look back on history and see great men/women doing great things. Today they are missing. Where are the Trumans? Where are the Roosevelts? Lincolns? Jeffersons?  Are they around anymore? I don't think so.  I think todays' candidates are "most likely to wins" based on demographics of what todays' voters want and how well they'll play the game once they get in.  I don't know if it even matters who gets the big job anymore.  That being said I'll probably pull the Kerry lever. Not so much because I am behind the man, but because I can't stand what Bush has done to the world. the world my family lives in. The world my son will inherit.  Mr. Kerry, when/if you get the job, don't let us down. We're quite literally banking on you doing the right thing.

      With everything that's going on right now, I'm surprised we're still going to Dallas.  We're going to Dallas so Mary can attend the Romance Writers of America's 2004 convention. Mary's up for a  urlLink Golden Heart Award  again this year. If she wins it'll almost guarantee that her book will get published. Even if she doesn't win it'll be good for the editors and agents to put a face to the voice, and maybe get published anyway.  Josh and I have plans to skate the  urlLink X Games Skatepark . Well, mostly Josh. But I want to hit a couple of museums while we're there. And Six Flags too.  I don't know if we're gonna spring for the extra $10 a night charge for internet in our room so this may be the last thing I write before we go.

      This is the first night in a long time that things have felt even halfway normal.  Josh is in the red room playing his Strat through my gear. He sounds pretty good. He needed something besides video games to do indoors. And it's a scientific fact that you can pick up more girls playing guitar than you can playing video games. I should know, that's how I met Mary. ;-)  Mary's at a BBQ/party being thrown for the lucky defectors from her school. One of the leftbehinds is throwing it. I'm jealous because of the whole BBQ thing. They're prolly burning their old school shirts right now.  Mary really needed a night away from the nursing home. The hospital suggested hospice services and Mary and I tried to explain what that meant to her mom, but she is still in denial.  Things are about as normal as can be expected.  What a way to start my vacation. That sounds kind of shitty, but all I want to do right now is sleep.

      I've wanted to write about Mary's grandmother Gigi for while but I haven't figured out how to do it.  Essentially I'm writing about waiting for someone to die, but that sounds so callous. But it's what we're doing. Waiting.  Gigi took a good fall almost 2 months ago. She fractured her skull and it left a blood clot on her brain. She left the hospital rather quickly for a 92 year old and was home after a short 4 day stay. Then she was back in after a fainting episode; this time for good.  She stayed at the first hospital for a couple weeks. It was trauma based and for the most part it seemed couldn't do anything for her. She needed rehab. So she was moved to a hospital with much better rehab resources.  She was there for 3, 4 weeks? I can't remember. The time is just blur of going there every night to visit. I don't know if this last hospital was able to help her at all. Gigi got steadily worse. No improvement. Her hearing worsened, her speech became softer and her body began to shake.  But I think the worst part for her was that she was having a harder time communicating. I think it was here that she decided that she was done.  So the family had to decide what to do with her.  Gigi's son didn't want her to go into a nursing home. I think he didn't want her to go a home because this would be admitting some kind of failure on his part. But he didn't want her to go home to his house. She'd spent the last 18 years at my in-laws' and why couldn't she go back there? So he came up with an unfair arrangement, Gigi would stay at my in-laws' house, the son would come over and take care of her during the day, and my mother in-law could take care of her the other 16 hours of the day after she got home from teaching elementary school.  Thank god a nurse came along and set him straight. She told him "There are 25 trained people taking care of her at this very  moment. What makes you think you can do a better job than them?" She let that sink in and walked away.  A little more than a week ago,Gigi ended up staying in a nursing home not even a mile away from our house. Don't confuse this with assisted living, this is a place where people go when they need long term medical attention. It's nice enough and a bargain at $2,000 a month.  Still Gigi's condition waned. It became obvious to us all that her condition wasn't going to get better. I know she knew she wasn't getting better because as Mary, Josh and I were leaving one day last week she told me she loved me. She'd never done that before.  Friday on my home from work Josh called from the home and told me hurry up because Gigi thought she was dieing. I got there and things were bad. The whole family was there. They had her on a breathing treatment. It didn't look good but her condition improved. After a while when things looked better we all left.  After I got off work Saturday morning, we went by and the nurses had her dressed and in a wheelchair. So along with Mary's brother, we wheeled her outside. Josh "drove" and we sat outside for about 15 minutes. Gigi hadn't really been speaking for a a week now and seemed to be content just looking around.  She appeared more delicate to me than ever before. She'd always been old from the day I first met her, but never delicate. Never fragile. Saturday morning she looked to me as if the wind blew the wrong direction she would break.  That afternoon as Mary was on her way to visit, her youngest brother Michael called to let us know something bad was happening. So Josh and I piled in the car and raced over.  When we got there we found out she had a seizure and this was probably it. She had a couple of more seizures before the meds kicked in. She's been unconscious since then and it doesn't look good.  She has a "Do not resuscitate" order so it's just a matter of time. We go and sit around, on the floor if there aren't enough chairs and just talk. Sometime about her, sometimes about trivial things. But always talking.  We wait.  Our lives are kind of on hold. So we wait.

      My wife has been having trouble at the schools she teaches at. Used to teach at.  Her principal was a terror. Her method of management is ridicule, deception and blame. There is too much to tell here. Let it suffice to say that if half of your staff has filed grievences against you to the school board, then you are a bad, bad person.  After the grievences were filed, the principal became bent on revenge against anyone who was involved. with the end result being that my wife's school became a very shitty place to work for a number of people.  So, this summer most of the filers started requesting transfers and otherwise seeking work elsewhere. My wife included.  Luckily my wife landed a gig this week teaching 5th grade at a nice school with a good principal. And a few others found work as well. But my wife was happy and sad. She would be working in a better environment, but she'd be leaving her friends and back in the classroom after spending the last 7(?) years being the best elementary music teacher in her district. But for the most part she felt great about the move.  Until last night.  She got a few calls from her peeps last night saying that the evil witch of a principal was getting transfered to a different school. Just rumour at this point, but it hit her in a bad way.  If the rumour was true, she'd made her move too soon. If the rumour was true, she hadn't had to leave after all.  At this point she settled in to a bit of second guessing. But the deal is done. She's gone.  And with this came guilt. Had she let her students down as well?  Mary is an emotional one. She lives by her heart, and I love her for it. But for her sake I wish she'd just waited. Now she has to deal with a major change in her life because of making a choice 2 days early. Sometimes it's better to wait. Just a little while to see how things develop.  Of course it's easy for me to say wait; I never had to work with her principal. And I'm not Mary. I like a good fight. I have no problem tilting at windmills.  I hope I can give Mary the strength to get through this. It's another in recent trials that the fam has gone through.  I just want her to be happy.

      I just got through watching a band called  urlLink Yeah Yeah Yeahs  on Letterman.  It was about the coolest thing I've ever seen done with just drums, guitars and vocals.  The singer is beautiful. She's tall and was moving all chrome.  The guitar player was filling all frequencies at once with a wash of tones so full you couldn't tell it was just one guy.  The drummer's "thing" was to thunder in time.  I am a fanboy after one song!

      Josh is becoming a pretty good guitar player.  I couldn't play as well as him at 13. He just has a knack for it. He hears something in his head and bangs it out until he's happy with it.  This is the guitar he ended up saving up for, except his has a rosewood fingerboard.   It plays pretty nice for a $300 guitar.  The next step is a good amp.

      Yea me!  I get to finish a Doppler promo today. But as usual, the producer doesn't know what she wants, the GRFX guy got the script late so my GRFX elements are not done and won't be until I'm ready to go home.  I'm getting tired of the Promotion "Producers" coming to me with copy and know idea what they want to do with the video. "What do you want here?" I ask. "I dunno." is usually the answer.  They need to earn their pay, and stop having me bail their collective asses out.  I'm tired of it, and I'm not doing it anymore.  I have my own projects to think about!

      I don't dream much.  Or rather, if I do I don't remember many of them.  But last night I had a vivid dream about the Chili's I used to work at. I haven't worked there in over 10 years, but it pops up in my dreams from time to time.  The dreams always have me cooking with the crew I started with. There's Scott who's going to UTSA so he can join the Navy as an officer. Warren is there to supplement his income as a 23 year old slum lord. Dash is sweating in the corner but you can't tell if it's from the heat of the kitchen or from his drinking problem. Dash isn't his real name. They call him Dash because of his thin build. A guy from high school is there. Mike C. will become one of my best friends during my stay. T.O. is from my high school too, but a couple of years older than me.  There they are. I see them with my 20 year old eyes. We all had dreams then. We all were going somewhere. Except for Dash, maybe.  But not last night.  Last night I was at Chili's but it was present day, which is strange because they closed the one I worked at. I was cooking there, but I didn't work there. And the old crew wasn't there either. It was me working with new guys. They were younger. I was the old man. It felt so real. I remember noticing the old floor tiles had been replaced by some stained cement and commenting on the change.  When I woke I felt strange, but good. Like I put something to rest.  The whole thing had a closure feel to it, like they were letting me say goodbye. I guess I needed to say goodbye to that time of my life. I said farewell to the place the last night they were open. A lot of the oldtimers showed up on the last night and shared memories about the place over drinks and laughs. I ordered the last drink out of that place, then stole some things to remind me of the good times and better people.  I'm not the boy that started working there in '86. But that's where I grew up. And when I left it was a different place.  You can't go back to stay, but you can visit.

Producers who are all concept and no execution are not producers at all. 3. Whenever you have a plumbing problems that require you to dig, hire a plumber. 4. Josh's family loves him. Happy Birthday my son. 5. Pay attention. You don't know when your life is going to suddenly change.  I probably write what happened this weekend, tomorrow.

      At least new to you.  I took some pictures on our vacation and some turned out good for desktops. I submitted to pixelgirlpresents.com a couple of weeks ago. She liked rain_by_car and posted on her site really quick.   But I'd also submitted a picture of the Baton Rouge Bridge. We were heading East on the bridge and there was a traffic jam. So I spent about 2 minutes just snapping shots. This was one of them.  It feels good to have someone say your pics are good enough for their site.  So I've posted that picture and more on the sidebar.

      I'm tired.  I'm getting ready to leave work. I was going to stay later, but I'm at the point where my mind isn't making the best choices right now. Not the best thing when you are editing commercials.  I guess I'll just wake early tomorrow and get here before I need to start directing the show and finish the spots then.  Blog idea: emoticons. For tired. :-(

      The show I was supposed to direct cancelled for the day. Thier guest couldn't make it and they had no back-up plan. So they get to run a re-run.  So that gives me a little breathing room to get stuff done.  Doing your boss's job while he's away sucks; you don't know which one takes priority. So they both suffer.  But even though I have some extra time, it still looks like I'll be staying late.

      Today I'm playing catch because of my earlier slacking this week.  I just spit up a script for a local jeweler who has changed the concept of his campaign three times now. There's no rush on him really; he won't hit air until next month. He's been dragging his heels with us for about a year now.  I also need to edit a couple of spots that I should've done yesterday.  And I'll need to write and edit two more spots for a project I forgot about. But I may end up doing those Saturday after I direct our morning newscast.

      Yeah, I've got things to do.  I have work piling up, but I don't feel really motivated enough to do any of them. I've got clients to call, scripts to write, but here I sit waiting for 5:30 to come so I can run home.  It's not that I'm lazy. If someone were to bolt through the door and ask me to do something I'd be all over it. I'd be the man for that job.  But since coming back from vaction I've just been... meh. Just meh.  So I guess it's just time for me to get my ass in gear and do what I get paid for. I'll haul my ass to the edit suite and crank out another crappy local spot. I'll write the scripts that need to be written. I'll call my clients. I'll do what I have to do to get by this afternoon.  Then I'll go home.  And do it again tomorrow.  Thank god I have a vacation again in 2 weeks.

      What I mean by that is how did I become a Google services user?  I use their search engine. I use their e-mail. I even use their blogging service for this website.  I just want to know how this happened.  I know it didn't happen on purpose, like I woke up one morning and said "Damn all the other internet services out there, I'm a Google Man".  No, it didn't happen that way. But something happened.  I just got absorbed by it. Not all at once, but little by little I was using more Google stuff.  I'm not sure if I should be bothered by this. It's not like it's MSN, is it? It's different, right?  If .Mac was free I'd be there. But they want the cashola. So I guess I'm here with a combo of Google and  urlLink ms11.net  until I fine something better. Cuz I ain't gonna find nothing cheaper than free.

      Randy is off this week.  That means I have to do his job as well as mine. So I get to direct GDSA at 9am to 10am. Then I look through all of his stuff for the day. Check faxes. Take care of any programming problems. Then handle any freaky phone calls that come up.  Like today, I puched GDSA then Took care of a missed sat feed for a show that airs today on our sister-station. Then took care of an up-link for an outside media company. I also called a a company in LA to let them know we don't rent our TV trucks. Now I have to hunt down the number for a company who gives us a show that airs Sunday; their feed was screwed up so I need to find out what they're gonna do about the show.  And I haven't even had time to mess with my stuff.  So there you go.  Randy cannot take off any more.  Ever.

      So we finally had my b-day celebration here at home.  We couldn't before because we were in Florida on vacation. And then we had to wait because of circumstance. But today was the day.  But when it happened, it was pretty meh. It wasn't anything in particular really, it was just that it was lackluster. Everybody was cool and all.  Maybe since it was 2 weeks after my birthday. Maybe it just reflects me all to well.  I probably won't remember it next year. Or maybe I will and I be doing "compare and contrast" on the two.  I should stop bitching. I've got it good.

And it seems to be a lot of work to get it to work.  I can see the network, I just can't join it.  Yes, I have all the passwords. Yes, the most current drivers are installed. I just can't get it to work.  But I can join a neighbors unprotected network just fine.  Hmmm...

      I'm really looking forward to sleeping in.  Tomorrow we're supposed to have a family get together to celebrate my birthday. My birthday that was 2 weeks ago yesterday. I'm not gonna get shit.  Yeah I'm materialistic, so what?   Actually, I prolly end up with something cool from my wife and son. The rest will give me Best Buy cards of various denominations.  I really don't like gift cards. They are themed money that forces you where to spend it. If you don't know what to get me, then give me actual cash. That way I can pool all of the cash together and get what I want.  Fuck, it's only 10:52 and I'm yawning. We had a full day, but still.  I think I might try to throw a new refurbed 12" iBook with Airport on our Apple loan soon. :sneek:

      Do yourself a favor and go see it.  It well may be the very best super-hero movie of all time.  Maybe.

      Tonight after visiting Mary's G-Ma in the hospital, we ate at Chipotle.  It's good for a one trick pony. The only thing of substance on the menu are burritos. It's what they do. You choose what you want on it and they charge you a lot. The cool thing about this place though is the customer service. Josh ordered a burrito with Barbacoa (think of it as roasted meat). They had just run out and Josh had to wait all of 2 minutes and they gave us his burrito and drink for free. That saved us almost $7.00. WOW!  Things took us a little longer than planned at the hospital, we'd planned to take Josh by Sam Ash Music to take another hands on look at the Fender Strat he wants. It costs about $350. He's got about $140 bucks and has been doing extra work around the house to save up for it, but it's taking longer than he thought it would. His birthday's on the 12th so he'll prolly get close then.  After dinner there was no way we'd get to Sam Ash before it would close, so we went to a CD Exchange that was close by.  Josh has been looking for some old Bob Dylan, Cream and (barf) Yes. He has pretty sophisticated musical tastes for a soon to be 13 year old. He likes new stuff like Q.O.T.S.A., Eagles of Death Metal and White Stripes but knows crap when he hears it.  We went through the aisles trying to pick out the good from the bad. You never know what you'll find when you go to a used CD store. Surprise, uhm, surprise you.  I found a couple of things that caught me off guard and one CD I thought I'd never see.  The first thing I found was Michael Penn's first album. We used to love listening to "No Myth" and fell in love with the entire disc when it came out. A good find. Then Mary found "History repeats" from Split Enz; a very good best of.  Then the thing that made me blink a couple of times found my hands. I was looking at a CD of "Lament" by Ultravox. I was an Ultravox fan. I had all Ultravox albums with Midge Ure. While others were singing "What I like about you", I was listening to "A Man of Two Worlds". The music was breathtaking, the words had weight; and doomed to never appeal to Madonna-bes. I was in love. Nothing much ever amounted to Ultravox. Though Midge Ure was more than co-writer of "Do they know it's Christmas" with Sir Bob. Without Midge there would have been no Live Aid.  Josh came over with "The Best of Cream" and we escaped paying only $35.   USED CDS ROCK!!!!!!

      So it looks like somebody's spoofed one of my Hotmail email addys.  I'm getting a bunch returned stuff, stuff I never sent. And emails with strange attachments. A lot of the emails with attachments get blocked so I never see them.  The whole thing is pissing me off though. I use that account for online semi-official transactions. But all is cool, I just moved all of my real world stuff over to my Gmail account so things should be ok.  I'm kind of bothered by the fact that I can't seem to find a link to report this to the Hotmail people.  I'm prolly gonna let that mailbox fill up so shit gets bounced back to the senders.  I blame whitey!!!!!

      I finally figured out how to add links to the sidebar here.  Actually, it wasn't that hard. I found the code on the Blogger site and just modified it a little. Now I just need to figure out the code to have the links open in a new window.  The links I posted are split between blogs that are interesting to me because of the ideas on them. The writing is great and the views wide.  The other links are forums I live at or mod, and stuff from my past.  Visit the links if you get a chance. They tell a lot about me.

       	 		 		 The day before we left for Dallas I was unplugging my cell phone from the charger.  My grip wasn't as tight as I thought and the phone was launched from my hand at an incredible velocity straight to the floor. I checked the face and everything looked ok so I pocketed the phone and left to run some errands.  Later I tried to check my voice mail but it couldn't find the network. So I rebooted the phone (why not, it's more computer than phone). This time the screen was about half the resolution and much dimmer, and still couldn't find the network.  When we returned I went to the Cingular store to see about getting a replacement. The store has very bright colors that hurt the eye. You're supposed to sign in but there wasn't anyone else so I jumped to the front of the line.  I showed the clerk my phone and he essentially told me I was screwed. I don't have insurance on the phone so I have to pay full price. And Sony stopped making the phone anyway so I can't get a replacement, but they'd be happy to sell me the more expensive model for full price.  Cell phones are fucking expensive. Fuck.  I'm prolly gonna get one off of Ebay. 		 		 		 			 urlLink     			 				 			 urlLink T226 			 			Originally uploaded by 			 urlLink pi22seven .

      I just kind of noticed last night that I don't update my links at all. Originally I was gonna update stuff all the time, but life gets in the way.  So now you have my solemn vow to update more often.  Like twice or something.

      Gigi's funeral is set for Thursday with the Rosary the night before.  I don't do funerals well. I hate them. I never know what to say, because I know that there's nothing that can be said to make things better. The only thing that eases the feelings is time.  But this time I won't be trying to comfort friends or coworkers, this time it's family. Mary is doing as well as can be expected now, but Thursday will be a different story. Josh seems to be okay, but I feel like he's holding things in. I wish I could help him, but I don't thinks he's ready for me to help yet.  Just by chance I saw a cartoon that I'd clipped years ago. It was brown with age and half covered by photos and memos I'd posted on my cork board behind my desk. It's a single frame of two men in the showroom of a funeral home. The guy on the right is angry at the guy on the left, who is wearing a party hat. The showroom is decorated for party, streamers over the caskets and all. A banner above their heads says "We put the "Fun" in Funeral!". I decided when I clipped the comic that that's exactly what I wanted. I want a party funeral. When I go I want people to push my casket around a bunch of bars and have a good time.  So do I need to have that put in my will?

      Mary's grandmother died this morning a little before 10.  We were on the way back from Dallas after attending Mary's RWA convention/awards ceremony. We'd stopped at a gas station in Waco for something to drink when Mary got the call. When Josh and I got into the car with the sodas she was on the phone. Her face was stone then she looked at me and nodded.  At that moment I didn't think her grandmother had died, just that she'd gotten worse and that we'd better hurry to get home. When we got on the highway again Mary burst out crying. It could only mean one thing. There was no place to pull over on the stretch we were on, just high barriers from road construction. So I tried to comfort her as well as I could while driving. But she was more worried about Joshua than herself. Josh sat dazed for about a hundred miles before he could cry.  We got home a couple of hours later and unpacked in a somber mood.  The funeral looks like it will be on Wednesday. Josh and I will be pallbearers. He's only 13 but understands that it is an honor. He's holding up amazingly well and we take turns supporting Mary.  Mary is "holding it together". Her words. But she's crushed. Mary and her grandmother were great friends, closer than Mary and her mom. Mary feels guilty that we weren't there. But we wouldn't have been there if we'd been in town. We would have been eating breakfast someplace, maybe on the way but not there.  We said our goodbyes before we left knowing that this might happen, but you can't ever be prepared. There's still that feeling that someone has knocked all of your breathe out.
