       urlLink    *WanderinG* WhaT was He ThinkinG OF??? &nbsp; urlLink     Hi FlokS i"m Back With some Big surpriseS... WhilE i Caught this Picture oF Mr Chen Kang Wei and he was feeling some kind of senseation at that time i think. I mean look At his picture imagine whaT else could he be thinking oF? Well thats remains a mystery to all of our minds... This picture i'll call it the Wonder picture. Because iT leaves us all wondering about it.. BEsidEs thAt i Think iT's wonDERful!  Chen Kang Wei.. He's not exactly punkY... not really aerobic... not too sWeet as well. He's sTrict when he as to and has great leaderShip qualities and also has great influence over his peers... Haha.. He's a GreAt friEnd oF minE.. I regArd him as mY brothER. Because he's there to Guide me when i'm loSt* Jus like a liGhthouSE In the the sEA! and i'm this tinY boaT out therE in thE Deep BLue SEa. I think he's gReat with Design and technologY and he has a chaRactER. Well... He's tall and Fit i should say... He speaks  "Japenis " too. He is a gREat person to hanG ouT with... He's fantastic really.. he really is... He has made a mark in his school. Almost everyone know's him.. He's PresidenT of the Prefectorial Borad 2003 oF his school..   But still I'm wondering what was him thinking about in the sand bed.. with sand bOobS? and A hairy part and with a Big Gun..   Still puzzled..

       urlLink    Rain&nbsp; urlLink      Well people... Have u thought about the rain cycle?? isn't it a very beautiful cycle... rain falls and the water evaporates and form clouds when the clouds are heavy it rains again. That explains why we have eough water for our daily use.   Some of us like the rain... While others no... Some prefer the  sunny sun! ... While some prefers the  RainY Rain!  Which one would u prefer???  I like the sun and also the rain! Sunshine makes me feel good and it energises me. it gives energy to the plants and all.. But sometimes rain is also needed to cool things down and it's fun to get wet and play in the rain.   I would like to exprience the four seasons but unfortunately Singapore doesn't exprience all 4 seasons sad case. But  i'm Loving it  here in S'poRE! No 4 seansons But no DiasterS too. YeAH!

      Has Skateboarding always been a nuisance to the public? Well... Skateboarding has always played a very important part in my life and i like the sport. I would say it's an Exotic Sport " for all ages"  haha! Maybe Not... Well Jus wish to shaRe this sport to more people so that everyone can enjoy the fun in this sport. It takes time and motivation from fellow friends if you ever wish to excel in this sport. Because it is a sport which needs loads of time to get "simple" tricks right so i owe all my skateboarding archivements to 2 of my great friends GAb and NaDz. They haVe been teaching me all the Stuff i know and been with me when i fell. They aRe Really Great palS. I lovE doimng things that makes me feel good and do what's fun and riding on my skateboard makes me feel good. And thats what i'm doing now and i'm goona being doing it for a long time..

      HI everyone! iT's daY to of me and my bloggy Blog. And TodaY is Father's DAy jus wanna Wish all the PAps in the WoRld a haPPy fAThers DAy!!! While it's also a sunday and i've done a reflection of what i've done in this week... It has been the best week of my holidays and also the worst week.   My school sent me for the xslc convention. I went there on the First day thinking that it was a F***ing convention and i had a mindset that it would be the worst convention i ever been to.. The first day change it all... I made new friends and we had fun. 2nd DAy was when all the boring stuff started with all those discussions and assemblies but nevertheless we still had fun at the same time. Amazing! isn't it? As we all knoW... time flies... and it was time for us to part. It's was very sad though. wE became good frenz form strangers and went through fun and boring parts together. I'll like to thank Maznah, Darren, Sangiv, Lourna, Cat, Yangrong, Ailin, Sabrina, Shi mei and Zi zong for making this 5days of the month a fun and memorial one. This would be the 5 days i'll never forget. XSLC i reckon to be the best ever convention !   After 5 days of no skating, I went to skaTe on sAt! Although without any Friends with me Bumming on my skate board along my neighbourhood made me feel Good! so i just went bumming around and "ollieing" over curbs. I was feeling high on my skateboard maybe because i missed it so much after no skating for 5 days.   WEll thaT's all folks for this Week! More stuFF would be further Updated oVer this  BLoGGy bloggggggg BLog SPOT!   RoCk on!
