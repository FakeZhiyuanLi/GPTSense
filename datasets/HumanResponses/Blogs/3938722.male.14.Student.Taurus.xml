       Well i was in Frisco for the last three days...therefore you get a special deal! wooooo!   Day 1: Got into our hotel and ate at an indian place    Day 2: Walked around the peir for like the whole day, in the process pretty much turning my legs to very soft jelly, saw the Punisher    Day 3: Woke up at like 6 to rush to Karate at like 3, but my dad's car did NOT sprout wings and fly (faster than 60 miles an hour grr) so we got there like 15 minutes late...    Anyhoo, after i went to Devin's bday party, which was fun...watched Scary Movie 3 and Jeepers Creepers 2.   REVIEWS!!!   The Punisher:&nbsp;four words - random acts of violence...it follows the plot of the actual comic (i think) but its fun to watch...plenty of bloodshed. BEE!   Scary Movie 3: freaking hilarious.   Jeepers Creepers 2: Stupid slasher movie. Average noodles dudes, average.   ANYHOO&nbsp;i hope you all had a fun time...i really need to get some sleep now.    &nbsp;

       hey everyone! to begin this post i would like to share a few words that i found in&nbsp;lilly's AIM profile.  "HOT TOPIC: cashes in on convenience. Instead of directly supporting a band by mailordering clothing and cd's and waiting a week, kids can cruise on down to the closest mall in the family mini van and buy sh*t from there while mommy and daddy walk around JCPennys.  Hot Topic is no different than American Eagle, Gap, Pac Sun, A & F, etc. because when you get down to it, the companies thrive on deceiving people into blurring the line between fashion and personal identity. People want to become the clothes they wear."   can u sence the truth in these words? cuz i know i can. its sooo true...the only thing is that people tend to not want to see it. i mean, i dont mind the store, but its called "identity theft..."   anyhoo, ill be leaving to san francisco tomorrow for a couple of days... top fun! goin to hang at the wharf and eat fish and chips for 3 days straight. anyhoo, not much to post, exept that i saw saving private ryan for the first time yesterday...great movie, even with the immence amount of "extremely graphic intense war violence and language" that it packs the film with.   todays lesson: Hot Topic is exactly like A&F! but with a little bit better stuff. and prices, even thought HT prices arent really anything to brag about.    &nbsp;  Listening To: Recognize - Flaw (Endangered Species)   Reading:&nbsp;Abhorsen by Garth Nix

       hey everyone.   wow todays saturday already eh? i woke up at 10: 35 with a rush of cold ice water down my shirt...FUN! as i felt this icy cold down my back, i hear the words, "GET UP AND TAKE A SHOWER, WE NEED TO GET TO KARATE IN 20 MINUTES!"   i took the shower. oh yeah, i took it all right.   fun stuff...got the wind knocked out of me 3 times...ayup. get home at 12:30, rush to a party thingy at hometown buffet, where i ate my heart out. all of it. jamal and i discovered that the more straws you drink with, the more fun it is...i also discovered that spitballs hurt like crap man! got home, took of my pants and PUT ON SHORTS! woooo! after reading for like 3 hours, im now on the computer typing this up. totally awesome dude. in an hour im going to again don the formal dress and go to a colombian gathering...GREAT.    acutally not, im planning to taking my cd player and listening to evil, dark satanic music the whole time as my distant relatives/relatives' familys' friends trying to hug me and tell me how much ive grown...   grr.   im 5' 5''! im so proud now though...i had my doctors appointment a couple days ago, that was an experience. especially the wearing-the-dress-with-little-snowflakes-on-it part. oh and the room with the little bunnies dancing, boarding, and eating pie around the upper corner of the room...*t-twitch* i SWEAR those bunnies were looking at me like seriously.     &nbsp;  Listening To: Skulls - The Misfits ( Walk Among Us )   Reading: Wizards First Rule by Terry Goodkind

       this is my first post on the legacy of izzy blog, considering i did not use the last one very much.   yes well im izzy for those people who enjoy knowing the name of their enemy.   i guess i should start ranting about my day...   so far, i woke up at 9:30. FUN. then, after an intense scratching of the back, and a yawnfest, i got out of bed and ate some cereal, which im still convinced was poisoned. its very slow acting. some of my colleagues from the effigy films movie production company have concocted an idea...nacho cheese chugfest! isnt that splendid? wed have a ref (yours truly), two chuggers, two clowns as entertainers, and an announcerman...john and eriks idea, fun eh?   i went to eriks house last weekend...and, unfortunately, broke his bed.   if you must know, i was NOT, contrary to popular belief, POLE DANCING, but i was swinging on his bedpost. yes...well details were withheld, and izzy was not available for comment friday.   anyhoo fun stuff, i hope this blog will go places. like new zealand n stuff. so syonara until like tomoroowwwwww....

      HAAHHAHA YEAH RIGHT  school officially starts in about 6 days, how annoying is that??   my main thoughts on school involve both positive and negative sides on this...first off, school isnt that bad...its school i guess, i mean we need it to become succesfull rich people in the future, so i can see where they are going. i honestly think that they should make school longer, with the contition being to eliminate homework. i think homework is by far the worst aspect of this place they call school. schools kinda cool, cuz i get to c my friends (those people who claim to be my friends, at least) and i suppose actually learning things isnt to bad...but homework. *shudder* this is the evil incarnate...this year however, ive decided to imprint some tips in my mind for an easier, if more working, school day.   1. DO HOMEWORK IN CLASS. in the words of my cousin eduardo, a college freshman this year, "dude, you'll always have a stupid class. just do it in that... and in class, so you hav a free day for the rest."   thats really all there is...and all that "dont procrastinate" crap...which acually isnt crap...grr.   ive decided on starting water polo...not cuz its the sport for dorks and rejects, which it isnt so much, i am a relatively ok swimmer, and anything having to do with water i will eagerly jump to,...of course there is a rope holding me back, that i call "speedo"   this rope has moved however (up to my neck...), making me realize that i have to DEAL WITH IT, or of course use the religious modesty excuse to get something as skintight *shudder*, but at least like shorts grr.   and i have also decided to do swimming as well, just cus its...swimming!   i went to zachs house last saturday, for a "night of scary movies" which, while the movies werent scary, was not dissapointing. we first started it with the bad seed, a 1956 movie which apparently was the story of a little girl turned evil,....very black and white, not scary.   then, we watched the shining, based on stephen king's book, which is pretty great, if mildly freaky, and VERY confusing...im still figuring it out,...and trying to get redrum out of my head....then we watched identity <>   The Bad Seed:  its black and white. there is no more to say.    The Shining:  freaky, very random, and very weird. great movie.    Identity : fantastic, to say the least, a great twist ending, and a very violent movie, if not so scary.

       grr im soo tired...i went to sleep no earlier than 3 in the morning on the last 4 nights...   night one...thursday: tyler comes over. we watched gladiator and talk about assorted subjects until 4 o' clock in the morning.    night two...friday: uncle arif came over for the first time in a while...that was great we slept at 3 cuz we were talking so late. of course, they got to our house at 1:30 so its not that long. to pass the time we saw braveheart that night...really great movie.   night three...saturday: amir came over after being in england all summer...that was heka fun then he slept over, we talked for a while too...   night four...sunday:  went to johns house, chillediz with ryan there...went to the movies to see anchorman and the villiage. went to macaroni grill (wow that place RULES) and then went back to his house.   there we watched not another teen movie, the butterfly effect, hellboy, and jackass: the movie. went to sleep at 4: 30 wow and then woke up at 10:30 man im TIRED, but ill live, cuz i gotta go to amirs house tonight too.  REVIEWS!!   Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy : possibly the stupidest movie on the face of the earth...it gives kung pow a run for its money cuz its so stupid. however, i dont think ive ever fallen out of my chair laughing before, so its humor (VERY stupid humor) makes up for it. Will Ferrel is SO freaking hilarious (they make fun of retarded ppl! how screwy is that???)    The Villiage : All the "The scariest movie you will ever see" stuff is total CRAP. its not even as scary as signs...however, its better than that movie. (I didnt like signs so much). umm its a pretty decent movie, its got a good idea and everything, but the ending ruined the movie. its a twist, simliar to the rest of the movies that this dude directed, but not nearly as the one in the sixth sence (even thought the one in the others was WAY better)    Not Another Teen Movie : its another teen movie, what is there to say?    The Butterfly Effect : REALLY REALLY good. An amazing concept, with a great storyline. however, its really twisted, wrong and sick. One of the best movies i have ever seen, by far.    Hellboy : Didn't finish it, it looked pretty decent to tell the truth though...kinda random violence w/ a plot.     Jackass The Movie : STUPID, kinda funny, its an alright movie. RANDOM is the word.   Listening to: Horror Hotel - The Misfits   Reading: DUH! The Stupid History of the Human Race

       Hello dahling....since the last post i havent exactly done much. Today's topic will be: lyrics! and here are some great ones to inspire you to do something worthwile....like write a book or something....   World Without Melody - Bad Religion:   I don't want to live/ in a world without melody/ sometimes the rhythmic din/ of society is too much for me/ but purpose is prioritized these days,/ the goal is win the prize/ there's a sleeping resonance we hold/ through which we're unified/ so let it out! don't just get lost in the crowd/ no one can deter you from your own path/ there's no trip too remote/ from which you can't come back/ and I've got this hunch about you and me/ none of us are ready/ for a world without melody/ melody is the key/ it's the surest way/ to unlock your individuality/ melody is the key/ it will set you free!/ don't disrelish harmony/ community will make you whole/ work and understanding are the chords/ way deep within your soul/ they only need to be struck once,/ and the vibrations swell and spread/ but if we mute them they decay,/ our sensibilities are dead/ so let it out! don't just be one of the crowd/ hesitance and diffidence will do you in/ and your soul doesn't care/ for social medicine/ and I've got this hunch/ about you and me/ none of us are ready/ for a world without melody...I won't Live without melody...   Well there you have it, there are some great lyrics. kinda long, but nonetheless interesting. i have discovered that the whole World War 2 thing is really overdone...i dont know if anyone has noticed, but there are a LOT of world war two GAMES, for one, and movies, propaganda, etc i mean dont get me wrong, but still its like a good song ruined by playing it too much on the radio! *stops and pants for breath* i mean COME ON!   yeah anyways, amir is comin back from england on the seventh which is gonna b pretty cool, and vanessas commin back I DONT CARE WHEN from pakistan, that is gonna be pretty cool too. and zaras comin back from pakistan i have no idea when but yeah....i GUESS that will be cool too.
