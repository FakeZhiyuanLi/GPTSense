      Hello friends, foes, and faggamuffins! Welcome to El Blog. I bet you're wondering how this blog came to be. What is its innate purpose? Is the world ready for it? Where can I get a good ham sandwhich at 2am?   The truth is this. Last night, I was walking my scottydog, Monty, with x-large inside-out baggie ready in hand and a mountain of frustration building. It always takes Monty at least 20 mintues to find the perfect patch of grass to excrete his waste matter upon. This is because he knows the very second that last tappering chunk hits the ground he will be whiplashed across the lawn back up into the apartment (well, ok, a slight pause as my bagged hand scoops up his hot, steaming pile). Anyway, last night, he was really taking his time. It had been 35 minutes and we had yet to find the night's sanctuary of defecation. Just as I was about to give up all hope and line the livingroom with newspaper and Bush campaign posters, he popped a squat. It was  THEN!  when I bent over to collect the night's batch that it  hit me . Yes, that one delayed missle-launched chunk,   but also   an idea!  Create my very own Blog!  And so here it is. As for the other questions, folks, I have no answers. I just ask them.

      Oh yeah. I forgot that I'm supposed to write in this thing every week. Thanks, Beth for reminding me. Really, I'm just waiting to upgrade it with ghetto bootilicious FX before I unveil it. Beth is supposed to help me with that since she's the blogmaster.  I saw the Bourne Supremecy last night. Ehh. The first one was more dimentional. This one was just pure action, jackson.  And what's up with Michael Jackson having quads?

      Sometimes I have a strong desire to understand this stuff and other times I'm just like... I want a sandwich.  For some great democratic humor, check out www.seeyageorge.com

      Ok...so I'm slowly getting this whole HTML crap. I've even got some links now. Hopefully I can figure out how to futher fancify my blog with some pics n' flashy stuff.  And by "figure out" I mean ask Beth. Frick! It's 2am and it's a work nite. I guess I'll hurl myself down the stairs so I don't have to go in tomorrow. Yea!!! No work!!!
