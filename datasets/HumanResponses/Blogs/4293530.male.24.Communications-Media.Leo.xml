      This being my first Post blog (Whatever you call it) I am not really sure what I am going to write about. A little voice is saying inside me "How can you say you don't know what you going to write about when you already have put the title to you blog" My response to this 'little voice'is to "put a sock in your mouth, now is my time" This simply meaning I can write anything I want to write. No matter how silly or stupid it may seem.In honest truth, I do know what I want to write as it is all in my mind. Its just that I do not know how to go about it. So in other words, they is an element of truth in what the little voice is saying.   I guess what makes mefeel  uncomfortable is how do I go about writing whats on my mind? Is it really important? Anyway who cares to know what tha  heck I am thinking? Or well... I will give it a bash. It doesn't hurt.  Living in Cape Town South Africa is one of the best things ever.Especially if one lives next to the sea. "Why do I say that?" (I can almost hear the stupid little voice asking me.)  The best thing about living in Cape Town is when you live next to the see you get to have many wonderful experiences with a varied set of people. This evening I went to litle resturant by the habour called Kalkies (Named after the little village I leave in, Kalk Bay.....Mmmm I think thats the reson I might be wrong though)After our Calamary meal we took a walk around the habour and strange enough lots of memories strated to pop up.It was crazy. I felt they were so tangible. Memories of people I have spent my time with. However one that alomost felt real was time I spent with a friend of mine.   One boring Friday evening we decided to take a walk to the habour. We spent such a long time at the habour bridge talking about a whole lot of things from politics to relationships. With our backs flat on the ground, facing the stars up the sky, a cool breeze of wind blowing and the beautiful roar of the sea. We just talked and talked and laughed a lot. The world felt so small then. Felt like we were the only two people in this big blue planet of ours  Okay!!!!! The 'little' voice is probably saying "So what???? Whats so amazing about that?"   To me the big deal is that,you never realise it when a special moment is slowly being created in specific situations. Especially if you are with a person you care about a lot. You never realise that the enviroment you are in is setting you up for what I would like to call a 'golden nostalgic' moment in the making that will forever be scribed in your heart.  Walking this evening next to the sea reminded me of the time I spent with this good freind of mine. Not just because she was drop dead gorgeous or anything (MMmmmmmm I lie thats part of it) But because of the enviroment of the sea a habour. Its as if God recreated the whole atmospheare to remind me of her and the silly little talks we shared together. Furthermore this has made me aware of the importance of people I meet in my life  and the need to cherish the 'golden nolstagic' moments in the making. You never know if you will ever get that opportunity again.   I guess in conclusion "Memories and Enviroments" are intertwinned. Next time you spend time with someone, beware of your enviroment, it might just be setting you up for a 'golden nostalgic moment' Trust me I know.  Thats so cool my first blog. Mmmmmm wonder who reads this stuff.    NK Cape Town South Africa
