      I have interesting friends, that read interesting books, and make me read them (litterally) so then my mom will ask me why I've locked myself up in my room and am yelling for complete silence, so that I can understand the entirety of these books (which include Sophie's World, the Davinci code, etc.) so actual thinking books. My mom will wish to hear about them and then will want to read them when I'm finsihed. The only problem is I use my books, they never look new by the time I've finished reading them. I take notes in them, I underline things I like and put little tabs on the pages, yes this might be a good habbit to keep up, but it makes it so no one can ever read the same book I have in fear of disturbing my precious little tabs. Then they're stuck, because they don't want to have to buy the book again, so they go unread. To make matters worse, I've never once looked at the tabs again. I mean I'm sure if I did I could find some philisophical reason behind why I may have found that interesting at the time, but even if I did I'll never be able to find it again. Then I have an idea of a filing cabinet system. I want to buy a huge filling cabinette and rip out pages where I want things to be, so that I can label them and be able to go back and look at them again when I have an idea. No worries, I'll never tear apart my precious books. Then I have the idea of photocopying pages instead of riping them out, but you can never really get everythig to turn out and that would take a lot of time, effort, and paper. So now what? Keep them in some randome place in the house in hopes of one day remembering the exact book, in the exact page that I need at this exact moment. Not going to happen! So then (again) I'm back to my dilema. I could make use of my bookshelf and put every book I own in alphabetical order by name (because I can never remember the author) and make a huge list of all the pages I want to remember, what book their in, and what it's about. Then make little tables categorizing each section until I get down to a single entry in a book.  That sounds good alright? The only problem is sometimes I know there's something I'm trying to find in a certain book, so I'd have to also categorize things by book (aka: I'd need a subject list and a book list that both have the book and subject just the order switched)  Now we have 2 lists, 2 categories, no filing cabinet, millions of books, and a broken laptop that should be fixed any day.  The problems with this: I don't know where all my books are, I'd have to go through the entire house, clean my room, clean my bookshelf to try and make room for this monstrocity, and above all that go through every single book (basically read them again) and try to find every bit of information I'd ever find useful. This would take all of next summer.  So I'll do it them (aka: NEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)

      There is no other spelling for "O" other than oh, which isn't what I'm trying to get at. The "O" I mean is the "O" in the alphabet.  Now that we have that straightened out I'd like to state a pet peve I have. When giving a number, like a phone number or something I  haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate  it when people say Zero instead of "O" when refering to a 0 (the one that's the number). I know it's pronounced Zero, but I hate it when people say it! They put enfasis on the "e" so it's more like Zeeero, or "Zoro" with an e. You've got that extra "eeeeeeeeeeeeee" sound. Then they usualy say it louder than the others. 9 0 6 25 0  try it!  a 123: 7 0 3 223: 63 0   lol ok I'm stopping, but try it with "O" (the oh sound/ letter)  a 123: 703 223: 630  Better huh? ^_^ thought so

      Alright I used to LOOOOVE Barney, I don't know why, it's a horribly painful show to watch now. I don't see why it's still on the air, of course I was like 5 and had a brain the size of a small mushroom that may have explodded. My dad hated it, and do this day doesn't know why I liked it, says they had the same kids that just kept getting older and is glad to know that they've been fired. Why or how he knows that I don't want to know, along with why he's named the neighbor cats "bootsy" and "pooky". But aperently now they have new little gay brats! Yeah they had to be gay, I mean from the part of the song that I remember it's a really gay show. Which leads to my point!  So I haven't watched the damn thing since I was 5 and suddenly have that stupid little song stuck in my head. "I love you! You love me! We're a happy family, with a great big hug and a kiss from me to you! Something something something too!" I think it's like the end of like the abc's or something, "next time won't you sing it too!" or some bullshit like that.

      By the title I gave this you pry won't even read it anyway, but when you know the people I know the movies can be quite fun.  7 of us whent to see The Village the other day, 3 of us had already seen it.   Person 1 that's seen it-  Talks throughout the entire movie, then when what's his face gets stabbed he feels obligated to yell "STAB HIM AGAIN! STAB HIM AGAIN!" and chear when he gets stabbed. He also talked throughout the entire movie and jumped over the hand rail on front of us twice.   Person 2 that's seen it-  Loves it and wants to be the one stabbing person #1   Person 3 that's seen it-  Sat on the other side of our group, so I'm not sure what she did. Liked the movie.     Person 4 that hasn't seen it-  She invited us all, and being a writer, couldn't help but comment on how she could have written a better movie.     Person 5 that hasn't seen it-  Me. Laughing at person #1 and wanting to stab him too, talking to person #2 throughout the entire thing and commenting on how poorly it was done, and almost telling person #4 to hit person #1 for me.   Person 6 that hasn't seen it-  The only guy other than person #1.   Person 7 that hasn't seen it-  Curling up next to person #6, only toying with him though, she won't go out with him even though he wants her to.   If you haven't left by now you've come to the best part! After the movie! All of us whent to Subway and sat outside a movie store across the street from Sheries and by 2 different gas stations, except for person #1 and 2.  Everyone left except me is in a Harry Potter Roleplay where everyone has been raped, Harry and Hermione are dating (aside fromt he fact that they're both being played by straight girls- Person #3 and 7), there are 2 guys, and none of them are dating in real life.  After Person #3 and 7 left, and we finally stopped talking about they're role play Person #6 and I threw grass at eachother, which didn't really work for me becuase the wind blew in my direction so any grass I threw at him hit me and all he had to do was pick it up and I'd get grass all over me.  We only had a few minutes until our mom's would be there, so it didn't seem so stupid at the time. Then I got to run into his mom, who was my English teacher last year, which was a little weird.

       Alright I'm not a perv or anything, but my step dad whent up stairs into my mom's room (which is also his room now, but I don't like to acknowledge that) so my mom's room is right next to the computer I'm on and my step dad goes in. No big deal right? I don't know why he whent in there, I don't really pay any attention to him so long as I know where he is and can stay as far away from him as humanely possible! I don't have the radio on like I usually do, so I can hear a lot more than I usually can which is probably why I noticed this. He flushes the toilet and COMES RIGHT OUT! HE DOESN'T WASH HIS HANDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now i've started paying attention, and it's not a fluke accident, he NEVR washes his hands after going to the bathroom. Now HE may be ok with that, but I'M SURE AS HELL NOT! Therefor anything he may have touched I now cannnot. Plus I'm kind of Mysophobic (my路so路pho路bi路a An abnormal fear of dirt or contamination.) So don't tell me there are millions of little germs living on me, in me, and around me TRUST ME! I KNOW!!!!!!!!

We were eyeing eachother for the two days we were there, or more he was probably watching me trying to figure out why the hell I'm watching him...Anyway! He was everywhere we seemed to be  ^_^  My mom called him a real loser and said they   (him and his purple haired friend)   kept stiking to us   ;)   nothing wrong with that! His friend had nice abs though...Cute head or nice abs...? MMMMMmmmmmmmmmm I can just have em both!    Spikey Haired Dude:      Hair:  long  (at least for a guy!)  , brown hair that he'd used a lot of gell to spike about 13 times    Clothes:  military paints, black shirts   (even when he was in the Ocean)  , black shorts with flames on em....uh....lol that's all i remember!      Purple Haired Dude:      Hair:  short, purple  Clothes:  funky vest, red bandana with a skull on it over his butt  (yes I was looking!)  , That's all I remember  :P

      How do you know when the world has too much time on its hands and no good deseases to cure?  "Do you feel sad?" "On an average men are sad 3.5 days a month and woman 4.5 days." "Depression can cause health risks!" "Do you feel down or worry about little things?" *cries* my bf died of depression! How can you ask that????????? "Then you need -some lame ass drug-!!!!!!!!!!" "Take this drug and you'll be happy!!!!!!!" "We can make you smart" O_o "Self cleaning cloths!"  This is what happens.....We're taught drugs are bad "YOU'RE DEPRESSED!!!!!!!! YOU NEED DRUGS!!!!!!!!!!! HAPPY! HAPPY!!!! HAAAAAAAAAAAPPY!!!!!!!!!!!!"  It's just like..."Dude chill out! We all get sad sometimes, but you don't need to fill me up with pills for a non-existant Medical Problems! Maybe we wouldn't be depressed if you stopped telling us we are....You're the ones worrying us....Maybe YOU need the help! Everyone's now freaking out about how you might have -such and such- disease, so you gain money giving them anxiety pills, just to get them depressed because their life is lousy and give them pills for depression....I'm serious here! All our movies are depressing and all we hear about on tv is war, then on top of that the depression! pills, what do you think's going to happen to us?????"  Isn't it funny how drugs sound a lot better when you call them pills? o_O   "Lack of physical activity will kill you sooner than smoking!" "People that excercise are less likely to be depressed!"  BECAUSE THEY'RE HIGH OR ASLEEP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

       When your dog is licking your face as most dogs enjoy doing did you ever really stop to think of where your dog's tongue has been recently? They have a vast fascination for putting things in their mouths as a pup and at least my dog's tongue is quite distastefull! Here are the top 5 things that may be in the saliva now on your cheek.           What your dog might have been chewing on:      1)Chewies/ Dog Toys.   How often do you wash your dog's toys? They've been dragged around the yard, the house,  in  their mouths, in your hands, etc. This goes dubble for any hard edible item your dog will knaw on (aka: chewies!) These, being edible, you never clean and around my house they'll last for a while...    2)They're furr.   Now you might not think that's such a big deal, dogs need a way to itch themselfves properly and for some reason my dog always uses it's teath to bite at it's furr, BUT what do you think your dog's been rolling in? All that is now on your dog's furr and in it's mouth.    3)Beds.   Be it dog beds, your bed, the couch, anywhere your dog sleeps or lays on. It gets everything your dog's been rolling in on, watch them, they like to chew on fabrics.    4)Closets.   Look into your closet, look at EVERYTHING your dog can get at, dirty clothes, old boxes, old halloween constumes, extra sheets, boxes, bags, shoes, etc. Now how long have they been in there? How much dust is there? What might be living in a dark closet behind closed doors, anything worse would be in your bathroom where it's damp. But when I look into my closet, my dog can get at things I haven't touched for about 4 years and I for one wouldn't want to get that all over me.    5)Hair Brushes.   They loooooooooooooove to chew on hair brushes, which have all your hair care products in them!!!!!!! Not good for your dog, but better for your cheek than some things.             What your dog may have been rolling in:      1)Waste.   Alright now your dog doesn't go to the bathroom on itself but it does go in the lawn and no one's out there with some soap cleaning their lawn, so even if you pick up after your dog when it poos, you never get it all! Those of you that have tried to potty train a dog, you know when it goes in the house it takes more than picking it up to get it clean! So watch out when your dog has been lounging around the lawn.       2)Fertelizer.   Any products you put on your plants or lawn are now infesting your you and your dog.      3)Bed.   Yes I've said that before, but your dog is also rolling around in it's bed, which has past things  your  dog has been chewing on aswell.      4)Floors.   We walk on it! Need I say more?      5) Playgrounds.   Though this doesn't happen much, when I go for walks with my dogs they'll lay down when we get to the school and Austin (who usually comes with me) and I will sit on the swings and they'll get all those germs on them. Uck, Elementary School Germs!!           What your dog may have eaten:      1)Tampons.   My dogs eat used tampons. Enough Said.    2)Poop.   My dogs like to eat other animal's poop. Need I say more?    3)Garbage.   My dog LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVES to eat garbage, well that isn't so great for them! We throw it away for a reason....This one can be avoided by throwing things out in a garbage can out of reach of your dog, and no the ones where you step on the thing to open the lid don't work!!!!4)Bed. I know I mentioned this earlier, but it's true, your dog has also been rolling around in it's bed aswell as chewing on it!    4) Toothbrushes.   My dogs love to eat toothbrushes, which probably doesn't sound too bad, but germs need 3 things, food, water, and darkness. Basically it's a breading ground for super germs.        5)Pens/ Pencils/ Crayons/ Markers.   My dog LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVES to eat them, not just chew on them EAT THEM. You've touched them, usually they've rolled around on the floor, etc.

      My dog BITES, maybe not really hard most of the time, but still, a bite's a bite. The thing with him is it's never an ordinary bite. He'll wrap his front legs around yours cling to you and bite you SEVERAL times. He'll calm down -eventualy- and then lay down on your  legs and fall asleep, again making it so you can't rid of him -_- I think he's got split personalities.....

      We have a new puppy and it's taken us 3 months to try and potty train him. So far he still goes in the house and is scared of the doggy door, BUT he'll go in the bathroom! If only we could teach him to use the toilette....*sigh* I'm beginning to wonder who let him watch them go to the bathroom....

       Alright time to freak, I just saw the date  TOMORROW is my sister's B-Day, why tomorrow???????? I have a hard time knowing what today is! Normally this wouldn't be a problem seeing *caugh* I don't give gifts *caugh*  but my mom is going to take me shopping with her to buy her some :P Th  at means I have to:      -kick the dog off my lap-get up-find clean clothes on my floor that isn't my floor because it has been devoured by all my shit and is uncleanable (now it's getting some strange oder and I can no longer go inside without gagging, naturally I now sleep on the couch.)      -then I gotta put makeup on and as EVERYONE knows I wear too much makeup -goth here, so it's all black- Actualy some of it is now blue and green now which no one really gets and somehow makes me interesting. I donno, at my freaked out school I'm actualy starting trends....It's kinda creapy...My entire life I've tried NOT to be popular and now people are copying me  I don't get it, I never will get it, you people all suck -_-      -Then I gotta do my hair which consists of putting on a hat. I have tuns of hats and people say I look weird without one. It's a good way of covering up my hair, which really isn't hair it's a poodle, all poofy and shit.  Yeah I'm a dork, I'm worrying about my hair. I make fun of people that worry about their hair.         So there you have it, all my getting ready before my mom drags me off to some weird ass place I don't wanna be. Wost of all I get 10 minutes to do all this.  You're still a dumbass. Yeah I know, I'm a gothic, dork, that cares about how I look, and hates anyone remotely like me.

       For you and all the mindless zombies I made up that read this I have seen aliens on Mars. They're pink fluffy and wanted to trade me their world for a hot dog, of course I declined. WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU DO THAT?????????? Because Fred their idea of fun is to play with Pretty Pink Poney crap and well I'm more concerned with the Aliens on the Sun, which really isn't a Sun, It's a hallagram and sunlight really is Alien beems out to read our minds, only us pale kids know the truth! They're having allections for king and I'm running. I'm doing surprisingly well too, they seem to be quite interested in my plan for world domination. The only reason I'm losing votes is because I've promised half of it to Sam. I'm sure they'd like him if they got to know him! No not really, they're a gang of sexist pigean like creatures that would rather eat him. How I've survived the world may never know!          Now it's time for another comment by our good pal Fred!  You're an idiot you know that? You couldn't tell a pig you were sane.      *flies off on my heard of pigs*

       Ok I live in AMERICA the most fucked up country in the world, how do I know that? WATCH!!!!!!!!      -I was trying to buy a pair of pants and I'm pretty small, ok I'm the second smallest person in my grade  I'm 4'11" wear a size 0-1 pant and weigh like 100 pounds  Yeah I know I'm short for a ninth grader  Don't rub it in!  no scratch that :P We need new fonts here...Anywho I tried on two size 1 pants and they're too big! I mean they didn't even used to make a size one pant and now our youth is so fricken small they can't even wear a size one pant!!!!      -The next conclusion I can come to is there are too many fat people (no offense to the overweight, and no I'm not talking I'M 120 OMG! I'M SO FAT!  What the fuck are you talking about? You're NOT fat! I know someone that's 5'4 and looks best and 120, any less and he just looks frail. What I'm talking the people in their 30's weighing like 300 pounds. So now there are all these new diets and shit.  Yeah I know you love diets, well why not just eat whatever the hell you feel like and don't give a shit? BECAUSE YOU CARE TOO MUCH WHAT OTHER PEOPLE THINK!!!!!!!!!!  Yeah you know what I'm talking about, I CAN'T WEAR THIS!!!!!!!!! SO-AND-SO WORE THIS LAST YEAR!!!!!!!!  Frankly I don't give a shit. Do what you wanna do YOU'LL BE MUCH HAPPIER!!!!!!!!!!! Trust me, been there done that and if anyone doesn't like you for who you are then they really aren't worth knowing  TRUST ME! A good friend once told me that fat people are happier than the rest of us, which is probably why we were being miserable together! So why would we make sizes bigger so they can feel better about themselves? They're the happy ones...      -  Hate Crimes. I never got hate crimes, I mean why would you commit a crime without hating that person? Just making them "hate crimes" is being pregudice.  You're just making the minorities stand out more!  They're all hate crimes and it's supposed to be beneficial to minorites so they're not being like racist, but just by doing that aren't you being racist?  RACIST BASTARDS! Wait....wasn't I jsut pregudice against them?  So maybe we're always going to offend someone if we try to or not!!!!!!!!!

      Ok I FINALLY got the Beatles, no stupid I didn't "get" them I mean I understand them! I don't know, I can't explain it! I just had an awesome fealling while listening to an all beatles marathon or some crap like that and after listening to their songs for like 20 minutes I had some freaky realisation. I ACTUALY RELATED TO THESE PEOPLE!!!! I understood something I'll pry never understand how to explain what I understood :P  It made me think about how the way someone I know used to be, but they've changed and I can't change em back...  again. But anyway, I just felt...I don't know happy in a weird sort of way.  Any of you that know me know I don't like Nike, why? Well now I have two reasons and the second one is in regards to the Beatles.  The simplest reason is A. A)I'm not an active person, therefor I have no use for anything Nike might sell.  But then there's the slightly more complicated B. B)The Beatles never wanted any of their songs used in advertising, then the rights of them were sold to Micheal Jackson. The idiot that he is he got one used in a Nike commercial. This was,  like I said earlier,   A BIG DEAL TO THE BEATLES! None of them have spoken to them since, there is a vast hatred towards Micheal Jackson in the Beatles fans, and I being one of them am greatly oblidged to dislike Nike for using a Beatles song knowing they wouldn't like it and socialising with Micheal Jackson.

       Just because I'll never love you, and with any luck you'll never love me DOESN'T mean I can't give advice ^_^ It's really stupid but hey, you don't have to read it.      How do you know you're in love? How do you know someone's in love with you? Can someone love you without ever having ever met you? Will there ever be an answer? Well I think I'm gonna try!     -How do you know you're in love?-    I don't know...I've never trully been in love, all i've heard is you just know! It's a meraculous feeling where a certain person who is all you want. The only thing is, you can think you're in love but until you trully find it, you won't know that you really weren't before. Finding that right person...oh god that's a completely different topic.    -How do you know someone's in love with you?-    One day they say it and something clicks and you know. You know they're not just saying it and they really want to be with you, but that's the same moment you know you love them or not and if it's no, it's a really big no...it feels horrible, like someone ripped out both your hearts and they see it too. The way they act...they're heartbroken...it's horrible  they seem so alone. As the bartender said in Win a Date With Tad Hamilton "There's three kinds of love." Then I can't exactly quote her but there's love you get over in a month, love you get over in a year, and real love that changes your life and you'll never really get over... That's what love is and to have that ripped out from under you... Have pitty on them, they'll never really love again.    -Can someone love you without ever having ever met you?-    Yeah, that's the real love, love without a face or a name, the only problem is you don't know if the person you love is real. If that image you have is trully a person that lives and breathes. I wouldn't suggest it...but it's a way to know if they really love you, no sex, kisses, hugs. If you really do meet them and they're not who they think you are or things change...well it wasn't true love or you're gonna be heart broken for the rest of your life.    -Is there really someone out there for all of us?-    No. Some of us die alone, there is no cosmic being out there making love happen for everyone. It's like the tooth fairy, it's there to make you feel better. When you lose a tooth things are weird, sometimes it hurts, there's no tooth, it's just different, so there's the tooth fairy that controls it all and makes us feel better, makes it a good time.  What would we do without her? Why else would we want to loose teath? Well it's that way with love, it makes us feel better thinking love will happen for all of us, but what if it doesn't? Then we're all heartbroken...In both casses with the tooth fairy and love it's just there for our sake, for us to feel better about ourselves. Just look at reality; our parents are the tooth fairy and some of us die alone and unloved.    -Can you lose that one true love?-    Yeah, you can have it all and not realise it, that one person you know you're supposed to be with for the rest of your life you can lose and then never have them back. Like I said, some people die alone. Then you can have the one person you trully love, take advantage of them and lose them, you're still together...just not really there...You can't have it forever and if you're one of the lucky few that do...well then you're the happiest person on earth.    -Now for the question you all want to know, why am I writing this? Was I bored? Did I fall in love? Who ripped my heart from my chest?-    No, lol did you honestly think I'd ever fall in love? No. Good. Right answer. I was just bored out of my mind. So.....HA!

       Don't you hate it when you ask like 8 questions and the person mails you back and doesn't answer a single one  I mean what the hell are you supposed to say then?      1) ANSWER MY FUCKING QUESTIONS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   2) Reask the questions in hopes they'll actualy answer this time.   3) Bite them.   4) Find something completely unrelated to say and forget you ever asked.   5) Call them a dumbass for not following your instrctions.   6) Hit yourself in the head because you knew they wouldn't answer your questions and think you're an idiot for even trying.   7) Politely cuss them out    .....Well now what? ANSWER MY QUESTIONS! lol! ^_^

       Awkward ways to wake up:Yeah that's what I said!   Now shut up and pay attention      1-When you wazke up in the middle of the night, don't know what time it is, are too out of it to notice how dark it is outside, but know you haven't gotten much sleep.      2-When your watch says 9 but you're freaking out because you think it says 11, then figure out what time it is and don't know how you added on another digit.      3-When you're physically awake but still dreaming, I convinced myself scratching my bug bite would help, I "woke up" when it hurt!      4-When you wake up at 11 and 3 hours later cana't for the life of you figure out what you did all day.      5-When you wake up at 5, think EVERY CLOCK IN THE HOUSE says 6, so you drag yourelf out of bed, get dressed, and don't notice everyone else is still in bed. Then someone finally gets up and asks why on earth you're out of bed AND dressed.         I have personally experienced all of them and don't wish to ever again. The first to all this morning  and half of number 3 which happened yesterday, it just didn't take me 3 hours to figure out my day was over and then suddenly looked at my watch properly and decidded it was going to be 9 instead.    P.S. Any time I've ever slept in to 11 was recently BECAUSE I'M VERY SLEEP DEPRIVED!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't go to bed till 3 AM sooooooo 34567891011 that's 9 hours of sleep!!!! Only an hours worth of sleep more than I should in one night! So things balance out    P.P.S. Is it with two P's or two S's????????  Myabe it's with none....    S. No I think I like adding P's!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Creap.    P.P.P. Where am I? .....OH YEAH! P.S. .....I think.... Oh well!  Now what was I going to say...............    P.P.P.P.P.S. I FIGURED IT OUT!!!!!!!!!!!    P.P.P.P.P.S. I hope to add to this list soon, do you have any strange stories?  Oh.... and I missed a P.... so P.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      Why do we punish the laugh by giving it one L to each O, but then the last one  (or the first one if you're going to br picky!)   has two L's per O. Alright maybe I've lost you now, so I'll break it up for you:    example:   lolololololololol      but in reality this is what w e're doing to it!:   LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL   So we give ourselves the false concept of laughing when you only laugh once and say "LO" a lot....HAHA!  Now "haha" works ^_^ there aren't 3 letters we're merging into two! MUAHAHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAA!  Wow would ya look at that? "muahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaa" works too!  -So why doesn't lol work like the rest? Hmmmmm  (that one works too!)   Well it's quite simple actually.  "lollollollollollol" looks stupid.
