      Got a running question.  In order for me to work on my distance I realize I need to fuel myself with carbrohydrates.  What are quick and easy things I can eat about 20 min before a run.  Is a sport drink  a good substitute for food?  If anyone knows about food and running please help.    Thanks will post train run very soon.  Christy

      Another 3...  Tonight I met my brother (sbobo) around 630 at "our" lake.  There weren't to many people out due to the Lakers game.  When my brother and I run together we start off together but after a mile we start to drift apart then by the end he is waiting for me at the car.  On our second mile my brother was a few feet ahead of me but we were having a conversation as if we were right next to each other.  This lady noticed and made a comment on the distance and thought it was weird that we were carrying on a conversation.  As we past her on the last mile Steve was quite a bit ahead of me, and I screamed to Steve.  The lady thought we were nuts.  I get a kick out of watching people's reaction while I am running.  Great fun.  Weight: 176 Body fat: 38 Quote: I may not be fast, but I am faster than I was yesterday

      I am back and ready to tackle some more asphalt.  After a long break from running I noticed my body becoming less attractive when I looked into the mirror.  I hopped online to find a race to start training for and after searching for the perfect race, I ran across the O.C. Marathon which is taking place on December 5, 2004.  I haven't paid my tuition fee yet but will in the next couple of weeks.  This blog is all about training for the marathon. Enjoy.  My first 3 mile run was a little tough but I made it.  I ran around a 1.1 mile loop around a lake.  I got to the lake around 745 and the weather was perfect.  It was cool and overcast.  I was passed by a lot of runners, and realized I am very slow.  Oh well I at least I am faster than I was yesterday!     Weight: 176 BMI: 26 Quote: I maybe slow, but I am faster than I was yesterday!

      I tried something different before my 3.0 run, I ate!  I only had two cookies and a water but it made a difference.  I was able to run the whole way and my breathing was getting back on track easier.    Saturday I have my first running group meeting.  I get to find out what pace group I will belong to and who will be in my group.  I am nervous, but I am also pretty excited about it.  Hopefully my brother and I will be in the same group, but he is a tad bit faster than I am.    I will keep you posted how things go on Saturday.   Good luck with your long run this weekend.

      I met my brother at lunch and we ran for 30 min (about 3 miles maybe a little less). We ran down a river bed.  It was nice and quiet.  There weren't to many people out and about.  I didn't fuel or hydrate myself well before the run so I had to walk for a short time to re-focus.  Overall it was a nice run.

      I was feeling sluggish all day yesterday (Monday)and was looking forward to my 3.3 mile run.  I started off great.  I kept up with my brother for aprox 1.5 miles and then I ran my own pace trying to get my breathing pattern down.  When trying to work on my breathing I couldn't get enough air and my lungs became a little tight and my throat became super dry.  I did stop for about 20 seconds, but then I re-started and finished the last mile.  I am looking forward to today's run!  Weight: 176 BMI: 25.5

      No running for me for the last couple of days :(.  My best friend of 15 years got married yesterday. On my running days this week I had something to do and I kept putting it (running) off.  Today I am relaxing but I am running tomorrow morning.  So look for a post then.

      Ahhh Thursday, What a beautiful day to run.  At first the weather was cloudy and overcast, however by the end of the run it was becoming a clear warm day.  Nothing to exciting happened on my run.  It was a calm and relaxed 3.3 miles   Wednesday run was a nice one as well.  In fact my brother timed us as we were running and I did 3.3 approximately in 31:29, which is the fastest thus far for that many miles.  I noticed the more I run the easier 3 miles gets.  Depending on what our next week schedule I may boost up to four.     I weighed myself this morning and I came in at 172.  When running weight likes to fluctuate to the extremes.

      Jason posted a question on my blog "So how much running do you have to do at the beginning to train? How many miles a week?"  I am assuming this was about the running group?  We get a weekly schedule on Saturdays.  Considering we had one meeting, this week goes as follows: Mon- 20 min, Tues- 15 min, Wed-rest, Thurs- 20 min, Fri-rest.  The thing I don't like about this weekly schedule thing, is that you don't know how long the long run is.  I am assuming since we did 2 miles on Saturday we will be adding a mile a week, so this week we will probably run 3 miles.    For tonight 3.3 miles I went running with Shania Twain.  I usually don't like running with music, but thought I'd give it a try to see how it went.  My running partner didn't call me back so I did a solo run.  It was a nice night it was pretty clear and a little breezy.  I went running with a early 90's portable CD player, the size of an 8 Trak. It was a bit bulky to run with and it skipped quite a bit, but I stayed on pace, and seemed to have ran faster than normal.  I did like running with music but in order for me to continue with it I need an new updated version of an 8 trak.  If anyone has any suggestions they would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in Advanced.   Quote:  The only person that can push yourself, is YOU!

      I am now part of the Cal Coast Track Club.  I signed up with them to help train for the O.C. Marathon.  Yesterday was the first meeting and they had us separate into groups, if you ran more than 4 miles you go with one group if not you run a mile on the track.  My brother and I ran with the 4 mile group, we ended up doing 2 miles.  My brother and I started of with the 8 min milers.  I was a little nervous since I am not as fast, but went along with the crowd.  I kept up with my brother like usual unitl a mile and half.  He ran two miles in 19:45 (or close to it) I ran it in 20:09.  In order for us to be in the same pace group I neeeded to run it under 20 min.  Oh well, Just like Richard said, "you'll be meeting twice the runners, twice the potential partners for an informal run-together, twice the number of names and faces to greet at local races."   I am excited to see who is in my pace group I am hoping for some "runners" but for some reason I feel like I am with the "walkers".  I guess we will see next saturday!   Enjoy your runs, runs end but running doesn't

      My brother received a H.R.M. for a fathers day present, so last night I ran with him at his pace it was a sub 11.  It felt really good for the both of us.  We are use to running all out and be dying by the end of each run.  We both could have done easily 6 miles, but I was afraid of re-injuring my shin so we stopped after 3 miles.  I get to run with my group on Saturday, my long run is 3 miles, so it should be a breeze.

      I had a lot of negative energy tonight so I put on my running gear and hopped in the car.  At first I was just going to drive down PCH and I did for about 1/2 hour.  Then I was on my way home when my car ended up at my training lake.  It was the best run I have had in a long time.  I was in the zone the whole time until one guy yelled you are slowing down, so I picked up the pace a little and my legs were feeling great.  I could have done more than 3.3 but since I already ran earlier today I didn't' want to push it.  I ran 3.3 in 29.44 according to runnersworld.com that's a 9:01 min/mile and I was running at a 6.66 miles/hour.  I have never ran that fast in my life!  Man did it feel great.   Happy running

      Saturday at our running pace group they gave us a schedule for the rest of the 23 weeks of training (or something in that time frame)and during the week we run for time and on Saturdays for distance.  I don't like running for time.  I feel like I don't run as much as I do for distance.  Today I ran for 20 min and I felt like it was a waste of time.  This whole week except for Saturday will be running at most 25 min.  I know the time and mileage will work its way, I guess I have to be patient and do what the doctors order so I wont' get injured, again.  Its hard however right when you get in your groove you need to stop running.

      WATER, WATER, and WATER.  That is the one thing i learned today on my long 4.0 mile run today with my pace group.  With out water I was lightheaded and had a hard time finishing my run.  There was a hill that i wanted to walk on, but i didnt' allow myself the glory. I trudged through the the run to a nice finish.  If you don't want to be dying on your runs drink WATER and stay well HYDRATED!

      After last nights 4.4 my legs just didn't want to work tonight.  I planned to do 3.3 as usual but I ended up only doing 2.2 miles.  My legs were lead filled tonight.  I will try again for 3.3 on Friday.

      I am back from my mini vacation.  I am pretty bummed with myself conisedering I had every intention to run while i was in Vegas.  When i stepped outside the heat grabbed onto me and i wasn't prepared to run in the high temps of 106.  I didn't bring any water or anything to dehydrate myself, so I walked back into the casino, up to my room, and layed on my bed thinking about my next run.  Today, I made up for the run I missed yesterday.  The temperature was much more comfortable to run in.  I did my first 4.4 miler since my injury back in November. I started off pretty slow and picked it up a notch on the last mile.  It was a good work out.  I finished in 44:30 (10:07 pace).  Thinking about running is no where close to actually running!

I won't be back until Wednesday or Thursday.  But I will post when I get back.  Today's run 3.3 miles (again) in approximately 30:57.  On Tuesday I plan to run 4.0 miles and 4.0 on Thursday, and 3.3 on Friday.  My training schedule has us running 5 days a week till the marathon.  So I will be posting more often.    Have a great week and train strong!  Look forward to reading all your blogs when I return from Vegas!

          Saturday's long run was very peaceful.&nbsp; I went running with my group and my partner and I took off.&nbsp; We were so ahead of our group that they weren't behind us.&nbsp; We knew we went the right way because we passed them on our way back (out and back).&nbsp; I tried some new things.&nbsp; I wore shorts again, I think I need to find another pair I have been wearing biking shorts and they don't breathe.&nbsp; I had a peanut butter toast for breakfast and it didn't bother me at all.&nbsp; I wore a hat, the hat was the best thing.&nbsp; It kept the sweat from dripping in my eyes and made me feel cooler, if that makes any sense.&nbsp; Lastly I had my water!&nbsp; I learned my lesson from last week.&nbsp; Water saved me this week.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  My goal for this run was to make it under and hour and I did with five min. To spare. My partner and I did our 5 miler in 55 min.&nbsp; Not bad for a Saturday long slow distance!  &nbsp;  Enjoy your runs this week.&nbsp;

      I woke up this morning and laid in bed for 30 min turned on the TV while having an argument with myself about running now or waiting till later.&nbsp; I argued for about 20 min and I finally got dressed and went out for a 30 min run.&nbsp; I was fighting to go because my normal route is getting very monotonous.&nbsp; I was trying to figure out where to run so it wouldn't be so boring&nbsp;and I found the perfect spot.&nbsp; I drove about 15-20 min to&nbsp;Dana Point Harbor.&nbsp; It was one of the most beautiful runs I have ran in a long time.&nbsp; I took my time running around the boats and the water breaks and&nbsp;made a point to say "good morning" to all the other passer buyers.&nbsp; I made sure to have fun with the run instead&nbsp;of making it a chore.&nbsp; I am back showered and am not sluggish.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like&nbsp;I can topple the world.&nbsp; Can't wait for tomorrows run and Saturday's long run.  &nbsp;  Someone in the world is training when you are not, when you race him&nbsp;he will win.&nbsp; Get off your butt and RUN!!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Tuesday night, man to me they are the best running days.  I get too run twice in a row then a rest.  I seem to get my best runs either on Tuesday or Thursday.  I forgot my watch on my 3.3 mile loop but I am pretty sure I ran a fast 11 min/mile.    I wore my new water belt (got it at Christmas, but never used it).  Its a slim yellow water bottle that goes around your waist.  I have been afraid to try it out for fear of bouncing and jiggling, but once I got it tight enough it was fine.  In fact it was really comfortable for my short run.  I plan on using it for my longer runs, hopefully it will be just as comfortable.  I am not sure the brand, but for those who would like to know, I will find out by next post.

          After my last 30 min run (which felt pointless) I went for a 4.7 mile run.&nbsp; It was our old route with 2 hills and a muster of a hill (the second toughest hill I have ever ran).&nbsp; I wanted to take things slow however, I let my body glide me through the run.&nbsp; If it wanted to go slow I would.&nbsp; I didn't' have my watch with me so I didn't' time it, but it felt like a nice pace.&nbsp; I kept up with my brother (usually 9:30 pace) so either he slowed down for me or kept that pace.&nbsp; Either way that run was the best run in a long time.&nbsp; I have a longer run this Saturday with my group.&nbsp; It should be another good run!   good luck with your weekend race or training run.

            30 min.&nbsp;is almost not enough anymore.&nbsp; When I am running its a little tiring but nothing like one I first started.&nbsp; Now after my shower I feel like I didn't' run enough.&nbsp; Its as if I haven't ran today or I forgot I already ran.&nbsp; I was driving to lunch and I noticed this guy running down the street and I thought out loud, "hey I need to do my run," then I remembered I already did it.&nbsp; Maybe I will do another 3 later tonight after dinner, considering I have a rest day tomorrow.&nbsp; The problem with running twice in a day is the fact that I don't' have enough running clothes.&nbsp; I don't' mind putting dry, dirty ones on since they will be gross anyway but the sweaty wet ones I do only because when&nbsp;I am&nbsp;running I don't realize how sweaty my clothes get until I get home.&nbsp; I think I just might wait till tomorrow evening to run again.&nbsp; Who knows.&nbsp; I am getting ancy and rambling so I must be going.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      My brother and I ran for 30 min on dirt.&nbsp; It was hard for the first 15 min dodging pebbles and rocks.&nbsp; every once in a while you someone would yell out, "Ouch", or "Uh-oh."&nbsp; But we made it safely to our turn around spot.&nbsp; The way back to our car was a much easier than the way up.&nbsp; It was a nice change than cement (I know, I know cement is bad :)).&nbsp; I am not sure how often I am going to run that trail but I am anxious to try more hiking trails.&nbsp; fells good on the feet!  &nbsp;  Don't Quite Damn It!!!!  &nbsp;  Enjoy your runs.

          I haven't post my last Tuesday night run.&nbsp; I have been pretty busy.&nbsp; My brother's (non running one) wife just gave birth to a little girl.&nbsp; She is the third beautiful baby in the world.&nbsp; They named her Peyton Ryan.&nbsp; Now that the birth is over I can go run tonight to make sure I get my 4 run week in.   Tuesday's run.&nbsp; I decided to take off from my house instead of driving somewhere.&nbsp; I mapped out a few routes the night before using my mom's tripodometer (every car NEEDS one).&nbsp; I ran a 5.0 mile&nbsp;route with a few hills.&nbsp; I didn't bring water and it was HOT out.&nbsp; I didn't wait till the evening like I usually do in the summer.&nbsp; Luckily I put a 20.00 dollar bill in my key holder and remembered as I past by a 7-11 store.&nbsp; I was dying in the heat by the time I got half way.&nbsp; I trudged on through and finished the run.&nbsp;   I learned my lesson to run either in the morning or in the evening.&nbsp; I seem to be able to run further and better when its not so hot.   See it, Feel it, Trust it!

      My blog is acting really strange.&nbsp; Sorry for all the confusion hopefully&nbsp;I will figure out what's wrong and fix it back to normal.&nbsp;   I finished my 6 mile run in a minute longer than expected, I came in at 107:43.&nbsp; Tracy and I ran together and we were talking about life&nbsp;and how he acted in high school.&nbsp; He is quite a bit older than me, I came to the conclusion that the 70's were a groovy decade.&nbsp; I would have liked to have a Volkswagen van when I was in High school, heck even now would be neat.&nbsp;   As Tracy and I were running a young lady joined up with us.&nbsp; Her name is Helen and she ran/walked LA's marathon last year.&nbsp; She ran with us till the end and later said you guys are to fast for me, I will stick with you up till mile 10 then after that I will find a pace group that runs/walks.&nbsp; I hope she will continue to run with us.&nbsp; She is an interesting lady.   Next Saturday we have an 8 mile run and Tracy won't be there, in fact he won't be there for 2 weeks.&nbsp; I am hoping to finish in a 11 minute mile and find people who are entertaining.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sure that won't be a problem.&nbsp; I am looking forward to the challenge.   Have a great week.&nbsp; Run hard or go home!&nbsp;

      8.0 miles is really not  that  bad of a running distance. Last night I went out around 915pm with my brother and we had one of our "therapy" sessions. Its been a while since we have been able to talk about life and its mysteries. We ran up hill for 3.5 miles turned around and ran back. Even though the first half was  all up  hill, it wasn't nearly as bad as I had first imagined. Then we ran around my complex its about 1 mile around. It took us 1:23 to finish the run. Faster than I did the 8 on Saturday with my group. I wonder if it was because I was talking and enjoying the run or if it was because half of it was downhill. I like to think it was both!  I saw a license plate frame and I don't' really understands what it meant. I was wondering if you would know. The top part of the frame read "runners only" the bottom of the frame read "miserable". I took a double glance to make sure I read it right and I did. I don't' get it. Anyway I am going to do an easy 3 tonight to keep my legs from tightening up.  Have a great run

      I have a sort of running related question. As you all probably know by now I am getting up to higher mileage on Saturday I ran 9.0 miles and it increases each week. Ever since I started this running program and following it pretty regularly, I have not had an appetite. I don't like forcing something down just because I haven't eaten. When I do eat its usually a quesadillia and some milk. I stopped eating red meat about 2 years ago, and I have chicken on an occasional basis. I do eat pasta for dinner when I get hungry. I also drink water.  I use to be full of energy and always willing to do anything at anytime. But since this training I find myself sleeping all day on the weekends and when I do wake up in the day I am ready to go back for another nap. I have taken 2 naps today and I am exhausted. During the week I am tired and I don't' get the luxury of taking a nap. I know its not because of depression because I was diagnosed a year ago and have been on medication ever since. I guess my question is, could I be exhausted because I am over training....(I run maybe 2-4 times a week, about 3-6 miles during the week and my long run on Saturday's) or is it because of my diet. If its my diet how can I eat when I am not hungry.
