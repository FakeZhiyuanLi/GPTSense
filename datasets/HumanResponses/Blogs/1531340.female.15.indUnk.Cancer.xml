      I AM SO PISSED!!!  My parents are running around being all pissed off at me about the stupid transportation system I have to figure out for the stupid summer school thing.  Picky picky dorks.  Stephanie's mom offers to let us go to her house, and what do my parents do?  YELL AT ME AND TELLING ME THAT IT'S TOO FAR TO WALK.  HELLLLLLL-O!!!!  WHO'S DOING THE WALKING?  NOT YOU!  DO YOU HAVE ANY BETTER IDEAS?!?  OMG, I AM SO PISSED.  I WOULD CONTINUE TO RANT, BUT I'M AFRAID OF EXPLODING.  Beware, the imminent explosion of Mt. Jessica is drawing ever closer....

      Lalala, Elfie wanted Platypus to bloggie so Platypusie will do so...haha, Platypus in good mood!  Lalala, in first period everyone was running around everywhere...haha, I looked so informal today. But that was nothing compared to what Andrew Chen was wearing.  He was wearing jeans, crappy shoes, and a discolored shirt.  I was wearing dress pants and an unbaggy shirt.  *big improvement*  I even remembered to bring Mrs. Mekenian's pencil that I borrowed for the Disneyland trip.  Haha, so me, Elfie, Chicken, Monkey, and Mini Minnie Driver are walking around then Ms. Girkin comes and goes, "Genius."  So I turn around and follow her (not before dragging all of my little group with me) to Mekenian's class.  And then there's Mrs. Mekenian standing right there wtih a little baggie for me.  Then Chicken couldn't keep it in any longer and was like, "It's a Derek Fisher jersey!"  Yeah, it took me forever to find the dang thing, there was so much wrapping paper.  OMG, the stuffing tissue taught you how to draw Bugs Bunny!  Then I gave Mrs. Mekenian a hug.  Wait, I think she's the one who hugged ME.  Yeah.  I don't think I hugged anyone...x)  Man, everyone was crying today...stupid Vonne took our class's tissue...it was reserved for the Class of 2003...she's the class of 2004.  Haha....  I saw Elfie's parents driving her home!  Yeah, they were LATE!  Geez...it was 2:50!  *gasp*  SO LATE!  (that WAS sarcastic, by the way, numbskulls)

         WARNING.  STRONG LANGUAGE YET AGAIN.     I tend to blog when I'm pissed off, so what better time [or mood] than now?  Let's see.  I'm being forced (at rant time) to wear the ugliest skirt on the planet, coupled with the ugliest shirt and the ugliest pair of shoes.  Let me elaborate on this-- the skirt looks like one of those fucking 70's skirts.  You know.. the idiotic poodle skirts?  Only mine ain't felt, it ain't pink, and it ain't got no fucking poodle.  But besides that, it's a goddamn poodle skirt.  Fuck poodle skirts.  And the shirt?  It's fucking SEE THROUGH.    Expect a full rant in here tomorrow what with the promotion shit coming up.  Fuck.. I hate this.    And I had to go shoe shopping today.  If there's anything I hate more than wearing poodle skirts, it's SHOE SHOPPING.  FUCK SHOES.  FUCK SHOPPING.   FUCK IT ALL.  BUT THERE'S ONE FUCKING THING GOOD.    THE NETS WON!  GO NETS!

         WARNING.  STRONG LANGUAGE.     Don't you love my eloquent beginning to this?  It's only this post that has questionable language, don't worry.  I'm more pissed off than I ever was ever before this entire fucking week and what just happened isn't making it any better.  So if you happen to be against people who cuss and against people who enjoy venting their anger out at others, back off.  Right now.  So why don't I just start with this morning?  To put it more bluntly, promotion practice?  If that wasn't the gayest thing I've ever done in my entire life, I don't know what is, because that was the most wasted couple of hours that I ever spent.  If I have to endure another fucking hour of sexual harrassment I will punch him in the face.  In fact, I nearly did today, but the fucking presence of a fucking teacher stopped me.   As I said before, you should seriously considering backing off if you haven't already.  The top part wasn't vulgar.  This one will be.  Really.  So I'm sitting next to this fucking bitch.. who's now deciding to interrogate all the fucking people around him asking if they have thongs.  And once he asks me this I just stare at him and ask him why he fucking thinks I would have a fucking thong.  His reponse is so absolutely and completely retarded that I nearly slap him in the face.  I just glared at him and looked away.  And then inside..   I won't even write what he fucking did because it might just blind you.  On second thought, do I really give a damn what you think?  No, I don't.  But I won't, for the sake of all the little children who decided to enter my blog.  Of course, that fucking warning should have warned you.  I swear I will print this out and show it to Ms. Bitch, who's currently ranting about being depressed.  Depressed my ass.. she's been laying on her fucking behind all week, doing nothing but enjoying her fucking self and buying skirts that would fucking look like trash on any fucking person unlucky enough to wear the fucking thing.  Oh yeah, and third period was a fucking math test.  It's the fucking third to last day of school.  Fuck you, Gus.  And then we have to watch the fucking gayest Disney movie ever made in history class.  With fucking Brer Rabbit and Uncle Remus, in other words, the fucking basis for that fucking Splash Mountain ride at Disneyland that took us so fucking long to get on.  And now every fucking eighth grader is at the fucking "dance" having the goddamned time of their lives while I'm fucking stuck here in a house filled with lunatics that ain't worth shitting on.

       Mini @ 3:30 or so:   All right.  So I'm staring at Platypus' post and I've been blinded... MY little Spurs?  The Spurs can go to hell for all I care!  And no, I'm not in a good mood.  Did it honestly take you that long to notice?  Are you honestly that deluded?  Are you?  Piss me off.     Mini @ 3:35, after screwing up the blog template:  My aunt came back from New York today, bringing what has to be the ugliest skirt on the planet along with easily the ugliest blouse.  She made me wear it, and I swear I look like I'm from the 60's or something.  And then she tells me that it's pretty and I should wear it to promotion.  Hel-LO?!  I may be completely against this whole promoting morons thing but wear a dress that looks like that?!!!!!!!!!  Actually, stop at dress.  Wear a DRESS?!!!!  I got so pissed I yelled at my mom and she insisted that I wear it.  So I suffocated myself under the blankie and yelled at both of them to get outta my room, close the door, and back off. And my mom just said, "Fine, we'll go."   And then I yelled back, "YOU DO THAT."  So now she just threw a bowl of fruit at me and I swear she poisoned it, so I'm eating it so I don't have to go to promotion.    And then my frickin' internet isn't opening my web page correctly, even after I checked the entire damn thing for JavaScript and CSS errors.  I am so mad right now, it's not even funny.  -_-"  Oh, and by the way, Platypus... your beloved Nets lost on Sunday.  You should know that... tsk tsk.  You know what?  I plan to be ornery today.  GO SPURS.  KICK THE NET'S ASSES! NYYEHHH...   I'M GONNA DROWN MYSELF IN MY DVD NOW.  PAH.  COOKIE MONSTER IS NOW A COMPLETE MONSTER.   If you want good news, go find my frickin' mom and aunt.  They'll gush over how pretty the goddamn outfit is.  Bullshit.

And then Gus had to go ruin it all by telling me that whoever my  math teacher  was, he was an idiot for giving me award.  Gee thanks, Gus, I never knew you were capable of insulting two people at once-- me and you.   Ah, well. Geoffrey being nervous was a classic.  I will never ever forget him pawing the ground like.. a nervous colt.  Where did I get that cliché? ... ... ...   I read too much...    AND I STILL NEED MY GLASSES.  GIMME 'EM.  Update on "him" (so my mom doesn't get  suspicious ):  She ain't 'apposed ta like him.  *fume*  AND RANDY, GO "BEFRIEND" NELSON.  YOU KNOW YOU LIKE HIM.  JEEZ.

Just to piss Randy off.. how about... FLUFFY IS UGLY.  There...  Now what? There's a little bugger here at my house.  He's like.. seven and he stole my TV!  *fumefume* 'Twas all good later on cuz me and him wanted to watch the same show...  >.   UPSHUT, Randy, no one asked you for your opinion. Anyway.  Did anyone see my glasses?  *coughjessicacough*  I can't find my glasses!  *chokejessicachoke*  I NEED MY GLASSES!!!!  OOH... guess what?    Yeah, chicken butt's the right answer.    Okay.  Yeah...  *awkward silence*  OH!  I changed my mom's XP account to limited.  BWAHHAHAHAHA... and just so she can't get onto me daddy's account and make herself admin and me limited, I'm making him limited too.  ELFIE HAS THE POWER!   BWAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Right.  Okay.  I started a new fanfiction... and abandoned that last one.  The new one's actually a continuation of the last one so if you read that one, you're well off.  ^_^  I'm not  done  yet, go away.  Yay.  no more yaoi.

      I love you, Kaiba.  *shnuggle*  No, not really.  Not in a good mood.  Some frickin' moron wrote a yaoi fic and didn't label it in large letters again.  This time, I was warned.  Ha!  The second I saw the word "blush,"  I closed the browser.  Thank God.  Because when I went back to that site (it was a individually run fansite) I see this tiny itty bitty 4 point lettering say "Caution: Serious Yaoi".    PRAISE THE LORD.  Ah, well.  Let's see... Photoshop's being wonderful.  It's loading five times as fast on XP then on 98, which is really making me very happy.  I have yet to get used to XP's layout but I will... someday.  Soon, I hope.   I wonder if Blogger will let me put a whole mess of HTML markup in a post.  Hmmmmmmm........  Oh well.  I already messed up the layout anyway.  Which reminds me.  I must go fix it to correspond with some changes I made in my site.     Edit : Oi.  Now I'm in a  really  pissed off mood.  My frickin' mom was looking at the bloggy thing *because she used my comp*  EXCUSE MOI... but this is MY comp.. there's a frickin' reason why I have this password protected.  Hel-lo?!  I am  so  changing her account to limited access...  And she was like all suspicious going "Who's Kaiba?"  *see first line of blog*  And I just stared at her going "WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?"  And she wants proof that he's not a real person... so I had to frickin' show her all my kaiba pics (she was freaked out by the green haired one.. MWAHAHHAHAH) AND I had to go on to that lame KidsWB YGO site and show her that Seto Kaiba's an anime character.  There's a downside to being a Kaiba fan... maybe I should start putting "I love the Dark Magician" all over the frickin' place and then my mom can shut her yapping hole up for all I care... or maybe "I luv Kuriboh..."  or even more tragic "I LOVE THE MILLENNIUM ROD."  Oi.  That sounded ... weeird..  >_  PISS ME OFF.

"idio syncratic" is a very idiosyncratic person.. and she likes to cuss... like ... a lot.  SOOOOOOOO ON WITH MY STORY.  I was reading Yu-Gi-Oh fanfics and some moron didn't decide to write that it was a frickin' SLASH thing... and I just like.. went blind for five minutes...   AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I NEVER EVER EVER EVER AM READING A FAN FICTION AGAIN!  EVER! UNLESS IT'S ONE THAT I WRITE, IN WHICH CASE IT WOULD BE COMPLETELY APPROPRIATE FOR FIVE YEAR OLDS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY PROBABLY WON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT THE HECK I'M WRITING!   BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *SOB*  I NEVER EVER EVER... *dies*    I'm like... dying right now... I'm gonna have a NIGHTMARE.. preferably Tim Duncan will drown, but the person who wrote that fanfic is FIRST ON THE LIST!!! DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE  *sobs*  Nooooooo....

      You know, this really really sucks...Elfie's in LA being one of them little brightie kids and showing up her other little friends, while Platypus is stuck at home trying to pass the stupid time until something of real stature happens....hopefully sometime soon.  Seriously, I've lost track of what day it is aready....it's been too dang long.  I sat through 3 hours of news yesterday...apparently, Bush doesn't give crap squat for the Davis recall election whatsoever....he said something like, "It does not matter what I think.  It matters what the people of California think.  They have chosen to vote upon the recall of Governor Davis, and now they will have to decide who they would like to take over."  Yeah, and then I was like, "WOW!  SO ENLIGHTENING.....don't waste your breath, dumbass...."  ELFIE YOU HAVE TO COME BACK!!!!!

      Um.. yes...  well Platypus made me post here and so I think I'm back to blogger *fake happiness* But I  liked  Diaryland... BAH!  You know what?  I'll post in BOTH!  Yesh... >>;;;  Okay, that was odd.  Oddness!   I love odd.  Ooh!  Have you ever seen baby Priest Seto?  He's incredibly adorable.  He's all chubby, short, and cute, and so unlike what he grows up to be (which would be skinny, tall, and  hot ).  By the way, I'm not a fangirl.  Umm... let's see... attack Platypus.  Why does  she  get fast Internet access?  I'm stuck with cable, which normally would be decent.  On the contrary, it's not.  You want to know why?  Because the company is  Adelphia .  Yes, Adelphia.  The same company who told me to log onto their website and download a support package WHEN THE CABLE MODEM WAS NOT WORKING.    Right.  So, anyhow, I'm working on the first layout (I say it's the first, but it's actually the fifth) of my YuGiOh site, and it's only taking a very long time because I'm writing episode summaries.  Have you any idea how long those take? Lovely.   I want.. a shrubbery!  Damn those Monty Python fans...   RANDOM THOUGHT:  If Arnold Schwarzenegger wins for governor, I hope they misspell his name in the records.

      Elfie's weird.....but you know, I'd rather be stuck at home than where I am right now......the only good thing is that Daddy's office has got *gaspshockfaintdierevive* T-1!  It's faster than DSL and cable combined....but crap, 'tis expensive stuffs...i think 'tis over 100 bucks per month.  I COULD LIVE ON MCDONALD'S FOR LESS THAN 100 BUCKS PER MONTH...

      This is bullhickey.  I reckon I should start on my homework sometime soon.  I'm hoping to sleep before 10 tonight.  Ha, I doubt it.  Period 0: Biology H - This is stupid.  I have to transfer like 50 labs into my damn notebook.  Piece of sh*t.  Period 1: English 1 H - Haha, I'm always the last one in the class because almost nobody in my class has got a zero, so they're there real early.  I only gots 6 minutes to get to classie wassie.  I swear, Cook must think she runs the class now or something.  SO MUCH STUFFS TO DO!  Period 2 - Ceramics: What fun.  A box.  With a face.  A sun face.  Joy.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H - Don't worry Elfie, I've got a B-, too.  But it's Honors, so it counts as an A.    Period 4 - I didn't have to go today!  Yay!  That means I get to pantomime brushing my teeth AND being a cow tomorrow.  *big grin*  Period 5 - World History H - We have to make stupid storybooks for little third graders.  The teach's wife teaches little third graders in Claremont.  Apparently, about 25% of the kids are the kids of Claremont college professors.  I was like, "WOW!  ASK THEM TO RECOMMEND ME!"  Haha.  Oh yes, by the way, we're supposed to explain.........the FRENCH REVOLUTION.  HELL, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW FRANCE EXISTED UNTIL LAST YEAR....  Period 6 - Golf/Basketball - I don't even know why I'm putting basketball, I'm not doing it yet.  Haha, stupid Baucher had Tiff's name on the list for playing today in the match.  Then he comes up to me and tells me that I'M playing.  I'm like, "What the hell?"  Haha, I did horribly.  Don't ask for my score.  I can't tell you.  If I did, I'd have to kill you.

Enter me in fangirldom.  *smirk*   Geometry :  My life freaking SUCKS.  I have a B- in GEOMETRY.   GEOMETRY!   Yes, this is me talking.  A freaking  B- .  Bloody.  I also sit in the waaaay back of the class and so the teacher never looks at me, right? WRONG!  And whenever she sees me, she sees me doing something I'm not supposed to!  Like, reading manga instead of taking notes!  Or doing HOMEWORK in class!  Oh.. what a BIG crime.   English:   I have a BBBBBBBBBBBBB!!!!  AAAHHHH!! My life is over, seriously.  And Caitlin, stop it.  OR ELSE.. I WILL.. dunno.   NWC:   I totally failed the Africa test.  Where the bleep is Somalia?  I couldn't freaking find Somalia on the map!  (okay, so I couldn't find Malawi, Guinea, and Kenya either, but that's besides the point.)    Programming:   *beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep*   PE:   We played "tennis."  Bull.  We actually spent about 35 minutes stretching, 5 minutes whacking the ball at each other, and the rest of the time in the locker room.   Latin:   (aka the only class I'm passing x.x)  It was boring...  Dude.  I don't give SHIT about Pompeii.  And you know what?  The fact that iuvenes means "young men" means NOTHING to me.  I don't CARE about Latin!   Biology:   I'm getting a B+!!!  It's my second highest grade!  In  BIO!  I don't even LIKE bio!  Meeehhhh

      Pooga.  What fun.  I love it when Mr. Manessero runs practice.  There were too many people waiting to tee off so we ditched the first three holes and went to the third.  We doned at 4:30!  Biology H - Yay.  We classified bugs today.  What fun.  Except everyone had moth balls in their box, along with their decayed bugs, so as anyone with even half a mind  , THE CLASS SMELLED LIKE SHIT.  And IT WAS 7 IN THE MORNING.  English 1 H - Lovely quiz.  Holy shit.  Lovely Cook stuck all the vocab on the board when we got into the classroom, so everyone pulled out their little study sheets and studied....stupid.  Ceramics - Poo.  I'm allergic to like that damn clay when it dry.  Algebra 2 H - Weird.  Nicholson wanted to have all the people in our class who could drive to do an experiment about trend lines.  Lovely.  Drama - Yay.  Guess what I get to do?  I get to pantamime brushing my teeth.  Dammit.  World History H - Watched a movie about um.....a Struggle For Democracy.  Ask me if I give a hoot.  Golf/Basketball - Ouch.  Me sorie.

      Bloody shit.  Today was so fucking annoying it wasn't even freaking funny.  And my stupid dad is smoking again.  If I get lung cancer, pin the tail on that motherfucking donkey.  Listening to:   My Will, Other Side of the Moon, Love of My Life, Double Dear, Kiseki no Hana   Geometry H  -  BULLSHIT.  Who gives the freaking SHIT about angles?  Hell, I did when I was in.. second grade, but PLEASE, this is HIGH SCHOOL, not ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.  Give me a damned BREAK!   English 1 H  - I swear, Caitlin, if you bop me on the head one more time with that ugly ass pen, I WILL stop acting like a wounded puppy and more like  you're  Takatori and I'm Ran.  So..fucking..STOP...it.   Geography/NWC  - Three words-  SCREW YOU, FARR.   Programming  - Bloody.  Okay, if I EVER EVER EVER get my hands on that dumbass teacher, I WILL kill him.  I hate the class, hate the people (most of them anyway), and fucking DETEST the teacher.   PE  - It was gay, but bearable.  I can't play tennis.   Latin  - Facking GAY as all hell!  I read "canem" as "cenam", so I put "gustat" instead of "vocat" and so missed that stupid retarded question I would have gotten right otherwise.  And I was SO DAMN CLOSE to a perfect score!  *kicks*   Biology  - Bunch of fundraising crap.  Like I want to raise money for some gayass shit so we can go dissect things.

      Nonono.  POW stands for Problem Of the Week.  But yes, I do feel like a damn prisoner of war about that shitake.  Oii.  We went and played a par 3 today.  'Twas quite fun.  Too bad I screwed up every other time.  Ha.  Biology H - Pinned my buggos today.  It was....um...interesting, for lack of a better word.  My mothie's head FELL OFF.  For crying out loud, that hella annoyed me half to death.  Man, I was ticked off.  I still gots to kill about three buggies.  Dammit, that doesn't sound nice at all.  Not nice.  Period.  Oii.  That's pissing me off, too.  Gots to write up a labbie...gots to tell how you can tell what kind of material that shit is made of.  Here's a way: blackmail it outta your teach.  That's what I be doing.  Yay! And as far as me and Chicken can tell, I've got the highest grade so far.  English 1 H - What fun.  So far, we've had 4 subs in the same week.  Except we had Mrs. Cook, and she just about assigned all that she possibly could.  Mr. John Eckman was like, "Can a sub actually assign that much crap to do?"  Yay.  We have a comprehensive test from Chapters 1 through 15, and a vocab test from 9 through 15.  TOO BAD WE NEVER GOT THE DAMNED VOCAB WORDS FOR CHAPTERS 9 THROUGH 11, AIN'T IT?!?  Ceramics - My god, the upperclassmen I sit next to are so......so.....imaginative.  Oh yes.  That's what it is.  Oh my facking GOD.  Algebra 2 H - My god.  I have a B.  *snifflesobcrydierevive*  Drama - What fun.  Gots to write a review.  World History H - It's actually OK, I've got like one of the highest grade in the class.  Wow, they must be stupid.  Actually, it ain't as bad as I thought it was going to be.  It's actually not the boringest class I have.  *surprise*  Golf/Basketball - The only good thing about this is that I get off early on Fridays.  Yay!

      Dude.  I'm in a freaking sucky mood.  Is there no bloody site on the entire Internet that has decent  Weiss Kreuz  or  YuGiOh  sheet music?  It freaking SUCKS that there isn't, because that would put me in a really really good mood.  Ha.  Never gonna happen now, though.  Platypus, what the beep is POW?  Prisoner of War?  You're learning about freaking prisoners of war in Algebra 2?  What the heck is your teacher, a war enthusiast?  Why am I so facking unhappy?  I'm too freaking lazy to make a template for this blog, which is why is still looks like royal shit right now, but I'll do it someday.  Hah.  Yeah.  Suuuure, Charlotte, you said that last time.  Penguins.  And Yuuto just scared the living shit out of some poor guy who wanted to call his son "Kamui."  Stupid Yuuto.  Stupid.. freaking.. pedophiles.  Yuuto's what.. 35?  And he's like.. dating Satsuki.. who's.. what, 14?  Pedophiles.  *coughSeishirouFuumaYuutocough*  Listening to various music sung by random voice actors.  And for penguin's sake, Midorikawa Hikaru's a wonderful seiyuu, but he can't sing for shit.  If you want proof, listen to "Spiritualized."  Yes, that's Midorikawa.  No, it's not a suffocating cat.  See?  I told you he can't sing.  I have a whole shitload of homework I have to do.  Let's list it, just so you can see what this ickle freshman has to do, okay?  Okay.    Geometry - pp. (something I forgot.. yeah, that helps) 1-41 Read first chapter of  Of Mice and Men  Double Journal [Copy & analyze quote] Literature Log -  The Grapes of Wrath  Read "How to Mark a Book" "The End of Apartheid" worksheet Finish "Cry Freedom" movie guide Biology Chapter 4 study guide questions Study for a Latin test 5 Lessons - CM Level IX music theory  YEAH.

      Yay!  What fun.  We played Mark Keppel today.  My god, their golf team is so good you don't even know.  Holy shitake!  One of the girls shot a 35 and one shot a 34.  The lowest score in our group was a 48!  Their highest score was a 45!  OMFG.  I don't even believe this.  Apparently, they're ranked third in all of Southern California.  That's scary.  I can't imagine anyone playing better than they do...and I was with their worst player.  OMFG.  Bio H - what fun.  Dimensional analysis test tomorrow, lab is due.  Load of bull dung.  English 1H - Yay!  Tomorrow's teacher will be the sub's sub's sub's sub.  What fun.  Ceramics - Eh...............  Algebra 2H - POW's!  Test tomorrow.  I have a B in the class. I'm going to cry.  That means that in order for me to get an A on the progress report, I have to ace my next two tests and quizzes.....................  Drama - What fun.  We did entrances today!  Yay.  I burst through the door and almost died...  World History H - Yay!  I was a peasant again....when we read our stupid proposal to solve France's economical problems, that son of a bitch bastard who thinks he's all cool just because he plays the king was like, "Treason!  Off with their heads."  So then I was like, "Hell yeah, you do that.  Who the mother f*** are you going to get to make FOOD in your country?  Will it be you, you little dumbass?  All you know how to do is sit on you goddamn throne and be a fucking jackass!"  Omg, NOW I'M PISSED.    Golf - I just told you about it.  At the beginning, remember?  Oh, wtf, nevermind.  Yay!  Off early tomorrow.  Go home and sleepieful.  Actually, no.  I go to Mesa and flaunt the fact that I'M allowed on campus and THEY'RE not.  Screw Troy.  They're off tomorrow.

I think my teacher's going to be killed by a random person in my class some day, she's SO annoying.  Feh.    Period 1 - Caitlin was gone today, so Jim/James was whacking me on the head with HIS pen.  Bloody bastard.  xP  Okay, I don't really mind it that much.  It's just that he scared the shit out of me when he said he was channeling Caitlin's spirit.  THAT was scary.  Ah well.  Two tests in one period--this period.  Lovely, ne?  Period 2 - eehhhmmm... Cookies!  O.o  We had to listen to election speeches.. 'twas BORING...  Period 3 - Boring as usual... wrote a few programs, pissed a few people, all part of the cycle.  Next?  Period 4 - OMG... PE.. Screw.  It was so gay.. I spent the entire time reading X2..

      Oh ho, at least my school doesn't have idiots in it just because they admitted people of far below average IQ in.  My school is just a nice school that accepts idiots without testing them.  Not that you're an idiot, Elfie, I'm meaning other idiots. *coughERICAcoughGUNNcough*  And by the way, I don't have to be in plays...I CAN BE STAGE CREW!  Hell yeah.  Engineering was my second choice for a major...  Period 0 - Yay!  Triple-beam balances.  Graduated cylinder.  What fun.  Period 1 - Dammit, I'm starting to love this class.  Today, we had Mrs. Cook.  She's the sub's sub's sub.  In other words, she's the sub for the sub for the sub.  We haven't done ANYTHING ALL WEEK.  My god, it's been fun.   Period 2 - Ceramics...some idiot forgot to put a needle tool back.  WE HAD TO WRITE VOCAB WORDS AND TAKE A TEST.  I'd recite them to you, I still know the definitions, but my World History homework awaits, since Troy genius didn't gimme a straight answer.  Period 3 - Algebra 2...I'm going to fail that damn class.  POW's!    Period 4 - Drama....the teach is actually ok...blah  Period 5 - Yay!  We did that role play shit that we did in 7th with Lee....I WAS A PEASANT!  Period 6 - Golf/Basketball.  no golf today...matchie tomorrow.  Basketball don't start until I finish golf. God damn.  I'm the only one allowed on campus at Mesa before school is out!  Yay!  All you Troy people who want to go, FORGET IT.  Yay!

      All right, then, but we all know which school's better, ne?  At least I don't take DRAMA.  And I don't have to be in PLAYS, unlike a certain PERSON I know.. *COUGH*  FEH.  Oiiii.... someone asked me to homecoming... o____________________________O  *goes and hides in a corner*  MUMMIE...  So.. school today.  Period 0 - BLOODY.  We had to take a test today, and even though it's geometry and I've learned it before, I FAILED.  I know it!  I can't memorize theorems and postulates for shit.  And she put some really strange crap on the test.  Period 1 - It was okay.  I'm not voting for Caitlin because she keeps bopping me on the head with her dratted fluffy pen, but aside from that, it was pretty good.  And Jim/James or whatever his name is... FEH.  Must you call Weiss German Rice?  Period 2 - OMG.. I HATE this class.. but then you already knew that.  We just watched Denzel Washington get beaten to death.  'Twasn't interesting, I don't recommend it.  It didn't make me want to cry.  Now watching Kuroneko-sama get beat to death would make me cry.  Poor kitty.  Period 3 - *fuuuuuuuuume*  Period 4 - 'Twas gay.  It was picture day today, and we had to go take pictures during PE.  It was a frigging waste of time.  Period 5 - LATIN.  BAh.  It was SO very boring...  Period 6 - BIO.  OH MY GOD.. I FAILED THE TEST I SWEAR I FAILED IT...  *runs away sobbing*

      Hello.  I am not a hypocritiieeeeeeeeeeeee.  See? I blogging.  Ha.  I gets to rant about shit here, TOO.  NOT JUST YOU.  I'M SPECIAL, TOO.  I be just likie you and rantie about MY school.  Period 0 - Bio first thing in the morning.  What's worse, I sit in the front row.  The teacher thinks he's funny and constantly breaks out in songs.  OH MY GOD.  Yay!  Classification of insects!  And we had a conversion test.  HALF THE GODDAMN TEST WAS NEW MATERIAL THAT HE DIDN'T EVEN TEACH US,  THE IDIOT.    Period 1 - The teach ain't even her half the goddamn time.  'Pparently, he ain't be here no more to teachie no more.  But 'tis okay, his class easy as hellful.  Period 2 - Ceramics.  Oh my god.  The teachieful is funny as hell though.  The upperclassmen sitting next to me were have a convo about a "big-ass party" and then the teacher comes over and was like, " how stupid.  Think about it.  A Big-Ass party?  I'm sorry, you don't qualify, you can't come in."  Funniful.  Period 3 - The only female teach I gots-Nicholson.  Oi.  Don't likie her classie.  Period 4 - My god, the disgrace.  DRAMA.  I don't even wanna talk about it.  Period 5 - World History.  My god.  But the teach is the coach for mock trial, so we does lots of debates.  Period 6 - Golfie and Basketball.....so very very tiring.    If you haven't noticed, I ain't in a bloggie mood right now.

      Platypus is such a hypocrite.  -_- Telling ME to blog when SHE doesn't do it herself.  Puuuuuh- leeze ...  Well, I at least have somewhere to rant about today.  If you're not in a mood to listen to me talk, I suggest you back away.  First, let me introduce myself.  I'm a freshman.  An itty-bitty freshman.  I'm not telling you where I'm from, though, sorry.  I manage a website ( urlLink here ) and I love HTML, CSS, JS, and all that good stuff.    Period 0 - Can geometry be any more boring?  For Chrissake, I learned all this crap when I was four and a half feet tall!  Wait.. I  am  four and a half feet tall... -_- Okay, four feet tall, then.  In any case, I learned it a while ago.  And I don't give SHIT about proofs.  Plus, my teacher is so boring it's not even funny.  They should get lively and animated teachers to teach in 0 period.  They  do  realize NOBODY is awake at that time, don't they..?   Period 1 - It was okay.  An etymologies quiz that I totally bombed, but apart from that and the fact that the moron sitting across the row from me keeps cutting himself to scare me, it was fine.  Oh yes.  Loads of homework though.   Period 2 - Holy crap I hate this class.  The teacher is a ditz, the people around me are morons, the subject is boring (who CARES about Africa?), and this so-called "IB" class is full of complete idiots.  All we did was freaking take notes.     Period 3 - GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH.  C++ is fun, but the teacher can GO TO HELL.  So can that guy sitting next to me.  Get your own brain, moron.  And learn to turn on a calculator; it's something I've personally known how to do since I was... really small.   Period 4 - I HATE PE.  HATE IT.  HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE IT.  HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATE it.  I don't WANT to run like a leprechaun!  For chrissake, I'M NOT IRISH!   Period 5 - Latin!  I hate Caecilius.. *kills him*  I think I failed the quiz... -_______________-   Period 6 - BBBIIIOOO.... *kills*

      WAHAHA.  The Mavs got killed last night.  You know it.  But it's OK.  I still love them.  For crying out loud, they were playing against the Lakers.  So it's OK.  That still puts them in second place in the Western Conference, seeing as how Tim Duncan is going to get assassinated sometime soon.........*brainstormglaresmirk*  The Kings are hopeless.  I mean, yes, they beat the Lakers, but shit, it was a preseason game.  The fact still remains that the Lakers will make Western Conference Finals at the very least,  and I'm willing to bet almost anything on them winning the championship this year.  Biology H:  Yay.  We listened to the big idiot talk.  By big, I mean HUGE.  He's about 5000 pounds.  It's sad.  English 1 H: Yay.  More grammar.  Am I the only one who thinks it's fun?  Ceramics:  Crap.  We lost tool.  Again.  Those idiots.  MORE WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS!  Tell me, what the hell isa  written assignment for in a ceramics class?  Aiyah.  Algebra 2 H:  WE ARE NOT GOING TO SOLVE THAT DAMN POW.  No, not the prisoner of war.  Just the POW.  Drama:  Horrible.  For my play, I have to act like my husband just cheated on me.  WHAT THE HELL........  World History:  POP QUIZ.  The idiots just didn't know how to shut the hell up.  But I think I aced it.  Take that, dammit.

Yah.  No, actually, Sheila wanted to go to Christian Club, but thankfully she got sidetracked and we ended up next to Lewis' class.   I just did homework.  And listened to Weiss, because ASB was blasting the Spice Girls and I can't STAND them.  Better than going to Christian Club.  Vanessa would faint.  Or at least think I was on crack or something.      --> Latin    class:  Death to derivative fun day.  'Least we didn't have that.  We did, however, go to the library and so I had to wait for 20 minutes for that stupid idiotic computer to start up.    -->  Biology    quote:   Rishi:  Oh, oh, so WHO won yesterday?

Me:  They were better off than the Lakers!  Plus Nowitzki couldn't play because of the dumbass Spurs.  So THERE. Rishi:  It was just ONE player! Me:  Yah.  I'd like to see the Lakers win the shitty championships WITHOUT Shaq or Kobe, seeing as they lost WITH them!    class:  It was a LAB.  Labs must DIE.  Because Caitlin was in my GROUP.  And the stuff we were playing with was PINK.  I hate PINK.  Pink will DIE.

I left my geometry book in Latin yesterday, so I kind of didn't have it when we were doing warmups from the book.  And I forgot my pencil box/bag/pouch thing at home.  Eaargh.

      Holy shit.  I cannot fucking move.  Dammit.  Holy shit.  Practice was hell yesterday.  Haha, I've used a cuss word in every previous sentence so far.  Not anymore.  Anyhoo, here's the damn skinny on the stupid practice that almost has us dead on our feet.  First of all, I slept over at Jody's house for her birthday on Staurday night.  So yesterday, we went to her mommy's alumni barbecue thing.  We filled up water balloons, and we began to throw them.  Shit, it was three on one.  Jody, Joanne, and Jaimie all tried to get me.  Shiite.  I took about 7 full-front hits.  I got Joanne back, though.  She was trying so hard not to get wet.  Haha.  After she got me, she ran behind the railing, and I chucked the damn balloon.  It exploded against the railing and soaked her back completely.  Holy shit.  Haha, she was like, "Oh hell, no.  You did not just do that."  Haha.  I got hit about fifty times.  I got Jody on the arm and Jaimie 'round the midriff.  Damn, by the time I got to practice, me and Jody were both soaked as hell.  Haha.  Then Stacey   was like, "There's too much ash in the air.  You guys don't have to run today.  Besides, it's the first practice back."  Everyone was scared as hell....she ALWAYS makes us run.  Anyhoo.  We did layups for about 50,000 hours.  Then we did shooting.  Then we played knockout.  Loser had to do "Executions."  Stacey would tell you waht to do.  Dammit.  I was runner-up all four damn times.  So we're playind everyone else is doing sit-ups.  So I lose, and then Stacey tells me, "Push-ups."  Shit.  I was like, "Why the hell is everyone else doing sit-ups?"  Haha.  Like it mattered.  We had to do "Stacey push-ups."  She'd say "down" and then we'd have to go down and STAY there until she said up.  Damn.  You should've seen it.  Everyone's arms were shaking.  Then we did sit-ups, same thing, except she said "up" instead.  Yeah.  It was weird.  When we were doing sit-ups, everyone was complaining that their abs hurt.  I dunno why, but everytime I did one, my stomach wouldn't hurt, but there would be a shooting pain in my forehead.  Then we did leg lifts.  So today we were all dead.   So anyhow, today:  Period 0 - Biology H: We gots out quizzes back.  90%!  Hell yeah!  I though I failed.  Period 1 - English 1 H: I forgot what we did.  Crap.  Oh yeah.  We graded shit.  Period 2 - Ceramics: Crap.  I'm going to fail this damn class.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Holy cow.  I'm actually getting better at that math.  Holy shit.  I'm actually getting them right.  AND I'm doing them faster than everyone else.  *gloat*  Period 4 - Drama:  Yay.  Laura and I spent the damn period talking about how we couldn't move.  Shit.  Period 5 - World History H: Yeah.  We took notes.  LOTS of them.  Crap.  Me hand died.  AND my arm was already dead.  Period 6 - Golf: HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.  The match was cancelllllllled.  'Twas supposed to be in Claremont *hinthinttoomuchsmokehinthint* *hinthintbigassfiretherehinthint*  Later: Yay.  Scrimmage for basketball.  OMFG.  I can't even fucking move.  It's OK.  Neither can Laura, nor can Jody.  Haha.  That's 60% of our team.  Shit.

And now I shall talk randomly.  Okey.  Anyhow, I hate Mondays because it's the first day of the school week and there are five (!!) days until weekend starts again.  Plus the quarter is over and so I have tests and projects coming up.  Which means that I'm screwed.  X_X  I'm also sick.  I lost my voice today.  Eargh.  I couldn't sleep yesterday.  When I finally did, I had this really strange dream.  *nod*  It had all these anime people in it.  O.o;;;  From exceedingly random anime series.  Like, reaaally random.

I got full scores on ALL my etymologies quizzes except for one (I got one wrong ^^)!  (!!!)  I never study.  Like, ever.  I'm really getting good at this.  Heh.  We also did presentations today.

Death to C++.  DEATH.  ^^      ---> PE    verbatim:   Coach Homer:  Okay.  Now, the weather is really nice outside, with ash everywhere and all, so we're going to sit out there and consume as much ash as possible!  Everyone knows that ash is good for you and so you all need to go out there and get your daily ash intake! Everyone:  ... HAAAAH, Homer, that's funny. Me: . . .   class:  Boredom.  Utter boredom.  We sat around the gym.  I just read  X  while listening to  Velvet Underworld .  'Twas very, very redundant.    ---> Latin    verbatim:   Eric:  Why do you have a fake flower?

'Twas a nice way to begin class, really.  -_-"  At least we didn't have to sing happy birthday in Latin.  We had to last week.  It was really, really weird.    ---> Biology    verbatim:   Mrs. Hall:  *babbleaboutATPandglycolysisforthirtyminutes* Mrs. Hall:  Got it? Everyone:  ... no.   class:  Argh!  I don't GET bio!

What Happened:   We watched a majorly shitty (and old)  WWI movie.  How old?  Well, the guy narrating had a lisp, and the sound technicians sucked so much the background music was louder than the damned narrator.  Plus they all had British accents.  British accents + lisp = nonintelligible conversation.     Period Two : Nonwestern Cultures IB     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  2.  What Happened:   Ugh.  This class was so terrible I was in maaaaajor genocidal mode by the end of it.  Those crapping idiots wouldn't freaking SHUT THEIR HOLES!  It was SO annoying.  I seriously wanted to kill half the people in my class.  I was throwing knives at their heads in my imagination.  I'm serious.  Dead serious.     Period Three : Fundamentals of Programming     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  7.  What Happened:  Crap.

      Today smelled worse than the guys in PE.  And my mom is being a royal pain in the ass.  I need someplace where I can rant and not be afraid of anyone getting mad at me.  In other words, I need a domain.  Badly.  But nooo.. if I get one, my dumbass mother is going to check it to see what I'm doing with the damn thing.  Maybe I should just write the thing in Latin, so she can't read it.   mood:   ticked  listening to:   The Real Folk Blues {Cowboy Bebop}     0.  Geometry.

What Happened:   All we freaking did was listen to Rasch drone on and on about proofs.  I don't give SHIT about them.  Now we have a damned quiz tomorrow, and I have to study.  I hate Geometry.  HATE it.  And yes, Zane was talking to me.  I did actually fall asleep.     1.  English.     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  7.  Quote:   Chris:  You have to be the old guy!

Me:  This is World War I, not Rap 101, you idiot.   What Happened:   English wasn't that bad.  We had short periods (except p.3) today, so I didn't have to pretend to be a soldier.  Which was good, because I would have randomly dropped dead at the wrong time.  So damned TIRED.     2.  Nonwestern Cultures.     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  4.  Quote:   Farr:  So because the Israelis were starting to be faced with cruelty charges, they stopped shooting the Palestinians and started breaking their arms instead.

ALL PERIOD.  About the Arab/Israel conflict.  You know, we've been doing these same notes since Monday.     Assembly.  Red Ribbon.    Damn, the band sucked.  They got a freaking band in here to perform screwed up anti-drug variations of 'popular songs.'  Ever heard 'Shake Ya Tailfeathers' warped into something that denounces drugs?  If not, thank your lucky stars.     3.  Fundamentals of Programming.     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  8.  Quote:   Kathy:  My files disappeared! Me:  What, did they self delete? Kathy: .....  they can do that?   What Happened:   Dude.  66 minutes of FoP.  And all we did was continue the test for the idiots who didn't finish it yesterday.  Well guess what?  I FINISHED IT YESTERDAY.  So I was hella bored the entire period.  I managed to finish geometry homework though.  That was a plus.  It's also the sole reason this stupid class gets a higher score than English did.     4.  PE.     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  5.  What Happened:  Tennis, tennis, tennis.  In scorching heat.  Not a good combination.  We played the same people we did yesterday.  Tennis rackets must die.     5.  Latin     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  3.

Dude, you're what's wrong with society.   What Happened:  We took a vocab quiz.  I swear I wasn't thinking.  Like, at all.  Look.  We had to write the Latin word "why."  I don't know WHAT the hell was going through my head, but instead of putting down 'cur' I wrote 'doushite.'  *bangs head on keyboard*  GAAAAAAAAH!  All this anime is going to my BRAIN!  @_@  The second I saw 'why' I thought 'doushite' instead of 'cur'!  AAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKK!     6.  Biology     On a scale of 1 to 10, this class was a  -2564522.  What Happened:  Ugh.  UGH.  Remember the test I took yesterday?  REMEMBER IT?  *fumes* Remember I said I FAILED?  Well, for the first damned time in my life,  I wasn't lying.  AT ALL.  Because I DID fail, even though she CURVED the damn test!  Seriously.  Out of a possible score of 64, yours truly somehow managed to screw it up and get a... *drumrollhighlighttoseedrumroll*   36 !  Aren't you PROUD of me?!    Kill me now.

      Yay.  Platypus is here.  Platypus is here.  Platypus finished Platypus' homework.  That is why Platypus is here.  No, Platypus is not finished with Platypus' homework.  Platypus is here because she's being nice to Elfie.  Platypus try to follow Elfie pattern, but it not be work.  Besides, Platypus not speak Latin.  You have be forewarnnnned.  No, Platypus decided Platypus not want to.  Platypus decide Platypus need to pee.  Platypus be right back.  Platypus back.  OK, Platypus' day went like thisie:  Period 0 - Biology H:  Yay.  Cell Lab.  Onion cells and Elodea leaves.  Dammit.  I wanted to eat the onion.  People looked at me like me crazyful.  I love onions.  So sue me.   &lt;Stupid shameless little edit by Elfie ~ We did Elodea leaves and onion cells two weeks ago!  -_-  I made Caitlin do everything.  Except look through the microscope.  Because I didn't trust her.  ^_^&gt;   Period 1 - English 1 H:  My God, Dahlberg, the replacement teach, just made himself a roomful of enemies.  I have the only A in the class, and it's not even a solid A.  Apparently, if you get a 4, it's only a 95% because getting 100% would mean that you have a perfect paper, and he said it's so damn near impossible to turn in a perfect paper that he didn't expect any.  At all.  So we were like, "So you're saying it's pretty much impossible to write a perfect paper."  The dolt's reply:  "I never said that."  We're all doomed.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  Haha.  My hands were dead after that damn period.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Haha, all the sophs and juniors (we have a few, I think) hold me in high regard now.  They think I'm this super-smart crazy-ass freshie.  My God, it gets kind of cool after a while.  Period 4 - Drama:  Shit, you will not believe how funny this class is.  Unless, of course, you cheat and enroll.  Period 5 - World History H:  There goes the highest grade in the class......right to a 2%.  I don't even believe it.  Period 6 - Golf:  Yay.  We had a match today.  At 2:30 PM PST.  Hell, did they care it was 115Â° out there?  No, we had to play.  We won, but barely.  Shit.  I DIDN' MAKE THE COACH HATE ME TODAY!  *feels great*

      I was going to blog yesterday.  In fact, I had it written out, but I deleted it just now because it sucked.  Anyhow, today was horrible.  If you don't know already,  I have some strange disorder.  I pick at my eyebrows.  For no reason.  So now they're horribly mismatched.  Screw that damned bio test.  I was so stressed over it I didn't realize I was disintegrating my right eyebrow.  Now I look like some ultra-demented freak.  Jesus Christ.  And no, I'm not Christian.  So sue me.  And some guy e-mailed me.  I was scared.    I watched  Tokyo Babylon  yesterday.  I decided to screencap baby Subaru, so I put the DVD in my computer.  Default setting was English with no subtitles.  Picture this. {whiny little voice} Subaru:  Saaaysheeroo?  UGH!  How could they do that to Subaru?  And Hokuto sounds like a freaking demented freak.  Worse than my eyebrows.  Hokuto-chan~ "Ohhh, I'm so glad it's all over!  I knew SOO-bah-ROO would be fine! Mirei~ "Who are you?" Hokuto-chan~ "I'm Hokuto!  SOO-bah-ROO SOO-murrah-GI's sister!

Period Tres ~ Fundamentals of Programming    Quote:   Me: {raises hand} Goodman:  {walks over} Me: {runs program} Goodman:  {stands there, totally clueless} Goodman:  Uhh.. oh.  Are you showing me that it runs? Me:  {-_-"}  Yeeees....   What Happened:  We had a lovely lil' FOP test today.  I had to program something that would ask the user into input two numbers.  Then, the smallest number would be the start number for a chart that would go to the bigger number.  The chart would show the numbers as they went up plus if they were odd or even.  THEN, it would count the number of even numbers and spit it out.  WANNA SEE MY PROGRAM?  *gringrin*  #include &lt;iostream.h> #include &lt;winsioux.h> #include &lt;iomanip.h> #include "apstring.h"  apstring comment(int x);  int main() { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int starting, ending; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"Enter a starting point:  "; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cin>>starting; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"Enter an ending point:  "; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cin&lt;&lt;ending;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;int sum=0;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cout&lt;&lt;setw(6)&lt;&lt;"Number"&lt;&lt;setw(30)&lt;&lt;"Comment about number"&lt;&lt;endl; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for(int x=starting;x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if(x%2==0) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum=sum+1; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sum=sum+0;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;setw(6)&lt;&lt;x&lt;&lt;setw(30)&lt;&lt;comment(x)&lt;&lt;endl; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cout&lt;&lt;"There are "&lt;&lt;sum&lt;&lt;" even numbers."&lt;&lt;endl;    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SIOUXsettings.asktosaveonclose=false; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return 0; }  apstring comment(int x) { &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if(x%2==0) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "even"; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return "odd"; }   OUCH, that was a LOT of coding.  Jesus.  I had to bput &amp;nbsp's everywhere and a WHOLE mess of &amp;lt's too... so it wouldn't interpret as a fricking HTML code thing.  -_-    Period Quater ~ PE    Quotes:   Me: Hey.  Did you just take the bio test? Frances:  Yeah.  I almost DIED! Me: Ouch. Frances:  Oh my god.. it raped me.. it was so hard! Me: ...    Random Guy:  You freaking NAZI! Frank: No, dumbass, I can't be Nazi, I ain't German. Me: You don't have to be German to be a Nazi, you idiot.  You just need to be a close-minded lamebrain with a superiority complex. Frank & Random Guy:  ...   What Happened:  Tennis.  In scorching heat.  Don't wanna talk about it.  *dies*    Lunch~KEY Club   Someone got salsa on my jeans.  My jeans are white.    Period Five~Latin I    Quote:    Ms. Kline:  Okay, Charlotte, could you translate the next line? Me:  Uh.. sure.. hold on... *reads*  Umm... I think I forgot to translate that.. um... hold on... Jessie:  {shoves her paper in my face}  Here! Ms. Kline:  Thank you, Jessie. Me:  {blink}  YOU forgot to translate it too! Jessie:  Whatt?!!!  I did?! Ms.  Kline:  {sigh}  Did EVERYONE forget to translate that line?!   What Happened:  Yeah, so I forgot to translate "clamorem mirabilem faciebant."  Well.. it was SO SHORT I didn't SEE the danged sentence!  *bangs head on keyboard*    Period Sex ~ Biology [Sex is 'six' in Latin.  -_- Freaks.]   Quote:   Caitlin:  Now if this were a test on Lord of the Rings, I would pass. Me:  {snort} And what makes you think I wouldn't?!  I've read almost everything Tolkien's written on Middle Earth. Caitlin:  Oh really?  {looks in book}  Book of Lost Tales I? Me:  Yes.  It was hard. Caitlin:  Book of Lost Tales II? Me:  Of course! Caitlin:  Shape of Middle Earth? Me:  Duh..  dude, just stop, I've read all twelve books of the History of Middle Earth series. Caitlin:  What? Me: -_-  Some Tolkien fan you are.   What Happened:  A test.  I don't wanna talk bout it.  I KNOW I failed.

       Dad:   So, I heard you and your friends were planning another reunion.  Me:   Errrrm.. ( DAMN!  How did he know?! ) yes....  Dad:   Is it at the same house again?  Me:   ( Oh crap.. he's going to mention the not sleeping thing... )  Yes....  Dad:   Okay.  That's fine by me.  Me:   ^_____________________________________^  What?  I was really afraid he would say no because he almost killed me last time for not sleeping.  Anyhow.   mood:   stupid..piano...  listening to:   Tomorrow {Weiss Kreuz} & Sadame (full) {X}     Period 0 - Geometry Honors:     What I Learned:   Triangles look PRETTY outlined in HOT PINK.  What Happened:   Oiiiii.  I forgot to do my homework yesterday and we had a pop quiz.  The question?  Copy numbers 4 & 7 from your homework w/out looking at the book.  X_X  I'm DEAD, boysies and girlies...  Then Rasch was teaching us how to prove triangles congruent and was outlining the stupid things in her *hot pink* white board marker.  I hate that color.     Period 1 - English 1 Honors:     What I Learned:   Jim can't play Tetris.  What Happened:   Ms. Lewis didn't come!  x_X  So I didn't have to slave over my lit log yesterday!  *grrrrr*  We just took the etymologies quizzle and the grammar quizzle.  Damn.  For once, I'm glad I did grammar homework in Mears.  Because the last time we did prepositional phrases before that was in... what... 5th grade?  Not like I learned anything in Mears' class.  Bah.  And Jim was playing Tetris on his TI-83.  His highest score?   1740 .  What a riot.  That's worse than me, and that's saying a lot.  *coughhighestscore25000somethingcough*     Period 2 - Geography/Nonwestern Cultures IB     What I Learned:   ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  What Happened:   Uggggh.  I hate this class!  It was so stupid.  All we did was stare at propaganda posters from Iran denouncing the United States and Soviet Union.  And the annoying prepubescent male population of the class was screaming out "STALIN!" in their nondeveloped squeaky voices.  Stalin never freaking showed up, you morons.     Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:     What I Learned:   Getting hit by a piece of paper is annoying.  What Happened:   Stupid.  Stupid stupid stupid stupid.  I didn't have my sweatshirt today, so Goodman caught me with my CD player on.  *bangs head on keyboard*  Not like it mattered.  He hates me already.  No brownie points for me, yay.  And it doesn't seem to matter that I'm the ONLY FREAKING PERSON in that row that can START a program without crying out for his help or someone else's help.     Period 4 - PE:     What I Learned:   Pushups are freaking PAINFUL.  What Happened:   Fitness Friday.  GAAAAAH.  Do you have any idea how PAINFUL Fitness Friday is?  An overview of what we poor little freshies had to do.    5 sets of 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  15 crunches  10 pushups  15 crunches  10 pushups  15 crunches  Leg lifts - scissor kick for 15 seconds  Leg lifts - elevator kick for 10 seconds  Leg lifts - elevator kick & patting stomach for 5 seconds  5 sets of 4-count jumping jacks  Stupid random sprints   5 sets of 4-count jumping jacks  More stupid random sprints  5 sets of 4-count jumping jacks  5 more sets of 4-count jumping jacks  Laps around the gym   And you ask me why I'm tired when PE is over.  Haaaaaaaaah.     Lunch - Latin Club    Ooh yay.. free pizza.. >__________     Period 5 - Latin     What I Learned:   The Easter Bunny stands for reproduction!  Hence the term 'f*** like rabbits'!  What Happened:   Lots of translating.  And a couple of lame ghost stories.  Made all the lamer by the fact that they were in Latin.  I mean, isn't that supposed to make it doubly exciting?  Dead story in dead language?  Yes.. no.. fine, be that way.     Period 6 - Biology     What I Learned:   Caitlin BUGS.  What Happened:   Lab. LAAAAAAAAb.  BORING LAB.

      Bloody heck.  Okay, today was freaking terrible and so I'll start out with nice, child-oriented words and then comes the onslaught of something... really terrible.  O-kay.   mood:  PISSED  listening to:  Spiritualized {Weiss Kreuz}   WHAT I LEARNED TODAY:  Period 0 - Geometry :  You see, there are these nifty things called TRIANGLES.  Some of them are the SAME.  These are called CONGRUENT.   Period 1 - English : If you squeeze someone's hand too hard, it explodes! Period 2 - NWCultures : Poor little Yemen is poor. Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming : How to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich:  You gather your materials.  Then you put your materials on the bread.  Then you put the bread together, and voila, you've got a PB&J sandwich.  Period 4 - PE: 1-2-3-4-T-1-2-3-4-R-1-2-3-4-O-1-2-3-4-Y-1-2-3-4-TROY! Period 5 - Latin : Her name is Melissa.  She coquits bene, cantats prettily, and is very sapiens. Period 6 - Biology : Take a sandwich, and BAM!  you have a plasma membrane.   Warning.  STRONG language ensues... -_-  Highlight to read.     Oh my god.. my mom is so fucking annoying!  She freaking was looking in my room and found my fucking music theory, which I didn't fucking do because I had too much shitty HOMEWORK.  So now she's all pissed at me.  She can fucking go to hell for all I care.  And she's all screaming at me because of my attitude.  Well FUCK OFF, bitch, and I won't bother you AT ALL.  Shit!  She's SO FUCKING ANNOYING.  If she EVER sees this blog, she can fucking cry all she wants.  Oh.  And she thinks I'm STARVING MYSELF.  WHAT THE FUCK?  I wouldn't starve myself if you PAID me to do it.  Jesus Christ.  I  cannot  live without sugar.  Okay?  I eat chocolate bars by the DOZEN.  And bitch, you think I'm STARVING myself to become THIN?  If you had paid any attention at all to me, I gave up trying to lose weight AGES ago.  Besides, I'm not even overweight......  ... yet.  BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT, SEE.   I just DETEST being called anorexic and/or bulemic when the whole of Troy High School is skinner than I am.  It's freaking ANNOYING.  I weigh.. what.. 115 pounds?  110?  105?  Who cares?  It's over 100.  For sure.  And I got SO MAD I got Spiritualized stuck in my head.    Again.    My little rant is over.  Good bye.

      MY HEAD HURTS LIKE A MOTHER!  OMFG.  OUCHIE.  POOR ICKLE PLATYPUS.  Period 0 - Biology: This is stupid.  I'm trying to decide whether or not we even have homework today.  Shiite.  Stupid Adams.  My God, I got a B on my test!  I thought I was going to fail!  Haha, I've never looked at tests this way in my entire life.  Period 1 - English 1: Yay.  Persuasive essays.  Shit.  That's all me be saying.  Shit.  You try reading Mr. Eckman's paper.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  My stuffs didn't die in the fire!  Yay!  Ouch.  Shit, my head hurts.  Yay!  I'm still going to fail this class!  period 3 - Algebra II:  Testie westie.  I think I actually passed.  HOly cow.  Period 4 - Drama: TONGUE TWISTERS!  I was runner-up just because.  Just because.  I lost to a senior.  Poor me.  A little freshie.  Against a senior. Shit.  I signed up for running tech for The Crucible.  What fun.  I figure if I'm going to have to work on the play, I might as well do something that I enjoy.  My God.  You know how many people signed up for, of all things, hair and make-up?  I was sad.  Oh yes.  We're all screwed.  America's doomed.  Just keep the genius presidents like Bush coming, and we're screwed.  Period 5 - World History: Yay.  Research on stupid migration during the Industrial Revolution?  Is that what it's called?  For God's sake, I don't even know.  Period 6 - Golf:  HOLY COW.  PRACTICE WAS CANCELLED!  YAY!  I ACTUALLY SLEPT FOR ABOUT 3 HOURS BEFORE DINNER TODAY!  Actually, no, I didn't even have dinner.  I thoguht I was going to barf.  Actually, no, I did barf, so forget it.

      My playlist is now officially 176 songs long.  30 are  X  songs, at least 70 are  Weiss Kreuz , 10 are  Yu-Gi-Oh! , and the others are all random anime songs.  I love Winamp.   mood:   a-ha.    listening to:  eX dream {X} and Sadame {X}   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   We had a good ol' substitute today.  DAMN, he was boring.  -_-  We just did PROOFS the ENTIRE period.  Do you know how ANNOYING proofs are?  *tears out hair*  DIE!  DIE, PROOFS, DIE!   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:   *snooooze*  No  Of Mice and Men  movie today for ickle Elfie.  We did peer response stuff for our essays.  And since Little Miss Talkative wasn't here, I had to switch with some guy I don't know.  Yeesh, Gus would tear up his essay within a matter of milliseconds.  It KILLED my eyes.  English honors my tail end.   Period 2 - Nonwestern Cultures:   More oil concession stuff.  We made 14 billion dollars!  *wise nod*   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:   Oh boy, this was fun.   More   for loops  and  if else  statements.  Curly brackets are truly annoying me now.   Period 4 - PE:   OH MY GOD.  We had THE MOST annoying substitute in the history of the world!  He was like.. 90 years old and was wearing shorts *cringes*  and acted like he was 25!  He made us do really retarded stretches, then told us to go play tennis.  Then, after the bell rang, he took roll.. AGAIN.. so we were all late for lunch.  Old men suck.   Lunch - Anime Club:   I listened to my muuusic... it was boring, though.  They couldn't get the DVD player to work.  Anyhow, I signed up for the committee on the wrong column.  I wanted to work with the secretary in the newspaper thing.  But now I'm stuck with reviewing anime.  Isn't that fun.  Yeah, normally I'd adore that.  But they'd probably make me review junk like  Rahxephon  and  Love Hina .  Ugh.   Period 5 - Latin:   Gotta love Latin, eh?  We had a quiz, then we did slave placards.. again.  Let me show you my Hannah one!       HANA  * Aegyptia {Yes, I made Hana Egyptian.}  * Hana est valida et sapiens.  * Hana est semper laeta.  * Numquam dormit, docet Latine, legit Latine          Anyone actually understand that?  xP   Period 6 - Biology:   ANOTHER substitute.  Oh well.  Finished my HW in class, so it wasn't bad.  ^_^

      I love school.  Almost as much as I love that accursed phone that sings "WE WILL WE WILL ROCK YOU" instead of ringing like every proper phone should.   mood:   peachy.  just peachy.  listening to:   Jeepstar {Weiss Kreuz} and Yasashii Yaoke {.hack//SIGN}   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   I was late for class >.   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:    *pouts*  Ms. Lewis lied!  She said we weren't going to watch  Of Mice and Men  and we DID!  So I was forced to listen to people around me crack lame jokes as we watched the adventures of two moronic men.  Yaaay.   Period 2 - Non-western Cultures IB:   We did some crapping 'oil concession.'  I had to be a Middle Eastern country.  Joy to the world.  I HATE this class!  It's so stupid!  We sold 2 billion barrels of oil to Western Country #1.  Yaaay.  They got oil!   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:   It was *yaaawwwnn*  in this class as usual.  Only I had to help.. three people... on those for loops because they didn't get it!  Anyhow, I was playing with if else and for loops and it was fun.  Really.  I'm starting to like C++.  I hate the class though.  And nobody made fun of Hiro Yuuki's voice today!  *claps*  O.o;;  Drew listened to my music and he didn't laugh at Hiro Yuuki!  Yay!  *pouts*  Kathy did though... ;_;  Whhy?  His voice is SO adorable!   Period 4 - PE:   A lap around the track and then me and Frances took turns whacking the tennis ball against a wall.  We both made it fly over the wall onto the tennis courts.  Whoop-sy.   Lunch - Key Club:   Death to KEY Club.  Death to their evil, evil pledge.  DEATH.   Period 5 - Latin:   Spent a great deal of time convincing Anthony that "avatar" was NOT derived from "avarus," Latin for "miser."  He STILL thinks it's derived from said Latin word.  Moron.  We were also making slave placards!  I got bored, and I needed two slave-girl placards, so I picked Vanessa and Hannah for names {HAH}.  Then for Hannah's skills, I put 'fights well and is smart.'  Or something utterly corny to that extent.  I also made them both Egyptian.  Yaaaay.   Period 6 - Biology:   We did a LAB!  Yep!  We poured hydrogen peroxide onto boiled liver, apple, onions, and potatoes.  We also poured it into liver, apple, onions, and potatoes soaked in hydrochloric acid.  And NaOH.  Whatever that is.

      Fun Fun Fun.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Yay.  Stupid Adams made us watch a stupid video that's got to be at least 50,000 years old on HOW TO USE A COMPOUND MICROSCOPE.  My God.  I have th ehightest grade in the class!  YES!  NO MORE CHICKEN BRAGGING, AND I BEAT THAT INSANE IDIOT WHO THINKS HE'S SMARTER THAN EVERY OTHER DAMNED PERSON WHO EXISTS!  Oh happy day.  Oh shit, I just remembered.  We have a test tomorrow.  Poo.  Watch my 94.6% drop down to a 4.6%.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  Yay, we finally got our new teacher.  He's like in his freakin 60's, and Mrs. Cook told us that he was young, somewhere in his mid-30's.  I was like, "Maybe that's young to you, but he's got twin sons who are 23!  My God.  That says a lot about how old you are..."  Oh yes, I have the highest grade in this class as well.  Yes!  And Idiot's in this class, too!  The Glory!  Period 2 - Ceramics:  Ugh....I don't even know what I have in this class until tomorrow.......  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Dammit.  This is the only class I don't have an A in, and therefore it is the only academic class in which I do not possess the highest grade.  Crap.  Period 4 - Introduction to Drama:  This was cool!  I actually have an A.    Period 5 - World History H:  An A!  The highest grade in the class!  Which means, obviously, I have once again thwarted that idiot's ideas!  Power to the Platypus.  Period 6 - Golf match:  Today was just a good day overall.  I actually got a respectable score....

      My dad is in a bad mood.  And speaking of my dad, he has attitude problems.  They're worse than mine, and that's saying freaking a lot.   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   A test.  I finished it, then I did English homework.  I hate this class.   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:  Etymology quiz and then a bunch of crap I failed to understand because I wasn't really listening at all... oops.   Period 2- Non-western Cultures IB:   This class was stupid.  We had to choose things for the peace conference, and I'm officially of the Likud Bloc Party.  Whatever that is.   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:   The networking was screwed, so I just typed up my program in an e-mail.  Yaaaay.  It was stupid.  I couldn't even listen to my music because there were two teachers in the classroom.  And to make matters worse, when I took out my binder I sliced my finger along the edge.  My pinky has a schism in it.  It hurts.   Homecoming Rally:   It was so unbearably pointless.  All they did was parade the homecoming court nominees down a red carpet with bright lights and play outdated pop music in the background.  Those NJROTC people had nice swords though.. *grin*   Period 4 - PE:  Oh gawd... I was totally insane during PE.  I think I ate too much chocolate, because I seriously could NOT stop giggling and laughing.  Me:   I can't *giggle*  stop *giggle* laughing!  Charmaine:   Think of someone dying.  Me:  *bursts out laughing*  Charmaine:   You're EVIL! But I stopped laughing soon, because Homer made us do (1) 20 jumping jacks (2) daily stretches (3) a set of Coach Homer jacks (jumping jacks like this:  1-2-3-C-1-2-3-O-1-2-3-A-1-2-3-C-1-2-3-H-1-2-3-H-1-2-3-O-1-2-3-M-1-2-3-E-1-2-3-R-1-2-3-Coach Homer!)  (4) 30 pushups (5) 60 crushes (6) 6 laps around the gym.  My poor pinky.   Period 5 - Latin:   NUFFINK.   Period 6 - Biology:   Accck!  *tears out hair*  I got a C+ on said 68 problem test EVEN WITH A 65 problem curve!  GAAAAAAH!

      Derek Fisher?  Oh, the Lakers.  Pssssh.  And now, school again.  I hate school.  School is bad.  School is mean.  School is... yeah.   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   This class is still a load of bull.  The teacher is, what, 55 years old?  And she thinks she's FUNNY.  HAAAAAH.  -_-  She put me to sleep four days in a row now.  Can you say HILARIOUS?  -_____________-"   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:   AAH.  We had to work in groups again and we had to PRESENT STUFF.  Dude.  I was going on about Candy's dog, and Lewis said something about their relationship and crap so I just randomly said "Like George and Lennie!"  and she thought I was a genius.  -_-   Period 2 - Nonwestern Cultures IB:   You do notice I spell the name of this class differently every day...?  Well, guess what?  I DON'T CARE.  We learned more shit about religions, which drove me insane.  I wanted to kill everyone that was Christian there because they were just.. GAAAAAAAH.  And we have to do a PEACE CONFERENCE.  Like I give a freaking hoot about the Palestinians and the Israelis.   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming:   Quizzie.  I hope I passed, because it would royally suck if I didn't.  I snuck in my CD player and was listening to  Stone Roses  after the quiz.  I don't think Goodman noticed.  Praise the Lord.  Or not.   Period 4 - PE:   We had a subby today, so we didn't have to run!  I was so happy!  And then it turns out I was jinxed or something, because every single time someone hit a tennis ball it managed to either (1) hit me or (2) come dangerously close to hitting me.  Frances hit me in the stomach.  It hurt.   Lunch - Meandering in the ICT Classroom:   Watching Catherine and Frances play around with wires and plugs and things I don't understand wasn't fun.  I felt like an idiot.  So I just stood there listening to Weiss.  Yaaay Weiss.   Period 5 - Latin:  I wanted to study for the freaking biology test, but we had to read about some slaves and then learn imperfect and perfect tenses.  Hella confusing when you're thinking about the endoplasmic system and plasmodemata crap at the same time.   Period 6 - Biology:   We took a 68 problem test.  I know I failed.  Once I got the test, I totally forgot what the hell a contracting vacuole was and what a damned centriole was.  It might have helped if I had remembered the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells too.  Daaaaaamn biology.     Platypus, written tests in  drama  are NOTHING compared to written tests in  PHYSICAL EDUCATION .  Yes, there are written tests in PE.  The horror of it all.

      AIYAH, ELFIE, WTF HAPPENED TO THE PIC OF DEREK FISHER THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THERE?  Ggrrrrrrrr.   Oh well.  Since he did so great yesterday when he started the game last night at 11, I'll be oh so nice and forgiving.  *big grin*  ANYHOO.....................................as Elfie put it, for SCHOOL!  Period 0 - Biology H:  Tell me.  What in the name of hell could possibly be more boring than listening to a 60-year-old man talking about sugars at 7:00 in the morning?  Hell, makes me want to suicide, knowing that I could be at home rather than listening to warped versions of " La Cockroach ."  Period 1 - English 1 H: I had to read my stupid essay.  In front of the class.  Hell.  Period 2 - Ceramic:  I'm seriously going to fail this damn class.  Good thing is, everyone else fail, too.  That makes me in the possession of one ot the highest grades out of the three classes!  Anyone bother to contradict me, screw you.  You go away.  Go to Hell.  It's my birthday, and I AM GOD.  I get to decide.  Oh yes.  *nodnod*  There, Elfie, aren't you happy?  God is on YOUR side.  God is an atheist.  What in the mother f***?????????  Period 3 - Algrbra 2 H:  Haha, everyone had to sing happy birthday to me!  Then Nicholson asked how old I was, and I said, "Fourteen."  And then the class was like, "OMG, you're so young......"  Dammit.  Logic's even more warped than mine.  Now that's a sad story.  Period 4 - Introduction to Drama:  Yay.  We have a written test on Friday.  A written test.  In drama, I ask you.  Period 5 - World History H:  Yay.  History Day.  Go screw yourself.  Period 6 - Golf:  Wow.  We went and played, and all the freshmen were in my group.  It was fun.  We all knew each other completely, so we just screwed around.  The teach wasn't with us, so we were f***ing around.  It was fun.  We realized that the only club you really needed to play was a driver; you could tee-off, use it as an iron, use it as a wedge, and use it as a putter.  We planned to use the putter to tee-off on the 7th hole since it was a short par 3, but the teach camed along and we was forced to stop and actually PLAY.  The horror.  Then, after we were done and waiting for our mommies and daddies to come get us, I sprayed Tiff with water.  She screamed and was like, "Shit, Jess, I can't get you back because it's your birthday."  I was like, "Hell yeah!" and sprayed her again.  One of the upperclass girls, a junior, thoguht it was funny.  So she gave Tiff her water bottle, which was full, and told Tiff to use it.  Tiff was like, "I can't."  So Kathy, the girl, did it for her.  Then Kelly, a soph, did it.  It was so funny....because all the members of the team think I'm hilariously and hopelessly funny...the coach was laughing so hard...and he's like 60.    Whatever.  Gots to do homework, and finsih before 9.  Lakers game on!  My god.  I have to do homework on my BIRTHDAY.  What the hell is up with that?  *innocent grin*

      HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Platypus! xDDDDDDDD   Click  urlLink here  to see your stupid birthday present! XD  I had to, I'm sorry.  And now, for SCHOOL!  Yay.  I hate school.   Period 0 - Geometry H:  I love this class.  I finished my geometry, English,  and  programming homework before the bell rang.  I was so damned proud of my self, you have no idea.   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:  BITE ME.  I got stuck with Caitlin again and now I have to write five S.O.S.'s for Candy from  Of Mice and Men .  Well, at least Kristy knows what  Neon Genesis Evangelion  is.  She knows what  X  is too.  Weeeeeee!!!  Bah.   Period 2 - NonWestern Cultures IB:   'Twas gay. We're learning about religions right now, and it was hard to keep from shouting out that God was a bunch of bullshit when there were rabid Christians and Jews all over the classroom.  Ah well.  We learned about Kosher pickles.   Period 3 - Programming:   Fun fun fun.  I didn't get to finish my apstring program because I only figured how to do it two minutes before the bell rang.  >.   Period 4 - PE:   We ran.   Lunch - Anime Club:   Oh my god.  We had a choice of what to watch :  Fushigi Yuugi ,  .hack//SIGN , or  Pretty Sammy  something.  CanNOT believe we ended up watching said anime with weird name.  Pretty Sammy Magical Girl.  Somefink like that.  Anyhow, they ALL sounded like Tot.  It was Tot-voice-land, I swear.  I wanted to smash the TV.  So I decided to calm myself by listening to  Weiss Kreuz  music.  Yaaay.  And the guy said they have  Weiss Kreuz Kapitel  in the library!  *squeals*  I WANTTTT...   Period 5 - Latin:   We gotted our quizzies back.  I had a 96.  x_X That's the worst I've done all year!  STUPID TRUE/FALSE QUESTIONS!  And "contendit" means HURRY, not RUN.  They could be POWER WALKING, you know!!!   Period 6 - Biology:   Holy crap.  We took notes the ENTIRE period.  Test tomorrow.  Guess who's gonna fail.  SCHOOL SUCKS.   HAPPY BIRTHDAY, PLATYPUS!

      OMG....MY BIRTHDAY IS ONLY TWO DAYS AWAY.  GOD, I'VE BEEN 13 FOREVER!  PERIOD 0 - Biology H: Omg.  Took a quizzie on the stupid element symbols.  FUN.  Then we looked at glucose, frucose, and galatose.  You have no idea how badly Adams sucks at teaching.  PERIOD 1 - English 1 H:  My God.  We have to write a persuasive essay: "Convince Jonas to change his mind about leaving the Community.  My God.  The horror.  PERIOD 2 - Ceramics: Haha.  I actually passed my first project....I got a 50/50, and the stupid thing looked like shit.  PERIOD 3 - Algebra 2 H:  OMFG.  I HAVE A C.  A C, I ASK YOU.  WHAT IN THE HELL WENT WRONG THERE?  BUT IT'S OK.  IT'S A 79%.  I'LL HAVE A B- ONCE SHE ADDS THE PARTICIPATION IN.  PERIOD 4 - Drama: What fun.  I was a drunk driver who ran everyone over.  PERIOD 5 - World History H: I tooked the test in 10 minutes.  15 multiple choice and 2 essay questions took me 10 minutes.  'Twas really sad.  Everyone else had 20 minutes.  But no, I had to leave for a damn golf match.  PERIOD 6 - MY GODDAMN GOLF MATCH: Those girls we played are LIARS.  It takes them like 50 strokes to get on the green, and 70 more to get in the hole, and their worst score was an 8?!?  My god.

      School sucks.  And I finally updated  urlLink Tiny Tenshi !  FINALLY!  xD   Mood:   Proud of myself  Listening to:   Tomorrow   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:   Oh lord.  We got out Quick Quiz results today.  Out of twelve problems, I managed to get  five  correct.  Five!  Wow.  I really need to get studying, ne?  But I can't memorize things and that's what Geometry  is !  A bunch of postulates and theorems!  *sob*  I'll never get into a good college...   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:   We took a quiz on  Of Mice and Men  chapter three.  'Twas stupid.  I failed it because I mixed up Crooks and Candy, and also because I didn't know why Curley's wife married Curley.  Physical attraction?  *shrug*   Period 2 - Geography/Non Western Cultures IB:   This class is a load of bull.  Farr thinks I do good on homework.  Sankyuu, Miss Farr.  -_- Failin' everything else though.  Luuurvely.   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming (Tech):  Ahahaha.  More if & else statements.  I think I understand it now.  I made a guessing game using file extensions (GIF, JPG, PNG, PHP, SHTML, CSS, HTML).  It was complicated and took me the whole damned period to finish.  Dionne made a stupid one with colors.  Bah.   Period 4 - PE:   OH MY GOD.  Life is so unfair.  Just because a bunch of  morons  wouldn't hurry up and get into their lines, we had to run laps.  >.   Period 5 - Latin:   We took a quizzie!  It was stupid.  Then we watched a movie about this guy that falls in love with this prostitute who's next door in the whore house who just happens to be a virgin.  And the prostitute thinks that the guy's dad is her owner, so she starts seducing him.  It's really wrong.   Period 6 - Biology:   *sings* Notes, notes, notes, notes, notes...

      HEY......MY BIRTHDAY'S COMING, TOO, YOU UNFRIENDLY LITTLE POOPHEAD!  Hahaha.  I was supposed to blog yesterday, so just pretend that this is yesterday's post.  Completely disregard the date.   Period 0 - Biology Honors:   This is stupid.  Adams is stupid.  Let's just leave it at that.  What fun.  I hate his class.  It's at 6:50 in the goddamn morning.  Do they seriously think someone can survive his class then?   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:   Haha.  This was actually fun.  We took an open-book quiz on The Giver.  So that one guy I was talking about sometime like a week or so ago who was the king in our French Revolution thing?  He got the last question wrong.  It asked, " What happened to Jonas and Gabe at the end of the story?"  He wrote they died.  Consequently, he got it wrong.  Haha.  What a loser.  So after the tests were graded, he got his back and he got a 19/20.  Then he saw what he got wrong and positively exploded.  Holy cow, that was funniful.  That answer was that Jonas and Gabe made it to Elsewhere.  He was like, "The book never stated he got to Elsewhere.  It didn't say he survived."  So then he picks a paragraph to back up his statement.  And take a guess at which paragraph the idiot chose.  This is what he read, the idiot: "Downward, downward, faster and faster.  Suddenly he was aware with certainty and joy that below, ahead, they were waiting for him; and that they were waiting, too, for the baby.  For the first time, he heard somethign that he knew to be music.  He heard people singing."  After that, he was like, "Where in that does it state that he made it to Elsewhere?"  The whole class was like, "YOU JUST READ IT, DUMBASS!" though not in those exact words.  My God, and he still as like, "Yes, but it doesn't say he made it to Elsewhere."  See, now I was pissed, and I was like, "OK, the book says that Elsewhere lay beyond, right?  At the bottom of the hill?"  And he was like, "Yeah."  So then I completely exploded and told him, "He's going down the hill on the sled, correct?  Therefore, gravity assures us that, dead or alive, Jonas and Gabe made it to Elsewhere."  Then the whole class laughed and then they were like, "Haha, Joseph, you got beat by a girl."  It was even funnier since he thought he was the best debator on the planet and he let everyone know about it.  And he still didn't give up!  My God!  He was like, "Yeah, but it never specifices whether or not he died, so my answer shoudl be correct!"  I was like, "Open your eyes, idiot.  The question asked for facts, not for your stupid, proofless opinion."  My God, I almost started up on my interpretation-opinion rant.  My God.  That would've taken hours.  Wow.  That was fun.  Next period sucked.   Period 2 - Cermaics:  This is stupid.  I'm failing this class.   Period 3 - Algebra 2 Honors:  This is stupid.  I'm failing this class, too.   Period 4 - Drama:  At least in this class I can do stupid stuff and get rewarded....   Period 5 - World History Honors : What fun.  The idiot is in this class.  He kept looking at me and mouthing, "They died."  I was like, "Does it look like I give a shit?"   Period 6 - Athletics:   I had the day off.  Fun.   I walked to Chinese School after I got home.  It was fun.  Tuna Fish bought me an ice cream for my birthday, which is more than anyone's done so far.......

      My father doesn't think very highly of me.  On the way back from piano lessons, he was teaching me how to avoid the cops.   Mood:   Offended  Listening to:   Weiss, Midorikawa Hikaru, and Toshihiko Seki   Period 0 - Geometry Honors:  Wow.  This is the hardest class I have!  The concepts are totally difficult to grasp.  I mean, seriously, today, we learned this uber-hard theorem.  This is how it goes:  "The sum of the measures of the angles of a triangle is 180."   -______-  *dripping sarcasm*  Oh wow, this is totally rocket science.   Period 1 - English 1 Honors:  We took a lovely little etymologies quiz that I'm quite sure I failed.  Not like that's anything new.  Then we looked at quotes from Steinbeck's  Of Mice and Men  and analyzed them.  Fun.   Period 2 - Geography/Non Western Cultures IB:   This was annoying.  One of my only IB classes is also the dumbest.  All we did was go to the library for (get this)  "Freshman Library Orientation."   Librarian:  All righty folks, this is how you access the Internet from the library.  You open the laptop, sign in, and double click the icon that says  Internet Explorer .  THEN, to go to the library homepage you must type in "http://www.troyhigh.com/resources/library/library.htm."   Me (in head): All right, Mrs. Librarian, that's lovely, but why couldn't you have made the "library.htm" to "index.htm" so that all you'd have to do is type in http://www.troyhigh.com/resources/library"?   Period 3 - Fundamentals of Programming (Tech):   HAHAAAAH.  This is supposed to be a class exclusive to the Troy Tech magnet program.  What a waste of time.  All you do is learn to program in C++.  Fun fun fun.  We did if and else statements today.  We also did some computer competency crap on Microsoft Access.  It was BO-RING.   Period 4 - PE:   Ack!  We had to run the Warrior Loop today.  For some reason, it was a lot easier than four weeks ago.  I also somehow improved my time by a minute.  o.O;;;  Maybe PE is actually keeping me in shape.  Boy, this is new.   Period 5 - Latin I:   Eh-heh.  WHAT I LEARNED IN LATIN CLASS:  In Ancient Rome, they had these neat little things called  Roman orgies .  We watched a movie.  It showed what happened in the Roman orgies.  Dude, not even that Aya x Omi layout prepared me for  that ...   Period 6 - Biology IB:   Oh the horror.  We did a lab and looked at pond scum through a microscope.  There was this little red worm-like thing that someone called a paramecium.  I didn't care.  I screamed anyway. After class, the teacher fed her snake.  I pitied the food - it was two adorable little mousies!  I wanted to save them, but Tom Riddle ate them.  I hate Harry Potter.  Oh goodie.  Yesterday my Internet broke.  Platypus knows about it; ask her.  And by the way,   HAPPY LATE 13TH BIRTHDAY, VANESSA!   Not like you're reading this.

      HOLY DIPSHIT YESTERDAY WAS FUNNY ASS!  OK.  But Wednesday and my whole weekend first.  Wednesday:  Well, condensed, took a damn bio test, took a Unit 4 English test, took a Chapter 4-2 test, and practice.  Fun.  Thursday:  Whoo-hoo.  Fun.  Slept until about 10:00 A.M.  Dad's friends came over around 4:30.  Big ass Thanksgiving dinner.  20-pound turkey.  Hell yeah.  Bunch of gravy.  Baked potato.  Potato salad.  Stuffs like that.  Friday:  Didn't do squat...went to Odie's house to make posters and shit for the alumni game....but dind't do shit squat.  Saturday:  Practice, ALUMNI GAME!  Whoo-hoo!  Damn, there were a lot of people there.  Man, I took a big hit, and my coaches were all there.  It was funny!  Haha.  Anyways.  Alumni game.  Last second of the half, Daphne throws up a half-court shot.  It goes in.  The whole SOC goes crazy ass.  FUNNY!  Last 5 seconds of the 4th quarter.  Tied at 55 each.  Alumni force a turnover at the other end.  Stacey's under the basket.  Nobody around for 50,000 miles.  Left side of the basket.  Right-handed shot.  I was like, "OK, shit, it's over!"  It's out.  I'm on the floor.  We sat in the first row.  I'm ON THE FLOOR.  LAUGHING MY ASS OFF.  FUNNY ASS.  Stacey's embarrassed as all hell.  Daphne's on the floor, slapping it.  I'm dying of laughter.  Daphne, Connie, and Trisha get Stacey and point over to where the team is sitting and where I'm rolling on the floor.  You should've seen Stacey's face.  It was like, "Oh, shit, I forgot Jessica and my whole group of kids are here."  She did that thing where she just shakes her head and is like, "Oh, shit."  It was funny.  She comes over.  I'm still on the floor laughing my ass off.  Man, I'm rolling around.  FUNNY.  What does she say?  "That just goes to show -- do as I say, not as I do."  Man.  I told her, soon as I stopped laughing, that she missed THREE lay-ups, and that all her shots, all left-side lay-ups, were taken with her right hand.  AND SHE MISSED THREE OF THEM.  oOo....the three other coaches were like, "Jessica, you are going to be runnnnnnnnnnnning....."  MAN!  FUNNY-ASS!  SHIT.  THAT WAS PROBABLY THE FUNNIEST THING I HAVE EVER, EVER WITNESSED.  LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  We need to replay that.  HELL.  FUCKING.  I want to watch it again.  Sunday:  Bio homework for 2.5 hours, lunch, english paper, math, world history, still not done.  Lakers game.

      Oh dear, I haven't been here for a while.  O.o;;; I'd wanted to create a layout and FTP it to S-A.net, but I haven't had the time.  Anyhow, back to my silly blog format.   Mood:  DROP DEAD TIRED.  Music:  "Saigo no Bansan" by Wei&szlig;  Random Thought:  Onions smell bad.  Currently:  Killing my eyes over this shitty, shitty monitor.  Currently @:  Vanessa's house; still haven't slept for a freaking minute.  AND THE NOSLEEPOVER CONTINUES... full force.  Well, not really.  We've run out of anime to watch; having seen  Inuyasha ,  Serial Experiments Lain ,  Wei&szlig; Kreuz ,  Wei&szlig; Kreuz Gl&uuml;hen ,  Yuugiou ,  X , and  Treasure Planet .  Okay, so  Treasure Planet  isn't anime, but it's got the most gorgeous animation in the universe.  Because it's Disney.  And Disney rocks my socks.  Which are, coincidentally, really dirty.  I should have worn those spiffy new Costco ones that my mom bought a few days ago.  Oh well.  Anyhow, a paragraph dedicated to the latest week of school.  In a nutshell, it sucked bilgewater.  Wednesday: five freaking tests.  Geometry, English, Programming, Latin, and Biology.  And out of all of those, I know, I just KNOW, that the only one I came even close to passing was Programming.  So, back to the nosleepover.  Hannah brought her shinai, kendo uniform, temperpedic pillow, and pizza pillow.  The second she got to Vanessa's house, she went to the bathroom and changed into her kendo uniform, then proceeded to [sort of] attack the wall with the shinai.  She says that it's in bad condition.  And for that, I am GLAD.  Yes, I am.  Spent a lot of time squealing over Gl&uuml;hen Ran.  He's just.. so.. gorgeous and.. so.. so.. [swoons and faints]  [starry eyes]    Anyhow, also read a bit of  Gravitation ,  Saiyuki ,  DN Angel ,  Yuugiou , and just in case you were wondering, we did NOT read the remix!  [dies]  Had a very long conversation on  Boku no Sexual Harrassment  and the CORN.  With mashed potatoes.  And, um, butter.  Dude, I will never look at corn the same way again.  Oh, and this morning, at breakfast, Hannah decided to read the ingredients to cookies and found.. um.. rape seed extract.  I really don't want to know what that is... [hides behind a chair]  ...    ...   Okay, that's all.

      People reeeeeeaaaaaaally suck.  XD  But some people rock.  [pats people that rock]   Mood:  Tired  Music:  "Perfect Stranger" by Weiß  Random Thought:  Ouch.  Currently:  Sulking.   Period 0 - Geometry Honors  Soo boring.  Learning that triangle's angles add up to 180 degrees is not my idea of high school math.  Bring the pitchforks!   Period 1 - English 1 Honors  Well, aside from the etymologies quiz which I failed, this was fun.  Yeah.  If sitting there getting plummeted with 'Will you be my FRIEND?' just because I got a freaking 92/100 on the essay is fun.  Surrounded by Koreans... speaking Korean.. gah.   Period 2 - NWC  Oy, this class was awesome.  Groups again, and Caitlin decided to flip her desk around and sit with US!  [dripping sarcasm] She was so INTERESTING!  [stiill dripping sarcasm]  Anyhow, when she flipped it around, Rachel started drawing ways to kill Caitlin (dagger, shot, gun, boxing glove, butcher knife, shoe bomb, crane w/ 100,000 lb. iron ball, strangulation, chainsaw, axe, saw, guillotine, hanging, voodoo doll, torpedo, grim reaper, flamethrower, bomb, scissors, drawing and quartering, pitchforks, electric chair, arsenic, boiling water, sharp objects, running over with a tractor (we were talking about Russian tractors in class), bow and arrow...).   Caitlin saw, and she started laughing (hahaha) and then suggested meat grinder.  She didn't realize she was... um.. helping us brainstorm ways to kill her.  So we started laughing.  And stayed laughing until the end of class.   Period 3 - FOP  Okay.  If you're reading this, [insert name here because I have NO CLUE what your name is] I DO NOT WANT TO TALK TO YOU.  STOP.  STANDING.  THERE.  Look, I don't know what your problem is, but you need to stop bothering me.  Right now.  I'm serious.  Any person with an OUNCE more brain cells than you have would have gotten the point by now, but I guess you haven't.  LEAVE ME ALONE.   Period 4 - PE  AAAARGGGGGGGGHHHH.  FUN FITNESS FRIDAY MY ASS.     5 4-count jumping jacks  5 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  25 crunches  10 pushups  25 crunches  3 sets of leg lifts  Sprints  Bizarre jumping exercises that was basically jumping rope.. w/out the rope  Laps around the gym    Sounds easy, but it's not.  And I ditched NJROTC for this.  Oy.   Period 5 - Latin  Boring.  Staring at naked men taking baths.  Eck.   Period 6 - Biology  More chainsaw fun.... but a lot of crap on meiosis and mitosis....

      Aiyah.....me ass still hurts.  Anyhoo.  I think I'll copy Elfie!  Mood: Happy  Music: Um....does Laker music count?  Well, technically, it's Knick music.  But the Knicks are down by like 18, so f*** that. Random Thought: Why don't people sell Peter Pan in a respectable manner?  Like in a STORE?  Damn.  It's Poo Poo's birthday today....I gotta get it before Saturday.  Currently: Wathing Basketball.  Derek Fisher just made one from downtown.  XD   High: I ditched practiced early..... Low: to go see the orthodontist.  Period 0 - Biology H  We....talked.  About C4 and CAM pathways.  It Elfie had TALKED to me yesterday, it would've been easy.  But no.  Why make it easy for Platypus?  Period 1 - English 1 H  Interviews.  Shit.  Period 2 - Ceramics Yuck.  I gotta finish this shit.  And my mask broke right down the middle.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Hell yeah!  My group found BOTH the convex solutions.  You wouldn't believe HOW MANY clues I gave the chicken....she still don't get it.  My God.  I was like, "Shit, how f***ing dumb are you?"  But of course, we all know the answer.  I also found the pattern, so now my group can find infinetly many solutions!  I get extra credit!  Whoo-hoo!  Period 4 - Drama  We played Guesstures!  It's like Cherades!  Um....we were "BIG Bottom."  The other team was, "Cotton Gum."  There was one period called the "Carpet Fuzz."  Where the hell do they get this..........?   Period 5 - World History H  We prepared for the debate!  We better kick ass.........  Period 6 - Basketball Fun.  I ditched early.  Stef and I wore our jerseys inside out and backwards.  It was fun.  9 of the people came up and told me that it was backwards.  xDDDDDDDDD  Afterschool  I went to the ortho, and the stupid thing in my mouth was dug into my gum.  Seriously, I think my ortho thinks everyone's a wuss.  But shit, when they took it out, it hurt like a mother.  She took out one side first, which forced the top part deeper into my gum.....shit.  It hurt.  By the way, Elfie, yes, your score was pathetic.  xDDDD

      Today wasn't that bad.  Oy.   Mood:  Happy  Music:  "The Real Folk Blues" by Kanno Yoko  Random Thought:  Black is good.  Currently:  Eating pistachios XD   High:  I wore black.. ALL DAY.  ^_______^;;; CTYness!  Low:  I forgot my Latin homework.  ;_;  And Barney's here.   Period 0 - Geometry H  I did my homework last night, so there.  XD  Class was boring as usual, the highlight being the bell at 7:57.   Period 1 - English 1 H  Eekp.  We did character presentations today, and I know I failed.  >.   Period 2 - NWC  She made a new seating arragement thingeh for the Russian thingeh!  XD  I somehow ditched Caitlin (Sorry, BUB.)  and am now sitting with Rachel, Krupa, and Emily.  Victory.     Break  Ran out of NWC and to the band room with Kathy.  Bandos are STUPID.  Oy.   Period 3 - FOP  Online test!  XD  I finished and then I was bored, so I made a list of my favorite seiyuu and their most major/cool voice roles on Notepad.  That is, after I typed out the lyrics to Velvet Underworld without looking at my binder.  >. Gravitation  section.  Eep.   Period 4 - PE  Football!  XD  Homer tried to kick the ball but he didn't make the field goal.  MWAHAHAHA.  -_-"   Anime Club  FLCL!  Caitlin says it's plotless.  FLCL is  not  plotless!  You want plotless?  Watch  Pokemon !     Period 5 - Latin I  @____________________@  'Nuff said.  Got a 50/50 on the test.  Crap.  I could've got a 51/50, but NOOOOOOO... WHY does Pompeiiani have to be second declension and WHY did I forget?!   Period 6 - Biology H  Played Tetris on my calculator instead of listening.  Highscore - 27,514.  Not bad, considering I haven't played in centuries.  Now watch as Jessica comes to ridicule me with her 50,000+ high score...   Afterschool  I'm hoooooooooooooome.  XD

      Oiiiiii.  My ass hurts.  No seriously, it does.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Shit....lecture.  Man, WACKO.  BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  Tooked a test on the Human Comedy.  Missed the last question.  Who the hell KNOWS what Willliam Saroyan won for his ickle play The Times of the Year?  Moreover, who the hell cares?!?  Period 2 - Ceramics:  F***ed around the entire period....................I gotta glaze all four projects tomorrow.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Yay.  More arithmetic series and sequences.  Period 4 - Drama:  An all-over boring period.  LUNCH - MIX IT UP DAY. Hell, we went to take Interact pictures first.  Then we went around talking to other people for MIX IT UP DAY, just to find a damn sticker!  I wanted a sticker.  We finally got one.  Damn.  We told the sports editor that Laura Higashi could dunk.  He knew her brother, and he was like, "No, are you shitting me?"  Shit, it was funny.  We were like, "No, seriously, dude, she's got hops.  She can dunk."  LOL.  Period 5 - World History H:  Test on "Nectar in a Sieve."  I got a 10/25.  That's better than I hoped for.  I hoped for a 5.  Period 6 - Basketball:  Man, we were breaking the press.  Laura (the DUNKER) threw a lob pass.  Seriouly, it was so far over me I really had to elevate to get it.  I'm in midair, and this one sophmore (Patrice) jumped INTO me in the opposite direction, so I landed hella hard on the side of my ass.  Shit.  So for the rest of practice, I sat on the sidelines.  Then Ed comes over with a big bag of ICE and tells me to put it up my shorts.  So I sit there for the rest of practice with an ice bag basically up my ass.  After practice, I took it out and tried to walk outside.  Man, IT HURT.  LOL.  xDDDDDDDDD.

      People suck.   Mood:  Beyond pissed  Music:  "Change the World" by V6  Random Thought:  People really suck.  Currently:  Plotting how to piss off my parents without losing rights to the computer   High:  I have my Gl&uuml;hen DVDs back!  Weeeeee!    Low:  My mom is... ANNOYING, to say the very, very least.   Period 0 - Geometry H  Haha.  Rasch caught me doing homework.  Oy.  She got mad.  Oh well.  I'll just do homework at home for once today and go back to my usual schedule on Thursday.   Period 1 - English 1 H  Class was stupid.  God, Caitlin is the slowest typistperson on the planet.  I swear, I can type this entire blog entry in the same time it takes her to type three freaking sentences.  I am so serious.  Oy.  And explaining computers to people never, ever works.  Louden is such an idiot.  He saved a picture in the "My Documents" folder and refused to listen to me when I said it was inside "Documents and Settings."  Dumbass.  If he had bothered to open that damned folder the 'My Documents' folder would be in it.   Key word here being DOCUMENTS, people.   Period 2 - NWC  God, does Farr EVER stop talking?   Break  Oh, fun.  Went out of NWC only to be followed by Caitlin.  I was talking to Dionne, and Caitlin kept... tailing me.  Oy.  So we ditched her outside and went back in, and to shorten everything, there were three minutes left for us to study FOP before class started.  Fun.   Period 3 - FOP  The test was easy.  Pah.   Period 4 - PE  More football.  We lost again.  XD   Lunch @ Key Club  [yawns]   Period 5 - Latin  Doom.  Test today.   Period 6 - Biology H  I PASSED THE TEST!  XDDDDDDDDDDDDD I got an AAAAA.  XDDDDDDDDDD

      DAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMIT.  Period 0 - Biology H: Damn bug test.  I swear I failed.  I spent about 5 hours studying for that damned test.  Then I fell asleep, completely omitting the pictoral section of the study guide.  I failed.  Blah.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  I LOVE this class.  Shit, it's probably one of my favorite classes.  DAMN.  This class is really really fun.  The teacher thinks I'm a genius just because I happened to answer everything on the pop quiz correctly, including the one about, "What is the name of the woman Homer had to deliver his first telegram to?"  Her name was mentioned ONCE, and I surprised him....I gave him her entire name.  Mrs. Rosa Esperanza Sandoval.  So yes.  I LOVE this class.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  Whoo-hoo!  I finished all my shit in time.  Dammit.  Now I have to glaze all 4 projets in one day. Bullshit.  Period 3 - ALgebra 2 H:  Damned POW.  Not going to get it.  Period 4 - Drama:  Fun.  We were supposed to be rehearsing, but nobody was.  period 5 - World History H:  Went up and got Nectar in a Seive.  Fun.  Afterschool:  Ditched....no bball practice.  We went to ask Greg for Stacey's pictures, and he's all like, "Oh shit.  I swear, guys, I'll bring it tomorrow."  This was a junior's conversation with a group of 3 lil female freshmen.  He's so funny.  He's like 6 foot some, and Laura's like 3 foot some.  There he was, telling us he'd bring it tomorrow.  It's so fun to pick on him.  I was making fun of his shot during practice....I had to run, but just because Stacey thought I was paying more attention to his shot than my own, which, conviently, was dead that day.  She made me run a set of double lines.  I seriously think she was kidding, but I did 'em anyways.

      Talkative people irk me.  Actually, let's rephrase this.  Talkative  blabbermouths  irk me.  And I have yet to answer my e-mail.  That wasn't very coherent.   Mood:   Full ^^;;  Music:  "House of Love" by Takehito Koyasu  Random Thought:  People are  urlLink hypocrites .  Currently:  Wondering what has happened to humanity   High:   I got e-mail!  XD    Low:   My dad bought me a dung-green jacket and expects me to wear it.  Oy.  Random Quote (Today in Bio):   Jason:   What are you?  Rachel:  ... Chinese.  Jason:  Wo ai nee!  [ "I love you" in Chinese; Jason was saying it to everybody]  Rachel:   That's nice.  Jason:   Ey, Charlotte!  Me:  [blinks]  Eeeeh?  Jason:  What nationality are you?  Me:  .. why?  Jason:  Just tell me!  An:  Don't tell!  Me:  Oh wait, did you say nationality?  Jason:  Yeah.  Me:  American.  People were laughing and he was cursing.  Shit, that was fun.    Period 0 - Geometry H  We got our tests back!  I was so damn surprised with my B, seeing as I left two proofs blank...  ^^;;;     Period 1 - English 1 H  Failed today's reading check quiz.  It's not  my  fault I don't pay attention to little details!  Geez, you'd think I'd learn by now, after having Gus for a tutor for.. three years?  I'm such an idiot, no?   Period 2 - NWC  Can class get more boring than this?  An entire period of notes, plus Farr laughing at herself at random intervals.  Can you say boring?  Most interesting part of class was when Dionne sent me her little note thingeh.  I'd scan it, but I'm afraid to expose her identity even more [coughs].  It basically consisted of lots of Ran-bashing and Kenshin-worshipping.  Why am I not surprised?  Meh.  Silly Kenshin fangirls.     Period 3 - FOP  [rolls over and plays dead]  We have a test tomorrow.  More Ranbashing.  BAAAAH.  Apparently she doesn't like Takehito Koyasu much either.  See, if she'd seen his teeth, I wouldn't blame her, but I've never showed them to her.  Ya think maybe I should?   Period 4 - PE  Football.  Our team is so bad it's funny.  Heh.   Lunch @ The Wishing Well  You know, the wishing well.  That dejected little pond in the corner of the 300 building.  Anyhow, me, Frances, Veronica, Erica, and An (and Brian.. and Sylvia... and David.. in a sense) were there.    Spent the entire lunch hour laughing our asses off, which wasn't the greatest preparation for fifth period in the world.  Blah.   Period 5 - Latin  Latin was hilarious.  We had a substitute so everyone was fooling around.  Heaven started playing "Me Against the Music," which made me gag, so I took out my CD player and Wood didn't notice.  Mwahaha.  I made Jessie listen to "The Road" and "Velvet Underworld," and she said Wei&szlig; just sounded like a random boy band.  Oy.  And then she made fun of J-pop.  Frikkin emo fans.  Screw emo.  Though she owns a Hikaru Utada CD.  Oy.   Period 6 - Biology H/IB  Another substitute!  Oy... class was so boring.  But it was fun.  Sorta.  In a sense.  Hah.  See quote above for details.  XD   Afterschool...  I found  urlLink thehatelistings.org  and was simply appalled at what I found.  I cannot believe anyone can be so devastatingly hypocritical as to start a  hatelisting  to something.  There was only  one  I identified with:  Ja Rule's hatelisting.  Because that object is the absolute worst example of an ithinki'mmakingmusicbuti'mreallynot artist.    Hell, everything's got a hatelisting.  Mazaki Anzu from Yuugiou, for one.  I don't  like  her, but I wouldn't join a  hatelisting  to her!  God.  And Yuuki Miaka from Fushigi Yuugi.  The  hell ?  You hate Miaka, you might as well hate the freaking series!  Get a grip!

      WEee.. I'm going to blog for the entire weekend right now, and then I'll go do theory.  Fuck you, CM.   Mood:  Still pissed  Music:  "Instant Karma" by Weiss Kreuz  Random Thought:  I hate teenagers.  Currently:  Fuming and looking at boring anime sites   High:  I'm still wearing my pajamas.  XDDD  Low:  My mom is a bitch.    SATURDAY:     Morning:  I woke up at 10:30 because of the damned sun.  T_T  I hate sunlight.  Die, sunlight, die.  Then I spent the rest of the morning making link buttons.  {points at  urlLink Tiny Tenshi linkage section  } See?   Afternoon:   I had to go to choir.  Stupid idiot in charge said he'd have their website up in a month when it was still September.  I still get a freaking DNS server error whenever I try going there.  Just freaking let ME do the site and you'll have the damned thing up in two days, you moron!   Night:  After choir, me and Jessica had to go to this big-ass house in Arcadia or something like that.  It was huge.  I thought Vanessa's house was big, but NOO, this whopper was twice her house's size.  T_T I am so serious.  It looked like  urlLink Dickinson College's  freaking library.  Only her doors were bigger than the college's.  For Christ's sake, the driveway had SPEED BUMPS.  Spent a lot of time there (well, not really-- four hours).  Read  urlLink The Best Page in the Universe  for an hour (that site is so damned entertaining), then me, Jessica Y, and Jessica F went upstairs and watched  Akira .  It was awesome.  Then after  Akira  we watched  Weiss Kreuz  because Jessica wanted to.  ^.^;;  We watched up to Ken vs. Kase, then I had to leave.  They were making fun of the animation.  XDDDD    SUNDAY:     Morning:  Woke up @ 6, but didn't actually climb out of bed until 8 or so.  Was lying there trying to make myself believe I was still back at  CTY.  X_X Pathetic, no?  Then I got up and.. was basically on the computer until.. now.  2:00 PM.  HAHAHA.  -.-"  Theory now.  Why the hell am I still taking piano?  Everyone else QUIT!  { destroys the CM } Die, die die die... Waste of $35. T_T  Just imagine.  When I get up to Level X (Gotta pass this time's Level IX first.. -.-), it'll be 41 wasted dollars.  Joy.

HELL YEAH!  AND I GOTTED A PAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  KISS ASS.....  Period 0 - Biology H:  STUPID ADAMS.  Almost nobody brought their book, but instead of just lecturing, he goes around and takes off 5 points.  HELLO.  DID YOU TELL US TO BRING OUR BOOK?  WHO WAS THE ONE WHO TOLD US  NOT  TO BRING OUR DAMN BOOK?!? SHIT........  Period 1 - English 1 H:  Hell.  I did my WWII interview....which I facking made up, and he was like, "That was a great presentation."  HAHA.  MUG shot test ruled!  Period 2 - Ceramis:  Stupid Isaisis......he didn't admit he put the wet clay in the bin.........dumbass.  There was clay in the sink...haha.  Shit, McGowen is so damn funny.  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H:  Hell, I got the highest grade in teh class.  AGAIN.  All the sophs were like, "What the hell is up with this freshie?"  HAHA.  FUNNY.  Period 4 - Drama:  Crap, Laura's scene was hella funny.........  LUNCH:  Rally.  Hell, it was sad.  I mean, if LA's such a big game, why not put us on rally schedule?  HAHAHA.  They had an LA pinata, and the co-captains of the football team came and bashed it hella up.  Facking funny.  Period 5 - World History H:  Finished doing somethign about Imperialism......don't remember.  Shit, there's something wrong with his grades........I get the first A on my test, and it lowers my grade by 3 % points?  What the hell is wrong here?  After school:  We drove by the mountain, and LA's sign was all screwed up with trashbags to make it look like a "W".  Not really.  If you looked at it at an angle, maybe, but not really.  HELL, KILL LA.  DO US A FAVOR AND  > KILL   THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!! HELL.

      Today was just... weird.  I think... I'm going to DIE... yep.  Back to my little.. blog format thingeh.  Haaaaaaah.   Mood:  Pissed  Music:  "Kawaita Sakebi" by Field of View  Random Thought:  Field of View shouldn't have disbanded.. ;_;  They're so awesome.  Currently:  Typing this.  And listening to FoV.   High:  That biology test was the easiest one all year!  XD  I think that I got a C!  { jumps up and down }  Oh, great.  Now I sound like.. Platypus.  >.>;;;  Low:  I know I failed that stupid geometry test.  Those proofs were  not  in English.  -_-"  At least, if they were, not a form of English that I understand.  Ha.  Ha. Ha.  -________-"   Period 0 - Geometry H  As I said, we had a test today.  It was... ha.  I could  not  figure out for the life of me how to prove those idiotic segments were congruent.  It was.. CONFUSING!  *nods*   Period 1 - English 1 H  @____@  This class wasn't that bad because Lewis is like.. my favorite teacher so far.  I actually passed the reading check quiz.  The first one I've passed all year, yay!   Period 2 - NWC  Nick wore a dress!  XDDDDD  That was the highlight of the period, I swear.  Everything else sucked.  Farr laughed at herself so many times I felt like whacking her with my binder.  My pretty, pretty binder.  *__________*  Jumped over the desk and sprinted outside the second the bell rang.  { blows raspberry }  I don't want to talk to you guys.  Shoo!   Period 3 - FOP  ... I finished the rock, paper, scissors crap yesterday.  So I just spent the entire period on the Plaza.  Sorta.  I had to keep closing the screen because Goodman kept coming.  He caught me.  But he didn't say anything.  ^_____^;;;;;   Period 4 - PE  Oh my god. DEATH.  Today was.. HORRID.  I would rather run a mile than do what we did.  My legs are still sore.  STUPID, STUPID PE.  Usually, on 'Fun Fitness Friday' we only run about 25-30 yard sprint/skipping/stupidlittlethingeh distances, but we did 40 yards for five minutes.  Actually, here's what we did.  Bite me, Homer.    Five 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  25 crunches  Five 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  25 crunches  Five 4-count jumping jacks  10 pushups  25 crunches  Stupid sprints for five minutes  Half a mile... (but get this)    1/8 mile  Stop, do 20 situps  1/8 mile  Stop, do 10 pushups  1/8 mile  Stop, do 20 situps  1/8 mile  Stop, do 10 pushups    Walk around the track until the bell rang   X___________X I hate PE.  There were pebbles in my shoe.  >.>;;;;     Lunch  We just went to the wishing well.  And... sat there.  And made fun of Gunn.  Because he went into Knox's room.  And he does that everyday.  Is he in love with Mr. Knox?  o.o;;;   Period 5 - Latin  I hate Latin.  I hate the people in my class. They're so.. shallow!  There's this majorly retarded junior named Heaven who bugs the living SHIT out of me.  Good God, does that girl have a  brain ?  Like, at ALL?  She is the MOST preppy, MOST slutty, and MOST brainless person in the entire universe.  ... Plus, she thinks she's pregnant.   Period 6 - Biology  Sticky icky photosynthesis test.  Haha.  Owie.    Yesterday after school was awesome.  Went home, killed myself, did some homework, studied a little.. got bombarded with IMs from Platypus telling me that Derek Fisher made the All Star ballot (!!)...  I didn't vote for him though.  XDDDD  Most of the people I voted for were Mavericks  (   ... Okay, that's me over with.

      HOLY SHIT IT WAS RAINING LIKE A MOTHER TODAY.  ME AND ODIE WENT OUTSIDE, AND GUESS WHAT.  I GOT HIT ON THE GODDAM HEAD.  WITH HAIL.  YES, THOSE LITTLE STUPID BLOCKS OF ICE.  SHIT.  BUT IT'S OK.  WE CAPTURED TWO OF THEM.  WE STUCK THEM IN THE FREEZER.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Test.  My god.  It was so much better than last time's test.  I'm hoping for a C this time!  Not a D!  A C!  I actually have enough confidence to hope for a C!  Hell yeah!  Period 1 - English 1H: Whoo-hoo.  I bullshited my interview with a WWII survivor......it was a total spin-off of Chicken's.  Hell, it was fun writing it.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  What fun.  Jessica is on a roll!  Two projects in one day!  Hell yeah!  Period 3 - Algebra 2H:  Another test.  Holy shit.  My stupid feasible region turned out ALL WRONG.  I just hope that the rest of the test works better.  Period 4 - Drama:  Whatever.  Scene goes up tomorrow.  Hell.  Period 5 - World History H:  All right.....an imperilism   &lt;Shameless Elfie Edit:  It's "imperialism," dear.  ^.^"&gt;  activity.....whatever.  This class is....well, the only oen I'm passing.  Period 6 - Basketball:  I got my program chagned today....I'm actually in basketball now.  Wow.  OMG.  Nobody changed today.  We were all hoping we didn't have the gym so we wouldn't have to play because it was so cold, but we just HAD to get the grm.  Whatever.  So about 20 girls changed in the girls' restroom.  Then we open the door and it is facking POURING outside.  After practice, we open the door.  It is nothing but mother facking SPRINKLING.  Crikey.  Then we get to Odie's house.  Holy shit it was funny.  Me and Odie saw lightning about 50000 times, and Chicken could never see it.  The TV signal was cut off about 4 times, and I was talking to my daddy, and then the phone line DIED.  Shit.....wacko.  Then we realized it was HAILING.  Hell yeah.  So me and Odie go outside.  I got hit on the head.  We saw lightning, too.  It was quite scary.  You try being outside and seeing lightning flash something like 10 feet in front of you.  As revenge, me and Odie captured two pieces of hail and imprisoned them in the damn freezer.  HAHAHHAHAAHA.  I WIN, YOU LOSE.

      Baka.  Baka baka baka...  Anyhow, I'm in programming, and I am in a  VERY BAD MOOD .  We have a sub (that's why I'm online) and he's frigging ANNOYING.  He's freaking walking all over the classroom and staring at you as you type.  Goddammit.  He's at the computer across from me right now, so I'm okay.  For the time being anyway.  Oh my god... FOP boy is SO ANNOYING... if he pokes me ONE MORE TIME I will SCREAM.  Maybe I'll actually consider doing what Hannah told me to do.. o.o;;; See what happens.  Heh.  Still wondering why the Lakers couldn't beat the Hornets.. Haha.. Lakers suck.. >.>;;;;  Still can't wait for November 28th.  Come on, you stupid day, GET CLOSER!  ;_;  I've had enough of sensible anime freak deprivation!  Anime Club has... CARTOON NETWORK ANIME FANS IN IT!  *dies and revives*  Anyhow... -.-  I'm so bored... I need.. a knife... must.. kill... o.O;;;;  AAAAAAAAANNNNYYYYYYYYYhow... nobody's joining my fanlisting.  -_-"  Weiss Kreuz music is PRETTY!   urlLink JOIN IT JOIN IT JOIN IT PLEEEAAASSEEEE?   Plug of the day is over.. yay.  TT's going to kill me someday.  I spent so much shitting time on that layout, only to screw it all up.. ;_;  Quoth Dionne:  "Dude.. you need a life.  Have you ever considered going, uh.. OUTSIDE to you know.. watch movies and go.. shopping?"  Dionne, I hate shopping.  The last time I went to a movie theater was December 28, 2002.    ... The last movie I've watched outside of theaters was the Weiss Kreuz OVA.  Hahaha.  And part of the Tokyo Babylon movie thingeh when Hannah came over.  I scared her.  MWAHAHHAHAHA.  Drewperson just called WK Waiss Cruise.  I'm going to go insane.  It's WEISS KREUZ!  (VICE KROYZ!)  HOW HARD IS THAT TO GRASP, YOU FREAKING MANGY MORONS?!!!!111oneone!!eononeonene11  Anyhow.. >.>;;;;  Gravitation anime is pretty.  *_*  Gravitation remix is disgusting.  o.o;;;  And Hannah told me to read  Yami no Matsuei .  *blink*  I don't understand YnM!  At all!  *dies*  Is it supposed to be that hard to understand?  The only thing I know about it is that Tsuzukiperson is voiced by Shin'ichirou Miki!  (*_*)  I love Miki-san.... to some extent.  His hair scares me.  He doesn't look human half the time.  Drewperson is calling himself an idiot.  What an idiot.   Later.. after getting back home ^^;;;   It's raining like a mother outside.  There's thunder.  Plus a nationalweatherthingy warning of.. flash floods.  What the hell is a flash flood?  *totally confused*  Anyhow, um... hello.   urlLink Join my fanlisting?   *smiles*  If you want to put me in a good mood.. HOLY SHIT IT'S RAINING HARD... you should join it.  XDDDDD  I'm kidding, ya know.   Oh my god.. it's raining.. REALLY, REALLY HARD.  I'm worried.  >.  ;____________________________________________________;  By the way.... just so you know, that... person in FOP?  I will kill him.  Someday.  Yes.  I will.

      LOL.. I should really blog more often, ne?  Then people know I'm alive and crap... anyhow there wasn't any school today so I should have been doing homework all day.  I didn't, though.  Oops.   music:  Yasashii Gogo (DN Angel)  The Mavericks pulverized the Hornets (125-97 OH YEAH), which makes me wonder why the Lakers didn't win against them *coughTHEYSUCKcough*.  The Mavs are awesome.  Worship.  Anyhow, I changed  urlLink TT's  layout because I was bored of the old one.  The new one reeks, though.  >.>;;;  Yaaay.  Hannah came over on Sunday *waves*.  That was interesting.  Bon-bons.  Heh.  Can't wait 'til November 28th.  Why must school be so utterly bothersome?

      Hello all.  I feel sick... damned Warrior Loop.  Argh.  Half a mile of X_X.  At least I think it's half a mile.  It seems shorter than Mesa's half mile.  *shrugs*  Who cares?  I passed it, and that's what matters.  And I don't run very fast either.  Heh.   music:  Lost Planet  I can't believe the Lakers won by so little.  -_-" I mean, sure, the Spurs have Malik Rose {kills} and Ginobli {kills}, but they didn't have Duncan {mutilates} or Parker {mutilates}!  And yet our lovely Lakers have both Mr. Cross-Eyed and Mr. In-Deep-Shit and yet they  still  had to go into double overtime.  The idiots.  DON'T tell me that the Mavs lost to the Raptors; I know what already.  Damn Raptors.  And someone dared me to do this, so here goes.. *winces*  JPOP ROX MY SOX!  EEK.  That wasn't me; I swear.  I swear.  I have piano lessons today.  I don't think I'll survive.     I want my Glühen DVDs back.  Givvem back.   1st Week Warrior Loop~ 5:45  2nd Week Warrior Loop~ 4:15   3rd Week Warrior Loop (today) ~ 3:53  that  happen?  Anyhow, have a nice day.

      Jessica told me to blog yesterday but I was too tired and too pissed off.  I'm weird like that sometimes.  Don't even START.   music:  Kawaita Sakebi (haven't listened to this song in ages.. I love it... such wonderful memories ^^)  quote:  {Latin}  John:  Stupid Irish mafia.  Nick:  HEY!  It's better than your stupid ASIAN one!  They can't shoot for crap!  John:  So?  What the hell are YOU going to do, throw PIZZAS at us?!  Everyone:  {cracks up}  Today was stupid.  I almost died three times.  Not like you care, though.  And I realize that.  So bug off.  Nothing really exciting happened today except.. um... nothing.  Yeah.  *sigh*  Mavericks got dissed  AGAIN .  Just because they have a whole shitload of potential allstars on the team does NOT mean that they should have a perfect record.  X_X  Besides, Antoine Walker is ugly.    ... that had nothing to do with what I was saying.   By the way, I watched the Wei&szlig; Kreuz OVA yesterday.  It was really amusing.  Aya was wearing leather.  Leather and Aya don't mix.  And Weiss really shouldn't travel the country selling flowers.  It makes them look... gay.  And WK is very, very straight.  Except for Omi's constant clinging to Ken.  *argh*

      Oh shit good.  Now I gotta worry about Elfie coming and attacking me by stabbing me in the damned neck.  SHIT.  Hell, I've got enough fucking problems.    Biology H -- Period 0:  DO NOT TALK TO ME ABOUT THIS CLASS.  GO AWAY.  English 1 H --  Period 1: Shit, this class is hella funnnnnnnny.  No, not fun.  Just funny.  I get to argue about grammar!  Shit, I'm in heaven this period.  As a plus, it's first period, and only about three people have a zero period, so they're all asleep.  Arguing it just plain fun, but arguing about grammar kicks ASS.  Ceramis -- Period 2: Finally.  Damn new clay.  It actually works.  Trust me.  I was actually able to use a damn coil extructor.  I couldn't use it when we had shitty clay.  The clay was too hard to make into coils.  IT WAS ACTUALLY EASY TODAY!  Wow!  I might pass.  No, I won't, but it can't hurt to try.  Algebra 2 H -- Period 3:  Yay.  Linear programming.  FUCK OFF.  Drama -- Period 4: Damn.  My partner is crazy ass.  She's weirdoooooooooo.  World History H -- Period 5:  We're screwed.

      Cat in the hat?  This girl in my class has Paul Frank ones.  She was wearing them on Halloween and showing them to everyone.  Do you have any idea how disgusting that is?  You just DON'T go around showing people your boxers!  In other random news, my domain works and so I'm working on a layout for it.  It's LotR.  I haven't thought about LotR for a while and I miss it.  I really need to cool down off this anime thing so I can properly go insane on November 28th.    Let me guess.  Chicken bragged and said "Oh my god!  I beat you?!  REALLY?!"    *scowls*  Her and her stupid, stupid superiority complex problems.    And speaking of problems, my dad has issues.  He was screaming at me today about being more "considerate" and to stop walking around with a "long face."  Hahahaha.  One of my pet peeves (my biggest pet peeve, in fact) is a freaking hypocritical eat-your-own-words idiot.  And guess what my dad is.  He tells me to walk around happy.  The HELL?  You think HE walks around happy and smiling?  Shit no!  He's one of THE WORST people at hiding feelings.  Ever.  And he's telling ME to do it, and that life has been too SIMPLE for me.  Simple.  Ha.  My life is anything  but  simple.  He doesn't realize (he doesn't fucking KNOW me) that I'm clinically depressed and have been for quite some time.  I'm stressed, I can't stand my life, but I'm not suicidal.  I'm homicidal.  I get these strange urges to kill people.  I dream about stinking knives through people.  I start staring at someone in class and thinking about how they would look like with a rope around their neck.  Does that scare you?  Well, hell, it scares me.  Which is why I'm going to lay off the assassin killing bloody gory anime for a while.  Time to soak myself in happy YuGiOh land.  Er, anime that is.  The manga's gory.     But don't worry.  I won't dream about killing you unless you piss me off... a lot.  Like, a lot a lot.   Bio test today.  I think I failed.  The history test was so damned easy.    Presentation tomorrow.  Gotta finish.

      Not just any boxers, mind you.  THEY'RE CAT IN THE HAT ONES.  There's a difference.  So anyhoo.  To the evil tyrannical system called school.  Biology -- Period 0 : Die, god dammit.  I got a C.  Guess what Chicken got.  A B.  Guess what Chicken did.  English 1 -- Period 1: Yay.  I actually have a solid A now.  Ceramics -- Period 2:  Screw.  I'm going to fail.  ALgebra 2 -- Peiod 3 : Yay.  Switched seats.  WHat fun.  Drama -- Period 4: DAmmit.  Two person scenes go up soon, and running tech starts for The Crucible.  World History -- Period 5: Gotta find damn books for the stupid History Day.  Golf -- Period 6 : I get swtiched to basketball next week.  About time.

      Platypus has boxers.   Haha.  Oh man, that's precious.   Anyhow, I can't talk to anyone in my family.  My family sucks.  My mom is a talkative blabbermouth and my dad is an insensitive piece of mud.  And I have a domain, but it doesn't work.  You know, my life really, really sucks.  I need a host for my Weiss Kreuz music fanlisting.  If I can get my domain to work, never mind to that, but I can't get the damned thing to work!  *kicks*   If I DO get my domain to work, I'm going to have fun with fanlistings.  For one, there NEEDS to be a Dallas Mavericks fanlisting.. and people had BETTER join or ELSE.  *fumes*  Stupid Lakers.  STUPID, STUPID LAKERS.  I want my LiveJournal.  I lost the username and password, and the email I used to join it was my ATT worldnet one from five years ago.  Yes, five years ago.  Back in the days of the dreaded DIALUP CONNECTION.  Anyhow, been trying to figure out a plot for Weiss Kreuz.  *thinks*  I mean, because the second half is really terrible.  There is no plot.  Aya doesn't even want to kill Takatori anymore, because said Takatori is already dead.  *sulks*  No more random "TAKATORI SHI-NE!".  Damn, no more FLOWERSHOP.   Anyhow.  I'm too tired to write anymore...

Hell yeah, I get CABLE on Wednesday.  No, Elfie, I don't give a damn that you've had it practically since the invention of cable TV.  Holy shit.  Mommy got Platypus boxers!  They're Cat in the Hat ones.  I need them so badly.  The sophs and upperclassmen like to pants the frosh, so almost everyone has got boxers nowadays.  HELL YEAH.  Anyhoo, must go and watch the LTV now...........

      IIIIII AAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBAAAAAAAAAAAACCCCCCCCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!  WOOT!  I LOVE L.A.!  Ok.  My trip in a goddamn nutshell.   Thursday, December 25, 2003 :  Left house around 11:30 A.M.  Went and ate noodles.  Got to the goddamn airport around 1:00 P.M.  So then I decided, "OK, I'm going to take a piss, and then we're going to board."  Ha.  That's what I thought.  Then I ask my dad what time our plane leaves, and he's like, "4:30," at which point my jaw died on me.  Just about maxed out my cell phone talking to Chicken and Monkey.  Blah.  Whatever.  Arrived in Seattle around 6:45 P.M.  Went to my dad's friend's house.  Slept.  Ta-da!  Friday, December 26, 2003 :  Let's see.  Basically, in the morning, we ran around downtown Seattle.  oOoo I sawed the KeyArena...it's where the Sonics play, and pitiful as they are, they're still an NBA team.  We went to eat in the Space Needle.  Ya know, the big, tall, pointy thing.  Oh my fucking god have you any idea how expensive that food is?  Haha.  A damn bowl of soup is 13 goddamn bucks.  Blah blah blah.  Basically, the two main courses that we ordered died.  They never came.  So we ditched.  Then we went on some cruise.  OoooOoO their hot chocolate was good!  We went through some lock system.  It's used to raise and lower ships trying to get from freshwater to saltwater, and vice versa.  The water levels are different, see.  Yeah.  Then we went and ate Sushi Land.  Holy shit, that shit is GOOOOOOD!  It's sushi!  My god, my brother ate about 70 pieces of smelt roe sushi.  Anyhow.  On to the next day.  Saturday, December 27, 2003 :  Woot!  We went and visited a damn salmon hatchery!  Yay!  BORING!  Then we went to some Snoqualmie Falls thing.  It's a waterfall.  *nodnod*  We decisded to head down to the base of the lovely waterfall, and at the bottom there were these two people who had just caught two huge ass steelhead trout fish.  Then I got mad at my dad and then I just stomped up to the top. My god it was about 20 degrees outside.  My God.  Then we went to some state park thing, and IT STARTED TO SNOW.  HOLY SHIT I HAD NEVER SEEN SNOW BEFORE.  I WAS IN GODDAMN HEAVEN!  BOO-YAH!  Please keep in mind that this is nothing but a mere run-down of what I did.  If I elaborate any further, my computer will explode from being on too long.  We then departed for the University of Washington.  Saw the locks from up on land.  Yay.   Sunday, December 28, 2003 :  BORING.  So we drive to Vancouver.  CANADA!  HELL YEAH!  Anyhow.  We end up eating at a Chinese restaurant in Vancouver.  Haha.  So halfway through our meal, the table behind us vacates, so a new group of people comes in.  All of a sudden, one person bumps into a waiter, and then plates are everywhere and there's soy sauce pouring down my mom's back.  Haha.  AND SHE WAS WEARING YELLOW!  Whatever.  Yeah.  So that was the highlight of the day.  It took forever to get across the border.  It was actually pretty nice weather.  Woot!  We ate Sushi Land again!  Monday, December 29, 2003 :  Wow.  This day was boring, too.  We walked along a bridge for about an hour, and then we decided to go to an ice cave.  Too bad it was closed.  Haha.  So we ended up going to Kirkland, WA.  *You notice that's the name of the brand of Costco goods*   Tuesday, December 30, 2003 :  oOooo This day was fun!  We went to the Museum of Flight.  Naturally, I was crazy excited, and so was my dad.  OMG.  Then my brother and I did something that we had never done before.  We actually paid to get onto a sumulator!  See, first of all, my parents NEVER let us go on those rides that cost extra money, even after an admissions ticket.  Second of all, I've never been on a GODDAMN SIMULATOR!!!!!  HELL YOU HAVE NO GODFUCKING IDEA HOW EXCITED I WAS!!!  OH MY GOD.  So basically, my brother and I were in that thing for four minutes just spinning the shit outta ourselves.  MY GOD IT WAS FUN!  oOoo and then we saw all about the Apollo missions and such.  MY GOD I WAS IN GODDAMN HEAVEN.  OMG THEN WE WENT ON AIR FORCE ONE.  Not the one Bush rides around on..GOOD GOD I WOULDN'T EVEN CONSIDERING GOING ON  THAT  ONE.  It was the one that took Nixon home after he resigned....but whatever.  Hell, my dad took a picture of me imitating Nixon's farewell wave.  HELL YEAH.  We stood outside for about 3 hours in the damn 20 degree weather.  Helllllll it was FREEZING!  FROSTBITE...psh.  OK.  In the afternoon, we go to the Museum of Glass, but we didn't go inside for the tour.  Dammit.  I wanted to.  Whatever.  OK.  So we go back to their house.  SHIT IT STARTS SNOWING LIKE CRAZY.  Our plane flight home was scheduled for 7:30 A.M. today.  So, before the big snowstorm, we had settled on leaving around 5 and getting there around 5:30 in the morning.  But since it was snowing, there was no way to be sure that it would be safe to drive that early in the morning, since the snow would become ice and sleet overnight.  So we leave for the airport right then.  We get to the airport around 11:30 P.M.  So we sleep at the airport.  There were a lot of people sleeping at the airport.  Yup.  By the time we actually found seats, it was this morning.  Wednesday, December 31, 2003 :  So it's about 12:00 at midnight this morning and we just sleep on the seats at the airport.  This fat person sat next to me.  It was hard to sleeeeeeeeeeep.  Aiyah.  My parents didn't get any sleep.  Yeah.  We took a 32-seater from Seattle to Portland, and then we switched to a Boeing 737-400 plane from Portland to Ontario.  Then I came home.  Shit.  That took a long time.  It's almost New Year's.  HAPPY NEW YEAR'S!!!!

      Feh, I think Jessica's in Seattle, so I'm alone in L.A. being really, really bored.  T_T  Anyway I've been neglecting this, partially because I cleared my godfucked cookies and forgot my blogger username, until I remembered it was the same as my screen name.  I hate  Finding Nemo .  It's pissing me off.  One more person whines about how cute the little piece of orange crap is and I will explode.  I'm already really close to the top, having read several severely perverted  Weiss Kreuz  fanfictions.  I also read a doujinshi.. but.. THAT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.  O_O  Yes, Dionne, innocent little me reads doujinshi.  It's not  explicit  doujinshi, mind.  Toy Box.  [cough]   Hikaru no Go  doujinshi.  Crap.  The kids are in sixth grade.  LEAVE THEM ALONE, DAMMIT.   Meh, I joined K's fanlisting today.  Even though I don't like Gravitation that much, I joined K's fanlisting.  Why?  Because it's impossible not to love K, because K is K and you must love him.  Boo-ya.  I want his gun.  [pout]  Heeheehee.. I'm sleepy.

      I'm so bored.....just got back from the SOC Christmas party thing....I DIDN'T LIKE THE SEATING ARRANGEMENTS AT ALL!  Jesus Christ.  I sat across from Daphne AND Stacey!  Jesus.  Michelle and I were there first.  So Michelle comes to the first chair available and just sits.  Right in the middle of the table.  STacey comes and sits right across from me!  JESUS CHRIST!  That food was shit!  The turkey was all salty and shit.  I was telling Daphne, "This is like fish!  YOu touch it with the knife and it crumbles like fishie."  So Daphne's all like, "Yeah."  Soon as that happens, this waiter shows up behind me and goes, "Would you like more sprite?"  SO Daphne and I were just like, "Oh shit...."  Haha.  We played the stealing game with presents.  Basically, everyone gets a number and then number 1 gets to pick a gift from the big pile.  Number 1 opens it, and then number 2 gets to decide whether they want to steal it or pick another gift.  Shit, everything was like lotion and stuffs.  NOBODY STOLE ANYTHING!  Stacey was like, "You dorks!  You're supposed to steal things!  That's why it's called the Stealing Game."  So I was like, "OK, shit,  I'm going to steal something."  And I'm all doing my trash-talking that they're all used to.  Until, of course, the person before me gets LOTION and PERFUME.  So I'm just like, "Oh shit, I don't want that."  So then they all razz on for a while.  I get some stationary thing.  Haha.  Mommy bought an Old Navy sweatshirt thing.  It was the right size for anyone but Laura.  WHo picks it?  Laura does.  Haha.  It gets stolen for a little while.  Overall, it was okay.  THen we played a game with money.  HOLY SHIT DAPHNE WON.  Haha.  She was all happy.  She won $24.  She was all like, "That's my McDonald's lunch money for the next two weeks."  She works at WalMart.  THere's a McDonald's in there.  Haha.  Shit.  I have a game tomorrow at 9:00 A.M.  Good night.  Oh shit.  Speaking of games.  Saturday.  See, our team is used to killing teams.  We got killed, to put it short, and rather nicely.  They had this one player.  Shit, she had MAD hops.  SHe had MAD handles.  Jesus.  Before the game, the coaches were like, "Their point can't dribble.  Pop the ball every time."  So we go out there, and we're like, "Um.....coach?  I think she can dribble."  Seriously, she had Daphne handles.  CRAZY ASS.  But they cheated.  She's varsity.  If they have to cheat to win a  JV  tournament.....psh.  Night.

      Today, I watched  The Return of the King .   Mood:  Tired  Music:  "Ashita moshi kimi ga kowaretemo" by Wands  Currently:  Sulking  Currently At:  Home  [tiredly sings along to Winamp]  I love this song.  Yes, I watched RotK.  And before you ask me what I thought of it, I think I must tell you all something.    I LOVE THE LORD OF THE RINGS.   I love Tolkien.  I adored the book.  I adored the FotR movie.  I thought the TTT movie was pushing it a little.  I  hated  the RotK movie.  HATED it.  It was TERRIBLE.  And the Legolas on the oliphaunt scene was the poorest CG I've ever seen.  It's right up there with  Fantastic Journey *.  Way to go, PJ, you made my day.  * For those in the dark, a lame sci-fi movie released in the 1960s.  Special effects included lots of flashing lights and smoke.  Basically, man gets sick.  Scientists shrink little mobile thing with people inside.  Little mobile thing goes into sick man.  FANTASTIC JOURNEY HAPPENS.  Not only that, but they totally downplayed the Faramir/Eowyn relationship, which happens to be my favorite Tolkien pairing ever (barring Beren & L&uacute;thien).  And Denethor's death was  comic relief .  The damned thing was supposed to be climactic and seen as the fall of the Gondorian stewards, not as some fireball tumbling off a cliff!  And what else?  Oh, yeah, they're missing the  entire  Scouring of the Shire, Celeborn crosses the Sea, Frodo and Sam act nastily slashy, they downplayed the entire Dernhelm vs. Witchking scene, which pisses the shit out of me because I love Eowyn and I think she's the most awesome character in LotR (except for Glorfindel and Faramir).    Celeborn crosses the fucking sea.  The hell?  He's supposed to stay in Middle Earth, rename Mirkwood with Thranduil, live in Lothlorien, miss his wife, go to Mirkwood, and live with.. Thranduil!  He's not supposed to go on the ship!  And they left Legolas and Gimli in Middle Earth!  Are they implying that they dropped dead after Aragorn became King?  Or that he turned corrupt and started hacking people in half, and that the ship was an attempt to flee the horrible twisted king of Gondor?  Though I will admit, the CG was beautiful in the majority of the scenes.  Gollum was done insanely well, the Eagles were convincing, the Dead were convincing, Minas Morgul was gorgeous, the oliphaunts didn't look pixelated, and... everything was beautiful.  BUT... that stupid scene with Legolas and the oliphaunt very nearly destroyed the entire movie.  Die, Leggy fangirls, die.   I will finish this shortly.  Shortly:   And the people around me were bitches.  What is the point of bringing a fucking three-year old to a PG-13 movie?  Y'know what I say we do?  I say we take the crying little shithole in the second-to-last row and chuck him to the row of brainless Legolas fangirls in the first row.    UTOPIA.

       Mood:  Pissed.  Off.  Music:  "Monochrome ni somariyuki machi de" by Takehito Koyasu as Zazel  Currently:  Bitching.  About.  Everything.  Currently At:  Home  Right, and if that fucking ass "New hardware detected" shit comes up again, I will take a sledgehammer and destroy my computer.  I'm that pissed.  It has something to do with the tests and quizzes today coupled with Animeniacs' failed delivery of my soundtracks.  Do I sound selfish to you?  I'm sorry, do you think I  care ?  I'm seriously close to tears right now, and I will explode if anything else happens.  So, if you have bad news, save it for next year when I'm not so stressed and unwilling to cooperate with any carbon-based life form that contacts me.   GEOMETRY:   First test of the day.  I think I passed, barring the first twenty problems.  Oh yeah...   ENGLISH:  Grammar final.  70 questions.  I think I got.. maybe.. .a 60.   HISTORY:   World War I exam.  It was easy as hell.  Except Farr can't format for shit.  The columns were all off and crap.  It's not like it's  that  hard to use Microsoft Word, moron.   PROGRAMMING:   Goodman, do us all a favor AND SHUT YER BLOODY TRAP.   PE:  Badminton.  And because Charmaine wasn't here,  AGAIN  (She hasn't been in all week.  Am I worried?  Not really.), I had to play iwth David.  Which wasn't actually bad, until we had to play against Louden, who's the freaking most talkative bastard in the universe.   LATIN:  Stage 10 test.  Stupid.   BIOLOGY:   Test on RNA and DNA.  I found a mistake and didn't bother to report it, figuring I could bitch about it later if I got it wrong.  Something about a DNA codon with AGU (AUG?  I forget.)  Anyway, it's the start codon on mRNAs, and couldn't possibly be DNA because DNA doesn't have uracil in it.  Stupid.  Stupid.  Stupid.   Don't even try messing with me today.

      What fun.  Meee just got backed from schoolios.  Well, from Jody's house, where we went after school.  It was okay, considering I'd missed about 70,000 little tidbits of information from all my classes.  Shiznits.  Period 0 - Biology H:  Yay.  Sub today.  She happens to be a pretty good acquaintence of mine...we actually bought out house from her family, and she used to help with the basketball team about 3 years ago at Mesa.  It was fun.  We sat there and didn't do anything.  Watched some weird movie.  You know what?  I watched a movie in every core class today!  Well, not really, but close.  Period 1 - English 1 H:  Like I said.  Movie.  Title: The Human Comedy.  It was weird.  Yeah.  We're supposed to do a movie review thing...too bad I only watched the last damned part....psh.  Period 2 - Ceramics:  What fun.  Sat there the whole damned period fixing my box.  It ended up breaking.  *roar*  Period 3 - Algebra 2 H: Explained my whole little situation to Nicholson.  She agress with me.  Doctors are idiots.  Instaed of movies, we listened to Christmas songs.  Period 4 - Drama: Rehearsed our scenes.  My genius group thought I would be in the hospital forever, so they left me out.  Good.  We get docked 10%, and we still have to gimme a part.  Damn Gina....I mean, she's all like, "Go," and then    we go, and three seconds later she's like, "Wait, we should do [insert her lovely bullshit comments here]."  *roar*  Period 5 - World History H:  Well, um, we watched a movie.  It was really more of a power point, but who cares?  It was about....propaganda.  *woot*  Period 6 - Doctors said I wasn't supposed to play until Monday, but I'm going to play tomorrow....Screw the doctors.  If they couldn't find anything wrong, I'm going to facking play./  *nodnod*

      I'm blogging two days in a row.  That's awesome.  I never do that now.  [ T_T ] I know, I know.  I've become neglecting and evil.  Sorry.   Mood:  Meh.  Music:  "Velvet Underworld" by Weiss Kreuz  Currently:  Typing up the Rurouni Kenshin section  Currently @:  Home  Today wasn't fun.  [whines]  I hate that.  I'm still wearing my glasses because I have an eye infection.  At least I have new glasses. They're silver titanium now, wanna see?  [holds out at computer screen]  And they're pretty!  And the subscription is 800 degrees!  XDDD  I'm almost clinically blind, I know.  Richard told me only ten times this past week.  People seem to take pleasure in taking my glasses and putting them on.  I guess they like migraines?   Geometry:   Oh the boringness.  But Rasch moved me up a seat so now I'm closer to her.  [wrinkles nose]  And I'm surrounded by nastily optimistic people.  Nastily so.  They put on makeup in class and squeal about real life boys.  What's so special about those?  [snort]  Carbon-based life forms...   English:  Library time!  Why must Demeter mate with Zeus?  Why?   History:  We had the most idiotic substitute teacher of all time.  Seriously.  That man had no idea what he was saying, and he looked like a total idiot to boot.  Ass.   FOP:   We had.. NO TIME on the computer, seriously.  Not like I could've done anything, though I did peek at Tiny Tenshi [hits self] to see if it had fallen apart or something.  I do that.  I don't know why.  O.o;;  I'm really, really paranoid about that stuff.  I almost fainted, because it was 11:00, the day had already progressed for 11 hours, and TT had..  six hits .  ...  Look, I'm not even that hit obsessed, and I was scared and frightened.  I don't ever want to go affiliate hunting again; I have bad judgment.

      Jessica's making me blog, so I'm going to.  I'm not in the greatest mood in the world, so... just.. be warned, okay?   Mood:  Bitchy.  One word: PMS  Music:  "Tiny Little Song" by Takehito Koyasu  Random Thought:  Jessica just hung up on me.  Oy.  Currently:  Nuiuuuuuuuu  Currently @:  Home.  Bishounen I've Managed to Steal From Vanessa:   Ran, Kakyou, Yue, Kyou, Yuki, Hatsuharu, Shigure, the rest of the Furuba boys.. XD...  Today was crappy.  It was.  And I have ten Internet Explorer windows open.  Oy.  O_o;;;  I've been reading people's blogs and have concluded that their lives are worse than mine.  I should be happy.  [blink]  Optimistic?  Me?    Been obsessing way too much over Gl&uuml;hen Ran, it's not  healthy .  But it's not my fault.  That boy (man?  assassin? piece of plastic?)  is so gorgeous.  So.  Very.  Gorgeous.

[licks lips]  Yummy.  I swear the thing was animated with crayons, though.  Never watch Disney before Weiss Kreuz.  It is  death  to the eyes.    Anyway, Animeniacs stocked up on wallscrolls.    And somehow, they've ran out of  Saiyuki  ones.  And that was a really bad picture, too.  Hakkai's face is off center.  And Sanzo's is too, but his face is always off center, so it's not like it's anything new.  Goku is, as always, adorable.  I don't know about Gojyo, because I can't  see  Gojyo.

Rasch caught me 'cheating' on the Quick Quiz.  Okay.  I wasn't cheating.  I just had the freaking handout she passed out DURING THE QUIZ on my desk.  Little bitch.  Everyone else had theirs out too.

      MY LIFE SUCKS.    Geez.........I thought I couldn't spell.  Psh.  Yeah.  Just got home from the hospital, gots to stay home tomorrow....I think.  Blah.  OK....for those of you who care.  DON'T EVER LET YOURSELF GET DRAGGD AWAY FROM A ROW 16 VIEW OF A DAMN LAKERS GAME THAT THEY WIN BY 2 POINTS IN THE LAST POSSESSION.  IF THE SURGERY DON'T KILL YOU, THE FRUSTRATION WILL.  OK.  Here we go.  OK.  So it's Sunday night and my dad and I are walking into Staples Center for the game against the Jazz.  Chrsitina rings up my phone, and I talk to her for a lil bit.  Then we find our seats and sit and watch the game.  ROW 16.  YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW DAMN CLOSE THAT IS?  Whatever.  Halftime, we walk around for a bit.  Third quarter.  About 5 minutes left.  Stomach starts to hurt like a motha.  So now Jessica's all PISSED OFF.  I WANTED TO WATCH THE DAMN GAME!  *roar*  So anyhoo, I start shaking like hell, and, according to my dad, I turn all pale and shit.  OK.  So now Jessica's like REALLY REALLY pissed.  Dad makes us leave for the ER. Gosh darn.  I'm shaking like hell, and the Lakers are up by 17.  So we figure, "Aw, what the hell, they're going to blow the Jazz out anyways."  God damn, we were wrong.  Anyhow.  We get to the nearest hopital   and I check into the E.R.  They're just like, "OK."  Then we register and sit in the waiting room for three hours.  No shit.  We seriously sit there.  For three goddamn hours.  I've all bent over clutching my stomach andl, no offense to anyone, but there were all these black people there who were just THERE.  I didn't even see wtf they were doing in the goddamned emergency room. So I finally get checked into a room, and I'm there for another hour or so.  I get a nice little hospital wristband, too.  I'm still wearing it.  Then they tell me they want a damned urine sample.  So I'm just sitting there and I have no goddamn trace of an idea as to how the freak I'm going to get my facking piss in that little container.  Anyway, just know that I did.  Then they tooked a damned blood test.  The needle was crapa thick!  Oh my goshies.  It was in my arm until the hour of my discharge.  Stupid people.  They hook it up to an IV.  Then they decide the stupid urine sample was illegitimate, because apparently it don't work if you're on your period...*ROAR*  So they did it another way.  OMFG.  You don't wanna know.  Seriously.  Just......believe me.  It hurt like a motha, though. Then a bunch of doctors come in, one at a time, and after about 2 hours or so they decide I need immediate surgery for appendicitis.  So it's about 2 in the morning right now.  Then they come in and tell me it can wait until around 5.  So I'm lying on the damn bed in the hallway for the next three hours.  So then this one guy comes and takes me up to the fifth floor to take a CAT scan and shit.  Man, it was boring.  I just sat there listening to a damn tape recording going, "Take a deep breath and hold it."  5 seconds later...."You may breathe."  So I'm thinking, "I'll breathe whenever the hell I want."  Anyhow, they said they were going to look at the scan and THEN decide if they were going to facking operate.  So now it's around 6 in the morning, my dad and I hadn't gotten ANY sleep, and at this point we're just like, "Well, screw that." Apparently, they decided I didn't NEED surgery, and they pulled me up to the pediatric center.  Oh yes.  Pediatrics.  In the morning this lady comes up and tells me about what the surgery will be like....and she talked like I was 5.  "Here's the brain....do you know what it does?...................Here's the digestive system...do you know what it does?  What does it do?  VERY GOOD!.............This is the respiratory system...."  Man, I was bored.  Yeah.  So I studied the damned appendix for an hour....IT DON'T DO ANYTHING!  My God. Then a bunch of doctors just start rolling in.  Oh yeah, my mom took over for my dad.  They came in and they just kept pushing the same spot on my stomach and asking me if there was pain.  They took my temperature about 40,000 times, blood pressure about 70,000 times.  They schedule the damned surgery for 8:00 P.M.  So I take a little nap...stupid PEOPLE DON'T LEMME SLEEP!  *roar* And then 8 rolls around and they're like, "OK, we can wait until 9."  9 rolls around and I'm all hyped up for surgery and.........................they said surgery wouldn't be necessary.  So now I'm just like, "OK, MAKE UP YOUR GODDAMN MIND!"  Whatever.  So apparently they kept taking blood tests to count the white blood cells (if it was appendicitis, the white cell count was supposed to be high or something.  I just died.  I mean, I zonked out.  I didn't give a shit anymore.   This morning rolls around, and the surgeon guy comes in and says I need surgery.  Now, the whole night they were saying that if  I didn't completely break down over night, I could leave in the morning.  So I didn't die overnight.  My mom was just like, "WTF?!?!?!"  I gave up.   Seriously.  I didn't give a damn anymore.  So basically....my day in a nutshell: "Sat there, made sure I didn't NEED surgery, ate the NASTIEST FOOD I HAVE EVER EATEN IN MY LIFE, and came home.  Shit.  OK.  *nonchalantly* That was my day......so how was yours?

      Oiiiiiiii.  Just got back from Knott's Berry Farm.  We wented to celebrate the birthday of my sad ickle excuse for a brother.  Bull.  He invited four ickle "friends" to come with.  My god.  So there were five of the ickle tykes.  One wouldn't go on the one Timberland roller coaster....the one in CAMP SNOOPY.  THE GREEN ONE.  He went on....um....ONE ride today.  *drumroll* THE SWINGS!!!  My poor mum.  She loves roller coasters as much as me does, and she didn't get to go on a SINGLE ONE because she had to watch the kid.   Another one is a big pain in the ass who thinks he knows everything.  Idiots waddles and walks slow.  Another one is just......idiosyncractic.  Yes.  Bloody hell.  The other one's OK, save for the fact that he got carsick on the way over.......NOT pretty.  The last is my brother.  Enough said.  And now the dorks are outside, playing with MY Nintendo system.  Hey, Elfie, for my b-day, Mummy said I could get about 3 friends and stay until we got tired....then she'd come and pick us up.  Think she wants to come with, though.  XDDD

      Hn.  I'm reading X fanfiction.  Again.  Eh.  Stupid people making Sorata gay. On with the show.     Period 0 - Geometry  Aw, bloody hell.  This class is *still* nothing.  Meh, Jessica.  I want your Algebra II class.  [pouts]  Then again, if all your problems are as bitchy as the one you showed me.. maybe not.  Hm.  Is the kid sitting diagonally from me in this class male or female?  I can't tell.   Period 1 - Digital Electronics  I have.. a LAB PARTNER.  [ominous music plays]  Though An is perfectly fine, I'd really rather have Ran.  [evil snicker]  Then I'd kidnap him and ... yeah.  :P  But, he's not REAL, so I guess I'll just sit here and wallow in self-pity.  Oh, WHY can't they be real?  [tears hair out]  We got our spiffy books today.  Spif-fy.  I sit in the far corner of the class.  It figures.  What is  with  teachers and alphabetical order?  Pshaw.   Period 2 - Geography/Nonwestern Cultures IB  Ah well, back to the monotony.  We spent the *entire* class listening to Ms. Farr talk.  Whoop-de-freaking-doo.   Period 3 - Biology  We took a TEST.  Yes, boysies and girlsies, a  BIOLOGY TEST .  On the SECOND DAY of the semester.  Dude, it was harder than the final.  >.>;   Period 4 - PE  TRACK SEASON!  Ima gonna DIE.  We're going to do long jumps, and we were practicing, and I smartmouthed this guy for telling me to jump farther.  Yeah.   Period 5 - Latin  [snooze]  Constitutum Caesarium.. something.  I know I spelled the second one incorrectly but my Latin binder is downstairs and I'm far too lazy to go down and get it.  So, yeah.  Worked with Jessie on Caecilius' death story and listened to Ryan bitch about Ms. Kline.   Period 6 - English  T______________________________________T  Yes, there was a reason I had a vaguely suicidal expression on my face in this class.  No, I am not telling you why.

      Y'all think YOU had a nice, lovely day on your second semester start.  Lemme tell you, you are soon to be beaten!  Let's see.  I think I'll do a play-by-play kinda thing....^_^.  Wow that looks like he has a PIMPLE on his cheek.  ^_^   6:25 A.M.:  Daddy's talking to me in the car about ball-point pens.  I was writing on a piece of paper with one on the car window.  He asked if it was working.  I said yeah.  He was like, "You wanna hear something about your lovely NASA corporation?"  Stupid me, I bit.  "Ball point pen only work with gravtiy.  Your NASA went and spent 2 million dollars devising a pen that could write in outer space, in anti-gravity.  Whoop-de-freaking-doo, it worked.  Now you see, there are these Russian people.  They're quite smart.  So smart, in fact, that they saved 3 years and 2 million dollars.  They mandated that everyone used PENCILS up in outer space."  >.   6:30 A.M.:  I arrive in the Snakteria (just hearing the name makes me wanna hurl) to pick up my schedule.  They don't open the window until about 6:40.  During this time, I sit and tell Chicken my dad's lovely pen joke.  Then the windows open and we separate to get our schedules.   6:45 A.M.:  The Platypus realizes that she has only been given ONE class: 4th period -- Introduction to Drama.  OK.  So then the Platypus, poor, ickle, confused freshman that she is, wanders up to her zero period in utter shock.  Mr. Adams tells the poor platypus that she's gotta go get it fixed up in Guidance.  He kicks her outta the room, saying the class doesn't appear on her pink slip.  HELLO!  YOU DON'T THINK I  KNOW  THAT?  I'M MISSING 6 CLASSES, NUMBSKULL!  Anyhow.  The Platypus leaves the room.   6:53 A.M.:  I arrive in Guidance.  Tiny problem.  Um....the counselors don't GET there until 7:30.  Now, any of you out there who are worth your salt will have figured out I was about 35 minutes too early. So.  I walk around and visit all my little friends for the next 40 GODDAMNED MINUTES.  Mind you, all this before 7 A.M.   7:35 A.M.:  Arrive in office once again.  The really nice secretary lady looks at my schedule and she's like, "WOW!  I wish someone told ME I only had to be here for an hour!"  Then she pulled up my schedule and printed it out.  Then the whole office goes crazy.  Apparently, someone was printing out ALL the class rosters for second semester, which I thoguht was a real pity; they're all f***ed up anyhow.  So she doesn't know that and puts in that special pink paper.  Then whoop-de-doo out comes the class roster.  She gets all mad (again, this is a really really really nice, elderly lady) and scrunches it up and throws it away, only to later be told by any secretary that they'll be short that one roster.  ^_^  Then they come to the conclusion that they've been robbed; there's no more paper in ANY of the machines!  All in all, it was quite a kick in the pants.   7:40 A.M.:  Sprint to zero hoping to catch Adams before he leaves for the staff meeting; energy was wasted in that attempt; the turtle was still drinking coffee *zing in the head*.  I pick up my stuff and head downstairs, chilling for the next hour.  It's late start Monday!  Anyhow.  I eat those lovely sausage bite things.  I've called them something wrong both times now.  First I called them mini-corn dogs, and today, I called them TATER-TOTS.  What do you WANT from me?  I'm JUST TRYING TO GET BREAKFAST, OK?   9:00 A.M.:  Headed up to first period with Dahlberg.  The whole class badgered him for grades.  I got a 96% on the final exam and a 97% as a semester grade.  If only I had done that well in ANY of my other classes.  We were buggin him SO MUCH, all we did was go over the MUG shot on the board.  No, it wasn't a picture.  It's kinda like D.O.L.  I told you, Elfie, I ain't good with acronyms.  *GA-PAW!*   9:52 A.M.:  Ceramics; video bulletin.  WOOT!  TABOR GOT MARRIED!  HELL YEAH.  Chic was kinda fat, though.  XD  Yeah.  They disgraced the athletics.  Every damn team is winless in EVERY sport, with the exception of water polo.  POLO?!?!?!?!? OK.  Of course, this is only varsity; JV's are doing pretty well....I think.  I HAVE AN A IN THIS CLASS, BABY!  DON'T WORRY, IT ONLY GOES DOWNHILL FROM HERE.   10:54 A.M.:  Algebra 2.  Hell.  Don't even GET ME STARTED.  I AM BACK WITH A VENGEANCE THIS SEMESTER.  MUST AVENGE MY GRADE.  *shudders* So close, I tell you.  So CLOSE!  HATE HATE HATE.  We were GOING to have new POW groups, and consequently, new seats, but this one soph dropped the class.  LOL.  THe groups were all messed up.  hehehe.  nicholson had a fit.  XD   11:46 A.M.:  Drama.  Yay.  95.1% in the class, baby!  HELL YEAH!  Well.  We did improv the whole time.  Was quite fun, actually.  I didn't have to go up *hint hint*.   12:32 P.M.:  Lunch!!!  Me and the monkey decided to go and get salad from Christina's mom.  Hehehe.  She gave me a LOT!  Whoa.  I swear, I didn't finish it.  XD   1:17 P.M.:  World Hist.  Ok.  I HAVE AN A!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WOOT!  HELL YEAH.  ANyhow.  We watched this really really broing documentary.  Well.  see, first semester, we passed eveyrthing to the  left.  NOW, WE'RE PASSING IT ALL TO THE RIGHT!   NO!!!!!!!!!!!  I'M IN THE RIGHT COLUMN!!!!!!!  I HAVE TO  COLLECT  STUFF!  Anyhow.   2:09 P.M.:  Reported to Tabor for Basketball.  We were outta there in two seconds.  Tiff, on the other hand, had to go and get her thing signed by the track people.  Then they had a "meeting."  Grrrrrrrr.  I would've been home an hour earlier....but it's alright.  I'm cool like that.    OK.  My basic over-view of grades....   Biology H -- B+ [4 points for my ga-paw] English 1H -- A [5 points for my ga-paw] Ceramics -- A [4 points for my ga-paw] Algebra 2H -- B+ [4 points for my ga-paw] Drama -- A [4 points for my ga-paw] World History H -- A [5 points for my ga-paw] Basketball -- A [4 points for my ga-paw] Golf -- A [4 points for my ga-paw]  SEMESTER GPA:   With Golf -- 4.25 Without Golf -- 4.29  I say with or without golf....I dunno if it's going to count.  It counted last time....dunno.    Bejesus.  I'm TIRED.

      Jessica, I owe you this.  This blog entry's gonna be a ten-page dissertation, just you wait and see.    Today was the first day of the second semester, which means I got utterly confused on the way to class.  >.>;  I am such a pathetic little idiot.  And my schedule bloody  sucks .  So, watch me RAMBLE.   Oh, and they gave us more homework on this day alone then they did all last semester, I swear.    Period 0 - Honors Geometry - Rasch   Yep.  I still have this little witch, and she's still one boring little witch.  Piece of.  Okay, let's see.  I sit next to the chalkboard, therefore I inhale chalk dust through the hour of horror that is zero period.  Plus, I'm almost right in front of the white board, so I also get nice long whiffs of  dry erase marker .  Isn't that lovely?  I've always wanted to lose all my brain cells before being old enough to babysit.    And, if you'll believe this luck, I have to sit behind, of all people, NELSON.  What kind of bullshit is that?  Of all people.  Of EVERY BLOODY PERSON IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING PERIOD, Nelson.  Shit, I  hate  this class.  It's here to torture me.  I swear it.    Period 1 - Digital Electronics - Allen   No, girlsies and boysies, don't be fooled by the &uuml;ber spiffy name of the class.  This class was once called  ICT .  Y'know,  I ncredibly  C ruel  T orture.  Allen said that himself, mind you.  The big long nasty name is  Computer Logic and Algorithms .  Lord help me.  Spent the entire craptastic period listening to course objectives and bad jokes about the stupidity of Scummy Hills and Fairmont.   "Yeah, see, he's going to grade your labs like someone from Scummy [Sunny] Hills.  Which means he will know  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ."     "See, this is Troy.  We expect something from you.  At Fullerton, you can just write anything and they'll think you're a genius.  At Sunny Hills, well... you get SOME right, I mean they're not  completely  stupid, are they. "  [Class boos]     Period 2 - Geography/Nonwestern Cultures IB   Oh my god, I STILL have this period.  -_-"  I feel so sorry for Rachel.  [snickers]  I nearly died laughing when I saw the seating chart.  Poor Rachel.  [snickersnickersnicker]  We spent the class period listening to Chinese folk music and doing outlines for Buddhism, Daoism, Laoism, and Confucianism.  As expected, Farr pronounced everything wrong.  And, as expected, people made snide remarks about the music.  I'm not a fan of Chinese folk myself, but can't they respect the culture?  So what if it's a bit different and more centered on violins than electric guitars?  It's not like heavy metal is any better.  "BOO HOO BANG I'M GONNA KILL YOU YOU SON OF A BITCH.."  Oh, yeah.   Reaaaal  intelligent.      Period 3 - Biology IB - Kirkpatrick   Oo, I have Mr. K!  Mr. K!  Mr. K!  Shit.  I want Mrs. Hall.  I don't CARE that she stole my name, she's not HALF as boring as he is.  Bloody hell.  I sit smack in the middle of the classroom.  Therefore, I cannot sleep.    Period 4 - PE - Homer   I forgot to dress out.  Bah.  It was fun watching everyone else suffer, though.  Westbrook's class  still  sucks.  None of them can do pushups for shit.  And all their leg lifts were totally off.  So amusing.      Period 5 - Latin - Kline   I managed to scrape a 95.76 in this class,  even though  I forgot to turn in my notebook, which was worth 50 points.  I am very amused.  It shows exactly how idiotic this class is.  So utterly pointless, Latin I.  I'm probably going to die next year, though.  We chose groups for the rest of the semester, and I'm pretty happy with all of them except one.  I don't know Monica OR Clara and Clara looks like a stereotypical Asian slutty prep.  We'll see how this goes.    Period 6 - English - Lewis      I AM NOT AMUSED.      The counselors hate me.  The world hates me.  This class hates me.  I hate this class.  Woo, mutual feelings, how adorable.  Fuck.  She's implementing a seating chart tomorrow, which means I run the risk of sitting within a six meter radius of Daniel.  By the way, if you're reading this, fuck off.  Seriously.  Stay away from me.  FAR away.  You're (1) moronic, (2) utterly brainless, (3) perverted, and (4) JUST PLAIN SCREWED UP.  You are, quite possibly,  worse than George .  You heard me.  Worse than George.  Damn it, I only don't hate two people in this class:  Jessie and Richard.  Jessie because I talk to her in Latin, and Richard because he was in first period English last semester, is nicer than most people, and doesn't bug the shit out of me.  Thanks, guys.  You two rock.  Anyway, there goes bombing NJROTC...   Okay, and here's my homework: Assignment [Period number]      Math problems from the book that I'm too lazy to write out [0]  Weekly problems (Math), set one [0]  Signatures [1]  Buddhism outline  [2]  Reading  [2]  Section Review  [2]  Study guide  [3]  Signatures [3]  Translation worksheet [5]   Lord of the Flies  anticipation guide [6]  Interpreting Kholberg's theory of moral development  [6]    Happy birthday to me...   And no, it's not my birthday.

      OK.  Get your asses ready for the most pissed off rant I have EVER made.  Most of the people who know me think I'm mostly jolly-ful.  NOW I'M THE MOST PISSED OFF I WILL EVER BE AT SOMEBODY I'VE ONLY SEEN FOR AN HOUR.    OK.  So we went and played Garey High SChool in Pomona.  I AM PISSED.  I TALKED SHIT THE WHOLE FUCKING GAME.  THOSE BITCHES.  MOST OF THE PEOPLE ON THE TEAM ARE ASIAN, AND ALL THEM BITCHES WERE MEXICAN.  SO ONE OF THEM WAS LIKE, "oOoOoOoo....LOOK, CHINATOWN BROKE LOOSE."  SO WE WERE LIKE, "OoOOOoOOOOooooo.....JAIL BROKE LOOSE."  I HATE THEM.  I HATE THEM.  WE WERE TALKING SMACK ALL DAMN GAME.  FUCK.  SO ONE OF THE GIRLS THREW UP SOME CRAZY SHOT, AND I WAS LIKE, "AHAHHAHAHAHAHA, NO!"  AND THE GAREY GIRL STANDING NEXT TO ME WAS LIKE, "WHAT'D YOU SAY?"  AND I WAS LIKE, "I SAID NO.  SEE, IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF YES.  NO.  N-O, NO.  Y-E-S, YES.  OH SHIT, SORRY, AM I GOING TOO DAMN FAST FOR YOU?  HAVE YOU LEARNED TO SPELL YET?  IF I'M GOING TOO FAST, JUST LET ME KNOW, AND I'LL BE SURE TO BRING IT DOWN A NOTCH.  SEE, I'M JUST NOT SURE HOW FAST MEXICANS ARE ON THE UPTAKE."  AT WHICH POINT WAR STARTED.  TOWARDS THE END, ONE OF MY TEAMMATES, BECCA, DROVE TO THE BASKET AND SOME GAREY GIRL WAS CALLED FOR THE FOUL.  SHE WAS ALL PISSED, SO SHE KICKED BECCA.  AND THEN SHE GOT A FUCKING TECH.  SO OUR GIRL WAS OUT THERE SHOOTING THE FREE THROWS, AND ME AND SOME OTHER GIRL WERE JAWING IT OUT.  BECCA COMES AND STEPS IN-BETWEEN US, AND THE OTHER GIRL WAS LIKE, "AWWW.....HOW CUTE; THE BUDDY SYSTEM?"  AND BECCA, KICK ASS, SHE WAS LIKE, "YUP.  WE ALL LOVE THE BUDDY SYSTEM."  WHICH SHUT THE BASTARD UP GOOD.  AND THEN SO I'M TRYING TO POP THE BALL FROM ONE OF THE PLAYERS, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "GIRL, YOU TRYING TOO HARD."  AND I WAS LIKE, "OH.  MAYBE YOU SHOULD TRY HARDER, SEEING AS YOU'RE DOWN BY 20 POINTS!!!"  THOSE BITCHES.  I SWEAR.  AND THEN I WAS ALL PUMPED UP THE FOURTH QUARTER.  I GET FOULED AND SHE LANDS ON MY FOOT.  I FEEL IT ROLL.  THEN SHE GETS UP AND  KICKS  IT.  MY FUCKING GOD.  SO IT'S THE END OF THE GAME, AND OUR COACH WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO START  ANYTHING .  YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEFEND YOURSELVES, BUT YOU ARE NOT THE INSTIGATE ANYTHING."  SO I WALK BY THE BITCH, AND SHE'S LIKE, "OoOOoooOOoO...CRY ME A RIVER."  SO ONE OF MY TEAMMATES WAS LIKE, "WOW, HOW'D YOU KNOW?  I LIKE J. TIMBERLAKE, TOO."  THOSE BITCHES.  I'M JUST SAYING.  WHEN TO PLAY US AT WILSON, THEY BETTER WATCH THEIR ASSES.  FUCK YEAH.

      Shitfuckdamnhellbloodysonofabitch. I'm having a GOOD DAY, are you?  Okay, so my mom's letting me get a new domain, but someone that really hates me just joined TFL.org's Anime & Manga staff.  Which means I'm probably not going to get approved for shit.  Isn't that great?  Just spiffy, isn't it.  Maybe I should create an alter identity.  Maybe I should cease to be so fucking hateable.  Or, actually, maybe that little ass that just joined the staff should stop hating people so easily?  Whatever.  If you're reading this, I'm probably just randomly venting my anger out at you because it has nowhere else to go.  And I have no clue why I'm so uptight.  Three days and then it's back to hell.  When does the craziness end?   I'm not going to elaborate; this day doesn't deserve that...

      Well.  I must say.  My life right now can be summarized in two profane words: FUCKING BULLSHIT.  I mean Jesus Christ really.  O.o Speaking of....will tell later.  OK.  My week in a nutshell.  Mind you, this will be hella condensed.  Just imagine it about 10 times worse.   Biology H -- Period 0:  I hate this class.  I can't remember what we did earlier in the week.  So yesterday.  We have this one guy...Mr. MacSomething....he's one of those people trying to get a credential...so he's asking Adams to "show him the ropes."  Whatever.  So yesterday, he gives his first lecture.  His voice....no projection.  I swear.  I sit in the front row.  God I couldn't hear SHIT.  But at least he doesn't eat chalk like Adams.  Have I ever told y'all about that?  Adams writes with chalk then licks his fingers....SICK.  AND the rag he uses to wipe off the overhead.  I swear.  you would think the guy would use water.  No.  He licks it.  Right after he wipes the chalkboard with the very same rag.  SO the whole class is trying to be real nice.  I swear, I thought the class was REALLY REALLY REALLY good behaviorally.  Mr. Mac looked like a nervous train wreck just waiting to happen.  He was REALLY nervous.  No offense to the guy, but, uh, Biology is hard enough.   English 1H -- Period 1:  oOo I love this class.  Nothing much.  Just reading "And Then There Were None."  I LOVE THIS CLASS.  PROBABLY MY FAVORITE CLASS.   Ceramics -- Period 2:  Just learned today that we have FINALS for CERAMICS.  RIGHT.  NOW I'M ALL STRESSED OUT.  AGAIN.  I CAN'T FAIL CERAMICS!!!!   Algebra 2H -- Period 3:  Now this class I will fail regardless of what the hell I try to do.  I had to make up a test yesterday during 6th period right before my game started.  LOL.  I was dressed in my jersey and warm-ups and everything and I was sitting there taking a math test.  HA.  XDDD.  This class.  C or better.  I'm hoping.     Drama -- Period 4:  Monologue.  HOLY SHIT I HAD TO BE A REVEREND.  HEY ELFIE, CHRISTIANS ARE TAKING OVER, I SWEAR TO....WELL.....GOD.  Yes, I swear to myself soemtimes.  I deliver a goddamn eulogy.  Wanna hear it?  Here it is...well, what I remember.  The script's upstairs, and quite frankly, I don't care if i miss a bunch of shit.  "Yes, we're ready with the Judge Buckner eulogy....I'll tell you what, Arles, you just set her up right back there, and when we're ready, just wave your hand......you're ready?  OK.  This is the Revernd Spikes, and I just wanna say a few words, a few words about a friend of mine and a friend of Tuna's.  Roscoe (what kinda f***ed up name is that?) Buckner (again, wtf?) spent his entire life in service to his community, his country, and his Lord.  And we're sure when the role is called up yonder, he'll be there (?).  He was a judge who made hay while the sun shined(........) and used his smile as an umbrella.  He kept his sunny side up and saw the silver lining of every cloud.  He took no wooden nickels nor threw caution to the wind, but looked before he leapt and never got in over his head.  No, he kept his head, when others around him were losing theirs and blaming it on him.  About this man we can truly say, he was a jolly good fellow, which no one can deny.  He was one for all and all for one.  And I tell you this, he did it HIS way.  He was a serious-minded judge who let bygones be bygones but always remembered the Alamo.  About this man we could truly say, he was the cream of Tuna's coffee. (That's about half....the other half I'm skipping.  It's just a bunch more bullshit).....It's hard to find words to describe a man like this, but I've done my best.  We commend him, Lord.  I, the Reverend Spikes, recommend him.  Amen, Lord, Amen."  Then the guy realizes that the cord wasn't plugged in right and I have to do it OVER AGAIN.  That was bullshit.  Anyhow.  Fun.  Boring, boring monologues.   World History H -- Period 5:  Good god.  History Day is a bitch.  Banquet yesterday.  Like I placed.  Stefanie Wong and Laura higashi took first for group exhibits!!!  County, babeeee!  Hell yeah.  Anyhow.  I got back from the banquet at 9:00 P.M.  Was up until 1 in the morning making a damned notecard for this class....my make-up test.  I tooked it during lunch today!   Pooooooooop.   Basketball -- Period 6:  I HATE ADRIAN.  There.  Said it.  but that's okay.  I'm not alone.  i mean, NOBODY likes her.  grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  Just so....Grrrrrr.  Can't explain it here.

      This.  Is.  Fucking.  Bullshit.  I swear, Murphy's Law was working full force today because it just  sucked .  I haven't checked if my domain is down, but if it is... there'll be hell to pay.  I'm not in a good mood, I'm pissed at everyone (well, almost), and I'm about to explode, so it might be nice if you stay away, okay?  Far, far away.   Mood:  Fucked.  Up.  Music:  "Sotsugyou" - Tackey and Tsubasa  Okay, so first I overslept (woke up at 6:10) and so I was fucking pissed because I had to get ready a lot faster than usual.  I barely ate anything for breakfast, which normally has to sustain me from six to one, but since I didn't *get* breakfast, I was starving.  Zero period.  Rasch wouldn't shut her fucking trap, so I had to listen to her jabber the entire time.  I swear, if I hear the words "TRIANGLE,"  "ANGLE," "SIMILARITY," and "PROOF" in the same sentence  one more time  I will go bonkers.  First period.  I'm sorry, James, but you cannot present for shit and I don't admire your oral skills in any which way.  Or your Photoshop skills, for that matter.  Your PowerPoint background was pitiful.  What was it?  Difference clouds with blue and cyan blended into a dark blue background, lens flare, distort, filter: hard light?  Yes, it was that obvious.  And thank you, Caitlin, for telling him to buzz off about German rice because I was in no mood to talk back.  Second period.  Hitler.  Oh shit, if he weren't dead I'd've killed him.  And anyone who thinks they know everything about WWII, because you don't look smart, you're a fucking pain the ass.  Third period.  Was fun.  The adventures of Bob, oh yeah.  Dionne, I'm sorry, but the best I can do today-- oh wait.. [checks through Start programs]  THIS COMPUTER HAS ADOBE PHOTOSHOP!  O_O  Albeit an *illegal* copy of Photoshop with no brushes.. but.. Photoshop.. [licks lips]  Okay, my day is a little bit better.  Fourth period.  Was STUPID.  God, and I thought Charmaine couldn't serve.  She can't hit the ball, either, so we only won once, and that was because Tiffany can't serve either.  Fifth period.  Is Latin ever fun?  Tell me the truth.  Ryan was depressed as hell, and I swear the poor baby had a headache coupled with severe male PMS.  And Kline was as super-happy as ever, which pissed the shit out of everyone in the back row... no, wait, just me and Ryan.  Sixth period.  Biology.  We started talking about evolution, then Hall started going on about a *higher power.*  Fuck, it was like Mears revisited: "Whenever I see a TREE, I can't help but think there's someone OUT THERE controlling things!"  Bullshit.  Full-fledged atheism right now.  I'm listening to music and if the Weiss boys mention "kami" I will fucking blow my top.  Takehito Koyasu is my hero even though he seems pretty Christian.  >.>  And if I read somewhere that he *is* Christian... then... I'll follow in my own fucking footsteps.  So I run out of bio to escape Caitlin (sorry, but if you talked to me I would've punched you in the face) and then I had to face super genki mother, which pissed me off greatly.  And so I got home, wasted an hour of my life on geometry and Latin homework, then went upstairs to my COMPUTER.  Which, once I turned on, gave me a fucking error message.  So I turn on my Dad's fucking computer, and the damned thing takes *forever* to start up!  And then IE is  in Chinese encoding, so all ALT codes look run over by something and the default font is ugly as fuck.  I changed the encoding and am now ranting into this blog.  It could be worse; Tiny Little Song seven times in succession has calmed me somewhat.

      Yesterday was.........different.  Yes.  That's the word I'm looking for, I suppose.    8:30 - 10:30: Mental math class.  Ooo, that Indian kid pisses me off.  Doesn't  SHUDDUP for a SECOND.  Oiii.  I suppose that's what I was like when I was four.  Wait....there are quite a few people out there who STILL think I'm loud, huh?  Oh yeah.  Saw quite a few of those today.  XDDDDD.  11:30 - 1:30: Went to the orthodontist's.  The wire was too long and kept cutting into my mouth.  Oiii.  So I sit there for an HOUR in the damned waiting room.  Then I FINALLY get called in.  So I wait in the chair for ten MORE minutes.  Someone FINALLY comes in and chops off the extra wire.  There.  Took what?  30 seconds including the time it took for the assistant lady to get her gloves on?  Shit I didn't even SEE the orthodontist today.  Damn, the mother was PISSSSSED.  1:45 - 2:25: Went to pick up Laura from her house to "rehearse" for the scene....which, of course, is scheduled for Wednesday.  Crappit.  We didn't do ANYTHING.  We were too busy trying to pump up my ball.  XDDD  Took FOREVER.  The needle that I got from Mrs. Higashi didn't even fit.  Oiii.  So I had to hold the needle in place with the pump head right on top of that.  We actually filled in 3/4 of the WHOLE THING!  It actually bounced when we dropped it!  You don't understand!  The ball didn't bounce yesterday when I dropped it on the floor.  Oiii.  Anyhow.  Ate a hamburger, saved Jody some fries for lunch, and then took off for La Serna.  2:35 - 5:00: So when we got there, Salena and Michelle were already there.  Jody was right behind us.  So I give Nemo my socks and she puts 'em on.  Then we start shooting around for a while.  We were all wearing the same thing!  It was awesome!  Of course, Squirt forgot to call Fishsticks, so she was wearing red shorts.  Oh well.  Too bad.  It was awesome!  So Trisha walks in at about 2:50, and the first thing she asks, "What's up with the socks?"  So I had to tell her we were wearing 'em because we knew Stacey and Daphne didn't like them.  She called us little jerks.  So we started shooting around before practice started.  I HATE JODY'S BALL!  I've jammed three fingers up to date because of her ball!  Shit.  Oh well, it was fun.  So Stacey shows up around 3....such dedication.  Hahaha.  Oh yes.  She said we were color-coordinated.  *grins proudly*  So there were THREE teams there today sharing the court.  So we had a fourth of the court.  It was crap.  We did ball-handling.  CROSSOVERS.  HAHAHA.  WE SUCKED.  And, as a result, we ended up having to do Sweet Sixteens.  Oiiiii.  I was starting to feel that hamburger.  MOOOO.  Then we CONTINUED doing crossovers.  Then we shot.  Oiiiiiii.  Don't even start it.  The shots looked like SHIT.  Seriously.  Salena's the only one who can shoot.  Hahahaha.  Then we did this sliding thing.  It was............new.  Yeah.  We were in the key, sliding back and forth and back and forth.  It was actually really easy.  But SHHHHHHHHHH don't tell 'em that.  Then we got the half-court time.  Since there were three teams, one of 'em got half the court, and if you ran it sideways, you'd have a full court.  WE HAD TO DO CRAZY EIGHTS!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *sniffle*  Then we did the 3-man weave.  Hahahaha.  I missed the lay-up, so we had to do it again.  Then Gurgle missed the lay-up, and we had to do it AGAIN.  Hahahah.  I made it the second time, though.  I know, I know, what awesome skill I have.  We did 3-on-2 next.  It was crap.  I was in the middle more than Laura was.  Stupid Squirt.  Man, I was TIRED.  Hahaha there was this one where I was running in front of the defense down the court, so Daphne was on my team and chucked it up the court for me.  They all wanted me to take the layup, so I threw it back to Daphne.  It was AWESOME.  Sorry, it'd be funnier if you knew what Laura and I were talking about right before that play.  Anyhow.  We did boxing out next.  STUPID GREG.  The munch.  The defense was supposed to box out, and Stacey told Greg to watch and make sure everyone was boxing out.  Stupid Greg.  I DID box out!  You munchkinface.  So we ended up doing even MORE pushups.  Crappit.  I think we did about a hundred and fifty thousand today.  Blah.  Then we ran through plays.  Hahaha.  Jody got a cramp right during the play and the Connie had to help her pull her foot towards she becauswe JODY CAN'T TOUCH HER TOES!  HAHAHA.  Yeah.  So we stopped right there.  Awesome.  Hahahahaha.  Then Daphne wanted to know how Nemo got her sn.  She THOUGHT IT WAS ME!  Geeeeeeeeez.  WHY DOES SHE ALWAYS THINK I'M THE INSTIGATOR OF EVERYTHING?!?!?!?  Hahaha.  Anyhow.  It was awesome.  Daphne was swinging her keys around and then she just absent-mindedly let go.  Hahaha.  All of a sudden you hear, "Hey, where'd my keys go?!?!?"  LOL.  It was crappa funny.  Fishsticks threw them to me and I tried to throw them to Nemo, but Daphne caught 'em.  Poopers.   5:30 - 8:30: Went with Squirt and Mrs. Higashi to the SOC banquet.  We helped pass out bags and raffle tickets.  OMG LAURA WON THREE TIMES!  Two?  Three?  Whatever.  Jody won twice, and JAIMIE won a pair of tickets to Six Flags.  GEEEEZ.  I didn't win anything *sniffle*.  Laughed at Greg for a while......Then it was over and I walked back to Jody's house with them, since she lives RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET.  Yeah.  Then my mommy camed.    Oiiii.  Wilson Awards Banquet in about two hours...nobody from SOC'll be able to move......shiite.

       NO!  It's HERE!  We're all DEAD.  DIED.  Blowed-up.  Ka-blooey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Well now.  In case you haven't already figured it out, Saturday is tomorrow.  AND YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!!!!!!!  Everyone knows what that means.  So.  I shall run through the last day of my life.    Period 0 -- Biology H: Worms!  Awesome!  HAHAHAHAHA.  The guys in our class are ALL WIMPS.  lol.  Sorry guys, but you are.  Seriously.  The only one in our class wimpier than you guys was the Chicken.  Oii.  I would hope so.  She DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH IT!  LOL.  Anyhow.  It was awesome.  We couldn't open the jar.  Then he goes around distributing worms.  OMG.  I just realized.  HE DIDN'T WASH HIS HANDS!!!!!!  EWWWWWW.  So when he went to flip the pages in the book and he licked his fingers........EWWWWWWWW!  OMG!!!!!  EWWWWWWWW.  Period 1 -- English 1H: Watched "The Alphabet Murders" by Agatha Christie.  I didn't get it.   Phoo monkeys.  Period 2 -- Ceramics: Running outta time.  Uh oh.  Going to fail.  Crap.  Period 3 -- Algebra 2H: Test.  I think I did OK.  It wasn't too bad.  Period 4 -- Drama: Boles was showing the senior projects, so we went to Mackintosh's class.  Oiii.  The pooooooper.  Anyhow.  We "rehearsed" for 20 minutes, then we played Taboo.  Hahaha no one was paying attention.  It was awesome.  Lunch: Blah.  Bought lunch.  Then we walked around.  I SPUNNED AROUND WITH QQ!  Hahaha.  She's still dizzy.  Period 5 -- World History H: Watched the movie again.  Joseph Stalin.  Lovely.  Thick Russian accents.  Like I can figure out what they're trying to teach me even WITHOUT the LOUD MUSIC IN THE BACKGROUND.  After School: Lala.  Stef's mom tooked her home, so Jody and I walked.  Jody walked to HER house and I walked back to MY house.  Oiii.  I could've sworn SHE pulled up by me and laughed at me before driving off.  That's just me, though.  Anyhow.  Then I went to Mesa, assuming my brother's game was at Mesa.  But NO.  It was one of their rare away games.  Damn.  Okay.  A few parting words.  I LOVE YOU ALL.  Hhaha.  For those of you who think I shall be leaving you something, check with QQ, my hired-fired-rehired-refired lawyer.  Hhaha.  It's been nice knowing you all............. ~The Idiosyncractic Platypus

      I saw a really disturbing license plate on the way to school.   5EXU669 .  Go figure.  It follows the CA license plate pattern too.   I really hope it wasn't intentional.    [laughs]  Anyhow...   Geometry  You have no idea how happy I am.  I ACED A GEOMETRY QUIZ.  BOO-YAH.  The first one all year.  XDDDD  I've only aced one quiz.  Isn't that pathetic?  Yeah, I think so too.  >>;  I hate this class.  T_________T  y  ICT  Allen is the most awesome teacher ever.  At least, he's the only one who insists that Bush sucks.  And doesn't crack lame jokes about dishwashers and laugh at himself.  Errrr...   NWC  COUNSELORS!  Yeah, sophomore counseling.  Guess what I'm taking next year?  (Providing I get at least straight B's)    Latin 2  AP European History  Chemistry IB  Honors Algebra II  PE  AP Computer Science  English 2 Honors   Ph34r.   Bio  Stuff.  I don't know.  It was stupid.   PE  It was cold.  I walked.   Latin  Don't even TALK to me about irregular verbs.  Nolo volo non vis non.. [gives up]   Engrish  Haha.

      Damn my dad PISSING ME OFF....again.  Shit.   So anyhow, had a pretty interesting day.  I shall now type.  Unless, of course, the hubby comes in and wants the f*cking computer.  *roar*  Period 0 -- Biology H: We spent the first 20 minutes or so working on the labs that we have due....ALL at the SAME time. Stupid Adams. I have just concluded that all FAT men are STUPID and lack COMMON SENSE. Freaks. Anyhow. Then he spent the second half of the class lecturing. Have I mentioned how STUPID his VOICE is? Well, it's CRAPPY. Anyhow. Stupid class. Test tomorrow. Going to FAIL.   Break -- Media Center: Went to the Media Center to work out our POW. Stupid thing. At first, we tried finding the volume of half the sphere and then subtracting that from the volume of the cone. Logically, that would have given us the answer. But NO. Stupid thing came out NEGATIVE. How the HELL does it come out negative? We checked it over twice. Then we use the Pythagorean Thereom and we THINK we have it until the idea is shot down AGAIN on some dumbass technicality. Anyhow. After an hour and half, we finally realized that our FIRST answer was right and that we just wasted 1.5 hours FREAKING DEBATING. BULLSHIT. Anyhow. Oh yes. I dissed Wimer about her height....she SLAPPED me. o.O   Period 1 -- English 1H: Lalala...talked about the mystery story. Dahlberg read us something from his memoirs book that he gave to his dad. Interesting, for lack of a better word. Lovely. Can't wait to read Joseph's KKK story.....oiiiii.  Period 2 -- Ceramics: Video bulletin. Ima FAIL this class, I am.   Period 3 -- Algebra 2H: We went through the notes....took us the whole damn period. Whoever wanted to know about composite functions ANYHOW? Damn shit. THEN she tells us that we have until THURSDAY to do the POW. HOLY @#$(#*&#%$&#%. I was MAD. Anyhow.   Period 4 -- Drama: Real fun. Gina stole Rose from us! Rose was OUR partner. Fine. So me and Squirt worked on the scene by OURSELVES. We don't NEED Rose. Hahaha.   Period 5 -- World History H: Took the "Night" test. That test was HARD. It took me 4 hours to write a damn notecard, and I STILL failed. Poopers.   Period 6 -- Basketball: We met up with Ed, convinced him not the have conditioning this week because of the RAIN. We are TOO good. Then we went and dropped off our bags. Laura the munch....Jody turned it in for her. We still have to check in.   After School: I wanted the go through the nursery....but it wasn't OPEN. So then we had to go and walk the LONG way. For those of you who have no life and happen to know the streets, we walked along Wedgeworth, turned on Flamstead, walked ALL THE WAY down Sigman, up Stimson, and ALL TE WAY up Halliburton. By the time we got to Stef's house, school was out for the other people. They probably beat us home. We're trying NEW methods! I messed with Stef's piano. I CAN STILL SIGHT-READ! Boo-yah. Awwww.....now Stef's determined to beat me. XDDD   Homework: ~ Study for Biology test  ~ Algebra II  ~ Character Biography  ~ Artistic Response   BLAH.  ~ Platypus.

      Well well well.....today was rather interesting, to say the least.    Period 0 -- Biology H:  Yay.  We got to look at the lovely bacteria that grew outta Mr. Adams' ear.  You have NO IDEA how badly I wanted to barf.  Blech.  Period 1 -- English 1H:  Quite interesting quiz.  Rather....unprovocative, save for the dispute about number 19, I believe it was.  Watching the movie tomorrow.  WOOT!    Period 2 -- Ceramics:  The only reason I haven't dropped this class is because QQ will kill me if I do.  Period 3 -- Algebra 2H:  We had a sub.  And poo for me, I knew the sub through basketball.  Oh yeah, we also bought our HOUSE from her.  Oiiii.  So we're sitting there doing all this stupid radical shit and she's just like, "So Jessica, what'd you get for number 3?"  POOOOOOOOPERS.  She took a seating chart and picked one person from each row.  So she's reading off names and then she gets to my row and is just like, "Jess, what's the answer?"  Shampooper-scoopers.  Period 4 -- Drama:  What fun.  We played "Hilarium."  It's quite fun.  We got killed.  *sniffle*  Period 5 -- World History H:  We spent the entire period supposedly creating our lovely artist responses.  It was fun.  JIMMY!  TALK TO ME!  After school: It was pouring.  Me, Stef, and Jody couldn't possibly walk home.  So we stayed out in the rain until 3:30.  My hands were dead.  I was about to die of hypothermia.  Mrs. Shiroma is my savior!  LOL.  You shudda seen our hands.  They were so red.............whatever.  I'm warm now....*grin*

      OMFK.  We're screwed.  Dead.  DIED.  BLOWED UP.  KA-BOOMIE!  KA-BOOSH!  We played L.A. yesterday.  Gotted blown out.  But you know what was WORSE?  The fact that....um.....Stacey and Daphne were kind of there.....yeah.  That kinda sucked shit right there.  Stace got there during pre-game warm-ups.  Oiiii.  All of a sudden Nakatani comes up and is like, "Hey, Jessica, guess who's HEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEERE!"  In a damned sing-song voice.  So then, stupid me, I bit.  So did Laura.  Then we sawed Stacey, and we zoinked.  My Kuriboh.  AND we were making shots before we saw here.  Startin' right after that, not a SINGLE SHOT went in.  EVER.  That whole day.  No shot went in.  :(  That's bad.  Uh oh.  Then DAPHNE camed.  *ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!*  But she was LATE!  She should RUN.  She BAD.  Bad bad bad bad.  Anyhow.  We lost.  Yup.  And....um....I shot from about 30 feet out.  IT ACTUALLY HAD A CHANCE!  IT DID!  Oh my Kuriboh.  We ran one of our plays, "Blink," and I drove through the lane and got a wide-open lay-up.  'Member what I said about not making a single shot?  Yeah.  Guess what happened.  Yeah.  Missed.  I swear there was NO ONE around me for about 3 miles.  Oh yeah.  Laura had three turnovers in about 15 seconds.  o.O.  Something something.  So basically, we finished our team meeting and so me and Laura went out to get our stuff, which, unfortunately, was right under the coaches.  Damn.  AND they saw us.  Motioned for us to go sit with them.  Yeah.  Laura and me hid under the bleachers.  But they got us anyhow.  During halftime of the varsity game.  Oiiii.  Me and Laura got chewed out pretty bad.  Haha.  Christina was smart and ran away with her mommy.  Salena was smart and sat on the stands opposite our side.  But not.  Laura and I were stupid.  XDDD  Yeah.  Varsity lost.  Then we went to watch the Mesa-Cedarlane game.  MESA WON!  Stupid Daphne.....she was on the wrong side!!!!!  BAD BAD BAD.  Michelle messed up pretty bad, too.  But she did the best outta everyone!  Oiiii.  Lovely "double suicides" are in store.  We're SCREWED.  DEAD DEAD DEAD.  OMK AND Daphne took me and Jody home.  So then she drops Jody off first and then she started going on about how much we're going to run and shit.  *sniff*  She didn't wanna crash the car and injure Jody and me.  I am at a loss to understand why not.  Apparently, she didn't want us to get hurt and have Stacey blame it on her.  Poop.  We're screwed.  In tears just WRITING this stupid thing.

      I'm back.  :)  Today sucked.  Yay.  Argh, Troy is having some "Find your soulmate!" crap so they made us take a test thing.  I found my soulmate through Kathy, who decided to tell me the name of the poor guy who is apparently stuck with me for life.  What bull.  I pity any girl who has Nelson on her list of soulmates.  Such horrors.    Period 0 :: Geometry Honors  I.. failed.. the first.. test.. of.. the..semester.  I don't know HOW I did it, but I did.  Dude, I lost ten points for not showing work *alone.*  Bitch.  I did too show work.  In my fucking HEAD.  Who needs to subtract 38 from 180 on paper?  Not me.   Period 1 :: ICT  Ooooo.. we're going to get our wiring crap tomorrow.  XP  Time for me to rig people's boards so they get shocked when they touch 'em.. [nasty smile]   Period 2 :: History  A movie on China under Mao!  I hate how Farr pronounces his name.  Goddammit.  The video had testimony in Chinese, which was awesome because I wasn't one of the people staring at the screen all blankly and crap.  W00t.   Period 3 :: Biology  Test tomorrow.   Period 4 :: PE  Yaaaay no more hurdles!  XD  We're doing the 400 meter dash/sprint now.  Whoop-de-doo.   Period 5 :: Latin  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH.  Board games.  Roman board games.   Period 6 :: English   Simon is the Christ figure.  He stumbled  three times  before dying.  He comes to deliver  great news  but people put him down and  KILL HIM .   Therefore, he is Christ.    What bull.

PERIOD 2 -- CERAMICS:  Ima fail, I swear to Kuriboh I'm a-failin.   PERIOD 3 -- ALGEBRA 2H:  Wow.  I'm not failing this class!  YEAH!  I actually have one of the higher grades in the class.   PERIOD 4 -- DRAMA:  It rocks having Laura as a partner.  We screw around the whole time.  Talk about how Stacey'll torture us.  Shit.  CIF ends in two days.  Oh my Kuriboh.  Daphne was right!

      Oh.  My.  God.  I haven't blogged here, for like, a month.  Jesus Christ.  Sorry to... the.. fans.  (What fans?)  And to Platypus, just because.  XD  Hee.  Platypus is coming over on Saturday.  And there's no school tomorrow!     Geometry:  Butthole.  I got a C on the test.  Wtf?  Honestly, loci will be the death of me.  Damn you, stupid circle things.  Damnnn youuuuu.  I'm still trying to find out a way to read manga in this class without getting caught.  Sure thing.   ICT:  Squee.  We're in Farr's class because they're painting Mr. Allen's room.  And since Allen is such a freaking practical joker, he took a copy of ICT homework and stuck it up on the wall next to all the country's flags.  ICT is a country now, yay!  He wanted to move the picture of Bill Clinton to the sixteenth president's place so (and I quote) "he'd get assassinated earlier."  Aha.  I love this class.  That was so random.   NWCultures  I want Vietnam war era music.  It kicks modern music's lame little butt in every aspect.   Every aspect .  It's sad, too.  Not about love and people screwing each other and all that overrated crap you see every time you turn on the telly.  So, we're learning about the Vietnam War, if you haven't noticed.  We're watching a really interesting documentary, too.  :D   Bio  Holy  shit .  Hardest test.   Ever .  48 multiple choice, 9 diagram labelling questions, 1 essay/diagram question, and 2 analytical questions.Oh, and all on the nitrogen cycle.  I ask you:  HOW the hell do you generate  that  many questions on one stupid little cycle?  Granted, a lot of the multiple choice's were repeats/rewordings of the same question.  I must've answered  Nitrogen fixation  (B) at least seven times.    PE  LOL, we played basketball.  Girls v. girls, because if it's coed.. I swear, the guys are  insane .  'Twas fun.  Me, Sheila, Emily, and Cristina v. Joanne, Shannon, and people.  :P  I said 'squee' way too many times.  Cristina was laughing at me.  Nyo.   Lunch  Heeee.  We spent the whole period in Hall's bio classroom.  I learned somebody's name.  Woohoo.  Oh, and that one girl put a snake on my head.  The snake's name is Tom Riddle.  Fuck you.   Latin  We just did a test all period.  Boring.  Seriously, there is -nothing- to write about.   English  Starting a poetry unit!  @@;  We stood on top of the desks to see the English room "from a different viewpoint," which is apparently what poetry is.  And then we brainstormed sensory words.  "Squee, &uuml;berl33t, squishy, and videogames."  God, I love this stupid class.  And now I'm home.  I just realized I have this nasty looking cut on my arm, and it's bleeding.  And I have  no idea  where it came from.

      This weekend was fun, I suppose, even if it wore me out like cRaP.    ~ Saturday ~  Went to coach them ickle ones again.....they're actually going to start playing games!  OMG....that's going to SOOOOO funny!  They best be winning, too, if they know what's good for them.  Hahaha.  Afterwards, Nemo and Gurgle came over to my house to make cupcakes for Steph.  Buuuuuuut, we decided not to, since Stacey just HAD TO BE rearin' to get us back.  We ended up playing Nintendo (Nemo, give it up) and cards.  Nemo can give up P-I-G, too, she SUCKS!  Hahaha.  She's okay at Big 2, though, Ima give her that.  Anyhow.  We watched "Finding Nemo" (AGAIN) and took little naps, all in turn.  Very synchronized it was.    Aiyah then we went to practice......Oiiii.  Stacey LIED!  She said she wasn't going to be there for practice this week, so we thought it was just going to be Trisha again, but Connie ended up coming.  Stacey came in about 15 minutes into practice......  Hahaha.  Daphne came around 4:15....THEN we scrimmaged the boys.  Again, .  Hahaha.  I THINK we might've won.  Well, they won because they got both "last baskets", but point-wise, I think we got 'em.  Hehehe.  But I had this nice, spiffy crossover in front of this one guy.  Oiiii.  Massive sideburns, dude.  LOL.  I'm SOOOOO mean.  Anyhow.  That was practice.  Came home, took a shower, and was ready to flop into my comfy little bed and just SLEEP.  But no.  We ended up going out to HomeTownBuffet to eat.  Aiyah.  I saw FOUR people I knew there!  William, Tammy, Justin, and Brian!  AiYAh!  We always see people there!  Dude, massive line, though.  Aiyah.  Came home and SLEPT.  ~ Sunday ~  Man, I HAVE to stop waking up at 6:50 on weekends.  I swear it's because I'm so used to having my brain actually WAKE UP around 6:50.....seeing as zero period starts at 6:51.  But yeah.  Hahahah Got up and saw the Momster making cupcakes.  She said it was because we didn't make them yesterday and she was doing it herself!  Hahaha.  Anyhow.  Went back to bed around 10....slept 'til about 12.  Woke up, got ready, and picked up Gurgle.  Lalala drove to the game and everything.  I know.  It's just SO descriptive.  I know.  It's a gift.  So Cat ended up getting there REAL LATE....it's just a good thing the game before us went into oVaTiME.  I dunno....today's game was just kind of a blur.  I don't think anyone really got into it.  Dunno why.  It was *whoosh* over our heads.  Yeah.  We lost.  Wooot!  Go Gurgle!  She blocked this one girl's shot and she actually mADe her shot!  WOOT!  Haha.  Aiyah, we're SCREWED OVER for practice next week.....what was it?  SEVEN missed lay-ups?    AND Stacey still hasn't gotten us back for the cupcake thing, which was really HER fault.  But still, DOUBLE .  Haha.  I like that face.  Hahaha.  Trish and Stacey were sore today, though.  They scrimmaged Greg's team after practice yesterday for TWO hours.  Hahaha.  Losers.  *runs*   ~ Platypus oOoooooOOOooOo and congrats to Stef and Ushi for taking first AGAIN at County.  STATE!  WOOT!

      I actually wrote this yesterday....so just pretend I posted this yesterday, too.  XDDD  HOLY SMACKEREL!!!  Today was SOOOOO AWESOME!  Hahaha.  Too bad I have a whole crapload of homework I should have started a LONG time ago.  Woot!  I'm DONE!  Ok.  So.  About this weekend.  Saturday: Started out okay....I even got outta TAing for thost ickle brats because there were only TWO kids there, and the teacher was too cheap to have me TA that extra hour.  FINE.  Haha.  Went home and chilled for a while *translation: slept* until I realized it was time for practice.  Crappit I was SOO not ready.  Hahaha.  Then my mom told me we needed to leave RIGHT THEN.  That's why my hair was all f***ed up.  Whatever.  Practice was okay....save for the couple thousand times we ended up running lines for not making layups.  Haha.  We did plays most of the time.  Blah blah blah.  Hahaha then we left and we ALL went to Laura's house to make CUPCAKES for Stacey.  It was Stacey's birthday today.  Took us FOREVER.  We must've cost Mrs. Higashi about $300 in that Resolve stain remover thing.  *coughNemocough*  Anyhow.  We went through Finding Nemo.  OMG Michelle is SUCH A DORK!  Hahahah.  We were playing the "Thing" game.  She sucks at it!  She got it today, though.  I bet she went home and practiced all night.  Haha.  Got home and slept at 10!!!!  Woot!  Sunday: Was up at 7.....I dunno why.  I'm stupid like that.  Mulled around and did NOTHING for the first 5 hours of today.  Then Jody calls and says she needs a RIDE.  I mean, talk about short notice.  Hahahaha.  So Michelle's already there when we get there.  Trish can right after we got there.  We went to stretch and put on shoes, blah blah blah.  I SWEAR THAT OCBC PLAYS FOOTBALL!  Nobody listened to me.  But it's okay.  I know I'm right.  *grin*  The game wasn't bad, considering it was the first game and we'd only had two frikkin' practices.  Anyhow.  We were down 4-0 until about 10 minutes in.  Hahaha.  Pathetic, I know.  I don't even know what the halftime score was.  Anyhow, I just know we went on a crazy run right after halftime.  Our lead was 7 at one point.  DAMMIT WE LET IT GET AWAY.  *sniffle*  Couple of bad plays down the stretch, partly at the expense of yours truly.  Final score: VFW(them) 20 - SOC(us) 19.  CRAPPIT.  Aiyah.  But it's okay.  They shouldn't have won, but whatever.  We'll get 'em next time.  They beat us by 30 points last time and they were LAUGHING at us, but we shut 'em up good today.  But the real excitement was AFTER the game.  XDDD  Mrs. Higashi ended up getting a card and flowers, so we had to get everyone to sign the card and stuffs.  Then I tilted the flowers.  NOBODY TOLD ME THERE WAS WATER IN THERE!  Shiite.  But I righted it, just as I always do.  Haha.  We half-sang "Happy Birthday" to Stacey....it was kinda sad.  But Salena gave her the card and I gave her the flowers.  I shudda shoved them in her face *roar*.  Hahah.  We offered the cupcakes to her and she was all suspicious.  SHE DON'T TRUST US!  Hahaha.  We asked Connie whether or not Stacey would be okay with getting caked.....she said probably.  But she ditched us for work.  Anyhow.  We weren't really going to cake Stacey, but she came up behind Nemo and caked NEMO.  Well now, you can't expect us just to sit there and not do anything, can you?  We all chased after her.  LOL I think she needs to start conditioning with us.  We all outran her.  She was in flip-flops, but who cares?  Haha.  We got her SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD.  Hahaha.  She only got about half of us.  Strength in numbers.  It works.  Hahaha.  So then we come back to where our stuff is, and Salena takes the big bucket of ice water and dumps it ALL OVER Stacey.  It was awesome.  I got her two more times, AND I put ice down her back.  DAMMIT NOBODY REMEMBERED TO BRING WHIPPED CREAM.  Oh well.  She got me real good, though.  I had to wash my jersey.  Hahaha.  Yeah.  Had to do it before my mom got home.  My dad didn't even notice.  Yup yup.   Well then.  That was my lovely day.  Or rather, my lovely weekend.  Now that it's overwith....we're starting to think about what's going to happen NEXT WEEK AT PRACTICE *dies*.  Whatever.    Happy Birthday, Stacey!!!!     See? We got you a gift!  Wahahah.  *runs*

I didn't get the horse-boy thing....  It was kinda weird.  Me did not get.  And that thing about the Grape Dance?

The talented Platypus fixed it!  Period 4: Went over our scene.  We are SO SCREWED OVER.  HAhaha Jackie was SUPER pissed off.  I don't blame her, though.  I'd be ticked off if I were her.  LOL  We kept messing up.  Scene goes up TUESDAY o.O  Lunch: Kekek.  First thing I saw was Stef coming toward me going, "I'M NOT TALKING TO YOU!!!"  LOL.  Buttcrack.  What the hell were you waiting for, Stef?  You KNEW they were going to win.  Haha.  Why the heck you forgive Jody, eh?  You leave me with TRACEY?  So yeah.  STef's not talking to me because the LAKERS WONNNNNNED!  LOL.  More story.  I was DRUNK during lunch today  LOL.   xDDDD  I finished eating and I was facing the carts.  Being the awesome citizen I am, I look for a trashcan.  That's what they're FOR, LITTERBUGS!  So I see one on either side of me, both equidistant.  So I head right.  LOL Jei says it's gay.  So I walk all 40 steps there and back and when I get back Speedo goes, "You know there was a trash can RIGHT THERE, don't you?"  She's pointing right next to Mrs. Cheng's cart.  XDDD.  End of storytime.  Period 6: We had conditioning....with EIGHT people.  We played 3 on 2.  Me and Christina lost *nodnod*.  What the hell did you expect, eh?  haha.  Mrs. Cheng took us home.  Then me and JOdy went down toe Quickly.  GUESS WHO WE SAW, EH?  TIFF!  I had NO IDEA!!  Okieday Ima tired BYEEEEEEEe.

      Oh holy shiiiiiiiit.  Top my day.  Do it.  Do it!  Do it!  ... That sounded weird.  Well, my day sucked and I don't really wanna talk about it, but Platypus is making me.  So, without further ado,  on with da show!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   {cough}   Period 0 // Honors Geometry, d00d.  Boring as hell, but that was to be expected.  Guess what we're learning?  Yup!  The  volume of spheres , my god.  Somebody save me.   Period 1 // ICT  ... ... ... Somebody stole our fucking board.  Yeah.  So now me and An don't have a wiring board, which means we can't wire labs.  Yeah.  Isn't that fantastic?  I thought so too.  So I spent the period.. like.. wandering.  And unbending ICs.   Period 2 // History  Yum, movie quiz.   Gandhi  movie quiz.  I'd have aced it, but I spent most of the movie sleeping.  Which means I didn't ace it.  But that's okay.  :(   Period 3 // Biology  I... forgot what we did.  Oh yeh.  Standards.  We looked over them in our lab groups.  Was boring as hell, but then me and Jazzy started talking about Anime Expo and cosplaying stuff.  And how pathetic my review of Weiss Kreuz was.  Er... Then we looked at bugs in her bug book.  [nodnod]   Period 4 // PE  HOLYFUCKINGSHITHOTASHELLOUTSITEDANGIT.  Very nearly got sunstroke and died.  >>;  Purposely struck out so I wouldn't have to run.  [cough]  They were bad pitches, anyway.  Never got near two feet to the bat.  Then slumped back to the locker room.  Talked to Shannon.   Period 5 // Latin  {snooze}  I wowed the class with my knowledge of the word "apparatus."  Woohoo!  -_-"  Oh, god damn it, honestly.  I refuse to believe that in a class of freshmen, sophomores, and juniors, the tiniest  freshman  was the only one who realized that apparatus was a derivative from  paratus .  Gimmeabreakman.   Period 6 // English  Yum, poems.  [eats them]  Had to explicate a love poem.  Ohboyohboy.  -.-;

      Well well well, Stef.  Someone's been having too much damn fun on the xangas, ya think?  lol.  Anyhow.  Bloddy leg.  Can't do frikkin squat.  At all.  [Saturday] Meh....class in the morning, had to miss lil stars for an ortho appointment...but it's not like anyone else went anyway.  Damn, spent THREE frikkin HOURS in the damn ortho office....but oh well.  Went home and grabbed a quick bite before heading to practice.  Hadn't eaten anything all day.  Meh.    Practice sucked.  *nodnod*  We did FIVE sets of eights....  Holy CRAP it sucked.  I could barely breathe, it was so damn hot in that stupid gym.  We split up and did different things....Trish made me and Ushi do our "point-guard move"...LOL.  It was the one Ushi kept trying to do in the summer .  Crap, our free throws died.  I made two of three....the one I missed was an airball..........OOPS.  LOL.  So then Trisha gets all excited and wants to scrimmage....  Crap.  It was me, Nemo, Cat, Christina, and Daphne against Ushi, Jody, Steph, Trish, and Connie.  I think we lost.  Hahaha.  So we're going and I'm back trying to stop then from scoring, and I jump off my left foot.  HOLY COWSERS all of a sudden the stupid calf tightens and it cramps up.  Man, that hasn't happened to me since maybe 5th grade.  Forgot how much that thing hurts.  *sob*  So yeah, after that, all I remember is Daphne sitting there going, "We're going to stretch it out, ok?  It's gonna hurt, but that's the only way..."  So I'm sitting there thinking, "Oh great."  Haha.  Anyhow, Ushi told me what happened....my eyes were completely shut.  Hahaha.  She said Mr. Kikkawa came over and pushed my foot upright and Mr. Choy was trying to massage the thing out.  HE IS STRONG, CAT!!!!  Wow.  It HURT.  So yeah.  After that, we ended practice.  LOL STEPH BROUGHT FOB DRINKS!!!  Hahaha.  Psh...Daph insisted on talking to my mom about my asthma...meh.    [Sunday] Woke up, and the first thing I felt was a shooting pain in my leg. Platypus was sad.  She wanted to PLAY!!!  So she tries walking down the stairs, and KABLOOEY!!!!  The Platypus falls.  Hahaha.  No, it's not funny, but in a sense, it kind of is....  So she tries jumping....to no avail.  So the Platypus gets a ride with Jody and the Poop.  We got there at 1:20, and for once, CAT WAS EARLY!!! Props, Cat.  LOL.  Lalala.  So the Platypus starts the game, despite having a big pain in her leg.  Platypus is still mad at her leg.  *nodnod*  So platypus picks up two fouls about 30 seconds apart from each other and has to sit. So we're up by about 4 going into halftime.  Second half, Platypus plays for about 3 minutes.  Then, on one stupid possesion, Platypus trips over some buttcrack's shoe and pulls her calfie again.  THE PAIN.  STUPID REF.  I'm hobbling to the bench....can't even get to the other side of the floor.  HE JUST KEEPS PLAYING!!!!  WHAT THE HEY?!?!?!  FINALLY, someone fouls some other girl and she's shooting free throws, and the Platypus finally gets to get out and strretch out hte stupid calf.  THE PAIN.  SO about three minutes later, we're up by one and Stacey asks me if I can play.  Crap, I was like, "Screw the leg, hell yeah."  Meh.  It HURT.  So with one second left, we're down by three.  Time out...blah blah blah.  THe play is set up and I'm supposed to come across the double screen and shoot the three.  Hahaahah so I get open for about a second and this one defender rushes out, so I cut in to lose her.  Then Ushi throws the ball, and Platypus looks back like, "Oh SHIT....there goes the ball!!!!!"  Hahaha.  The Platypus beats some other girl to the ball and chucks it up....not even close.  Meh.  THe leg.  I swear I would kill it if it weren't a part of me.  [Monday] Meh....no block schedule today.  It was rather boring.  It was HOT.  Too lazy to give you all a rundown.  STupid thing.  Six period, we didn't do ANYTHING!!!  Or , rather, me and Ushi didn't have to.  Everyone else had to do 100 calf raises....hahah Ushi's transferring over soon.  Platypus told Ed that she killed her calf on Saturday and couldn't do anything....YAY!!!  Meh.  Lemme see.  Does I gots homework today?  Meh, don't think so!!!  WOOOOOOT!!!!  Crap, there's so much crap due Wednesday, though.  Ima START.  HEY POOP, AREN'T YOU JUST SO PROUD OF ME?!?!?!?  ~Kleenex

We compared our world to Shakespeare's world using a venn diagram.  Under "Both", the Platypus put "men are egotistical and absolutely refuse to can it."  funniful awesome!!!   third period  Meh.  Combinatorics.  Again.  It was fun.  I got confused.  AND I got stuck with the crap job again.  Great.  Just 'cause I'm the freshman.  Meh.   fifth period  HOLY SHIT EVERYONE FAILED THIS TEST.  HAHHAHA. I got a............36/80.  LOL.  That was one of the higher grades in the class.  SHIT.  I was up until 2 doin history this morning too.

      TWO DAYS IN A ROW OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!11111!1!!!ONEONEELEVENTWELVE   zero period  More bullshit.  We're learning how to find the volume of pyramids now.  Oh my fucking god, a pyramid!  Fan me, I'm keeling under the difficulty of this shit.   second period  An hour and a half of  Gandhi , which wouldn't be such a bad movie if we didn't have to watch it all at once.  And if the chairs weren't so uncomfortable.  Ugh.  Had to keep shifting so I wouldn't obstruct everyone's view.  Remind me why I'm right next to the projector screen again.   fourth period  TWO HOURS OF PE.  OH SHIT.  Softball.  Not bad, but could be better.  Nearly got hit by the bat.  Stupid, stupid, stupid Kevin.  My team is amusing, and I think there was horse crap near the fence.  [blinks]  Okay...   sixth period  STAR testing, man!  I'm still reeling over the example change, and now this.  There's only one question I  know  I got right: the one with the Latin root of provide.  At least I think it's right.  It couldn't possibly have rooted from aedificere [to build]... or the other ones.  I went with "to see."  Videre.  Moo.  The test took about ten-fifteen minutes for me.  After it, I reread  Deception Point  (439 pages), wrote out the lyrics to  American Pie , and stared at the ceiling.  How utterly amusing.  And now I'm home, and Mother-dear just let me buy Zazel's  DxD  single and a 1.5 GB mp3 player.  So there IS a God...         Just kidding.

      Yo, man.  I haven't been here in ages  again .  This is pathetic.  Woohoo.  Anyway, one good thing happened today.  My mom found  Reanimation .  Been looking for that thing since I lost it, which was like... a year ago.  [cough]   zero period  Bullshit.  Pure bullshit.  We're learning how to find the volume of prisms.  Somebody save me.  I'm drowning in a pool of stupidity.  AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!  Okay, I'll stop now.   first period  I love this class.  It's so... freaking frustrating.  We spent an hour and a few minutes on Lab 13, but it turned out to be a lot harder than it looked.  o_o;;  We still don't have it, by the way.  Used all our wires and ten of Jeremy's, and we're still not done.  Something tells me we need a  lot  of help on this one.  Damn you, 7447 and 7476 things.  Damn you.  Oh, and our seven-segment displayer thing's middle segment shorted out, but Allen won't give us a new one.  Isn't that lovely?   break  Walked with An to Biology, where I acted like a nerd and did Latin homework (Or what I thought was Latin homework.  Turns out it wasn't assigned at all and I was dreaming.)  Then An left and Cristina came in, so I talked to her.  Yep.  Was quite boring.   third period  Two bloody hours of biology.  I don't know how I managed to survive.  I mean, seriously.  I fell asleep six times, was woken up all six times, had stomach pains (was so hungry), was twitching (we're studying the circulatory system and he was talking about needles), and didn't feel too great in general.   lunch  Xavier won the Anime Club secretary position.  Which is all spiffy for me, since I still get to design the AC website.  I plan on blackmailing the board people to get a domain and a host so I can do this properly.  Whatever.   fifth period  Two hours of LATIN.  UGH.  First few minutes were translating, more translating, and then... okay, a full hour of translating.  Then we made mosaics out of paper.  Do you know how hard it is to make a mosaic out of paper?  And glue the little eensy weensy squares onto another paper?  With shitty school glue and kiddy scissors?  Ow.   Can't wait till tomorrow, those blocks are more fun...

      RIP Connie Wei-Luen Kao 09.05.1989 - 04.08.2002  Two whole years...how fast it's been.  Seems like only yesterday we were playing around, competing against each other, and making complete fools of ourselves.  Not a day goes by in which I don't think about how life would be different with you here, to help and to guide me, as you had done for 10 years.  We truly brought out the meaning of "best friends forever"....and it was great.  Meeting you the second day of preschool with Anna, running around the playground and screaming and laughing, has changed my life in a way nothing else ever could.  We were the teachers' pets all the way through preschool, and we entered kindergarten together at Mesa.  I can still remember those sessions where Mattson let us do first grade work, and the worksheet about Donald Duck rowing the boat cracked us up for some silly reason.  Everyday we would mess around and have fun and grow closer and closer.  Second grade year, Wesley came, and the three of us grew even more inseparable.  The fight between you and Wesley had me running around between the both of you....and yet, at the end of the year, we all emerged as one.  We swore to be best friends forever, and only through the later years has that proven itself true.  Your smile and personality eventually led you to become friends with everyone, and though we didn't "hang out" as often, our bond was never broken.  Our daily competitions for the better grade continued, and I remember the GATE test being pretty significant.....  Everything was going great; we both excelled in every aspect and tossed challenges back and forth, and I can truly say those challenges that you put me up against shaped my life, and I hope mine did the same for you.  Then came seventh grade year.  I had been a constant show-up at all your birthday parties, always held the weekend before the beginning of the school year.  This was the one time I turned you down to go with my family on vacation, and I regret that beyond all.  I still remember the first day of school when we settled in Mekenian's seventh grade GATE class....you leaned over to me and said, "These are all smart people...I'm not going to be top of the class."  Even then you showed your impossibly accurate interpretation of the people around you.  The Friday before Spring Break was a happy one; after school, we met at the lockers and said our good-byes.  How I regret not making more of our time together that day.  The Monday back from Spring Break was the polar opposite.  At first, I heard only snatches of conversation about what had happened over the weekend.  Then I heard your name.  Disbelief flooded inside me, denial took over.  Noranbrock broke the news to the class, and there was a stunned silence in the room.  I couldn't believe it.  I refused to believe.  Second period, still in denial, I was addressed by Mr. Lee again about what had happened. The seriousness of the situation bit at me....I was still refusing to believe.  Passing period, from second to third, hit me hard.  I passed by Wesley, and I saw her eyes.  At once, my fears were confirmed.  She had been undoubtedly crying, and I knew there was no way out.  We hugged but said nothing.  The bell rang.  Into third period.  The counselors were there; they came to all your classes.  It was then that I understood -- you were gone.  The truth hit me harder than anything ever had; I broke down.  Nor was I the only one to do so, more than half the class was.  I remember the questions meant to help us.  They did not console me; in fact, they hurt me further.  I realized and began to think back to all those times I could have talked with you just a bit longer, listened just a bit better, as you had always done for me.  Mekenian came over after the counseling, and she comforted me.  Nothing ran through my mind but the last image I had of you; the last glimpse of you I had....running out of the locker section towards Spring Break.  The rest of the day was pandemonium.  Chinese School, which had been your second home, and mine as well, greived as a whole.  No one said much, but the feelings were unmistakable.  The funeral was held a week later, and attended by more than 800, all of whom had been touched by you, Connie, you, a 12-year-old girl who knew and accepted nothing but happiness and victory.  I stood on the second floor, the balcony, of SkyRose Chapel and listened to the various eulogies given by the guests, and it shocked me, though it shouldn't have, the number of people you touched within 12 years.  I had been one of the luckiest, to have known you for so long and been able to talk to you whenever I needed to.  As I approached the casket, I was numb with grief and shock, for I was not yet ready to accept.  I said my final good bye to you.  Last year, this very day, was hard on everyone.  Your garden had been dedicated on the 5th of September, 2003.  The various messages written on the table Calton had brought out brought me into remorse once again, knowing you had done so much for me, yet I did not come close to returning the favor.  Graduation came, and the entire class thought about you as your presence was felt as the names were read off.  You were honored.  We were silent.  And now, you have led me into a new direction once again; this is the most personal thing I have written in quite a while.  You were always there for me whenever I needed it, and, make no mistake, you still are.   Ten Years Just Weren't Enough 'Twas the day back to school  After the week of spring break.  Little did I know I would soon learn something  That would cause mine, and many more, hearts to ache.   The students were socializing,  Catching up on a week's sorth of separation.  And then I heard the terrible news  And thought it a figment of imagination.   Came the words of my first period teacher,  "There's been a loss to the Mesa Robles family,"  "Our friend and fellow student Connie Kao hass passed,"  And it was then I knew it true, and tears came readily.   Of course it was hard on everyone  Who knew of the terrible news,  But it depressed me greatly;  I had known you since the age of two.   I really couldn't see or realize what happened that day,  Teachers and friends knew the bond between you and I,  And they tried to console me,  Each patting me on the back quite fondly.   I tried to listen to my friends,  Sure their intentions were true;  Yet how to replace a best friend  I'd known since the age of two?   That day will stay forever in my mind: April 8, 2002;  And now it's been a little over a year and a half.  There is still nothing on Earth  I would not give just to have you back.  In Loving Memory Connie Wei-Luen Kao I miss you.....

      As was previously explained in  urlLink this post , today is our "one year anniversary" of posting in this blog!  Do refer to  urlLink this page  for the gory details.  So it's been a nice long year, no?  I was awfully angsty back then.  Overly so, I think.  >>;  Note:  This is in whatever order I felt like putting it in, which means it's probably not chronological.   Nostalgia Moment.  Yeah.  So... I miss Mesa.  I remember how we all hated Mears with a bloody passion because she was so hypocritical and racist.  Heh, seventh period thought she was so smart-- yeah right.  She'd be dumb as dirt if fifth period hadn't corrected all of her mistakes.  Which reminds me.  I still put "Period 5" on my English papers at Troy.  Fsck yeah.  Honors English pride, man.  {air five}   And Another.  Publications rocked my shoes.  It was the only thing-- the only one!-- that showed I had brains.  I still remember how to develop black and white film.  I feel so utterly proud.  The darkroom was great, but not when you're locked in there with like... six guys.  Who all really, really want to scare you shitless and make you scream.  And laugh.  Damn you, Joe.  Vincent.  Jonathan.  People.  I still remember random conversations, scary as that is.  GEOFFREY:  AAAAHAHAHAHA!  I'm going to-- ME:  Dude, stop bugging me. JOE:  Yeah, stop hugging her. ME: ... Erm, I said bugging. JOE:  Oh.  GUS:  So, Geoffrey, you get the job of making sure the darkroom is in suitable condition for photograph developing.  That means you have to be sure all the temperatures are right, and you have to-- JONATHAN:  Be the custodian! JESSICA:  Janitor! GEOFFREY: That's "darkroom editor" to you. ME:  How the hell do you edit a darkroom?  And of course, it was bloody hilarious when Gus insulted people.  Just because.  Gus rocked.  Nelson keeps saying he's gay.  How can he be gay?  If he got any straighter, he'd be a Larry.  Which reminds me, the:  Larry Nostalgia Moment.  Aaaaaa, Algebra I with Gus was AWESOME.  Doesn't anyone think it was awesome too?  Man, everyone was so smart it was CRAZY.  And Gus is an awesome teacher.  Yes, he is.  Really.  Everyone failed to realize that because he was so much stricter than the other teachers, but that man is smart as hell.  Anyway, so the LARRY.  Once upon a time, Larry needed a ruler.  But, alas, Larry didn't have a ruler.  So, this poor child asked Mr. Gustafson !for a ruler.  Mr. Gustafson, being the kind, caring soul he is, laughed at him.  GUS:  Gosh, Larry!  Just take this paper.  See?  Fold it in half.  See this edge?  It's straight. STRAIGHT-EDGE.  So, if you ever need a STRAIGHTEDGE, fold a piece of paper, crease it, and call it a Larry!  I have my Larry right here.  =D   Random Sixth Grade Non Sequitur Reminiscence.  I thought sixth grade was odd.  We had block schedules and I got lost.  A lot.  But Hansen's third/fourth period block was AWESOME.  AHAHAA, Platypus!  Remember how we almost NEVER got in trouble?  And Table D shall live on in infamy.  Boo-yah.  Eck, I remember I had to sit next to Sergio at the beginning of the year in Table C.  He smelled really, really bad.   Catalina Island  Ooooo, I  >;  Anyway, Jessica (Pumpkin) was my tent buddy person.  We had this huge tree shadow above our tent.  That was scary.  And I swear that half my cot was hanging out the tent.  Sheshca tripped over the metal lining of the tent, scraped her knee, and couldn't do anything water-related for the whole of the trip.  >>;  Except kayaking, which ROCKED.  BOO-YAH.  We had the most awesome group ever.  Our chaperone was Sharky (Jimmy's dad), our Catalina staffer dude was Tommy, and our group number was THREE.  Sharky was awesome and Tommy wore his cheerios shirt!  =D  Yeah, I still remember our group names.  Kinda.  I think we were... Sharky's Cheerios, Triple Threat, and.. other.. stuff.  I think I remember the people in the group, too, but I'm not sure.  Jessica Choochoo, Jei Jai, Sheshca, me, Dennis, Jimmy, and... other.. people.. I... forgot.  Holy crap the food was GOOD.  Haha... yes.  I remember that Jackie had to identify a humpback whale.  Or someone.  The squid dissection was awesome, 'specially cause we ate the squid (cooked, of course) afterwards.  Disgusting once you think about it a little, but hey, we were sixth graders.  We didn't think.  Much.  Like I wrote before, kayaking kicked ass.  Major, major ass.  I think Tommy said something about there being tiger sharks in the kelp, but I didn't see them.  Feh.  Someone got a snake on their kayak, though.  It was funny, and I think Collins identified it as a random ground snake afterwards.  How the hey it got yaaaaards away into the ocean is up for debate, folks.   Another Nostalgia Moment.  The DC trip was, without doubt, one of the best experiences I've ever had, ever.  EVER.  Barring when Platypus and I got lost in Baltimore, it was really great.  Remember when we checked in at the Baltimore hotel?  XD~  We watched all those kiddy shows and sang along with the theme songs-- that was awesome.  The million dollar socks, dude.  Remember?   ^^  The airport was great, too.  Screw Cedarlane vs. Mesa; somehow, I think Newton vs. Mesa was more fit for this one.  Ah... and who could forget getting lost at Mount Vernon?  XD!  Remember, Platypus?     "I can't find the big grass thing!  It's on the map, but it's NOT SHOWING UP IN FRONT OF ME AND--"   "Look.  In.  Front.  Of.  You."   "Oh, there it is."    Map illiterate for life, man.  MAP ILLITERATE PRIDE.  {another air five}  Shear Madness was greaat. THE MALE:  She was too busy picking up HALF OF WASHINGTON's MALE POPULATION. THE FEMALE DUDETTE:  Well, *you* screwed the other half!  Absolutelyfuckingpriceless.  Especially when the guy wore a MESA ROBLES shirt onstage.  Oh man, you shoulda heard the cheering.  =3  Aaaaaaa, the Jefferson Memorial!  That was HILARIOUS.  LOL, I think we were going to be late for the bus, so we were running out towards the entrance.  And then we turned around, and we saw the STATUE.  Holy crap, that was friggin'  scary .  HAHAHA, I screamed.  XD  Gettysburg was kinda creepy.  Eric swore up and down that he saw a ghost.  I'm gonna swear up and down righ' now that he was lying his ugly little Korean ass off.  Hi.  Semi-racist.  Bye.  Oh yeah, one more.  Two words, dude:   BIG TREE.    Random OMGSQUEE Moment of the Week.  Guys who listen to Disney music and aren't afraid of saying so are so cute.      Monday, May 24th:   I.  Hate.  Mondays.  Always and for'ver.  I don't believe we did anything productive, but it was four days ago.  Hey, I can't even remember what I did this morning, okay?   {{ Geometry H &raquo; p0 }}    I think I just zonked out or something.  It can't have been anything special, because I don't remember it.  That and this is  Geometry , folks.  To have something special is to-- I don't know, I don't know.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}    I wired Lab 20, but when we went to get it signed Allen asked us questions and An couldn't answer them!  (#@!$%)  Note to self:  Tutor An before getting the labs signed.  Another note:  Get a better lab partner.  {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}    Nothing, I don't think.  I don't remember what we did at all.  >  {{ Biology H/IB &raquo; p3 }}    Nuuu idea.  Maybe something about notes and IQ's.  {{ PE }}    Oh, this I know.  We played basketball.  Either that or we walked around the gym.  Pick one, any one.  {{ Latin }}    Uhhh.... ??  {{ English }}    Nooo idea, but I'm willing to bet it had something to do with  Romeo and Juliet .  Big surprise.  I think.  We went over.  Act Five.  But I'm not sure.  Decisions, decisions.    Tuesday, May 25th:   Hmmmm.  It's all coming back to me--- oh wait, that was today.   {{ Geometry H &raquo; p0 }}   Still no idea.  Though I did sleep through this class for the entire week, so... I think it had something to do with transformations.  The lesson, I mean.  Arhar.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}   Allen TALKED.  And talked.  And talked.  About multiplying binary numbers.    ALLEN: Okay.  Let's multiply 1 and 0!  What do you get? JOHN:  Two!  That kid's so clueless it's hilarious.  {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}    Oh god, sophomore ID card pictures.  I had nooo idea they were coming up!  >  {{ Biology &raquo; p5 }}    Uhhh... stuff.  Yeah.  {{ PE &raquo; p4 }}     Aaa, basketball or walking around the gym.  It's all you, folks.  Bring this baby home.  {{ Lunch }}    Stuff.  I don't remember!  {{ Latin &raquo; p5 }}   Uhhh.  Stuff.  Again.  Yes.  Probably Heavenbashing, but I'm not entirely sure.  Sowwy.  {{ English &raquo;  p6}}    Lewis assigned the group project and a book report, which is due next Friday.  Six components.  I'ma gonna die.    Wednesday, May 26th   I REMEMBER TODAY!  =D =D  Who could forget?  Troy Tech Fair, man.  All the ubersmart seniors present their internship things in the North and South gyms. I had to go to the fair during third period (Biology) and fourth period (PE).  It got boring  very soon  after a while.  =D   {{ Geometry &raquo; p0 }}    I honestly have no idea.  Really.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}   EARGH.  We had Coach Garland for a sub, so he was really anal about the lab-labeling and stuff.  We spent forever on Lab 21 only to realize I had the XOR thing backwards.  That was... evil.  Just plain evil.   I  We got the components signed and I started on the 22nd lab.    {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}  Woohoo, Cultural Experience!  :D  We had to bring artifacts or food representing our culture.  Heh, and then we had a FEAST.  Hell yeah.  I didn't eat anything, though.  Quite a shame.   Side note:  Why does Josh Pixler have to be so damn tall?   {{ Bio &raquo; p3 }}  Troy Tech fair.  Went with Jazzy, Kathy, and Rachel.  It was fun.  Not really.  ILLUSTRATOR.  [points and twitches]  ILLUSTRATOR.  Haha, Mel rocks.  {{ PE &raquo; p4 }}  More Troy Tech fair.  Watched the guys do Tae Kwon Do stuff whilst Rachel kept going "Kung fu's better!"  {{ Lunch }}  Sheila got called somewhere over the intercom, so we just went over to her English class and watched her  On Parole  class video project thing.  "We" being Sheila, Nataya, and me.  I don't know where Cristina and Emily went.  ^^;  Perhaps they stayed in Anime Club.  Who knows?  {{ Latin &raquo; p5 }}  Mm... I don't know.  I think I had to work with Heaven.  I got mad, but Ryan exploded for me 'cause I was too tired and he hates her more than I do.  Yay!  I do know that the new Latin teacher for next year came in this period.  She's so.. damned.. happy.  >>;  {{ English &raquo; p6 }}  "Worked" on the group project with Bianca, Jessie, and Brian.  Jeremy was outside reading  Catcher in the Rye , so we talked to him too.  Yeah.  Jeremy's an oddball.  We were discussing how boring it would be if everyone were normal (Do  not  ask how this is relevant to Juliet's character.).  Then we practiced for about fifteen minutes.    Thursday, May 27th   Ooh, I think I can remember yesterday.  Yesterday was boring.  But it wasn't bad.  Wait, it was.  Never mind.   {{ Geometry &raquo; p0 }}  Rasch caught me sleeping.  ;.;  HIGH:  Richard can't make fun of me for being so tiny she can't see me.  LOW: She.. caught.. me.. sleeping.  Yeah.  So... not good.  {{ ICT &raquo; p1 }}  Lab time rocks my shoes.  I kept working on Lab 22 and finally finished it.  Got it signed, but was way too lazy to start on the last lab.  So I just... walked there.  Yeji brought her camera, and I avoided it.  Yaaaaaay me.  {{ Nonwestern Cultures IB &raquo; p2 }}  Um, group work.  Um.  Yes.  We didn't actually *do* anything, we just sat there.  I ate a piece of chocolate.  Dark chocolate.  With mint.    {{ Biology &raquo; p3 }}  Took notes and did an IQ for the entire period.  Kristy and Jazzy both stole my notes.  Evil fiends.  {{ PE &raquo; p4 }}  I was in a really freakishly bad mood for some odd reason.  I walked, nay, stomped around the gym humming  Berry .  It's creepy once you think about it for a while, especially if you know the lyrics in the beginning.  ( I'm sorry.  I didn't mean it.  I'll be good.  I'm going to kill you.  I'm going to blow your head open-- like RASPBERRY JAM. )  {{ Latin &raquo; p5 }}  Ehh... some grammar crap and reading.  {{ English &raquo; p6 }}  Group projects' presentations!  It was odd.  Yessss.    Friday, May 28th    {{ GEOMETRY }}  AAAARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH.  ;.;  I swear, I was just counting down the seconds until this crap of a class ended.  >   {{ ICT }}  HELL YEAH, CHARLOTTE WINS.  I wired Lab 23 and we're done.  DONE.  Now we're doing Lab 18 (Already did 8b, 8c, 16, and 17) for extra credit.  Charlotte wins.  Charlotte wins.  Allen still thinks An is slow in the head.   Wow, so fast?  Did you keep An away from the board with a stick?    {{ NONWESTERN CULTURES }}  We were supposed to be doing groupwork, but I just did my geometry homework instead.  It was fun, though, because I got to eavesdrop on all the other groups.  Quite amusing, really.   {{ BIOLOGY }}  Argh, Kirkpatrick came back so we spent the entire period listening to him lecture.  >>;   {{ RALLY }}  Ditched.  We went to Hall's room where Nataya played with Hamlet and Tom Riddle.  Emily and Alice studied for the Biology SAT II.   {{ PE }}  Basukettuballu!  Against people I don't know!  We lost.  Durdur.   {{ LATIN }}  We just did translations for the entire period.

      I had a really, really bad day.  =.=  Right now I'm designing a layout for Sorata's fanlisting and I can't think of a  thing .  So I thought I'd take a break and blog.  =)  In case I don't get around to dropping by tomorrow to leave this note, Platypus and I are holding off blogging from Monday to Thursday of next week.  Then we're both (reportedly and assuming Platypus doesn't forget) going to write our life stories (as a figure of speech, mind) in celebration of our year-long... attendance of this blog.  =D  See how our archives go back to May 28, 2003?  ^_^   [ music ]  Wei&szlig;- One More Angel  So, today.  First Elfie wakes up at 10:20 because she's  dead tired  and slept really, really late last night.  Then Elfie just lies there in bed because that's what Elfie does for the first two hours that she's awake.  But then Mummy and Johnny kick the door open and tell Elfie she has tennis in  forty minutes  and she has to leave in  twenty .  So then Elfie has to get up and change and all that crap and goes to tennis.  Then the tennis teach gives Elfie a SPIDERMAN RACKET and expects Elfie to play tennis with it.  What the hey?  It's a Spiderman racket!  Then Elfie misses the first, oh, six hundred shots the tennis teach hits at her because this retarded Spiderman racket is the most oddly shaped thing in the world.  So tennis goes on for about forty minutes, then Elfie's grandmother comes and picks Elfie up.  She dumps Elfie at her house, where she sits staring into space for forty minutes before Mother-dear comes with food.  And then Elfie ate.  And all was good.  Not.  So now it's 12:20, and Elfie's got piano lessons at the half hour.  She gets to piano lessons, and lo and behold, teacher is in a BAD MOOD.  Now Elfie has to endure an hour of bitchslapping and verbal abuse.  Then, to make all matters worse, Teacher makes Elfie play the Czerny etude for Elfie's CM requirements.  That etude is the most disgusting song ever.  It sounds, oh, roughly like five cats scraping their claw nails against a blackboard in unison.  Add the occasional discordant chord (no pun intended), and you've got Elfie's piano piece.  It sounds better when it's played wrong, but the teacher made Elfie play it right.  Then Elfie had to go to CHOIR.  But the Pumpkin got sick this morning, so she couldn't go and Elfie had to go alone to the stupid place.  We got there and Elfie was bored for a very, very long time.  And then Elfie went home.  And here I am.  The End.

Nicholson was comparing the name to "hyperbole" meaning exaggeration, and she said she couldn't understand why they were called hyperbola thingys.  So I turned around and told Thalia that they's called hyperbolas because if you understand them, your math knowledge is way too exaggerated.  Oh yes.  And then we realized that example three was relative to example two and yeah.  Ahaahhaha we's slow.   Drama -- FOuRth  Last one-act.  WHat fun.  NO, STEF, IMA NOT TELL YOU.  I've already done it.

      Yes, she is, because she hasn't blogged in FOREVER and she keeps telling me to (and is this the third day in a row that I've blogged or am I hallucinating?).  So she gets her little moronic moment for my subject (Hey, she's the one with the screenname moronspeaks.)  Today was SPIFFEH.  Hell yeah.  =D  LOL, and I think Jonathan's proud of himself for finally remembering my name.  XD   [ music ]   Duran Duran - Ordinary World   [ HONORS GEOMETRY &raquo; z3r0 ]  Woohoo, test!  I'm quite sure I did well, but I think I just jinxed myself by typing that.  :X Nonetheless, it was one easy test.  =.=  I think I'll commit suicide if I don't get at least a 95.  Shooting for a high A here.   [ ICT &raquo; 0n3 ]  Omfg.  I have such a pain in the ass for a lab partner.  She's always there when I don't need her at all and never there when I need her.  >>;  I wired Lab 19 without the schematics because someone stole mine (and An's brother took hers), so I made a misake and switched the input and output legs.  The lab didn't work and I rewired it a couple times before realizing my initial mistake.  So when I finally finished, An was  gone .  Elfie was pissed, and everyone I asked knew where she was (the bathroom) while, I, as her poor solitary lab partner, had no idea.  Ooh, and I also got bored and checked my grade.  I was a bit afraid because of the horrible test grade (x.x) but I still have a... rather high A.  :X  This class is now officially too easy for words.  I wonder why Andrea thinks it difficult...?  Whatever.  ICT and FOP are both inhumanly easy.  I wonder what AP Comp Sci will be like.   [ NONWESTERN CULTURES IB &raquo; tw0 ]  'Oly shit, it was boring.  No, really.  There is  nothing  to say-- except maybe that I don't know what to bring for our little "Cultural Experience."  Methinks I shall bring Costco potstickers and pretend they're Chinese. Hey, it was Jazzy's idea, not mine.  Catherine might bring dumplings.  =3   [ BIOLOGY HONORS/IB &raquo; thr33 ]  Ehh... heh... We watched the most, erm,  illuminating  film in the history of BoringDocumentaryClassFilms today.  It was  scary .  Basically, it was about how maggots, leeches, and bee venom are miraculous in regards to healing immune diseases and wounds, as well as aiding in surgical reattachments of InsertBodyPart.  It was  disgusting .  I don't even want to begin describing exactly how graphic this thing was, but let's just say we got our fair share of gushing blood and disembodied, bloody body parts.  Oh, and did I mention we saw maggots and leeches crawling through live human flesh?  Yes... that too.  That guy named his leech Boomer...   [ PHYSICAL EDUCATION &raquo; f0ur ]  Eww, Elfie had a sub for PE.  He was old.  We played "Ultimate Frisbee" (more like a bunch of morons standing in a circle attempting to throw a broken frisbee at each other).  It was fun, though, because Emily kept throwing the frisbee like a boomerang and... I don't know, but I was laughing like a loon.  Quite crazy, actually.  After the bell rang I skipped for a while and then stopped when I saw the NJROTC people swimming (o.O??) 'cause that was scary.  Yes.  I talked in the third person for a while.   [ LATIN &raquo; f1v3 ]  We took a vocab test and I got 24/24 even though I didn't study (at all)!  Yay me.  There is absoutely nothing to say about this class, really.  Fair share of Heaven-insulting ( HEAVEN:  You're looking very brown, Ryan.  (He was being a brown-noser to taunt the teacher 'cos he hates her.)   ERIC:  Was that a  racist comment  there, Heaven?  I'm appalled! ) but apart from that, nothing, really.  =D   [ ENGLISH &raquo; 51x ]  BOO-YAH.  Yesh!  All that stupid slaving with Gus (TORMENT) paid off!  =D =D  Don't know how, but I somehow got a 12 on my district essay thing.  You have no idea how happy I am because of that.  *__*  And we had a bloody high class average, too.  oO;  Yo, Platypus, does Mekenian still have those stupid Valentine'sDayByeByeElectricity essays?  Anyway, more Romeo and Juliet, but that was to be expected.   Damn, I forgot something I was going to write.  Argh.

I get an awful lot of gobbledygook (F5 fixes it, but it's not supposed to appear in the first place), which is odd as this thing is supposed to validate...?  Maybe there should be validation standards for PHP and ASP so it's more viewer-friendly.  I'm rambling again.   [ music ]   L'Arc~En~Ciel - Ready Steady Go   [ HONORS GEOMETRY &raquo; 0 ]  AAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHHH.  I fell asleep.  Couldn't help it, really.  x_x;  And then I just... did tonight's homework so I wouldn't have to do it tonight.  Wow, did I just break the Code of Procrastination?  *runs from Platypus*   [ ICT &raquo; 1 ]  Yum, subtracting.  Only in ICT will you learn how to subtract zero from one in high school.  The wiring looks awfully complicated for so simple a problem.  -_-;  These people need to simplify it.  Or... make a specialized chip to add.  We have no AND circuits after we lost our board, so I don't know how we're supposed to wire Lab 19.  :(  I still have to draw that diagram.  Fsckydoo.   [ NONWESTERN CULTURES IB &raquo; 2 ]  Ugh, remember the seating discrepancy?  Brian stole my seat.  >=O  But Michael made him move, so it's all good.  And some moron killed Rachel's spork.  *fumes*  Thou shalt not harm the spork!  Oo, and I aced the last reading quiz even though I didn't read.  oO;  Same with Brian, though.  How that kid manages to get 100%'s on all his reading quizzes without ever reading is beyond me.   [ BIOLOGY HONORS/IB &raquo; 3 ]  I... hate... worms.  Hate them.  They scare the living daylights out of me (and I remember that one nightmare when the world was just  crawling  with worms.  Yes.  So I was rather uncomfortable in this class.  Not like anyone cares.   [ PE &raquo; 4 ]  Ehhh... played Ultimate Frisbee. =]  Cristina gave me a bloody bruise.  See, I poked her, so she got mad and "poked" me back.  I swear to Mr. Spork that it wasn't a poke.  I think she dug her fingernail into my skin.  xO;  It still hurts when I touch it.  x.x;;   [ LATIN &raquo; 5 ]  Ewwww.  We had Miss Onstad for a sub (This would be the  third  time this month.  $#@$@!) and I finished the classwork in fifteen minutes.  So I did the Romeo & Juliet Act 3 study guide in its entirety and then sat there and averted my eyes from Heaven, who was dancing like a whore.  Not like that's anything  new .    Oooo... and the translation was wrong again, only... it was really bad  (complete with petting, rods, and vibrabat [which actually means brandishing, but I didn't know that at first]).  x]  I was the only person who laughed.  Ehhhh.  o_o?  I blame Cecilia for mentioning petting as a sexual practice yesterday.  Don't ask.   [ ENGLISH &raquo; 6 ]  Mm, Hikki's new single is playing-- Er.  Hookai.  So.  Romeo and Juliet.  Yes, again.  I'm still standing by what Elyse said yesterday.

AHAA LOL I'm eating instant noodles...and they's reminding me of the small intestestines of the piggly-wiggly.  Eh.   Period 1 -- English 1H:  Dahlberg was at jury duty today....I TOLD HIM WHAT TO TELL THEM, but NO.  Oh well.  We watched R & J...the Leo DiCap version....since we already watched the ghetto old school version...so Chris, Owen, and I started a "conversation paper"....hey, at least we didn't TALK.  LOL.  WHeeeeeeeeeeeee.   Period 2 -- Ceramics:  This class is gettin boring...ONLY THREE WEEKS, JESSICA.  GOOOOO.   Period 3 -- Algebra 2H:  Eh.  Notes.  Ellipses.  Graphs.  More notes.  More ellipses.  More graphs.  And, at the risk of sounding redundant, more notes, more ellipses, and even more graphs.   Period 4 -- Drama:  LOL This was awesome today.  OMG we actually FINISHED the scene.

Then we were almost late to practice because Ushi wanted me to play Fur Elise on the piano...I CAN STILL SIGHT READ x_X...   Practice:  I'm TIRED.  So yeah.  Ran "fist" like two trillion times....WAHAHAHA WE DIDN'T HAVE TO DO DEFENSIVE SLIDES!!!  POOOOOOOOOR GURGLE!!!! LOL I WIN.  The JV was doing that....but VARSITY wasn't WAHAHA.  And no, Jessica's not on varsity, she just listens to Ed when he tells her to go with the varisty team...so she's confused.  Then we shot for like 4 billion hours.  Then we scrimmaged.  we got killed 12-4.  Hahahaha.  Yeah.  Then we shot free throws.  My arm died.  Then jessica came home at 7.  It's now 830.  Must start homework.  Eh.

      Before you get all proud of me for blogging  two days in a row  (Mein Gott.) let it be known that I'm procrastinating.  XD  AIM, Photoshop, and (now) blogging: the  ultimate  form of procrastination.  Seeing as I have three blogs I actively participate in.  =3  ... This is random, but BoA (Kwon) has a sixth grade education and she's 17/18.  Whoopsydaisy.   [music]  Three Days Grace - Scared   [ HONORS GEOMETRY ~ period zero ]  Uhhhh.  Yes.  This class was very... erm...  DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH .  Oh yes.  >>;  I mean, seriously.  "Let's plot rectangles on rectangular coordinate planes!"  Bite me, bitch.  And Nelson needs to wash his hair.  Why, oh  why  do I have to sit behind him?   [ ICT ~ period one ]  BWAHAHA.  I made An rewire Lab 17 (Eh.. the last lab she wired was.. 12, I think.  The one with the D flip-flops. And before that... erm.. lab 3?) and it didn't work. -.-;  But at least Allen got it to function after some.. er.. wire tweaking.  I'm going to go draw out Lab 18 and 19 later as further forms of procrastination, because drawing out diagrams for labs is fun.  =D   [ NONWESTERN CULTURES IB ~ period two ]  Rainforest conference!  It was stupid and I ended up just defacing the sign.  I 'ave to be a SETTLER.  And then Farr screwed up the seating charts, so she slammed the RANCHERS sign on my desk.  I'm a SETTLER, damn it.  A SETTLER.   [ BIOLOGY IB ~ period three ]  Um.  Sponges.  Yes.  I fell asleep.  On accident, I swear.  And then I woke up and took notes, but people copied from my notes.  Poo.   [ PHYSICAL EDUCATION ~ period four ]  The PE classes swam today, only I couldn't because... yes, that.  Anyhow, so I walked around the pool for the entire period and got funny looks.  But an awful lot of people forgot their swimming stuff, so I was nowhere near being alone.  =)  That was pretty cool.  I lapped a few people six times, and we weren't even running or anything.  It's amazing how slowly people walk now.  Um, yes.  Now I have to write a two page, single-spaced, Times New Roman, twelve-point, half-inch margin essay on the importance of physical education.  Homer is such a twit.   [ LUNCH ]  AAAAARGH.  Sheila, Cristina, and Emily spent FOREVER changing after the swimming thing, so we were beyond uberlate for the Anime Club meeting.  Which turned out to be  fine , because the morons (Stupid Caitlin.) decided to watch  Inuyasha .  You shoulda seen me twitch.   [ LATIN ~ period five ]  I have come to the sound conclusion that the writers of our textbook are sheltered, archaic human beings.  There is more innuendo in this thing than in Iowa's cornfields.  Because, no, they cannot wave spears or pitchforks like any other mobs, they must wave  rods  and  sticks .  And slave girls please people an awful lot.  I'm quite sure they only mean "delighted," though, judging by the-- [cringe] illustrations.  Still.  Innuendo abound.    Next thing you know we'll learn Latin for "petting" and the book'll be full of it.  By the way, the most common "insulting" phrase in the book?   I don't give a hoot about--    [ ENGLISH ~ period six ]  Romeo and Juliet will  burn .  Summed up nicely by Elyse: "I think Rosaline should've killed Romeo and then tricked Juliet into falling off a cliff."  There ya go.  Romeo and Juliet= SOLVED!  Ya think maybe the nun Ran bribed at the end of  Gluhen  is Rosaline?  (Dude, it's workable.  I mean... hello?  Weiss?  Plot hole!)

       mehful.  NEED SLEEP.  NO SLEEP NOT GOOD.  Catnaps rock my SHOELACES, Elfie.  Yes.  Shoelaces.  Hm....what happened today?  Ionno.  YOU tell ME.  Period 0 -- Biology H: Hmmm....Adams wasn't there....YEAH CAMPOS!!!!  CHIPMUNK, BABY!!!  So yeah.  Stacy subbed....took the test, which I actually DIDN'T FAIL, POOP!  Proud, you must be.  Anyhoo.  Yeah.  Nothin much.  Sat there and chilled after the test.  Period 1 -- English 1H: So Dahlberg was still here....ditching jury duty...i TOLD him.  Just tell them you're a misanthrope, you hate the world, and you're a white supremacist.  The wouldn't dare put you on the jury.  But no.  He chose to not listen to me POO.  I WANNA WATCH THE MOVIE.  Yeah, what did we do?  Oh yeah.  R&J.  Stupid thing.  Period 2 -- Ceramics: Nothing.  NOTHING.  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  Period 3 -- Algebra 2H: We had an explore today....something about ellipses....but Jessica can't be sure.  There was a JELLYBEAN.  It ATTACKED my eye.  My EYE.  It ATTACKED it.  STUPID AARON.  I DUNNO WHAT FLAVOR IT WAS...butthead.  Period 4 -- Drama: Ehh....THE JELLYBEAN WAS STILL ATTACKING MY EYE.  I was going to name it, but then I decided it wasn't nice enough to be named.  *nods*  Our scene goes up tomorrow....AIYAH.  We screwed.  Lunch: Jessica had to miss LUNCH for Speech Club meeting....eh.  Jessica didn't eat breakfast and didn't eat lunch either.  Well, not until the bell rang and Jessica ran and got a hotpocket....well, monkey gave me a sugar cookie.  Period 5 -- World History H: Took MORE boring ass notes.  OMFG those notes SUCK.  OMG and then Stefanie Wang stole my cookie....*tear*  yeah yeah.  Period 6 -- Basketball: Finished state physical fitness testing....what a PAIN.  lalalala 21 GODDAMN INCHES FOR TRUNK LIFT, BABY!!!  HELL YEAH.  Then we shot around....my shot died.  hahaha then we did transition.  Jessica had a crick in her back the WHOLE DAMN TIME.  It's still not gone.  What a bitch.  Later: Went to Stef's house....watched Friends, then SpongeBob, then Sabrina, ate mac & cheese with jody, watched Stef kill herself with her grilled-cheese sandwich, slept.  For like 20 minutes.  Then Jessica's dad came.  TIRED.  HOMEWORK.  SLEEP.

      j0.  I'm tired.  x______-  I also feel a bit out of it.  :(  :(  Which means not good, if you are not skilled in the art of interpretation.   [music]   BoA - The Lights of Seoul (Korean)  [food]  APPLES!   [ HONORS GEOMETRY &raquo; period 0 ]  We got our tests back and I didn't have any questions, so I promptly fell asleep.  Funny how she always catches the people around me sleeping but never me.  I think it's reflected in my citizenship grade.  ._.   [ ICT &raquo; period 1 ]  Holy crap, I feel like such a dumbass right now.  x.x;  Being the retarded fuck that I am, I failed the counter test.  I don't know..  how , but I did.  Aced the JK flip flop and shift register tests, though.  Aa.  And then I just.. stood there while other people went to do labs.  Oh, and I just realized that Atlantis Princess is one of BoA's Korean albums.  Oo;  No, this did not happen in ICT.  This just happens to be where I am in the text box.   [ NONWESTERN CULTURES IB &raquo; period 2 ]  Uhhhh.  Errrrr.  I don't remember what happened in this class, except that it was awfully boring.  I think we looked at pictures of Ms. Farr in Cuba, but don't quote me on it.   [ BIOLOGY HONORS/IB &raquo; period 3 ]  AHAHA.  We finished  Incredible Suckers .  This would be my... third time seeing that movie.  The first time was with Collins in seventh grade and the second was in deHaas, same grade.  Lack of communication betwixt teachers, man.   [ PHYSICAL EDUCATION &raquo; period 4]  Ack.  We played basketball and LOST for the first time since the beginning of the semester.  Of course, the twits had an uber-tall sophomore on their team, so I suppose that was the cause...?  In any case, we (Emily, Sheila, Cristina, Shannon, me) suffered defeat.  x_O;  I don't really mind, though, seeing as they had a huge advantage over us.   [ LATIN &raquo; period 5]  I don't like this class.  x___x;  That is all.   [ ENGLISH &raquo; period 6 ]  ... and I hate Romeo and Juliet.  Really, I do.

ALL OF YOU scoffed at least a couple of times.  OMG WHERE'S STEF?!?!  HELL YEAh.  YOU. ALL. SUCK.  Now watch.  Everyone's going to love him now just because he made that shot.  Y'all just jumping on the bandwagon.  Bastards.  WAHAHAHAHA.  NOthing in my brain 'cept that right now.  Well, nothing in my brain period.  Oh well.  I'm ECSTATIC.

HONORS GEOMETRY - Period 0  Omfg.  I aced a geometry test.  =3 =3 =3  Seeing as I suck at geometry, I find that so incredibly awesome.  97/97, man.  Ze possums.  Then again, it was an Algebra-based chapter.      ICT - Period 1  Oh, bloody HELL.  First I'd like to profusely thank anyone patient enough to help us with Lab 16 (including but possibly not limited to Sharragh [sp?  Thanks for telling me that it was wired correctly the... second time I wired it, lol.  -.-;], Alvin [Encouragement my ASS, An.  All he really did was point out I was staring at the JK flipflop diagram instead of the D one.  Whoops.], Richard [who wired the entire thing only to get bitchslapped by An, poor baby     NONWESTERN CULTURES IB - Period 2   Mm, debates.  Failed the reading quiz because I didn't feel like reading.  Yesyes.  Then we had the debate thing and Rachel drew on the label.  And I just sat there.   BIOLOGY HONORS/IB - Period 3   Hm, we watched the rest of  Osmosis Jones .  It was boring.  And then he posted grades, but I didn't feel like getting clobbered and pushed and mutilated, so I didn't check mine.  Boo-hoo.   PE - Period 4   Homer's leaving this year, so he's skipping a bunch of days for his "vacation."  And we had COACH GARLAND for a sub.  It was horrible.  Played softball and won 6-4.  I struck out for the first time this semester. o_o;  Ow, my tailbone.   LUNCH   Sat in the Bio room and went crazy.  Cristina told me to study for the Latin test.  I said no.  BWAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAaa.   LATIN - Period 5   Ugh, testing all period.  xx;;;  We had a 66-question multiple choice part and a separate translation set of problems.  Took me a while, but I finished.  :3  Aced the multiple choice (Minus 1, woohoo!), not sure about the second part because it hasn't been graded yet.  Hn.  And Cristina told me to STUDY.  Study?  Latin?  BULLSHIT.   ENGLISH - Period 6   MWAHAHAHAHA.  I was still wired from lunch, honestly.  All that bottled up energy from Latin exploded at the start of English, heh.  Ask anyone who was there earlier (Shannon).  I bounced around the desks and crashed into stuff.  Oh yeesssss.  And later I was doing a sandwich bag dance, but that's an entirely different story.  XD  Well, so, we had our presentation thing, and J.R. got confused since apparently Daniel didn't do sufficient research on the Globe Theater.  So Lewis had to finish our presentation for us.  XD  Was quite sad, really.  The skit was stupid because Brian was filling in and kept reading things wrong.  -.-;  [jabs him]  I ended up laughing way more than I should've and the entire thing just made no sense.  I didn't do a great dying job, either, but I didn't feel like whamming my head against the computer like Mudasir did.  xP

       Lalala...meh.  ankle is in pain.  look like blimp, it do.  Hm...can't remember all the way back.  Maybe Saturday might work.  [Saturday]: Class in the morning...then Little Stars.  Stupid Jody wasn't THERE...so Jessica had to ask Mr. Iwanmoto for a ride home.  *hmph*  Stupid stupid stupid thing.  Aiyah.  Hauled my ass back to class and then went to Mervyn's and bought spazzy orange sandals that I think my mommy really wants me to wear *silly grin*.  Practice.  Practice was actually OK, seeing as Stacey wasn't there and Trish ran practice and we didn't completely die on the second lay-up run we did.  We shot for about half the time and then Trish's friend came and then we broke into groups and did pick and roll.  AGAIN.  Then Daphne came after we were running plays and then we scrimmaged and we WON.  Free throws died.  Went home.  Tired.  Slept.  Showered.  Yeah.  Don't remember no more.  [Sunday]: 12:30 game so I couldn't watch the damned LAKER GAME IN WHICH THEY COMPLETELY KILLED, RIGHT STEF?  But anyhow.  We got there and then we found out who Laura really hated because apparently that girl wouldn't let her play TAG with them when they were like 5 in girl scouts...LOL.  So yeah.  I play like shit in the first half and so Stacey sits me for about 9 mintues....poopers.  So we're up by two at halftime and then we get back in there for the second half and like three seconds into the half I get the ball in the corner and I launch the three and I don't remember if it does in, but I think it did, and Jessica lands on this stupid girl;s foot and it rolled like REALLY REALLY far down.  platypus has to sit again and then pulled her shoelace so tight her foot started losing circulation.  So she goes back in against Trish's advice and we go into overtime.  The tip was weird; Salena tapped it back and so JEssica goes to get it and someone beats her there and then Jessica tries to get the ball back and they get an easy layup oops.  LOL. But it's okay becaus ethen I beat their damn press down the court and Salena made the layup HA.  Hahahaha USHI, GOOD JOB, man!  She completely shut down their point guards.  Stupid press.  I HATE THEIR PReSS.  But you know what?  WE BROKE IT HA!  Hahahaha.  So yeah.  So then like a minute left and stupdi ref calls a foul on me....I DIDN'T TOUCH HER YOU BLINDASS.  But it's okay because she only made one and JEssica pushed that damn ball up the court and completely launched it up the court to Christina who stopped for the jump shot and I was thinking, "OH HELL NO TAKE THE GODDAMN LAYUP!!!!"  and then I see it go in and I'm all jumping up and down.  You don't understand.  Christina has NEVER made a shot off one of my passes and she FINALLY lemme have an assist, AND it was the game-winning assist.  WOW OCO was dumb...they were down by 1 and htere were only 5 seconds left, HELLO?  TIME OUT?  Or at least don't stand there holding the ball....but it's ok I was happy.  STACEY DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY OMG OMG OMG.  Then she told me I needed a new ankle brace *no, i hadn';t figure it out yet....i'm just slow like that*.  BUT THEN MR. BALDERRAMA came over and started talking to them and STACEY NEVER TOLD ME WHAT KIND OF ANKLE BRACE TO GET!!!!  AIYAH.  OH well I'll get it Saturday after practice.  Kekeke it looked like a BAWOON at the end of the day on the pillow.  HEHEHE.  [Monday]: Lalalal too tired to talk.  BUT in 6th period, stupid BaDmInTOn stole the stupid gym so we were stuck outside and then Ed tells us that the freshman are runnign the mile this week and Jessica is stuck thinking, "WHY THIS WEEK?  HUH?  I ASK YOU.  THE ONE WEEK....nevermind."  So yeah.  Hahaha Stef don't it suck having a brain?  XDDD.  Jessica ended up running.  BAD MOVE.  Jessica just chugged a BIG can of soda during 5th period and had to PEE the whole time.  And when she started the mile, she extended her ankle and it pulled AIYAH.  Ended up with 8:11....not bad considereing on the last lap I could feel the ankle just about popping every time I landed....TIRED WANNA SLEEP NIGHT.  ~PLATYPUS  and NO.  SUPERMAN.

       Wowsers.  Lots and lots and lots of stuffs happened.    [Friday]: Meh.  We finished STAR testing, blah blah blah.  NO MORE FOR ANOTHER YEAR!!!  Stupid thing.  OMG I finished the math test in 8 minutes.  THe science one took 11 because I was trying to decide which way the wind blew.  Meh.  So after school Rose kinapped us and took us to her house.  So it turned out Daphne was acutally at home....haha.  She told Rose never to bring home stray animals and whatnot.  Haha.  We played CARDS!!!  ROSE SUCKS!!!  Well, she sucks at everything but GoFish.  LOL.  JODY LOST EVERYTHING.  We had a balloon fight too!  XDDD  It was AWESOME.  Then we were talking with Mrs. Casuco and she COMPARED ME TO STACEY.  Even Daph was completely shocked.  LOL it was weird.  Then Daph took me and Jody to Wilson because Jody's mom was picking us up there...she made me sit in the FRONT.  Then she was going on about how the tires were all messed up so if something happened it wasn't her fault....which was REALLY REALLY comforting.  She said she was going to go to practice....LIAR.  [Saturday]: Oiii.  Saturday sucked.  So I had math class at 830 in the morning until 930....then went to Lil Stars practice.  Kelli called me a sleepyhead because I got there later....the butthead.  Then Poop took me home and told me she beat Wart Hog, which I WILL DO, POOP.  Then I went to math AGAIN from 1 until 2 and we got stuck in traffic.  Mommy wanted to go to Target and Mervyn's, and the nice, awesomeful PLatypus gave her permission....haha.  So I got to practice about 2:58.  Then me and Cat went to the potty room and stalled for time.  STACEY WAS LATE!!!  Haha.    We did layups and four crazy eights....my BACK HURTS.  Then we did crossovers and defense on dribbler.  STUPID USHI.  I'm MAD AT HER.  She wasn't there, so I got stuck with TRISHA!!!!  STUPID USHI!!!  *hmph*  THen we did the poophead defensive patter thing!!!!  Oiii.  Then Trisha said my head was on sideways...XDDD.  STacey got mad at us because we hadn't done it in so long that we were messing it up and everything.  We did it for about 30 minutes!!!  Crazy.  Then we all just sat and talked.  That was fun.  *doublenod*  THen we broke into groups.  Trish was in a GOOD mood yesterday!!!!  Hahaha.  She had to explain everything in math terms for Christina to understand....o.O  Hhhahaah.  THen we played the shooting game.  THAT WAS AWESOMEFUL FUN.  Me and Trisha were trash talking the WHOLE TIME.  Hhahaha.  My team won the first two competitions, and then Trisha's team won the second two.  We had to shoot free throws for the tie breaker.  WE WON.  HECK YEAH, TRISH!!!!  LOL.  It was FUN.  She was in a GOOD MOOD.  She's so awesome when she's in a good mood.  Hahaha.  Then practice was over and they had their parent's meeting for about 30 minutes....we ran outta things to talk aobut.  We ended up playing knock out.  Meh.  I was all tired again.  *hmph*  STUPID STEPH....suggesting KnockOut in the first place...lol.  Then Jody and Jaimie came over to go swimming, and I didn't even go because I was making CHICKEN DOGS....yeah.  I slept at 930.....WOOOOOT!!!!  It felt awesomeful.

      Er.  AX is in two days, and nothing is finalized yet.  God, I hope it gets finalized damn soon.  Or I'll be there.  Alone.  Well, not really.  I'll probably have to go with just Vanessa, though.  oO;  Which would be odd, because we'd originally planned for five people.  Anyway, this will probably be my last post until after AX.  :)  It all depends on how things work out, though.  We shall see.  The last time I posted was Saturday, so I'll... fill you in?  If I can remember.  On Sunday I distinctly remember doing absolutely nothing.  On Monday I did nothing.  On Tuesday, I went to chem.  It was easy.  Frighteningly so.  Today, I (big surprise) did nothing.  There is NOTHING to do.  God.

      Oiii.  I'm sick.  I have a MAJOR headache.  Ohhhh dear.  Not good.  Pounding, throbbing head right now....DAMMIT.  Let's see....did nothing until about 2 in the afternoon when we left to pick up Judy and Jody for our game...  [Laura, jo-D, and Jess]: So we played at 3 today...and it wasn't a particularly nice game, either.  Hahaha first play of the game...I blow a HUGE, WIDE-OPEN layup.  BUT Stacey wasn't THERE!!!  Wahaha.  She got there about 30 seconds after.  Ahahaha.  WOO HOOO!!!  Well, Mrs. Higashi told Stace anyway.  Poooooo.  Yeah.  Crap I played like shit.  My free throws died.  I got hit on a three-pointer so I got three free throws...and I missed all three.  I rebounded the last miss and put it back, though.  Hmm.  Then got fouled and went BACK to the line for another two shots.  Missed them, too.  Fouled again.  Back to the line.  Missed both again.  Then, FINALLY, with about 6 seconds left, I FINALLLLY make two free throws.  Not like they helped.  We lost, 25-17.  DAMMIT.  We placed SIXTH.   [Steph]: Hmmm....Steph played Azusa High...the shit ass team we played yesterday.  Ehhh they lost, too.  Arg that number 11 pisses me off SOOOOO bad.  ARG.  Ahaha Stace was talking to the Rowland coach and Lindsay at the scorer's table during Steph's game...and then during halftime, Stace heads over to where me, Ushi, and jo-D are sitting.  Ahahaha I ran into a corner and just hid.  Then Stace came over and I tried to run away, but it didn't work.  Awww.  Ahaha oh well Steph did well!!!    [Cat]: Ahahah they played their own freshmen and LOST.  That was pretty funny.  Hahaha their huddle was like, "Execute!!" and the freshmen said, "Freshmen!" everytime...it was funny.  AHAHAHAHA they LOST to their OWN FRESHMEN.  That was pretty funny.  [Nemo]: Championship game, d00d.  Aahaha Stace used my towel to wipe off her DIRTY CAN OF SODA....psh.  Hahaha I was on the floor for their whole game...I was completely sandwiched between Stacey and Catherine.  Hahaha.  Awww Stace kept making fun of me...hahaha.  Hmm.  Hahahha our freshmen got ALL PISSED OFF at Glendora...I think Roxanne was T-ed up.  Not sure....we all missed it, and the next thing we saw was Roxanne making straight for this one girl....hahaha.  Yeah, well, Nemo made TWO left-handed layups et squee!!!  She missed her free throws though.  Oiii she aired one too.  hahaa.  She fouled out, too.  Catherine Chang missed a 3 at the end to win it...they lost by two.  Oiiii MY HEAD HURTS.  NEED TYLENOL OR MOTRIN OR SOMETHING!!!

      Whoa....Ima le tired.  Hahaha.  So the freshmen won today at 9...woOohoOoOo GO NEMO!!!!  But we lost.  Hahaha.  We played Glendora.  They weren't exactly that great...but, uh, BIG WHITE GIRLS again.  WHY?  WHY?  EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  They just HAVE to be the big white girls.  oO;;  HAHAHAH keeps reminding me of the Upland girls we played in 7th grade for NJB.  Except...they were big, BLACK girls....not to be racist or anything, of course.  Pffft.  Ehhh...but we missed like 2,564,522 layups...and had even more turnovers...so the thing me and Erika came up with is that we didn't technically LOSE to the OTHER TEAM....we beat OURSELVES.  OH OH OH WHO'S GOOD....BOO-YAH!!! HAHAHA.  Anyhoo.  Freshies won their second game too....CHAMPIONSHIPS TOMORROW FOR THE ICKLE FRESHIES GO NEMO!!!  WOO HOOOOOO!!!  Anyway.  We played Azusa High.....THOSE SHITHEADS....seriously.  Wanna know how bad they are?  Holy shiznits they come in right after Garey.  Ohhhhhhhhh yes.  THEY SMELL.  Hmmm.  They're not very nice.  We beat the living shit outta them though.  Pooo head.  So yeah.  Hahaha.  Um....we WERE gonna go out to eat...but jo-D ditched us for her mom's something or another...and then me and nemo and laura couldn't decide on where to go out to eat...and ushi didn't wanna call catherine up...STUPID USHI COW!!!  hahahaha.  And that's about it.  We play at 3 tomorrow for FIFTH FRIKKIN PLACE...BLAH.  Hey...if the freshmen beat the team we lost to....they place first...but that would NOT be a nice thing for us...haha lol.

      Haha, I mean the Japanese band/singer/whatever, not the subject.  I've always been under the impression that Chemistry was a female artist because m-flo usually collaborates with females, or at least in my meager experience.  ^^;  Anyway.  I'm bored and boring.  Really.  I have done absolutely  nothing  worth writing about all week.  Well, a few things are quite possibly a little bit interesting, but I highly doubt anyone'd be interested.  Not like I write this for  your  entertainment, so I'm telling y'all anyway.  Go ahead and skip to Platypus' post if you think I'm boring.  Nyah.  I don't remember what I did Tuesday, so it must've been quite drab.  Wednesday's also kinda fuzzy in my memory, so I'm skipping that too.  On Thursday, we went to Life Plaza and returned TRC and xxxHolic.  :(  Then I wasted a whole bunch of time looking for  Wei&szlig; Side B , which they didn't have.  I ended up getting volumes 12 and 14 of  Fruits Basket , 4 and 5 of  Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE , and 1 and 2 of  Tokyo Babylon .  Squee; I have stuff to read!  =)  Oh, and then Hannah came over at around 6:30.  We played DDR, I "worked on" chemistry homework, and then we just were stupid insomniacs for the rest of the night until around 1:30 AM or so, when we slept.  Heh.  Doggies.  On Friday, my mother and I went to the mall (EW I KNOW).  I had to eat lunch at that Lucky Bowl thing, and really, their noodlies weren't bad for fake Chinese food.  Then we went to Old Navy to see if they had any happy white jeans I could wear for my Touya cosplay at AX, but they didn't have anything that I liked.  So we went to that animation store place and looked for presents for this five year old for his birthday.  They had .hack and Lain wallscrolls!  And Gluhen OSTs!  I would've gotten them if AX wasn't coming up.  ^^;  Then we went to Michaels and got white and black bandanas and a black apron for aforementioned Touya cosplay.  :]  I also got these REALLY PRETTY fireworks-type sparkly things to put on my door because I'm just weird like that.  And I thought they were pretty, because they ARE.  Deal with it.  Today, I had to go to piano lessons.  Oh my GOD, my fingers were killing me.  It was the same as last Monday; I had to pound the effing piano.  Luckily I think my fingers are slightly less weak than before since I spend so much time typing on the computer nowadays.  After that, mum took me home and I had to eat this convoluted Chinese crap that looked like it was run through some.. shredder of some sort.  I ate an awful lot of spicy tofu (I don't know the English name.  Sue me.) because it was the only thing that looked edible.  It was goooood.  My brother got mad at me because I put the spicy tofu sauce in his rice to torture his poor, sensitive taste buds.  Then mother dear dragged me to Frances' family's barbecue thing, which was funny.  Eric was going around with his shirt off and Florence and Grace were trying to make him put one on.  It was hilarious.   Grace:   Put a shirt on, you showoff.  Eric:   Why should I?  Florence:  Look, even your friend is wearing a shirt.  Eric:  So? ...  Eric:   Hey, Vanessa, want a cheeseburger?  Vanessa:   No.  I'm cool because I actually  ate  the food your parents cooked.  Eric:  Fine, your problem. ...  Eric:  [claps]  Get me ketchup.  Grace:   Excuse me?  Eric:   Give me ketchup.  Grace:   No.  Eric:   Give me ketchup.  Florence:   When you  clap  at me?  No.  Eric:  Frances, get me ketchup.  You're standing right next to it!  Florence:   No, Frances, don't do it!  Eric:  Please?  Hey, look, it's not even for me!  It's for Richard!  Grace:   No, Frances, don't give it to him!  Eric:   It's for Rich, not me!  Richard:  ...  Frances:  [walks away from ketchup]  Grace:   HAHA!  Get your own damn ketchup!  Yeah.  And then we left, because I had this throbbing headache and my brother was being an asshole.  He told Florence he was going to crash open her leg or something, and my mom went ballistic on him.  It was scary.  So when I got home, I applied for the Don McLean fanlisting.  :P  And I'm about to go beddie bye; I need it.  :'(

      Whoa I actually have something to blog about.....holy son of a cow.  [Wednesday]: Hmmm did NOTHING for the first....um...*counts on fingers* 10 HOURS!!!  Hahah and then Jody calls and then Jody and the Poop and Jaimie come over to play Super Mario Sunshine....I HATE that game.  It MADE FUN OF ME!!!!  BOOOO.  Hahaa I was shooting at this one Pirahna Plant...and this message pops up and goes, "Your attacks seem to be having no effect.  Perhaps you should try to aim."  I WAS LIKE...."EXCUSE ME!??!?!?!"  Hahahaha.  Anyway.  They leave and go home for dinner and destroy my day of actually doing something...hahaha.  [Thursday]: Hmmm.  I don't think I did anything until 1:15-ish...then Jody came and picked me up and then we went and got Ushi.  Hahaha we passed by a bunch of firefighters doing their "Fill the Boot" thing...I thought they were selling something...I was like, "Wow, I wonder what they're selling this time..."  Hahaha.  OMG haha My life goal is to climb one of those ladder things...hahaha.  Anyway.  We played Rowland...and...they...weren't. that. good.  The final score was like 37-11 or something like that.  Fun.  Then we had practice from 5-6..."ran over plays".  Haha me and Laura shot around for an hour.  [Friday]: Ehhh.  Left at 11:20 to go to the movies with jo-D and Ushi....Nemo ticked off her mom yesterday and couldn't go.  Hahaha lol LOSER.  Anyway.  Watched Dodgeball....wow that movie was kinda perverted.  LOL.  And we happened to take Jaimie along...oO;;;  Hahahaha.  That was funny.  Pretty funny shiznit, though.  Hahaha.  Then we went to LA to watch Nemo and the freshmen play...they killed Steph's LA squad...WOOT WOOOT!!  LOL.  Hahaa and then we were going to stay until our game started at 6..but then Steph's mom offered us a ride home.  Hahaha so me, Ushi, and jo-D stayed at my house for like half an hour...and then Mrs. Higashi picked us up for our game.  HAHAHA WE KILLED THEM!!!  It was like playing WOrkman all over again...last year we beat 'em 58-8, and we beat LA today 58-8.  Hahaha.  It was REALLLY fun.  Kinda mean, I know.  Hahha the score at the half was 22-1.  HAHAHA me and Erika had this thing where we said they wouldn't score more than 3 points the entire game...she said two, but I was smarter.  Hahaha.  So then this one girl FINALLY makes a shot with about 11 minutes left...hahaha.  ALL the shots they throw up there that hit the rim had me and Erika ALLL worried...and when that one girl scored a basket to make it 5 points...we almost cried...lol.  Hahaha.  And then their last basket came on a 3-pointer....but she was clearly STEPPING OVER THE LINE...and ED WAS RIGHT THERE...but I think he just gave it to her...lol.  Haha and then me and jo-D and Ushi were gonna go out for dinner, but my dad was being a butthead and we didn't.  End of story WOO HOO!  Oh yeah.  We play at 12 tomorrow, and if we win, we play at 3 against CATHERINE and WALNUT...and if we lose....iono who we play, but we'd play at 5.  Yeah.  Anyhoo.  Ima gone BYE BYE!!

      Awww I'm TIRED.  It's uberfantastically hot in my room.  Iono why.  It was only about 70 degrees today..*is confuzzled*  Anyhoo.  Hmmm.  Let's see.  Yeah.  So my mom dropped me off at BIG TOE's house around 7:35 this morning...and then Mrs. BIG TOE took me and BIG TOE to Wilson to get our books for stupid AP Euro...yes, Charlotte, we have summer homework, now SHATTUP!!!  Haha and then we walked down to ASB to get cleared.  Well, in my case, I fell down the stairs....I CANNOT GO DOWN STAIRS.  IT HURTS TOO FSCKING BAD.  Stupid BIG TOE just ran faster and faster down the stairs...you SMELL!!!  Hahaha.  So the nice ASB man gave us our clearances....and then we decided to go and walk back to stef's house...so we did.  And then Jessica died again on the way down Halliburton and Stef's street...and we're gonna get a custom designed orange-and-purple termite tent...hahah.  Yeah.  So then we watched GoodBurger and I fell asleep.  Haha.  Then I jaywalked across Halliburton and walked home.  Then I sat here and watched TV and did NOTHING.  And there's my story.  *applause*  SORRY ELFIE!  =D

      Argh, Barney came today.  ;.;  By the way, I'm going to bed when I finish this.  I'm waiting for my accursed hair to dry (it takes FOREVER).  So, lessee.  I woke up at nine and ate cereal and a plum for breakfast.  How exciting.  Then mum made me go to piano lessons, which was veritable hell.  My piano teacher's favorite composer is Czerny.  Efrehofhsdkjvn.  She is now officially going to try and make every single one of my fingers just as strong as the others.  It huuuuurts.  I am so serious.  You try pounding your way through a six-page Czerny etude three times all at the loudest you can possibly do.  Curse you, Advanced Level.  After piano lessons, we (My mother, Jessica, and Michael) went back to my house.  Jessica, Michael, me, and my grandma played mah jongg for a few hours.  My luck has been... really bad.  Every time I get this freakishly good hand, someone wins before I can.  And every time I win, I get the lowest amount of points possible (one flower; one word).  Everything sounds better in Chinese.  D'oh.  But mah jongg was SOFUN.  I can't even say what happened, because it won't make any sense in English.  Nyeh.  ;.;  Anyway, after that, my mom started playing for a couple hours.  Then we played two games of Life (Yeah, I knoooow.) and Othello.  Then they left.  So after that we went to Olive Garden (my mum, grandma, brother, me).  I saw someone from Troy there.  He was in my ICT class, but I don't remember his name.  Boythatsucks.

      And they're freaking spiffy Costco socks, too, remember?  =D  Yeah, drunk!Fye pwnz.  When Fye's drunk, he goes nuts and acts like a cat.  It's adorable, and CLAMP draws him with flowers floating around.  Fye's just so cool.  Syaoran's deranged when he's drunk (He was attacking a chair with a soup ladle, glint in eye), Sakura's ditsy, Mokona's just Mokona on crack, and Kurogane doesn't  do  drunk.  I've really been reading too much TRC (Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE for the abbreviation inept, right Platypus?).  But it's just so cute and awesome and stuff.    Okay, I'll get to the blog part now, heh.  On Friday, Jessica, Jessica, and Michael came over to play mah jongg.  =3  Platypus LOST, Pumpkin LOST, and Michael won (!!).  I won by like.. 12.  He won by 50+.  Publications brat.  XD~  Just kidding.  Then Platypus left, so Jessica, Michael, and I played about three games of Life.  Then we played mah jongg again, and my mum took Platypus' place.  =D  Afterwards we went over to the Glorystar (choir) end of the year celebration.  I got the travel type Scrabble, so we played on the way there, all the time that we were there, and on the way back.  It was great.  On Saturday, I stayed at home and did almost nothing.  I seem to recall that we went to the park, and that I taught my mother how to swing.  ^-^  On Sunday, which was today, I really did nothing.  Except the crap on my to-do list, but that stuff's boring.  What was weird, though, was that  Chicken  Eric IMed me in the morning.  All  s he said was "u r an idiot."  Dubbul-yu tee eff.

       Watch me wrap up what happened this week in three words.  Nothing, basketball, nothing.  LOOK LOOK LOOK I DID IT WOOOT!  Hmmm.  Let's see.  Aside from summer camp, all Jessica did was sit at home and watch TV!!!  Well, actually, no.  I lied.  Went to the elf's house on Friday to play mahjong with her and Pumpkin and Pumpkin's brother.  I lost!!!  For the first time in like, um, 6 months or so?  Wait, no, FIVE.  *nodnod*  I lost playing with my aunt and grandparents the last day of winter vacation.  awww  Anyhoo.  Yeah.  Then on Saturday...um...lunch with my aunt and thems....then went to HomeTown with Chicken, Jody, and Chicken's brother.  Haha.  Man, we sat right next to the entrance to the bathrooms...so we were sitting there and looking at all the fascinating people walking, or, in some cases, running, into the bathroom and walking back out....yeah.  And then Chicken decided to randomly call out "PORN STAR".... hahah.  Then Jody and I spent the better half of the rest of dinner just sitting there and laughing at NOTHING.  Absolutely NOTHING.  NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING.  Hahaha.  I told Jody she had to eat six plates of food before we could go...hahaha.  CHEATER.  She only ate 3!!!!  THE HORRIBLE GURGLE!  BAD!!!  Wahaha then we decided to go to Chicken's house to go and play with Albert...so we all crammed into the back of Mr. Chicken's pickup truck...and once again, Jessica was stuck sitting on the stupid crack in the middle.  Wahaha.  My butt now has like 5 different levels...  Then Chicken decides she DID want to have a sleepover....SHE TOLD US SHE DIDN'T WANNA HAVE ONE!!!  So then Poop took me and Jody home to grab our stuffs and we went back to Chicken's smelly house  WE PLAYED CHARADES WITH THE FRIENDS TRIVIA SET....WAHAHHA.  'Twas fun.  Then we decided to go and watch Big Fat Liar, which Chicken *illegally* taped...well, her dad taped it, but whatever.  Chicken fell asleep halfway through, I took little catnaps, and JODY STAYED UP AND WATCHED THE WHOLE THING, THE CRAZYHEAD.  So then after the movie we tried to wake Chicken up, but she just crawled under her blanket...wahahah we ditched her.  So it was like 2:30 when we finally ran into her room and fell asleep....and Jessica woke up 4-ish...or I think it was 4-ish...i was going to go and check the cellie, but I got up and fell back down and decided it was too far and went back to sleep.  Then I woke up at 6...and then I couldn't GO back to sleep because JODY'S STUPID CELL WENT OFF.  HAhaha so I made them pay...I was pulling off their blankets and screaming, "WAKE UPPPPPPP!!!!"  at the top of my lungs...yeah.  Fun.  Then my mom came and Jody came to my house and we went to practice...awww.  Practice wasn't nice today, guys.  Hahaha.  I died 7 times.  Wahaha.  The light was...um...not white.  'Twas ORANGE.  *nodnod*  Yeah so when we were shooting...the basket was swaying back and forth and I thought it was just me and that I was about to die again, but Jody came and told me it was moving!!!  WOO HOOO!  Haha.  THen we went to Chicken's house and then to the mall...woo hoo we ate, of all things, MCDONALD'S.  Haha.  Watched the Terminal...it was okay...the plot line kinda dragged, though.  So then chicken had to leave for her art lessons...and then me and Jody decided to go shopping, which didn't turn out too well and my mom picked us up.  Blah.  And now Jessica is here with her legs cramping up.  Again.  Oiii it hurt when I got outta the theatre seat though... Hahah

      Summer vacation looks briiight.  Oh yes, it shines.  XD  Anyway, I woke up at 8:00 and just sat there reading  The Bonesetter's Daughter  by Amy Tan.  Cleaned up my room a little, but I was mostly reading.  Reading, reading, reading.  I've been doing so much of that lately, it's quite sad.  Afterwards, my mother took me out for lunch at some random restaurant over in Diamond Plaza.  Then we went to Life Plaza (the store, yeah?) and rented six Chinese manga things.  =3   xxxHolic  and  Tsubasa RESERVoir CHRoNiCLE , to be exact.  And oh my god, Fye is the most awesome thing EVER.  [clings onto his tattoo]  Eeee.  Mm, then we went to Costco (yeah, again) and got food and random necessary stuff.  =)  Then we went to Target and got a whole shitload of board games.  Then we went home.  And I read TRC for two hours (OMGFYE!1!!!!1!1one).  Jeez.  I

      Wow, summer vacay is boring.  I woke up at 9:30 (LUXURY) and just sat around at the computer for about three hours.  Then mum took my grandma and I to Souplantation.  Afterwards we went to Target and I got a whole mess of stuff:  new earphones (mine are officially out of commission; they like to transmit static) for my mp3 player, pencils, a couple of notebooks, and a bunch of hairties.  I lost all of mine.  Grr.  I didn't want to go home afterwards because I'd be dead bored again, so my mum took us to Costco.  We got the  Return of the King  DVD (  But then we really had to go home (else we'd go shopping for clothes and I  hate  that), so we came back and I read for a while.  Then I turned in the compy and just interchanged typing and reading whilst listening to my beautiful playlist.  Oh, and I swear I played more Spider Solitaire and Minesweeper today than I've ever played in my entire life combined.  Spider Solitaire was cool.  I won four games in a row all with 111 moves.  It was great.  And then I won with 100 moves and broke my streak.  I really suck at Spider Solitaire, I know.  But the Pumpkin just made me aware of its existence last Sunday, so I have a reason.  I'm so bored.

Haha and so were Kate-lyn (???) and Kyrene...XDD  Haha so we were swimming...and then Kelli decides she wants me to pull her around the pool, so I spend about 5 hours doing that...hahah then we got up and ate...then jumped right back in...bad, I know.  So the second time, all my brother's little friends decided to gang up on me with their lovely water guns...it was 1 on 7....and I STILL beat them.  I only had a gun for about half the time....the other half I was too busyin playing with Kelli and Kyrene and Kate-lyn....hahaha.  i STILL beat them.  It was kinda sad.  None of them could hold their breaths for crap...so I would just pull the gun into the deep end and then pull them down to the bottom...and then they'd let go and the gun would be mine again!!   I'm just TOOO smart.  hahaa.  I was SOOOO tired.  And then Kelli kept wanting to go back in...so we did.  This time I just ignored the idiots.  OoOooOo and and and then we had a WATER BALLOON FIGHT!!!  HAha it was my brother and his stupid ass friends against me and Kelli and Kyrene and Kate-lyn and about 4 other guys my brother's age against my brother and his little groupie...WE WON 9-6!!!  WOOOHOOOO and then I was aiming for this one guy and it bounced OFF HIS LEG and hit this other guy right in the "area"...XDDD  Hahaha it was some funny shit.  Then we sat around and ate...hahah then my dad started squirting me with a stupid water gun...you couldn't expect me just to sit there and take that crap, could you?  I grabbed a balloon and chased him 'round and 'round...ankle and all, and threw it at him...XDDD  it hit his ass.  XDD  It was some funny shit.  hahaha.  he left early.  XDDD  yeah.  oh.  don't go swimming on a sprained ankle.  just...don't.  Hahah oh yeah.  Kelli was leaning over the side to pick up something...and mr. iwanmoto pushed her in the pool...hahahah and she thinks it was me..XDD  anyhoo meesa tired.  shall go.  hahah.  stoled from jody...XDD  TYPE YOUR NAME WITH YOUR:  ELBOW: jesdsloiocxa NOSE: jueswsw9ica  TONGUE: jessica  CHIN: jnmersdsdiucazs FOOT: jedssdxoica  EYES SHUT: jessica  hey...at least they didn't make me type it with my tongue AFTER using my foot...  yes.  that was the Jessica Point of the Day.

      Today was the last day of school.  This would be the fourth time that I'm sad to be leaving an educational institute.  All the other times, I was happy.  How utterly sad.   Preschool.   Don't ask me.  I didn't even know how to speak English then.  Kindergarten.   I... don't remember.  First grade.   Hated school.  Thought my teacher was psycho.  Was *very* glad to leave, but I had to get this huge bearhug first.  That was suffocating.  Second grade.   Really hated school.  The teacher wouldn't let me read in class and thought I was some sort of delinquent that couldn't speak English.  Third grade.   Was glad to leave.  Dur.  Fourth grade:  Ehh... this was grade school.  You're never sad to leave school when you're that young.  Fifth grade  I was actually somewhat excited to go to Mesa, so leaving Grazide had no qualms.  Sixth grade.  Crap, I was just like "YAY!  SCHOOL'S OVER W00T!"  Fun barbecue, too.  Seventh grade.   I don't really remember, but I don't remember being sad to leave any middle school grade.  Summer school (CS).   Oh crap, I  cried  on the last day.  I think it was because everyone was leaving and only a few people were even coming back, and that day had been the best day EVER.  Frances was staying over that year too and neither of us was very happy.  We'd had a "secret" water balloon fight away from the rest of the school-- just Chris, Mitchell, Jason, Jesse, Kirk, Jessica, Frances, Katherian (I thiiink, though I'm not sure), and me.   CTY 2003.   I didn't want to leave.  I really, really didn't want to.  But that dratted shuttle made me leave at two.  Eighth grade.   I was so sick of the idiots that I'd known since first grade that I was  overjoyed  to leave.  Haha, sorry Platypus.  CTY 2004.   REALLY didn't want to leave.  End of story.  And now, ninth grade.  God, I hate to say this.  Platypus is going to hate me for life (after she finishes pelting me with rocks, stones, shiny things, pointy basketballs, and sledgehammers).  I adore Troy.  For the first time in my life, I actually really like school.  Does this make me a nerd?  Probably.  But hey, CTY and my SAT score has already cemented me as a nerd, so what have I got to lose?  This is going to be the longest summer vacation of my life.  Damn, I wish school started in August.  Okay.  You can all throw rocks at me now.  P.S.  I'm really sorry if I glared at you today; I couldn't bring myself to smile or laugh.  There were so many people I wanted to say goodbye to or at least SMILE at, and I could barely talk.  ;.;  I'm so sorry.

      Wahaha....at James's house right now.   Blah.  WOO HOO WE DIDN'T HAVE ZERO TODAY WOOO HOOOOO!!!  That was the shit.  LOL Ruby's killing James's hair...XDDd    WOO HOO ONE more day of school!!!  HELLLLLL FRIKKIN YEAH!!!   Period 2 -- Ceramics: Wahaahah two hours of frikkin NOTHINGNESS.  We were "cleaning"...for TWO hours...lol.  Me and Ashley almost DIED trying to clean out the foam box....hahaha.  I almost died from the dust alone.  Anyhoo.  Sat there and watched Clean Shave...lol.  It was funny shit.  Rafael kept laughing...funny shit good times good times.  Period 3 -- Algebra 2H: DAMMIT I SOOO BOMBED THIS TEST...but it's all good.  I only need a 69% to pass with an A- YAY!!!  Wahahaah  Anyhoo.  So Jessica didn't remember to write down the binomial frikkin theroem...so they asked Jessica to find the 8th term of the expression (y-2)^14.  Wahahah.  So Jessica sat there and multiplied the WHOLE DAMNED THING out...hahaha.  And THEN, after JEssica's all frikkin pleased as hell about her multiplication capabilites and her ability to force herself through a billion operations, she realizes she multiplied (y+2) fourteen times instead of f***in (y-2) so she got all pissed off and was really sad.  hahahaha.  I felt like such a retard afterward...wahahah that's funny ass shit though   After school: Wahaha we got out at 12:16 today because of the SUPER FANTASTICAL FINALS SCHEDULE!!!  wahaah so I waited for JAMES WHO TOOK FRIKKIN FOREVER...lol i'm just messin James I still wuv you...HAND!!!  Hahaha.  Anyhoo.  We FINISHED OUR PROJECT AT 3 FRIKKIN-A HELLS YEAH.  hahaha...but then James and I felt "comfortably tired"...hhahah and then I think I fell asleep for like 3 minutes.  XDDD  Hahahaha and now I'm waiting for my lovely daddy to come and get me and SAVE ME FROM JAMES but anyhoo..  Ankle update: It still SUCKS.  I'm mad.  St00pId piece of CwAP!!!  It smells like ROCKS AND SNOT!!  HAHAHAHA.  Anyhoo.  X-rays, d00d!!!  Blah.  All I know is that it still hurts like a mother....and oh yeah.  piece of advice.  DO NOT TRY AND HOP DOWN THE STAIRS WITH A SPRAINED ANKLE WITHOUT YOUR ANKLE BRACE ON....and if you happen to trip, DON'T land on the ankle that died.  hahaha.  But don't worry Jessica was SMART and landed on her OTHER foot!!!!  Just too smart.  XDDD.

      Noooo!  There's only one day of school left!  ONE DAAAY!  (Normally, I'd be happy, but Troy's so CTY-ish this just has to be exception.)  I'm going to miss almost everyone and everything SO FREAKING MUCH.  ;_;  Not funny, dude.  Not funny at ALL.  xx;;;;;  Oh crap, I think I'm going to cry tomorrow.  And I didn't even cry on the last day of eighth grade.  This is saaaad.   Period 0 - Hnrs Geometry  The geometry final was RETARDED.  Yes, it was.  I was one of, oh, five people who actually finished the entire thing.  Which was bullshit, because it was only 50 questions long and it was multiple choice (like everything else).  >>;  I forgot how to do that one question, though.  Oh dear.   Period 2 - Nonwestern Cultures IB  Ee, this test was EASY.  Easypeasyweasy.  Yeah.  Got a 97% because I don't know shit about Mexico.  [uneasy laugh]  Finished a leetle bit too early and took my bookthing to the library.   Period 4 - PE  We had to SWIM.  Westbrook's class got to have a party and we had to swim.  That is just bullshit.  Plus the water was all green and cloudy because there were a horde of little kids swimming in it yesterday.  Ewwwwww.  One guy accidentally swallowed the water and started yelling that it was salty.  Oh.  Dear.  Most of the girls tried to keep their hair dry (me included), but it didn't really work because guys are assholes.  So yeah, my hair was soaking wet.  Not fun.  I dried it with one of those hand drier things, but it didn't really help much.   Period 6 - English  OMFGTHEFINALWASSOHARD.  [dies]  I swear, the only way you can ace that thing is if you have a superultra anal retentive memory and a passion for Shakespeare.  The people in our little corner all finished early, so we went to turn in our textbooks.  Then Swati and Brian decided to ditch class and wouldn't let any of the other of us go in.  xP  Elsa caught Brian and Alex and started yelling at them, so Swati, Andrea, Shannon, and I kinda ran back into the classroom trying not to laugh our asses off.  xD  ((Lewis:  You guys look guilty.  WHAT did you do...?))  Then Brian and Alex came back and were trying not to laugh, and it ended up that the six of us burst out laughing and disrupted the class. XD~  (Which was all good, really)  But DAMN, that final was hard.  xO;  Lewis ran the scantrons through and the highest grade was a 93. (!!  Considering the people in our class, it probably should have been waaay higher.)  I got a 91.  Et squee.  So, yeah.  We're not s'posed to tell the other classes anything about it so I just told Niyati it "wasn't bad, really.  I got an A!"  And failed to mention that very few people did.  School ended at 12:25.  YAY!

      OMFG.  I AM SOOOO PISSED.  On the other hand, though, the Lakers evened the series!!  I have four husbands on that team....XDDD  Fish, Kobe, Malone, and Lukie!  Hahaha.  I'm delusional and lack sleep.  I'm SORRY.   Biology H -- Period 0:  I'm THROUGH with BIOLOGY!!!  HELLLLLL YEAH!!!  NO MORE!!!  Wahahaha.  Jessica got a B on her final without study at all it was GREAT!!!  That leaves Jessica with an A in the class because she ACED her pig practical...which was worth 25% of her grade..WOO HOOO!!  LOVE YOU POOP!!!  Wahahahah!!!  And then we all decided to go early today....so we don't even have to go to zero tomorrow!!  No more BIO!  No more BIO!!  C'mon, chant with me...NO MORE BIO!!!!   English 1H -- Period 1:  OMG Today was Dahlberg's LAST DAY!!!  WEll, with us anyway.  Awwww so we took a 200 question final....and I had just taken the 70-question bio final, but it's all good.  TOO MUCH VOCAB.  THEN ANALOGIES.  THEN ROMEO AND JULIET.  Then like 2 questions on grammar.  IT WAS FSCKIN 23 PAGES LONG!!!  OMG.  Aiyah.  So we spent an hour on it....and the other hour we spent taking pics and everything...hahaha.  Me and Angela had the greatest time messing with John and Mr. Dahlberg...Awww I'm gonna miss teasin them...XDDD   Ceramics -- Period 2:  Sat there with QQ and did NOTHING.  Seriously.  Absolutely NOTHING.  And our final is tomorrow.  Guess what we're doing tomorrow.  We're going to clean the room.  Yeah.  THat's it.  Just that.  And that's our final.  Fun diddly doo.   Algebra 2H -- Period 3:  WOO HOOOOO ALL I NEED IS A 69% on my final to pass with an A in the class!!!  WIOOO HOOOO!!!  Final tomorrow....but it's all good.  Awww....Ima miss all my sophomore buddies...JENNIFER YOU SUCK.  I'm not talking to you....XDDD  But you still have to sign my pages.  XDDD   Drama -- Period 4:  Ehh.  Played Hilarium.  Well, no, eight people did.  The other 20 sat there and did nothing.  I signed autograph pages!  Yeah.  So it's all good.  We're completely through with everything, so we's gonna watch a movie...XDDD  and PAR-TAY!!!   World History H -- Period 5:  Got back the "Last Test"...which I bombed.  AHahaha.  58 of 90.  Not cool.  hahaha.  Yeah well it's all good I have tons of extra credit.  OMG but our stupid final project is due tomorrow...OMFG.  I'm doing like the WHOLE FUCKING THING.  AIYAH.  ARGGG.  What the hell.  Oh well.  It's all good.  FRIKKIN A HAVE TO WRITE THE DAMNED PROCESS PAPER TOO.  WHAT THE FRICK.  SERIOUSLY.  DO SOMETHING!!!   Damn.  Tired as hell.  WOO HOO NO ZERO TOMORROW!  That means an hour's more worth of sleep...

      Owwww.  I just spent five hours studying for finals.  x____x;  It's official.  If I don't pass the English final, I will CRY.  My poor eyes have had enough  Romeo and Juliet  for a life time.  ;_;  And today was bo-ring.  BORING.  YAAAAAAY!  Deluded deluded deluuuuuuuuuded.   ++ Hnrs Gmy  Eh... some crap about some stuff.  Turned in textbooks.  Was all "squee" and stuff in line but not really 'cause I really don't like that one chick that was there.   ++ ICT  Review the ENTIRE PERIOD.  I fell asleep.  I'm really not trying to half-ass this entry.  Really.   ++ History  Review the ENTIRE PERIOD.  Et squee.  I don't remember a single thing-- oh yeah, I signed Caitlin's yearbook.  Scathingly.  And Catherine's.  Not-so-scathingly.  Yay!  >>;   ++ Biology  Eeehh... collected papers for our Chapter 19 packet, then did an attitudinal survey thingamathing.  Yeah.   ++ PE  Homer was here, so we played tennis.  Rallied, actually.  Emily and I played against Sheila, Cristina, and Shannon, but didn't really get much done because Shannon cannot hit to save her life.  HONESTLY.   ++ Lunch  Jonathan made me sign his yearbook.  AGAIN.  "Like a spider."  So I told him to imagine a spiderweb around the words.  And apparently he's going to make me sign it again tomorrow.  ... Great.  Nataya and Emily were helping Sheila take pictures of the Hairy Guy and Mickey Mouse.  Ask no questions and I'll tell you no lies.   ++ Latin  Watched some movie thing.  Jessie liked it. I didn't.  Woohoo!   ++ English  Portfolio assignment.  Whole period.  Andrea writes too fast.  xO;

      OK this is bullshit.  I'm tired, pissed, and in pain.  SOOOO not cool.  So  Sunday  we had practice from 10-12....hahah they ran 9 sets of lines...GOOD JOB YOU GUYS XDDD.  Yeah.  Then they broke into stations and blah blah blah.  Ickle Jessica couldn't MOVE, so she shot around with Daphne instead.  Wahahah Jessica can shoot a free throw left-handed.  Yeah, it looks like shit, but it goes in and that's all that counts...XDDD.  Hahaha.  Then Trisha told Jessica what kind of ankle brace to buy and how to strengthen her ankles.  Wahaha.  I REMEMBER, DAPH!!!  XDD.  So then I came home and then went to James' house to do the stupid history project...and then watched the Lakers lose one of the two games they're giving the Pistons...ohhhh yes.  Then did math homework and notecard....slept at 1230.  Not cool.  So  today :  [Zero]: We decided that we'd all just come early tomorrow and then take the final then and not come on Wednesday or Thursday what FUN!  Hahaha...so we "studied"...wahah Jessica came up with this kick ass thing to remember how light goes through the eye....it goes from the cornea --> aqueous humor --> ver-something body --> retina --> optic nerves transmit to the brain.  OK so when you're a little d00d you go through a ton of corny (cornea) stuff...and then when you get older you go swimming (aqueous) and then you choke underwater and go into a coma and people think it's funny (humor) and then they take your body to the hospital (ver-something body) and then the realize you didn't complete the school year and that you've been retained (retina) and then you realize that they's jackasses and then you wake up (nerve impulses to brain).  HAHAHAH it actually worked for Chicken she remembers the path!!!  I'm so fucking doomed.  [First]: OMG DAHLBERG IS LEAVING.  HE SMELLS.  *hmph*  FINE.  Just KILL it.  But I attacked him with my army of platypi so it's all good.  AND I have his address so we can express mail him our superfantastical movie...XDD. This is one final i CANNOT fail.  [Second]: Senior awards....so all the ickle freshmen stayed in class.  We played cards.  I WON.  WAHAHAHA.  That was some kick ass shit.  [Third]: We reviewed for the final.  Again.  Nicholson was supposed to tell us our grades, but she didn't.  THE LIAR.  HAHAHAAH.  Ima fail this final too.  It's OK, though....because that means I can take it next year with all the rest of them peoples!  [Fourth]: We finished watching all the lip sync things....Boles wrapped up his last year at Wilson...blah blah blah.  [Lunch]: Tried to shove chips into my mouth....hahah if you're not familiar with the game, I hold up a Ruffle for Chicken and Jody to see and then they guess to see whether or not I'll be able to fit that in my mouth...and then I just go with whatever Jody says because Chicken gets second choice and she can't pick the same choice as Jody did.  Hahaha.  [Fifth]: Ehhhh we watched a movie.  Oh we returned our books too blah blah blah.  [Sixth]:  Checked in, walked around with Ushi...then went to James' house to work on the project...took forever to do like 4 slides...but we only have 10 thank God...yeah.  Shit I'm tired.  Night.   Oh yeah.  I forgot to take my pain killers this morning...hahah it HURT.

      Owwww.  I have a stomach cramp or something.  Whatever it is, it hurts like hell.  I'm going to curl up in bed and study for finals while watching  Panyo Panyo Digi Charat  after this.  Just because.  Oh, and KOKIA is really good.  Her voice is really pretty.  [nods]   ++ Hnrs Geometry, Period 0  Eh, we got the aforementioned quizzes back.  And I feel really stupid, because while I've managed to ace all the tests, I got an A- (As in, like, very very borderline A-) on the quiz.  That's just fucking sad, man.  Yeah.  So whilst I wallow in self pity, I give you permission to laugh your ass off at me.  Henceforth commence.   ++ ICT, Period 1  We did nothing except turn in boards and sign yearbooks and talk.  I think I lost my mind in this class or something.  Or An's spazziness rubbed off on me, because I was wired after the period.  Not good.  xP;  Richard thinks I'm psycho/weird and I think he's mad at me.  Ah well.  He doesn't know half of it...   ++ Nonwestern Cultures IB, Period 2  Literally slept almost the entire period, but damn that Canada movie was hilarious.  I signed Dionne's yearbook.  Yaaaay me.  (And I managed to avoid signing Caitlin's yearbook!  Wooooohoooo!)   ++ Biology, Period 3  ... I fell asleep.  I'm SORRY, I didn't mean to!  But I was.. so.. very... tired.   ++ PE, Period 4  Oy, this period was retarded.  Coach Blake was our substitute, and because Westbrook jacked all the basketballs, he told us STORIES.  Waaahoo.  And then we played basketball with volleyballs.   ++ Lunch  Jonathan made me sign his yearbook, and I quote, "like a spider!"  I didn't, of course.  Pssh.   ++ Latin, Period 5  Jeopardy in preparation for the final.  We won.  Yay.  (The questions were stupid.)   ++ English, Period 6  "Portfolio assignment."  Actually, I  think we just mostly did nothing the entire period.  Yeah.  I miss first period.  ;_;

      Elfie!  I DO NOT NEGLECT THE PADDED ROOM!!!  I loves the Room!  I just wish they had offered me Padding for the pooo ankle.  SHIT.  THE PAIN.   [Friday]:  Since my memory doesn't stretch as far back as Thursday, I will start from Friday.  Actually, I don't even remember what happened yesterday....Yeah.    ~ Biology H -- Period 0: ~ Hmm....we had a lecture about immunology...then reviewed for the final.  I gave up.  Piece of crap.  Hahaha.  Anyhoo.  Adams actually let us sign yearbooks the last half of the period OMG.  Campos and I discussed the possiblity that Adams' nice twin was running class....hahaha.  Man, POETRY T-SHIRT D00D.  Adams didn't lemme read my poems!!!  DAMMIT!!! AND jo-D was over until 12:30 in the morning working on that stupid thing but it looked AWESOME.    ~ English 1H -- Period 1: ~ Wooo hooo POEMS!!!  Hahaha I read just about everyone's poems off their shirts...hahah nobody wanted to read theirs.  I sit in the back, so all day Jessica was going from the front of the room to her seat and back to the front of the room and back to her seat and so on.  WOO HOO Angela read Jessica's completely random poem though.  Hahaha.  Then we finished (FINALLY) the DiCaprio version of Romeo and Juliet.  I mean WHAT.THE.HELL did they do?  Ohhhhh well. I don't care.  ~ Ceramics -- Period 2: ~ EHhhh.  I HAVE A B!!!  I CAN GET AN A!!!  IF he decides to be nice and gimme credit...XDDD  ~ Algebra 2H -- Period 3: ~ OMG NOTECARD IS DUE MONDAY.  SHIT.  Ahhh welll.  HAha.  Ummmmm just reviews.  Blah blah blah.  ~ Drama -- PEriod 4: ~ We just sat around and did nothing.  NOTHING AT ALL.  56 minutes of wasted time when I could have been studying, or, better yet, SLEEPING.  ~ Lunch: ~ Diana came up and poked me....So I got her in the salad line.  Then she came and tackled me.  Ran elbow into wall.  OUCHIE.  DIana just about killed me...POO ON YOU.  XDDD LOVE YOU DIANA!!!  ~ World History H -- Period 5: ~ Did debates, failed final.  =(  ~ Basketball -- Period 6: ~ Lalalala.....we warmed up and started doing the transition thingymahoo...on the way back down, lovely-ly stepped on the side of Jenn's foot and popped my ankle.  DAMN THAT SHIT HURT.  Yup.  Iced it.  Had to ditch the history meeting because I couldn't walk to James' house with them...Poop took me home and my dad came back to take me to the doctor's.  THE BAD MAN SAID I CAN'T PLAY FOR TWO TO THREE  WEEKS !!!  W.T.F.  Ehhhh.  ME SAD.   [Saturday]:  Took SAT II...math and bio were easy, but world history SUCKED.  Seriously. I knew like three questions outta the 95.  Hmmmmmm.  Not cool.  SO then after that, Jessica came home.  Jessica slept.  Jessica spent about 4 hours in secession on the phone with Nemo.  Jody and Jaimie and Poop came over to play Mario SUnshine...I fell asleep.  Yeah.  Then I came into my room and fell asleep again.  Hmmm tired.  BYE.  ~ ME.

      I'm so  tired .  I'm just going to finish this blog, take a shower, and go to sleep.  =(  I'm still in a good mood, though.  xP  I'm SO GLAD that it's the weekend.  Teeheee.  [shatters window]   ++ Hnrs Geometry, Period 0  Testu.  I think I failed.  Or aced.  Pick one, any one.  (It was obscenely easy, but I tend to make retarded mistakes when it's obscenely easy.)  Rasch glaaaared at me.  Not like that's anything new, but still.  It's an omen.  I'm going to fail the test!  NOOOOOOO!  I'm being dramatic again.  [shuts up]   ++ ICT, Period 1  Haha... An rocks when we're not doing labs.  I stole her Lab 23 diagram and copied it 'cos I was too lazy to think of one myself.  Then... yeah.  I'm so glad we finished labs last week.  The poor people were running all over the place trying to get all their labs signed.  Then Michael stole the diagram.  Damn you, Michael.   ++ Nonwestern Cultures IB, Period 2  PRESENTATION.  Omfg, the CD I put the powerpoint on was corrupted, so it wouldn't open.  Thank the Lord that I'm paranoid as anything.  I'd uploaded the presentation to six different webservers (Y'know, just in case five of them were down--) and two e-mail accounts, so I just downloaded it off of S-A.net.  People liked my pretty background, woohoo!  =D  And Rachel's daddy's sushi was loved.  The video was dumb, though.  Our lame little jokes were too subtle for anyone to notice.  Mmmffpphh.   ++ Hnrs Biology IB  70.  Fscking.  Minutes.  Of.  Bio.  And Kirkpatrick kept looking my way so I couldn't exactly sleep, either.  I *was* getting rather tired, though.  And Jazzy fell asleep.  Bad Jazzy.   ++ Assembly:  Video Yearbook  Damn, mandatory assembly.  We watched the video yearbook (which was absolutely priceless).  Quoth Ms. Lewis:  "I will never look at Mr. D'Amelia (vice principal) the same way again."  It was a play on both the  Godfather  and  The Lord of the Rings  with all the sports highlights pushed in randomly.  God, it was great.  They showed footage of our class (sixth period English) waving.  W00t.  Nobody could see me 'cause I had decided to hide behind Jessie.  Oh, and this is random, but every single time I use an English phrase in the pluperfect tense, my mind automatically translates it to Latin.   ++ PE  Basketball.  Me and Sheila pitted against Cristina, Emily, and Shannon.  We won.  W00tw00t for the crazyteam.  I actually scored.  Wow.  [is rather impressed]  I never score.  Ever.   ++ Lunch  Mmmmmm, I made Cristina draw my key for English, because I can't draw to save my life.  Then Alice came in and talked about "Dirtypoo," which is the codename for the guy she likes.  Good Lord.  Generally, when y'like someone, can't you call the person something more flattering than Dirtypoo?  (Though Sheila calls the guy she likes the "Hairy Guy," so I don't suppose that's any better.)   ++ Latin  Um.  Vocab test.  Damn, I think I got less than an A.  [frets]   ++ English  So not funny.  I have an 89.0% flat.  I have to not only ace the final, but probably do the Romeo and Juliet essay as well.  So much for getting to skip an assignment.  Hee, Andrea has a 89.3%.  Both of us are scared as hell for the final.  > Digital Fortress  stuff, too.  Damn, that book sucked.  I can't understand why Brian thinks  Angels and Demons  is good, seeing as he's read  Deception Point .  It's so dumb-- both books follow the  exact same pattern  of writing.  And they end almost exactly the same way.  In  Deception Point , Rachel takes off her football jersey (which is all she's wearing-- disturbing, no?) and straddles the guy.  In the other, I think Vittoria does the exact same thing.  Only with a bathrobe.  Which is why I'm not a huge fan of Dan Brown.  >>;  Tired.  Sleep.  [zonks out]

      I'm (almost) fresh out of school, so whilst everything is still hovering in my rusty steel trap of a mind, I shalt blog.  Then I will immerse myself in projects and homework for twelve hours.  Then I'll (hopefully) get some much-needed shut eye.  Emphasis on "hopefully," for yours truly has a hell of a lot of crap to finish.  Today was pretty good.  Some parts of it just plain sucked, but apart from that, 'twas all good.  :)  Yes.  I shall begin now.   ++ Hnrs Geometry, Period 0  I don't think I've done any of the homework this chapter (was too busy with my projects).  ._.;;  Therefore, I shall fail the test tomorrow.  Oh, squee.  I've always wanted to break a huge test acing spree.  ;.;   ++ ICT, Period 1  We had a test, which I am 100% sure I failed on.  For once, I'm not joking randomly.  I think I really, truly did fail.  I didn't care about the test by about the middle so I started working a tad bit sloppily.  I completely forgot to do the extra credit, and... I should have.  It might've saved me a C.  But that's okay.  I'm going to turn in all five extra credit labs for extra credit.  And I have a very strong A in this class anyway.   ++ Nonwestern Cultures IB, Period 2  Aaaah!  We're presenting tomorrow!  [dies]  Anyway, South Korea and Australia presented today.  The South Korea group couldn't present their poor ickle powerpoint.  Poor ickle them.  And Dionne wore a Korean dress thing.  Teehee.  ^-^;  The Australia group was kinda weird, but the video was absolutely hilarious.  And this is going to be half-assed because I NEED to work on my homework.   ++ Hnrs Biology IB, Period 3  Umm... IQ, video, and notes.  Jazzy needs to start taking her own notes, because my notes are MINE.  Heehee.  Yeah.  Next thing you know, she'll copy all of my IQs.  Oh, woe is me.  The video had.. sharkrape.  Sharkrape.  Like beetlerape, only with sharks.  How eloquent.   ++ PE, Period 4  Basketball!  Emily, Cristina, Shannon, Stephanie, and me against Sheila, Geena, Eunice, and Jennifer.  Nobody knows what the score was, but I'm pretty sure it's a tie of some sort.  They scored a lot in the beginning when the teams were a bit different and we scored a lot in the end.  So, uh, no idea.  All I know is that I did a heck of a lot of stealing today.  Emily scored, Cristina scored, Stephanie scored, and Shannon did stuff.   ++ Lunch  I signed Emily's yearbook, then proceeded to hog it and helped Sheila identify "Mickey Mouse" (one of her 32143 so-called hot guys).  Turns out he's neither a freshman, sophomore, or junior.  Looks like Sheila's out of luck, no?  Then she looked at Daisuke Kuwabara's picture (Because, according to her, he's got the spiffiest name in the universe.  Yu Yu Hakusho and DN Angel, man.) and decided he wasn't very good looking.  Sheila:  Nah, the guy next to him is hotter.  Though I don't know him.  Darn it!  I wonder if he's short... (she has a thing for short guys) Me:  ...  Okay.    [._.;;]  Cristina:  Oh, Sheila.  What should we do with you? Me:  ...  Okay.  Um.  Squee.  He's not short. Sheila:  Darn it!  ... Yeah.  She should ask David for Mickey Mouse's name.  >>;   ++ Latin, Period 5  SQUEE.  I swear, this period is like.. three hours long or something.  Every time I think it's just about over I look at the clock and see that only five minutes have passed.  How is it that this class goes so slow and everything else goes so fast?  Latin is like middle school, and I don't think Kline believed me when I said "inamorata" is derived from the Latin "amor."  What the hell else can it be derived from?   ++ English, Period 6  Ummm... grammar final.  Whole period.  I drew a spork in Andrea's yearbook.  In fact, I've drawn a spork in everyone's yearbook (Everyone who asked me to sign, that is).  I suppose if they're special enough they'll get a bunnybee.  That would be... nobody, off the top of my head.  Ah, off to homework.

      Whoa that was like a random title d00d.  Hahaha.  Anyhoo.   SEVEN  more days of school HECK YEAH!!!  Hmmm....what happened?   Tuesday:  So I failed my ickle pig urogenital test...well, actually, I got a stupid B.  26/30 WHAT A MOO COW.  AIYAH.  ONE question away from an A.  BOOOOOOO what a horrible test.  Yeah and then we reviewed for the practical.  English...hmmm.  What exactly DID we do?  Oh yeah we finished Romeo and Juliet FRIKKIN ABOUT TIME.  Then we watched the movie.  BOTH versions.  Well, we watched the one from like 2 million years ago and the Leo diCaprio one.  Actually, we only watched like 3 minutes of the latter, but it's all good.  Eh second we just kinda sat around and did thing.  Third we did notes and then we got our tests back YAY I didn't FAIL!  WOOHOOOO 37/39 HECK YEAH!  STUPID NEGATIVE SIGN I *roar* AT YOU.  Oh well.  Fourth period we watched lip syncs...perty damn funny too.  Fifth we drew debate team groups and things and yeah went to Stef's house and them blah blah blah went BACK to Wilson for practice from 5-7.  Wahahah the cheerleaders were there and the instructor was SOOOOO ditzy blonde bimbo girl hahaha.  Ehhh then I got home and jammed food into my mouth and shot my ass up the stairs to go and start my homework.  Lemme see...finished BSing my reading log first.  Took me like 20 minutes.  THen did math homework. Then did my history homework without reading the chapter XDDD.  What fun.  Hahahah and then it was like 930 and then I started my history notecards.  Dude it's like not cool to start at 930 when you're catching up on three month's worth of notecards.  I'm serious.  So then it was like 1243 when I finished.  Then I had to study for the stupid pig practical.  YAY MAJOR PROPS FOR POOP FOR HELPING THE JESSICA!  So yeah.  Me and Poop were online starin at pics of the fetal pig until 230 in the morning...then slept at like 3ish because I was trying to memorize the stupid manual...hahaha.  So Jessica totaled just about 2 and a half hours of sleep what fun.     Wednesday:   Biology H: Period 0  So a whooping 3 hours later, Jessica is up again and stressin all over the stupid practical.  It was actually EASY!!!  Hey we named the ducts and they weren't ON THE THING D00D WTH.  Hahahah anyway yeah.   English 1H: Period 1  We STILL had to do reading logs and book reports!!!  Angela and I tried to dissuade Mr. Dahlberg, but oh well.  Wahahah it was pretty fun though....ragged on Charles Dickens for the whole frikkin time.   Second  Sat around with QQ and literally did NOTHING while we watched all the other people make slip for extra credit....ehhh we'll do it tomorrow XDDD.   Algebra 2H: Period 3  Reviewed for tomorrow's test....hahaha and then Thalia broke her protractor and stuffs, good times.  Confusin little problems Nicholson comes up with....X/   Drama: Period 4  More lip syncs...hahah I was all up there in Laura's with ALex...hahah we were going to TANGO, but we couldn't hear the frikkin music and yeah.  Hahah I go tomorrow what fun.  CIRCLE OF LIFE, MAN!  XDDD That song rocks SHOELACES!!!!   Lunch  Ran around with Stef trying to find stupid autograph pages to frikkin buy dammit.  Hahahah yeah well then I had to organize notecards with Ruby...but it's all good.   World History H:  Hahahah worked in our debate groups.  Damn, our debate is going to kick ass!!!!  I was very excited during class...sleep deprivation does that to me.  Very sad.  Hahaha dude Angela I'm serious we are going to KICK SOME MAJOR ASS.  Hahaha.     Basketball: Period 6  Ehhh it was okay...by the time Ed got there and we were all stretched and ready we only had like 45 minutes left...hahaha YAY.  Hahaha all we did was layups and like 3 minutes of transitions...I'm MAD AT MY FREE THROWS.  STEF KNOWS.  It's very sad.  *hmphie*  I *roar* at my free throws.  Actually, I *roar* at my shot in general.  Ahh well I'll deal.  Wahahaha today was the last day for seniors...AWWW CHICKEN.  HAHAHAH it's okay YEARBOOK DUDE!!! LOL.  Anyhoo.  Must start on debate worksheet.  Plan out lip sync thing.  Finish history homework.  HAHAHA I did yesterday's without reading the book at all it was great.  Sleep deprivation is bad.

      Well.  Today was moderately better than yesterday, but I'm still waiting for a school day when suicide won't cross my mind.  I'm not suicidal, not by a long shot since I obviously don't have the guts, but I like toying with the idea.  It's scary, I know.  Deal with it.  And if you hate me, deal with the fact that I will never commit suicide.  So there.  ;.;   ++ Honors Geometry, Period 0  Rasch just taught some random thing on combinational functions and dumb stuff like that.  I think I learned this all in Algebra I.  What fun.   ++ ICT, Period 1  Allen talked for most of the period about the pretest and the test we're having tomorrow, but in the end we had lab time.  I just did biology homework (:3), studied for the insect practical, and planned my work tonight.  =)  Oh my god, I'm turning into a nerd.  (Though it's not like I ever follow my plans, lol.)   ++ Nonwestern Cultures IB, Period 2  This class was so.  Dumb.  Part of it was okay, though.  The Mexico group was just awesome, but that was to be expected.  Dwayne (Michael, actually.  But the name "Dwayne" stuck in FOP during first semester and now he's Dwayne.  Live with it.) is like this graphics genius video-editing wise (I've never seen what this kid can do with Photoshop, and their Powerpoint didn't reflect much) and their video was amazing.  Seriously.  I swear, he has professional editing programs.  Either that, or he knows how to use Adobe Premiere (And I don't!  *cry*); really well, too.  Yeah, so the Mexico group was good.  But good LORD, New Zealand sucked.  I mean, I love the country, yes I do.  But their Powerpoint was bullshit, as was their video.  And they didn't even serve FOOD (Not like I'd eat it, but still.  It'd save them some points, since they lost so much.).  First of all, their Powerpoint used abstract wallpapers stolen blatantly off of wallpaper sites.  They left the credits on, which is noble and all but doesn't say much about the group's mentality.  Next, they put their bloody presentation on a fucking  J drive .  See, Miss Farr's computer a J drive read cannot.  Same with the projector computer, so they had to use the computer in the back, and by the time Dwayne helped get everything set up there was no time to watch the video.  See, I'd asked Farr if I could test our group's Powerpoint at the beginning of class.  But by the time the retarded group finished their video (They INSISTED on showing the bloopers, which were just fucking lame.) other people had come in to test their stuff and she just completely ignored the fact that I had asked first.  An hour ago.  Um, great.  So I spent all of extended break fuming in the history room.  I must've hit Sheila with that biology book ten times.  Poor thing.   ++ Hnrs Biology, Period 3  Mm, insect practical.  I passed.  If you count B- as passing.  I had no idea what some of those bugs were, and I just realized two seconds ago that that one thing was an Ephemeroptera (mayfly).  I think I put down Neuroptera.  D'oh.  And I swear that that one mosquito was MINE.  ;.;  That huge grasshopper looked like mine, too.  Only smaller.   ++ PE, Period 4  Yay, more basketball!  This time it was, uh, Emily, Sheila, Shannon, and me against Cristina, Monica, Felicia, and Sarah.  We won, yay!  Quoth Cristina:  "Crap, now I know what it feels like to be on the other team."  And they still think I'm fast.  AM NOT.   ++ Latin, Period 5  I forgot my booooook.  So we read a story (I read the inside of my eyelids) and then filled out a worksheet.  It was dumb.  And then class ended.  I was happy.   ++ English, Period 6  We almost finished the  Romeo and Juliet  movie, which sucks.  Yesterday I forgot to bitch about what they did to my favorite character (Mercutio).  Well, yeah.  I have absolutely  nothing  against black people, but they turned Mercutio into some... freak.  A lot of other things bothered me too-- mostly that Romeo saw that Juliet was alive and Juliet watched Romeo die.  Stupid Hollywood.  Afterschool I went to Felicia's house with Emily, Rachel, Krupa, and (duh) Felicia.  We worked on editing our history project video but didn't succeed much.  >>;  Damn.  I'm tired.  ;.;

      I'm so proud of myself.  A whole Latin sentence  blatantly copied from the book  thought up from my very own little head!  :3  Ahahaha-- look, a cow.  Yeah.  So.  Today sucked.  It was okay at first, but then I woke up.  After that, everything started going downhill.  See, I got up at 5:00.  I got bored, so I went on the computer and put 'Wadachi' (Gorgeous song, btw) on my mp3 player, then charged it because I put too much stress on it yesterday.  Then I thought, "Hey!  I'm on the computer.  Why don't I just update my fanlistings, just in case?"  So I click my Firefox tab, and BOOM!  Domain explodes.  "Well, great," I think.  "Just fucking lovely."  Y'know, I've cussed more today than in the last three months put together.  And I've broken my scowl record.  I looked like I was going to steamroller anyone who talked to me for three hours straight.  (I'm not great at staying angry.)  See, here's the basic "breakdown" of my oh-so-fabulous day.  And if you couldn't discern the sarcasm in that statement, you suck.  So hard.   ++  Hnrs Geometry, Period 0  Rasch gave back our fantastical tests today (See  urlLink this post ) and I got a fucking 97.  You know what problem I missed?  The one with the QUADRANT.  Of all freaking things to miss, I forgot the stupid quadrant numbers.  So, yeah.  Stupid much?   ++ ICT, Period 1  Finished the extra credit Lab 18 thing.  I swear, Moronic ICT Lab Partner strikes again.  Allen asked how to set the universal shift register into parallel load, but he wouldn't let me answer the question and made An do it.  An had... big surprise... no idea.    Allen:  An, you're blonde, aren't you. An:  Yeah, but just sometimes. Me: ...! Allen:  Well...? An:  Ummm, like that?   [sets Clear to 0]  Me:   [slaps head]   The END, An!  Mode control is at the END! An:  Ohhh.   [sets mode control to shift left]  Me:  Holy piece of--  No, not good.  Not good at all.  So,  high:   Labs are DONE.   Low:   My ICT partner is still an idiot.   ++ Nonwestern Cultures IB, Period 2  History project presentations!  Argentina's Powerpoint presentation sucked so hard.  It was just... plain.. white.  [snuggles her presentation]  They gave out stuff that didn't look quite safe, so I gave mine to Nick.  Clesceri.  Now that I think of it, I wish I hadn't.  The Jamaica group passed out stuff to drink, but I didn't drink it.  Nobody told me that was cherry juice!  I thought it was spiked coffee with grape extract and lime seeds!  (Don't ask.)   We present on Friday.  We are so screwed.   ++ Hnrs Biology, Period 3  I wanted this class to be over so bad.  It was boring the living daylights out of me, plus there was just something nagging and I couldn't place it.  It was horrible.  You know that uncomfortable feeling you get sometimes for no reason?  No?  Damn, am I really the only one?   ++ PE, Period 4  Here we go.  The  only  decent period of the day, and it wasn't even that great.  Sheila, Emily, Cristina, Shannon (eeeeeuuughhh >>;) and I played against, erm, Stephanie, Gina, Jennifer, Eunice, and Monty.  We won (Yaaaaay!) but seeing Shannon half-grappling everyone made me feel like a cheater.  There's this thing called a  foul .  She should seriously consider not making those all the time.  Everyone else is okay, though, I guess.  Sheila's just majorly aggressive so she tends to steal an awful lot.  Emily just stands there and does a freakishly good job of receiving and shooting.  Cristina's just... too aggressive.  She  needs  to stop hogging that ball, but she made it a lot today so nobody's complaining.  =D  And I just.. steal and run around and pass stuff.  Yeah.  Sheila thinks I'm fast.  >>;  Well, maybe if she didn't weight 4324123 pounds-- I'll shut up now.  I'm being a bitch, and nobody deserves that.   ++ Lunch  Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to suddenly find out, entirely out of the blue too, that one of your friends is a complete and utter homophobe?  I mean, it's not like I'm going to start hating her or anything, but I do know for a fact that I will never look at her the same way again.  When Shannon expressed that she hated gays last week, I just didn't know how to respond.  I mentioned GSA, and all she said was "GSA is sucha joke."  But that's not what's bothering me.  It's something else she said-- about an occurence that incurred said wrath against homosexuals-- that bothered me.  Much as I try to hide it, I'm far too sensitive and curious for my own good.  Yeah.  So now I'm worried randomly over someone who shares absolutely  no  similarities with me and basically believes the opposite of what I believe in concerning everything.  Smashing.   ++ Latin, Period 5  All you need to know is that it was stupid, dumb, and thesaurus.   ++ English, Period 6  We watched the modern version of  Romeo and Juliet , featuring Leonardo diCaprio.  Honestly, I have had enough of this stupid couple.  Oh, and Etherton?  If you're reading this by some sick demented chance,  stay away from me .  I mean it.  If you come within five fucking meters of me ever again, I will  kill  you.  So yes.  After the bell rang, I went back to the car.  Daddy drove me home, and then he decides to tell me randomly that the power is out and has been out since nine o'clock in the morning.  So I'm thinking something along the lines of, "Great.  Just fucking fantastic.  A perfect crowning ending to the worst day of my life.  E-ver."  Slouched in the sofa and ate cold leftovers because the microwave was screwed, and then I went upstairs and just listened to music on my mp3 player and thought randomly about shiny sharp things for an hour and a half.  And then the power went on.  And all was good.  Until I found about some other things, which are quite disturbing and have no place in this blog.  This entry doesn't even cover half of what's bothering me.  Some things are just too personal for words.

      OMFG.  I. HURT. LIKE. A. BIZZAP.  Arggggggg.  Nuuuuuuuuuu.  The PAIN.    So hmm...got up at 9 yesterday morning...  That was...eh, pretty late, to say the least.  So practice started at 10 today...picked up jo-D since she decided she DID need a ride....again.  Hahaha.  So we got there first and saw Mr. Wong and Michael there....hahaha Mike's a CHEATER when they play knockout...and he screams like a girl   So then Trish got there and she got SUNBURNED...hahaha.  Then Nemo and Ushi came....but genius Laura....AHAHAH.  The dork was slicing cucumbers...and she was DONE...and then she sliced up her hand puttin the knife away...dork.    Hahaha so there was a huge band-aid running down her palm....and her fingers were all wrapped up...AND she had a blister.  Hahah LOSER.  Steph got there at 10:03...hahaha.  We got to wait for her...kinda.  So...practice smelled today.  Really bad.  We did layups...we missed 12.  So Trish decides she don't want us to do Crazy 8's...so instead, we did Lucky 7's.  Hm.  I dunno.  I GUESS they're better than Crazy 8's....just gotta go back and forth....sprinting, then backpedaling...hahaha.  It hurt.  BUT STILL.  Better than Crazy 8's.  Now THOSE are HELL.  Anyhoo.  So sprinting down the court was one, backpedaling was two, sprinting would be three....and so on, all the way up to seven.  And that would be ONE.  Trish wanted us to do 12.  Ohhh dear.  Hahaha she kept giving us chances to cut it in half with free throws...and...well, we're not a very good free throw team.  Yeah.  Sounds better that way.  Hahah we ended up doing 10...Nemo made the last  free throw.  I KNOW.  Of all people, NEMO made it.  Hahaha.  Then we were gonna do defense on dribbler, but Trish didn't wanna do anything...and wudda had to since we only had 5 people...YAAAAAY!!!    We did pick and roll for the LONGEST time.  Then did plays...outta bounds plays....HAHAH GREAT WALL.  Oh yeah...press break, too.  Then shot more free throws and did lines...[sigh]  Hhaha...jo-D was the only one who made hers.  I tried to convince Trish to let us play knockout instead of shootin and doing lines...but she said we could play AFTER.  The thing was, after running, we were all too TIRED to play knockout...but we played anyhoo....AND I WON!!!    Hahaha.  Because I JUMPED.  Ushi doesn't believe me when I say my free throws are A LOT better when I jump.  xD  Hmmm....went out to lunch with the grandparents...service was HORRIBLE.  Didn't even get ice water....they were "too busy"....I was like...WHAT THE HELL?!?!?  ANYYYYHOO.  Went to some Korean supermarket because my grandma wanted to...my bro and I completely loaded up on junk food...bought like 7 bucks worth...which is a LOT, considering they were all like 3 for 99 cents...xD  Cheap Asians.  Came home and did nothing....until like 4ish.  Then me, Daddy, and the grandparents played mahjongg..then Daddy had to leave to help somebody do something or another...then Ushi called and told me she would pick us up at 5:30 for Nishi's obon.  So I ended up having to steal money from the Boy Scouts...HAHA my mom's the treasurer...xD  Hahahah.  But I put the money BACk.  i'm GOOD.  Hahaha so then it took us a while to get there....and we drove around in big circles trying to find a parking spot...hahah and then we called Nemo and found her.  Talked to her for like 5 minutes, and then she decided she wanted to DITCH us and go check out guys...hahaha.  LOSER.  So me, Ushi, and jo-D went to get Teriyaki Chicken....hahaha.  Then we went to dance with the old people...  OMFG.  NICHOLSON WAS THERE.  AND SHE SAW ME.  oO;;; I WAS GONNA HIDE!!!!  And then Ushi and jo-D were being HORRIBLE to me.  Hahaha so we sat down...and Nicholson was dancing right there...they went around in circles.  Hahaha.  So she was like, "HI!!!  you should come dance!!"  And I told her we were gonna eat first....hahah.  So then she comes around again after like 20 minutes...and she goes, "You're eating too slow, Jessica."  Hahahah.  So then we  finish...and then Ushi and jo-D insisted that we find Nicholson so that we could dance together....STUPID.  Hahah.  We were trying to find Mrs. Higashi to give her our stuff....Ushi set off the car alarm...LOL.  Hahaha.  So yeah.  We finally find Mr. and Mrs. Ushi...and then they take a LONG break.  Hahaha.  So then we find Nicholson and we just follow her...SHE KNOWS EVERY. SINGLE. DANCE.  Hahahah.  And they SMELL.  I would just get a hang of the stupid song...and then it would end.  Haahah.  Ohhhh dear my legs started hurting for the LONGEST time...POOOO.  Hahaha.  So it was like 830 when we finished...and Nicholson made me promise to go to OCBC and the Higashi one so she could teach us more dances....  hHHahhahaa.  Yeah.  SO then we FINALLY went to get jo-D a snow cone...she'd been whining about it FOREVER...hahah Michael got condensed milk on his...the d0rk0...LOL.  Hahaha.  Then Mr. Higashi bought a ticket for the raffle and won $1000!!!!  D0000000000D....hahahha.  Then they kidnapped him to give him a big check...and Mike was all happy because he got BUBBLES...hahah and he was trying uber hard to get the stick thing outta the bottle...hahaha  There were bubbles at the top and he blew on it and they flew in his face...  So he gets upset that he can't get it out...then Kat pulls it out in like two seconds...and then he's all happy...haha.  On the way back...my legs DIED....and we finished our dinner...hahaha.  My CHICKEN CAN FLY!!!  ANd ushi's rice tasted like orange...hahaha.  LOSER.    More surveys.  No, I DON'T have a life.  Actually, more than anything, it just hurts too much to do anything.  Hahaha.

      One more day of Anime Expo.  Eeeeeee.  Oh, and happy Fourth of July.  But I honestly don't care about you, because I'm too happy... and... stuff.   I.  Saw.  Tomokazu.  Seki.   Whee.  And I have his autograph.  He autographed my Weiss art thing.  I need three more signatures (Koyasu, Miki, Yuuki).  And then my life will be complete.  G'bye.  ^_^

      WOoOoOOooO HOOOOOO I don't smell like WHIPPED CREAM no more!!!  Muahaha.  Dammit I have this pounding headache.  Again.  Lesse.  Could be because of the lack of sleep, because I inhaled whipped cream essence for like 5 hours, because we went running around the park with whipped cream in our hair and bottles of whipped cream in our hands....the list goes on.  Okay...crazy weekend recap.  Or, rather, just a recap of yesterday and the first half of today...  Went to bed at 12 Friday night....didn't fall asleep until 2ish...got up at 6...FOUR hours of sleep.    So Saturday, I had class until 10:30....and the headache was there too.  DAMMIT it's been a whole WEEK since I first got this headache...and I really don't think that's a good thing.  Then came home and tried to sleep the headache off....couldn't fall asleep, so I beat the living crap outta the little idiot at Mario Kart Double Dash.  Muahaa.  Hahaha and then called Ms. Catherine Choy to tell her about the sleepover in the first place....we kinda forgot ...Hmmm then went junk food shopping with Gurgle...holy SHIZNIT we spent 18 bucks on like 6 bags of stuff....that's hella expensive for JUNK FOOD...lol.  It took us FOREVER to decide what kind of food to get...we kept seeing things and picking them up and going, "oOOoOOOo...." and then putting them back down...  Hmmm we ended up bringing Doritos, the COOKIE BARS (2), Kit Kats, Crispy M&M's, and 24 canned soda thingys.  So then went home and sat around and did NOTHING until 7...and then left for Steph's house.  Ahahaha Steph wasn't even there yet...Ushi got there first and yeah.  MUAHAHAH I BEAT JO-D!!!  LOOOOOSER...and she lives literally two blocks away...the car ride from Steph's to jo-D's would be a whopping 25 seconds.    It took us three trillion years to get all the stuff outta the car...there was a LOT of junk.  Hahaha.  So me, Ushi, and Gurgle were sitting around and then Michelle came...and Steph FINALLY showed up...lol.  Hhaa she went and bought WHIPPED CREAM...which we were going to use on a few *SPECIAL* people who decided NOT TO SHOW UP.  Hahaha.  oOoOOo JODY'S MOMMY BOUGHT A 5-POUND BAG OF GUMMI BEARS....I was in HEAVEN...LOL.  So we were bored and Ushi brought some REALLY old-school board games...lol.  Haha we played Apples-To-Apples...hahah it's actually an okay game.  hahah.  That was a CRAZY game.  Haaha so halfway through Cat calls and decides she's COMING after all....so we decided to postpone tackling the next game until she got there.  We went downstairs to pig out on the massive stash of junk food we brought...then we decided to order pizza since USHI was SUPPOSED to bring the pizza in the first place...hahah it took us FOREVER to decide what we wanted...ended up ordering 2 medium supremes just so that everyone could have what they wanted.  Oh yeah...we got buffalo wings, too.  HAHAHAH we ate about HALF of one pizza.  That's IT.  AHAHAHA.  Steph still has a pizza and a half and an order of buffalo wings...  Hahah I forgot who came first...Cat or the pizza...but yeah.  Haha so Cat got there while we were playing Scrutineyes...another one of Laura's ghetto games...hahaha.  USHI AND NEMO CHEATED!!!  THEY TEAMED UP!!!  That's not fair.  Hahaha Laura was reading them off the Michelle and Nemo looked like she was gonna fall asleep...hhahaaha.  So me and Steph both ended up with 17 points...Ushi and Nemo had 18...jo-D had 9.  Hahaha but Steph and I declared ourselves winner by default.  Hahaha.  Then we played ANOTHER one of Ushi's games....called Curses.  It was SOOOOO frikkin hilarious.  Hahaha.  Steph won...Nemo lost.  LOL.  Damn we were CRYING...it was so funny.  Hahaha.  It was like delayed-reaction and EVERYTHING.  LOL.    Hahaha and then Steph decides she DID wanna watch Spiderman II, so she calls 411 to get the number for AMC and sits there yelling at the phone to hurry up and give her the showtimes....hahaha.  Steph, you rock my socks.  Hahaha.  So she gets off the phone and tells us that there's an 11:00 showing and a 12:15 showing...and mind you, it's 10:55 right now.  Hahaha.  So we start cramming junk food into every conceivable place...hahaha while Steph called her mom....and they were out EATING DINNER.  AT ELEVEN AT NIGHT.  LOL.  So we all squeeze into the ickle little car....me and Laura shared shotgun while Cat, Nemo, Gurgle, and Steph crammed into the back...hahaha Ushi was about to fall out when she opened the car door...Mrs. Chen drove right onto the entrance place thing...lol.  So we get there and we're really afraid that it would be sold out...but NOOOOOPIE!!!  The SOLD OUT sign wasn't flashing..and we were all like, "WOO HOOO!!!"  And then Steph goes up to the window to go and get the tickets and the mean lady behind the counter says that the tickets are sold out....hahha.  Steph was like, "BUT IT DOESN'T SAY SO ON THE BOARD...!!!"  Haahaha.  So we bought tickets to the Terminal instead...which me and jo-D already watched...and we were looking for the right theatre....and we get there and the LADY LIED!!!  THE WHOLE FRONT ROW WAS EMPTY...lol  Yeah...but Spiderman isn't the best movie to watch when you're THAT close.  haha we busted out all the food we hid away...there was a LOT....stupid Nemo INSISTED on getting an ICEE....lol RETARD   So yeah....won't say much bout the movie in case you's all gonna go and watch it...but I got REALLY dizzy when he started like flying through the night with all the lights on and blah blah blah.  oOOOoo DIZZY.  hahaha.  So it was like 1:20 when we got outta the theatre...and Steph called her mom to come and get us...and we started talking about getting drunk and stuff...LOL.  It was really funny.  Hahaha.  Muahaha this time I was SMART...we made jo-D and Ushi ride shotgun...and the rest of us crammed in the back.  Hahaha Cat sat up so that everyone would fit...oOoOOo LOOKIE SMART PEOPLE!!!    Haha can't remember exactly what we did....but we talked A LOT.  Hahah STeph is like THE boy expert...hahaha LOL.  Crazy bopkin she is.  Oh yeah...we tried to tell ghost stories, but it didn't exactly work out the way we wanted it to...HAHAH so then we got REALLLLLY bored and Nemo decides she wants to call Stacey on her cell...since the last time Stace gave us her cell number, she told us if we EVER called her at three in the morning, she would drive down and make us run lines in the street...HAHA.  She didn't pick up....so then we hung up and started listing things to leave on her voicemail....GOOD TIMES   Hahaha so we did the Big Butt song first....and then Steph was "Jane Harper" calling from "Jack's accounting" to refinance something or another....we wrote out a script and everything to make her read it with pure monotony...but she broke out laughing...hahaha.  And then Ushi and Nemo went crazy and started counting in Japanese into the phone..it was kinda odd.  Hahaha.  Ehhh whatever.  We figured since we were probably already screwed, we might as well have fun with it...  Hahaha so we decided to go to the park across the street from Steph's house... she lives across the street from the Countrywood park...hahah.  THE LIGHTS WERE FLASHING ON AND OFF....wherever we went, they would turn on and off...and the bathrooms were open and they scared the crap outta us...lol.  We ran back to Steph's house...hehe.  Then we did the toilet-paper thing...the one where you take a length of toilet paper, and for every piece, you gotta tell something about yourself...hahaha.  It took FOREVER to get through Cat, me, jo-D, and Nemo.  LOL Ushi took ONE.  Hahaha.  Ushi has THE weirdest cousins...Nemo had some pretty interesting things to say...*coughRoberthackcoughcough* except she kept saying the same things over and over again...and then we got Nemo all excited...and then we spent an hour talking about hot guys...lol.  NEMO WAS SOOOO EXCITED.  Hahaha.  So then Steph fell asleep during Nemo's 9-tissue rant...hahaha.  It was like 5:45...and we got Steph's make-up kit and started messing with her face...LOL.  Hahaha but see, I didn't DO anything.  I just took pictures.  Muahaha and then we opened the whipped cream...I mean, since SOME PEOPLE weren't there to enjoy the whipped cream, we decided to put it to better use...hahaha.  Nemo creamed Steph's face...and Ushi dripped chocolate syrup on it...stupid Ushi.  Her camera woke Steph up...and she was like, "Whaa.....?"  hahaha  and then she told us she just got her hair straightened so she wouldn't be able to wash her hair for two days....  AHahaha.  She came back and we had an all-out war...hahaha.  Man, I didn't even DO anything and I STILL got a TON of cream in my hair...lol.  Hahaha Ushi and Cat and Nemo were locked in the bathroom while me, jo-D, and Steph were waiting for them to come out so we could cream them...hahah.  THEY STARTED THROWING TOILET PAPER SOAKED IN WATER....ahahah.  Nemo switched sides and came onto our side....I jammed my finger when they slammed the door on it...  Hahaha.  We ended up chasing Ushi and Fishsticks back to the park....ahahha but they were ARMED this time!!!  Haha they had that body spray crap they found in the bathroom....SHIT.  hahahaha.  Psh.  Stupid Nemo left her station so Ushi and Cat just ran all the way back to Steph's house again...lol.  Hahahaha.  We were SOOOOOOO tired when we got back...hahah we were running around in flip-flops and whatever...XDD. Muahaha I think we got more exercise in those 20 minutes than we've gotten all summer.  That's pretty sad.  Hahaha so we finally call a truce and start cleaning up the house....and it's REALLLLLLLLY disgusting and sticky...and there was whipped cream ALL OVER THE PLACE....EVERYONE smelled like whipped cream -- it was disgusting.  Haahah so by the time we were actually done cleaning, Steph had fallen back asleep and it was 730-ish.  Hahaha jo-D zonked out first....I went into the bathroom to change outta the STINKING WHIPPED CREAM clothes...and NEMO STOLE MY CHAIR.  THE STUPIDHEAD.  Hahah.  She went next....and then Cat, and then Ushi.  Jessica fell asleep last.  I WASN'T TIRED AT ALL!!!  Hahah I ended up playing with Steph's Tetris thing...but it made too much noise and Laura wanted me to turn it off....lol USHI'S A LAZY PIG!!!  NOT A COW, A PIG!!!  Hahaha so I wake up about 930-ish...meaning Jessica got a whole hour and a half of sleep, bringing her total up to 5 and a half in the past three days.  The pain.  My head.  @_@
