       My resolution for 2004 is to read a novel a week.

      According to a Sports Illustrated  urlLink article , here's what  George W. Bush thinks of the Iraqi Olympic Soccer team :  "The image of the Iraqi soccer team playing in this Olympics, it's fantastic, isn't it? It wouldn't have been free if the United States had not acted." According to the same article, here's what the  Iraqi Olympic Soccer team thinks of Bush :  "How will he meet his god having slaughtered so many men and women? He has committed so many crimes." "The American army has killed so many people in Iraq. What is freedom when I go to the [national] stadium and there are shootings on the road?" "We don't wish for the presence of Americans in our country. We want them to go away." "I want to defend my home. If a stranger invades America and the people resist, does that mean they are terrorists? Everyone [in Fallujah] has been labeled a terrorist. These are all lies. Fallujah people are some of the best people in Iraq." One player said  if he were not playing soccer he would "for sure" be fighting as part of the resistance.

      In the last two weeks, my seven-year-old  urlLink son  has bought two products that have been greatly improved over the originals. The first is the  urlLink GameBoy Advance SP  he wants to marry. The second is  urlLink this :   urlLink     That's right, scientist have finally created a  self-inflating  whoopee cushion! It's like a perpetual-motion laugh machine.

       urlLink      urlLink Survivor 9  "Vanuatu - Islands of Fire" has posted contestant bios. My first-glance favorite:  Sheep Farmer  urlLink Dolly Neely , whose favorite magazines are National Rifleman,  People , and Deer & Deer Hunting. No Joke.

      I love  urlLink DIY / urlLink Food Network / urlLink HGTV  Sweepstakes. Every day I'm on at least one of those sites filling out an entry. The best part (since there's no chance of me winning) is dreaming of how I would spend the money once I sold that  urlLink $1.1 Million Dream Home  or driving around in that  urlLink restored '62 Corvette . But I haven't had one single daydream about DIY Network's "Do it with Duct Tape" Sweepstakes. Grand Prize - $5000 in Duct Tape products. And still I signed up every day and made sure the contest was over before posting this (lest you sign up and become competition to my entry).

      Although I describe myself as a "beer snob", I am not a very good beer critic. I just know what I like. The Dogfish Head  urlLink  Shelter Pale Ale   that's in my fridge now is very good. It was the first beer I got at  urlLink Oaklyn Discount Liquors , which I would not have thought to go into until my brother recommended it. They have a good selection of craft brews, but I don't know if it's worth having to wait behind a woman buying a case of Molson Ice and a pack  of rolling papers  (apparently the latter being a last second "Ohh... almost forgot" kind of purchase).  What I really liked this summer has been the Smuttynose  urlLink  Old Brown Dog Ale   and the Lancaster  urlLink  Milk Stout  , both of which have gone really well with  urlLink burgers and steaks  . Both beers were purchased at  urlLink Voorhees Discount Liquors , which has more microbrews and (from my experience)  fewer potheads .  I'm still looking for someplace around Philly that sells  urlLink Kennebunkport Brewing Company  beers. They're the beers that turned me into a beer snob ten years ago.  urlLink

      My  urlLink Yahoo Fantasy Football  draft was Thursday night. I sorted out my pick order (bumping T.O. up) and put some guys on the "Do Not Pick" list (Emmitt, all of Dallas and NYG) and let the computer do the rest. After a couple clean up trades Friday morning (dropped Maddox for Plummer, picked up a second D), I'm pretty happy with my team. Of course, there's four weeks for these guys to get hurt before the season starts.   QB M. Vick (Atl - QB) WR T. Owens (Phi - WR) WR P. Price (Atl - WR) WR I. Bruce (StL - WR) RB B. Westbrook (Phi - RB) RB W. McGahee (Buf - RB) TE B. Williams (NO - TE) K J. Kasay (Car - K) DEF Baltimore (Bal - DEF) BN Minnesota (Min - DEF) BN S. Janikowski (Oak - K) BN A. Lelie (Den - WR) BN R. McMichael (Mia - TE) BN J. Plummer (Den - QB)  I'll kept you posted.

      I kind of ended up with a blog when I wanted to comment on a post at  urlLink Shollow Center . I registered at Blogger and -boom- "The Accidental Blogist" was born. Hopefully I'll post every single one of my opinions before I suffer blogger burnout.
