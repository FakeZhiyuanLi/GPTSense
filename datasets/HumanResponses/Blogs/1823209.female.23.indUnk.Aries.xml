        I want to believe.    What is it about us silly little human beings? We want so very badly to believe in the wondrous, the magical. We want to believe that we can win the lottery, that ghosts roam the earth, that aliens probe us with some regularity, and that Kerry can defeat Bush.  And we want so much for  Andy Kaufman  to be alive.  ::wistful sigh::

        Oh, the irony: Gay rights and Brown vs. Board of Education    Yesterday, May 17, thousands of activists gathered at the state capitol complex in Phoenix to protest the idea that two human beings in love might become legally united even if they have similar chromosomes and genitalia.  The  urlLink Center for Arizona Policy , which organized the event, claims there were over 8,000 protestors - the Arizona Republic claims there were about 2,500. That's a significant discrepancy, even given the conventional media conservative estimates. Perhaps the difference lies in the number of as-yet innocent children dragged along by their righteous parents, dressed in white to metaphorically display their purity. God help any of those little boys who grow up to like other boys a little too much...   One of the most prominent signs of the day featured the words "Judicial Activism" with a circle and slash on top. According to top House of Representative aides (well, one of the House pages, at least) some of the legislators even brought these signs into the House with them.   Did it occur to these people that they were protesting judicial activism on the very day, fifty years ago, that the Supreme Court released their decision on Brown vs. Board of Education? Unless they'd been living in caves or cliff dwellings (it's a possibility with the militantly anti-gay crowd), they must have heard the all the buzz about the anniversary. It may seem a non-issue to most (hopefully) people today - black and white children attending the same school - but it caused quite a stir in 1954. Listening to NPR's letters to Eisenhower feature, it is blantantly clear that the decision was in fact a work of judicial activism. Examine this picture from Monday's protest:     As an astute member of a webboard on which I posted this picture noted, "the two people at the bottom of the picture would not have been conversing 50 yrs ago in a similar protest." Oh, the irony.  I'm sure the legislators had no idea that on that day they were simultaneously protesting and celebrating judicial activism... but that's the Arizona legislature for you.
