      Chris felt a subtle vibration, removed his cellular from his front pants pocket, and adeptly flipped it open with one hand. It was Niki calling. Curious as to what she wanted, since her table was only thirty feet away, Chris answered the call.  "Come into the men's room on the side of the bar now," Niki whispered.  "Are you ok?" Before he could finish, she hung up.  Mitka stared across the table at Chris. “Is everything alright?"  "Umm…yeah. I just need to use the men's room. Be right back." With that Chris clumsily pushed away from the table, knocking his flatware to the floor.  Quickly slipping through the maze of tables, Chris walked toward the restrooms. As he passed the bar he glanced at the left side of the restaurant and saw Vaughn seated alone at a table.  "Damn, that dude is big." Chris thought as he walked on to the men's room.  He now realized how one backhand had done so much damage to Niki's face.  The guys hands were huge!  The hall leading to the restrooms was even more dimly lit than the dining room. Not seeing Niki, Chris whispered her name as his phone vibrated again.  "Come into the men's room, silly."  "What are you doing?" He said as he pushed open the door featuring the sombrero-wearing hombre.  "Second left, last stall."  Walking around the corner to the second corridor of stalls, Chris stopped in front of the last stall. She opened the door and pulled him in.  "What are you doing in the men's room?" He was now more than a little annoyed.  "I didn’t think you would come into the ladies room." She was smiling, exhibiting her trademark dimples.  Chris' annoyance faded as she smiled at him. The bruises that had been purple-black last weekend had faded yellow by now. Makeup effectively camouflaging them; the marks were now noticeable only because he knew they were there. Thinking about the bruises, Chris' anger flared at Vaughn, but also at Niki for being here with Vaughn, and because she hadn’t called him back Wednesday night.  "He was at my house Wednesday when I got home. He was waiting outside in his car. He switched duty with his roommate. So I couldn’t call you, obviously..."  Standing this close to her, he could vaguely smell Dr. Pepper.  “So what’s up?” Chris asked, impatient now.  “I just wanted to tell you why I didn’t call you back Wednesday night. You think I am stupid, don’t you?”  “No. I don’t.” he said, although in reality he was thinking: “Yeah I do, young and stupid.”  “Are you on a date or something?”  “Yep.”  “How’s it going? She looks boring.”  “Hard to gauge, since I am here sharing a stall with you.”  “Oh.” She quickly leaned forward and kissed him sweetly, almost primly. “You better get back to your date then.”  “Why the hell did she do that?” Chris thought.  “Vaughn will begin to wonder why I’m not back. He’s leaving tonight. Enjoy your date.”  “Why the hell did you do that?”  “It was stupid.  I don’t know.  I just wanted to.”  “Oh.”

      Scenes a faire is a French term used in copyright to describe when there is essentially only one way to express a certain idea.  To grant any one person a monopoly over such a simple expression would necessarily undermine the copyright system as we know it.  Scenes a faire are thus not granted protection under American copyright law as their protection would not promote the progress of science and the useful arts.  A scene in the life is just me expressing my desire to write down my individual ideas for stories, the scenes are essential to my mental story boards and I just want to record them somewhere.  They may suck, I may not be a good writer, but if I am not, just never come back to my site.  Oh I used scenes a faire for the page URL because it was French and sounded cool.

      Friday's I work all day.  I hate fridays.  Now I am sitting at home watching a depressing movie and drinking Gewurztraminer.  Thats a German wine.  I like German wines the best.  My favorite is Riesling.  German wines are sweet, I like them much better than liquor.  Tomorrow is Valentines day.  How depressing.  Darien hasnt called, I dont care except out of principal.  I m a little tipsy.  Out of principal he should have called me.  BUt he wont, not until like MOnday.   Im home by myself watching Sliding DOors/ It is one my favorute movies.  I had the opportunity to spend Vday with Morris Scott, but I decided against it.   I decided I didnt want to start something, long distance, somethign I have tried before and didn twork.  Something scary.  Back to the movie.  Real life is bad.  Im drunk.

      Today was another routine day, went to class, came home, took a nap.....blah blah blah.  It just makes me think about how boring my life is.  I mean it has been virtually the same thing every day for the past 6 years, maybe even longer than that.  I am in a rut.    Everyone around me is doing such new and different things with their lives and I am doing the same old thing.  Go to class, work a little part time gig, have an internship, go back to school blah blah boring.  Indie is getting ready to move to Miami, how awesome is that?  Not necessarily Miami, but the ability to say the hell with it and quit your job and take off on a whim.  I want that kind of freedom, that kind of change.  How exciting.    And if people arent making life changes in work, they are off starting their family lives.  Of the four quasi serious boyfriends I have had in the past 6 years, at least three are off having kids and/or got married.  Its insane, every week this year I feel like I lose another friend to marriage.  My sister got married the tenth of January, Liz got married last year, Lei just got engaged,  J is getting married in March, Erika got married last year, Idia will be married in two years I think, and she is younger than me.  My ex called me to tell me he knocked up his current girl, why would you call me to tell me that.  What the hell am I supposed to say, Congrats?  Should I send a card?  Good Luck with your new baby mama, I dont think hallmark makes that card.  Why cant my exes just leave me alone, or why cant I leave them alone for that matter.  Anyway, this can be a post by itself so I wont get into it now.     My gosh people we just graduated college in 2002.  We are only 23 for pie's sakes.  (LOL.  My mother thinks substituting words for using the Lord's name in vain is just as bad as actually using it in vain, she wouldnt approve of "gosh" or "pie". )  We're still babies, arent we?  Or am I completely stunted.  Do I need to just grow up already?  I call Darien Peter Pan, because he doesnt want to grow up, but will I eventually become him?  With no prospects in line for marriage, should I start to worry.  I havent even met a man in the past two years that I would consider marrying.  Well, at least not seriously.  I think I could have married Sadiq in theory, but there were complications I purposely ignored, I truly loved the person he was and just wanted to enjoy him while I had the chance.  I knew it wouldnt be forever or even for long, but I just decided to enjoy it while it lasted.  And Darien is a subject I would rather steer clear of.  Im still not sure how I am going to deal with this one yet.  But I do know that it is pretty much over.  I think this is a bad fad, one that people are ultimately going to regret.  True love and marriage are just trendy right now, marriage, is the NEW BLACK.  Well I have to go to bed, have to be fresh to return to my rut tomorrow.

      I have decided to use my blog for unloading all the things that I think about.  So instead of bugging my roommates, I will unload it on the helpless public.  Below find my thoughts for the day:  I had to use the restroom today at school, ughh I hate Wednesdays.  Wednesdays I am at school until 8pm, so its either use the restroom or deal with chronic UTI's.  Anywho, so I go into the restroom, and immediately I am faced with seven choices.  Well, seven stalls to be exact, 6 regular and one handicap.  I of course choose the handicap one.  I just love handicap stalls.  They are really the best, so roomy, you can move around, take off your coat, hang up your bag and just relax.  I especially like the ones with their own sinks and paper towels, its like your own private bathroom in a stall.  Handicap bathrooms are more private too.  You dont live in fear of the six inch chasm where the door meets the stall wall.  You can really sit down, kick off your shoes, and relax in a handicap stall.    But none of these are the real reason why I love Handicap stalls.  I really love handicap stalls because of the squatters.  I HATE SQUATTERS.  Squatters are disgusting, you ruin the restroom for the rest of womankind.  In case you dont know, squatters squat, as in over the toilet, and inevitably this causes them to urinate all over the toilet seat forcing others to either squat as well, or use another stall.  It is disgusting.  But I think the ADA requires squatters to refrain from using the handicap stalls, the ADA can get anyone to do anything, theyre like the Mafia.  Im not a squatter, women were not meant to squat.  Women were meant to sit, our anatomy isnt suited to sqaut.  When we squat, we make a mess, we have nothing to aim, it just wasnt meant to be.    Im a sitter, I sit.  Well first I paper, then I sit.  The little paper toilet covers are the best, its so convenient to have them.  But if there are none, I just paper the old fashioned way, with toilet paper.  And then sit.  This leads me to my next issue with public restrooms, the auto flush.  Ok, I realize the invaluable service the auto flush serves in America.  It makes sure the toilet flushes after those who ordinarily would not flush (nasty, they are probably squatters too).  BUt it is annoying, I stand in front of the toilet put down the paper toilet cover, with the smart little cut out trailing in the water, and then WHOOSH.  The damn toilet flushes before I can sit down and takes my unused toilet cover with it.  Now I have to start all over.  Once I had to paper the toilet five times before I could get the laser just right, and stop the auto flush.  Im not hating on auto flush toilet makers, I just think it would have made better sense to connect the auto flush to something easier, like the door latch.  Then when you open the door, WAHLAH, toilet flushes and for sure you are ready for it.  Ok enough about the restroom.  Otherwise, today was a boring day.  I worked this morning until 12pm, then went to school.  I actually skipped International Business Transactions, for the third time in a row.  But omg, it is so boring and I am behind in my reading and he teaches socratically.  So rather than suffer humiliation in front of my peers I am systematically lowering my class participation grade.  Well, there is still time left this semester for me to get back in Spanogle's good graces.  But I did go to IP and Client Counseling.  I was the lawyer today in CC.  I think I did a pretty job, my client was being sued for selling a tshirt that made fun of Mr. Rogers.  Well I am off to read for Crim Pro, my fear of professor Butler being stronger than my urge to blog.  Until later...

      Nothing interesting happened today.  Work, school, home, American Idol.  Now I am half watching the Dorothy Dandridge story.  We had a meeting with two Professors from school this afternoon, for a "candid discussion on minority performance".  I was actually a little turned off initially, thinking this was going to be a lecture, but it ended up being more like a pep talk, and just an opportunity to create an open dialogue between the black students and professors.  I think I definitely needed it, I have been thinking a lot about my behavior and I think I seriously lack discipline.  Can one become more disciplined?  At 23?  Is it too late?  I need to become more disciplined, this semester is going to be the hardest.  Im not sure how I am going to do it, but I am going to have to start today. Today I begin my quest for discipline.  Wish me luck.

      I forgot to blog the most annoying part of my Valentine's Day.  Ehi called me on Saturday, presumably in an attempt to ruin my Valentine's Day, to tell me how much his baby is growing.  WHY would you call your ex and tell them something like that?  Is this simply another manifestation of male assholishness?  (This is a real word by the way.  I added it to my dictionary in MSWord.  This makes it a real word because Bill Gates owns the world, and we are all here for his amusement.)  I proceeded to tell him that I was uncomfortable having this conversation and that I would be getting off the phone, to which he replied "Are you going to hate my baby?"   But this is not the end of the assholishness I had to put up with on VDay of all days, Ehi then proceeded to ask me if  I "wanted to be an auntie?"  I sometimes wonder why these things happen to me, at this point I believe I hung up the phone.  I have really had enough, why would anyone say something so hurtful?  I guess this is another reason why I need a change.  Unhealthy relationships, I need to clean out my closet, there is no real reason for being friends with exes.  Acquaintances, ok maybe, as in a phone call every two years, but not monthly updates to rub in your face their new job/promotion, how much their baby is growing, to ask you to come to their wedding, or to tell you how wonderful their life is going in the wake of your relationship.  Not that I begrudge any of them their happiness, but I dont want my nose rubbed in it like some incontinent puppy.  I dont want to have that conversation so I dont have to rattle on about my latest dead end relationship and how, YES I am STILL in school.    I have sent an email to Isaac, sweetly saying as much.  And I think my hanging up on Ehi gave him the hint.  Two down, several to go.  I have issues, I fully realize this.

      OK I was really drunk Friday, wow.  That was a pretty pathetic post.  Never drink and blog.  The long weekend kind of passed in a blur.  Darien did call me on Saturday and we hung out.  It was ok.  I also made chili, with beef so T couldnt eat it.  Not on purpose though.  Sunday was a bore, Monday I took Anne to the grocery store and hung out with her for a while.  She has decided to move her Abbot start date to January.  I think that  is probably a good idea, although I cant help but feel like she cant take responsibility for her actions.  I dont know, I am still unsure about the December events.  I am trying to get the website up and running, so I am going to make this short.

      I have been busy this weekend, so I havent posted since Wednesday.  On Thursday I went to class and then hung out with my cousins.  We went out to this bar where I normally have a really good time, but I just wasnt feeling it this time.  It was like the crowd was all different, a lot of lame guys.  Well actually the guys there are normally lame, but they seemed to be especially lame this night.  Some guys kept hassling me, and it was annoying, I got a headache and left after one Corona.    Friday I went to work, and came in to find my boss had resigned and had been escorted from the building, just before I got there.  Not a huge surprise.  Im not going to  be there much longer, so Im not much worried.  I need to get on this job search though.    Friday night Darien and I went to see 50 First Dates.  It was a really cute movie, I liked it.  Darien didnt much want to go, but he ended up liking it.    Saturday, Morris S. came to town, so he and his friend went out with me an my friends to H2O.  I had a pretty good time, it was good to see him, I hope I have an opportunity to talk with him before he leaves.  He seemed kind of down, but we didnt have enough alone time to get into it.  He is such a good person, but he has issues like me.     Today I did some work, and then went to Leilani's to watch the final episode of Sex and the City.  It was really great, it ended so sweetly, I think it was just what we needed.  It was a happily before, but also a happily ever after.  Thats what I want, to be happy before and after.

      I have been having the weirdest dreams lately.  The night before last it was about Isaac, but he wasnt actually ever in the dream, I was just in his apartment snooping through his stuff.  I think this is due to the mean email reply he sent me.  It saddened me, I sent him an email, basically saying I didnt think we should talk anymore.  He is my ex, and he is married now, expecting a baby, and I really dont think his wife knows we are friends, as he always calls me from his office etc.  It just makes me uncomfortable, I wouldnt want it done to me, and I dont think we are really friends like that now anyway.  Its not like I really share things with him about my life.  I think he felt I was demeaning the relationship he has with his wife by insinuating our friendship was inappropriate in a romantic way.  My email had nothing to do with that, it was just the way  I  felt.  How can I comment on a relationship I know nothing about?  Anyway I am not going to email him back, I didnt want him to take the email that way, but in the end I got accomplished what I tried to accomplish.  I told him he would always have a special place in my heart, and he replied that that special place should be for my boyfriend.  I guess he forgot how big my heart is.  There is room enough, and regardless how this ended up he will always be there too.    Last night I had a dream about S.K.  Sometimes I have such a total crush on him, sometimes I dont, its funny.  I think I just like the excitement of it, the feeling of having a crush.  I dont know, there is something about him.  I thought I saw Sadiq yesterday, now it has me thinking about him.  Yuck.  I dont even want to get into, I will write more later.  But not about Sadiq.

      I havent written for a long long time.  I wish I had because now I have a missing block in my blog.  I wanted to use it to record what was going on, I think it will be good for me.  But I have been busy.  Oh well.  I just got back from spring break yesterday, I spent it in Florida.  It was nice, I got to hang out in beautiful weather, but also to just relax and read my books.  Not school books, novels.  I read Exit to Eden by Anne Rice and Dune by Frank Herbert. Exit was an ok book, it was about a sadomasochist who falls in love with another sado, I guess it is considered erotic literature, which is not usually  my type of book, but I got it confused with East of Eden by John Steinbeck, which was on Oprahs book Club list.  I ran across Exit on a bookshelf downstairs and since it sounded familiar (due to my confusion) I read it.  Anne Rice is the lady who wrote Interview with a Vampire, a movie I liked, but I never read the book.  Dune is one my favorite books, I have read it at least five times.  This is strange because I dont like science fiction and HATE things about outer space (due to my abduction years ago), and this book is about both.  But it is really amazing, it is one of the most descriptive and imaginative books I have read, and it is funny how reading it this time, after the whole Matrix thing has come out, how much the lady who wrote the Matrix copied the ideas of this book.  I think I will try to get the other two parts of this trilogy and read it, I have never read part two and three.  When Dune came out, it was compared to Tolstoy's Lord of the Rings, and we all know how much money those books and movies have made, I hope someone makes a new movie out of Dune, one was made in the early 80's, and although I loved it too, it was pretty low budget.   If I could do anyhting in the world it would be: direct music videos, write screenplays and sitcoms, or be a freelance photographer.  But instead Im in law school.  By the end of this week I need to make a decision about this summer.  I also need to get my act to together as far as school is concerned, it is six weeks until finals.  Tomorrow I will write about these past three weeks I have skipped, and try to update it as best I can remeber now :|

      I want a guy who can appreciate all types of music.  He doesnt have to be an avid No Doubt fan, a complaint rock lover, or obsessed with 80's Madonna songs.  He just has to be able to understand that there are valid forms of music beside [insert preferred coast here] rap, hip hop, reggae, and r&b.  He has to realize that even if he doesnt like or understand the music, its ok that I do.  Can I explain why Britney's new album has me shakin my ass all over my bedroom?  No, it just does, the beats, the lightness of it, music just meant purely for entertainment.  I am not sitting here and equating Britney Spears with the musical geniuses of our time (Stevie, Ray Charles, Michael, Anita, Patty, Whitney, Dolly, ...the list goes on) but I completely feel like Britney serves her purpose.  No she is not a great singer, but she isnt a bad singer, and she is a GREAT entertainer.  If I like NERD, I can also like Shania, and Sheryl Crow and JayZ, these are not contradictory interests, I am a music lover.  A lover of music, the soft crooning of Musiq caresses me into unconsciousness as I lay in my bed at night, and the funky guitar riffs of Fefe Dobson waken me in the morn.  My affair with music knows no type, the words speak to me, and either I like it or I dont, it seduces me and I succumb.  I am a puppet, music pulls my strings and makes me feel alive.  Given the hypothetical choice between giving up TV or music, I would lose television every time.    I want a guy who reads for enjoyment.  One who will call me and tell me about this great book he just read, have me read it, and then discuss it.    I want a guy who is smart, but one who also realizes other people are as well.  I want a guy who is silly, one who does voices and makes faces, one who will leave strange messages on my voicemail just for fun, one who will call me singing the latest B2K (yuck) song, because he knows it'll get stuck in my head, one who can be charmingly annoying like myself.  One who doesnt think Im strange because I make faces, do voices, strange dances, sing songs, or any other odd thing I may do.  I want a guy who I can talk with for twenty-four hours straight and neither of us be sleepy.  I want a guy who will make me pancakes and eggs in the nude.  I want a guy who is kind.  I want a guy who doesnt litter.

      I have been gone again for a while, I have just been so busy.  There havent been many developments since the last time I wrote.  I am starting to prepare for final exams in a few weeks so I have less and less free time.  We are in the midst of the Cherry Blossom Festival,  I think I will go this weekend.  Friday is Lei's birthday.  Well I sound like a huge bore, so I am going to go.

      I finally figured out my mom today.  My whole life I could never understand why she would get so stressed out and nag us about everything.  She is a control freak, perfectionist who lacks the ability to delegate.  I learned all this through Dr. Phil. {Sidebar: Did you know they made Dr. Phil into a muppet?  I think that is so perfect, but I think they should make Oprah a muppet, too.)  He had a show today about moms who run themselves ragged, to the point where it affects their health.  There was a woman on it, who like my mom, is never satisfied when someone else does something around the house.  I remember we would clean the house when my mom would be gone and try really hard to keep it neat, and then she would get home and be like "You guys cant even clean while I am gone?"  I would be flabbergasted.  How could she see mess when I saw clean?  Dr. Phil said because when things are not done the way she would have done them, she only looks at it as maybe 80% done, but she would have done it 100%, and this bugs her, to the point where she will either nag us and stress til we do it the way she would have done it or until she just goes and does it herself.  And this just causes her more stress.  She just cant accept it less than perfect, she cant delegate something and be happy that it will get done 80%, she has to micromanage so it gets done her way, no matter what the cost to her sanity.  This compounds her stress, this idea that the house must be immaculate or she is a bad mom.  I told her about the show and she agreed, she said it is so hard.  She thinks it is because when she was young, having 8 brothers and sisters, it was always a mess, and she felt her mother was a bad mother because of this.  I am not neat like that, although sometimes I cant function in a mess, that is the exception not the rule.  But I do have the delegation problem.  Why delegate when I can do it the best?  But this is not good thinking, delegation is a part of life.  Well maybe early detection is the key...Well I am off to REWASH the dishes, my roommates left SPOTS on them....

      Oooooohhh I had to add this stuff because I dont want to forget these thoughts.  I had a dream last night that one of my calssmates Lenwood kissed me in the elevator, how weird is that, I dont even know him well enough for him to be kissing me in a dream.  I miss Sadiq.  I also hate him.  Janet Jackson seemed really phony on David Letterman last week.  I dont really hate Sadiq. Darnit, sometimes I wish I could though.  Or like in Eternal Sunshine, I wish I could get him erased from my memory.  Scrub me clean like I never met him b4.  How sick is it that I am talking about him 8 months after we broke up?  I am declaring war on the diagonally striped man-blouse.  I will get therapy as soon as I am admitted into the Bar.  Nitey-nite.8)

      I just got off the phone with my cousin, who filled me in on the crazy antics of my Maryland cousins...way too much to go into here and now, it suffices to say it involved a deliberate fire, a high speed chase, and fourteen $25 dollar air fresheners.  Reecey-pooh is in town this week; for his spring break he is shadowing a woman who is a lobbyist for the Urban League.  He wants to be an education lobbyist.  Reece and I would have cute kids, too bad we have always just been friends...  Its not like I want anything to change between us, I am simply commenting that we would have attractive kids.  We are the same color of golden honey brown, and we are both tall, and Reece has a cute nose too.  We went to Gordon Biersch (sp?) for dinner with Anne, which was cool.  I think Reece and I will be friends forever, even though that sounds so fifth grade, I really do think so, we'll probably bring our families over to eachothers houses for barbecues and cute stuff like that.  My crush on SK is getting worse.  By worse I mean I am thinking about him a lot lately, uggh it is frustrating, I will probably get bored with in the first month of something with him.  That is how it always is, I meet someone - date them - its exciting for a few weeks - then it gets boring and I lose interest and it stops being exciting and I dont know how to end it - unless I just disappear off the face of the planet.  And he probably wouldnt date me anyways.:(  My relationship with Darien is virtually nonexistent.  I mean we talk but not really and we dont see eachother much.  He is in FL this week for his spring break.  It is so hard to broach the subject of ending this with him, I dont know why I am such a chicken-sh*t.  I know I owe him some type of explanantion.  This is the truth, what I will never say to Darien: "Darien I think our relationship is based solely on sex, good sex, well great sex, but only on sex nonetheless.  And I am looking for something more, I am looking for someone who I can talk to who can talk to me, and who doesnt litter.  And I want to be in  a serious relationship, I really do, like some leading to marriage forever really in love type shit.  Even if in the end it doesnt work out.  And this isnt it, nor will it ever be.  In this relationship I feel dead inside, I feel numb, my feelings for you are not growing into love, not the inlove type of love at least.  Like I wouldnt want to tell you all of this because I dont really think you are a bad guy, not at all, just one with some issues that I would rather not deal with.  And the thing that makes me really want to force myself to say these things is that I think you are looking for me to love you, that you thought that that is what would happen eventually, but now that you see how bad I treat you, you are unsure, and hey if all ellse fails you are thinking at least the sex was fucking fantastic, as in fantastic fucking!  I do not want you to get your feelings hurt, I dont want you to feel unwanted or inadequate, I want you to feel loved and respected and needed.  But I dont feel that way, and I need to let you go, because being with you scares me, it scares me a lot, because the longer I am with you, the more I wonder if I will ever feel that way, that in-love-need-you-cant-wait-to-see-you-hear-you-touch-you feeling again.  And I need that, I need that very much."

      Rosie had a Gastric Bypass Surgery, that is where the make your stomach really small so you cant eat and thus lose weight.  It is what Randy from American Idol had done, it is all the rave with people now.  I hope it doesnt turn out to be bad for you in the future.  I went to see her at the hospital, she seems to be doing ok, just a little tired and in pain.  She is on Morphine, so she wasnt really coherent.  I talked to her mom the whole time, and she told me about functioning manic depressives, and that she thinks that Uncle Pat is one, and proabably my dad too.  She said that that is why my dad is reluctant to let Annie's care be done by someone else because he thinks all manics should be able to function.  He doesnt want someone else telling her she needs to be on meds bc he doesnt have to be on meds.  My family is so completely dysfunctional.

      Oh I am in love with Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas.  He is quite possibly the sexiest man in hiphop.  I went to a concert on Sunday, it was The Clipse, Black Eyed Peas, and N.E.R.D.   The concert was amazing.  Pharrell is so cute too, although he only weighs 40lbs soaking wet (with change in his pockets).  Some girl accosted him on stage, she jumped up on stage and just wouldnt let him go.  She pulled out his earring (big diamond) and his earpiece, before a bouncer could contain her.  It was so funny, and Pharrell was a good sport about it.  He was like, only in DC.  Which is so true, DC's finest.  Chad wasnt at the show for some reason, however it was still great regardless.  The Clipse were good too, although they dont have any eye candy in their band, they have alot of energy.  But the best part of the concert was Black Eyed Peas, who performed btween Clipse and NERD. They all have this wonderful infectious energy, and they all are the BEST dancers.  Before the concert, I had my doubts about the new girl, Fergie, but she can really sing and really feels the music.  Before I didnt think she necessarily had to be upgraded to actual Pea status, she could have just remained a backup singer with the band, however, NOW i can see why they did make her a Pea.    And the best part of the Pea performance was TABOO!!  He is so cute and has muscles in his face.  His face is so chiseled and beautiful, he looks like he is Japanese and Mexican, what a beautiful combination.  He and I would have beautiful chidren, some TriniMexiJaps.  LOL.  Serious though, there is something intense in his eyes that just made me not want to stop satring at him the whole time.  I think I am in love.    I also went to a Method Man concert two weeks ago, and can only say that Meth is completely sexy too.  I cant wait til his album comes out in May.  The concert was at Dream, we were really close and Meth actually put his lips on my body (he kissed my hand).    There is nothing like a live concert with a reall entertainer.  That was the end of my fun until after finals.:(

      Something else has been bothering me lately. Maurice and Shontell like each other, as far as I can tell.  It should not be a surprise that they do bc they are both all dressup and look like gap models. I dont know how i feel about it.  I mean maurice asked me if it is cool that they talk on the phone.  And get this, he tells me she is coming to FL to see him after finals, that is in like 2 weeks.  he asked me if i thought this was too soon.  I said, kinda  but i guess if you are really feeling eachother, hey whatever, get naked.  I guess bc he tells me everything it doesnt bother me from him, but it does bother me from her.  I feel like she should at least be like, maurice and i have been talking on the phone or whatever, I may go visit him or something.  She mentioned she was going out of town alot in May and I was like oh really where, but she failed to mention fort lauderdale. i guess it bugs me bc i think she should just clear it with me, am i wrong for thinking that?   I am not jealous, Maurice is my best friend, but I dont like him in a romantic way.  I just dont want him to get hurt, or for her to try to play him or something.  And if she would just let me know what her intentions are that would make it better.  But she keeps pretending like nothing is going on, and Maurice tells me everything, he is my best friend and he is supposed to tell me everything, but she doesnt know that obviously.  I dont expect Shontell to tell me everything, just to let me know this is going on.  i am annoyed.

      I am exhausted from last night. Last night around 3am my roommate Shontell’s brother’s friend called to tell her that her brother was in the hospital.  He had fallen off a pier in Hampton, VA where he goes to school.  Apparently, he was drunk (I know this because he had called earlier and I spoke to him), wandered off to the pier, and fell in.   A stranger found him unconscious in the water.  Of course Shontell was frantic, so I had to call her parents for her.  I could go my whole life without ever having to get these kinds of phone calls.  Her dad called the ER where Jay was being treated, but couldn’t get any information, so her parents drove to Hampton last night.  It looks like he is going to be ok, they have to run a few more tests and stuff, but he is slowly starting to respond.  I obviously slept very poorly last night.  I just keep thinking how damn lucky this boy is, how this could have turned out wrong in so many ways.  He could be dead, brain damaged, robbed, or murdered, EASY.  The really scary thing is this is identical to what happened to one of our classmates in December, unfortunately Chris Bartok was not so lucky.  He wandered away from the law school end of semester party and drowned on the waterfront in Georgetown.  That could have been Jay, it really pains me to think that.  I think we all need a wakeup call; people shouldn’t be losing their children to alcohol related accidents.  We need to be better friends (who the hell let Chris and Jay wander off), we need to be better role models, we need to be more responsible for ourselves, we need to think about the consequences of our actions.   Today is my last day at work until after finals.  I am pretty bored, I don’t have much to do, but try to get some attention from my crush.  I guess that is all it is, and will ever be :(. How sad.  I think I like him, but I don’t know how to change the nature of our relationship.  I am pathetic.    It is finally over with Darien and me.  I haven’t talked to him for almost 2 weeks.  I am a coward though, I just stopped taking and returning his phone calls instead of breaking up with him.  I couldn’t bring myself to do it, I know I completely suck.  I figure he will call me in a few days and act all mad, and I will act all aloof and let him break up with me.

      Friday night we went out for Victoria's birthday to this restaurant called Banana Cafe, it is a hispanic restaurant.  Although I am usually wary of restaurants that do not specialize in a particular regions cuisine, I was pleasantly surprised to find the food was quite good.  We had a great time, however I had a few too many Margaritas.  Afterwards, we went to Ozio's downtown.  We got a table in VIP and hung out there the whole night.  We again had a blast, although I had a few too many Gager shots.;0.  There were some very interesting characters at the club.  One guy asked me if I had ever had a lesbian experience and would I dance for him, what a freak.  Another guy told me I had a once in a lifetime chance to hang out wiht him on Saturday night and I should blow off studying for finals and come out wiht him.  He felt this way because he was some bball coach, as were two of his friends, and another friend worked for ESPN.  I know this because he told me like eleven times.  I guess he is just used to dealing with the type of girls who are impressed by that stuff.  I was like, umm yea sure guy, thanks but no.  Guys are so simple and predictable sometimes.  Besides being harassed by boys, I had a blast.  This week I may or may not have done a bad thing for a friend.  (Names are changed to protect the innocent, and guilty alike.)  My friend Xxxx confided in me last week that she had a crush on some guy, which would be fine except she is engaged.  Her finace was out of town this weekend and so she made a date withthis guy she likes.  She asked me what she should do, whether she should go or not, etc.  Me, not really caring for her fiance because I feel he is to critical and just doesnt appreciate her enough, told her to go for it.  Encouraged her in fact, thinking that she would realize she needs to lose the fiance before it is too late.  I guess I feel guilty because she went through with it, in every way, and I feel bad.  I mean if she doesnt leave her fiance now she has this dirty secret she is going to have to keep forever.  And while she asked me for my advice thinking I was completely neutral, I wasnt, I really dont like the guy, I have just never told her because I was afraid how she would react.  I think she should leave him, especially now that she has told me she has been thinking of leaving him for awhile now.  That sometimes she just isnt happy.  It is a year b4 they get married, just a little early to be experiencing wedding jitters in my opinion.  But what the hell do I know, I am so dysfunctional, what do I know about a healthy relationship.  Iknow it will be hard, but I dont know that she really has the courage to leave him.  They lives are so entertwined, they own a house and stuff together, her family adores him.  I dont know what I would do in her situation.  I hope I would have the courage to end it.  I mean people get divored everyday, and they have to untangle their lives from eachother.  Its so hard bc part of me wants them to break up, but part of me wonders if maybe I am wrong in thinking he isnt good enough for her, maybe I am wrong, and urging her to give up the best thing for her.  And what kind of friend would that make me?  I dont know.  But better to recognize it isnt right, right now, then after getting married.  I have kind of sensed for a while that something was up, but she doesnt really talk about it.  I dont know.

      I have been studying for finals so here is the quick eight minute update.  Leilani and Robert broke up.  She has been having second thoughts about getting married and finally decided to end it.  I am proud of her, that is an extremely hard thing to do.  Ehi is getting married.  He apparently proposed to his (soon to be) child's mother last month and they are due to get married next year.  Does it bother me?  Yes and no, I guess not anymore than finding out he got some girl pregnant.  I wrote him off in January when he dropped the first bomb, now these are just the aftershocks...  I always wanted a sign to show me he and I were not meant to be together, I got a NEON one.  Life goes on.  Things are winding down with Darien, I think he is starting to get the hint.  I never had the balls to tell him straight up so I have just been acting shady lately.  Karma?  Shit I have Karma on reserve, all the shitty guys I have dealt with.  I think by the time finals are over, Darien and I should be over.  Ok eight minutes is up, gotta get back to the books.

      I am here at work, bored, just waiting for 5pm so I figured I would write in my blog.  I have been talking to Lei on and off all day, she is still in the midst of her crisis.  One second she never wants to talk to Heath again, the next she is calling him up because Robert pissed her off.  She has these unrealistic expectations of how Heath should act, and I am not sure how to bring her to reality.  She lives with her fiancé, yet she thinks Heath should be fawning all over her.  He isn’t going to do that.  Heath knows that she can do whatever she wants because she always has Robert as a backup plan if things fall through.  So why should he take her seriously?    I think I should tell Leilani how I feel about Robert.  I think my negativity towards him may be coming out in my advice to Leilani.  Hell, think my ass, I know it is coming out.  I think I should just tell her I don’t like the way he talks to her.  But that I don’t necessarily think she should stay or break up, I think she should do what she wants, with her eyes open.  Yeah, I think I will tell her that this weekend, maybe if she comes over to my house tonight.  This way she knows how I feel so I don’t have to try to subliminally influence her in one direction because I was too big of a coward to tell her the truth.  Ok enough with Leilani’s problems.  I have such a crush on SK.  But I can’t tell if it is real.  If it isn’t real then I definitely don’t want to do anything about it.  And if it is real then I am too scared to do anything about it.  Fear of rejection, insecurity blah, blah, blah.  What a boring story.  I need to get myself together.

      Well finals are over, I finished on Tuesday.  I am really nervous about how I did on two of them.  I guess it is my own fault, I am really afraid that I may have actually failed.  I am not sure what I would do if that is the case. Crap, I dont want to think about it.  I went back to work today, for just half day bc I had an interview with Cisco.  Part of me really wants this job, but part of me wants to be able to go to T&T for the summer. So if I dont get it, it will just be bitter sweet I guess.  I guess whatever is supposed to happpen will happen.  I think the interview went well, but I guess I just dont feel like my grades are up to par. Ok, I am not going to think about grades again until they come out for the semester.    Vaughn, my neighbor from home, visited me last weekend.  It was cool, he just stopped by on his way back home from New York. Heis a cool guy, I am not sure if I could see myself with him.  He is definitely sexy, but young too.  Najja is in town, which is so funny, I kind of forgot he would be coming to town.  He is here until Sunday and wants to get together to catch up.  I am torn about whether I want to see him, I guess I am just feeling insecure.  Alright I am going to bed.

      Apartment living is great. There is nothing like coming home late from work, starving, to smell all the good food your neighbor is cooking.    Today I worked. Late. Today is Jessica's birthday, she will be getting something from me later on this week.  I am broke.

      I haven't really sat down and written anything here for a minute. I think I have been trying to stay away from reality.  Its the beginning of summer break, I am so glad school is over, two years down, one to go.  I had a very stressful final exam period this semester, of course it was my own fault.  Not going to class, procrastinating, etc etc.  I have all my grades back except for one, the one I am most worried about.  I left that final not feeling very confident about my performance.   In fact I felt it was the WORST final I had ever taken.  So I am still semi-stressing over this grade.  Maybe I am overreacting, but I dont think so.  I had a pretty good semester grade-wise, so I guess it just proves what I can do if I put my mind to it.  Unfortunately it is so hard to put my mind to something.  Oh well.  I am really going to try hard next semester, I half way feel  like it is too late, but I am going to do it anyway.  Grades are so important to lawyers, its funny, its like this hierarchy (real and imagined) of who did well in school and who didnt.  Sometimes I find myself slipping into the mentality.  Especially this semester, maybe because it is getting so close to graduation and I didnt get the job with Cisco that I wanted.  I know I had exactly what they needed except probably the grades.  Anyways I am not going to dwell on that, I need to move on.  I am going to Trinidad in about a month, to intern and vacation, so it should be fun.  I also need to go to see what is going on with my dad.  He is starting to worry me.  Things are completely over with Darien, of course I did it the cowardly way and stopped picking up the phone when he called.  I should have found a reason to get mad at him and then it would have seemed like his fault not mine, and I wouldnt be the bad guy.  I know I should have just come right out and told him that I didnt want to see him anymore, but I am a coward.   I suck.  Now I know eventually I will run into him and it will be awkward and he will be mean to me etc. And then I will feel bad, but I guess I deserve it.  I am working, ,I am at work now, at E*TRADE still.  Next week is my last week.  Then it will be a full year here.  Wow.  I have learned a lot, but I am ready to go.  I am feeling like an employee and less like an intern here everyday. I am going to miss some things, like my crush here, Kato, but the time has come to move on.  It wouldnt have worked anyways, he is moody and I am immature.  Part of my going to Trinidad is because I just need a break from my life here, maybe in that way I am like my father.  I wonder if I am going to do this my whole life..  Take off when things arent going my way?  It is just that I am in such a rut.  Things arent going my way and I am trying to deal with that.  I want to have an adventure.  I want a break.  Ehi proposed to his girlfriend.  Seems like the thing to do lately is get married and have babies.  Vaughn, has two girls pregnant, how sad. Leilani is getting married next year, despite the problems, she is going to do it.  I went over there and hung out with her Wednesday, we watched American Idol (Go Fantasia!!) and ate Oreo tallcake from Ruby Tuesday.   Once again, Robert shows his asshole tendencies.  I am starting to hate him honestly.  He talks to her like crap, and in front of me so I can imagine how he talks to her when they are alone.  I think I want to talk to Lely about it.  But they are back together.  Shontell is on my last nerve.  I am tired of her treating me an toya, like crap until she feels like talking.  She ignores everybody when she feels like it and is rude when she feels like it and says good morning when she feels like it.  I am sick of it.  I am just not talking to her, I just need a break from her too.  I cant deal with moody people. Kato was wearing the cutest metro sexual shirt yesterday.  I know this is all over the place.. Oh well.

      Im in Florida.  I havent done much except experience family drama.  Ahh how sweet it is to be home.  I guess.  I feel everwhere I go, family is experiencing certain doom that they expect me to take on and save them from.  I cant even save myself.    Kato didnt email me back, I guess he doesnt love me anymore.  Darien has no pride, as he still insists on tyring to ?rekindle? something that never had a spark in the first place.    I suck.

      So I am leaving for T&T in like 3days.  Anne called me the other day and told me about this article in the Valdosta Daily Times, about our dad getting his medical license suspended.  It is only for six months, and it doesnt really seem to be his fault.  But it is like he refuses to address these issues.  If it was me, I would have been in court fighting this, but he was in jamaica doing god knows what.  Anne said it embarassed her, that is such a selfish and typical response from her.  It doesnt embarass me, shit happens, and I am a different person from my father so why should I let that embarass me?  I feel bad for him though, he is under an inordinate amount of stress, this is just the icing on the cake.

      June 29, 2004  I’m writing my blog in MSWord so that I can post when I am able to get on the internet. I got to T&T on Saturday with Uncle Glenn.  The flight wasn’t bad, although First Class was full.  When I got to Uncle Anthony's house, Najja and Eddie took me to the beach in Chaguramas.  It was beautiful, I didn’t have my camera, but Naj promised we would go back again before I leave. Later on we went to this club called Pier 1.  It was really nice, it is outdoors on the water, so the view is wonderful and it was really cool outside with a nice breeze. The music was good and I was surprised by how much American music they played.  We got home super late, about 6am.   On Sunday Dad and I went to Tobago, we were in the airport forever because the flights were delayed, but we finally got here and he took me around to the beaches and stuff.  On Monday and Tuesday he showed me around the island some more, it is so small, like 12 miles long and three miles wide.  We went to a lot of forts, they have a lot of them here, due to the war torn history.  I got a lot of good pictures I think.  It is really a beautiful place, although it is very rural, the roads are narrow, and there is a lot of brush.  It is a slow place, there aren’t any malls like the US, or chain stores etc, things close early, but it is a very relaxing place.  I’ve just been reading and sightseeing, relaxing.
