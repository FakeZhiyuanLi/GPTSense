      I woke up today, not to the sound of wasps but to the smell of smoke. Fire!The house is burning down! The fire has killed everyone but me! But no, builders have started clearing the garden by starting a big bonfire, although how they managed to light a fire with the amount of rain we had today I don't know. Even as I type this, the embers are nowhere near dying. Also, the roof above the bathroom has given in t the rain, flooding the lower area of the bathroom. Not good. So, with the elements attacking everything outside, I wisely decided to stay indoors, where I have food and computers. That's about all for today, because theres only a limited amount of interesting things you can do while sitting on a sofa all day. Tomorrow another post will follow.

      I have finally got my PIN for my card, which is a relief. For some reason I have decided not to reveal it to you, so you'll just have to guess. Also the scaffolding for the back of the house has finally gone up, so progress to getting a larger room is being made. It's about time, too. Houses are now being built at the bottom of my extensive garden, and building work on the house needs to resume. Sixth form and GCSE results loom, so I am becoming increasingly twitchy. Much coffee and falling over helps this. Nothing much else has happened. I've decided to have a quiet day. I appear to have upset a certain person (If you are reading this, read my post below. I apologise for starting the argument, but that in no way means you are correct.), but apart from that all is calm. I've just watched Die Hard 2, a film worthy of being called so, as John Mclaine (Is that how you spell it?) does indeed appear to be invincible. But it was good anyway, containing just the right amount of explosions and gunfire. I'd like to say that is not everything I look for in a film, ut mostly it is. Anyway, bye for now. Will post again tomorrow.

      Aha! The midden has hit the windmill now. "The stubborn twit that never listens to anyone else and just generally blames those around him", i.e. James, who seems to be happy to insult himself by giving himself an accurate reference in his own post. This sprung up in response to an argument that, yes, I started, involving two authors. The reason I started it is because James (Taking note of his self-reference) has said when he brought the book "Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves" by Lynne Truss, that Terry Pratchett, AKA "That prat with the beard" is a terrible author, whereas he is one of the greatest of living novelists. Call it obsessed if you want, but a novelist that has reached double best-seller figures in double figure languages is not going to do it by being rubbish. Now I have read an excerpt from Lynne Truss's book, and I have quickly concluded that, mildly humerous as it may be, Someone who writes "First there is shock. Within seconds, shock gives way to disbelief, disbelief to pain, and pain to anger. Finally (and this is where the analogy breaks down), anger gives way to a righteous urge to perpetrate an act of criminal damage." About a badly misspelled sign is clearly several marbles short of a box with only two marbles in it. Look, I just want you to realise that there are better books than those about the terrors of a misplaced, comma. Even if you don't like Terry's books, condemning them and insulting the author just because of some anal-retentive (hah) author who her own family would quite like to disown (she admits this herself) is, quite frankly, pathetic. I will speak no more of this.  P.S. It's spelt 'plague'.

      Just thought I'd add this blog. It's 23:17 and I just persuaded James to make his own blog, which, knowing his usual stand on revealing anything over the net, was quite easy. Good for him. I must be affecting him in some way. It's at  urlLink http://discombobulatingthoughts.blogspot.com/ . Next on my list will be Jon, who has just managed to fix his computer (kind of) and knows nothing of the blogger world. Eventually we will have enough people to make a group blog, for no good reason :). Tomorrow-wise is looking hazy, has there are only 5 people going. I have decided to ring Tim and ask him to come, although this may result in an age-old battle between him and James, who were originally friends (don't ask), but who now would happy slaughter the other one, his family, pets and nieghbours if given the chance. They survive unintentional social meetings by being icily, chillingly police to each other when talking, and ignoring each other for the rest of the time. Never mind, it will bring a smile to their faces when they realise that they are in close proximty to each other while holding guns, even if they only shoot water. Well that's it for now, I'm about to test a game called gunbound, which has been recommended to me. I'll let you know what it's like in my next post, if my rubbish compter will even let it work. Byeeeeeeeeeee.

      Amazing. I'm alive. You wouldn't have guessed. First of all, when I came home from Jenny's house about 11:30, I had to go through the Frome valley walkway, a little strip of natural pathway that runs next to the river. For some reason, instead of being lit up by near houses and warehouses, it was PITCH BLACK. I really couldn't see my hand in front of my face. I know this because I had it stretched out in front of me to stop me bumping into trees, which I did anyway, despite them being inches from face. It was lucky that I knew the path well, or otherwise I'd still be out there. Secondly, no-one minded me coming home at midnight, which is very unusual. I'm used to search and rescue teams being sent out if I'm 5 minutes late home.  Thirdly,  I was woken up at 5 o'clock by wasps flying over my head. I suprised myself by going from full sleep to out my bedroom door in under 5 seconds. So, lacking in sleep and clothes, I pressed the faulty switch in my hall, instantly shocking myself. I will tell no-one of this. Apart from anyone who's reading this, but what the hell. So my day really wasn't set up, really. James helped by providing the idea of consuming huge amounts of sugar in various forms, which made me feel better. So, tired and spasming slightly from the after-effects of sugar, I am now typing this. Tomorrow is another day, and it will involve a water fight. I have convinced myself that I am not too old for such an activity, as I have kept my two pistols and my supersoaker 3000...anyway, it should be fun, as I have extensive knowledge of the area, whereas most of the participants have never been there before. Ah well, as long as the girls wear white tops on their team, everyone on the our side will be too busy staring to do anything, so it should even out. (Just for the record,that was a  joke.  I have no wish to be blamed for it later) Anyway, time to carry on with the website building. Still not getting anywhere. Caio.

      Hey, just thought I'd adda blog for no good reason. Im supposed to be putting large amounts of mony in my brand new current account, which I'm very proud of, as if most people my age haven't already got one. But thats been moved to tomorrow, so never mind. The wasps are mounting an offensive, it seems, as one flew into my mouth and two others were in the lounge, both disposed of. Why they are still here is a mystery, as the nest they had in our roof as been professionally destroyed. Ive got used from going to full sleep to running out of my room at the sound of a wasp, to avoid them stinging me repeatedly, which they like to do. I've killed over 10 this month, one with my bare hands. Anyway, I'm still working on my website, which will take a long time. A very long time. It needs completly redesigning. I need to add a link from there to here too. Anywho, time to get on with it then. (Did I just type anywho?). I'll post either later today or tomorrow. Bye...  P.S. I weigh exactly 11 stone.

      Damn. That last post was a bit heavy. I should probably talk about something lighter now. ... ... ... Halo! Perfect. The game I brought an entire console just so I could play. Something I should write about. Well, where can I start? You've probably heard of Halo, and if you haven't, buy it now. If you can't do that, I feel sorry for you. Anyway. The game is in so many ways the epitome of what a game should be. It's genre is shoot-em-up, mixed with occasional stealth and a fair bit of driving. This includes the beatiful Warthog, THE best vehicle ever created. Think dune buggy Make it the size of a...well, a large car. Cover it with glossy, futuristic armour. Make it open-topped, with roll bars. Finally, stick a huge fat minigun on the end and it's finished. This vehicle can be driven over any terrain, run over any enemy, Survive any falls, and has the most amazing jumps and flips I've ever seen anything do when hit by another Warthog. Endess fun can be had by repeatedly ramming into each other on multiplayer and watching the effects. Its not just about the vehicles though. The AI, while not the best ever created, is damn close. Enemies jump out of the way of grenades, form defenive groups, scatter when things go wrong, and have numerous responses to different situations. Once youv'e heard a grunt cry "Get it off me, someone please get it off me!" whilst running straight towards his comrades with a plasma grenade stuck to his head, you'll want to hear it again and again. The AI is not limited to enemies however. Marines assist you several times through the game (people on your side is something that every game should have), and you get used to their personalities, so realistic do they seem. The funny australian bloke, for example, will react differently to any given situation than, say, the grumpy squad sergeant. Finally the environments are the cherry on the top. There is so much variety, from the beautiful view over the waterfall onto the grassy plains, to the snowy, narrow valleys. This really is a game to treasure, and will be copyed countless times,whih is the highest praise a game can get.

      I thought I'd start with a post of how I think about God. I leave you to interpret this how you want. Most people, even if it's only for a short moment in their lives, ponder about the existance of God in some way, but never take it further, because that means they can carry on living in the comforting bubble of not worrying about that kind of thing. But it must be that in the beginning, it was evolution that started it all. Thousands of bones, the timescale in which they existed clearly identifyable through carbon dating, can be linked to the chain that leads from the primordial ooze to upright human beings,   Homo sapiens.  There are some damn funny fossils and preserved skeletons that have been discovered, which suggests either a restricted section of Eden or that Eve had some very strange ideas. Secondly, Adam had two sons, one of which murdered the other. While this is possible, it lead to the surviving son marrying. Did I miss something there? Either he was marrying his sister, of Adam and Eve wern't the first people on Earth...  With that out of the way, we can look at a far more likely story. While I do not implicitly believe in this, it makes far more sense, and takes into account the facts not known to those 2,000 years ago. At some unknown point, possibly at the time of Ardipithecus ramidus, the first Hominid (the evolution branch that split humans away from apes), our ancestors actually started  thinking  about things, like how the moon changed shape. In fact, the sky is where the first idea of an all-powerful being came into shape. Much, much later down the evolutionary line, we started thinking that someone  up there  was in control. Things like the moon, the sun and the stars were clearly ordered. They were things you could set your stone circle by. whereas down here was chaotic and unpredictable. So maybe an appeal could be made? Maybe some of the order  up there  could be filtered down to here, if He who was in control was pleased enough? Then, add years and years of tribal mythology, wise men, holy men, priests, factions of religions being created and destroyed and running together again and finally, you arrive at the creation of Chistianity. Yes, I skipped a few important chapters there. But you still get the general idea. If you don't, you shouldn't be reading this.  Anyway, there are other theological arguments against God, certainly a benevolent one, which just shows some people are never happy. If He's so kind, then, why does he allow earthquakes and such to happen to really poor parts of the world? To which the supporters reply, God tests us. Hah, says the athiest, what about babies who die at birth, who havent got the  ability  to be tested?   God moves in mysterious ways, the supporters reply, sweating a bit now. Oh, I  see , says the athiest. So God somehow turns the truama and suffering of stillborn babies into a kind and benevolent act, does he? Just have faith, comes the reply, always a good quote in an emergency. Well I'm sorry, says the athiest, it doesnt quite cut the mustard for me. Oh yeah, so you would rather believe in a load of excuses made by scientists who can't really explain all the answers yet, then? And so the debate goes on. I've really read too many of the wrong books to believe in the existance of God now, but it leaves me with the worrying feeling that I'm totally insignificant, that when I die I will leave nothing but decomposing matter, that there is nothing beyond the stars other than the endless void of space. Maybe it is better to believe in God.
