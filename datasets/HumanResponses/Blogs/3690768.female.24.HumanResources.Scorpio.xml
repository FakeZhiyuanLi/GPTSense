      The little better part means I started drinking.   Yesterday my husbands shocks blew on his car. Which ment that he had to take my car to work this morning. This totally fucked up my plans.I had a graduation to be at. I was suppose to bake a bunch of cupcakes, pick up my grandmother (along with the food she made), go pick up my mom and get them all to the graduation. Couldnt do all that without a vehicle.  So I wait around my mom's until 1 am last night waiting for my bro to show up (he was using my moms car) and I needed to have her car at my house so I could do all this running. He doesnt show. I go to a 24hr diner he hangs out at - he's not there either. My mom calls me this morning and he never came home last night. Isn't that nice!! When he finally drags his lazy ass home - my mom's windsheild is broken! He says he doesnt know what happened!! Isn't that lovely! ASSHOLE!  I get my one cousin to pick up my grandmother and my mom gets one of her friends to drive her to the party. I have to wait until my husband gets home. This works out ok for us since I was trying in vain to get our daughter to take a nap before the party.  Nap whats a nap? asks our daughter.   I start drinking as soon as we get there. I needed it. I havent had a drink in who-knows-how-long! DH (my husband) needed to spend time with our daughter anyway since he hadnt seen her in a couple days. I had this overwhelming feeling that something bad was going to happen at the party, so I thought if I was drunk it really wouldnt affect me. One of the things that made me think the shit was gonna hit the fan was : my cousins are getting a divorce, nobody really knows, and they arrived as a "couple" but without their baby. I thought this was very odd and that it was going to draw attention. Oddly enough they had the one grandmother bring the baby up to the party after they said the other grandmother wasnt even gonna see him...blahblahblahblah.  Anyway....so I have a few drinks in me and things seem to be going smoothly. Then out of nowhere my cousin is holding his son and yelling for his MIL to come get him(the baby) because he was gonna kick his moms new boyfriends ass..etc.   What pissed me off was that the baby was in the middle of all this. He did not need to be around everyone with the yelling, finger pointing, cigarette smoking, etc. So I pried him loose from his one grandmother and I took him for alittle walk. Luckily my daughter went for a car ride with my husband to the store when this all went down.  I hate people!

      I am on the verge of really hating my little brother. He is turning 22 this week. He still lives at home with my mother  (he has moved out numerous times) . He is currently living rent free and eating my mom's food. He is also driving my mom's car around, because his van does not have insurance and he figures since my mom is blind, the car is going to waste.  My mom thought him moving back in with her was going to lessen the load on me. Boy was she fucking wrong! I seem to be over there even more now because he fucks things up or isnt doing anything at all! You would think that since he is living there rent free and my mom is disabled - that he would be doing things around the house.  BULLSHIT!  The lazy little fuck hasnt done anything! My mom has been begging him for three weeks to cut the lawn - lawn hasnt been cut! I have to go over there on Wednesday night to take out her garbage, then go back Thursday mornings to bring the cans back in! HE FUCKING LIVES THERE!  She asked him for three days to wash some clothes, since she couldnt walk down the basement steps. He finally said he'd put a load in. I go over there to switch the loads for her and I find that the little fucker only washed his clothes! Then yesterday my uncle calls him asking my dumbass brother to drive him to the hospital. My brother says yes, but then falls asleep!! It was 1 pm!! My uncle never made it to the hospital until today! My brother was tired because he stays out until 5 am every fucking night!!  He is lazy...he is immature...he is an asshole...he is selfish....I am really begining to hate him. Oh yeah - he owes me money!

      I am at a major crossroad in my life. I want to have more children or at least one more. I do not have a very good track record with achieving pregnancy and when I do actually get pregnant - my chances of carrying a pregnancy to term are slim to none. The only reason my daughter is here is because of all the drugs and bedrest I was on.   I am at a point where I need to decide weather or not to try to get pregnant. So I am going to put together a PRO's & CON's list of having another baby.    PRO   -We really want to have at least one more baby. -We don't want our daughter to grow up "alone". -????   Damn - that's a pretty short list!    CON   -How am I going to take care of our daughter if I have to go on bedrest? (no family can help) -What if my mom has another "attack" and something worse happens (ex. unable to walk or she goes blind again)- who will take care of her? -How can I handle the stress of a toddler, a newborn, and helping out with grandparents and mother? -If we have another baby, money will become tight again.    I just dont know - this is just a rough draft of my PRO's & CON's list...I am just really confused right now. I feel like I need to make up my mind soon. I know that if we do not conceive this summer that I will be having surgery in the fall to check on my endometriosis. My doc says I am not ovulating - so conceiving naturally may be totally out of the picture! And if we need to be aided by meds - then we will probably not have anymore children. We just don't have that kind of money laying around.   So we then look to adoption. I am all for it. It does not matter to me weather or not "our children" are our's biologically or not. I am even considering fostering. But I think my dh is having a hard time coming to terms of not having anymore biological children. He says he agrees with whatever I want, but then he throws in that it would be nice if he had a son to pass the family name on to. Then he filp-flops and says he doesnt want to add the extra stairn or stress on me with attempting to carry another pregnancy.  SIGH. He is making me as confused as he is.

      So the weather is changing - AGAIN! And oddly enough a cold front is coming thru with rain. This means that my head is splitting! From the top of my head to my jaw line, it feels like my head is going to burst! If it doesn't I may have to take a hammer to my head to stop the pain. My sinuses actually feel like they are going to pop out of my face and take most of my teeth with them. And I feel a migraine starting because of it.  On top of that pain - the bloating from my endo is getting out of hand. I am unable to fit into any of my jeans. So men's pj bottoms are my pants of choice currently. I know I look trashy, but comfort is key right now.  Because of the pain I have been in today and how crappy I feel, all I got done today was depositing money in the bank and one load of hubby's work clothes (and I didnt fold it).   I have so much stuff to do - cleaning, packing, sorting, etc. And I just feel up to doing any of it. I feel lucky if I can get my daughter in and out of the bath! I haven't been taking my muti-vitamin, so I can bet that's one of the reasons I have been feeling so run-down. Depression doesn't make things easier either.

      For the last three years I have celebrated Father's Day for my husband. For the seven years before that - I never really did anything. My dad was killed by a drunk driver and I never had a step-dad. My mom became our mother  AND  our father, so I have always given her a little gift of appreciation. But we never had a big dinner or made a big deal about it.  But three years ago I was pregnant with our son, so my husband woke up to breakfast in bed and a nicely wrapped gift (it was some t-shirts he had been wanting). I was so excited to be celebrating father's day, I was so excited to be having a baby. Of course a couple days later my world came crashing down when I began bleeding and went into labor and found out our son had died. The year after that I was pregnant with our daughter and we were scared to celebrate. Last year our daughter was 8 months old - so we felt it was safe to celebrate.   However, this year I really didn't feel like celebrating much. For some strange reason my grief over my son's death and my dad's death have hit me hard this year. I did get my husband some nice gifts and he said he really likes them. But I  did not  want to leave the house to go visit his step-dad and the rest of his hellish family! They drive me insane!  My SIL is the biggest psycho you will ever meet. I will continue to bitch about her throughout most of this blog - she is a pain in my big fat ass. Her newest thing that pisses me off is: she wants to throw her mother a huge 50th b.day party in two weeks. She has not bought one thing for the party yet and she's having it at some park. She is expecting people to throw money her way so she can take all the credit in the end. And the comment today that pissed me off was  "since you don't work maybe you can do some of my running around for me."  Yes - it is true - I do not have a job that I have to go to everyday and punch in/out at. Instead I am on-call 24/7 for numerous people: my daughter, my mother, and my grandparents. I clean, I cook, I do laundry, etc.   My SIL is 7 years older then I am. She is not married and does not have any kids (her choice). She lives alone. She works and then spends her money partying. I think she thinks I just lay around all day doing nothing. This woman gives me a headache just thinking about her!  Enough about that psycho.   I have been feeling very run-down lately, both physically and emotionally. My son died three years ago this week and it's hit me like a ton of bricks. My dad has been gone for 11 years this fall. I am trying so hard to get out of this "funk" I have been in. But it seems like each day it's harder and harder to get out of my pj's and into real clothes.

      Yeah so...ummmm....where do I begin? How about why I am writing this blog? Yeah that sounds good enough.  I have come to a point in my life where I am unable to afford a therapist  (when I did get to see one - it only lasted a month)  and with all the stress that has been going on in my life - it's really adding up! So since I no longer smoke pot or get drunk on a regular basis - I thought I should come here and drop off my rants, vents, musing, and the other bullshit that noone around here wants to hear anymore. This is my first attempt at writing one of these blogs - so deal with it if it's not all perfect and shit!  So here's a little bit about me: I am 24 and in my short life I have had to deal with:    1)  the death of my dad, whom was killed by a drunk driver when I was 14   2)  the death of my first born son, Connor, who died in-utero at 16 weeks gestation   3)  the loss of my second baby at 6 weeks  4)  my aunts suicide  5)  my mothers dx with MS and the hellish ride that has taken us down  6)  my psycho in-laws.     Those are just the main things that have really fucked me up in the head, of course there are many, many other things I bitch about on a regular basis!  I do also have some great things that have happened in my life:   1)  I was the first to graduate high school on my dad's side of the family  (hee hee dont I sound like I come from trash?!)    2)  I am married to a man that isn't all that bad- most of the time   3)  I gave birth to the most beautiful little girl in the world (she really is!)  4)  I became a doula   5)  I am apart of an online support group that helps other women deal with the grief & loss of their babies  6)   .....ummmm can't really think of any more!  So that's some shit about me. My life is a wild ride with new and different twists and turns every day...so buckle up and hang on -it's usually a  VERY  bumpy ride!

      I have come across many women lately who are driving me quite insane. I am trying my best to blame my angry thoughts on PMS, but I don't think I am getting away with it.   Lets start with the woman who has two teenage sons and is currently TTC (trying to conceive). Personally I think she is TTC for all the wrong reasons (but who am i?). When she talks it's all about - wanting to be "pregnant" again, the need to feel "pregnant" again, etc. I never hear her say anything about having another child, or that she is so full of love that she feels the need to share it with another child. To me thats what being a mother is. To me it's all about the attention of being pregnant that she wants.  Another woman is all about babies, she rarely talks about her older children. It's almost like they don't exist because she has a new baby. This baby is her whole life. If you ask how her other children are doing, she responds  "oh they are fine, Guess what the baby did?"   I understand the newness of a baby, but what is she showing her other children? What;s going to happen once the newness of this current baby wears off?  Then there is this other woman, whom I adore. She has been thru infertility hell and she still has her humor. Recently her and her dh have decided to adopt from an Eastern country. She has become obsessed with what other people will think about their "different" looking baby. Who the hell cares?!?!? Are these people paying your bills? Are they the ones who have to live your life? NO?!? Then fuck them!   Another thing that has been ticking me off is when people refer to their children or future children as "theirs" in the sense of property. Since when is a child someone's property? A child is his/her own person, nobody owns them! We ,as parents, are lucky enough to be there when we are needed, to watch them grow up, to help them along their way, to love them unconditionally!! I think people tend to forget this! They use their children as pawns or accessories and it drives me insane!  I  do  view my daughter as a gift. But she is not my property. I am so blessed to be apart of her life! I will do everything in my power to make sure she knows how much she is loved and adored. DH and I would like to have more children, because we feel we have the love and the strength to raise more children - no matter if they are our biological children or not!   Most of the women who have been getting on my wee little nerves, have had some sort of prenatal loss or losses. After we lost our son and then the second pregnancy - I wiewed every baby and every child as a wonderous gift! No matter their age or health status! I understood how fraigle life was and what a huge gift life in-itself was!   Well I am getting off my soapbox now and going in search of something made with chocolate......

      A close family friend finally broke down and admitted to my mother that her daughter is pregnant. This girl, whom we shall call B, just graduated from high school, the dad to the arriving baby is in rehab, and B's mom, M, just lost her job. We told M everything would work out, but she then dropped the bombshell - B is six months along!  B has been hiding it from everyone except her mom, her boyfriend, and his family. We were the first ones to know. M didn't want B to continue with the pregnancy since the baby is mixed - black and white. B thinks she can have it all - work, go to school, and have a baby without any help.   B has been very sick and has to have u/s's done everyweek because there is a "problem" with the baby. I will not mention what the problem is, but  it can be life  threatening for the baby. The baby in question will more-then-likely have to have numerous surgeries to live a somewhat "normal" life.  Having known this family for a long time - I cannot see how they will be able to handle this. I know sometimes people can suprise you in the best ways, but I can't see that happening here especially since M doesn't want this baby in her family anyway. She thinks her daughter is throwing away a very bright future. I am getting the drift that B wants this baby to "fit-in" with her other friends whom also have babies.   For as far as B is - they didn't have anything ready for a baby to came home to - they are without much money at this point. I helped them this week without B's knowledge.   Now this is the part where my mind starts working overtime (like it hadnt already!). M tells me and my mother at different times that she wishes B would just give her baby to me! And that she plans on having a "long talk" with B later tonight. Ok....my damn biological clock has been ticking in overdrive lately, so this hit me hard. DH and I have been talking about more children and our options. He wants to keep trying "the-old-fashion-way". But I cannot except this because I do not think I will be able to live thru another loss. And if  (thats a BIG if)  I was to be able to carry another pregnancy to term....I would be on bedrest and in and out of the hospital. And there's no chance that I would survive everything that happened after our daughter was born - I almost died once, it can happen again.  I am not ready to take that chance. My mom does not like this idea of us adopting B's baby, but she will support us if thats what everyone agrees on. She thinks that later on down the road M and B would regret their decision and want to be around this new baby as much as possible. And since they are friends of the family - they would already see this baby often enough. DH and I do not think a fully open adoption is right for us. We like the idea of semi-open, such as sharing pictures and letters and once in awhile a visit during a large gathering. I honestly do not want to deal with a birthmother trying to "step-in" and parent because she finally grows up or feels the need to parent.  Anyway - my mind has been running non-stop since M said that to me. I keep hearing her words echoing thru my brain -  "B should just give the baby to you. You are a good mother and you cant have anymore children of your own."  I highly doubt B will take this sitting down. She's young and thinks she knows it all (didnt we all think that at one time or another?!?).   This is her baby, she will do whatever she wants to do. I just hope whatever that choice is - it is the best for the baby.  (can someone please find the OFF button on my damn brain!!???)
