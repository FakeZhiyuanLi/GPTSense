      Thank god! After about 10 days of begging for an invite to set up a Gmail account! I've finally got one. Its still in its beta however GMail is amazing! It looks nice...no ads..tons of space! And i think i might use it now for my Msn Messenger email address as well as my email! I dont normally do email stuff but this Gmail looks too good to miss out on. In case you're confused, let me explain. Firstly. Google have set up there own Email thing. Its gonna be as good as Google itself. The email calld: Gmail has not been released to the public yet. However a share of lucky people have been used to test it out and have got their own accounts on Gmail. They also could send invitations to other people to test out Gmail! One of which a kinda person sent to me for me to set up a Gmail account. Tons of people are all rushing to get an invite so they can secure a good name @gmail.com...instead of like: this_is_my_email@gmail.com or something like that. Anyway, i managed to get: Sumster@gmail.com. ...If you want to find out more about this "Gmail" please go to:  urlLink GMAIL  and if you become as desperate as I was to get one please go to  urlLink Gmail Swap  Where you can post your pleas for what you would swap for a GMAIL invite... Thanks, Sumo

Anyway....played PS2 and playd around with my bb gun...and also watched some football.. Got bored for a while...then occupied myself for a bit...then got bored again..so i decided to shoot my self with my gas powered bbgun...(not in the leg or anything..BUT in the arm!!) Yea......that stung for a while "I'm an idiot" Apart from that didnt do much else... o wait..did some prank calling though.. annoyed the hell out of this french waiter.. swore at him in french....and stuff i got bored of that after 10 mins on the phone with the same waiter...(may have been my accent..who knows)... ehhh now im doing this.........yea  thats it..

      Where should I start? Ok...It was all going soo damn well. Great cross from Beckham and wonderful finish by Lampard. Nice football there... Ok.  Second Half: France start puting pressure on us...ok...we can just about cope... 90th minute and stoppage time...Everything going fine.. Until Heskey goes and lets some anger out on a frenchie..I dont blame him myself..but it lands the french with a free kick.   F****** amazing shot..David James... GOAL!!....ok shit!  Then 2 minutes later... gerrard messes up some well needed defence.. urlLink   and lands his keeper with a 1 on 1 with...guess who.....Henry...David James with hardly any choice runs out and trips up Henry. PENALTY! Zidane steps up again and shoots...and scores!  2-1 to france...and after about 2 seconds there goes the fina whistle... AH! Soo damn annoying! I cant be arsed to think about it any more.. O well....f*** it... Screw the english and the french....  Yea...
