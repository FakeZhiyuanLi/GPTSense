          I started my day at 8:30 in the morning...mowing..pulling weeds..and cleaning up the front yard. Then I got to babysit a two year old for hours. My family is moving to Chicago on Friday while I stay behind and start living without their support. This may be the scariest thing I've ever done in my life. The only comforts I have are my friends...the love of my life...and my brother. The real world where your parents can no longer shield you is a harsh one.........I'm going to be eaten alive.   Until the rain comes....

      Well....I'm spending my free time trying to find a job so that I can move up to Portland...this is not as easy as I first thought it would be. I just happen to be lucky. I have a ton of friends that wanna help me get ahead and accomplish my goals. I hope within 6 months to be able to move up to Portland...Basically...I have to save money so that I can pay rent while I look for a new job up there...this is gonna suck..Eventually I wanna move out on my own with Nick so we can have our own place..without everyone else...........................Ok..I'm done.........haha.....My little brother threw up everywhere lastnight..and I haven't slept much.......plus it's almost 100 out..........

       Introduction  By&nbsp;Keighla  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The nights are stygian and my side still lonesome. Alone I wait in the dark. I've done all I could do to win you over. All this runs through my mind as I watch the steam role from the axe held tight with in my grip, still warm with blood. How many times have I tried to catch your attention? How many times did I try? I have slept for no more then a few hours since I first saw you. Just the thought of being able to hold you keeps me awake. I lay unblinking, petting the hair I plucked from your brush. I remember the sweet scent of your body as you walked past your closet. All my attempts to catch your eye have failed. So many lost trying to win your love. After all I've done for you! I've disemboweled and dismembered. Do you know what it feels like to be covered in rancid, congealing, fluidic remains? Why couldn't you just like me for me? All of the slaughter, all just to catch your eye. Just once I wanted you to notice me. I use to hear that murderers got all the attention. That's all you see on the news, and that was my plan. Mrs. Gray put up a fight and cost me my left ear lobe, but I had to vacate her house. She didn't want to give it up, but her window overlooked your bedroom. Then there was the barber. He was such a quiet man. With his own straight razor, his death was inevitable. When I killed him I figured that would do it. I retrieved his heart and left it on your doorstep. Did you find it? If I got rid of him, I just knew you would be open to a new love. Did you take the time to notice? NO! People you talked to everyday, gone, and you didn't even shed a tear for them let alone acknowledge me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I finally decided to go a little more gruesome. Your mother, ah yes, she was a fighter. She had the nerve to latch right on to my arm with her teeth. I quickly grabbed her by the throat and thrust her into a metal cage. It was covered in wires that were attached to an electrical socket. I had the cage rigged up to a pulley system over an infant pool. Every time your mother uttered a word about you being better then me, I lowered her an inch. After I told her what I wanted to do to you, her mouth flew open and I just dropped her. The smell of boiling flesh filled the air. I remember that sweet putrid smell. All that and you didn't even take the time to notice your mother was missing. The one that gave you life was gone. You could have cared less. I ask myself, â€? Whyâ€?. All these deaths and no one even suspected me. It's not like I was trying to hide it.&nbsp; I did it all out in the open. No one's asked me a single question. This is why I'm standing over your mangled, lifeless body with my steaming axe. Since you didn't take the time to notice me, I figured I would introduce myself right here in the middle of street where everyone can see. Hi, I'm Johnny.  &nbsp;  just a story......hehe...isn't it kewl?

						     So.. I'm new to this side of the block.. I saw my friend, Jeff's, journal, and I figured that this might give me something to do on the net, cause there is absolutaly nothing to do.   I've been in this summer class (where I became friends with the friend mentioned above) and this is the last week. In this class I get to go to creeks and test them and their riparian(sp?) zone. I get an extra credit (which I need) will bring up my gpa (which currently suffers) and gives me something to do, so it's good. So it's all fun, but it's so hott outside.   so yeah.. not much to talk about.. Jeff wouldn't walk to safeway with me, for our lunch break, cause he was to lazy to walk with me.. he didn't say that to me though.. he put it in his journal.. hrmm.. He's fun, he doesn't talk much though, he's shy, so we never had a real good long conforsation. well.. lemi refraze that, they're good and fun, just not very long. hehe. we had a short on on the net, but there was more talking involved then normal.. so.. I hope he loosens up a little big more around me soon. cause that would be fun stuffs

						     I'm in a share the story to everyone-who-wont-see-this-mood    written april 26th 2004   An event last year happened october 21st 2004 where I witnessed a friend get hit by a car, he died on october 23rd around midnight that morning. When I ran up to him, he looked like he was already gone, he was already dead, but his body was somewhat alive because he didn't know he was dead.. or.. that's how I translated the idea in this story.     Stepping off school campus  already half way home  A car passes by  He is no longer known   He flies in the air  And lands in bed  Waking up,  he rubs his head   he walks down the stairs  and hears a cry  He runs to his mom  Screaming "Why?"   She yells his name and  He cryâ€™s hers.  She looks down in pain  He was not heard.   He runs to school  something is wrong  Everyone is crying  Whatâ€™s going on?   He sees a girl  sheâ€™s crying within  He tries so hard  to hold her close to him   She can not see him  sitting so closely, there  Has she gone blind?  Or does she no longer care?   Has everyone become mad  At him today?  A tear escapes him  As he pulls away   She gasps with a pain  and a hint of surprise  She looks around  then straight into his eyes   "Please hold on  I felt you let you  Please hold on  Because I need to know   Where have you gone to?  Are you coming back?  When will I next see you  In your next drama act?"   "Iâ€™m the Grandpa,  remember?  Iâ€™ll be in the play  this december"   She did not respond  She did not hear  She didnâ€™t even lend him  Her always open ear   It took several hours  and the entire day  For him to realize their pain  he died yesterday

						     A story I wrote a while ago.. like.. March 2nd I think.. I duno why I'm putting it in here     Iâ€™m walking home from school and up to my room. Tears are raining from my eyes. I lay in bed for hours till I fall asleep. When I open my eyes, I continue to cry. It is 2 oâ€™clock at night. I dwell in my pain for another hour. Itâ€™s 3 oâ€™clock; Iâ€™m walking down the stairs in a trance. The moonlight casts a shadow of my naked body onto the kitchen floor as I gently cross overit to a drawer. The drawer is now open and my destiney now lays in my hand. Iâ€™m drawing red lines all over my arms and chest with it. The pain was wonderful, making me lust for more. The blade quickly, and without struggle or hesitation, slips into my chest and pain screams from every cell in my body. I watch in amazement as my essence escapes me. It fills my navel and travels past my thighs to saturate the rug beneath me. I rip the thorn from my throbbing pain, and gaze at my life running off of it. I feel a numbness throughout myself, a numbness unlike any I had ever felt before. As if time had skipped a frame, I was on the floor bathing in my fluid. My vision was blurred with red; my mind is empty, unsure of what Iâ€™m thinking about. Then I realize that I am no longer there.  No one notices the lifeless figure on the kitchen floor. No one notices the empty chair next to them in school. No one notices that the stranger who walks with them home, is not there today.  I open my eyes and turn off my alarm. I go to school like every day before. The day goes by slowly, but in the end seeming as it never happened at all.  Iâ€™m walking home from school and up to my room. Tears are raining from my eyes. I lay in bed for hours till I fall asleep. When I open my eyes, I continue to cry. It is 2 oâ€™clock at night; I then realize that if I die, no one will ever notice or care, last nights dream showed it to me. I dwell in my pain for another hour. Itâ€™s 3 oâ€™clock; Iâ€™m walking down the stairs in a trance. The moonlight casts a shadow of my naked body onto the kitchen floor as I gently cross over.

						     So, I found out how to do the whole picture thing, and I'm happy.. YEY, I think it's really awesome, I love photography.... if only I had battaries...       &nbsp;   so the whole presentation thing for my class is tonight.. and.. that sux.. because I was extreamly nervouse when I practiced in frount of my classmates, all three times... but what really bothers me is that when ever I had to do a speech before, I was writing it whail everyone else was presenting theirs, and I would blow through it like nothing, and I would pass.&nbsp; So that kinda bothered me.. maybe I've been away from scool to long to do this without getting scared... and I had nothing to be scared about... grrr..

						     so.. today was our last day of school.. I don't think I will miss it.. I was getting really tired.&nbsp; We went on our last bus trip.&nbsp; I fell asleep again cause I stayed up till 2.&nbsp; Jeff's shoulder really is comfy.. it made me happy when he rested his head on mine.. I don't know why I was happy about that.&nbsp;&nbsp; But then I got sick.. my stomach hurt so bad.. it was hot out and I was freezing, but when I put on my dress shirt I was too hott.&nbsp; Jeff was so sweet, he sat down with me and asked me if I was okay, then if I was sure that I was okay.. and I know that just seems like something everyone would say, but he said it in that "I-truly-care" rather then "I-just-want-to-know" kinda way.   There was this little kid in a tree, Jeff and I noticed that the branches were extreamly thin.  This kid seemed like he wanted attention, he was bouncing up and down yelling "no!' I was sure it was going to break. Stephany(sp?) and Kristen walked over to see if he needed help, and tried to get him to come down.  when he tried, a branch broke (not all the way) and he slipped off and must have fell bout 3-4 feet, whail I was running over to get him. (this didn't help my stomach at all.. made it a lot worse) then I helped him down. This kid was about five, and I guess he had a house in the park..   I think it would be fun to live there, it was really pretty. My fav. spot of all that we have gone to.  That's where we took our final. I wanted my camera.. because we were all sitting in a play ground, like.. on the swings, or monkey bars, or slides.. and we're all teens.. like.. no time to play.. everyone doing work whail they are in a play place.  It was kinda neat to me.  Jeff and his&nbsp;dad brought me home to pick up my note book, and then brought me back to school ( forgot it at home)&nbsp; that was nice of them. His dad's name is steve and his mom's is wendy... I"m only putting that so I remember.&nbsp; They were willing to wait for me to turn it all in, but I had to organize it all.. and that took a long time cause I couldn't think.. I called my friend Mark to see if he could meet me half way home, but he couldn't hear me well for some reason. &nbsp;when I was walking down the hall way to go home.. I cried cause it hurt so bad (so you sorta get the idea of how it was)&nbsp; on my way home, I almost lost my doughnut a few times (bout four) and almost fell down several times.&nbsp; Then I got home and slept for a few hours, mark called, and I told him what happened.. he felt kinda bad, cause he would have come to get me if he knew I was sick.&nbsp; Then I slept a little more.. then beth got home, andI was sitting in the office, she was on the phone.. I got up and was about to walk around the staircase to get to the kitchen.&nbsp; All the colors blured and turned black, it actually felt like someone was pushing on my eyes.&nbsp; Then I lost ballace.. almost fell but grabed hold of the stair handrail.&nbsp; Then beth (sister) ordered me to not go to my friends concert... and I was feeling almost better when everyone was leaving... but Mark thought it would be better if I stayed home, incase I had a relaps... so now I'm here typing to blog, and Jeff.

						   Today I went to Talburt with Jeff... I told him there was nothing to do, so we got to hiking, and got tired really fast... it was too hot.. but then he had to do chores, so he couldn't stay with me to have a fudge cicle(sp?) AWWWW.. I wanted him to stay with me.. but I guess that's okay.. he had a lot to do. So I hung out with Mark, I like hanging out with Mark, but I want to get to know Jeff better.. he seems like one of the very few guys I know who doesn't hang out with me with alternant motives. so he's good  Mark went to a barba q with me tonight, I was happy he went, I would have been so bored.. and annoyed.. one of my younger cousins is so self centered and bossy, and I'm her fav. cousin.. that makes it worse. There were a lot of people there:  Uncle Jim (dad's brother), Dot (Jim's girlfriend), Shelby (bossy daughter of Jim), Uncle Paul (dad's brother), Aunt wendy (Paul's wife), Justin and Missy (feturnal twin children of Paul and Wendy), Jaden (eldest sone of Paul and Wendy, Ryan (my bro), Beth (my sis), Uncle Scott (dad's brother), Aunt Kris (Scotts devorced wife), Robert and Christopher (sons of Scott and kris), Jamie (Eldest eldest child of Scott and chris), Ryan (Jamie's new bf), Grandma and grandpa (dad's parents), dad, mom, me, and mark  WOW  okay, now I want to look at parts of Jeff's journal that make me feel special, heheh:   July 11th 2004   Today, our bus ride was about an hour and a half, and we were all tired, and Jenny put her head on my shoulder and fell asleep. It was cute as hell.   July 13th 2004   I'm with Jenny, which is neat   July 14th 2004   Jenny walked over to Safeway to grab some lunch. I should've gone with her. But nope, I'm lazy and tired of walking in the hot hot sunshine, and I needed to type this out, because I'm a slave to my blog.   July 15th 2004   And I'm finally going to go to Talbert with Jenny, after three weeks of delaying it and delaying it and delaying it.   July 16th 2004   (this one really made me feel special)  Jenny freaked me out for a little bit. She was having a stomach ache and it looked like it was really hurting her. But you know what? That didn't stop her from saving some kid's life. Okay, maybe he wasn't going to die, but she saved him from getting scratched up. There was this kid -five years old, as he would later tell us- jumping up and down on the really thin branches of this tree a ways away from where our class was. He was yelling, too. Not urgent "Help me!" yelling, just sort of "Hey, look, I'm in a tree! I want attention for my god-like feat!" yelling. After a couple minutes of that, Stephanie and Kristin walked over to see if he needed help getting down. After about ten seconds of them talking to him, Jenny stood up (we were sitting in the shade over by the playground) and started running over to the kid, and seriously, right when she stood up, the kid fell about three feet on to some lower branches.   Like a superhero, she jumped through the branches over to the trunk of the tree and helped the little guy down on to safe ground. Turns out his parents owned the campground, or something, so I'm sure he was used to being up in trees.    July 17th 2004   (I told you I was right)  I went over to Talbert with Jenny after I got home. She was right when she said there wasn't much to do. We hiked around a little bit, and it was pretty out there, but just to hot and humid for hiking.      SO yeah.. I have no idea why I like being talked about in his blog.. but it makes me feel special. but yeah.. heheh..   Scott just told me Jeff was a pirate... heheehehe..... erg.. speaking of Jeff to much.. when I meet someone new... I tend to talk bout them a lot

						     I am so eff'ing sore! my dad has a shop, and he puts together displays.. right? well.. this job includes so many standing up jobs.. I just hit a 12 hour shift (including lunch and break) I feel like I just ran disney land all day.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I guess it's an overly fair trade.. cause I get 7.50 an hour.. and I don't have to pay taxes, so I get the full 7.50, I'm saving for a computer.. I've gotten 20 hours so far.. and my mom owes me 40 $ alounce(sp?) cause she forgot to give it to me the past few weeks (even though I asked) so I"m at.. about 191 $ which is&nbsp; 12.73% of my goal YEYEYEY, and I'm working again 2morrow.. but I have to let my bro work too.. but I don't think he wants to cause of the heat.. so it's all good.. I should get my money.. I need (without allounce (save for the 40 that I am owed)) approx. 22 more days of work... but I get 10 $ every monday if I do my chores.. so..... hmmm.. If I work every day.. I duno..I'll figure it out later..

I was really excited that I was gonna get to see Mark.. then my parents decided to leave work an hour 1/2 later then they said(6).... so I would get 2 hours to see Mark from then (20 min trip to home).. that was okay.&nbsp; then we went to taco bell drive through.. taking away bout 10 min.&nbsp; then we went to eat it at gpa's house..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taking away time till 9 :10.. so 20 min drive from there is home...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my parents decide then to go to home depot.. when there excuse to leave gpa's house was cause I was "dying to see Mark"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that took another 20 min or so ...&nbsp; then they have to go pick up ryan from ericks..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got back 2 min&nbsp;till ten..&nbsp; then I"m walking up to go to the house .. my mom says hi sweety.. and I swear that I thought she was talking to the cat, so I didn't answer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then I saw the cat next to me, oh, she was talking to me.. she asks me if some thing is wrong.. I say no...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some how.. .that means I got into a fit&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm on the coutch writing, and I'm about to get up to go take a shower.. she comes out of her room.. sits on coutch.. I don;t leave, cause I don't want her to think I"m leaving cause she sat down.&nbsp;she&nbsp;&nbsp;says, well I would have let you go see him if you didn't get into that fit out there .&nbsp; and I tried to explain that is wasn't a fit.. I thought she was&nbsp; talking to the cat..&nbsp;&nbsp; so.. she didn't let me see him.. and I got really upset.. cause I really was so excited.. and then I got let down... to I went to the bathroom.. I started crying as I got ready to shower.. when I got into the shower.. I had to sit down.. I was sitting for a god 10-15 min before I could stop crying and take a shower... I have almost no idea why it was so important for me to see him, but it was.. I think it might have been cause I havn;t seen him or any of my other friends for 2 days.. (I'm not used to that) and I got so excited to see him, knowing I would.. I prob would't have cried if when I knew I was going to see him, I knew that I wasn't .going to..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then my mom starts sucking up to me... she gave me red vines.. which I like.. but dont want to eat them.. so I"m going to leave them here on the computer table for her to eat 2morrow..&nbsp; but then she acusses me of taking a bag of candy from her box.. that she gave me to share with my friends... but I told her that. and she was okay.. it's just the acussing without understanding part that is bothering me.. grr.. now she's in bed.. and I want to go see mark... I;m sad

						     An update to myself... so far, I am at 55 hours... YEYEYEY.. then I'll have another 7 (AT LEAST) by the end of today... so that is.... 62 hours.... $465, then the $50 my mom owes me = $515, + the $42 in my account ( I know.. that's weak.. but I spend money real fast) = that's $557... but I will prob get at least 8 hours today, making it a total of $564.5        &nbsp;    I will also be working till at least Sat. and it's crunch time.. so I will prob be getting longer days.... meaning... by the end of sat. if I only get 8 hours a day,, I will have&nbsp; $684.5 (YEYEYEYEYEY) which is 45.63% of the 1500        &nbsp;    YEYEYYEYEYEYE COMPUTER!!!!!! MUHAHAHHAHAHHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!        &nbsp;    alrighty then.. on another note.. yesterday, Mark and I worked on our candel... and I burned my hand... it hurt... not really burned.. like... blisters.... just getting a bunch of hot wax spilt on my hand by me... yes.. by me... the me who is graceful enough to trip on the side walk seams... yeah.. that me..        &nbsp;    I'm kinda tired of working.. but.. I prob wouldn't be doing much at home anyways.. but this way I'll get my comp.. I thought about just working.. and getting my comp later... but I think it'll be easier to get right now.. cause I don't earn money at half rate like other jobs would have for me... so I would get the money faster.. and not have as much of a chance to spend it all... YEYEYEY COMPUTA!!!!!!!        &nbsp;      &nbsp;      &nbsp;

						     So I found out this was sorta my fault... that friend.. when he was going out with his previous gf.. we had a tickle fight, he told me it was kinda awkward cause he had a girlfriend..... some how I ended up telling my other friend... but... there was no importance to it.. so I didn't think anything of it...  so he's (the 2nd friend) talking to the girlfriend (of the first friend), she says she would never do anything with him (the second friend), and he says he wouldn't with her (the first friends girl friend), but the bf came close once with a prev. gf, but he doesn't think he ever would... (said by the second friend)  he (2nd) was talking about our tickle fight (of me and the 1st) .. nothing happened.. nothing came close to happening.. I don't see how this started so much..  and naturally, the bf blew things way out of porpotion.. again.. and thought that the gf had lost a big chunk of trust in him.. she hadn't... she didn't even want him to mention it...  the only thing I said, that bothered her was was I told her bout when we went on the roof and he blew up his fire crackers.. (they went up there and did "stuff stuff") she didn't like that it wasn't a couple of guys that he used to go up there with when he was young and the tree wasn't so hard to climb.. pretending it happened a while ago.. she thought maybe he had taken other girls (me) up there to do "stuff" I cleared that up, and told her that I never did anything with him beyond kissing.. and we didn't do that up there.. so she's okay with that... she wasn't happy that he lied.. he made it seem that it happened so long ago when he went up there.. as far as I know.. he's only been up there once.. and the first time was with me, we didn't do anything up there but run around.. try to find a way to the top.. have our routine tickle fight.. then he blew up fire crakers.. that didn't happen that long ago..              I"m not that happy right now, really.. the 2rd person should have never said that to the gf.. and the Bf.. should have not blown things up... and I really think he should have told me what was going on...    I'm not that happy that the bf got me all worked up.. I didn't do anything.. but share an happening with a friend(telling the 2nd) .. it was nothing, and had no meaning.. but some how I said somthing very private.... that.. wasn't private.. and things got messed up.. I wonder how this is all gonna work out... (he meaning the bf) if he's gonna feel bad.. or even want to say sorry    damn... there are bugs.. like.. everywhere.. every night I sit at this comp.. bugs.. like.. little bettles, I have squashed 7 tonight.. and there goes another...  night all

						     I'm so confused... aparently.... I said somthing to a friends girlfriend... about his previouse girlfriend... and she lost a lot of trust in him.. he's out of town till wed.... then if I don't find out what it is by myself.. or from her.. then he'll talk to me bout it face to face.. I"m scared... really.. I am... I was shaking.. and my heart was beating so fast... I don't know why... I"m sooooo confused... =-( I really want to know whats going on... I asked if this was going to hurt our friendship.. and he said that was up to me.. but I don't know what I said...... HELP!!!!! I feel like I"m going to die...

						     I know that the title isn't quite as random as the others.. but it's based on how I feel right now... I'm tired of saying good bye to a friend who I will miss so much that I break the promise to let him go.. I'm tired of not knowing what I have done... I'm tired of knowing that I will try again to be friends with him... nothing got better last night.. I tried to explain to him what happened in an e-mail.. but it only got worse.. I"m tired of trying, and only finding him unwilling to understand.. I still have no idea what I have done.. or what points he has been trying to make.. what am I supposed to learn from this?  today was so depressing, he said that now he can't trust someone.. I'm so confused.. why is he talking about me like I broke some sacred trust... I never said anything to hurt his relationship.. as far as I know.. I'm so confused..  Today I spent the day with Mark and the friends girlfriend.. and the bf wasn't very happy that she was with us...  I wan't to talk to him.. but I"m scared..  I know he doesn't want to talk to me.. but.. I want this to end.. with me at least knowing how this started.... seeing as he has already claimed it's end.. and that he thinks he made his points.. but... all I got out of it was that I'm a shit head of a friend.. and I don't know exactly why.... =-(

						     so.. nothing between me and my friend has been fixed... nothing has even been said... I was so depressed yesterday.. but I talked it out with my friend Scott... I guess I needed to talk to someone who is outside the whole problem... it made me feel so much better.. cause I was being such a jerk to my other friend.. and yeah.. now it's all better.. for that part... ... I want things to be better.. but I don't want this to happen again....  I'm going to just leave him alone till he decides to talk... if he goes on being an ass.. I'll insert the im's and e-mails in here, without changing the name to BF... because I will be angery at him.. VERY ANGERY... prob not.. just sad..

						       Don't anyone ever call me a goddess.. someone did once.. and that was a huge turn off.. and I didn't like it.. and it was creepy.. but I tried to be nice a bout it.. that's hard... (not trying to be mean.. if you were that person)      You are Form 1,  Goddess : The Creator.  "And The Goddess planted the acorn of life. She cried a single tear and shed a single drop of blood upon the earth where she buried it. From her blood and tear, the acorn grew into the world."  Some examples of the Goddess Form are Gaia (Greek), Jehova (Christian), and Brahma (Indian).The Goddess is associated with the concept of creation, the number 1, and the element of earth.Her sign is the dawn sun. As a member of Form 1, you are a charismatic individual and people are drawn to you. Although sometimes you may seem emotionally distant, you are deeply in tune with other people's feelings and have tremendous empathy. Sometimes you have a tendency to neglect your own self. Goddesses are the best friends to have because they're always willing to help.   urlLink  Which Mythological Form Are You?    brought to you by          You're Exotic Dancer Barbie.

						    urlLink     You are orange. You are emotional. Outside, you are bitter and stubborn, inside you are hopeful, hoping someone will come save you from the bitterness of your own mind. You constantly feel the need to prove yourself, and you look up to those who can make thier dreams happen. You are broken, but not beyond repair like maroon.   What inner color are you?

						      I was looking at my friends journal... just to take a peek at the past part of his life.. and I found this.. I don't know if he wrote it.. but I dun think he did.. and this is how I feel right now.. I don't want to...     such an appropriate song..  .life it seems will fade away drifting farther every day getting lost within myself nothing matters no one else i have lost the will to live simply nothing more to give there is nothing more for me need the end to set me free things arent what they used to be missing one inside of me deathly lost this cant be real cannot stand this hell i feel emptyness is filling me to the point of agony growing darkness taking dawn i was me but now hes gone no one but me can save myself but its too late now i cant think, think why i should even try yesterday seems as though it never existed death greets me warm, now i will just say goodbye

						     okay.. I'm kinda sad that my blogger thing-e-ma-jig hasn't been working at all!!!  update  I recently got a pet spider, I named him Ralf. I just made him a new home in a big pickle jar.. I found him in my bathtub.  on Saturday, was the summer haven at the Milwalkiee prespitarian church (charles' church) I won a CD player.. that was cool.. Mark got some bass srings, but gave them to nick... cause.. what is Nick gonna do with them that Mark can't without equipment? string it to his bass.. alrighty!!!!! awesome.. the haven was awesome.. but they had a car bash, and the night before.. the peeps who participated in providing the haven for everyone, broke out all the windows.. so there was glass everywhere.. there was little boy wanting to dunk someone in the dunk tank.. but all of the worker people were just getting dried off after beeing cold.. so I immidiatly, without thinking, voulenteered.. Mark ended up doing it with me.. I got so wet.. so I was walking around wet.. with no shoes (I got some tickets to participate in the games for doing the tank) and I got glass in my feet and didn't know it.. till I played DDR.. I got one out of my left foot.. but the other foot.. the glass sliver had to be pulled out by some unknown lady with nails.. cause Jane (charles' mom) couldn't find any tweezers till right after the lady got it out  Today.. my dad found a dragonfly on the ground just as I saw it.. .. the thing is.. it was only the head and belly and wings and feets.. I asumed that he got hit by one of the celine (sp) fans.. and later.. I was wondering where his butt was.. I looked near where we found his frount half.. and I found his butt.. I was trying to pick it up.. and it started wiggling like crazy, starled me.. and I let out a litttle yipe.... .. and this was before lunch.. and its still wiggling.. for about 10 hours it's been wiggling..  I was promised a short work day today.. so I was happy... but it ended up being a 10 1/2 hour day... and I was sick.. and I had a head ach.. and I was tired.. I fell asleep several times whail drilling those damn nikie displays togther.. I don't like those displays.. same with the safeway displays GRRR!  but what's cool is.. I saw the displays in the store the other day (the ones advertising the air plane miles.. and the safeway club thing with the brocher things) so that was cool seeing something I made be in stores..  Keighla and Nick went to his Gpa's house to do the harvest thing he does every year.. he gets money.. but he was getting jelouse that Mark and I were playing with her whail he was away.. so he took her back up with him after his little break to play the haven show
