      So what exactly makes a really great RPG? Is it the length? Story? Personally, I could care less about the length, but story is key. And a big part of that story is the ending. It's great when a great game that you struggle through has a totally kick ass ending. That's why Nintendo is automatically out. Their games never have good endings. Yes, they end but the payoff is horrid. So here's my favorite three RPG's and the reasoning behind them.  In first place - Final Fantsy 7 By far the best in the series, this game stands out mostly because it is the first 'next gen' Final Fantasy. This game rocks. I had it before I even had my Playstation. You could say I bought the PS just for this game. It's a perfect length and it left the end open to be continued, which I am so stoked for Advent Children.   In a VERY close second - Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic This game was perfectly balanced and a fun time to play. It wasn't too hard yet had plenty to do. I of course went to the dark side. It was great to have that choice. I loved extorting people for their money. Though the ending was short, the story in this game made all else seem trivial. With such a great plot twist, this is what these games are all about.  In third place - Kingdom Hearts Most people never expected much from this game, and truth be told I expected something more like Mario RPG with Disney characters. Words fail me to describe what a treat this game turned out to be. It has excelent sound and level design and was easy to pick up and play. Looking forward to the two sequels and find myself wondering if Eisner is still planning to do something with this as planned earlier, like a series or a movie. How bad would that damage the reputation of the game?

      I have come to this realization that women love the idea of romance more than they like actually finding a romantic. See, women seem to have this whole fairy tale view on life and love. It's like a holy grail for them. But when actually faced with a guy that is a true romantic, they don't know what to do. The reality is that they would rather have a guy that sits around like a loaf on a couch than one who can sweep them off their feet regularly without prompting. This confuses me. Why would anyone chose an unapreciative guy over one who cares enough to be romantic, the one who isn't afraid to be that way. A man is not defined by the way he sits around and does nothing. A true man is comfortable with himself and has the ability to display his emotions. So why reject the fairy tale when it becomes a reality?

      The weirdest thing happened today. Actually two weird things happened to day. Well one was weird and one was not too surprisng.  First, Bobby came up to me during break and started talking about what Miss Kelly had told us about love and all that. He wanted to know what I thought about it. I told him it kind of scared me to think of love. It is supposed to be this serious thing and I wasn't sure I would recognize it if it hit me in the face. He told me he agreed, but he thinks he knows he is in love. He is just too worried to tell he person. We were intterupted before we could finish by Erin.  Before I go on let me tell you the story about Erin. She is the crazy one of us. When she was smaller she swore she saw something in the sky one evening as the folk was setting. She said it looked like a small dot tearing the sky in half. All of us thought she was crazy but the instructors took her aside for a while after that. Erin never talked about it anymore after that, but we all felt she was crazy. It wasn't until she moved in with us that we weren't afraid of catching something from her.  So Erin runs up and grabs my hand and drags me away. She beckons for Bobby to follow. She leads us to the garden area where we have a good look at the water beyond. I love the water. Such a beautiful green like the sky. We are learning about all the mysteries of whats inside it in our newer lessons on nature. But the view was marred by Erin forcing me to look to the horizon. She was pointing out silently and Bobby was speechless. I looked and gasped for there on the horizon was a black dot&nbsp;slashing the sky in half. It was something that left a trail much like that from the puffy&nbsp;dogs that&nbsp;glide across the sky. All at once I was terrified. The thing moved so quickly. Bobby was the first to speak. He said 'Great Erin, you gave us crazy.' and she snapped at him. Erin wasn't crazy. We decided not to tell anyone yet on Erin's orders.&nbsp;She told us she would tell us more later.  I can't get that image out of my mind. It is almost like my writting assignment, something unknown yet familiar. I need to get my mind off of things. It is racing to the stories from childhood of monsters. I will think about our trip to the animal stockade tomorrow. I can't wait to see the felps. I love the felps with their feathers and their clucking. Though I don't much care for felp eggs.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      So&nbsp;I sat down after lesons to work on my writting assignment. I can see these things when I close my eyes and think. They look like giant rocks that glitter in the sun and reach into the sky. Not only that, it is like there are boats&nbsp;moving on smooth paths. I wonder if I shouldn't just make something up or do this and sound crazy. &nbsp; We learned to day about love from&nbsp;Miss Kelly. Susan from the other&nbsp;bungalow asked about it. She wanted to know what it was. We see it in the pictures and stories we read left behind by those before us. Miss Kelly put it simply - love is a feeling between two people that goes beyond friendship.&nbsp;So Bobby asked does it matter who the people are. Miss Kelly said it doesnt, but only a man and a woman can have a child. That is how we are all created. She said it was as good of a place as any to start learning about sex. Little does she know&nbsp;what&nbsp;some of us do on the private beach. Alan wanted to know&nbsp;why two guys couldn't have a baby. Miss Kelly said she would explain it in a minute, but to not assume ever that a man and a man or a woman and a woman could not love each other in that special way.&nbsp;She then continued on her lecture and promised we would come back to this subject later. &nbsp; I am afraid of love. I don't know what it is. Now that I think about it,&nbsp;where do all the younger kids come from? It seem like they come out that big from girls. Man it must hurt if they do. &nbsp; I'm going to go write my project now. It is late and Bobby and Erin can not stop talking about their boat idea. Erin calls it a 'sailboat'. Don't know why or where she got it from, but it seems to fit.&nbsp;

      Yesterday was an interesting day. We met all of our new level instructors. I liked Miss. Kelly the best. She will be teaching us biology. Other than that yesterday was just a normal day. One of our new teachers is Jonas. He has given us a week to write something imaginative. He told us to close our eyes and write about what we see. After classes I tried to work it out. When I close my eyes I see giant rocks that reach into the sky. I guess it doesn't sound like much but I am going to try again later. I do have a week to deal with this. &nbsp; The most interesting thing to happen was late last night. Bobby woke me in the middle of the night to take me outside. He told me to follow him and we ended up by the water. It was a peaceful night and Bobby whispered to me. He said he had an idea on finding another island. He said we were going to use a boat. That's when Erin showed up. She followed us and she was laughing about Bobby's idea. She said the boats need paddles and we would exhaust ourselves before we got too far. Bobby just smiled and hushed us all. He said listen and feel. We did. It was silent and a gentle wind was blowing. Bobby smiled. I got it right away. The wind! When we were kids we made flyers on strings that the wind controlled. We could guide them with a simple pull of the string. Bobby spoke and said we need to find a way to use the wind on a boat so we could go farther out to sea than we could before. Erin liked the idea. So do I. But how do we do it? &nbsp; We heard someone in the distance moving around and we snuck home quickly. I could not sleep for the rest of the night and now I am really tired, but we have a rec day today so at least there are no lessons for me today. &nbsp; I wonder if Bobby can find a way to make the boat.

      My instructor told us today he wanted us to keep a thing called a diary. He told us it was a way for us to record our thoughts and what we learn. He told us we should start it with an entry about who we are and where we are at in our life. &nbsp; My name is Tim. I am 15. I, like all the others, live on an island. All of us are grouped by our ages. I am in the group almost at the top. There are other islands out there but we have never seen them or heard from them. My friend Bobby has been trying to find a way to locate another island since we were kids. Bobby is my best friend. We have lived in the same bungalow since we were in the younger group. Our bungalo consists of me, Bobby, Trevor, Lucy, Amanda, Adam, Erin and Beth. There are other&nbsp;bungalo's like ours so those in it get shifted around occassionally when we move up to an older bungalo. Bobby has been the only one with me since the early years. Erin is the next oldest friend I have. You could saw the three of us are insperable. &nbsp; We all attend lessons at the center every day. There are different instructors who teach us different things, like sciece and math. We are encouraged to figure things out on our own most of the time. The instructors are more like guides. We attend lessons every morning after breakfast. &nbsp;We have a meal break in the middle of the day and end our lessons shortly after that. In the afternoons we hang out. There are gyms and study areas located around the island. The island itself is not all that big, but it is large enough for all of us. There are roughly 100 of us here. I wonder if the other islands are bigger than ours. Bobby better come up with a way to find one soon. &nbsp; I spend my evenings alone for the most part. It is how I unwind from the day. When I have free time Bobby and I play on a sports team. We play Sphere. Sphere is a game where we run around kicking a ball into netted off areas of our opponets side of the field. I love Sphere. Bobby is a little better at it though. Our team is called the Sharks.  &nbsp; So that about sums it up.&nbsp;Looks like I completed Mr. Jameson's first assignment. This diary might be a good idea. I am excited about&nbsp;our new lessons. We were promised they would be more challenging and in depth&nbsp;from here on. The sky is turning a brilliant dark green now. I love the green sky. It is beautiful. But now it is getting dark and it is almost time for lights out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
