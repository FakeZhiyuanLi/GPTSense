      well today my mom told me that  is shouldnt be writing what i do on the internet but i dont care what she thinks? Do you care what your mom thinks? she said that people sit on the internet all day just tring to figure out who we(bloggers)are.i thought to my self that this lady is losing her mind. but she is my mom and i have to do what she says.NOT!!! i aint listening to her until i get my birthday gift. my dads house is looking alot better to me after putting up with my mom for the past 9 years. i should have lived with him every since they separated.

      ok today i got some stuff to say. it all started when i went to go put some air in a bike tire. i asked my step dad where the pump was, he said that it was under the table in the storage room. so i went to pump the tire but it had a huge hole in the tire so the air wouldnt stay in so i said forget it. then when i came back into the house to tell him iwas leaving he told me to hold the phone for him while he looked for some numbers. when he came back, i told him i was leaving. then he says ok.  when i came back the garage was down and he was not there. so here i am locked out. so i go to my friends house and stay there for a while so i could call my sister to let me in.  somehow my mom gets a call saying that i locked out so now she trippin about me leaving w/o telling my stepdad. i the one who cant remember shit and just lied on me. so now i am on lock down for who knows how long. aint that a bitch?

      a normal snday at Mr. Johnsons place went as usual. my dad left me at home with his fiancee.(i think thats how you spell it.) we went and chilled at her sons house. Her son bootlegs movies and cd's. she is a lawyer.(i thought the apple didnt fall far from the tree.) her other son is in the army. he got this phat azz truck with some 26's that keep on spinning. 3 tv's and this loud stereo system.man.that was the tightest truck i have been in in a while. but any way, we went to the mall like we always do when i come over here. i am going to kj's tomorrow to get me some girbauds and some other stuff. it comes cheap when you know the man that owns the place. well that about all my sunday was cut out to be. except for the fact that i had to watch 4 bad azz baybay kids while they were here this morning. omg. they so damn bad it dont make sense. they keep running and running and running. then they eat and run some more.i thought i was gonna pass out when they came in the door.i had just woke up and here come the freaky four comin through my door. well i will holla.                             *This blog is finsihed*

      for my birthday i went to the the coast. it woulnt have been iight if my cousin hadnt went. she is a real pain in the ass. she gets on my nerves so bad. she really burns my ass. she gets attitudes all the time and she thinks people are supposed to change for her.she gets mad when you bite your fork while eating.  what the hell is her problem?  then she lost her bible b/c she's tring to be mother teresa and shes supposed to be so holier than thou.  she was crying b/c her bible was missing. she said that the maid that cleaned the room daily. then she found it.so when she found it i was playing playstation 2(never leave without it) she threw it at me and i almost caught a case and beat her ass. but i left her alone b/c that would not be a fair fight. she is never gonna go anywhere with me over 9 hours. she said she was depressed. my mom asked why and she said " i just am" that was sooo dumb. when we got home she left and went back to her house. she called  me back and then asked me if i wanted to go on a trip to New Orleans. i damn near cussed her out on the phone. she needs to think twice before she ever calls me again.
