						   D'acc, je veux dire rapidement: je ne suis pas aussi sérieux que j'ai été dans le message dernier.  Je voulais être sérieux seulement parce que c'était mon premier message, alors je devais être assez compassé.  Dans le futur, je me serai.  Je promets.  Maintenant, je dois jouer mon tuba parce que je rivalise de "All-Region" le week-end prochain.  Je ne suis pas excité, haha.

						   Ma vie.  C'est extraordinaire à mon avis, mais quelquefois je ne le comprend pas.  En français, elle est simple.  En fait, ma vie française a commencé avec ce message.  Si ma vie anglaise était aussi simple que ma vie française, je n'aurais pas autant de problèmes que j'en ai ici.  Ce n'est pas que j'ai beaucoup de problèmes dans ma vie, mais quelquefois la vie simple semble meilleure que la vie complexe.  C'est ma déclaration au monde français: Philippe a arrivé!

						   Aujourd'hui a passé relativement tranquillement.  Rien de s'est passé, alors je vais aller directement au verbe du jour: bercer, ce qui veut dire en anglais "to soothe or lull," et, intransatifement et avec "de" veut dire "to delude oneself with."  Je crois qu'il est intéressant que beaucoup de personnes se bercent de la croyance que nous, les personnes que vont au Lycée Midway, ne devons pas travailler dur pour arriver au endroit où nous voulons être.  Ce n'est pas juste vis-à-vis de les personnes que travaillent dur et essayent d'avoir succès fou.  Telles illusions ne pouvent pas être bonnes.

						   Aujourd'hui je vais essayer d'utiliser des mots et des expressions de  urlLink french.about.com  a fin que je puisse étendre mon étendue du vocabulaire et du langue française.  Aujourd'hui, nous nous chargeons de expressions avec le verbe "dire."  Alors...  Aujourd'hui j'ai su qu'à San Antonio, nous a laissé une personne au Alamo.  C'aura été effrayant d'étant laissé dans une ville grande.  La manière que mon ami Taylor m'a dit que nous étions laissé une personne, c'était plûtot drôle:  "Dis donc, j'ai su que nous sommes laissé une personne au Alamo."  Bien que ce n'aie pas été très amusant en réalité, j'ai cru que c'était.  Cepandant, je m'ai rendu compte dont les professeurs d'espagnole pourraient s'attirer des ennuis pour l'être laissé.  J'avais l'hostilité que quelque chose comme cela arriverait, mais je connaissais que je ne devais pas dire "Je te l'avais dit."  Cela aurait été très mal à mon avis.  Quand même, je ne dis pas non que c'était, comment dirais-je?  Je sais.  Mal.  Ceci dis, je crois que nous avons beaucoup de professeurs dédié, et cela, à mon avis, est beaucoup dire.

						   Je suis revenu de l'école, et je suis fatigue.  Je ne crois pas avoir fait beaucoup de choses (bien que ce soit vrai), mais je m'ai senti fatigue tous la journée.  Le vendredi le club d'espagnol va aller en San Antonio pour que manger, bien s'amuser, et jouir de la culturelle de la ville.  Quelle excité!  Je suis très excité de faire ça, mais quand même je dois aller à l'école.  Quelle...excit...ça ne fait rien.

						   Donc, rien de se passe aujourd'hui, mais c'est bien.  Nous ne avons rien fait dans les classes, à part beaucoup de rien.  Dans l'espagnole, mes camarades de classe ont recevu leurs chamises du club d'espagnol.  Je n'en ai pas acheté l'une, alors je ne sais pas faire le vendredi pendant le voyage.  Il ne m'importe pas.  Un jour faits, il n'en reste plus que beacoup :-(

						   Cette journé n'en avait rien de spécial.  Aller à l'école n'est pas interessant à mon avis, mais je trouve du réconfort dans savoir que je reste ici pour seulement une année et demie avant que j'aille au collège.  Je sais que quand j'y irai, je serai heureux, ou au moins plus heureux que je suis maintenant.  Ce n'est pas que je ne suis pas heureux ici, mais...je crois être plus heureux là.  Je suis heureux voir mes amis parce que je ne leur ai pas vu pour les vacances entieres.  Quelle triste, non?  Cepandant, cela ne me fait aimer l'école plus, mais ce m'aide.  Autre jour passé...¿Qu'est-ce que demain tenira?

						   Je suppose qu'il est le temps dans que je dois écrire sur ma blague.  Depuis plusieurs de mois que j'écris sur cette blague bien que j'y aie vu pour plusieurs de semaines.  Ma vie est, simplement, des montagnes après d'autres, et je n'aime pas cela.  C'est moi qui ai fait cela, mais c'est difficile d'accepter cela parce que tout le temps j'aime projeter sur autre chose que, en realitie, n'y est pour rien.  Mais assez de mes problèmes!  Je voudrais écrire de bon temps, ne pas des mauvaises.   Aujourd'hui, j'ai commencé mon huitième entraînement des nouvelles recrues dans le Young Marines.  Toute la journée, je hurlais à les recrues jusqu'à il semble que ma voix me cesserait de parler pour la reste de la journée.  C'est ma vie actuelle.  J'éspère que je peux écrire sur ma blague plus souvent, mais je ne sais pas.  Le temps passe très vite, alors...Jusqu'à la fois prochaine!

						   Je vais écrire en français aujourd'hui parce que je sens "français."  C'est-à-dire, je n'ai pas envie d'écrire ni en anglais ni en espagnole, alors je vais écrire en français, d'acc?  D'acc.  Bien, je suis très heureux que ma vie aille bien actuellement.  Je peux parler en français assez bien, et j'ai des amis qui sont les meilleures qui soit dans le monde.  Ce soir, je vais aller chez Rachel pour aider elle, Emily et Alec à faire des posters pour le dîner international qui passe le jeudi.  Au moins, c'est ce que je crois que nous allons faire, mais on ne peut jamais savoir.  Vraiment, je n'ai pas beaucoup de choses pour dire, mais je ne veux que dire que j'aime ma vie, et j'espère qu'elle ne deviens que mieux!  La vie, c'est très bonne!

						   Je m'étonne qu'un peu de temps puisse être une éternité en termes d'étudier une langue étranger.  Ce week-end a été incroyable pour ce qui est de tel étudier (je crois que dire mal ça).  Néanmoins, je suis contente avec le fait que j'ai appris beaucoup de choses du français ce week-end.  C'est ce que j'ai fait tout le week-end (avec mon nouveau chanson pour mon grand-père), et je suis fier d'avoir passer mon temps en faisant des choses que se rapportent au français.  J'ai travaillé sur les aspects de la grammaire, sur écouter, et un peu de lire.  J'éspère que bientôt je verrai des effects de mes efforts d'apprendre la langue, et j'en vois déjà quelques-uns.  Ma vie française, c'est très bonne!  Viviez les Français (et non, je ne suis pas "non-Americain," comme certains diraient; j'aime toutes les cultures).

						   Quelle semaine!  Malgré avoir dû être avec mes amis tout le temps, je m'ai bien amusé.  Le lundi, on fait du bowling, lequel a été très amusant bien que notre amie Rachel a eu un accident.  Elle était douloureuse, elle était vivant.  Je crois que j'ai oblié ce qu'on a fait le lundi, mais le mercredi on est allé chez Rachel pour manger les desserts que les jeunes filles ont préparé.  Aussi on a joué des jeux de Rachel et a régardé la télé.  C'était très amusant et il a rapporté à moi que j'ai plusieurs d'amis qui m'aiment.  Le jeudi on a pris des photos dans nos chamises de Corrigan chez Emily (Bivona).  J'ai dû emmener Rachel chez Emily après d'avoir m'occuper de si ma mère arriverait à l'heure, mais il est arrivé, alors on y est allé.  Il y a eu le concurs de Mr. Midway.  Je ne pouvait pas aller parce que ma mère m'a telephoné pour me dire que j'ai dû retourner à la maison pour que mon père aie pu changer un mauvais pneu.  Néanmoins, le vendredi, ou hier, on est allé chez Emily (Sadler) pour prendre des photos.  Vraiment, on n'en a pris pas, mais notre ami Taylor l'a fait.  Il neigeait un peu hier, alors il faisait froid, mais on s'a bien amusé.  Après de prendre les photos, on est allé chez Jenny et a amené pleusiers de gens d'autres.  On a regardé deux films ( American Wedding  et  Fright Night ), alors on s'a amusé.  Je suis assez fatigue maintenant, alors je vais arrêter.  Jusqu'à la fois prochaine!

						   Cette semaine s'appelle Corrigan, et je ne sais pas exactement ce qu'il veut dire.  Néanmoins, il a été très amusant.  Je suis avec mes amis, et à cause de cela, je suis heureux, particulièrement car je ne vois guère jamais un ami.  Donc, je suis excité!  J'éspère que la cuisine est bonne ce soir, mais je ne sais pas.  Elle pourrait être très mauvaise, ou elle pourrait être très bonne.  Je crois qu'ésperer jusqu'à on arrive chez Rachel, où nous mangerons jusqu'à nous ne puissons (non?) plus.  C'est tout!

						   C'est un week-end très bon à mon avis parce que j'ai pris l'examen de SAT et je crois l'avoir bien fait.  Aussi je ne suis pas allé aux Young Marines parce que je ne pensait pas avoir assez de temps.  Peut-être que ce soit une excuse, mais je ne crois que oui.  J'ai travaillé dur pendant les semaines passées, et je merite un arrêt, ne pensez-vous pas?  Demain je retrouve Alec pour étudier français.  Cela m'étonnait parce que je ne m'attendais pas à faire rien comme cela avec lui, au moins.  J'espère que ça veut dire que l'on va se retourner à notre amitié du passé.  J'ai senti que nous la perdons je ne sais pourquoi.  En tout cas, demain, c'est un nouveau jour.  Si je ne pourrais que m'en souvenir.

						   Je ne veux que rester chez moi et m'amuse à ne faire rien, savez-vous?  Je reviendrai demain aux choses scolaires dont je plains souvent.  Le fait, c'est que je ne m'y amuse jamais.  Bien...pas jamais mais près.  Je dois revenir aux devoirs, aux sens, aux mil choses qui ne me plaîtent plus jamais.  Pourquoi plains-je tout le temps?  C'est parce que je suis fatigue de rester à un lieu où je ne veux pas être, savez-vous?  C'est que je veux être ailleurs, pas ici.  C'est que je veux faire des choses qui sont incroyables et spéciales et intéressantes, pas ce que je veux maintenant.  Je plains parce que je n'ai pas de meilleur chose de faire.  Je plains tout le temps parce que je ne peux pas changer ma situation.  elle n'est pas permanente, mais quelquefois elle semble comme cela.  Je suis jeune et tout ce que je veux, c'est dans l'avenir.  Peut-être qu'il faut trouver les bonnes choses dans le présent.  Dans une phrase, je suis frustré.  Bien, j'ai dit mon mot de tous les soirs.  J'irai demain à l'école et essayerai d'être content...peut-être ;-)

						   Nous sommes sur le point où je commençe à penser en l'école qui vient.  Je n'aime pas ce point parce que après que tout le temps que j'ai eu pour prendre des vacances, je dois revenir à les pensées de tout ce qui est de l'école.  Je pense parfois que je voudrais laisser tout mon travail et aller n'importe où.  Quand j'y arrive, je sais que je serai heureux, sans des problèmes.  Maintenant, je dois faire mes devoirs comme lire non seulement  >, mais aussi un chapitre dans mon livre d'histoire.  Je dois aussi faire du travail pour le Young Marines parce que le concours, ça vient bientôt.  Quand finira-t-il?

						   Nous sommes dans les vacances de printemps!  Je ne pourrais pas être plus heureux parce que j'ai besoin des vacances depuis le Nöel, alors je suis content d'en avoir maintenant.  Qu'est-ce que je vais faire?  Je sais pas, mais je demanderai à ma mère quand j'aie besoin de savoir.  En ce moment-ci, tout ce que je veux faire, moi, c'est simple: relâcher, dormir un peu, et étudier des choses qui je veux étudier depuis quelque temps.  Il fait nuageux, mais dans ma cœur, il fait du soleil.

						   Pas Jake Simpson!  Pourquoi?!?!?!  J'ai fini de regarder Star Search, et je mets en colère!  Jake Simpson a gagné, et pourquoi?  Sûr, il a chansé bien, mais pas aussi bien que Freedom ou Vicki.  En fait, j'aurais pris Vicki dessus Freedom, mais pas Jake.  Jake a gagné le concours dernier, et j'étais sûr qu'il ne gagnerait pas celui.  Je croyais mauvais.

						   Je suis fatigue mais je sais pas pourquoi.  Bien, je sais mais je ne veux pas dire.  Je n'aime pas qu'il y aie des choses qui sont dans ma vie que je ne veux qu'elles y soit, savez-vous?  D'acc, assez de ça.  Demain, c'est le jour de le camp de botte (je sais qu'il n'y a pas le façon que l'on le dit, mais il ne m'importe pas maintenant).  Je veux aider les jeunes à devenir Young Marines, mais il y a des choses qui m'empêchent de faire ce que je veux faire pour les faire devenir Young Marines.  C'est-à-dire, c'est difficile de travailler avec quelques-uns des gens qui travaillent aussi au camp de botte (c'est assez de ça, je vais l'appeler 'boot camp' dès maintenant).  C'est le type de personne qui me met en colère parce qu'il y a assez de diffèrences qui le font difficile de travailler envers mon but.  Je sais.  Je me plains trop, mais savez-vous quoi?  Je ne me soucie pas.

						   C'est le week-end, et je veux écrire.  Au sujet de quoi?  Je sais pas, mais il faut écrire de quelque chose.  Cette mois, c'est très dificile pour moi parce que j'ai mille choses à faire.  Le concours du Young Marine of the Year arrive bientôt.  Suis-je prêt?  Non.  M'ai-je préparé à concourir?  Non.  Il faut que j'arrête d'être paresseux et de commencer de me préparer à concourir dans une des plus importantes choses que j'ai à faire cet ans.

						   Demain est mon concert, est je n'ai pas d'instrument!  D'acc, J'ai effectivement un instrument, mais le bon, c'est dans la salle de bande.  J'en ai un qui est très mauvais, et je ne sais pas s'il jouera.  J'espère que oui, mais...de toute façon, il faudra marcher parce que je n'ai pas d'autre plan. Je suis heureux que le WYSO finit demain.  Il a été le pis semestre pour la musique.  J'aime le directeur et j'aime les peuples qui sont dans l'orchestre, mais la musique ne me plaît pas du tout.  La semaine qui vient on a les vacances des Pâques!  Elles commençent le jeudi et finissent le mardi prochain quand on doit retourner à l'école.  En realité, je n'ai pas besoin de vacances, mais je ne vais pas dire "non" quand elles viennent.  Avril, c'est une mois très occupée.  La surprise de la semaine passée était quand Monsieur Um m'ai donné une baguette après que j'ai gagné un concours pour des jeunes directeurs.  Bien sûr, j'étais étonné, mais tout est bien maintenant.  Le concert dans lequel je dirigerai sera le 4 de mai.  Je suis excité...très très excité.

						   C'est vrai!  J'ai commencé ma première petite histoire en français!  Et c'est pas facile.  Je dois chercher des mots presque tout le temps, mais ça en vaut la peine.  Je l'appelle  Les superbes aventures de Jules , et c'est très simple.  L'intrigue centre sur un jeune garçon qui a une grande imagination.  C'est au sujet de ses exploits dans son petit monde hors de sa vie normale.  Je suis très excité et je meurs d'envie de la finir.

						   Au sujet de quoi?--on pourrait demander.  Bien...je sais pas, mais j'ai des idées.  Une idée implique un petit garçon qui vit avec sa famille mais ce n'est pas très heureux, alors il essaie de trouver un exutoire (qui veut dire en anglais "outlet", en cas de j'oublie) pour son imagination.  Il voyage à la forêt où il trouve des arbres qui sont très mystérieux.  Étrangement ils ne l'effraient pas du tout parce que sa imagination commence à marcher.  Il croit que les arbres sont ses amis et à cause de ça il n'a aucun peur.  C'est simple--je sais déjà--mais il faut commencer avec un peu et constuire dès là.  Mon but cet été, c'est d'écrire une petite histoire, et je le ferai.  Je le ferai.

						   C'est vrai!  Enfin je vais obtenir les choses dont j'ai eu besoin pour tourjours!  C'est assez de points d'exclamation.  Je suis heureux parce que j'avais commencé de croire que je ne les obtiendrais jamais.  Mais maintenant je sais que c'est pas vrai.  Je vais obtenir des appareils dentaires!  Assez de points d'exclamations!  Mais ça n'arrive pas jusqu'à le début de juillet.  Le dimanche ma famille et moi, on va visiter mon grand-père à Austin.  C'est un malade et je sais pas comment dois-je l'aider.  Il a du cancer, et le cancer devient pire.  Alors, je vais passer du temps avec lui pour qu'on puisse prendre plaisir au temps qui reste.  Il y a de l'autres problèmes chez moi qui sont terribles.  Ils me font triste au point où je sais pas ce que je dois faire.  J'ai besoin d'un peu de foi, c'est tout.  Il faut que j'aide ma mère et mon père à surmonter tous nos problèmes.  C'est pas impossible, mais c'est difficile.  Peut-être les appareils dentaires me fasse-ils plus heureux ;-)

Curieusement cet été a été bien sans des fois quand il m'ennuyait.  Maintenant je suis d'accord avec les gens qui ont dit que l'été n'est pas toujours passionnant, par manque d'un meilleure terme.  le 9 jusqu'à le 14 je vais être près de San Antonio à campement avec les Young Marines.  Je n'étais pas très excité avant mais maintenant je peux voir comment peut-il être drôle.  On voit.

      Ahhh, Homecoming.  It's so funny, you know?  It's one of the cornerstones of the high school experience, yet I'm just now experiencing it as a junior.  Sadly, though, I don't really care, right now.  I made such a big deal about asking the girl to Homecoming (I even went so far as to write a poem, break it up into stanzas, and leave one stanza and a rose apiece in some of her classes), and I'm glad that I'm getting to go with her, but right now I have more troubling issues on my mind.  One of my closest friends, whom we'll call Rho for now, is having health problems.  Thursday is her birthday, and she's going to be out having tests taken and what not.  That sucks that it's on her birthday, you know?  Rho truly amazed me when she showed up at our regional marching band contest on Saturday in her panther suit (she's the school mascot), and it really showed me just how great a friend she is and how much she means to me.  Now, there may be something seriously wrong, and I don't know what to do about it.  Homecoming is the last thing on my mind.  My best friend's life is the first.

      Life.  It's funny, you know?  Just when you think you've got it all figured out, it comes up and totally runs you over and leaves you wondering what the heck just went on.  Somehow, though, I think I'll make it through.  As crazy as it sounds, I think that the whole key to the madness  is  the madness, no matter what anyone else says.  There are two things I'm sure about: death and that you can't be sure about anything...heh, I guess that cancels even death out.  I want this blog to be a reflection of my thoughts, feelings, and philosophies as they come to me.  They may be in English, Spanish, French, or Italian...whichever I'm in the mood for, I guess ;-)  LifeSeeker, Philip

      Okay, so I just saw  Drumline  for the first time, and...  Why can't our band do that?  I love our band to death, but sometimes I think we're too uptight, you know?  Mr. Um kind of...tries, but we're so rooted in tradition that we can't branch out into New Age stuff.  Maybe I can use my influence next year to kind of help the band along.  I know a lot of people would like to see our band become both a high-quality and high-enterainment band, so why not add some 97.5 or 104.5 to our repertoire?  I'm all for it ;-)

      You know what's the only downside to Thanksgiving?  The after-Thanksgiving depression.  Oh, yes, it's true.  After all the smiling, hugging, and kissing, and after the long car trip home, you get to thinking.  No, it's not about how thankful you are that you got to spend time with your family (not that I didn't think of that; I did that on the car trip back home), but rather that it's pretty much the weekend already which means...  School.  Really, do I have to go back?  I mean, I can miss a couple of days, weeks, or maybe even months?  How about this: you give me my diploma and I'll stop darkening your hallways.  Sound good?  Yeah, okay, so I'm a little out of it today, but I'm just not looking forward to going back to school.  Not that being home has been that great, either, but I have more freedom at home...kind of.  This has been a productive time off, but I don't want to go back to school and realize how none of it relates at all to what I'm doing at school.  This next week is going to be killer.  I have to finish my article for the  Echo  (of which I only have 2 sentences written), raise about a zillion dollars so that the  Echo  can actually go out (I learned that whenever you have an excessively large amount of money to deal with, it's best not to refer to it by its actual amount, but rather as a "zillion"; besides, it makes it sound harder), perform at a band concert our band's not ready to play at, and then on Saturday, go to All-Region Band tryouts.  Hell Week, anyone?  On a much brighter note, this year's halfway over.  When I think that I only have as much time between college and I right now as I did between the beginning of my sophomore year (which doesn't seem that long ago) and now, I get really warm and fuzzy inside.  This time next year's going to be really exciting as in a couple of weeks from now next year, I'll be receiving a letter from NYU telling me whether I made or not (at which point I would throw myself off of my room if I didn't, hehe).  Good times, eh?  Finally, I'd just like to give a tribute to sweet potato pie.  I mean, it's the best thing ever.  I ate a whole pie by myself yesterday, and could have eaten about 3 more.  My Aunt Chris's sweet potato pie is the best ever.  Perhaps I can call in on Monday and say that I'm lying in bed dying of sweet potato pie intoxication.  I'm sure that'd go over well.

      It's Thanksgiving, and I'm thrilled, I'm excited, I'm ecstatic, and--  I'm bored to tears.  I know, I know.  It's the saddest thing in the world.  Here I am with five days stretched like a vast, wide-open prairie in front of me, and I don't know what to do with myself.  This day has dragged on mercilessly, and while I was drunk with serenity after having slept for 10 hours, I suddenly found myself with nothing to do.  My mom says I should clean my room, but I say pooh-pooh to that.  Did I just say pooh-pooh?  Can you tell how this day is having a bad effect on my intelligence?  Luckily (or perhaps unluckily), tomorrow my family and I will travel with my grandmother to Crocket, TX, where we will meet the rest of our TX family (or most of it) at my great-Aunt Christine's house.  I'm glad because I haven't seen most of my non-immediate family in quite a while, but at the same time...I hate car rides!  WAAAHHH!!!  I can't say that today was a complete waste, though.  I worked diligently in my French workbook today after several weeks of neglecting my third language.  I've had Spanish crammed down my throat at school every day (even though I love it to death) and I've really been trying to pick up Italian lately, so I'd kind of pushed po' lil' ol' French to the side.  However, thanks to my friend Alec, I have my first French book to read:  Quinze Ans , which means 15 Years for all of you non-French speakers.  Wow, I'm really condescending today.  Guess I should stop.  Well, back to mind-numbing-yet-totally-brainless monotony.  Au revoir!

      Life...is...good.  It's funny I'm saying this now after weeks of gloomy-and-doom blogging, but I must say that I'm pretty happy right now.  I mean, we only have two--count, TWO--days of school this week, cold weather is settling in, which  really  makes it seem like Christmas, and I've got the greatest friends in the world.  Seriously.  Recently, I've kind of been questioning where I stand with my four best friends.  One I rarely get to see during the day because we have zero classes together, another is caught up in big theatre decisions, another I rarely get to see because I only have one class with him, and the last is one with whom I've felt pretty secure for quite a while now simply because we see each other and hang out a lot.  Now, though, I really think things are going to be okay.  This Christmas, Katie, Jenny, Alec, Emily, and I are going to go get our picture taken with Santa Claus, which will be a lot of fun.  I can't wait for that.  This spring we're going to go get professional pictures done so that we can have some good pictures to put in our senior ad that we're going to put in the yearbook next year.  I can't wait!  Besides, I went to lunch for the first time in weeks today (instead of going to the newspaper room), and everyone was really warm and welcoming.  It made me get that warmed-over-gummy-bears kind of feeling, and that was really cool.  The great thing is that everywhere I turn, I have friends.  I'm walking to newspaper, there's Alyssa, my editor-in-chief, tugging my bag and asking how I"m doing; I'm going to my locker, there's Rachel helping me out in a little financial jam; I'm feeling down, there's Patrick ready to play twosies, threesies, and even up to sixies.    And I say again, life...is...good.

      Today is the 40th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy's assasination.  You know, I didn't even know it until Friday.  In fact, I had little interest in the subject until we started talking about it in history.  There are so many unresolved issues surrounding his death that my interest was piqued.  Mrs. Istre told our class that there were several specials coming on the History Channel over things like the different conspiracy theories, the actual video of Kennedy being shot, and, as I found out later on, a 3-hour look at John F. Kennedy, the President and the man.  The latter I just finished watching, and I have to say that I am awe-inspired.  I truly think that Kennedy was one of the, if not  the , most incredible and awe-inspiring Presidents of the United States of America.  His story really is a sad one, but I'm glad that I know it now.  I think some of our latter-day Presidents could learn many a thing or two from him, but that's an entirely different rant for another time.  I can say that I am proud to be a part of this country after watching that special, and I eagerly await November 2004 where I can finally voice my opinion in the Presidential election.  How sweet that day will be for me.

      I want nothing more at this time than to leave.  College has never looked so inviting as it has this last month or so.  It's not that I don't love my family, but they're driving me out of my mind.  If I could just have my independence, maybe things would get better.  Like today.  After school, I went to work on newspaper stuff for a little over an hour.  Well, I went out to my car, and wouldn't you know it, it wouldn't start.  I could have sworn it was because of the battery, which caused me to be stranded not even a week ago.  So, I was stuck at the school, I called my mother, I complained, then I sat and did pre-cal homework.  It sucked.  Then, it finally started before my dad could travel the 30 miles home from work to give me a jump start, and I went home, yelled, and now I've shut up for the rest of the evening.  I'm just so tired of being around my parents.  Honestly, the only one I really look forward to coming home to is my little dog, who seems to be going through some health issues right now.  I really hope he doesn't die now at the time when he's my only salvation in this house.  I'm just dissatisfied with things just because I guess I'm tired of being satisfied with them.  For some reason, I seem to be second-guessing  everything .  Are my friends my true, rock solid friends?  Do my teachers really want me to succeed?  Am I really going to be able to be somebody?  So many questions, a lifetime to answer them, yet it feels like the hours of my life are dripping wastefully down the drain...

      Okay, so I made up with my mom, which is good, right?  I cannot express just how much I want to get out of this house.  I keep telling myself that I only have a little over a year-and-a-half more, and then I'm out of here.  Seriously, I just want to be on my own and away from people who want to run my life and tell me what to do.  Haha, don't I just sound like the typical teenager?  Well, good...I guess it's time for a little rebellion, after all.  I've always been a rebellious child, but it's gotten pretty intense these last couple of years.  I really just want my independence, freedom, and the space that goes with it.  I know I should call Katie, but...I don't know.  Am I a bad friend?  When I saw her in the hallway, she seemed rather distant.  It's kind of like that month at the beginning of the school year where she was mad at me and wouldn't speak to me.  A month is a long time.  Do I want that to happen again?  I know what I need to do, but...seriously, am I a bad friend?  I hope not.  I have a new respect for telemarketers.  We're on the phone constantly in newspaper and lunch trying to get people to buy ads for the  Echo , but we're still not even close to where we need to be to produce the quality of magazine that we did last year.  *sigh*  Oh well.  We're a hardy group; maybe something will come and save the day...not.  Off to more Italian, non?  I seriously love the language.  It just sucks that hardly anyone speaks it.  Maybe I can get my friends into it...not.  Whatever.  We played  Pillow Songs  for the first time today!  Ahhh!  How exciting!  We were working in a small, hot room, but we made it through.  There's a lot to work on, but I'm really glad that the people I have in my mini-band are hard-workers and are willing to put in the time and effort to make it great.  Many of them complimented me on the song, which made me feel really good.  It's funny how life can be good and suck so badly all at the same time.  Leave it to me, eh?

      She's okay.  Isn't that crazy?  I mean, she's absolutely, positively fine.  Barely a scratch.  Sure, she was shaken up a bit, but when I think about what could have happened.  Actually, the most interesting that came out of this entire experience was the colossal fight that broke out between my mother and I.  We haven't really spoken in the last three days because she chose not to let me go see Katie in the hospital that night.  I was so angry that I said a lot of things that, though harsh, I don't regret even now in all of our silence.  True, children normally shouldn't talk to their parents in the way that I did, but it had to be said.  Sometimes things just build up in you for a while, and when one little thing sets it off, it REALLY sets it off.  In other news, I'm working very diligently on my Italian, as you can see in the right sidebar.  I love it to death.  Every time I start learning a new language, I get this really excited feeling in the pit of my stomach; it's what I look forward to everyday.  I have a friend (Laura) who's learning Greek, so I may ask her to help me out with that too.  My main focuses after I solidify Spanish, French, and Italian will be learning Greek and German, then maybe Portuguese (still debating on this one), then Hebrew, then the much harder Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, and all the other "-eses."  Languages truly are my passion.  I can't wait to study them in depth when I get to college.  My other passion, music, is really coming into play this week.  Thursday, I'm trying to get together my mini-band to practice  Pillow Songs .  I can't wait to hear how it sounds in the real world as opposed to a stupid midi file.  That is, IF the players can play it ;-)  Finally, I'm coming up on a crucial decision that really shouldn't be a crucial decision at this stage in my life but is.  I'm really getting torn between two things I really want to do as careers: television journalism and high school teaching.  High school teaching?  What?!?!  Am I crazy?  I've always wanted to be a teacher, and somehow, someday, I know I will be.  However, I also love journalism for the simple fact that you get to connect people to places, ideas, and world events that they never would have known about otherwise.  When I think about the impact TV journalists have had on my life...*shivers* Yeah, it's pretty scary.  What to do?!  What to think?!?!  Who'm I gonna call?!?!  The Indecisiveness Busters!

      Waiting.  God, it's so hard to do.  I don't know what to do.  Should I call?  Waiting for the call obviously isn't helping?  I'm sure she's okay, but...what if?  I hate that question.  What if?  She'll be fine, right?  Things like that don't happen to my best friends, right?  Who can I talk to?  Alec's trying to find out where she's at, Emily doesn't know anything, Jenny has a show tonight, and Katie...WHERE IS SHE???  Car accidents can be fatal, but I'm sure it wasn't, right?  Sure, she's a reckless driver sometimes, but not bad enough to get herself seriously injured, right?  God, I hope she's okay.  Dear God, Lord, Jesus Christ, whoever's out there listening, she has to be okay.  Just because it happened to her, doesn't mean it'll happen to me...right?  I can't lose my best friends.  They're my rock, my foundation.  This is too much.  I hate it.  And still, I'm waiting.  Waiting.  Waiting.  Philip

      Well,  Pillow Songs  is nearing completion.  Finally, after what seems like many months (it's only been a couple) of long nights, endless playbacks, and endless fixings, my pride and joy is ready to be played.  I've been handing out the parts for the last week or so, and I'm glad to say that people are excited to play in my lil' Ensemble That Could ;-)  It's great to know you have friends, you know?  I mean, this year, I've made more friends through band as drum major than I ever could have imagined.  Robert and Hillary, my fellow drum majors, have been so much fun to work with, and getting to know and work with the band has been a great experience.  No wonder I'm seriously considering the music education profession, eh?  Yeah, well...we'll see ;-)  My rough draft for  The Echo  is due tomorrow, and I haven't even lined up the four interviews for my article.  Isn't that bad?  I have so much fun in that class.  There are only six full-time staff members, and it's great.  I seriously could go all day just in that class.  Mrs. B is great.  I should be reading Death of a Salesman right now, but I'm so lazy, and procrastinating is so much more fun, right?  Actually, I'm thinking about going and working in my Italian book.  Il mio italiano è malo, mai...yeah, so I have a ways to go, hehe.  Between that, French, Spanish, and even my own native love English, my tongue's been working overtime and without pay, too.  Hehe, gotta luv it.  Life is good, all is well, amen.  Philip

      NYU?  NYU!  NYU?!?!?!?!  Yeah, it's a crazy thought, me going to NYU.  But hopefully this time next year I'll be making that crazy dream a reality through EA.  I mean, sure, I may not get in, but I'm pretty much hanging all of my hopes and dreams on it.  Isn't that sad?  Here I am, 17, young, intelligent, able to go to hundreds of other places, but I want to go to NYU.  Why?  Because NYC is home.  Sometimes you can just feel it, you know?  NYC is calling me, just like it calls thousands and millions of others each year.  But I just feel like NYC is where I need to be.  Waco, TX doesn't have what I want.  TX doesn't have what I want.  I don't think anywhere else but NYC has what I need to start realizing my dreams.  It's the City That Never Sleeps, the Mecca of the West, the Jewel of the Americas.  I...LOVE...NYC!  Now all I have to do is figure out how to get there ;-)  Philip

      There goes Santa Claus, there goes Santa Claus, right down Santa Claus lane!  Well, Christmas officially ended yesterday morning with the arrival of my ultra-cool new music composition software Sibelius 3!  I spent most of yesterday trying to make it work, but these computers...gaahh, we have 3 and yet it can only semi-work on one.  Sheesh!  But it's so awesome because now I can make mp3's out of my songs and make CD's and stuff like that.  I'm really excited.  I have to finish my revamp of  Pillow Songs  in the next eight days, so...ahhh!  Yeah.  But seriously, my aunt is the best auntie in the whole entire world because she's the one who bought the program for me.  No, you don't understand.  You see, the program costs over $700!!!  I never expected her to buy it even though she had expressed an earlier interest in doing so when she shought it was around $300-$400.  I seriously didn't think I could accept it, but knowing my aunt, she won't take it back.  I love Christmas.  I have to say, though, that one (or, actually, two) of my favorite gifts of the season was a letter from one of my old buddies from a Stanford summer school I attended.  One lives in Miami and the other right outside of Seattle, and I consider it amazing that I now have friends in literally all corners of the nation (Hawaii included).  I really miss them.  This past summer at Stanford was truly the experience of a lifetime, and the best summer I've ever had in my entire life.  Absolutely incredible.  I spent Christmas Eve and Day in Egypt.  Before you go getting all excited, it was Egypt, TX ;-)  How cool is that?  That's the big stomping ground of my family and has been for almost the last two centuries.  It was nice to see my family, some of whom I haven't seen since Thanksgiving and others since about a year-and-a-half ago.  I have a whole bushel of new little cousins, about 8 of them, between the ages of four months and three-and-a-half years.  It's strange, because I used to be the youngest one in my family, and there's about a three-year gap between the cousin closest in age who's older than me and about a ten-year gap between the cousin closest in age younger than me.  Now, I'm the one being looked up to instead of being the one looking up to someone (although I still do that).  Well, I'm off to go find a costume to wear for this New Year's Eve costume party I'm going to.  I hate going to costume parties, but I like the person, so...eh, well, it's the holiday season.  I can make sacrifices :-).

      Parties are so much fun, yet so exhausting!  So I just threw my first party in over a year, and I have to say it was pretty tiring.  Patrick (Paprika), Erin (Vivica), Katie (Katarina), Emily S. (Aemalysa), Jeremy (Jeronimo!), Jenny (Rho), Emily B. (Evangeline), and Zane (Z, Zeke) all came by.  We ate some pizza and cinammon sticks, then watched  Bringing Down the House  with Steve Martin and Queen Latifah before playing some Taboo (which can get pretty crazy if you don't watch out).  It was a lot of fun, I have to say.  It's good to have friends.  Clean-up really wasn't that bad.  My dog got a hold of some chocolate, though, so he'll get pretty sick later on.  That sucks.  Tomorrow I should go out to help with traffic directing at the Baylor graduation, but I'm pooped, so I'm not sure if I'll wake up in time.  I'm not going to set my alarm ;-).  Besides, I need to get a head start on continuing reading  Quinze Ans  and  La casa en Mango Street , finishing  Pillow Songs , finishing my application to B. Dalton, finding more applications, studying Italian some more, figuring out what kind of gifts I can give out for Christmas, and more.  Yeah, I have a long weekend ahead of me, but you know what, ¡extá bien porque estamos cerca de la Navidad!  Ok, I know that was just a really bad case of Spanglish, but I don't care.  It's late.  Time to go sheepy-poo :-).

      Today was a good day.  It was also Emily Sadler's, one of my best friends, birthday, so she, our group of friends, and I went out to celebrate at Chili's.  I've never been before, so it was nice.  The only thing was that the popular clique from Midway also decided to show up, so it was rather awkward seeing so many people I know yet am not on comfortable terms with walking through the door.  Chili's was nice, though.  It's hard getting the five of us (along with auxiliary good friends Emily Bivona and Rachel Steely) together, so today was a rare treat.  Tomorrow, we're supposed to be getting our picture taken with Santa Claus.  Exciting, no?  I watched the last three chapters of  Angels in America  Sunday, and they weren't disappointing.  I understood not even half of the message being given, yet it was awe-inspiring just to watch it in all of my incomprehensibility.  Still, I, along with Jenny, am going to be the first in line whenever it comes out on DVD.  It is to me what the Jesus video is like to many die-hard, evangelistic Christians.  Absolutely incredible.  Today, I took the Pre-Cal exam, and it wasn't  too  hard, but I have to say that I did get caught up on about 3 problems, and since it was a 46-question test, I may end up with a "B", which sucks.  However, it's the only "real" final I have to take (I have to go to band and newspaper tomorrow, then take the BCIS exam Friday), so I'm glad it's out of the way.  Finally, Christmas break is here, so I can start doing the things I need and want to do, i.e. find a job, look for scholarships, read  Quinze Ans  and  La casa en Mango Street , work on the Italian, and the other million and one things I have to do.  To end with, I'd like to provide some rather humorous responses to some of the questions I graded for those going for promotion in the Young Marines (I'm the Company Gunnery Sergeant, so I get stuck grading the tests, hehe).  I love little kids.   Q: What should you do when your out camping and you get lost?  A: Stand still and scream.   Q: What does it mean when the flag's flown upside down?  A: United We Stand  Gotta luv kids, hehe.

      Wow, okay, so I just got through watching the first three chapters of  Angels in America  on HBO and...wow.  It's going to be very hard for me to do this, but I'm going to try and provide a glimpse as to what the mini-series is on the surface.  It's basically about a gay guy who has AIDS, his lover (who kind of leaves him), another guy who's been "heterosexual" all his life but finally admits he's gay (he, I believe, gets AIDS as well), his crazy wife (with great comic relief), and this other high-powered closeted gay guy who's the first to get AIDS.  It basically details their struggles, discoveries, etc., with some hilarious fantasy sequences dispersed throughout the chapters.  But on the inside, it means so much more, and has been powerful enough to raise questions about society and its perceptions and its systematics inside of me.  The movie takes place in the 1980's when AIDS mania was starting to go crazy and homophobia ran rampant among society.  There's so much symbolism and philosophy in the movie that it's nearly too much to comprehend, from society's belief in ultra-conservatism yet with ultra-liberalism coming out of the closet as well.  I can't wait until next Sunday when the last three chapters are shown, because this is quite possibly my favorite movie of all time (there have been two others, "Happiness" and another one I whose name I can't think of; both of which have been on HBO).  In a day and age of sight gags, one-liners, and plot-based movies, it's quite rare for a movie to actually make me think, but this one has.  Many of HBO's original movies and series do, so I encourage anyone who has HBO to check out their programming.  It's incredible.  A lot of it makes me look at life in a completely different way, which is awesome.  And now I have to go do homework, which is such a complete contrast to what I've done for the last 3 hours that I want to either regurgitate, cry, scream, or do something totally crazy simply because the two events simply cannot be juxtaposed.  One week more until the finale of quite possibly one of the greatest movies ever made...

      There's nothing like yelling at a bunch of little kids for nine hours straight to make your day just a little bit brighter :-)  So, today I started my fourth recruit platoon in the 7th Recruit Training Series of the Young Marines.  This year's group is quite different from the rest: most are young, scared, and rather bland.  I have no problem children like in years past.  I have no outstanding recruits like in years past.  They're just kind of...there.  Now, this could change within the next couple of weeks, but...well, right now it's not looking so bright.  On a side note, do you ever get that feeling that your life may be spinning out of control and you don't even know it?  I've been having that strange feeling today.  It's like every once in a while, a light gust of air blows away a curtain that's hanging in front of my eyes, and I see things, and they aren't pretty.  I don't know.  Maybe I'm just going a little crazy from the stress of school and stuff.  But...  It scares me.  Other than that, my day's been great, lol.  Life's crazy, and I'm learning to deal with it one step at a time.  I just know that I still have a lot of growing up to do, and when I think that I'll be leaving home within a year-and-a-half (and possibly FAR away), it's a wake-up call.  For sure.

      The beginning of the end is near...  Oh, yes, I can feel it.  But right now, it's kind of bittersweet.  I know that it's so close, yet when I think about it, it's SO far away.  Yes, that's right, I'm talking about graduation.  Today, in history, we got our registration packets for our senior year.  That was pretty despeechifying (yes, I just created a word, so shoot me), and yet so incredibly awesome!  January's almost over, then it'll be short lil' ol' February, then March (a week of which is devoted to Spring Break), then April, and finally May (which is a blow off month anyway).  Then this wretched year that is my junior year will be over.  Life will be good.  I usually don't like to post too much newsy stuff here, but I'm really psyched about getting selected as Divisional Young Marine of the Year.  I've already been named Batallion Young Marine of the Year and Regimental Young Marine of the Year (which roughly corresponds to the Regional and State YMotY in civilian terms), so the fact that I beat out people from eight other states is pretty cool to me, seeing as I usually don't win too many things.  This means that in April, I will travel to Reno, NV (yes, NEVADA!!!) to attend the Young Marines' Commander Conference where I will compete with five or so other Young Marines for the National Young Marine of the Year.  And if I get that...well, I don't even want to get that far ahead of myself, so I'll stop, hehe.  Do you know that really awesome feeling you get when you get a very pleasant reminder of your past?  That's been happening a lot lately.  During lunch, a couple of my newspaper buddies and I sat down with Mrs. B (although she was only there for a couple of minutes) and reminisced about our elementary school experiences.  How fun it was to remember the boy who kicked the poor midget kindergarten teacher in the shin nearly everyday at recess, as well as the boy who undertook the daunting task of picking off every one (yes, EVERY one) of the fingernails off of one of his hands.  If only the rest of life were as simple as kindergarten, complete with recess, nap time, snack time, playdoh, and writing-to-read labs.  *sigh*  Those were the days.

      A new year has dawned...  Yes, it is now officially 2004, and has been for the last 49 or so hours.  New Year's Eve was the best I've had in years if not ever.  I spent it with some great friends (Rachel, Jenny, Alec, Emily, and Sara Hills), and we all headed over to Chloe's (Rachel's) in our formalwear.  Do not ask me why, because I couldn't give you an answer.  However, I'm sure that Chloe and Jenny were behind it.  Hmm...It was great, though, because we went out to eat at Gratziano's, an Italian restaurant, which was nice.  The real fun started happening afterwards, when we walked over to Heritage Square singing at the top of our lungs and, gasp!, jaywalking.  Oh, it felt good to be a rebel and break the law by  jaywalking .  How cool is that?  LOL.  Well, we took a couple of pictures before heading to, of all places, H-E-B.  We wandered along the aisles aimlessly for a couple of minutes before Jenny gave the stop purpose by bying some random dress/bridal magazine, or something like that.  We headed over to Jenny's house and watched  10 Things I Hate About You , which I've never seen.  It was okay.  Jenny and others proclaimed it to be the best teen movie, they'd ever seen, but American Pie (1, 2, and the yet-to-be-seen 3) still has my heart ;-).  After finishing the movie, we headed back to Chloe's house and played Dutch Blitz--an awesome game!--for a while before counting down the New Year.  We ran outside and blew noisemakers that didn't work and fired little crackers (not FIREcrackers, but just crackers) and watched the fireworks from the distance before going inside to play my new favorite game: Mad Gab.  I seriously need to play that game again.  I was determined not to have a New Year's Resolution this year, but while I was at my grandmother's house wandering in her enormous backyard, I came up with one.  This year, I'm going to pursue what I want with everything that I am, which basically translates to: I'm not going to be a half-ass (pardon my french), like I've been in the past.  If I want to get into NYU, I've got to get off my rear and get into gear, because $40,000+ isn't just going to fall in my lap (though I really, REALLY wish it would).  So, that's what this year is dedicated to: doing what I have to in order to get what I want, which is to go to NYU.  I'm nearly certain that I have everything else except the money to back up getting into the school.  It's really scary, but this is the last full year before I go to college.  How crazy is that?  But do you know what I really say?  Bring it on.

      We got a 1!  How cool is that?   My  song, which with the ensemble kind of became  our  song, earned a 1 at Solo & Ensemble Contest.  Now, mind you, it was by no means our best performance.  Nevertheless, we did well enough to earn first-division (which is the best you can get), and I couldn't be prouder, both of the song as well as (and mostly of) the players.  They've just been the greatest people to work with: supportive, creative, willing-to-listen, and genuinely enthusiastic.  I really could not have asked for a better group to work with, even those who had to drop due to grade or time conflicts.  Way to go, guys!  But the best part is that we (as in the MHS Wind Ensemble) will be playing  Pillow Songs  for the May concert, the final of the year.  I can...not...wait!  To be able to have your music played by an ensemble is incredible, but to have it played by a full concert band is...wow...there just aren't words that can describe it.  Have I found my direction in life?  Have I found what I want to do with the rest of my life?  Well, one thing's for sure:  Life...is...good :-)

      Do I have to come back to English?  Okay, I've been writing in my other blogs for the last couple of days, but I suppose I should come back to the real world (a.k.a. the blog that's actually being read) and update you on the ultra-cool things going on in my life right now:  1.  Corrigan I know, it's strange.  Who would have thought that something I used to think was some highly-overrated spit-swatting fest could turn out to be one of the best things that could have happened in my life right now?  I mean, it was, in a word, incredible.  The fact that I got to spend nearly every day after school with my friends for a week is in itself truly awesome because usually we're all so busy.  Nevertheless, we all managed to have a great time bowling (Monday), eating dessert/watching American Idol/playing games at Rachel's (Wednesday), taking pictures at Emily B.'s house (Thursday), and lugging Taylor, who is in so many ways the Guru Sage Master King of All That Is Photography, over to Emily S.'s house to take candid shots that ended up being not so candid/watching great movies at Jenny's house (Friday).  The cool thing is that I've made a new friend (Cacen, a.k.a. Calcon/Calconian), met a new person (Pierre Morin, whom I've been hearing a lot about but have never really met, and generally had an awesome week.  However, one thing that it awakened me to is how distant my friend Alec and I have grown.  I mean, we used to be best friends, and now we hardly talk to each other.  It just seemed...I don't know, awkward, I guess.  Hmmm...guess we'll have to work on that.  2.  Snow Yes, that's right, I said the s-word.  You don't usually use such a word in Texas unless referring to it as something that those "damn Yankees" have, but we actually had SNOW on Friday and Saturday.  How cool was it to look out the window during PreCal and see a couple of flakes fluttering to the ground and have a couple of girls running to it and shouting, "Blizzard!  It's a blizzard!"  Pretty soon, snow was blowing all over the place.  Man, I love snow.  I never actually went out into it, but it  looked  cool, you know?  Plus, it kept me from having to go work boot camp on Saturday.  It was so nice not to have to wake up at 5:30 to get ready, then be on my feet for about 9-10 hours.  Mmmm...  3.  A Song for PaPa  Okay, so my mom told me on Friday that my grandfather took some tests that showed that his pancreatic cancer (which he fought this past summer) is showing signs of coming back.  This was on the way home from school.  As soon as I got home, I went straight to my dad's computer (on which I have Sibelius 3) and began working on a song that I call  A Song for PaPa , PaPa being the name that I call my grandfather, as a gift for her to take to him when she goes to visit him in Austin on Thursday.  I really think this is my best song yet, and it captures the spirit of my grandfather and his fight against this thing that he  will  overcome.  I know he will.  Somehow, someway, someday, he will.

      Yeah, today's been a very stressful day.  I'm seriously starting to get nervous about going to Reno tomorrow and competing with five other  highly qualified  individuals for a spot that only recently has become of utmost importance to me.  I've been on an emotional rollercoaster this week: at one point I'm thrilled about going, the next I want it to be over.  One minute I think I have a very good shot at being National Young Marine of the Year, the next I think I have none.  I really don't know what to expect.  I don't even know what I'm doing; I feel like I'm playing pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey.  But whatever.  Surprisingly, I'm not nervous about flying tomorrow.  Usually I start freaking out about two weeks before because I hate to fly; it's one of my biggest fears.  However, I'm not feeling the hysteria that normally accompanies a flight.  I guess it's because I'll be flying with my parents and grandmother instead of by myself like I was last summer when I flew multiple times.  Reno, NV, should be cool.  We won't get to see much of it, but that's okay with me.  Saturday's going to be what I think one of the most stressful days of my life thus far.  We have the oral board where the Young Marine Board of Directors basically grill you on whatever they want (personal info, YM knowledge, whatever they want) as well as the banquet.  The banquet is where they announce the winner, and start from sixth place and go up.  I absolutely  detest  when they announce results like that.  It makes me feel lightheaded and seasick (yes, seasick).  Grrr...  Well, we'll see how this goes.  I suppose this is the pinnacle of my career as a Young Marine.  I graduate from the program in a year, so I have to make this last one my best.  Guess we'll have to see what this next year holds.  As stressful as it can be, I can't wait.  Looking forward to the future is one of my favorite pasttimes ;-)

      This Easter, I decided to take an idea and make something out of it.  I've been neglecting the whole spiritual aspect of my life for far too long, now.  Last night, I had one of those "Ah!" moments when I was lying in bed doing my best to have a conversation with God/Allah/Him/Her/the Big Guy/Lady/Man Upstairs/Divine Spirit/whatever 1000 other names one can come up with for the Greater Conscience (wow, that sounded really Star Trek; guess I've been watching too much Deep Space Nine these last couple of days), and I came up with my post-Easter (which I haven't really officially observed for years) objectives: the three R's.  Yeah, I know, it sounds suspiciously like Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal promises, but I actually didn't realize it until after I'd made them.  Anyways, they are:  Resurrection Rejuvenation Renaissance  ...which all kind of boil down to my interpretation of the Easter holiday: resurrection of ideals/feelings, rejuvenation of fervor, and the renaissance: the "rebirth" of one's spiritual life.   I have yet to see if this will work, but I hope it will.  Maybe it'll start me on the road to the answers for which I've been searching for several years now so that I can find out what I believe and what I don't.  But on a much lighter note,  HAPPY EASTER!!!  Hope the Easter Bunny didn't scare you to the point of soiling yourself like one did to me so many years ago ;-)

      So with the knowledge of my latest SAT score, I can honestly say that I feel I'm ready to start the college admissions process.  Last testing period, I got a 1270, which I wasn't happy about (please, don't flail me; for where I want to go, I would have been laughed at for such a score), but this time I jumped up 100 points, passing the 1350 mark, and so I'm ready to make a go at it.  Next year's going to be a blast between wrapping up my GPA/test scores/AP scores to preparing for the Big Sendoff that is now only a little over a year away.  It's crazy, but oh so cool.  I spend most of my online time now at  urlLink College Confidential 's message board, which I guess is kind of sad.  But there's this aura on the boards of excitement that really is addictive.  I feel like I'm starting to get to know some of the people (even those who piss me off with there ridiculous "life or death" posts about Harvard, Yale, or whatever), and I can almost add another language to my list: the admissions lingo.  There exist such ultra-cool vocab words/acronyms as:  1) HYP(S) - Harvard-Yale-Princeton(-sometimes Stanford), usually used to signify that unattainable goal for those who are Ivy-oriented. 2) CC - Community College 3) FinAid- Financial Aid 4) ECs - extra-cirricular activities 5) NMSF/NMF - National Merit (Semi-)Finalist  And more!  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  I honestly talk to some of the parents on there more than I do to my own ('specially to my mom) about the admissions process.  Sometimes, though, I just get the feeling that my family wants me to go to UT because it's the most available and the least expensive, but that's not where I want to go.  When I mention other schools (all out of state), they just get that look on their face and say, "Well, baby, if you can do it, go for it."  Whatever.  On the subject of languages, though, I've officially started learning Portuguese.  Thanks, Laura, for the CD.  It rocks face.  Surprisingly, it's (so far) the hardest one for me to learn, despite it being incredibly similar to Spanish grammar- and vocab-wise.  Seriously, French pronunciation is nothing compared to Portuguese, although I must say that I love hearing Portuguese spoken.  It sounds kind of like a lazy American who's traveled to the border of Spain and France in an attempt to learn the languages of both countires but was just too lazy to commit to either's prounciation.  Nevertheless, I get to feel the excitement of learning something new (especially a language) again, which makes me happy.  Plus, it can take my mind off of the things that I know I should be doing (*cough*studyforYoungMarineoftheYearcompetition*cough*).  Nothing like good ol' procrastination ;-)

      Never underestimate the value of saying, "I'm sorry."  Two words (three sans contraction), and yet they mean so much.  The times I say it are few and far between, and usually when I do say it it isn't because I mean, "I'm sorry." It's usually when someone's having a bad day or when something happens to someone or something close to someone close to me.  What do I say?  "I'm sorry."  But the times when it  really  counts, when I really  should   say that I'm sorry, I'm unresponsive.  There have been way too many times that I haven't said I'm sorry for things I've said and/or done, especially to my mother.  I could write a book with all of the unsaid I'm sorry's, and maybe that would be enough to make her feel more valued and appreciated than she is now.  Two words than can, for some people, mean the difference between life and death.  How many times do I say, "Thank you"?  Again, I say it in passing to someone who congratulates me or helps me pick up my stuff when I drop it in the hallway, but hardly when I actually want to say it.  If I had my way, I'd say "Thank you" everytime I wake up and see my parents getting ready for work or when I see that my friends made it safely to school or when someone picks me up from the deepest of depressions or when I simply see people working to help me get to where I want to go.   You know, there are few things in this world that are worse than having one of your own family members tell you that they don't feel appreciated or like they matter simply because no one ever tells them.  That was a wake-up call for me.  I want to try now, I want to make a conscious effort to say "I'm sorry" for the things I'm sorry for, and "Thank you" for those for which I am thankful.  Two phrases, four words, five syllables, a million and one reasons why I should say them.

      Yeah, hmmm...so I guess I should update this.  Well, boot camp's over.  The 7th Recruit Training Series (my 4th) of the Greater Waco Young Marines has been put through.  I have to say that I'm glad.  There's a strange Father Syndrome I get from seeing the recruits whom I played a role in molding walk across the stage, thus making the transition from recruit to full-fledged Young Marine.  Plus, today was only a half-day, so I got to come home early.  To top it off, I finally have my Saturdays back (until we have drill on the 17th).  How sweet it is!  Just random stuff going on in my life: I won the Young Conductor's Contest, so I'll be conducting a march with the Waco Community Band on May 4th and I also won a $100 gift certificate to Holze's (which is actually what I need right now).  I'll be joining the esteemed (haha...right...) members of the National Honor Society on April 15th (or 14th, I'll have to look it up again); yeah, that's great...  At the end of this month is the National Young Marine of the Year competition (I have to start STUDYING!!!), and my feelings about that can be expressed in one word: AHHH!!!  We also have AP exams coming up at the beginning of May (U.S. Hist., Eng. Lang., and Government--oh, the dreaded gov't whose book I haven't looked at since last July...errrghsdfoiauwejr).  So, yeah, I have a busy month coming up.  But I love working under stress, I couldn't imagine doing anything else.  I'm also starting to change my career focus after some recent turn of events.  I love broadcast journalism and would love to do it, but I just don't think I'm the type of person whose cut out for that kind of job.  Journalists are more "DA" (Direct Action) type people.  I'm very much an "I-M" type of person (Influencing-Motivating).  Plus, I'm really sometimes at my happiest when I'm composing music, so...well, we'll see.  I'm looking into Northwestern U's music program--which is one of the best in the nation--and that could be serious possibility for my school of choice now.  However, it'll probably mean that I have to retake the SAT  again  because this last one will probably only get me into the 1300s at best.  And as a side note, I love the college admissions process.  I mean, it sucks and can be really stressful at times, but it's like a game.  We're all competiting, and you really  can't  know who's going to win.  I'm glad that I'm looking at really competitive colleges instead of going somewhere where I  know  that I'll get in; that's what makes the next year seem like the most challenging, stressful, mind-numbing, pain-inducing year yet.  But do you know what?  I wouldn't have it any other way.

      Not-so-blah Monday.  Could it be?!  Nothing much in the way of actual events happened today, except for Young Marine stuff.  It was fun getting up at 4:30 in the morning, driving out to a cemetery at 5:30, waiting for flags to be placed at veterans' graves to show up for two hours, and then going home when they never did.  Then, of course, thirty minutes later I had to go back up to the cemetery for the actual ceremony where we placed the suddenly-present flags by a select group of graves.  Good times.  Actually, our Company First Sergeant, who's the senior Young Marine in our unit, is about to wrap up her tenure in the Young Marines.  She ships off to Big Marines in August, so that's kind of sad.  We've been partners for the last four years or so.  It's been real.  I can't wait to go out to California.  I'm supposed to call USC tomorrow--actually, I WAS supposed to call them today--about when their "Meet USC" summer program is, and I'll be sure to do it tomorrow.  I've got to get out of Waco for a little while because it just seems to suck all the life out of me (especially when school's out).  Going out to LA will be a pleasant change from the monotony of the past year.  On a happier note, I found out that I could very well have an incredible internship next year in the MISD public relations department.  According to Mrs. B (newspaper adviser), the lady who is head of the department asked if I would be willing to intern her (i.e. write press releases, cover events, etc.) next year.  I'm still trying to work out my schedule for next year, but I would love to have the opportunity to do that.  That, added on with a possible PR internship at the Dr. Pepper Museum this summer, could put me well on my way to a career in PR.  Yeah, I'm stoked.  You know it.  GOAL UPDATE!  GOAL UPDATE!  I'm writing a song that basically has to be completed by Sunday morning for my mother's birthday since I'll be at LIFE on the Big Day (yeah, it's sad.  I know.).  It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.  Last year's just seemed to come out of my fingertips, but this year's is a bit more challening.  Ah, well.  Nothing like a good ol' musical challenge to get the blood a-flowing!  I've also started my first short story in French.  It's actually a lot of fun: it expands my vocabulary while providing practical application for the grammatical aspects of the language that I have learned.  I call it  Les superbes aventures de Jules , which translates to "Jules's Magnificent Adventures."  Yeah, it's pretty straightforward, but hey, I can't start out writing like Voltaire, now can I?  Hehe, if only I could.  Tomorrow it's off to Chili's for a hopeful job interview as well as calling the lady from the MISD PR department.  Mmm, I like the taste of summer.

      All right, so *singing* it's starting to feel a  lot  like Christmas...er, I mean summertime.  I knew that it wouldn't until after I did the thing at the VA Hospital with the Young Marines, and it won't really start feeling like it until Monday afternoon after we do a flag-placing ceremony at a local cemetery.  Even though I'll still have to get up at about 4:30 in the morning to do that, I don't care.  After that, summer will have officially begun.  I'm excited about being busy.  Music camp and band yesterday was fun, if nothing else than for the sheer fact that Mr. Um now refers to my class as seniors.  Too cool for words.  As far as how we sound, well...we're not as bad as I thought we would be, but we have a lot to make up for in the maturity department.  Nothing like a stampede of freshmen whenever the pizza man delivers to the band hall.  Come on, folks.  Get a grip.  The not-as-fun-part-but-still-kind-of-fun part was cleaning up afterwards.  Yeah, walking around picking up stuff that you can't even rightfully identify isn't too cool, but it was just a small group of us, so it worked out.  I think I'm actually going to enjoy being drum major this year.  It's not that I didn't last year, but I feel that I'll enjoy it more now that I'll be able to take on more responsibility.  Yeah.  We also went to graduation last night, and for the most part I thought it was horrible.  I got incredibly sick of the endless screaming and noisemakers (despite The Administration's announcement not to have either since it was supposed to be a "formal" event) as well as of playing  Pomp and Circumstance  for three or four times through.  In fact, I got tired of playing altogether.  No wonder I didn't check out a horn to take home this summer.  There  was  one part of the ceremony that I did enjoy, and that was the song that the choir sang.  I always love to listen to our school's select choirs (especially the older ones) sing because they really are incredible.  The song they sang was pretty, but not quite as sad as I had hoped for.  Nevertheless, it was quite enjoyable, as was seeing several of my friends (it was only at graduation that I realized how few I actually have in the Class of 2004) walk across the stage.  Good luck, guys.  I know you'll all be the future Bill Gates, Oprah Winfreys, Arnold Schwarzaneggers, and Monica Lewinskys of our great country.  Just don't forget your friends back home who still have a year left to endure!

      All right, so my first official thing to do as a senior (besides drive home) was to go over my friend Jeremy's house and watch he and several other friends play Halo.  Now, I've watched people play Halo for the last couple of years now, and let me tell you that I feel like I should know the game.  Nevertheless, I took my time by stealthily observing the moves, behaviors, and strategies of my dear, Halo-obsessed comrades.  Just so as to give you a minor glimpse into just  how  into the game these people are, I rang Jeremy's doorbell, waited about 20 seconds, and then knocked.  I got a rather faint, "Come in," so I walk in.  No sooner to I step foot inside than I hear good ol' Chip (and you have to know Chip to be able to understand what comes after) who's screaming at the top of his lungs "MY ONLY PURPOSE IN LIFE IS TO KILL YOU ALL!!! DIE!!! DIE, YOU ALL!!!"  Man, and I thought t-ball moms and dads were intense!  So after a while, at Jeremy's suggestion/urging/command, I picked up a controller and joined in the game.  I knocked off one guy during the first game (and one game can seriously last forever), but spent most of the time trying to figure out how to move left, right, up, and down and look in those same directions.  I was completely lost.  Nevertheless, while I was just randomly testing my weapon, I happened to hit one of the enemy.  Score!  Second game, I wasn't so lucky.  In fact, I got shot and killed so many times that I should've looked like a bad blend of swiss cheese and ketchup (thank goodness for Instant Rejuvination!).  Yeah, I decided during the endless, embarassing game that it was time to go ;-)  Well, I'm off to go enjoy my first movie as a SENIOR with all my cool SENIOR friends.  Um...yeah, I can already tell I'm going to annoy the crap out of my own self.  '05 Fo Shive...er...okay, maybe not.

      So I got my official letter from Baylor LIFE today "strongly urging" me to send in my registration materials for the program.  Ha!  Already done, psycho stalkers.  Already done.  Actually, I'm getting more and more excited about this every day.  I found out I'm going to be staying at Penland, which, if it's anything like its food, is an awesome dorm.  I was worried I'd end up staying in one of the crappy dorms, but it all ended up working out.  I thought it was funny when my mom asked if I was going to register to take my car to the program.  Silly mother!  You know that prolonged exposure to heat (since I would drive it there and then be forbidden to for the next four days) makes my car a very irritable monster.  She must've had temporary amnesia.  Ah, and so the time has come to set goals for the summer.  I always love doing this because strangely it's usually these goals that I actually accomplish (unlike frivolous things like New Year's resolutions and I'm-turning-a-year-older-so-I-need-to-change-things resolutions).  Like last year: I said I wanted to: 1) go to MOWW and at least try to be social (check!), 2) go to Stanford and have the time of my life (check!), 3) break out of my shell and be more outgoing (check!), 4) go to band camp and have fun getting to know everyone (check!), 5) work on French (check!) and start learning a new language (Italian; check!).  All right!  Well, this summer's no different.  Here you are, ladies and gentlemen.     Philip's Top 10 for Summer 2004 : 1) Get a job  2) Go to LIFE, make some new friends, and learn something 3) Find a couple of places to volunteer 4) Step up as Division 4/Regimental/Batallion/Unit Young Marine of the Year 5) Go to band camp and do more as a student leader 6) Learn a new language (Portuguese) and work on the others 7) Read at least five (whew!) books that I want to read, and then buy books off the AP Spanish and AP French Literature lists 8) Take up writing again (i.e. short stories, poetry, novelettes, and episodic dramas--you know what that means ;-)) 9) Complete at least two new musical compositions 10) Produce CDs of a couple of my songs to send off to my friends from JSA  I'm sure I'll think of more later, but for now, these will do.  Will it happen?  Yes.  I just have to remember two things:  ENGAGE!  And make it so.  (I heart  Star Trek: TNG )

      Well, before I get into that, yes, today was my first day of finals.  I only had one (Spanish), and I finished in no time.  Yeah, it was pretty easy.  After helping Sra. C move her stuff into her new room for next year, I informed her that I wouldn't be in her class next year.  I used a schedule conflict as my excuse, and honestly that is one of the main reasons I'm not taking the class next year.  I just conveniently left out the part about really not liking that class this year; I have to be tactful, after all :-)  Tomorrow is newspaper and history, both of which are basically non-finals.  I also have to ask Mr. M for a chemistry book to study this summer so that I don't suffocate in elements and equations next year in AP Chemistry (seeing as I haven't even taken chemistry at all).  Fun stuff.  Okay, so I'll try to make this short and sweet.  I've found in the last two weeks that it is becoming increasingly difficult to ask my parents for things.  In fact, it seems to be nearly impossible for me to ask my dad for something as simple as money, a bit of which I happen to need right now.  Maybe it's to punish him...or myself...or both of us.  I don't know.  My relationship with my dad is complex enough to write a book about.  The effects of it can be seen from everything as simple as my name to my ever-present trust issues.  I'm way too exhausted to try and go into details about why this is even important to me right now, but as I come into the last full summer before I go away to college (I don't count next year because who knows when I'll be leaving), I'm realizing that this is the last year for me and perhaps even most of my family to be close to each other.  I read a story about a woman who just had her fifteenth child, and how she still wants more.  As crazy as it is, you've gotta marvel at the love that's gotta be flowing through that family.  Insane?  Maybe.  But if you've got love, it doesn't matter.  Yeah, so I'm going to stop before this turns into some cheesy R&B love ballad.  In other news: Baylor LIFE stuff is sent in!  A week from now I'll be learning about free enterprise, hehe.  Damn military conscription!  Although it's only a remote possibility, we've got to smush even the thought of it.  Sra. H (another Spanish teacher) is definitely genial (it's foreign, don't worry).  I think she'll be able to help me out a lot in self-studying for the AP Spanish Lang & Lit tests since she taught AP Spanish before coming to Midway.  GO TROJANS!

      Today was basically the last day of school.  Thank God.  After nearly ten months of what has felt like being in labor (although in reality I have no idea nor will I ever have any idea of how this feels), school is out.  Rock on.  People were getting mushy, of course, but...well...I don't know.  It was kind of cool to see the seniors walking around with disposables and video cameras doing their best to preserve every last memory they could squeeze out of our high school, which is fine by me.  In fact, I think I'll bring a video camera to school on the last day of school next year, too.  It's a novel idea, if you ask me.  "A Day in the Life."  Sweet.  Really, though, I only had two official last days of classes today: BCIS (couldn't tell Mrs. B--no, not newspaper's Mrs. B--goodbye because she was still trying to look at someone's end-of-the-year slideshow) and PreCal (in which I took a stupid replacement test on the last day; nevertheless, it was Mrs. P's last day, so it was really bittersweet.  She's been an awesome, hilarious teacher).  I have to go to Spanish and take the final exam tomorrow (and then I'll be through with Spanish at MHS forever!  Woohoo!  Guess I should tell Mrs. C that I'm not planning on taking her class next year.  Hmm...), newspaper is on Wednesday (although we have no final; just planning for next year), and then AP English is on Thursday (I really probably should study for this one, but...well...*whines* I don't wanna!).  The only thing left to do is to get a job.  I have several applications that are sitting completely filled out on my desk in my room, but I have yet to turn them in.  What's holding me back?  Stay tuned to find out!  Same bat time.  Same bat place.

      So tonight was the journalism awards dinner, and it was fun.  Sure, it got frustrating after a while waiting for food, but hey, I've had to wait longer before.  I'm really going to miss the two people we're losing from the staff for next year.  Our editor-in-chief has been amazing: she's a golden-hearted person who's been a source of unlimited support this year; she will be missed by all, I'm sure.  The other, our sports editor, has been awesome to hang out with.  She's really fun, a bit naive at times, but cool.  It's been fun joking around with her, and although there was a couple-week spell where things were a little tense, everything worked out.  I'm really not sure what to expect about newspaper next year.  There are a couple of people I'm not looking forward to coming on staff, but others that I'm truly psyched about joining.  On top of all that, Mrs. B, our adviser, will be off having a baby when we're trying to put together our first issue (I mean, come on; having a baby, which millions of woman around the globe do every day, or getting out the first issue of the  Panther Post .  Jeez.), so it'll be hard with a sub for the first month or so.  I'm sure we'll pull it together, though.  Hopefully.  Maybe.  Oh crap.  Speaking of missing people, though, it's going to be strange going through this summer.  I mean, most of my friends and I rarely hang out over the summer because our schedules usually conflict; nevertheless, we always find time near the end to get back together and enjoy good times stress-free.  I always miss hanging out with them because, in essence, I'm alone for most of the summer.  True, I have many activities in which I'm involved (i.e. last summer's MOWW conference and the Stanford Experience), but I rarely get to spend time with people I'd actually like to hang around.  Wow, that sounded a lot worse than I wanted it to, but it's kind of true.  I love getting to meet people at all of the new, fun summer adventures, but it's never like hanging out with your best friends.  However, this summer will be markedly special because my family will be having our second family reunion (we have them every other year).  I love getting to see everyone, especially since we're so spread out over the country.  The only bad side is that due to band camp on weekdays, I'll only have a weekend to spend with my family.  Suck.  Speaking of band (man, I'm rocking on segways tonight), yes, I did manage to sneak on in into a drum major spot (haha, sort of an inside thing if you know why), and joining me will be a good friend of mine Anna D.  It's going to be strange with only two next year because this year we had three, and...well...change is WRONG, man!  It's WRONG!!!  Er...actually, no.  I'm quite excited about next year because we're going to be underclassman-heavy, which means I'll be able to exert that I'm-so-superior-to-you-simply-because-I-was-born-a-year-or-two-or-three-earlier-than-you attitude.  People with that attitude have always bothered me.  The last week is upon us.  Bring it on!  Again!

      Yes, the Last Weekend Before I'm Officially a Senior.  How sweet it is...  The field trip yesterday was almost interesting...except for the insane allergy attack that I had starting the moment we left the city and that went on until we stepped back inside the school building.  Yeah, that was definitely not fun.  However, I love being in nature, however cruel she may be to me.  There's nothing like feeling a cool breeze caressing your cheeks as you walk through a field of wildflowers while listening to a family of birds chirruping happily to one another.  Being outdoors always brings back so many happy memories of my childhood.  How I wish that I spent more time in the country!  Perhaps that's why I love going to my grandmother's house and my family's ranch down in south Texas.  Life is always so simple yet so refreshing when you get outside of the chaos of the city.  I laugh at myself as I say that because I could never see myself living in the country.  It was crazy: as we drove through the miles and miles of countryside, I saw houses that could have been two or three miles apart if not more.  I could not imagine living in that much seclusion.  I need the city around me, I need to feel the pulse of human life, and I need to feel a part of something.  Nevertheless, I would love to have a country cottage (not a house, not a mansion, maybe a cabin, but for sure a cottage) to go to during the summers.  I'll put that down on my checklist for things to get if I ever have enough money :-)  I'm really excited right now because after a great conversation with my mother about college and where I want to go, I'm going to get to go to Los Angeles this summer to visit the  urlLink University of Southern California .  After almost two months of intense research and dreaming, it's a relief and a pleasure to know that I'll get to visit the school before applying.  Coupled with the Honors Colloquium at  urlLink UT , I'll have my top two schools covered before the beginning of school next year.  More exciting and even stranger still was the conversation I had with a couple of my friends about how this time next year we'll all know where we're going to college, and some of us what we want to go into as a career.  Now, while I've had a  urlLink strong idea  for quite a while, that could always change within the next year or even the next five years.  Who knows?  It's just exciting to think about it.  At the same time, it's a little depressing to think that I'll be leaving behind several incredible friends.  There's a difference between leaving a friend behind and leaving behind someone with whom you have shared so many experiences--good and bad--over the past six or so years.  Graduation is bittersweet, but I guess that's how it's supposed to be.  But hey, we still have another year left; and oh, what a year it will be!  Between band (hopefully being a drum major again), newspaper (we'll see where I stand here in a couple of months), National Honor Society, theater (I've decided to take it up again), taking four AP classes in school, and self-studying for at least four others, it'll be a busy yet fun-filled year.  Life is good.

      Yes, that's right.  I said "hella."  In preparation for my summer trek to California, of course ;-)  So today was one of the best days I've had in a long time.  It's the end of the school year, none of us care about school anymore (okay, I know I'm generalizing, but give me some poetic license here, people), and we're all ready to have fun.  Today was the day newspaper class (yes, all six of us plus Tony the Phantom Writer) threw our teacher Mrs. B a baby shower.  There are several reasons why this was oh-so-cool.  1.  Mrs. B is my favorite teacher.  She's also pregnant, which means I get to say "Aww, she's so pregnant!" 2.  Newspaper is my favorite class. 3.  Food is good.  Food is  very  good.  Food is goodísimo. 4.  It's fun watching  urlLink Taylor  try (mind you,  try ) to lie.  He's getting better, but he's got a ways to go.  But when your subject is Queen Mal, you go from AP to Regular Lying.  Hehe, just joshin', man...and woman.  It's all in staff love. 5.  We saw Tony the Phantom Writer after a prolonged absence.  That's right, Tony.  Show up for the good times, man, and leave us high and dry when the goin' gets tough.  But hey, isn't that just the way life works? ETA: 6.  There's nothing like taking a you-think-it's-timed-but-it-turns-out-someone-didn't-press-the-timer-button-on-the-camera kind of picture.  Good times, my friends.  Good times.  The rest of the day was seriously nothing.  Of course, there was my Spanish teacher informing me that I had loads of make-up work to do (thanks, Sra. C).  Yes, I'm glad I'm not taking the class next year.  How sweet it will be!  Let me back track: I didn't do absolutely nothing (yes, a permissible double negative) today.  There was of course AP English in which Mrs. A and the senior AP teacher Mrs. M are still trying valiantly to work us into poetic analyses and vocab tests.  Come on, ladies; give us a break.  Everyone else realizes that school is practically over, so for all of your infinite wisdom, it's makin' you look kinda shady.  We're now showing our PowerPoint presentations in BCIS, and...um...hehe, this should be interesting.  My music's screwed up, and my slide show may not be long enough.  But am I complaining?  No, ma'am, because to complain would imply that I care, and quite frankly, my dear, I do not.  Poor Jenny, though; her whole presentation got screwed over.  All the changes she's made in the past week have been wiped out, so her presentation is down to a messy collection of cluttered pictures.  It's okay, Rho; the Super Friends will bail you out of this one.  Okay, enough with that.  Tomorrow is the AP US History field trip.  No, we're not going to the Empire State Building.  No, we're not going to Gettysburg.  No, we're not even going to the Texas Rangers Museum.  We're going to an old cemetery plot and a one-room schoolhouse!  Who needs US history when you can get good ol' Coryell County (which we don't even live in) history?  Hey, it's a day off from school (a Friday no less) and free food.  I simply cannot turn those two things down.  Well, I'm off to do homework.  Oh, wait, no I'm not.  Because I have none!  MWAHAHAHA!  Side note: No, I'm not high.  Just really excited that this crazy school year is almost over.  Intensely, magnificently excited.

      To start off, no, I'm not depressed.  Not really, anyways.  In fact, I feel really empty inside right now.  I'm kind of numb, but it hurts...a lot.  It's not about me; I got over that a couple of days ago.  It's about where I am, who I live with, and people I love who just can't seem to get along.  I'm not going to air my family's dirty laundry here for the whole world to see, but I'd just like to make a solemn vow and promise that I will keep until I die (maybe longer):  1.  I will never, EVER degrade someone in front of them (and if I can help it, in front of anyone else).  There is nothing worse than seeing a person who has been beaten down by another person's harsh, hateful words.  True, that person may be angry, but there is never an excuse for reducing someone to dirt level simply because you're angry.  2.  I will do my best to keep myself out of financial trouble.  My goal is to get a job now so that I can provide for myself, and to get into a good, stable career following college graduation.  Some of the things I see happening to those around me is shocking and scary.  I don't want to see that happen to me.  3.  I will treat my future wife (providing I find her) and mother of my children with the utmost respect.  I couldn't ever imagine doing anything less, yet to some people that seems to be okay.  4.  I will always do my best to be involved in my child's/children's life/lives.  I will not sit on the sidelines and watch them grow up before me and not do a damn thing to shape their moral/psychological being.  5.  I promise to not let myself lose so much self-esteem/self-respect that I can't stand up for myself.  I will not let someone talk me down without a fight; I'm better than that.  Additionally, I must have enough self-respect as to not allow myself to act in a manner that is not in-line with the person I consider myself to be.  Never sacrifice self for situation.  Ever.  ETA: 6.  I also promise never to hide between a stupid wristband to show someone how I feel about them.  HA!  Take that, Mr. M!  I'm wearing a wristband that expresses my intense hatred of you!  Bet you feel like crap now, don't you Mr. M?  Bet I've just ruined your self-image and self-esteem now, eh, Mr. M?  HA!  TAKE THAT!  Yeah, see how stupid that sounds?  If you have something to say, say it.  Otherwise, shut up and grow up.  If you don't like Mr. M, say it to his face.  If I got the chance, I'm sure I wouldn't mind doing so myself.  I just needed to get that out of my system.  I want nothing more right now than to get out of this hellhole, but I'm stuck.  To stay here another year is going to test me more than I previously thought, but I have to make it.  It's hard walking into the same emotional baggage day in and day out, knowing every day that you're going to come home to the same old thing.  For all of its splendor, there are times that life can really suck sometimes.  But hey, it's those times that make us grow, right?  If not, I'll just keep telling myself that just to make it.

      I sit here with nothing better to do as I compete against the hundreds and possibly thousands of other National Merit scholars who're just now realizing that their info is due today as they try desperately to get onto the website to submit their information.  Crappy servers.  They suck.  I don't know, today's just been a really blah day.  In fact, the only period I can say I was really happy in was newspaper, but I'm always happy in there.  Every other period and part of the day was the pits.  Sometimes I just get these bouts of semi-depression for no reason, so I just chalk it up to hormones.  I can't wait to put these teenage years and emotions behind me, hehe; after all, it's only a matter of a couple of years now.  It's crazy sometimes to think that in a little over two years from now, I will have hit my twenties (Big Guy willing), but that in itself is exciting.  To have lived for two full decades!  Haha, compared to those lived by my parents and grandparents, I've still got a ways to go and live.  Wait, what am I saying?  I have many stupid projects due this week: memory work due in English tomorrow (guess I should whip out the book to find out what I'm even supposed to be reading), an extra credit project in English due Wednesday, a major BCIS project due Wednesday, and a history extra credit project due Thursday.  Throw on top of that making up two quizzes in Spanish from last week, a math quiz, and taking two math tests by Thursday, and you begin to see just how much this week sucks.  Wow, and I thought the end of the year was supposed to be a happy, stress-free time of year.  So much for that.  P.S.  I'm just glad prom's over.  I don't think I could've taken it much longer.  I didn't go, and to some degree I'm glad, but...I don't know, there's just a lot of bad feelings associated with that right now.  Where'd that come from?

      Alas, I have broken my record blogging streak.  Oh well.  Nothing of great importance has happened over the last couple of days, anyways.  Well, except for drum major tryouts.  That was fun...sort of.  I don't know, I guess I just didn't take it as seriously this year as last.  I have a good feeling I'll make it again, but you never know, I suppose.  The only thing that's really elicited an emotional response from me was the drunk driving presentation on Friday.  Now, it wasn't so much the presentation itself as it was the jackasses (pardon my Danish) who were sitting behind me, commenting on how people who died in drunk driving accidents were "suckers" and who would cheer whenever beer bottles popped up on the screen.  I nearly lost it when they started calling one of the girls who had this amazing talent for art and who had been touched by a drunk driving loss a "fat bitch" and how "she should've died in a drunk driving accident."  Just goes to show you the quality of some of Midway's wonderful student body.  It was great today: I went to "drill" (it was actually helping out with the Vietnam Memorial Ceremony downtown) with the Young Marines today only to find out that one of the adult staff members could be facing charges of embezzelment, people are trying to break out of our unit to form another (which, in a small town like Waco, is next to impossible), and that we no longer have a place to drill at since the Marine Reserve Center has banned the Young Marines from their facilities.  Wow, a lot happened while I was gone.  I'm almost to the point where I don't care about any of the crap that goes on and has been going on for the last year or so with the adults anymore.  If I can just keep focused on the kids in the program, maybe we can get this garbage straightened out.  I'm having fun reading through all of the piano books I purchased last weekend.  Songs in my new repertoire include "The Prayer," a book called "Evening Reflections" (awesome book), "Come What May" (yes, from  Moulin Rouge ), an Alicia Keys book that I bought but quickly realized was a super-kiddie version of her amazing songs, Enya's "A Day Without Rain" (a book of the songs of that CD), and "Songs of the '90s" (it's been fun reminiscing, hehe).  Music is truly the outlet of the soul.  It's been fun writing and playing the last couple of days.  Just one more full week before finals, and then it's summertime!  All right!  I got my packet for the Leadership In Free Enterprise program at Baylor at the end of last week.  I actually think this program could turn out to be really cool; business leadership is really appealing to me.  We'll see how it works out, even if it is Baylor ;-)

      And so I let out a deep sigh of relief.  Yes, it feels as if I haven't exhaled in the last month-and-a-half.  It's funny because I look back and see that I actually anticipated all this madness.  Actually, it wasn't that bad; demanding, yes, but bad?  Not by any means.  This last month-and-a-half has been one of the most challenging yet rewarding to date.  I've even experienced a little personal growth, which is always welcome.  For those wondering about the AP Gov't exam, I guess in reality it wasn't too bad.  I really should have worked harder in my studying.  What I knew, I knew, and what I didn't...boy, I sure didn't.  I totally blew one of the free-response essays because I mixed up one of the President's formal powers with his informal ones.  ARRRGH!!!  Oh well.  In honestly, I'm so glad that it's over that I almost don't care.  At least I'll tell myself that until AP scores are about to role in at the beginning of July.  Props to Mrs. W's AP Gov't class for making me feel welcome.  Being in a room fool of seniors can be rather intimidating, but they were all cool (or chill, in hip terminology).  All is well.  Well, I'm off to do nothing for the rest of the evening.  It's great: I missed most of the day today and tomorrow I have a field trip with newspaper and yearbook to go to, so I've pretty much had a stress-free week (excepting the AP test, of course).  Seven days and counting...

      Yay!  Comments are back.  I spent approximately two hours at Barnes & Noble today studying for the AP Gov't test with two students who were actually in the class this year.  It was...um...er...eye-opening?  No, I think I'll do okay, but not stellar (wow, I hate that word).  I'm glad that I at least buckled down and studied for  one  night, but I should have done more.  Oh well.  It's the end of my Junior year and senioritis is already starting to settle in, but do I care?  Way, way, way deep down inside, probably, but me being the superficial person (;-) that I am, I'll just say that I don't.  Wow, 20-page papers in newspaper aren't fun.  Waiting in the library for pages to print out while an impatient librarian paces around the library waiting for you to leave is even less.  I'm glad we got the Colossus completed, but we're really going to have to work on getting the admin., to get off their rears and get us a new computer.  Isn't that within the awesome range of Captain SterLo's powers?  I think so, my friend.  I think so.

      Mmm...jazz...  As I sit here listening to a CD of some wonderful OSJ (pronounced ahz-jay, stands for old-school jazz; mad props to  urlLink Taylor  for the lend), I'm compelled to be philosophical.  However, I'm lacking the mental strength to do that right now, so I'll settle for random musings.  Ahhh, complacency: the fruit of life.  I'm not hating, but I am strongly disliking our school administration right now.  Long story short, that great JSA Stanford experience I've been raving about since last summer basically counts for nothing at school.  They refuse to recognize it as a program worthy of allowing me to receive credit at school.  But do I let that stop me?  No, sir, Captain PG-17's here and ready for action!  I'm writing a letter to Dr. Albers, getting my Stanford gov't professor to write a letter, and getting together all my schoolwork from back then to prove to them that Stanford is AT LEAST on par with MCC correspondence standards (please, oh please, note the sarcasm).  I hate Pre-Cal.  I wish it would die...well, if it were living.  It's not that I  totally  suck at it, but my work ethic sucks so I'm often up late doing homework and rarely study for quizzes or tests.  I need to get my butt in gear and start trying to bring my grade up.  Band officer tryouts are tomorrow.  I guess I should be more excited than I am, but...I don't know, I just can't get myself pumped up about it.  Drum major auditions are Friday, and, likewise, I'm not too jumping-for-joy about that either.  Man, I need a protein shake.  Just a couple of weeks left, Philly-boy.  Just a couple of weeks.

      "The more things change, the more they stay the same."  Whoever said that was on crack.  The more things change, the more freakishly messed up, warped, and morphed beyond recognition they seem.  Case in point: I went to Gatesville with my parents today to attend church and visit with my grandmother for Mother's Day.  I never could shake this feeling of being out of place.  Mind you, I love Gatesville and I have many friends, young and old, out there; nevertheless, I felt so alien.  Was it the way they were looking at me?  Perhaps it is my own person that has "morphed beyond recognition"?  It wasn't one of those oh-my-God-I'm-an-anemone-in-a-sea-of-clownfish kinds of feelings, but rather just like a little gnat that persisted in slightly irritating me for the whole day.  However, I had a great time today.  Mother's Day is either one of the best days or the worst days of the year for me.  Luckily, it was one of the best this go-round.  I woke up and presented my mother with a quarter-bouquet of flowers and a card and got some things (all good) off my chest about our relationship.  It was pretty neat.  I often dwell on the negative too much here at home, so it was good to step back, take a deep breath, and start to look at the bright side of things at home.  Not everything is bad.  Well, everything except that I'm not going to be going to prom after all.  How's that for a clincher!  Actually, I found out yesterday, so it didn't mar today too much.  Due to a series of events, miscommunications, and mistakes on my part, I shan't be going to prom this year.  To tell the truth, I'm kind of relieved.  I've felt really uncomfortable with this whole prom thing this year.  I don't know if I ever really got into the whole "going" thing: I didn't ask anyone, I hadn't yet made plans to get a tux, and I really had no clue as to what our prom group was going to be doing.  Maybe it's best that it worked out this way.  I'm quite excited that we only have two real weeks of school left, and then finals week.  I'm ready to get into summer: there's a lot to do and a lot to plan.  When I spoke to my Division Commander (more Young Marine talk here), he old me that I'll probably be traveling with him to encampments in Louisiana, Kansas, and Colorado.  That's pretty cool seeing as I have been to neither three of those states.  Plus, I've gotta get a job.  Dear God, I  have  to get a job.  And pronto!  P.S.  I'm likin' the new blogger layout.  It seems so...primary school, and I just LOOOOOOVE primary school!

      Hmmm...this really feels like a three-day weekend.  Maybe it was because of AP testing on Friday?  Who knows, and who cares?  This weekend has rocked.  Today I did a whole lot of nothing except take my car to get new back tires at Wal-Mart and pick up Mother's Day gifts.  Tomorrow I'm headin' off to Gatesville with my parents to attend church with my grandmother and then probably go out to eat with her (treat of my Dad's probably; thanks for volunteering, Pops ;-)).  This was sprung on me today, but I really don't mind.  I'll probably see some people that I haven't seen in years, which is always fun...kind of.  I don't know.  Sometimes I get a little apprehensive about revisiting people I used to be best friends with.  We'll see how that goes.  Hey!  I actually studied a bit today for my AP Gov't exam.  I love reading really bad AP essays.  They make me feel better about the fact that even if I do horribly on the exam, I couldn't quite do as bad as they did.  I know that sounds horribly rude, crude, and socially unacceptable, but that's exactly what I thought when I read this one essay in response to the question of "What factors increase and decrease a president's approval ratings?".  It said, and I quote:  "Decreases in presidental approval ratings is bad.  This can have a negative effect on their affectiveness and suvearly hurt their chances for re-election.  One cause for a decrease in approval ratings could be due to to much activity in a short period of time.  Change is hard to deal with."  Yeah, I quoted that exactly as it was written, grammar and orthographical mistakes glaringly included.  Needless to say it got a 1 (worst grade you can get except for a 0 or more humiliatingly, a dash).  I felt kind of bad, but then asked myself what the flying croiky this person was doing in an AP Government class in the first place.  My favorite phrase out of the whole essay, though, was "On the opposite side of the coin, if a President is felt to not be doing enough, this can also hurt them."  I'm so going to start saying "on the opposite side of the coin."  All right, all right.  Enough people-bashing for the day.  I must go cleanse my fingers out with antibacterial soap.  Hasta luego, mis amigos.

      I'm really thinking that I'm going to change AP from Advanced Placement to AccuPuncture.  Seriously, what they need to train AP students to do is not to memorize all the material on the test.  No, sir, that's the easy part.  We should have had extensive yoga and meditation sessions beginning this semester so that we could have prepared ourselves to endure the grueling mental activity that the test takes.  I really don't think my cerebral neurons have experienced that much activity in a long time.  Now, I'm always happy to give that big muscle in my head a workout, but do you know how sometimes when you haven't worked out a muscle for a while, it gets tired and/or cramps?  Yeah, that's kind of what today felt like.  So after taking the AP U.S. History test, I went back to school and, after a brief meeting with the principal and school vendors, rushed to my teacher's room where there was nothing but card games going on and food and drinks being passed around.  Mrs. I said the class is pretty much over (hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!  and all that other good stuff), which is great.  And as a bonus, we got to watch part of  To Kill a Mockingbird  in English.  Yeah, I'd already determined that I wasn't going to do an ounce of work in that class today, so it was good Mrs. A made it easier on all of us, hehe.  And for those of you who are wondering, yes, I did watch Friends last night, and well...I'll drag myself to admit that the final episode was okay (don't you dare ask me to do any better than that), but I don't think I've missed much in the last 10 years.  I'll take the 10 years of the TV Guide Channel over Friends anyday ;-)  It's the weekend!  I have no responsibilities to take care of: no drill with the Young Marines, no one to meet, absolutely, positively  nothing !  Well, except for read 700-something pages of my government book.  Yeah, I still have one more AP test to go.  Blech...

      All right, people.  I mean, come on.  Really.   What  is the deal with  Friends .  Oooh, look at me, I can walk around making jokes that sometimes even canned laughter doesn't respond to.  I can make sexual comments that make no sense whatsoever in the conversation just because it might be funny, but it's not.  Oooh, look at me, I can be outrageously stupid so that America will fall in love with me.  I mean, really.  Come on, America.  Okay, so I don't really hate  Friends that  much, but at times I wonder where our great country's headed when people follow a show like that around religiously...or more like "cultishly."  No, I'm not saying that people who watch that show are stupid.  I'm sure they're great American blue bloods.  However, their taste in television leaves something to be desired.  Case in point: one of my best friends is a Friends fanatic.  Every morning in BCIS she tells me about how devastated she is that Friends is ending (because of course, I, self-proclaimed  Friends  hater among my peers, simply have to fall in love with those nitwits).  She's an extremely intelligent young woman, but when it comes to TV, she's simply out of her league.  I mean, really.  Come on, people.  Why am I ranting like this?  Why have I launched a near jihad against Friends and its soon-to-come spinoff Joey?  Because...it's fun :-)  Besides that, I'm going to watch the show tonight.  And before you go getting your long johns in a wad, it's not from positive motivation.  No, no, no, my friends, that would be all too sweet a victory for those Friends-lovers.  I'm watching the collection of what NBC executives and Friends producers consider to be the best all-time Friends moments.  This will be the moment of truth.  Will the show past my litmus test?  Will it convert me into the cult of fanaticisity?  Ha!  Wouldn't you just love to see that?

      Wow, it's...over...  It was a joyous occasion when I felt the home turf under my weary feet again.  While I was only gone for approximately 2-3 days, it was still good to get home.  This past weekend was seriously one of the best experiences of my life ( the  best except for maybe JSA @ Stanford, and maybe even better).  Honestly, there's not one single thing I would change about it.  You know what the funny part is?  I didn't even win.  It was a strangely relieving feeling not to hear my division number and name called out at the truly incredible awards banquet/closing ceremony.  Sure, I was disappointed, but for some reason that didn't overpower the great sense of personal accomplishment I was feeling after having spent the weekend with five (well, more like four) inspiring individuals.  I ended up as one of the five other "runner-ups", and after a brief conversation with one of the board members, it appears I was #2.  That was somewhat comforting.  So it went down like this: I was the last to arrive in Beautiful Downtown Reno, Nevada (the self-proclaimed "Biggest Little City in the World" and in my opinion, the crappiest).  It's great when the first things you see upon stepping off the plane and into the airport is a sleu of slot machines and and an advertisement for a gentleman's club.  Gotta luv Nevada.  Then, we find my commanding officer, find a shuttle, and begin making our way towards my weekend hellhole, er...hotel...wait, no...motel.  Crackhouse?  Hmmm...rat house would probably be the best term.  Anyways, I ended up being late for our first function (thanks, Staff Sergeant P for giving the best dang directions on this side of the Miss-uh-sippi).  Coupled with learning that our oral board was not to be on Saturday as I thought but rather Friday evening, it was a rather stressful afternoon.  However, the landscape surrounding Reno was enough to quell my strong distaste for the Unfortunate Series of Events that was plaguing my afternoon.  There are beautiful snow-capped mountains on all sides of the city.  The view flying in was simply breathtaking, and it really made me consider moving Out West some day...and then I slapped myself and all was well.  The people with whom I competed were incredible.  One was from Cali. (SoCal, for those who are interested), another from Pennsylvania, another from North Carolina, yet another from somewhere up North and East (he had the strongest New England accent I've heard in a while), and another from Ohio.  It was great being from Texas.  As my fellow competitors so graciously pointed out, only two things come from Texas: steers and...well, you get the point.  To make a long story even longer, I had the opportunity to speak with a multitude of impressive people.  I walked in stride with generals, conversed over marketing with business leaders, and spoke before a board of six people who seemed to be quite impressed with my ability to open my mouth and issue forth words that came out in complete sentences...just not enough to give me first place.  Dang it, I'm supposed to be working on the bitter aspect.  I'm really not.  I even listened to a speaker talk about the difference between cows and rhinos; heck, I even became a certified rhino!  Keep charging!  No more "moos" from me, no siree!  The guy who won was the guy I predicted to win the contest a year ago before I even knew I would be competing.  He's sharp, smart (although he kept groveling over my 1370, which got kind of annoying), and reminded me of a certain newspaper staff member, which really helped ease some of the tension.  The experience was great, and I now have contacts from coast to coast.  For three days, I got to live out a dream: a true, bonafied, in-color dream that I will keep with me for the rest of my life.  Tomorrow I must wake up from said dream to take the dreaded AP English Language and Composition Exam.  Yeah, uhhmmm...methinks tomorrow should be fun.

      So I  finally  saw all of my best friends for the first time this summer.  Gah, I've missed them a lot.  Because I'm an only child (most of the time, but my lil' bro could be coming down for a bit this summer), I don't have anyone whom I can talk to/make fun of every day ;-)  Anyways, as we were sitting over some delicious Fazoli's breadsticks (I no longer hate Fazoli's; in fact, we're now having a love affair), my friend Jenny and I started talking about college while everyone else was getting their food.  It's so cool, because she and I are the only ones (although another newbie to the group Cacen is turning out to be as well) who are planning on going to school out of state.  Basically, that means that the end of March/beginning of April is going to be Hellfest 2005 for us because it's basically feeling like a sitting duck waiting to be lucky enough to be shot in the neck by a crapshoot college.  Meanwhile back at the ranch, we came to the startling conclusion that as it stands, if a woman gets pregnant TO-day, her child and our college admissions decisions should come in right at about the same time.  Cool, eh?  So, I'm going to one of those pregnancy tracker sites, randomly pick a pregnancy to track, and follow it.  Why?  Because I'm insane, but you already know that.  I think she and I just really psyched ourselves out about college.  Turns out Jenny's going to NYC at the beginning of August to check out NYU and have her interview with  urlLink Yale .  Mine's not until the beginning of next year, so I'll probably drill her about it so I can be fully prepared.  As I've been finishing up my essays for a couple of the colleges I'm applying to, I've been visiting a couple of sites for writing and interview tips, and I came across  urlLink one  that had a section on some rather "interesting" things found in some admissions essays.  Here are my favorites:  · If Homer’s primary view of mortal life could be expressed in a word it would be this: life is fleeting. · Such things as divorces, separations, and annulments greatly reduce the need for adultery to be committed. · Playing the saxophone lets me develop technique and skill which will help me in the future, since I would like to become a doctor. · There was one man in particular who caught my attention. He was a tiny man with ridiculously features all of which, with the exception of his nose, seemed to drown in the mass of the delicate transparent pinkish flesh that cascaded from his forehead and flowed over the collar of his tuxedo and the edge of his bow tie. · Filled with Victorian furniture and beautiful antique fixtures, even at that age I was amazed.  · As an extra, we even saw Elizabeth Taylor’s home, which had a bridge attaching it to the hoe across the street. · I would love to attend a college where the foundation was built upon women. · I enjoyed my bondage with the family and especially with their mule, Jake.  Haha, yeah.  Suffice it to say, that made me feel much more confident about my essays :-).  But alas, that confidence will not last long, for AP scores are now available over the phone.  I'm not going to pay $8 to get them, but just knowing that they're in stone and that I shall soon have them mailed to me...*shudders*  Life can be so cruel.

      All right, so I was watching Wimbledon (as I have been doing for the last 5 days) when it went to commercial.  I, being the impatient guy that I am, decided to flip the channel to occupy my time while advertisers had their field day.  Much to my horror, I came across the Teletubbies.  I mean, really.  WHAT are they?  Do they actually do anything?  I sat there completely befuddled as to how such a pointless program is on TV.  I tried contemplating the educational merits, but you see:  1. The Creatures from the Dark Beyond don't even speak English, nor any other potentially useful language.  They speak a hackneyed version of baby talk that would make my 10-month old cousins wave their binkies and holler.  2. They have these strange parallelograms on their stomachs that allow them to view small children's undersides in the water.  Yes, that's what I saw today.  The thought of some gruff, unshaven, beer-gutted 40-year-old-man in the water filming these small children was enough to make me shudder.  3. They have this baby face with rays shooting out of it that serves as the sun.  Does the baby face speak?  No.  Does it change expressions?  No.  Does it contemplate world domination from its high perch?  Probably so.  Stewie Griffin, anyone?  Recently, I have seen  The Ring ,  Jeepers Creepers , and  Final Destination , yet none of them have even come close to the freak-out factor of  Teletubbies .  Most disturbing of all is Tinky-Winky.  Now, there's always been this controversy surrounding this particular creature because he's purple and that's supposed to mean he's gay.  Whatever.  By far, the most disturbing part of this persona is that while the other three are blythe-voiced things that at least give the illusion that they're voiced by children, Tinky Winky is voiced by what sounds like a 37-year-old pedophile.  Imagine my surprise as I heard a man with an obviously deep voice trying to pass it off as a child's as they all began to speak in tongues.  One thing's for sure.  That program, if by some miracle (or perhaps curse) it's still on, will never see the light of day with  my  children, or my children's children, or my children's children's...yeah, you get the point.

      WARNING:  This is an incredibly long, incredibly sentimental post.  Viewer discretion is advised ;-)  *********  I never expect to come down to Austin and learn something, yet every time I come, I do.  Spending the last couple of days here with my grandfather has been wonderful, to say the least.  I was quite a bit reserved at first simply because I haven't stayed with him in over a year.  Apprehension was expected.  Nevertheless, this visit has been a wonderful opportunity for me to rediscover just how awesome--and we're not talking about  the warped, hideous teenage "awesome;" we're talking about "awesome" in its truest sense--a man my grandfather is.  I will never be able to understand how he, at 74 years of age and fighting a losing battle against pancreatic cancer, can remain as active, positive, and upbeat as he always is.  It's all about his attitude.  He never hesitates to talk to people; he's a born socializer.  He has the ability to make friends with the prescription-taker lady at a downtown clinic, he can joke around with the waitress at Red Lobster and make her crack what is perhaps her only real smile of the day, and he can express such an interest in my life as to make me feel for the first time in a while that others do have a real and vested interest in me and my future.  I write this only because this, as I said before, has been an incredible week.  Last night, my grandfather (or PaPa--pronounced paw-paw--as I like to call him) and I went to the Black-Eyed Pea.  Few were around, and even the restaurant staff seemed exhausted and uninterested.  After I engulfed one delicious chicken fried steak (and believe me, that's quite a compliment to BEP) and took a few pokes at what were supposed to be mashed potatoes, PaPa began asking me questions about where I want to go to college, what I plan to major in, and what my career interests are.  My automated answer began as I gave him my laundry list of colleges and my schpeel on where I stand in terms of career prospects.  However, he didn't stop where most people do; PaPa wouldn't bePaPa if he had.  Instead, I was treated to some of the best advice I've received in a long time.  My grandfather's a religious man, but he's never tried to force his beliefs on me (which has saved us from mashed potato fights at the dinner table).  Instead, he's been a strong force in encouraging me to find my footing spiritually and emotionally, which, as he says, will allow me to begin to separate what I want and like from what I don't.  The way he said it was so much more impactful than I just did, but it left it's mark, for sure.  I have seen just how far-reaching his influence is.  We attended a Tuesday-night worship gathering at Bethany United Methodist Church where Crossfire, an awesome local Christian rock band, was performing.  I usually stay away from worship en masse, but it was quite an enjoyable experience.  The best part of it was seeing so many people come up, hug my grandfather, and then proceed to tell me how lucky I was to have such a great man as a grandfather.  If only they knew how much I know that.  To make a long story longer, he and I went to Red Lobster today to meet a fraternity brother for lunch.  We did so because PaPa is determined to connect me with every person he knows who can help me, which is something that few people have ever done for me.  In fact, earlier this morning, he connected me with a certain Dr. Hill, who is a leading force at UT-Austin with whom I will now be meeting in July to discuss admissions, et cetera.  That wasn't enough, though.  PaPa wouldn't be PaPa if it had been.  I was able to meet a prominent Austin business man, Vice President of Global Supply Management at AMD, and the aforementioned fraternity brother who gave me some great advice on college and breaking into the business world after college (and post-MBA, which, thanks to him, I am now set upon getting) as well as a nifty business card that will allow me to remain in contact with him throughout the coming school year.  All right, at this point I know I've driven off everyone, but that's okay.  I needed to get this off my chest.  My grandfather's a great man, and it is my sole desire that he be alive at least one more year so that he can see me get accepted into college and see me walk across the stage and get the diploma for which I have been working so hard over the past thirteen (well, by  then  thirteen) years.  His warmth, love, wisdom, and compassion have touched not only me, but others.  The day that he dies is a day that this planet will have lost one of its greatest human beings.  Many will be strongly impacted by his departure, but few more so than myself.  He has been a source of inspiration, courage, and determination for me since I was old enough to comprehend just how influential he is.  Although I despise and hate to use the word "witness," he, if any, has done it.  I can only hope that he will be dearly rewarded for it when his time finally comes.  *********  You may now return to your regularly scheduled programming :-)

Yeah, gotta work on these bad blog colors to make 'em go together.  *shakes head*  ETA:  You know, the only thing I hate about Photoshop is that it makes you see candy when it gives you cod liver oil.  *sigh*  We'll figure this out one day.

      And we're back from commercial break.  LIFE was fun, but I don't want to spend a whole lot of time talking about it.  While I didn't actually  learn  a lot about free enterprise, I did get some good business tips from when I visited Fletcher Communications, a local PR firm.  I'm nearly certain that that's what I'm going to go into post-college graduation.  Not the financial/mathematical aspect, but the funsy/creative-type stuff.  I also had the chance to reconnect with an old Midway friend (circa 8th grade) who's more in the "popular" clique at school.  We spoke for the first day or two, and then she found the popular clique again, so pretty much rarely saw her again.  Don'tcha just love social stratification?  I did have some sort of epiphany while I was there, though.  I finally think I've finally discovered why most of my best friends aren't guys, or at least the "typical" guy.  My roommate and probably 80% of the male population at LIFE spent 19 of the 24 hours of the day talking about sex.  Yeah, guys, can we have conversations that are just a  little  more stimulating?  Intellectually, that is ;-)  I mean, true, someone may look "totally hot," but I don't think it's necessary to talk about it in the graphic detail that they did for most of the day.  Still, they were pretty cool people.  Oh, and I learned one more thing: people from Teague don't pronounce it like everyone else does.  It's not Teague-as-in-rhymes-with-"league," it's pronounced like Tig-as-in-rhymes-with-fig.  It was the strangest thing in the world, yet cool at the same time.  So I wrote my first college application essay just to see how it would feel, and it really wasn't that hard.  Writing within 500 words is extremely difficult for me, yet editing the essay has helped the Concise Factor of my style.  Right on.  What's on tap for the rest of June?  I honestly have no clue.  June has always been the slowest month of the summer for me, but I guess I shouldn't complain much.  Besides, it's thundering outside.  Reason To Celebrate #467.

      Ha!  I'm rocking on goals this summer.  Last night I started a novelette completely on a whim.  Strangely, I got into it and wrote a good intro that allowed me to get a feel for what I wanted the story to be, the setting, and the main character.  It's been fun.  The working title is "Pumps," but depending on where the story goes, that could change.  I'd almost forgotten how much fun writing is, especially since the only writing I've done within the last year has been for school or in script format.  Scripting is fun, but doesn't allow for quite as much creativity as narrating.  Hopefully I'll find my niche in both this summer.  So Sunday is the start of the Leadership in Free Enterprise program at Baylor.  I'm underwhelmed, but that was expected.  I have no earthly idea what this program is about--besides the obvious free enterprise...and the leadership within it--so I wouldn't know what to get excited about if I tried.  Nevertheless, I'll be rooming with a stranger (most likely) for three nights and doing  something  for four days.  Mmm...intriguing.  As long as it's not the Final Solution, I think I'll be okay.  I called Sunthosh today, and he reminded me without saying so that I need to get my butt in gear, get a membership at the Y, and start working out with him and Mike.  I've been doing stuff around the house, but nothing serious.  Coupled with my new I-have-to-eat-everything-in-sight plan for the summer, the workout sessions should shape me into quite a different persona before the end of the summer.  No more Sickly Stickly for me!  Exciting stuff.  I also get my hair cut tomorrow.  Nothing momentous.  I only bring it up because I wish for one summer I could grow my hair out, as well as my beard and moustache that I have to fight to keep at bay.  Ever since joining the Young Marines, I've had to keep my hair under strict control (except for the four or five months during the 7th grade when I didn't show up for drill), so I don't even know what I look like with longer hair.  True, my hair doesn't actually get "long," per se, but it curls and grows into a bush (afro, in modern terms).  I guess I'm just tired of it looking the same way it has been since that HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE day back in junior high when I decided that the fade could come back and got a serious whack job done to my hair.    *shudders*  I want change, but I don't want it  that  much.

      Hehe, yeah, I did it.  New title format.  We'll see how this works out.  All right, don't have much else to write about, so you know that that means.  RANT TIME!!! All right!  No subliminal messaging here!  There's one eensy-weensy (GIGANTIC) little thing that's been bugging me ever since I started using AIM.  Now, I don't use it nearly to the extent that some who stay on 24/7 (BUT I'M GETTING THERE) and can amazingly hold conversations with approximately 15 people at one time do, but I like to consider myself fairly versed in the ways of AIM.  Basically, when I use it, I follow the same rules that I follow in a phone conversation.  In fact, much of the terminology, structure, pace, and rhythm are the same that I use in a normal phone conversation (which these days are few and far between).  One of my pet peeves--a small one (I WILL CRY IF YOU BREAK IT), but one nonetheless--is when one party starts a conversation, both parties converse, and then one just suddenly ends the conversation by getting offline.  Now, before you start rolling your eyes and clucking your tongues, it's not just a "hey, I got booted off" kind of thing.  It's pretty much the same as if you get knocked off a phone line.  There are certain rules of phone/AIM etiquette, IMHO (if we're going to break it down to AIM terminology), that one should follow: greet, converse, and say goodbye.  If one of those is missing, somethin' ain't workin' right .  This has happened to me on several occasions with several--but not many by any means--people, and only recently has it started bugging me--so much, in fact, that it makes me not want to have a conversation online with said people at all (FOLLOW THE RULES OR FACE MY WRATH).  Come on, just one little three letter word would suffice: "bye."  Is that too much too ask?  Probably so, so I'll end my rant there.  I looked at  urlLink Pepperdine  today and loved it except that...well...PU and I wouldn't click too well on certain personal levels.  However, just looking at the pictures of the campus has only served to reaffirm my conviction that I will end up going to school in California.  Ha!--you say--but didn't you swear up and down that you wanted to be a New Yorker forever and ever amen?  Yes, but that was then and this is now, so there.  Nah nah nee booh booh! (YOU CAN'T CATCH ME!)  Eh...my head hurts.

      I love rain.  From my head down to my sp-LAIN.  Really.  It's awesome.  It's funny to think that at one point in my life, I was terrified of thunderstorms.  In fact, I look at my dog, who is struck my an unnatural and quite frankly self-destructive fear of rain/thunder/loud-noises-that-sound-like-thunder, and I think, "Hey, I used to be like that.  Ha!  Neurotic little kid."  I love thunderstorms now; the worse the better.  Now, I'm not asking for a full-fledged tornadic outbreak, but a lightning storm can be incredible to watch and, with the help of its accompanying sister Thunder, listen to.  Tonight was a big disappointment, though.  All boom and no substance behind it.  Sigh.  Maybe tomorrow.  Playing the piano is fun, too.  I can almost play through the book  Evening Reflections , which, if you'll remember, I bought around mid-May with the gift certificate I got from the conducting contest.  It really is a great book to play through: the music is soft, quiet, and simple.  Funny thing is, my mom looked at the book and said, "That looks too simple."  Yes, Mom, it is simple.  But simple doesn't necessarily equal bad in terms of (save me!  I just said "in terms of"!!!) music.  In fact, simple can sometimes be better than complex when you're talking about emotion.  But that's complex music stuff, so I won't get into that.   Rain, rain, don't go away. Come again and we can play.

       You suck, and I hate you.&nbsp; You're humid, sticky, nasty, foul, destructive, deceptive, ruthless, and childish.&nbsp; You and Drama should be best friends.&nbsp; That you stifle me with your clammy hands and hazy eyes makes me want to run into the house and vomit (that and your dear friend Heat Exhaustion).&nbsp; No amount of water is enough to quell your lust for my sweat, so I have no choice but to hate you for wanting to take my life.&nbsp; Only Winter can overcome you.&nbsp; Winter is my homeboy.

       It felt good to wake up to you this morning.&nbsp; Great, in fact.&nbsp; You rarely visit during the summer, and I miss you.&nbsp; I woke up especially early (10:10) to make sure I caught you, but in fact I only saw you as you flittered away into the cool breeze that made the crape myrtle trees giggle so much that their beautiful pink and white flowers fell to the ground.&nbsp; I went to get the mail, but my mother had already got it.&nbsp; I took the time to look around at the peaceful street without the annoying honking of electric scooter horns and at the concrete driveways with dying leaves flittering across them, as if making their last stand before death.&nbsp; You were sweet to me this morning, so I want you to come back and visit us some time.&nbsp; You're always welcome.

       You're silly, do you know that?&nbsp; I see you sneaking around among my friends, acquaintances, and enemies, and I wonder how stupid we are to allow you to manipulate our lives.&nbsp; Thankfully I've managed to keep you at bay for some time now, but I see you ripping apart relationships all around me.&nbsp; Go away and die, or something to that extent.&nbsp; Were you tangible, I'd take you by the scruff of your neck and box your ears.&nbsp; Yes, box them because you don't deserve a modern punishment since you're no modern entity.&nbsp; You're old.&nbsp; You're  so  old.&nbsp; You've torn apart ancient empires, brought the downfall of presidents, and brought out world to the brink of destruction.&nbsp; Do us all a favor and bother the Martians for a while...but then come back.&nbsp; I guess without you we would never progress.&nbsp; That's stupid.&nbsp; Yeah, okay, so we have to have you, but could you at least back off a bit?&nbsp; Life is complicated enough as it is.&nbsp; Just let me rest for a while, okay?&nbsp; 'preciate it.

       Wow, we had an interesting time, didn't we?&nbsp; While I appreciate the good times we had, many unresolved and somewhat awkward things between your school and I were resolved.&nbsp; Thank you for that.&nbsp; One of the most important gifts that you gave me was the knowledge that I am completely and totally unprepared for being on my own.&nbsp; That I can be confronted by a complete stranger who tells me that he wants to talk to me--someone he's never met before--because he wants to take his life is scary to me.&nbsp; And what did I do?&nbsp; I ran back into your safe arms, back into the bubble where things like that don't happen and people like that don't exist.&nbsp; Do I have some growing up to do?&nbsp; Hell yeah.&nbsp; Am I ready?&nbsp; Hell no.&nbsp; There were plenty of good times though: staying up until 2:30 in the morning discussing religion, philosophy, life, and  Star Trek  with my kick-ass roommate; laughing over the rise and fall of the Hip Hop Empire with a group in the dining hall; playing a cut-throat game of ping hong in Gregory Gym.&nbsp; You and I got along pretty well, although your classes left a bit to be desired.&nbsp; I won't hold it against you...actually, I will, but we won't talk about that right now.&nbsp; Grâce à leaving your best at my disposal, I've seen that your school&nbsp;isn't exactly the place for me.&nbsp; Would I go there?&nbsp; If no other on my list accepts me.&nbsp; Is that a bad thing to say?&nbsp; Since when have I cared ;-)&nbsp; Despite your endless attempts to shove UT down my throat--and yes, I understand that that was your job--I also understand that you couldn't mask inherent problems I have with the school.&nbsp; Thanks for the food, though.&nbsp; It rocked.

       You had friends today!&nbsp; I would congratulate you, but sometimes you look so serene when you're by yourself that I wonder if you enjoy your solitude.&nbsp; We--my friends and I--made a splash, to say the least.&nbsp; You giggled your happy foam bubbles of joy and provided a Goldilocks environment for us (not-too-hot, not-too-cold...).&nbsp; I regret not having spent more time with you this summer, but you were sick for the better part of the first half.&nbsp; Now that you're better, perhaps we can be friends again like we used to be.&nbsp;&nbsp;My mother and I are&nbsp;going to Austin for a couple of days, so you and Dad will have the backyard to yourselves gain.&nbsp; Don't get too lonely.&nbsp; Maybe raindrops will come out and play.

       Why is it so hard to write you?&nbsp; I have sat here for two weeks trying to figure out how to start you.&nbsp; I can write novelettes, poetry, and short stories in other languages, yet I can not  write you.&nbsp; You make me sick sometimes, but I love you anyways.&nbsp; It's fun to get you because I know it means something.&nbsp; Sometimes I'll get an e-mail and I'll delete it without reading it.&nbsp; I rarely if ever throw you away without at least looking at you.&nbsp; If somebody decided to put in the effort to use you to speak to me--and believe me, it is an effort--I think that's totally cool.&nbsp; But why is it so hard for me?&nbsp; I'm so used to being impersonal, I suppose.&nbsp; If I opened my eyes a bit and spent a pocket of change on a "God Bless America" stamp that I don't even really like, I think I could do it.&nbsp; It's hard to make an effort sometimes.&nbsp; It's hard to show someone you care.&nbsp; You really do make me sick...but it's a good kind&nbsp;of sick.&nbsp; Thanks.

       I'm sorry I had to touch you.&nbsp; You seemed so calm and serene lying on the cold hard concrete of the driveway.&nbsp; My mother doesn't like you, though.&nbsp; She says you're dirty and you have to be put away where no one else can see you.&nbsp; I know you're dead, but when I look at you it's like when I looked at my great-grandmother's face after she passed away.&nbsp; From time to time the wind will pick you up and I'll get mad because I had fit you into a nice, compact pile of conformity and homogeneity.&nbsp; Then I have to sweep you all over again, my back muscles straining under the pressure of having my tall frame stoop to your level.&nbsp; You play with me, and I know you do, but that's okay.&nbsp; There are so few to play with these days.&nbsp; Playing is for "kids," They say, but what do They know?&nbsp; Sometimes it's fun to play, even with you and the wind.&nbsp; But next time, please don't blow in my face.&nbsp; I have allergies.

      And so I have returned from another wonderful trip to beautiful Egypt, TX, population of probably no more than forty people or so.  It's so nice to return to the country after living in the "big city" (What? Did I say that?) for so long.  As usual, it was a pleasant trip.  I love it when I go down there: the two great-aunts who hold down the fort at our family ranch could easily take care of my weight gain streak.  Even when you're full to the brim, they always insist that you eat more just because you're a "growing child."  Haha.  Yes, Aunt Rose, I'm nearly 18 and in danger of being malnourished.  Good times, good times.  The highlight of the trip was when we discovered the PS2 stowed away in the Old House (the ranch is composed of two connected houses: the Old House and--you guessed it--the New House).  It was a ninja game, and a strange one at that.  There was no hand-to-hand combat.  It used a gun similar to the one from Duck Hunt way back in The Day, and for the life of her, my mother couldn't figure it or the game out.  Example:  MOM: Am I killing them? ME: No, Mom.  They're killing you. MOM:  Okay...well, have I hit one yet? ME:  No, Mom.  You're still shooting at the painting above the TV. MOM:  Oh, okay.  *pause*  Okay, now am I hitting them? ME:  Mom, you haven't even changed the angle of your gun.  Aim  at  the TV. MOM:  Okay.  *pause*  All right, now am I hitting them? ME:  Where are your glasses, Mom? MOM:  Wait, I think I got one! ME:  No, Mom.  They just got you.  Gotta luv generation gaps within my family.  My great-aunts still haven't seen the light of day with a computer.  They're still in awe of the brand-new plasma TV the family just bought for them, but they don't know how to work it.  They always get Alfred, the ranch-hand, to work it.  They still call the DVD player a CD player and a CD player a record player.  Good times, good times.  Tomorrow is important on two accounts: 1) newspaper camp--I get to see the oh-so-pregnant Mrs. B and her minions...er, students.  It'll be fun to see who's coming on staff for next year, but it'll be hard to even hold a candle to this past year's.  I completed my packet for the first time ever.  Yay!  2) After that, it's off to the orthodontist for me!  If you don't know what that means, shame on you.  You should know by now.  I should be looking quite different by the time school rolls around.  Mmm...I'm still not sure about this whole thing.  Let's hope it works out for the best.

I shy away from pain if at all possible. I'll tell you what: you let me alone for a while and I'll clean you really well. Deal? Deal.  By the way, the little imprints you're leaving in my bottom lip may seem cute to you, but they make my tongue continually rake across them.  Again, let's compromise.  I won't tear you apart, and you leave the artwork to the Picasso's.   Muchas gracias .      P.S. Your color rocks my face off.

       Hoy tuvimos ensayo sobre el capítulo 3 en español.  Siempre me gusta escribir en esa clase, pero a veces no me gusta la manera en la que Sra. Croft enseña.  Quiero decir, no es que sea mala, pero a veces hace cosas demasiado sencillo.  No puedo esperar el año que viene.  Luego, estaré en el español 4, el que es AP, y tal vez no hagamos cosas estupidas como pasar casi una semana estudiando el imperativo.  ¡Qué tonto!  A la próxima vez...

       Esto es el gran estreno de mi blog de español.  Tengo otro blog que es en el inglés, pero a veces quiero expresar como estoy sentiendo por el español yo no en el inglés.  Ahora mismo, yo siento muy español.  Después de la escuela, tuve una reunión del club de español en que contamos el dinero.  Me gusta mucha la clase de español, pero a veces siento que no aprendemos bastante o tal vez no hagamos suficiente para una clase de español de la nivel 3.  Quiero decir, querría quedarme en esa clase por el día entero, pero tenemos solamente por una hora para aprender las ciertas cosas, lo cual es muy mal.  Supongo que será mejor un día...quizás, ¿no?  Quizás...  Andrés

       Acabo de terminar mirando  Los angeles en América , una película de HBO que ha cambiando mi percepción de la vida.  La semana pasada miré la primera parte, y me gusté mucho.  La parte de esta semana era bastante diferente.  La semana pasada, la miré con mi madre, y había partes cómicas y tristes, en otras palabras, había un equilibrio que me dejó sentir muchas emociones.  Esta semana, sin embargo, no tenía ese privilegio.  El mensaje era diferente; el sentimento era mucho más pensativo y melancólico.  La película, la que era la cuenta de varias personas sufriendo del virus de SIDA en los 1980s, echó luz sobre los sentimentos de esas que sufren del virus y que tienen que luchar diaramente contra no sólo el virus, pero también contra la sociedad y las percepciones de personas homosexuales.  Lo encontré ser interesante porque tengo varias amigas que son homosexuales, y conozco de la lucha que tienen cada día.  Deseo que todo el mundo comprendan que todas las personas son las mismas; no son diferentes.  ¿Por qué nos luchamos cuando hay tanto más en el mundo y en el universo con que tenemos que luchar?  No sé, y esa es la pregunta que a menudo me pregunto.  Hasta que nosotros podamos darnos cuenta de no es importante cual preferencia sexual uno tenga o el estilo de vida que uno viva, continuaremos vivir esta lucha diaria contra la fuerza que es nosotros, y qué triste es.  Un mensaje largo por un mensaje que hace poco comienzo a comprender.

       Hoy fui a la Comisión de los jóvenes de Tejas en Mart de Tejas, y debo decir que era interesantísimo y aprendí mucho sobre el modo en el que la TYC (así se la ha apodado) funciona.  Mientras la mujer que nos daba la jira hablaba de las personas que había llegado allí y que estaría allí por un tiempo largo, yo podía pensar solamente en mi familia.  No puedo imaginar estar lejos de mi familia por causa de yo hice una equivocación que me quitó la libertad.  Aunque no lo diga mucho, mi familia me significa todo a mí.  Es la que no me deja hacer cosas que yo sé son mal.  Pero a la misma vez, tenía el sentimiento que había mucho más aprender de las personas que, en esencia, había sido entrampado por las condiones de sociedad y de sus vidas que, en algunos casos, habían sido mal fuera de la comprensión.  Si había personas allí que hubiera puesto tener vidas buenas, ¿quién puede decir que a mí no me pasará algo como eso?  No es confortable, decir lo menos.  Extrañamente, sin embargo, tengo ahora un sentimiento bueno que vino de aquel lugar horrible.  Ojalá que ahora pueda aprobar las cosas buenas en mi vida.  Esperanzadamente.

       He encontrado que me satisface más ayudarles a otras personas que para uno me ayuda.  Esta noche, he pasado mi tiempo ayudando a KWTX-TV, una estación de televisión local, para colectar los juguetes que otras personas de la comunidad trajeron a la estación.  Aunque no estuviera contento todo el tiempo, sentía que era importante que hiciera mi parte para ayudarles a otras familias que no tengan tanto mucho como mí.  A veces, es difícil percibir que la mayoría vasta de personas del mundo no tienen las oportunidades y las cosas que yo y mi familia tenemos.  Por eso, es importante que le devolvamos a la comunidad muchas de las comomidades que tenemos.  Cada año, hay gran cantidad de bicicletas que se entrega a la estación para el evento de servicio para la comunidad, la cual, a propósito, se llama "Toys for Tots," o, en español, "Juguetes para niñitos."  A veces, doy por sentado que unas de las cosas pequeñas del mundo son las mejores.  Es extraño que esas lecciones de vida se mostre en los lugares más inesperados.  Bien, es todo que quería decir.  Esta noche ha sido interesante, y cada año espero con placer anticipado "Juguetes para niñitos," y yo sé que hay alguien por aquí que tenga una Navidad buena quizás por mí.  Ojalá que tal cosa pase.

       Mi perrito Makeda está enfermo, y no me gusta.  Esta mañana, me despertí y despertí a mi mamá.  Luego, fue al corredor, donde Makeda estaba.  Todas las noches dormía allí­, y anoche no fue diferente.  Entonces, mi mamá se le caminó a Makeda, y le duele mucho a él.  Me preocupo porque Makeda ha estado enfermo por un rato, y tengo miedo que él vaya a morir pronto.  No quiero eso.  No quiero eso.  Esta noche, la banda de escuela tiene concierto.  Estoy bastante emocionante porque tengo solo en una de las canciones.  Nunca tengo solo, y por eso estoy muy contento.  Tocamos cuatro canciones: Country Gardens, An American Elegy (de los eventos que transpiraron en el Colegio Columbine; yo y un otro miembro de la banda vamos a dar las notas del programa antes de que la banda toque la canción), 13 Days of Christmas, y 'Twas the Night Before Christmas.  Esperanzadamente, todo pasará bien porque mañana es...  ¡¡¡EL VIAJE DEL CLUB DE ESPAñOL!!!  ¡Qué emocionante!  No puedo esperar, jaja.  El año pasado me di buen tiempo, por eso espero hacer lo mismo esta vez.  San Antonio está bastante lejos de aquí­, pero quiero que el paseo pase bien.  ¡Hasta luego!

       íQué día!  No es que era mal, pero algunos días me pregunto por que continuo ir a la escuela cuando continua me hace estar enfermo.  OK, no estoy enfermo en realidad (aunque mucho de la población de mi escuela están), pero a veces lo siento.  Hoy en la clase de español comenzamos a estudiar el futuro, el que no parece ser malo.  Sin embargo, sé que después de un par de días, vamos a repasar la misma cosa una vez después de otra vez porque es la manera en que nuestra clase se conduce.  Esperanzadamente, recibiremos nuestros ensayos de hace unas semanas.  Sra. Croft dijo que hicimos mal, pero ella dice eso a menudo.  Los démas de mis clases son aburridas y no parece que estarán mejor por un rato.  El inglés (el cual debe estar AP pero no es) es tan aburrido y estupido, a mi parecer.  La historia esté mejor si se hace tan buena como mi profesora dice que está, pero no sé.  Vamos a ver, supongo.  Pero es como el resto de mi vida...siempre esperar.

       ¡El mundo de la política es interesantísimo!  Ahora, estoy envuelto con la campaña de  urlLink Howard Dean  y no podría estar más feliz, no lo creo.  Anoche, acudí a una fiesta de casa con unos amigos míos que están bastante envueltos con la campaña de Dean también (como mis amigas Jenny, Rachel y Emily, así como mi amigo Jeremy).  Fue, en una palabra, increíble.  Sí, estuvimos allí para mirar el primario de New Hampshire, pero era mucho más.  Conocí a muchas personas como yo mismo que están envueltas en muchos aspectos diferentes del mundo político.  Poder conocer a personas como eso ha sido una sueño mío por muchos años; por eso, me divertí inmensamente.  Una parte de mi trabajo con la campaña es escribir letras a votantes democrático por todas partes de la región.  Es algo que Jenny, Rachel y Emily hacen hace varias semanas, y ahora quiero juntarlas para ayudar con el esfuerzo de votar.  Mi vida ha tomado una significada nueva con esta campaña.  Nosotros estamos tratando de principiar un capítulo de JSA (el programa con la que estaba envuelto a Stanford), y me interesa ver adonde irá esta.

       Es la hora para escribir un mensaje nuevo, ¿no creen Uds.?  ¡Qué semana loca!  Tanto pasó, pero a la misma vez nada pasó.  Al primero, quería escribir algo que fuera filosófico, pero a veces no es la mejor cosa de hacer.  Por eso, voy a escribir...y escribir...y escribir hasta que algo que tenga la relevancia aparezca.  En realidad, lo que debo estar haciendo es leer mi libro, mi libro horrible  Las uvas de ira , pero he llegado a la realización de que no voy a completarlo.  Estoy en la página 12 de casi 600.  Es horrible, yo sé, pero no me importa ahora.  Me alegro de escribir en español, trabajar en el francés, el cual, a veces, parece ser imposible, y hacer las cosas que  yo  quiero hacer.  El verbo del día está oler, el que quiere decir en inglés "to smell."  Ahora, sé todos los verbos de sentido: ver (con los oyes), oír (con los oídos), tocar (con las manos y otras partes del cuerpo), gustar o saber (con la boca, o especificamente, la lengua), y por fin oler (con la nariz, una otra palabra nueva del día).  Ahora, puedo decir unas cosas como "el aire huele a rosas hoy" o "olfeteé la violeta, la cual tenía una fragrancia bellísima."  Los gustos del idioma española.  íQué bella!

El año pasado no era tan bueno como quería que fuera, pero no era completamente mala.  Había cosas que eran verdadmente increíble (como mi quedo en Stanford), pero no era lo que quería.  Este año, quiero hacer las cosas que he querido hacer por un tiempo largo.  Quiero aprender más que he aprendido antes y quiero hacer más que he hecho.  Es el año de las experiencias nuevas.  Ojalá que sea el mejor año que he tenido.

       ¿Ya ha acabado el fin de semana?  Este fin de semana ha sido buenísimo sencillamente porque no he tenido que hacer nada.  Bien, no exactamente  nada , pero no he tenido que hacer mucho.  Nevó el sábado, lo cual era increíble porque vivo en Tejas.  A propósito, no tuve que ir al Young Marines.  Lo bueno era no tener que despertirme temprano.  Realmente, dormía hasta las 10 de la mañana.  Por lo general, eso no pasa a menos que esté enfermo.  La semana pasada era maravillosísima por la cause de Corrigan.  Por seguro, era la semana de San Valentín, pero para mí y mis amigos, era la semana de pasar el tiempo con los amigos y divertirnos.  Me gustaba mucho.  Es una seis semanas nueva, por eso voy a tratar de hacer mis notas subir.  Espero no recibir unas notas tan malas como la seis semanas pasada, pero no sé.  Me falta recibir buenas notas para estar listo para mis aplicaciones de universidad que vienen pronto.  Vamos a ver, supongo.

       No hay nada como los exámenes estupidos que pueden hacerte preguntarte por que decidiste a estudiar español en la escuela.  Seriamente, el examen que tomamos hoy en el español fue ridiculoso.  La línea de tiempo fue horrible, los dibujos de los artistas fueron casi irreconocibles, y la carta que tuvimos que escribirle a un amigo imaginado fue estupido.  A veces me pregunto como nuestras profesoras inventan los proyectos que nos obligan hacer.  No lo comprendo.  No obstante, fue lo que tuvimos que hacer, y al fin y al cabo, hemos terminado el estudio de los artistas españoles y el arte español.  No es que no me gusta exactamente, pero la manera en la que fue presentado fue mala, creo que sí.  Pero estamos terminado, y por eso no voy a hablar no más de ese.  Hoy aprendimos que alguien dentro de nuestra escuela tiene la meningitis bacteriana.  Es en una palabra: malo.  Fue malo porque mi amigo Alec, que cumplió 17 años el viernes pasado, no estabas en la escuela hoy.  Según su novia y mi amiga Emily, se hizo enfermo a algún punto por el fin de semana.  Aunque supe que no lo está

       Por causa de alguna razón que no sé, no escribo en mis otros blogs.  Quiero solamente escribir en los que son de los idiomas extranjeros.  Mi vida está buena.  Nada me pasa mal, o lo que creería yo estar mal.  En todo caso, yo no espero con placer anticipado para abril porque es el mes en que tengo que hacer mil cosas.  Tengo el concurso para el Young Marine del año, tengo que estudiar para los exámenes de AP, y tengo que competir en el concurso de los conductores jovenes.  En realidad este concurso es al fin de marzo, pero es cerca de abril, y por eso...  No sé porque escribo hoy.  Escribí en mi blog francese, así que quiería también escribir en mi blog español.  ¿Por qué?  Es pregunta buena...pero no sé la respuesta.

       Estamos en las vacaciones de la primavera!  Bien, yo sé que duran una sola semana, pero quiero decir que quiero tener vacaciones desde hace varias semanas (en realidad, desde hace la Navidad, por seguro).  No sé lo que voy a hacer, pero cuando yo necesite saber, preguntaré a mi madre.  Ahora, estoy disfrutando los gustos de no tener que asistir a la escuela (¡y qué bueno que es!).  Creo que voy a trabajar en cosas varias que he querido hacer como las lenguajes, escribir, leer (me falta hacer ese porque no lo hago para mí mismo hace meses y posiblemente años), y otras.  ¡Es la hora de la felicidad, y voy a disfrutarla al fin!

       Otro fin de semana ha pasado, y es el tiempo para pensar en todo lo que tengo que hacer este mes.  Tengo concursos, conciertos y exámenes en que tengo que pensar.  Tengo estrés personal y emociones violentas dentro de mí.  Pero siempre digo que todo está bien...todo está bien, pero en realidad no es el caso.  De hecho, tengo tanto en que pensar.  Hay cosas de las que llego a estar emocionante, como el concierto en que dirijo la Banda de la Comunidad de Waco.  Hay otras cosas como el concurso del Young Marine del Año que viene el 29 de abril.  No sé lo que voy a hacer.  Debería hacer algo, pero tengo pereza; es decir, no quiero hacer nada.  Me divierto en haciendo las cosas que yo quiero hacer.  Eh, estoy hablando de cosas de las que he hablado por un tiempo largo.  Un otro tema...  ¡Qué lindo era hoy!  Era bonitísimo por seguro.  Las reclutas del campamento militar tuvieron hoy la entra del título de Young Marines.  Me alegro de que haya terminado.  Me caen las reclutas, pero quiero tener sábados libres de nuevos.  Tal vez estudie para el concurso...o tal vez no, jeje.  La noche ha llegado y necesito estudiar el italiano y ¡¡¡UN IDIOMA NUEVO!!!  Sí, es la verdad, porque ahora he comenzado a aprender el portugués.  Es dificilísimo; de hecho, es la más difícil lengua que todavía he estudiado.  ¡La pronunciación es tre-men-do!  Tendrá mucho tiempo para aprenderlo, pero estoy emocionante.  No creía empezar un idioma nuevo hasta que el verano llegara, pero de todas formas quiero empezar a aprender un cuando el verano llegue, pero será el alemán.  Era el plan al principio, pero ahora quiero poner el portugués allí también.  Cuando llegue a dominar bien el portugués y el alemán (y en realidad el italiano también), quiero hablar con fluidez en  seis  idiomas.  ¡Seis!  Las posibilidades son infinitas...

       Bien...no es exactamente la verdad, pero se parece a esa.  Este verano voy a escribir una historia pequeña (o quizá larga; depende en cuánto tiempo le dedico) sobre algo que me importa.  Sencillo, ¿no?  Se equivocan, mis amigos.  Es bastante complicado porque tiene que ser en español.  Claro, debe ser fácil porque hablo español todo el tiempo, ¿verdad?  De nueva, ¡se equivocan!  Escucho mucho el español (en la televisión, de todos modos), pero no tengo a menudo la oportunidad de hablar con personas en la lengua.  Tal vez debo formar un grupo para los que quieren hablar español con freceuncia.  Consideraré esa idea.  Así voy a escribir una cuenta pequeña o larga que va a ayudarme a mejorar mi abilidad de dominar el idioma.  Con el tiempo, puedo hacerlo.  Esperanzadamente...

       ...y viene rápido.  No creo que estar más feliz con la llegada del verano.  Con el verano viene:  1) Tiempo para hacer lo que quiero. 2) Tiempo para descansar. 3) Tiempo para participar en actividades divertidas. 4) Tiempo para tener tiempo.  ¡Que bueno!  Tengo pocos exámenes por hacer, pero después de tomarlos, todos mis estudios de mi penúltimo año.  Hay tantas cosas que quiero hacer.  Necesito trabajar por seguro en mis estudios de idiomas extranjeras porque no he hecho nada con ellos por un rato.  He dicho que estoy tratando de aprender dos lenguas nuevas: el italiano y el portugués, pero raramente hago algo con ellos.  No puedo decir que hablar cuatro o cinco idiomas cuando en realidad hablo tres.  Bueno.  El verano ha llegado y con él viene la promesa del divertimiento y de la felicidad.  ¡Viva el verano!

       Me divierto aquí con mi abuelo.  Hemos hecho tantas cosas que es difícil que las recuerde.  La experiencia es sin duda la mejor parte.  Mi abuelo conoce a tantas personas que son tan influyentes.  ¡Toda la gente de Austin parece conocerlo!  Es facíl ver por qué todos lo quieren.  La lluvia debe estar pero no es el caso.  De todas formas, nos divertimos mucho y una parte--una parte pequeña--de mí no quiere irse.  Sin embargo, tengo que asistir a cumpleaños de un amigo, así que debo irme.  Lo voy a extrañar :-(  No tengo muchas oportunidades que verlo.  Aún así, me he divertido y voy a tomar esta experiencia conmigo cuando vuelva a casa.

       No puedo comprender por qué el mundo hispano (o tal vez solamente el mundo hispano de televisión) está obsesionado con "Big Brother".  No me tiene sentido, pero por alguna razón, todos lo disfrutan.  En todos los programas de entrevistas, los presentadores pasan la mayoría del tiempo hablando de lo que pasó en el último capítulo de Big Brother.  Es ridículo.  Hace unas noches miré "Ultimate Dodgeball" en GSN (el canal de programa concurso).  Extraño jugar este juego.  Lo jugábamos todo el tiempo en la clase de educación física en la escuela primaria.  Los equipos son cómicos; hubo los pazguatos y los deportistas y otros grupos que representan los aspectos de nuestra sociedad.  Me distraje por un rato mirándolo.  Este fin de semana mi familia y yo vamos a viajar para ver mi abuelo.  Es bastante enfermo con el cáncer.  Va a morir pronto, así que vamos a tratar de pasar tanto tiempo que podemos mientras que vive.  Mi familia vuelve el domingo, pero voy a quedarme con mi abuelo para que podamos tener tiempo juntos.  Hace mucho tiempo que no visito mi abuelo a su casa, pero espero que esta vez tenga sentido.  Sé que no tiene mucho tiempo, por eso quiero hacer lo que queda el mejor.  ¡Julio consigo los correctores dentales!  Hace mucho tiempo que los espero, y por fin voy a conseguirlos.  No podía en el pasado porque los dientes no eran bastante fuertes a causa de un accidente en la clase de baloncesto cuando estaba en octavo curso.  Espero que ahora estén en mejor condición.  Creo que es todo por ahora.  Me aburre el verano, pero no es que no tenga cosas por hacer.  Es que estoy vago ;-)

       Estoy cansado pero no sé por qué.  Parece que la vida me pasa pero sé que no es la verdad.  He sido divertido mirar los programas españoles en la televisión como  >.  Me gusta ver que me molestan los conductores tanto en español como en inglés.  Una mujer es loquísima.  Si la veo en la calle...  Anoche traté de mirar una película en francés con subtítulos.  Por lo común no me gustan los subtítulos, pero en este caso eran necesarios.  Los actores hablaban tan rapidamente que era imposible entender lo que decían.  Era ridículo.  Ahora la tempestad está al umbral de mi casa.  Me gusta escuchar los estruendos del trueno.  Cuando era joven, el trueno me asustaba, pero ahora me gusta como nada más.  Es espectacular la manera en que la naturaleza marcha.  Me encanta.  Necesito hacer algo en vez de lo que hago ahora.  Hasta pronto.

        ¿Cuantas veces?  Quiero saber.  Siempre tengo que preguntarme cuántas veces voy a cargarme con las cosas y la gente que me hacen nervioso.  Sí, nervioso, porque no me siento a gusto con los que me exigen tanto.  No quiero continuar luchándome para que otros puedan estar feliz.  El tiempo ha llegado.  Ahora voy a dejar atrás las emociones que impiden que yo haga lo que quiero.  El tiempo ha llegado.  Me aburro de luchar.  No tengo bastante tiempo que luchar.

       Fa fresco questo giorno.&nbsp; Non mi piace il tempo quando è lo stesso tutto il tempo.&nbsp; Adesso posso uscire e divertirmi perché fa buen tempo.&nbsp; Vado a Dallas più tardi per ascoltare una persona da Yale.&nbsp; Spero che vada bene.&nbsp; Vederemo.

      Ho bisogno di scrivere più nell'italiano.&nbsp; Ho lavorato alla lingua ma è difficile.&nbsp; Tra il francese e il e il spagnolo, è difficile trovare del tempo.&nbsp; Provo a dedicare più tempo a studiare.

      Ho ricevuto il mio orario per el anno scolastico che viene e sono molto felice di avere ricevuto un buon horario.  Credava che riceverei un cattivo, ma no è il caso.  Voglio comencare presto ma tuttavia devo ammettere che ho goduto l'estate.  Era bene.  C'è molto che devo fare prima che cominci la scuola.  Spero di avere abbastanza tempo per imparare più l'italiano.
