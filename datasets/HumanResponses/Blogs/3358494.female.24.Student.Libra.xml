      I am happy to say that I have not smoked one cigarrette.  It has been super hard and I have been a little short with people lately.  I do not care what anyone says.  It is not in your head.  I recieved a comment that fights with my sister would be funny.  So since we recently had one I guess I will put it on my blog.   Well my sister came home and before she even got in her room she was yelling at me and telling me to get off the computer and get out of her room.  So I picked up the jar of peanut butter on her desk and strategicly launched it at the bedroom door so it would hit her as she walked into the room.  She called me a really bad name and threw my keys down the hall and under a chair.  She also told me to get off the computer again because she needed it.  So inspite of her throwing my keys I pushed the power button on the computer and completely turned it off.  She yelled at me again and I grabbed the hanger on her bed and threw it at her and she caught it and threw it right back so I picked up the phone and started to throw it at her and my mom started yelling so I got my keys and ran out of the house so my sister would get the worst of the punishment for waking up the beast.

      I have decided to blog my effort to quit smoking.  I think now is a really good time to quit with gas prices soaring and I really want to start walking and getting in shape because I have big plans for when I get done with school.  I have not had a cigarrtte since yesterday @1145 pm,  I have also not purchased any and I have turned down offers from "friends" to let me bum one.  It has been really hard but when I got gas I paid at the pump so I didnt have to go into the gas station.  The worst is driving in my car.  In the car is where I smoked the most.  But I downloaded a bunch of EMINEM rap and that keeps my mouth moving.  so my oral fixation is satisfied.  I guess.  the really nic ething is that my hair still smells like my favorite shampoo and my clothes still smell like fabric softener, not stale smoke.
