						   Some how this isnt getting along.i just dont like this too much.Blogging!whats so great in it.People talk so much about it.But what is so great about it?i guess its just alot of hype.ok it is interesting for others to read and even for you to read after a few years.but then all this typing is really irritating but i guess its not that bad.Actually it is pretty good

						   Ive been playing Fifa games since the release of FIFA 99.Somehow EA Sports has been able to churn out good football games year after year.Even though alot of the game sdo have flaws(quite a few of them)they do give you a good gaming experience.I started really liking it from Fifa 2000 onwards.I hardly played Fifa 01 but the few times i did it was a great experience(and a revolutionary one after Fifa 2000).Fifa 2002 is one of the games ive played the most(2002 and 2002 World cup).It was a great experience specially playing mplayer with a friend of mine.Fifa 03 also got the craze on and i played it more than 02.I downloaded the creation center for it and all the latest patches and boots.The thing i really like in 03 was sprinting down the wing and then sending in an inch perfect header to score a goal(what a feeling).When Fifa 04 came through at first site it didnt seem that good(due to the hard learning curve tof the new features like Off The Ball Control),but after a few days it really turned out to be fun.Playing with one of my friends for hours and hours a day.Even though it is full of bugs and flaws asi said earlier it turns out to be a pretty good gaming experience.(specially Multiplayer)

						   Ive got a bicycle(WOW!!!!).well its nothing great.it looks like a really fast racing bike but it dosnt have gears os its not exactly that fast(unless you have the muscle to speed it up).Anyway today as i was coming up the Regional College hill the chain came off,so i stopped and tried fixing it.It took me quite a while but then after about 10 minutes,8-9 tries and a set of very dirty hands i got it.It was a pretty good feeling.

						   Yesterday my computer was in stand-by mode and when i turned it on again some BLUE screen came on.i coudnt understand anything so restarted it.Nothing again.I check the BIOS and the computer dosnt detect a Hard-Drive.I get the feeling its a crash.But then today  i take it to my computer guy.He sees it lughs a bit andjust juggles around a few wires and voila!i see th XP Professional loading screen.What a life saver.

						   As everyone already knows HL is the greatest FPS and ofcourse Comp. Game ever to hit this planet.Ofcourse there are always those critics who say DOOM was better.Well maybe Doom was the game that spawned the FPS genre and all and ofcourse it was really good(at that time).It gave us Multiplayer.It was the begin of a new era of games,the beginning of a genre that would go on to become the most liked and played genre of games.It gave us FPS.It gave us the thirst to blow away Demons. Somehow even though it did start everything Half-Life did better.It was the first FPS to have a strong storyline,the greatest AI yet seen,non-scripted event and ofcourse a modding community and MODS that are yet being played on full flow(CS).Was Doom being played five years after its release(i guess no).Well in the next six months or so HL2 and Doom3(In August)will be released and again we shall all decide which game deserves it.

						   Ok so now ive finished the game.It was one the best game experiences i have ever been through.Even though it is an out and out FPS,where you just go on shooting incoming monsters.You pretty much only need a quick reflexes and a smooth mouse. Painkiller is one game which has Gore in more abundance than Kill Bill Vol.1.When you shoot something with a powerful gun it just breaks up into all kinds of pieces of meat(specially with the painkiller).i have to go will continue this later.

						   Ah Blogging,a thing that ive just started but have got really addicted.Its really good to write down what ever you want irrespective of whose going to read it.I think blogging is also very popoler due to the fact that there is no format or rules you can just type whatever you want however you want,whether its about your life or about any other thing you can do what you want.Personally i jsut write whatever i like whether ts my day or something i like,whatever comes to my mind.

						   I just found this great new software on the net its called Virtual DJ and is great for mixing on the spot music and for aspiring DJ's.It allows you to do all kinds of stuff like put in effects and loop.It even mixes the beats automatically.Its a really great software.If you want a sloghtly more basic software i would say try out Atomix Mp3.

						   Painkiller is just this completely crazy game where you just go on and on killing "Demons from Hell"(Ofcourse thats how it's supposed to be.But it's really good fun though.You just keep on blasting(except when you reach a checkpoint).I found that the game was not very tough in the medium difficulty mode and wasnt too easy either.It was just right. Graphics wise Painkiller is top notch.There are thousnds of textures and for everything People Can Fly(the developers)have taken pains to make as beautiful as possible.From the enemies to the tables and chairs each thing has its own look and feel.Talking about feel,the physics of this game are completely upthere with all the best games ever produced.If you shoot a demon from close wit a sho gun he flies away whereas from far he hardly gets a few shells in him.Another notable feature is the way the Stake gun stabs Demons and pins them to the wall or the ground. Although i havnt finished the games as yet its looking really good.Im right now in the docks which i think is the third last stage.I will continue this section later after i finish the game

						   Computer Gaming has been around for quite some time now and is really starting to take off as a Professional Sport.In countries like the USA you can actually make a living through just sitting at home.Unfortunately in a country like this one(India)it is just at the beggining stages of becoming a Professional Sport.Slowly and Unsteadily companies are putting there money into games and promoting them.One of the major causes of computer games not taking off in India is due to Piracy.If you could buy a game for a 100 bucks then why spen 1k on it.People here only think of the money they are spending and not on the amount of time and Hardwork put in by the Developers. Computer Games are also considered to be a childrens thing right now in India,but slowly it is improving though mainly the elder people consider this a childrens play thing.In fact even when a 15 year old asks for a game they ask "kya tum abhi bhi yeh sub kheltey ho?"(Do you still play all these things).Sorry,iv'e got to go.Will continue this article later.

						   So,as I was saying lifes not all that good for gamers in India,though(thank God)it is improving alot(slowly).In cities like Pune and Bombay it is really taking off in a big way.With Cyber Cafes opening up only for gaming.I should also give alot of credit to Reliance for setting up their Webworlds all over the country.This is one of the first somewhat Professional Cafe of the country,unlike other pay-per-hour services. MMORPG have been a some what scarce commodity but with the occurence of this new game by an Indian Developer Ragnarok though i havt tried it things do seem to look really bright ahead In smaller cities though the thought of even gaming is just propping up,except a few people others have just started playing games(atleast some progress).Multiplayer games are somewhat completely out of the topic. Ok so anyway life goes on and so does progress.Who knows India may be a World leader in gaming and game development some day(yeah right............someday.......)
