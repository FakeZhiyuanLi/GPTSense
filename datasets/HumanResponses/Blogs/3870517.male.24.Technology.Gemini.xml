       Everything went out just fine last night; I was watching soaps on TV and catch the episode on CSI on TV. The CSI episode was amazing, a man charged with arson and the fire brutally killed his wife and his 8-year-old son. Mel was with me watching the episode and before the episode ends, VJ called my attention. He was asking me to buy them dinner; he and Jups were finishing their reports for their submission today. I went out to buy and when I came back I missed the last part of CSI and Mel told me everything about it. We ate our dinner in the staff room. Jupanie told me that she borrowed a VHS of a movie entitled "Holy Ghost" of which I have never heard of. I was thinking maybe it was an independent movie; most independent movies here in the Philippines are released only&nbsp;on video. It starred Kate Winslet and Harvey Keitel, directed by "The Piano" director, Jane Campion.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  The movie was all about an Australian girl (Winslet) who went to India and was captivated by the guru of an ancient belief.&nbsp;Her amazement led her to live in India to become one of the wives of the guru. Upon hearing this situation from a friend, who was with her when they traveled to India, her family decisively planned to hire a “cult exiter” (Keitel) to get her back. And the rest of the film became an intriguing tale of love, sex, passion, and lust.  &nbsp;  I was so consumed by the film's story&nbsp;when VJ and Jups came and told me that we are going to The Venue. It’s ladies’ night so Lotlot and Jups will not be paying any fees and besides they wanted to have some good night of fun and dances. Off we go to the place despite the rain the heavy rain. Unfortunately, Ladies’ Night is not really free for ladies, they will have to pay half of the entrance fee. We paid and got ourselves in a huge place where everyone was having the time of their lives. The live band played a mix of hip-hop and R&B, they got a nice rapper although I must admit that I can’t figure out what he was yelling. We ordered four bottles of beer, fries and a pizza. The waiter asked us that we have to pay for the beer because it’s not included in the fee. Off they go dancing while I was waiting for our orders at the table and taking care of their belongings. The second band for the night started their playlist with a mellow. Everyone got back to their sits and listened. When the dance music came back and our orders came, we get to feet and went to the dance floor leaving out things behind. Anyway, their where people sitting next to us and would notice if our things will be stolen.  &nbsp;  Everything went fine until the clock hits one in the morning. We went back to the center and I finished my viewing while they are busy finishing their reports. I fell asleep after watching, woke up early, went home, sleep and came to the office late.  &nbsp;  I’m out.

      I was a teacher back when there were no jobs available for me. I got the job easily because the school was in a hurry to hire one and because the classes are about to start. I found the job hectic and tiresome, I get to shout at some of my hard-headed students, I sometimes think too much on whether to pass or fail a student. It was more than just a mental activity, talking for long hours about the same topic to different classes; I was like a pirated CD.&nbsp; I was teaching college students, and some of these students were about my age or older so I get along with them very well. It seems awkward that they pay courtesy to me even though they knew all that I am younger than they are. The uniform is the only thing that separates me from them and my position but on days when I will not be wearing my uniform, I am sometimes mistaken for a student.  &nbsp;  During break times, I get to sit with my students, talking anything from their classes to their evening gimmicks. Sometimes, I got invitations from them, to join them in some of their crazy nights drinking and spilling beers and other intoxicating liquors. Although I must admit that the invitation was tempting because most of my friends where not here in Davao and some are busy with their jobs. But what I always keep in my mind is that I am their teacher and the distance between our obligations in the institution must be kept apart, as much as possible. If my co-teachers would invite me out, I won't have to think about the invitation. There are rules and regulations and even ethics that I must follow once I became part of the institution.  &nbsp;  On the recent seminar I attended on Team Building our facilitator stressed to us that when a person is joining an organization, he has to adapt a new kind of behavior being set by the rules and regulations mandated by the company. I do agree with her as long as the rules and regulations are beneficial to me and the company. She said this behavior is called the adaptive behavior. These behaviors are not being taught in our own home and we only exercise if we are inside the company. These include punctuality, observing the dress code, wearing IDs, and a lot more. This behavior also applies to universities and schools where girls are required to where long skirts and such which they have to wear. Basically, these are implemented to create a harmonious relationship among co-workers and to promote good character of the company. These behaviors are not meant to be kept with us wherever we may go but when the time comes that we leave the company, it then that it is taken away from us.  &nbsp;  So to speak in relation to the teacher and student relationship, as long as I am a teacher, I should not cross the line so to be able to achieve the effectively of the said behavior. I was thinking, if I gave in to the invitation, what would happen tome then? They might take away their respect and my position might become questionable. Should I care? Yes, because it is what I should as part of the institution.&nbsp; &nbsp;  If I am not part of the school anymore, I do not bring the behavior with me. It is only then that I can join my students, I mean my ex-students, in their hang-outs.

      Last Saturday, July 17, everyone was gathered around the parking lot of Davao Teen Center, there were at most 20 of us. Saturdays are always been the time of our spiritual formation, a day in a week where all of us share what we think about a certain human value. It became a tradition to invite our friend from a Bible college here in Davao, a foreigner and preacher named Zach. Zach will be the one who will share to us the insights about the value according to the Bible.  &nbsp;  So then and there we started the session. Our Youth Coordinator started the discussion with these questions: Is it easy for you to forgive? Have you had forgiven someone? Have you been forgiven by someone? What situations or instances do you think where you cannot just forgive someone? What situations or instances do you think where you&nbsp;can easily forgive someone? How long does it take for you to forgive?  &nbsp;  A lot of us shared our thoughts to these questions. One of us shared his situations that&nbsp;he once had an argument with a friend of his, his former best friend. The argument became so furious that they don't want to see each other anymore. He tried to have contact with him and eventually everything went fine. He said that committing the mistake was so simple but the act of surrendering yourself to ask for forgiveness is difficult. He can easily forgive someone if the action is minor, other than that would mean that there is no more connection. He said forgiving someone is a kind of relief to him because the burden created by such misunderstanding is too heavy that sometimes he thinks of the situation more than his studies. So it was in his perseverance that everything now went as good as how he wanted it to be.  &nbsp;  Of all the questions raised,&nbsp;only one&nbsp;among those given where we have common answers. What are those instances or situations where it is hard for us to forgive?&nbsp;The answers were&nbsp;betrayal of trust, backbiting, and cheating (on relationship). Although these are not the crimes punishable by law like rape and murder, these things are so meaningful to being a human that when committed by someone, will eventually attacked your emotional being.  &nbsp;  On the topic on asking forgiveness there where two points raised by our facilitator on why it is sometimes&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;to ask for forgiveness, shame and guilt. I was struck and it made me feel bitter because it is a fact. Sometimes, it becomes hard for us to ask for forgiveness because we know we did something wrong and we are ashamed of ourselves because we did such thing that could ruin a precious relationship.  &nbsp;  Time passed and still there were a lot of ideas being exchanged. The time came when Zack will give us idea what the Bible says about forgiveness. He gave us copies of the testament and asked us to read the passage. The parable was about the man who owed his master and was asked to pay his debt but he couldn't and he was forgiven by his master. When he met his co-worker and ask his co-worker to pay his co-worker's debt, his co-worker couldn't pay him so he scolded him. The master saw this and called his attention and told him about what he had done to him and that he expects him to do the same to his fellow. After the reading, Zach asked a representative for a demonstration and he showed us a plastic chain. He wrapped it around the volunteer's body and locked it. He said that we are like the volunteer who lived in sins and the sins are our chain. If we continue to commit these sins, we will be living in bondage. He stressed that when Christ came to live with us, he untangled this bondage and free us on our sins and wanted us to never commit the sins again.  &nbsp;  The discussion ended with a little bread shared among us and some chit-chats. It is very heartwarming for all of us to have at least an opportunity to share everything we have and what we experienced so that all of us can learn from each other and understand one another. I will be looking forward on what we will be sharing again this coming Saturday.&nbsp;

      Last night me and my friends were able to watch on tape the movie Serendipity. A story about how can destiny be able to have two people fall in love even in the most inconvenient way. I was so touch not because it is a romantic film, it is because it dwells so much on how we, human beings, rely so much&nbsp;on destiny and fate. As the film progress, it was visually interpreted that a person has to work on what he/she wants and destiny will just be his/her side.  &nbsp;  There was a&nbsp;scene in the movie that strikes me most, where Sara's bestfriend was in a confrontation with Sara herself, she mentioned that if destiny do really exists, and that everything in this enormous world has a plan already, then why don't we just sleep all day and let destiny work its way?  &nbsp;  This kind of belief is sometimes misinterpreted by most people, that our lives has a already been planned. It might be a force or a being, regardless of what we believed in, it is a reality. Most of us look for signs and signals from these forces, a sudden drop of rain in a hot sunny day is interpreted as a good sign, to sight an example.  &nbsp;  I know someone who is so devoted to this belief, that his life has been planned already. He gets into a relationship because he believes there a sign has been given to him that the girl he has met is meant to be his love of his life. He does eveything to his ability to keep the relationship going, even to the extent of losing his interests in dating some other girls. He is though still young and unemployed. When the girl told him to look for a job, so he did just to please the one being destined to him.&nbsp; His life goes on for so many years keeping the relationship together and even planned for their marriage until one day he met another girl. It was an unexpected meeting, he meet an old friend&nbsp;on his way home who was with someone who attract his attention. His friend is working in the same building, just a floor ahead&nbsp;where he is working and the girl&nbsp;is her officemate. From that day on, the three of them go out together for lunch and get to know more about each other. He became fascinated with the girl's charm that he can't stop thinking about her but he tried not to because his inner self is keep on telling him that he has someone already. He has never felt that way before in his entire life, like he has met someone who might be his soulmate. But he is also telling himself that her girlfriend is&nbsp;his soulmate. He can tell the difference of the feeling whenever he is with his grilfriend or whenever he is with the other girl. He was so consumed with his destiny that he has not been able to explore the reality that there is so much in this world that he has not discovered. The dilemma continues until today.  &nbsp;  I will just focus this issue on relationship itself. Just an observation, most guys or girls marry because they have to, because they have set time for theirselves that at this certain age they have to be married, something of a societal issue.&nbsp;A fact also is that if you don't have a girlfriend or a boyfriend at a certain age, expecially older, you are either gay or just a hater of a relationship.&nbsp; We believe so much about what other people say or what the forces has installed for us that forget to believe in ourselves. What do&nbsp;we really want? What do&nbsp;we really need? Most relationship are stable not because&nbsp;they want to but because they have to. Both parties tries to build a beautiful family because it is the next phase of life after being single and because they believe they are destined to do so. We became to fixated to the destiny being laid upon us.  &nbsp;  There are so many choices in this world that we haven't&nbsp;choosen and most of these we either painfully or have to pick. After all, it is either we say sorry for ourselves or live with it because the fact is, we chose it.

       on Trust...   How do you trust a person? Some says trust is too expensive to be given. Some asks for price. Some choose someone who can be trusted.  I could still recall what my cousin is always stressing about trust, 'Keep a friend and love him such, but never know him too much, because if a friend becomes a foe, your secrets, the whole world will know.' isn' that scary?  Well, for one, i am a person who easily trust someone whom i have had a talk for maybe a month. I mean whom i know not as much as i know my bestfriend. But i always keep in my mind that the choice is always been mine. The choice to have this person carry the burden of my trust. It is a burden to that person, especially if it is a secret. As i was saying, trusting a person is a choice, you can never ask someone if you can trust him/her because it is you who has the nerve to give trust to that person. It is now up to the person being trusted what he/she is going to do, what he/she is choosing to do with the trust. It is becomes the person's choice what to do with the trust you have given him/her. Do not blame the person if he/she betrays you, it would be better if you are not going to see that person again, to avoid violence or whatsoever.  As you may have noticed, it is all about choices. If the other person is a keen chooser then i guess you have made a right choice of whom to trust. This is what I usually do, I have to make it a point to know if the person i am about to be trusted knows how to rightly choose even in smallest situations, like buying things, choosing places to hang out, etc.  You may use a lot of technique like me but still, it all boils down to one thing: choice.    on Respect...   We used to hear from our parents to respect older people. If you're older than I am, you will have my respect. Do you really need to be respected?  Conflict and misunderstanding arises when one of the parties do not respect the position of the other party. Expect quarrel, bad words, skyrocketting-objects, punching and even death. War is the worst of them all. People not respecting other people, people not respecting others' faith and beliefs and principles. Respect is not as costly as trust. Respect can be easily given without you yourself getting hurt.   Why do people older than i do needed respect? How about the younger once? It is like in the workplace, when someone who is in the higher position than you, you are expected to respect that person. Is it acceptable? Well, it has become a norm. Everyone is exercising it. But of course, respect can be taken away once our morale is damaged. Like when i used to work as a lecturer in a school, I was really irritated by my boss everytime she shouts at my fellow lecturers (I must admit I haven't been shouted by her). Some of them cries and some leave their work and never come back again. Back when I got the job, I was able to appreciate everything my boss has done for the school but as time goes by everything changes. The place becomes a jungle where my boss is the lion and we are my boss' preys. With the situation, I have decided to quit before I loss my temper on my boss.  Sometimes it is hard for me take back the respect I have given because respect is so important that it becomes the reason many misunderstands, even war. The war in iraq is the effect of "unrespect" because two or more people do not respect one another. If you value respect, let is flow through everyone, a small amount of respect can give this world a peaceful turn.  Here's a scenario where trust is very much neeeded. There were two people (A & B) who works on the same organization and has been quite fine dealing with each other, almost to the point of being bestfriends. In an unfortunate circumstances, the other party (B) failed to keep the closeness that they had established. Then there is another person, a third party (C), who wishes to make things right (which C thinks) for both parties. Nevertheless, both parties (A & B) fix what has been broken, sins has been forgiven, but the closeness can never be back again. A says that since they belong to the same league, A would better act as civil and professional as possible, and stresses that this is all A could offer B. B agrees and believes that what has been can never be restored, at least B could still talk to A.  Upon hearing the arrangement, C thinks that it is all bullshit and unacceptable. So C wanted more than what the 2 parties has agreed. Isn't C should respect the decision of the 2 involved? C has just stepped into the area where C should not be, invading what A & B know belongs to them. C never respect their stands and worst of all added insult to the injury.   Respect is so simple that it can create a harmonious atmosphere between all of us.    On Sincerity...   Need I say more? Isn't lies acceptable? When in doubt? Some of us used the world 'jamming' or 'ride on' to emphasis that saying the things been said is because we just want to make an impression to a certain person.  How sincere are we when we deal with our angst, our emotions, our thoughts? According to dictionary.com sincerity means as the quality or condition of being sincere; genuineness, honesty, and freedom from duplicity. Quality is how good you mean the things you say or do. It follows that even if you are honest, you have to check if your honesty has quality. Condition is how do you feel your being genuine. On our latest team-building seminar, our facilitator refers sincerity to where your thought and feelings come from, if it is from your heart, that is sincerity. I do agree and this is the only way we can be able to weigh our being sincere.  Sincerity comes when you trust and respect someone. Trust and respect go along with sincerity because it is the measurement of how much you mean to trust and respect a person. You can respect a person without trust but not without sincerity, same way that you can trust a person without respect but not without sincerity but would it be better if you respect and trust someone with sincerity?  I'm out!

      I have heard so much rave about the transition Judy Ann Santos has made from a bubblegum-pop-like actress into a more daring and adventurous one. It has affected my senses and brought me to see the movie.  Sabel is a story of a nun, who was raped by a prisoner and as the story goes, we are brought to series of flashbacks to fully explain her identity. Sable is so much like all other women who longs for love and justice in the world and we were thankful that in the end she did found what was hers.  The movie’s progress in storytelling will not get you bored. The flashbacks are quite necessary for so many explanations that the movie has to do. I was able to sympathize with the lead man’s longing for his lost love. Wendell Ramos has delivered a good acting in finding his lost love but eventually in the end settles on someone else’s arms. I was asking myself at the end of the movie, ‘Am I supposed to sympathize with Sabel?’ I have read a column in a newspaper that says that Sabel is supposed to be sympathized. Maybe I was dragged to this thinking. But nevertheless, I don’t think I have too. Sabel is someone like us who are still looking and longing for that thing called LOVE and don’t need other’s sympathy. Judy Santos truly delivers her best as Sabel, every scene of hers is a must-see. The sensual parts of the movie were perfectly directed. Just a thought, would it be better if the story started in the courtroom?  What I hate about the movie are the noises that backgrounds the scene where Sabel is confronting a prisoner who is attempting to commit suicide. I was leaning on my seat figuring out what she was telling the man. But that did not distract my concentration.  The movie has an excellent story which is, unfortunately, for Filipinos who are privileged enough to get a good education because there are lots of discussions that is going to happen once you get out of the cinema. It is a kind of film that needs a lot of intelligent to be understood because of the complexity of the lead character that is being presented to the viewers.  I'm out!

      Everybody needs somebody who will fill in there longing to have someone to hold and hug and kiss and everything for the rest of our lives. Everyone is looking for someone somewhere else. There's the internet, the old-time-style pen pals, and even blind dates. What ever medium it maybe, it is undeniable that everybody is looking.  Famous of them all is the internet. There are lots of dating service available online, there are chat rooms, everything... A lot of people too a getting much profits from these form of businesses... There is this friend of mine who imagined herself getting married to a foreigner, not because of money, just the fondness to the white races... She constantly surf the net and chats with whoever wanted to chat with her, as long as the person on the other line is caucasian... There's also another kind of girl who wishes to marry a foreigner to have a prosperous living... For her, it is her only escape from poverty... These scenarios are common to woman, but what about guys? Some guys don't think of it as a way to get married but for satisfaction, i mean cybersex... It may sound nasty but it is a fact... Some do look for a companion but it is uncommon...  We may have varied reasons to these so called fashion but I can only think of one, the need to connect... the entire universe is so huge for all of us to get connected and we have been wondering what would the other people on the other side of the world be doing at this point in time... we have known this and we have made the necessary inventions to satisfy these needs... Time will come, when we will know that we are not alone in this universe, are we still eager to invent new approach to connect with them?... could you think of yourself chatting or having cybersex with an alien?... hahahahaha! NASTY!  I'm out!

      I am lazy, I do accept that I am really lazy but i do like going to work. I've heard it many times I've been called a lazy person. I might be the only lazy person who loves going to work instead of hanging around doing nothing.  I love going to work only and only because my time doesn't require me to report at a specified time. I am supposed to work 9 hour a day, but at times I just have 8 or seven hours. Hahaha... I am lazy indeed...  I don't know why i easily get restless especially in the afternoon where everything is hot and not a good time of the day to take a sleep. so i just opened some of my projects at work, do something which i think would require me to think much so i will not be thinking more of the sleep. at times i am tempted to drink coffee which i have been trying to avoid. i've been having at least a glass of coffee a day for almost a couple of months now and i want to continue this discipline.  After lunch break, most of us have at least 30 mininute to have a siesta or do something out of work. Sometimes, i do feel sleepy that i lay my head on my table and just think of a thousand sheeps jumping over the fence... But I feel like someone is calling my attention, my computer is urging me to surf the web... Aaaarrrgghhhh! There's Friendster, Yahoo!, Inq7, everyone... My Yahoo Messenger is giving me notices that i have a message and my computer beeps everytime i receive a message from Outlook... how can i ever take a nap...   By the time the clock's hands hits six o' clock, i feel like i wanted to sleep in the office and dont want to go home... i am sleepy... i yawn and yawn and yawn... almost every second... Is there someone out there who can help me with this?  Ooops, it's 1pm already. Time to go back to my work... Ciao!  Im Out!
