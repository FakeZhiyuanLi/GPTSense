      Yeah, yeah, what about the diet? I weighed in at 131 this morning. I still don't want to do much number crunching. I have 3 full weeks invested in this diet and haven't lost as much as I wished. Actually I'm just being impatient. The facts are: 1) my clothes fit looser, 2)I am not fatiguing (is that a word?) out at the gym, and 3) I am losing.  The gym part makes me happy. I quit trying to kill myself on the cardio. I now am running at a pace that gets me going pretty good, but I don't stumble around the weights like I did the first week. During this last week it seems my lifting is at the level where I left off before vacation.

      Friday. I have been on this diet since Sunday, the 2nd of November, so I've been on it for 13 days. How do I feel? Tired. I've been waking up a lot at 1-2 in the morning and not really been able to fall asleep. I tend to doze off at work. I'm not sure what to do about this; it is not doing anything really but just sapping any desire to work.  Notebooks are useful for tracking trends. I'm looking back at the beginning of this year. Looks like from January 27th through February 22 I lost 9 pounds ( 137.5 - 128.0). I'm pretty sure that was straightforwards Atkins diet - no calorie counting whatsoever. I pretty much went up and down until the beginning of March, the 7th, I weighed 127. March the 19th I weighed 125. I stopped dieting around then. So I dieted more or less for 52 days and I lost 12.5 pounds. I blame stress and beer for not sticking to my guns. I'd like to match the time (don't know about the weight loss).  Yep! Says I was back to 132.5 on June 6th.  I tried to start over on the 14th of July at 137 and stopped on the 15th of august at 128. How depressing. I went wild until Novemver 1st and popped to over 140. Bleah.   What I'm watching:  Actually I'm watching three things right now, The Sopranos, The Forsyte Saga,  and Band of Brothers. I've seen BoB before, first time for the other 2 which I'm renting from Netflix. I bought BoB on DVD because it is a damn great piece of HBO programming.   I won't comment on BoB; go to  Television Without Pity  and read Heathen's recap/critique. She's more critical of the first few eps, but I can't argue with the criticism (hard to tell everyone apart, mainly). She slowly but surely warms up to the show, and she falls madly in love with Major Richard Winters. I sympathize. Yow, what a man!  And like Heathen, I became totally smitten by the actor who plays him (Damian Lewis). Never had a thing for a redhead before. Anyway, I mentioned on a message board what I thought of Richard Winters the character, and one person responded that that was fairly gross because Lewis had played a really creepy bastard in some BBC production called the Forsyte Saga. That's why I'm watching that show. Yep, he is a major creepy bastard. Soames Forsyte is 180 degrees different from Winters. Kudos to any actor who can play such diverse people so convincingly.   The Forsyte Saga is about an English family. For such a reputedly repressed bunch, they sure do like to boink around a lot. That's not a criticism, just an observation. Soames Forsyte is the apotheosis of repressed. He also has no social skills, and he judges everything in terms of posession. Deep in his creepy, shallow, heart, however, he just wants to be loved. Ick.   Naturally, he falls in love with the exact wrong woman, Irene, who is an icy bitch. She marries Soames and then doesn't even pretend to try to love him. Soames needs someone who is as hardheaded and practical as he is. That way they could treat their marriage w/ negotiation -"Ok, honeybunches. I want a ruby necklace and a couple of new dresses and I'll have sex with you every three days for the next two weeks". "Sweetiepie, if I give you a ruby necklace, I want sex every day for at least a month". "Three weeks, every other night". "Okay, deal!"  Oh, yeah, there's a bunch about the rest of the family, but this is the story line that's holding my attention, repulsive as Soames is. Besides, Welsh hottie Ioan Gruffudd shows up to play Bosinney the architect, whom Irene is making googly eyes at. Bitch. Wanker. Yeah, yeah, Soames is a git so they all suck. Still, two hotties are worth the price of rental.  Speaking of families and boinking around, that brings me to the Sopranos. I would like this series better if there was someone whom I could genuinely like (or maybe a good-looking Brit or two). I do enjoy it; I love mob movies, but I have a lot of time invested with these characters and none of them show any morality. Well, there was one scene where Tony's wife goes to a therapist and the therapist bluntly tells her to get out of a marriage with a gangster. The therapist's clear-cut stand on what is right and what is wrong was a refreshing and shocking change of pace. She doesn't listen (or hasn't, so far). We're in the middle of the third year.  One ep depressed the hell out of me - one about strippers at the club Tony Soprano and his crew run/hang out at. One girl is brutally killed by her mobster boyfriend and out of all of them only Tony shows any remorse at the poor girl's death. The rest are just pissed at the boyfriend for making a mess and causing a potential situation. I'm glad the writers allow Tony the occasional glimpse of humanity because the rest of the time he's a pig and the show would be unwatchable if he was one full-time.

      History is kind of finished, overexcessive pontificating and obsessive number crunching ahoy:  I started this diet on Sunday, November the 2nd. Today I weighed in at 133.5 and 29% body fat. I averaged about 1332 calories a day.  What does it mean? Not a doggone thing, yet, because it's just one week. I will need another week to do more comparisons. Note the rapid weight loss in the beginning of the week(I weighed 137): most of this is water loss. Remember rule 5.e about glycogen: my stores are depleted. My body has switched over to fat burning (ketosis) which I know because of those little strips of paper I pee on.   This phenomena also tends to increase your body fat percentage. Remember, that which is not fat is everything else which includes the water your body retains. Less water, bigger ratio of fat. No big deal!  More weeks, more data, and the more I can make better and better estimates on how much I need to eat a week to lose one pound a week. The aggravating thing will be that the more I lose, the less I will need to eat to maintain the one pound a week weight loss.  Oh: more boring fun. remember 2.e Fat/Carbohydrate/Protein ratios:65/5/30. When I do the math on the averages (I won't bore you further with the calculations) it came out to be 1332 cal (avg) 709 cal fat, 128 cal (Carbohydrates) 495 cal protein (each gram of fat=9 cal, carb=4 cal, protein=4 cal). So my ratio was 53/10/37. I'm fine with that. I'm in ketosis with the amount of carbs I'm eating and I really do want to eat 1 gram of protein per gram of body weight. No, my kidneys are fine!  Since my gym partner is a man (sexism ahoy), my gym workouts tended to have concentrated on the upper body. I have tried to increase the amount of leg work I do. I cut out leg presses and do honest to goodness butt-to-hamstring squats. I'm thinking of adding a deadlift, but I'm not quite ready for it.   I also want to replace Lat Pulldowns with chin-ups. Like most girly-girls, I have a tough time with them. But I can do 2 in a row. I think I'll switch to a gravitron eventually (another machine). I'd also like to put a tricep exercise in that requires a barbell or dumbells. FYI, when I do situps or back hyperextensions, I increase weight, not reps. Why on earth would I want to do 100 of them? Bleah! Easier to do 15-20 and increase weight when it gets easy.  When I start to try to gain weight, I will periodize (see Krista). For right now, I simply want to get back into the groove (after a massive 3 week layoff) and focus on form. Especially squats, which is the greatest exercise on the earth. I have only been doing real squats for the last 3 months, and it made a phenomenal change in my legs. They still look chunky but thats the body fat.

      Okay - boring diet history: I once dropped to 117 unintentionally when I started skydiving. Considering that I was a couch potato and falling out of an airplane isn't that physically exhausting I'm still not sure why this happened. It must have been the adrenaline.  Anyway, I got used to it and regained back to high 130's. I got married; when we moved in together, my husband complained of being overweight and wanting to do something about it. I did a little research and we started a low-fat diet. It worked. He got to 165 (From over 200) and I went down to 124. Both of us were still couch-potatoes.  Our biggest problem was slowly regressing back to our poor eating habits. Jon, to his credit, stays mainly at 180-190 pounds, but I went right back to the high 130's.We have been married since 1999 so we have been yo-yo dieting for 4 years. So, you might wonder: why should this time be different?  My biggest reason for being optimistic is that in 2000 Jon got me to go to the gym with him. The place where I work has one for its employees. Free and convenient! At first he tried to get me to do aerobics - bleah! It's too close to dancing and I have 2 right feet. Then I discovered something - weight training. Holy crap, I have come to love weight training. Despite the flab I could see and feel muscles and I made good progress (at first).  It took a while of going to the gym on again and off again, but we finally do it out of habit (in other words, it just feels wrong not to go, like it feels wrong to me to climb into bed and not brush my teeth). That was a big step for us, and a big clue to me as to how to treat a diet.  After initial great gains both of us stalled out on weight gains and did the on again off again diet thing. Up, down, up, down but at least the weight training was a constant.  I'm not going to post weight training information here, not when  Mistress Krista  has this most excellent site chock full of good information on weight training for women and much of this info applies to men, as well. She also has good  sections on diet.  Where was I? Oh, yeah, why this one will be different. See rule 1.e about weight training; I have finally accepted the fact that I can't gain muscle and lose weight at the same time, so I have picked weight loss to do first. I want to develop the habit of eating right - and the first rule is to eat less than I need to maintain. One of the reasons for this blog is to help me keep on track, to not lose focus of my goal.

      Background information: I'm not that overweight. I'm 5'2" and weigh 136. I weight train, so for better accuracy, my body fat percentage is 29.4% which roughly means I'm carrying 40 pounds of blubber on my bod. Most in the typical female areas - hips, thighs, waist.  Below are my diet rules; bits of wisdom I have picked up over the diet rollercoaster I have ridden these past 4 years.  I have one huge caveat - this is what seems to work for me. When I follow it. Your mileage may vary.   Rule 1 : Weight loss is a matter of physics. You have to eat less calories than your body expends in a day. That part hasn't changed, no matter who claims what.  Here are the tricks I use regarding rule 1:  a) To lose weight, multiply your current body weight by 10 and by 13. So if you weigh 240 pounds, you should eat between 2400 and 3120 calories a day. Obviously if you want to lose faster, eat more towards the 2400. Don't think that if you go even lower you will lose faster. All you will do is be hungry and kill your metabolism.  Say you want it to be (relatively) fast. Take 2400 and divide it by how many meals a day you eat. I eat  5, and I highly recommend it and eat each one at least 3 hours apart. This will keep you for the most part from being hungry and prevent huge insulin spikes. Any way, that means you can eat 480 calories per meal. That's a lot.   You can adjust these numbers a little for convenience sake. Say you want a larger sit-down dinner of 600 calories. simply don't eat as big a 1st Breakfast. It does not matter  when  you eat! As long as you eat less than you burn, you will lose.  Less is not neccessarily better, because if you don't eat enough, your body slows its metabolism and starts breaking down muscle. It also causes bodily stress. Crash dieting is useless. If you lose only 1 - 2 pounds a week, you will lose more fat than muscle.  b)The best exercise for weight loss is weight training. Why? Because it helps prevent muscle loss, and muscle is more compact and burns more fuel. Try to train at least 3 times a week. More is not neccessarily better because of overtraining, which can lead to fatigue.  A couple of comments on weight training: You cannot 'convert' fat into muscle. You either are losing fat or gaining muscle. With the exception of absolute beginners, it is almost impossible to do both at the same time. When you diet you weight train to prevent muscle loss.  Cardio training is also good for weight loss and of course helps your cardiovascular system. 20 minutes a day 3 times a week is plenty. If you start going overboard it will eat through more muscle.  It doesn't matter if you weight train first then do cardio or vice -versa or do them on separate days. Do what feels best to you. And if you have to choose between weights or cardio, weight training is better. Really!   Rule 2:  A reduced carbohydrate diet is better than a reduced fat diet. Read the low-carb books for the physiological reasons. My reasons for low-carb are so:  a) Fat in your diet causes your brain to register the idea you are full. You will eat less if you eat fat. I don't worry about sources of oil; I love mayo, butter, etc. It does add up, so I tend to eat most oils in the form of salad dressing and grill my meat as opposed to pan-fry it.   b) Carbohydrates cause cravings. It's tough, but once you cut out bread, potatoes, rice, pasta, and sugar, after 3-5 days you quit craving it. As long as you are on it you will desire it.   c) Staying away from such carbs means insulin levels will be level. You will feel better overall. I never realized how moody I got until I stopped (well, almost stopped) eating all that crap. I have more energy and get more accomplished.  d) Good carbs are vegetables; your body takes a while to digest them. Some fruit is okay, like melons and berries, but eat them sparingly. I eat at least one salad a day plus one cooked veggie, like broccoli, snow peas, greens, or stir-fry. Sometimes I eat 2 salads.   e) Your ratio of protein to carbs to fat should (roughly) be: 30%\5%\65%. Or, eat at least 1 gram of protein per pound of lean body mass(if you weight train). Do not skimp out on fat! Again, this will help you maintain the muscle you have.  f) If you weight train, invest in whey protein. Find a brand that tastes good. Take a certain amount (I take enough to give me 20g of protein, more than enough) after a workout so your body won't chew on its own muscle.   Rule 3:  Diets can be boring. Deal with it.  a)Always be on the lookout for new foods. I just tried spaghetti squash, and it is quite tasty.  b)Spices help. There are more out there other than chili powder. Vary them; find good cook books (at LEAST the Joy of Cooking).   Rule 4:  Tupperware (in the generic sense; that stuff's expensive)!  a) I eat 3 of my meals at work. I buy the cheap stuff so that if I lose one or have to throw it away because it was left in the hot car for 3 days I don't stress.  b) Try to prepare things ahead of time. If you make 3 batches of tuna fish salad or egg salad, you are set for one of your lunches for 3 days.  I also cut everything up for salads ahead of time, like green onions. Cut them all up at once, so all you have to do when preparing a salad is grab a handful out of tupperware and go.  c)Convenience foods exist, but they are not those gross protein/low carb bars (but hey if you like them knock yourself out!). Convenince is pre-cut/pre-shredded cheeses, deli meats, rotisserie chickens (mmmmmm). Always look at carb amounts on containers and stay away from store bought tuna/egg salad. (sugar).   Rule 5:  Don't get obsessed by the scale.  a) The best time to weigh yourself is when you first wake up, butt nekkid, after your morning pee. The numbers won't vary as much as other times.  b) During the day, the scale can vary by more than 11 pounds (it's the food/water/waste you eat/drink/eliminate)  c) Try only weighing yourself once a week on the same day at the same time (when you wake up). Daily will discourage you. Not that I don't do this.  d) How you look and how your clothes fit is far more important than how much you weigh.  e) On a low carb diet, you will deplete your stores of glycogen in your muscles and liver. Glycogen is a stored 'quick' fuel. One molecule of glycogen bonds with four molecules of water. You will experience maybe 5-10 pounds of water loss right at the beginning, especially if you are religious about low carbohydrates (20-30 grams of carbs a day). The reverse is true. If you eat an entire pizza, you will think you gained 10 pounds of water overnight. Don't let it get to you; just stick to the plan and that will go away in 2 -3 days.  f) Because you are no longer storing glycogen, your body will feel tired more quickly as you exercise. Work through it; your body will convert to burning fat.  g) Nonetheless, if you exhaust yourself, up your carbs a little before your workout. This is why I started eating oat bran. It helps.   Rule 6:  There is no rule 6.   Rule 7:  keep a log of what you eat.   a)Yes, it's a pain in the ass. But you must keep track of what you eat, at least until you make a habit of your meals. Many  dieters, I won't name names, blithely lie to themselves about how much they eat and then blame it on their metabolism. I don't doubt there are people who have messed-up metabolisms, but I wonder how many of them are clinging to it as an excuse to eat poorly and do no excersize? Write down what you eat and the amount.  b)The most accurate way to measure food is by weight. Buy a good scale and use it. Eventually you will know what an ounce of cheese or 6 ounces of hamburger 'looks' like and you can approximate it. Keep a spreadsheet of your most common foods and amounts and this helps immensly. No, I won't show you mine because it's not on a spread sheet. It's on paper. Okay, so I bend some of my rules.  Fitday  has an exellent (and free) method of logging your eating habits. Be religious about it!   Rule 8:  Keep temptations away from you.  a) Throw all the crap food in the house away or give it away. Don't have it around. If you have 'trigger' foods (mine is beer), try to find a reasonable substitue. If you can't, try giving it up altogether. Despite Michelob Ultra, I'm coming to the conclusion that I need to stop altogether or have it once in a very blue moon.  b) If some asshole at work buys everyone a pizza, it is easier to resist if you have only eaten an hour or so before.  c)If you JUST NEED SOMETHING TO EAT that's why God invented Slim Jims. Really! Slim Jims are a legit snack food. Gardetto's are not. Cheat with protein and fat, NOT carbs. Mmmmmm jerky!   d)The key to any successful diet is to get educated on food, learn how to fix your own food (though there are many shortcuts), learn how to determine what you can and cannot eat, and how much. Keep index cards of your favorite recipes and try to add one at least once a week.   -We will see if this works.

      Been a while. I got down to 129.5 just before Thanksgiving (the 25th) then I went kind of loony with the food. So from Wednesday to Sunday, I had a free for all. I finally started damage control on Monday, where I weighed in at 132.4. Here it is Wednesday, where I have dropped to 130.6 - I have lost the water weight I have gained. As far as I can tell, I put on a half a pound of fat.  I didn't stop going to the gym!   One thing I have noticed is that the gains (if you wish to call them that) I made when I did a periodization cycle (in a nutshell, do a few weeks of high reps -low weights, a few weeks of med reps - med weight, a few weeks of low reps high weight - total for me was about 8 weeks) just before vacation seems to have stuck. I have a lot of improvement in some areas. I was benching 3 sets of 75 lbs for 10 reps, now I'm doing 3 sets of 80 at 10 reps. I'm pushing it at that very last rep, but damn that's good for me!  Any way, I have been reading a lot about Cyclical Ketogenic Diets, and I may try that eventually. I'm thinking it may be more useful if I'm trying to bulk up but don't want to add fat, or if the Targeted Ketogenic Diet I'm essentially on now quits working for me.  The combination of moderate calorie restriction ( I'm eating about 1350 a day, and my maintenance rate seems to be around 1700 ) and a small boost or carbs on workout days has not sapped me of strength in the gym. This is big for me, because I was doind a straight low carb before and my lifting got to be way off.  I am working on stiff-legged dumbell dead-lifts finally. I tried some Monday -light weights, 15 pounders, but I must have done something right because the back of my thighs were sore! I did 3 sets more today. I'm concentrating on not rounding my back. Proper form, always!  I also need to start putting more weight on the squat, the bitch goddess of all exercises. My husband informed me that when he went to the dentist's yesterday, one of the assistants who is a trainer, told him that squats will make my hips wider. Guess whom I will never hire.

      Whew.  Friday: 19m55s 2 mile run. All exercises at 3 sets of 10 reps:    Military Press  50 lbs   Shoulder Fly  8 lbs  Barbell Front row 45 lbs  Squat  70 lbs  Stiff Legged Deadlift  80 lbs  Calf Raise  45 lbs  I'm working my butt off so I'll spare you too much verbiage. I did notice that I have a fondness for cute, fuzzy, and sociopathic animals when it comes to comic strips.  urlLink Sluggy Freelance  has the malevolent Bun-Bun, the miniature lop-eared rabbit. Here is one famous  urlLink exploit , but for sheer brutality this is my  urlLink favorite .  While he's nowhere near as Evil (with a capital E), I am also very fond of Bucky Katt from  urlLink  Get Fuzzy . He has his own  urlLink style .

      Ah, it was great to sleep late. For me; 5am is late.   Everyone is writing about freedom - now there's an abused word. I have always defined it as the condition of not being coerced. Threats and abuse seem to be the big tools for coercion.   Some people look at freedom and responsibility as some sort of yin and yang; I think they are more like a Chang and Eng.  Say I was on a deserted island, I'd be perfectly free. No one there to point a gun to my head to take what I worked for or tell me to pick coconuts for him. I would be 100% responsible for whatever happened to me, too. I'd be responsible for food, clothing, shelter, and my own safety. Oh, sure, a hurricane could come along and wash me out to sea, but that would be my problem and only mine.  Now take this society: I am forced to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes - by the same token my responsibility to prepare for old age is lessened (only if I'm an idiot, really). But many people don't pay attention to retirement because they don't think they have to. Since my taxes pay for police, firemen, army, etc. I am less responsible for my own safety (HAHAHAHAHA oh, sorry).   So if I was perfectly coerced, I'd be a slave and pretty much responsible for nothing. If I were raped, most of the right to life people would agree that I could get an abortion even if the laws were set to their standards. Note I said "most"; some would want to force me to carry the child to term.  People are always going to disagree about freedom and responsibility. Everyone pretty much agrees you don't have the freedom to kill. Some people will add: "unless you have been directed to do so by your government" but not all. Many people think it's okay to kill someone who is trying to hurt or kill you, but not everyone. Some people think it's not okay to kill animals and want the government to prevent people from killing animals. Some people think it's okay to go interfere in other country's business; some people think it's okay for some meat-packing dictator to abuse his people as long as he doesn't pose a threat to us.  Some people think homosexuality is okay, some people don't. Is incest okay? What if it's between two consenting adults? Is bestiality okay? If animals don't have rights and can be owned, what's the difference between owning a chicken and owning a blow-up sex toy?  Coercion has been monopolized almost completely by governments and criminals. And sometimes family members. Is coercion 'for your own good' a good thing? What if it's done in the name of the good of society? What about the children?  Sometimes I get the idea that people don't want freedom at all. They don't want to be treated bad, but that responsibility twin scares them. I get the idea sometimes that the vast majority of people would want what happened in the movie  urlLink the Abyss  to happen. Come to think of it, this was  urlLink The Day the Earth Stood Still  too. Every time I see The Abyss I think of that old Porno for Pyros song:  Will there be another race  To come along and take over for us?  Maybe martians could do  Better than we've done  We'll make great pets!   My friend says we're like the dinosaurs  Only we are doing ourselves in  Much faster than they ever did  We'll make great pets!   Me, I hope I can talk them into giving me a deserted island. Preferably one in the Caribbean with a nice beach.

      The best thing about today is I don't have to wake up early tomorrow to go to the gym. Hooray!  I ran 2 miles in 1m57s. FYI my treadmill habit is to run at a decent pace then go  urlLink balls to the wall  near the end of the run.  Chest and Triceps day: (3 sets of 10 reps each)  Bench Press  85 pounds. That's 5 more than last week, which was my mistake. However, I completed the sets with no problem so I'll keep the increase in weight.  Incline Dumbell Press  This is actually a photo of a decline dumbell press; I alternate declines and inclines every week. 20 lbs.  Dumbell Fly  10 lbs  Machine-assisted Dip  60 lbs. When I say 60 pounds on this one, it doesn't mean I dip me plus 60 pounds (I wish), it means I'm using 60 pounds as a counter-balance, making the dips easier for me.  Flat Bar Pushdown  I was calling these pulldowns before, but they really are pushdowns. 60 pounds. I also do a triceps exercise on the same type of machine with a rope - similar to this one except I pull the rope to my sides. I couldn't find a picture of that one.  Last night I watched  Dr. Strangelove . Despite the fact that I have seen every Stanley Kubrick movie  he made between  Spartacus  (which I loved) and  Eyes Wide Shut  (which was silly and boring), I'm not a big fan of his movies.   Even though I sometimes get the urge to feed my inner sociopath, Kubrick's coldness and dislike of people gets to me. When I am feeling down with people, I prefer  urlLink humor  or  urlLink horror  as an outlet. Kubrick's touch on horror was of course  urlLink The Shining  which I did not like. I think it boils down to his characters. They seem so far away to downright unlikeable. Even the most horrendously cynical story can be saved in my eyes if there's someone to root for. I didn't *care* about anyone in The Shining.  Dr. Strangelove, Kubrick's entry into the humor listing, I found to be okay but a little dated. It had its funny moments, thanks to Peter Sellers, predominantly. And I finally found out where the phrase "polluting our precious bodily fluids" comes from (a mad Air Force General tries to start a nuclear war with the Soviet Union apparently because he dislikes flouridation. Really).   Part of me wants to blame one of the scriptwriters, Terry Southern. He wrote a bunch of hip, ironic crap in the 60's and the 70's and being hip doesn't age well. Neither does irony. If you don't believe me, try to watch  Casino Royale . I have also read interesting reviews on  Candy  and  the Magic Christian . Okay, he wrote  Barbarella . Enough said about dated hipness and irony.  So in Dr. Strangelove, you had a huge glop of Kubrick's precision trying to mix with Southern's wit (General Jack D. Ripper, President Merkin Muffley, Colonel Bat Guano, funny stuff, yeah).  Kubrick's  urlLink Full Metal Jacket  is a funnier movie but now that I think of it, it's only because of R. Lee Ermey's amazing vocabulary.

      Tuesday!  That means Back and Biceps at the gym. I ran 2 miles in 20 minutes which just proves to me that yesterday’s lackluster run was due to a lack of sleep.  And just so people will know what I’m talking about, this is what I did at the gym today replete with urls (all exercises are done with 3 sets of 20 repetitions unless noted otherwise):   Lat Pulldown  80 lbs   Seated Cable Row  70 lbs.   Back Fly  10 lbs -  or more properly rear lateral raise, which is NOT a back exercise.    Preacher Curl  50 lbs  wrist curl  8lbs 3 sets of 15 reps  Barbell curl  45 lbs – except I’m not using an EZ bar like in the picture; I’m using a flat bar.  I also did Back Hyperextensions (15 lbs) but I haven’t found a good photo of that yet.     James Lileks writes a funny, interesting blog.   Who is he? I don’t know but I found him through other blogger’s websites. He’s responsible for composing that remix of Howard Dean’s “YHEEARG!” speech. Hey, I was reading him before his 20 minutes of internet fame.  His site has more than this bleats; I especially hurt myself reading/looking at his collection of truly awful men’s fashions:  The Dorcus Collection .

      Blech. I’m tired.  I did go to the gym this morning. It took me 23 minutes to do my 2 miles. I only did leg work for lifting, but the exercises I did were the big ones: Stiff-Legged deadlift (3 sets 15 reps 75lbs) and Squats (3 Sets 15 reps 70lbs).  I’m about ready to hurl after those babies. I still need to work on my grip some time during the week because I think I could easily handle more weight on the deadlift.  I also tested my chin-ups and I can’t get past 2 good ones.  Anyways:  I haven’t been a skydiving instructor for long; I received my rating last May.   My official rating is Accelerated Freefall Instructor.   The word ‘accelerated’ simply means the students (allegedly) learn at an accelerated rate as opposed to the old static-line method which is still used and quite popular in smaller drop zones. Accelerated Freefall (AFF) can be completed in as little as 7 jumps while static line can take 20 jumps. AFF is not less expensive, however.  The AFF instructor’s course was grueling. It consists of two parts: groundwork – which involves learning how to teach on the ground, and skydive work – which involves helping students during the skydive itself. ‘Helping’ includes giving the student hand signals to correct his body position, stabilizing the student should he need it, and even opening the student’s parachute should he need it.  Our instructor, Billy, insisted that students would do things to us that we wouldn’t dream of when we complained about how hard the skydive part of the testing was. He also showed us plenty of highly entertaining video to back up his claim.  My first Student from Hell was a very nice elderly gentleman who was simply not physically fit enough nor mentally ‘there’ enough to do an Accelerated Freefall skydive for his first jump. He was the poster child for tandem rides. He had a difficult time with the basic body position, called an ‘arch’ (hips down, legs out at 45 degree angle and bent at knees 45 degree angle, arms spread in lazy w even w/ head, eyes on the horizon). I worked with him individually many times trying to teach him the first skydive – all AFF skydives are practiced on the ground repeatedly until the student knows the jump inside and out. He constantly had problems with the dive flow.  The first jump is technically very easy – for the instructors. We simply hang on; one hand gripping the student’s leg strap, the other one gripping the arm of the student’s jump suit. Once this formation is out the door and stable we can let go of the arm to throw hand signals in the student’s face.  So my husband and I are the instructors on this jump. I am very comfortable when doing an AFF jump with him because he has a great deal more experience than I have. On this particular jump, he was on the left side of the student, I was on the right. The instructor on the left is closest to the reserve parachute handle; the instructor on the right is closest to the main parachute handle.  The exit is not so great but we wrestled the poor man into position. His arch was completely messed up. He had his arms and knees down, like he was crouching on the floor on all fours. I let go of his arm to give him an arch signal bit I immediately had to retake my grip because he would have flipped over. My husband was having similar problems, but he was able to position himself in such a way that he could throw signals.   Surprisingly, at the bottom of the skydive, this man was aware enough to pull for himself. My job as the main side jumpmaster is to pull the main handle if the student doesn’t. Once the handle is pulled (and in this case, the handle is a small pilot chute, which is thrown into the air and pulls open the main parachute), I can’t do anything else so I release the student and book out of there.  The reserve side’s job is to assist the student should something go wrong at that moment in time. The student is literally ripped out of his hands once the parachute starts opening.  We saw it on video afterwards. I saw the pilot chute extracted; I left. The student didn’t let it go right away, and he tilted on his side. Finally he lets go, has a horrible opening, but it does open.  Just not all the way.  When I leave, I wait a few seconds then open my own parachute. Once it’s open, I look for the student to make sure everything is okay. I don’t see him. I do a slow circle, then I see him   below  me.  A student should be open by 4500 feet. I normally open at 3500 -2500 feet. See the problem?  I get closer to him and I realize his parachute is only partially inflated; I can’t make out why. This problem explains the altitude discrepancy; he doesn’t have the square footage overhead to slow him all the way down.  He seems to be struggling with something but I can’t tell. I’m yelling ‘cut away!’ at the top of my voice but he has to be a good 500 feet off. Finally, to my relief, at about 1500 feet above the ground, he does get rid of his malfunctioning main canopy and open his reserve.  I am still above him and getting closer, and I notice something strange. He is flying backwards!  I get close enough to see the lines of his parachute: he has line twists. If you have ever sat in a swing then twisted yourself around, you get out of line twists the same way. He never tries to kick out of them.  He is thankfully not trying to steer, but he is not trying anything else, either. He is headed past the drop zone, past all of the nice, flat pasture that makes up the northern end of the airport, and obliviously heading towards a ravine and trees. Me? I’m finally getting lower than him and have to all of a sudden decide where I’m going to land.  I figured I could follow his path of flight to the ground, but I decided screw that. If I busted my head I wasn’t going to do him any good anyhow. I landed in a fenced-in cow pasture and by the time I got my helmet off, he had gone behind some trees.  I only lost visual contact with him for about 3 minutes. Those were 3 long minutes. I remember what was going through my mind at the time: “Oh, god what if he’s dead? Oh shit please don’t let me have a dead student oh damn this sucks –bunny!- oh shit oh no….”  I’m serious; I’m gathering up my parachute and making a beeline for a gate when all of a sudden a huge fluffy bunny rabbit jumps past me. Okay, so I’m easily distracted.  One thing I like about Cullman, Alabama; whenever people have landed off the drop zone the local residents have been great about getting us home. A couple of nice guys in a pickup helped me over the fence and helped me find my student.  He had a scraped nose, but other than that he was fine.

      Saturday was nice - overcast but at a high altitude; high enough to jump. After three weeks of no jumping it was nice to get my knees in the breeze. I only did 2 jumps then I had to go to Lowe's to get some deadbolts: one of our employees decided to steal from us.  We feel betrayed - this kid was a hard worker but managed to get a hold of some keys to the drop zone and broke in Tuesday night and stole our Playstation II. My husband found the keys in the kid's car and with the help of one of Cullman's Finest, confronted him with it. Turns out he's been using the keys to help himself to the beer fridge, as well. A VCR is missing from the airport's FBO. (fixed base of operations), as well.  What a stupid kid. He had a good thing going - everybody liked him and we paid him well. One time he had a problem with his car and we passed the hat at the D.Z. to help him get it fixed.  Everyone out there take note: do not shit where you eat.  We woke up Sunday to pouring rain so I came home and finished  The Dam Busters . The copy I had was atrocious, but it was not censored. I had a case of the uncomfortable giggles, but after a few scenes with the badly-named Labrador, I had no problem bleeping over the offending name. You know, if I have to put up with  Will Smith and Martin Lawrence  referring to everyone and their uncle Bob by that term of endearment I don't know why everyone gets all uptight about a bunch of English men using the phrase. *Sigh* I know it all has to do with 'context'.  The movie, by the way, is fantastic. The special effects are not great, but the movie was made in 1954. And anybody who has sat through the original 'Star Wars' will thrill to a bunch of scenes that Lucas ripped off for the bombing run on the Death Star.  I would love to see it get remade. As for the poor choice of pet names, any modern-day screenwriter could successfully leave the dog sub-plot out of the movie and only hard-core purists would object. Just keep Micheal Bay away from it, please.

      Another week of pain finished. Too bad; I’m adding a fourth workout day Monday.  Shoulders and legs day: Cardio was a bitch because I forgot my Albuterol (for athsma) before I climbed on the treadmill.  Shoulders:  Military Press 50lbs 10X3, Shoulder Flyes 8 lbs 12X3, Shoulder Rows 50 lbs 10X3 Legs: Squat: 65 lbs 14X3, Stiff-Legged Deadlift 65 lbs 14X3, Seated Calf Raises 45lb 10X3  Ooh! A guy at the gym, a hardcore lifter, complimented me on my squat form. Made my day! No, he was not hitting on me because my husband was right there.  Whew. I was exhausted after this workout. I think it is primarily because we worked out the day before; it could also have been the Buffalo wings and beer bust Jon and I had last night.  Every once in a while I fry up a batch o wings and we tear through them accompanied by a six pack. We rationalize that it’s legal because it’s low-carb beer.  Not only is it good for stress, it’s good for roto-rootering your system which is good for you if you’re on a low-carb diet and want to stay away from laxatives.  That was probably WTMI.  We also watch a movie and last night’s feature was  Down With Love  with Renee Zellweger and Ewan “Free Willy” MacGregor.  The bad news is Ewan doesn’t free his willy, but he does have his normal accent (yay!) with the exception of a few times where he deliberately uses a really awful southern accent.  The movie is a riff on 60’s comedies, resplendent with the fashion senses from Hell, shellacked hairdo’s (we are talking Devo-style), and an annoying constant soundtrack. Zellweger and MacGregor have a battle of the sexes and because I saw some of those movies I knew they’d fall in love.  It was okay; had some funny moments; and if you didn’t get enough of Ewan’s singing in  Moulin Rouge  stick around for the credits.  Speaking of Ewan I had a couple of random thoughts while watching this movie:   1)	If he isn’t careful he’ll be developing love handles soon. 2)	I like him better as a blonde. 3)	He has an evil smile. Which I like. 4)	Does he really have chest hair or is that a hairpiece? 5)	If it is chest hair, my god, they dyed it too.  Jon made a comment after listening to his accent – he thinks MacGregor would make an excellent James Bond.   I almost spewed my beer, and then I thought about how much money I would pay to hear him say, “Bond. James Bond”.  Another tangent: I genuinely liked  The Bourne Identity .  Why? Because it wasn’t filled with big stunts or pyrotechnics. The action was more reasonable (within the context of spy/adventure movies). Plus Matt Damon is as cute as a button. And it had Chris Cooper. Speaking of, I loved  Lone Star .

      Hooray! I ran 2 miles in 20 minutes at the gym today. I recovered pretty quickly, too. Back and Biceps today; everything at 3 sets of 10 reps: Back: Lat Pulldown 80 lbs, Machine row 70 lbs, Back Flyes 10 lbs. Biceps: Preacher EZ Curl 50 lbs, barbell curl 50 lbs. I also did wrist curls w/ 8 pound dumbbells; 4 sets of 15.  I hinted that I was a Dungeons and Dragons geek when I was younger. Indeed, I played fairly constantly from the ages of 16 to 32. I spent a great deal of that time being a dungeon master. I truly hated that term.   Some of my players were all for calling me ‘dungeon mistress’, but I nixed that. ‘DM’ was just fine. I joked that Game Operations Director was acceptable, but I stole that idea from someone.  I was 32 when I started skydiving. My players got all upset when I sold all of my carefully hand-painted miniatures (I had about a thousand of them) to buy a new rig.  I still play but only on the computer:  Baldur’s Gate ,   Icewind Dale , and the new  Temple of Elemental Evil  are based on the actual Dungeons and Dragons rules. Many other games for Fantasy Role-Playing have been implemented and I have pretty much played them all.  I have played them all with the exception of Multi-User games, like  Ultima Online  or  Everquest .  I don’t have the time to spend 14 hours a day on line building up a character, like the adolescent boys who normally play these games do.   Sometimes I miss real gaming – in other words spending Friday night at someone’s house, maybe for 6 to 10 hours, bullshitting, drinking Coke, eating pizza and Doritos, and rolling dice to kill monsters.  That will teach me to get a life.   The all-time computer game that chewed up most of my time was   Civilization II , a turn-based strategy game where you took a stone-age village into a civilization capable of colonizing space. You had to get brutal on your (computer A.I.) opponents though or they would stomp all over you. There is nothing like going to war with Mahatma Gandhi or Eleanor Roosevelt because you didn’t want to fork over some hard-gained tech to him or her. Power-hungry bastards.  I played  Civ II  so much I gave the cd to a friend to hide from me. After three months, he gave it back and I went right back to playing from the moment I got home from work to whenever I got tired.

      Jon and I watched  Starship Troopers  last night. This silly movie has an unreasonably high entertainment value to me for some reason. It would have been better if the people who made the movie hadn’t tried to hammer the fascist elements of the story over our heads. Heinlein would have been perturbed.  Nonetheless, any movie with both Michael Ironsides and Clancy Brown can’t be all bad.  We didn’t go to the gym this morning; Jon wanted to sleep in. Again, I was slightly irritated with a change in routine, but then I went and slept for another 2 hours.  My dieting has stalled out; I will wait until the weekend to see if I remain stalled. If I do, I will do something no one recommends – a 24 hour fast. For some reason it helps me, and I only do it on a rare occasion.  I have found a new favorite TV show:   Good Eats  on the Food Network. The host, Alton Brown, has a funny, breezy style (and is it just me, or does he look like Thomas Dolby’s slightly more stable younger brother?). Instead of the normal cooking show formula of “This is what we’re cooking today here are the ingredients mix them this way voila!” Brown always goes into the history and philosophy of what he’s cooking. He had one show dedicated to the perfect Macaroni and Cheese dish. Hell, I enjoyed a recent show on nothing but Butternut frosting.  He is not a purist; if frozen vegetables work for a dish Brown is not afraid to say so. He is more likely to visit a hardware store for a specific kitchen tool as a specialty shop. He freely admits that a cake from a store-bought mix is tastier and moister than what you can whip up in the kitchen from scratch. I draw the line at putting store-bought ice cubes in brewing wort, but if it works for him, I won’t knock it.  I can’t help but like a man who has flames painted on his KitchenAid mixer.

      For some reason my husband wanted to do chest and triceps today at the gym. Any change in routine always upsets me until I think about it. It’s no big deal.  I ran a bit better – 1.96 miles in 20 minutes.   I increased weight on everything and am doing 3 sets of 10 reps: Bench Press – 80 lbs, decline dumbbell press – 20 lbs,  chest fly – 10 lbs. Assisted Dip w/ 60lbs assistance, tricep pulldown 45 lbs, tricep Flat bar pulldown 60 lbs.  Jon and I closed on a new house in Hartselle Friday afternoon. We will move at the end of the month. I just want it to be over with!  I read up more on INTP’s. Here are some amusing excerpts:   Indeed, most primary interests of an INTP are things which he cannot fully understand, usually because they are highly complex or have some exotic, mystical element that does not yield to analysis. This is the real reason why INTPs are drawn to complexity: anything simple is too quickly understood and cannot hold the fascination for long.   Yep, that’s me. Thoroughly explore something nifty then move on.    INTPs hate to think of themselves being in any way inadequate, at least in areas that are important to them. So, as soon as he puts himself behind some task, then he must achieve competency. But that is as far as it goes.   Guilty as charged.    INTP's put great weight on being individuals and essentially different from other people, who they often view as being too alike and too interdependent.   Mea culpa.   All opinions must get filtered through an analysis procedure to test for viability. No title or claim of being an "expert" carries any weight with an INTP. All people, big or small, are subject to an identical scrutiny. The INTP sees himself as the independent arbiter, whether a fair claim or not. However, when someone has proved his credentials through having sensible opinions, he will be afforded great respect by the INTP. Most respected of all are those who are not only sensible but also innovative. Intelligence is above all highly prized.   Mea maxima culpa.   Independence, derived primarily from strongly introverted Thinking, leads to perhaps the most difficult aspect (for others) of the INTP, namely stubbornness.    Ha ha ha ha! Just ask my husband.   The preference for intuitive perception means that INTPs dislike having their lives planned. They feel a distinct unease before most fixed appointments and cannot fully relax until the scheduled event is over, or at least in progress.    Sheesh!   I feel like someone pegged me to a wall. Some aspects of this analysis ring more strongly than others, but it more or less is accurate.  Anyhow. I didn’t watch anything special yesterday; Jon and I finished watching the Sci-Fi Network production of  Dune . Well, it was better than David Lynch’s fiasco, but even in the miniseries format too much information was glossed over. I spent way too much time explaining things to Jon and I only knew them because I read the book 20 times when I was a kid.  I didn’t much like the lead. I don’t remember Paul Atreides being such a whiny jerk. I may need to reread the book. At least he didn’t have Kyle McLachlan’s 80’s hair.  I kind of miss the loopyness of Lynch’s epic. The very nature of the story provided some cheesy goodness, but this new version just wasn’t as entertaining. I’m sure I’m not the only one during the fight between Paul and Feyd Harkonnen who shouted out “I  WILL  kill him!” at the top of my lungs.  Hell. And I enjoyed the hell out of the SciFi network’s  Battlestar Galactica  remake.  Ooh! My brother lent me his copy of  The Gamers , a short low-budget film suitable only for people who spent their Friday nights in the dorms rolling dice with their buddies.  I am sorry to say I laughed my ass off. Highly recommended to any Dungeons and Dragons geek; all other avoid.  The Dead Gentlemen are now producing a full length film :  The Gamers, 2nd Edition . Argh!

      My friend's blog had a listing of some of those on-line personality quizes. I took the Myers-Briggs Personality test again; this time I scored  INTP  (Introverted Intuitive Thinking Perceptive).  I have to admit this description is fairly close - this passage especially: "INTPs and Logic -- One of the tipoffs that a person is an INTP is her obsession with logical correctness. Errors are not often due to poor logic -- apparent faux pas in reasoning are usually a result of overlooking details or of incorrect context. "   The Reason I Watch Movies, or, Why You Will Never Hear Me Slam  Jurassic Park :    The day  Jurassic Park  came out in the theaters, I was canned from my job. It was a joke of a job, doing returns in a warehouse, but I had never been fired before. I was let go because the company was losing money, not because I did a bad job, but it was a blow to my ego. So, when my brother and his friends called me up that Friday to go see JP, I was feeling rather shitty and tried to beg off. Fortunately, they dragged me along. And this is why I will never slam  Jurassic Park : from the start of the movie until the credits rolled, I NEVER ONCE thought about my problems. I did NOT think about money, jobs, or the fact that I cried in front of my boss. I came out of the theater happy.   Perhaps for me, the difference between "I liked it" and "I loved it" is how well the story holds up in my mind after the lights come back on; how well it stands up to the nitpicky part of me. People nitpicked JP especially about the characters, but as far as I was concerned, Steven Spielberg took characters who weren't well-defined in the first place and cast distinct, likeable (to me, anyway) actors to play the parts. The characters in  Jurassic Park  were good enough for me. I love  Jurassic Park .   Other than watching lots and lots of movies over the years, the only thing I have done above and beyond to learn about movies is read a textbook on "Narrative Film". I learned the difference between 'montage' and 'mise en scene'. Big deal.   My favorite movie:  Aliens    Please note, I did not say it was the best movie of all time! I'm not about to try to take a stab at guessing that. It is my favorite movie. Period. Seen it dozens of time.   Since we're kind of sort of on the subject of James Cameron, I adored  Terminator , liked  the Abyss  and  Terminator 2 , and I enjoyed  Titanic  when it was focusing on the disaster and not the hackneyed romance and 1-dimensional villains (although it was a joy to see David Warner again - where the hell have you been?).   The old insult, "there's no accounting for taste" is nonsense; if you dig deep enough, you can find out why you like what you like. A good example for me is the fact that I do not like country music. I will, however, listen to Patsy Kline. A friend of mine has a good singing voice. She has, over the years, recommended female singers for me to listen to. I remember her putting on an old tape of 'I fall to pieces', and I really listened to her voice for the first time. Doing so was important to my friend, so I obliged. Patsy Kline's voice is haunting. That experience stuck and is part of my 'taste' in music (most of which normally lies in the techno/industial arena).   So why do I mostly prefer mostly genre movies? Probably because I read way too much as a kid, and a great deal of it was Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury, as well as folks who wrote adventure stories like Robb White and Alistair MacLean. Yeah, but why did I read those?   Both my mom and dad are readers; and one of my earliest memories was my mom reading  The Lord of the Rings  to my sister and me when we were kids ( when I first saw the short trailer for the movies - just watching Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Frodo, Sam, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn and Boromir walk by was enough to put my heart in my throat). That event certainly accounts for a great deal of my attraction to genre stories.   I hate it when the characters are boring or poorly acted, or I am drawn in by the characters and possibilities in front of me then I notice a plot hole that jars me out of the experience. It's a slap in the face. I suppose that watching bad movies and yelling at the screen is the moral equivalent of slapping back (And a lot of fun!).  This post went nowhere. Eh.

      Saturday and Sunday are rest days, especially during the winter. Once the weather turns nicer I'm busy at the drop zone; especially now that I'm an instructor.  But it's winter here in the Southeast and it has rained this weekend so I have had a rare opportunity to goof off.  I watched a war movie from 1952 -  The Red Ball Express  which is about the truckers who kept General Patton's tanks and troops supplied with gasoline, ammo, and other neccessities.  The movie is formulaic: As the unit forms we find out that the Lieutenant and the First Sargeant have some bad blood between them stemming from an incident in their civilian lives. Geez, will they resolve this and become bestest of friends by the time the credits roll? We also have a likeable, wisecracking ne'er-do-well who falls in love with a saucy french blonde.   What is different about this movie is it features three Black soldiers (Sidney Poitier is one of them). I thought it was a little odd to have an integrated unit in a World War II movie; 1952 is a little early for political correctness (I am forever amused by  Force 10 from Navarrone  and how it managed to sneak Carl Weathers on the team).  As it turns out, most of the truckers on the real Red Ball Express were black; they were not used in combat units in World War II. So the movie cheats out by making most of them white but I think context is important when trying to make some kind of moral judgement on this movie. At least they had some blacks and did try to bring up something of the uneasiness at the integration. This movie could have been a lot more whitewashed than it was.  The formula stuff got to me, though. In an amused way.  Speaking of context, I am in the middle of watching  The Dam Busters  a british movie about the development of bouncing bombs. I will refer you to Liz Kingsley's review for more  information  about what I mean about context. One of the officers in the movie has a pet dog which he named Nigger. In context, this was not a malicious slur. More modern audiences have a tough time handling this hence it is tough to get an uncensored copy of this movie, or even find one.  I would say instead of censoring it, if the distributors have a tough time with it, why not put a post script explaining the context? Pretending it never happened doesn't mean it didn't.   Read Liz's review, anyway. She does a fantastic job of detailing the difference between British and American World War II movies.  And speaking of,  The Battle of Britain  is next on my queue. The cast alone is enough to get me excited.

         Why did I start skydiving? I'll try to refrain from too much bullshit. I have always been jealous that men get to do all these cool things and I couldn't. Well that *is* bullshit because ultimately I can do what I want (I just better be prepared to pay for it). I dated a man in who was airborne-qualified and I saw his army unit jump once. That jealousy thing kicked in - he got to jump out of planes and run around in the woods and camp out and shit. Anyway, the opportunity to try a jump came up much later in life (12 years later) and I did it. Scared the hell out of me until I got out the door - then the only word I can use is euphoric. I was doing it! I was stable and falling through the air at 120 miles an hour - my jumpmasters were beside me, smiling and nodding as I got through the skydive. Then I opened my parachute and sailed to the ground. I knew I would have to do it again. The second time I did it I was hooked. Here was something I could do finally that was fairly unique, here was something I did that took bravery.   And skydivers (as much as I complain about them) are pretty simplistic about their rules - if you skydive, welcome to the club. I am shy but I have always had an easier time of going to a drop zone and meeting people ( the 7:1 ratio of men to women probably doesn't hurt, either). I met my husband about 3 months after I started skydiving.   A side note - That jealousy thing is a sore spot and something I'm embarrassed about. I know the truth - the truth is society can give you shit about something but it can't really stop you from doing what you want. I am my limits.   What I like about skydiving: I do like the people - I was once on a 4-way skydive and realized I was in the air with a fireman, an astronaut, and a chicken farmer. Nothing matters except we all like leaving airplanes in mid-flight. I like the freedom - we don't get out there and flail about -all of our movements are controlled and we can do what we want (with a little practice). With this ultimate freedom comes the ultimate responsibility- we can never forget that there's a planet coming toward us at about 120 miles an hour. But then comes the other fun thing about skydiving: the canopy ride.   Modern-day parachutes are more like airfoils than umbrellas. I find the canopy ride relaxing, and I have seen some incredible sights suspended under a canopy 1000 feet in the air. An incoming thunderstorm, for one. It was a ways off, but I could see it moving and the lightning flashing underneath the thunderhead and the rain patterns between the clouds and the ground. From the ground a thunderstorm is clouds and rain and noise. From the air it is a majestic, malevolent entity. I often see nearby hawks soaring on thermals, hunting for lunch. Seeing a sunset on the last load of the day. Getting near to a cloud and feeling that rare sense of movement that you only get when you are close to the ground. Getting over a cloud and landing on and going through my shadow.   I'll bitch about skydiving a lot. Once I get out the door I remember why I do it.

      Friday is shoulder and legs day.   First off, I ran 1.92 miles in 20 minutes. Yes, I do cardio before I weight lift, even on leg days. I’m well aware I could probably do more weight if I didn’t, but I don’t so I’m not. So there.  Again, the sets are 3 sets of 12 reps. Shoulders: Seated Military Press at 45 lbs, Shoulder Fly at 8 lbs, and Flat Bar Shoulder Row at 45 lbs.  Legs: Squat at 65 lbs, Stiff-legged Deadlift at 75 lbs, and seated calf raises at 40 lbs.  By the end of the squat sets I’m grunting like a wounded seal. I hope everyone in the gym appreciates it.  I’m on a war movie kick of all things. I watched  Too Late the Hero  last night, with Cliff Robertson and Michael Caine. It also featured Denholm Elliot and Takakura Ken, who were both nice surprises.   The movie was okay and a little ahead of its time. It was a cynical movie about World War II; about as out of place as  The Green Berets  was (a Vietnam War movie with patriotic, gung-ho attitudes).  Robertson plays an American Navy Lieutenant sent to a small Pacific Island to assist a small English military outpost. A group of the English soldiers have been tasked to trek all the way to the northern end of their island where a small Japanese observation outpost exists and blow up their transmitter so that the Japanese can’t inform their high command of an American Navy convoy that will be passing by in a few days. Someone who speaks Japanese is to tag along so they can make a fake transmission before destroying the transmitter to buy the convoy more time. That’s where Robertson fits in.  Sounds contrived? I think so. If there’s a small outpost on an island, why not just bomb the crap out if it? One of the actors tagged to be Exposition Boy had explained there were no natives on the island (as if that mattered).  Robertson’s Lieutenant doesn’t want to do the mission any more than the English assigned to do it. All of the English were lousy soldiers. The Japanese come off as more humane and enlightened, which amused me about a movie made in 1970.  Watch this one only if you are bored on a Sunday afternoon.

      What the hell is a DZO?  Drop Zone Owner.  What the hell is a Drop Zone?  It's a place, usually an airport or an airstrip, where people pay to jump out of airplanes. It has a different connotation in the military.   I've been skydiving for over 7 years and I have 926 jumps. My husband and I opened a DZ in the southeast about 4 years ago. I wasn't enthusiastic about the idea; there's an age-old joke in the skydiving community: How do you make a small fortune in skydiving? Start with a large fortune and open a drop zone.   Oh, my sides. Here's another skydiving joke for you (bad language ahoy!): A guy had gone to do his first jump one day and was telling a friend about it afterwards. "Yeah, I was real nervous", he said, "The jumpmaster told me to climb out and I told him no. So he told me again to climb out and I said, 'no'. He then got all in my face and said 'Goddammit, if you don't climb out I'm going to fuck you up the ass!'"  His friend said, "So, did you jump?"  "A little, at first."   Oh, my sides!  Anyway, what I kind of hoped would peter out has turned from a Cessna operation (a Cessna is an airplane that holds 4 skydivers) to a King Air (holds 12 -14).   So, do we make our living off of the drop zone? HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!! Oh, sorry. No, my husband runs the dz full time but I have a day job. I am a software analyst (A software analyst does what a developer does, but doesn't get paid as much). I'm not really gritching, the company I work for hired me even though my degree is in Anthropology (you want fries with that?).  As a dzo, the worst thing I can think of is to have someone die. You know what? It's going to happen. Most non-skydivers think that we are playing a wierd game of Russian Roulette. The truth is people get injured or die skydiving for the same reason people get injured or die doing anything, especially anything high-risk: they fail to follow proper procedure. Or, if an emergency situation occurs, they fail to follow proper emergency procedures. Anybody can greatly reduce (but not eliminate) their risks of injury or death by knowing and practicing proper procedures.   Have I seen people get hurt? Yes. We had one injury last year and we thought we were going to lose him. He landed on his head, on the tarmac. He's alive, and he might get to the point where he can have a normal life. God, I hope so. He's a good guy.   Have I seen anybody die? No, and I hope I never will. Do I know anybody who has died? Two. One was a bit of a spaz, a good kid who for some reason only known to him, walked into the spinning prop of an airplane. Another *dove* into the spinning prop of an airplane. You know, there aren't that many Cuisinart deaths in skydiving. They are intensely rare as compared to hook-turn/low turn deaths. Just one of those statistical anomalies.     Once upon a time, skydivers used modified surplus military equipment. Thanks to the Great God Bill Booth and some other innovators, modern skydiving equipment is safer and more reliable and deaths due to malfunctioning equipment have decreased dramatically. Most skydivers nowadays die under perfectly good canopies (one way you can tell a skydiver from a whuffo. We call parachutes canopies) because they make some radical turn too close to the ground and they smack into the dirt. Some do it deliberately (a hook-turn. It looks kewl), some do it because they panic and are trying to avoid landing down-wind or to avoid an obstacle. Some just jump canopies that are too small for their skill level. The latter reason has put three or four people in the hospital at our drop zone. We're tired of it so now we have to play safety nazi on the people who jump because they are too fucking stupid to realize that jumping a handkerchief can kill them.   Hey, it's my blog and I'll vent if I want to.   Oh, yeah; whuffo: a non-skydiver. Someone who says "whuffo you jump outta that aeroplane?"   I realize I made it sound bad. Most skydiving injuries involve a busted limb. It happened to me - I came in for a landing on a bumpy day, knew I was going to have a hard landing, and instead of keeping my feet and knees together, I pulled my feet up underneath me and literally sat on my ankle. I heard a crunching noise and I had two thoughts: "Oh, shit, I broke it!" and "I'm never gonna hear the end of this at work!"   It turned out to be a sprain and I was jumping again in two weeks. As for work, a co-worker had been thrown from her horse and punctured a lung that same weekend so that took the heat off me.   There's a proper procedure for landing and everyone is taught it. People bust things because they fail to do a proper Parachute Landing Fall. What am I getting at? When people die/get hurt in skydiving, it's their fault 99.9% of the time. The woman who died diving into a prop - it wasn't her fault.   Do you feel like skydiving now? You either want to or you don't - nothing I write here is going to sway you one way or the other. Just do yourself a favor - if you are a skydiver and/or you feel like opening a drop zone, for the love of God, man! Are you out of your mind?

      Thursday are rest days for me. I clocked in at 130 pounds this morning and that makes me happy. That means I'm not too far from where I left off when the Holiday Madness started (129.5). My goal for January is 128.  Rest days, incidentally, are as least as important as weight training and eating right. You will not make gains if you do not train and you will not make gains if you do not get enough rest between training sessions.  misc.fitness.weights , one of the few groups I read constantly, always seems to have a thread about some yo-yo who trains 7 days a week and doesn't understand why he or she feels beat all the time and can't lift as much as he or she used to.  I'm not as big into scuba diving as some things, but if I could move to the Caribbean I'm sure I would dive a hell of a lot more.  Jon and I learned to scuba dive only because we were going on vacation to  St. John  in the U.S Virgin Islands. I would gladly trade skydiving for scuba diving if I could dive in waters that clear and warm, and teeming with cool critters, every day.  Unfortunately Northern Alabama only has a few rock quarries for dive spots.   I used to live in the Caribbean; specifically Isla Verde in Puerto Rico. My family lived there from 1967 - 1977. I was very young and as usual, youth is wasted on children. I did not appreciate that I literally had a beach for a back yard.  Two years ago Jon and I got out of credit card debt and paid off our cars. We started saving up all the money we all of a sudden weren't spending and decided to celebrate by going on a real vacation. I chose St. John because I remembered going there several times when I was younger. I remember I loved it.  How the hell did people plan vacations before the web? We picked out a villa to rent and lucked into a really nice one called  French Cap . Villa rentals are the way to go as far as we're concerned. Hotels suck and are only options when you are trying to save money. For that matter, you will not save money if you stay at the Westin or Caneel Bay, the big hotels on the island. You can save at some of the smaller guesthouses, especially the ones in town, because you will not have to rent a jeep. All the good beaches are on the north shore and available by taxi.  We did have to rent a jeep because St. John is hilly. Actually it's one big hill. Our villa was a 10 minute drive out of town. The cars have the steering on the left and everyone drives on the left like they were British or something. Driving is not as intimidating as it sounds once you get used to it. Besides, it's almost impossible to drive over 30 miles an hour so even though the island is only something like 9 miles at its widest point, it still takes 30 minutes to drive from the west side to the east.  It is also almost impossible to find parking space in Cruz Bay. If you go, find a jeep rental place that will let you park in their lot.  St. John is a great place to go even if you don't scuba dive; I highly recommend at least learning how to snorkel. My favorite snorkeling spots are Cinnamon Bay, and Waterlemon Cay when the currents are not strong. On the recommendations of some friends, we dove with  Low-Key Watersports . We have enjoyed (that's too weak a word) diving with this outfit both times we have been to St. John.  The first time we visited one of our dives was the  R.M.S Rhone . I was worried at first because the first part of the dive was in 80 feet of water and Jon and I had just gotten our certification. When I entered the water I lost my regulator for a second because my jaw dropped. The water is so clear there that even in 80 feet I could clearly see the entire wreck on the bottom; I could see the groups of divers swimming around it.  On both trips and several dives (including the Rhone), Jon and I encountered Steve Simonsen, a photographer who lives on the island.  His site  has beautiful pictures plus some nifty wallpapers. While the boat was clearing customs (the Rhone is located in the British Virgin Islands), Steve kept all of us divers in thrall as he told us the story of the Rhone as well as the history of the pirates who used Tortola as their lair.  You could say my passion isn't scuba diving, but St. John.

      Today at the gym: Chest and triceps. Again, these exercises are at 12 reps 3 sets: Bench Press 80lbs, Dumbell press 20lbs, chest flyes 8lbs. I do dips on the Gravitron machine, a nifty gadget that has counterweights so girly girls like me can do dips and chin-ups. I did 3 sets of 12 dips with 70lbs of help. Then Tricep pulldowns on a cable machine at 40 pounds then tricep flatbar pulldowns on a cable machine at 55 pounds. I then did stiff-legged deadlifts with 95 pounds. Yikes, those were heavy. I need to ease off just a little (maybe just 80-85 pounds), do more reps, then work up. Really my form is good - I'm more worried about my grip. I don't like wrist wraps.  I ran a bit better: 1.87 miles in 20 minutes. My personal best is 2 miles in 19 minutes. I'd like to get 2 miles in 18 minutes - that would beat my best time in the military which was almost 20 years ago. Hey, with my athsma and stubby little legs I'm happy I can run at all.   Since I spent the majority of yesterday blathering about my movie watching habits, I'll spend today yammering about another of my interests.  My interests, by the way, are watching movies, cooking, weightlifting, skydiving, and scuba diving. Not neccessarily in that order. Today I choose cooking.   Top Ten Food Staples at My House    Boneless Skinless Chicken Thighs:   When the grocery store has these I stock up because it's a pain to bone and skin them myself. Chicken thigh meat tastes better than chicken breast and it's almost impossible to overcook. Sure it has a few more calories but big deal.   Tuna, Eggs, Cottage Cheese:   Yes, I should list these separately, but this is the holy trinity of the standard dieter. All are low in fat and high on protein. I bounce between these three all the time for breakfast/lunch foods. I do not use mayonnaise for Tuna, by the way. Mayo was invented by some French guy who wanted to see just how much oil he could whisk into a raw egg. It turns out to be quite a bit. Any ways, this sounds gross, but two tablespoons of Pace Medium Salsa added to a can of light tuna makes a tasty lunch for me.   Splenda:  The greatest culinary contribution from Canada since rapeseed oil (called "Canola Oil" because no one thought anyone would want to buy something called "Rapeseed Oil". Probably a good move). Splenda is the market name for Sucralose, a sugar substitute. I like it's taste a thousand times better than nutrasweet and a bazillion times better than saccharine. And unlike Nutrasweet, I can cook with it. I will also add to this category  DaVinci Syrups , who make syrups based on Sucralose. I'm especially addicted to their vanilla syrup which Wal-Mart carries. You can order from the ir site, just be aware they do carry sugar based syrups as well.   Paul Newman Dressings:  These dressings are consistently made with low carb counts, natural ingredients, AND he gives all his profits to charity. As close to guilt-free eating as you will ever get. I put these dressings on Romaine lettuce salads. Romaine just tastes better than Iceberg.   Butter:   Nothing beats the taste of real butter. Nothing! Most people don't realize this, but margarine only offers one benefit over butter: it's cheaper. It's not healthier, it's not lower in calories, and it certainly doesn't taste better.   Cheese:   In the whirlwind of arguments pro and con about the various diets, when the dust clears and only truth remains on the battlefield, I am on a low-carb diet because I can finally eat cheese again. In my house, Edam, Gouda, Cheddar and Pepper Jack are commonly found. I also buy mozarella string cheese for my husband. His favorite is Borden's.   Turkey Italian Sausage:   I don't know why, but these have become a favorite. A few sausage links, a cup of cooked spaghetti squash, and Alfredo sauce. Yum!   Hodgson Mill Oat Bran:   It's what's for breakfast on Gym days. I mentioned I was doing a Targeted Ketogenic Diet. This diet is simply eating a few more carbs before working out. It helps increase my endurance some. Oat bran also has plenty of fiber; getting enough is always a problem on a ketogenic diet. Cook some up - add a pat of butter and a packet of splenda.   Other meats:   Including pork chops, ribeye steaks, chicken leg quarters, corned beef, and whatever I can grab on sale. This leads to:   A varied spice rack:   I have said it before and I'll say it again. Other spices exist apart from chili powder. Oregano, cumin, cayenne, and thyme get the biggest workout in my kitchen, as well as chili powder and curry powder. I also use cilantro, parsely, and basil which I buy fresh.    Garlic:  Hey! This is number 11! But how could I leave out garlic, the god of tasty foods and bad breath?  I should also list the most common vegetables: Romaine lettuce, zucchini, broccoli, sugar snap peas, celery, bell pepper and onion. My husband is not a big vegetable fan so I don't experiment with vegetables nearly as often as I'd like.  Out of everything here, this constitutes pretty much my entire diet. I keep trying to find new recipes, like yesterday I made tandoori chicken. Interesting spices for the tandoori: onion, garlic, cinnamon, allspice, cumin, and turmeric. Also a little cream, olive oil, and lemon juice. I tasted it after it was done and thought something was missing: I added some cayenne and it was dead-on. Mmmmmmmmmmm.  I should mention this: how ever did I get along before I bought a George Foreman grill?

      Ahg.   I believe in rewards - I bought Jon and me a six-pack of Michelob Ultra last night. 3 beers (okay, pseudo beer) is moderate. But a combo of the beer (dehydrating), a ketogenic diet (dehydrating), and the pseudoephedrine (dehydrating) I have been taking because of the lingering effects of a cold means I woke up with a hangover. Not bad but I still feel bleah.  I felt better after I got out of the gym - 20 minutes of cardio (running - at the top of my game I can run over 2 miles, but today I only did 1.8 ) and back and biceps. The back exercises are machine lat pulldowns (70 lb), Machine rows (60 lb), and dumbell back flyes (8 lbs).  Biceps are preacher EZ curls (45 lbs, assuming the EZ bar is 25 pounds. I need to find out) and flat bar curls (35 lbs, assuming the short bar (standard?) is 25 pounds). I got rid of one of the bicep exercises - with all the compound stuff I do I don't see the point - and now am doing dumbell wrist curls (8 lbs). The wrist curls help other exercises - I used to wear a brace on my left wrist due to tendonitis (a beer accident - brewing, not drinking go figure). I haven't had to wear it since the end of last summer.  All exercises, by the way, are 12 reps, 3 sets. Yep, I'm at the low weight high rep end of a periodization cycle. I'm doing a 14-15 week cycle and I should eventually be doing 3 sets of 4 reps at some ungodly weight levels (ungodly for me). The week before my birthday I want to test my 1 rep maxes on the big 3: Bench Press, Squat, and Deadlift.  Anything else to yammer about? I started writing again upon being inspired by my friend  Nancy's blog . She said she'd link to mine so I am returning the favor.  I'm listening to music at work - it seems to help me concentrate and get work done. I'm a software developer. I won't fill you in with the details - software development is as boring as it sounds, although it can be mentally stimulating and financially rewarding. I do have an unreasonable love of the movie  Office Space  like many cubicle denizens. I hinted around to many of my loved ones that I wanted a red Swingline stapler for Christmas, but no luck.   Top Ten Favorite Actors:   How do I judge how much I like an actor? By this formula: "Hey, X is in this movie. I gotta watch it!" Sexual attraction has little to do with it. Okay, that's not true for many of them. But all of them can act.   This list is not in any particular order.   Damian Lewis:  As you might have read, he is definitely my  du jour . As much as adore Major Winters in  Band of Brothers  and loathe Soames in  The Forsyte Saga , I finally realized I was having impure thoughts of him when I watched  Dreamcatcher  on Halloween.   Lord, that movie was not good, but I like it more than most people did. It was a waste of a good cast (Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, Timothy Olyphant, Tom Sizemore, Morgan Freeman); the cast was why I rented it in the first place. There is nothing special about Lewis' character - he plays a college history professor (and he plays it well! I think I had him for a few classes). There is good chemistry between him and Jane, Lee and Olyphant at the beginning of the movie. All four do a great job coming across as old friends. Too bad about the shit weasels. Lewis has great chemistry with just about anyone he works with - I loved the scenes between him and Ron Livingstone in  BoB .  	 One other thing - most British actors learn American accents to get more roles. I can't blame them but it's a shame they have to hide their true accents. Lewis, on the other hand, has a fantastic American accent and I actually prefer him as an American.   Jason Isaacs:  Another Brit. I first saw him in the not-so-good  Event Horizon  but I didn't really notice him until  Armageddon . *Heh*.  Armageddon  is indeed a bad movie, but it's a favorite bad movie. I almost love it as much as I love  The Swarm .  Armageddon  is another collection of wasted actors. Like Lewis, Isaacs could play opposite a cinder block and have great chemistry.    Ewan MacGregor:  Who knew Obi-wan Kenobi was so hot when he was young? MacGregor has a great smile, nice bod, and isn't afraid to display his tackle. God, I love the British! His American accent, unlike Lewis or Isaacs, is a little off. I haven't watched  Down With Love  yet so maybe he's worked on it.   Eric Bana:  Australian comedian - something of a body builder. I noticed him while watching  Black Hawk Down , a movie with a great deal of good actors including the aforementioned MacGregor and Isaacs. He as a convincing American accent. He has been in a limited amount of movies, including the highly recommended  Chopper  and the not-as-recommended but I still liked it  Hulk .    Christian Bale:  Welsh hottie, flawless American accent. I finally took notice when two separate friends whose movie instincts I trust urged me to rent  Equillibrium . I can't wait to see how he does a the new  Batman .I loved  American Psycho  too. God, that was funny! Like Bana, he's a bit of a bodybuilder. Both actors will manipulate their body shape to fit the role. Bana got fat for  Chopper ; Bale got intensely thin - we're talking Holocaust victim thin - for the as yet unreleased  The Machinist .    Bill Paxton:  I have been a fan of his since  Aliens , and developed a good-sized crush sometime after  Apollo 13 . His accent is of course flawless, because he's a Texan. Finally, I list an American! Since I've booted Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson off he has logged the longest running time on the list. Unlike Gibson or Ford, Paxton is still turning out movies worth watching. I enjoyed  Frailty . We'll see about  Thunderbirds  and  Club Dread  both of which I'll see but I'm kind of fearing.   Frances McDormand:  This woman is a goddess, dammit! Talk about underappreciated. I have always liked her, but she became a member of the list when she played Sheriff Marge Gunderson in  Fargo .   Michelle Yeoh:  Kicks ass! I want to be her when I grow up. If you haven't seen  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  why not? The scenes between her and Chow Yun-Fat are devastating. Her best Hong Kong work, as far as I'm concerned, is  Wing Chun .   Guy Pearce:  Another Australian. Hot, great American accent,  Memento  and  L.A. Confidential . May fall off the list because he's been MIA. I have not seen  The Hard Word  yet, though.   Ralph Fiennes:  Another Brit. Decent American accent. I can't remember what I saw him in first but I've loved him since  Quiz Show . He's at his most gorgeous in  The English Patient . He is second after Paxton for most time on the list. I still haven't seen some of his later projects, but I did like his turn as Francis Dolarhyde in  Red Dragon . I saw him in a stage production of  Hamlet  in London in 1995. I had myself a good laugh when I was researching Damian Lewis' career: he played Laertes. I do remember a severely redheaded actor in the cast.   Honorable Mention:  Gibson and Ford are gone and I haven't been able to trust Willem Dafoe in years (although  Spiderman  was a great start back in the right direction). I don't really have anyone else to list. But I also like Michelle Rodriguez and Luke Wilson. Oh, yeah! I really like Matt Damon. He has taken some chances which impresses me. I think there's so few American actors on the list because they don't take chances (Do you hear me Mr. Affleck? You're cute as a button but come on!).  I wouldn't kick Thomas Jane out of bed for eating crackers, but other than  *61  which was a damn fine baseball movie, he has a habit of choosing bad projects. He does decent work, but damn there's only so much punishment I can take. Pun very much intended.

      Let's see. At the end of November I weighed 131. How much do I weigh now?  131.  I'll just wuss out and say the Holidays got to me. Yeah, that's it. So what now? I still want to get my bodyfat percentage to 20%. I may have quit the diet, but I did not quit going to the gym. Except for 2 weeks when I had a buttload of time off and was too lazy to do anything.  One thing I did notice: I liked how I felt when I went 3 weeks without any alcohol. This might be WTMI but my sex drive came back. Note to myself: beer and sex don't mix. Funny, they did in college.  So what happened in December? Besides the holidays. Well, got to see the family of course. My sister got me the Wiseguy story arc on DVD with Kevin Spacey in it for a Christmas present. I loved that arc. I used to like Spacey, too. What the hell happened? I thought he'd rank up there with Bill Paxton and William Fichtner for best damn character actor but he took the Tommy Lee Jones route (just say 'no' to bad scripts, guys, especially if you're in the position to pick and choose!).  Sorry - I digress. Jon and I rented a 172 and flew into a Cobb County airport. General Aviation rules! One day I need to get my private pilot's license. We stayed at my brother's house and drove with him to my sister's on Christmas day. Andrea married a good guy. He's a hell of a cook, too. Anyway, mom and her husband were there, with 2 sets of his relations, and old friends Hector and Victor (Hector has lost weight!). Spent a good amount of time discussing weightlifting with them. We watched Bad Boys II which sucked. Michael Bay needs to be guilliotined. Or at least pilloried.   The New Year's party at the drop zone was a blast. I drank too much. My friend Jeff did his thousandth jump. He got pied for it - old skydiver tradition. I have 926 jumps. I want my thousand before my 40th birthday (May 17th of this year) I bet I can do it barring a catastrophe or a busted ankle.  I have started with stiff-legged deadlifts at the gym. I'm doing three sets of 12 reps at 85 pounds. Man I can feel that in my glutes big time. It's a nice complement to squats, which I feel mainly in my quads. I'm still shying away from heavy loads - ironically I can bench more than I squat (my max on the bench press is about 100 pounds). As for the deadlifts - like a lot of people the weight I can handle is limited more by my grip than my glutes. Time to add a Farmer's walk to the mix.  Anyway, I'm back on the wagon and back on the plan. I read a great book on Ketogenic diets called 'The Ketogenic Diet' by Lyle MacDonald. It's available at his website  Body Recomposition .  What I've watched: Finished the Sopranos. I'm so glad Carmella finally threw the cheating bastard out! Finally someone I can cheer for.I've also finished the first 3 seasons of Angel (thank you, TNT). I don't like it as much as Buffy the Vampire Slayer, but it has its moments. Favorite: Lorne.  I finished the Forsyte Saga (part 1): Bossinney (the ninny) died in a carriage accident, Irene left Soames (which made me like her a lot more than I did), Soames is still a creep, but after some time (and a good deal of stalking) he finally divorced Irene and got involved with a woman who would tolerate having his child. It took a damn long time, but I finally felt something for Soames when he cried while bonding with his baby daughter.  The End.  Part 2 will air on PBS later on in February. Part 2 has (or so I have heard) Soames' grown-up daughter falling in love with young Jolyon Forsyte (Soames' cousin) and Irene's son (she had him near the end of part one). Hm. Second cousins. And people make fun of us folks in Alabama.  PBS is showing part 1 again right now so I set TiVO up to record it. TiVO is nifty - I can set it up to record things by actors so it is currently set up to record anything Damian Lewis, Christian Bale, Eric Bana, Ewan MacGregor, and Jason Isaacs is in. Of course it's not very discriminating so I accidentally caught part of Sweet November and nearly had to claw my eyes out when I saw Isaacs in drag. Jason I love you but you were just not made to wear dresses.  I saw Return of the King, of course. Loved it. The movie that affected me the most recently was 24 Hour Party People - loosely based on Tony Wilson, Factory Records, and the Manchester music scene from the late 70's to the early 90's.  I rented it because I owned quite a few Factory records back in the days of vinyl, and I was wondering what kind of mention they would give to one of my favorite bands: Joy Division. To my surprise and wonderment, they had a big chunk of the movie. The fellow who played Ian Curtis did a bang-up job - got the epileptic robot dance style down and everything. This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but I was in tears by the end of it. Era gone by, and all that. I have put some more Michael Winterbottom (director) movies on my Netflix queue.  I was also very sad because I had not known that Martin Hannett had died. He was very much a genius music producer. He was played in the movie by Andy Serkis (Gollum in Lord of the Rings).  I worship Michelle Yeoh as a Goddess; I saw 'Yes Madam' last night and it pissed me off. It also had Cynthia Rothrock in it -with that cast you would expect a lot of asskicking but nooooo. Most of the movie centered on these three thieves who bumbled around a lot. Dammit, if Michelle Yeoh is in a movie, I expect someone's ass to be kicked at least once every 10  minutes! It came across as a comedy, but the only thing that made me laugh were the 80's clothes and hairstyles. Rent Wing Chun instead.

      I got up and ran around Sparkman Park a couple of times.  It was a nice changeup from the treadmill even though it's still too cold.  Below is a trip report I wrote up from our last trip to St. John. I doubt we'll go this year, but I'm all ready jonesing to go back.  19 Oct 03  Got up at 4, left the house at 4:30. Getting through security at Huntsville International was a breeze - beat the hell out of going through Atlanta which we did last year to save a few bucks.   The flight from Atlanta to Charlotte Amalie was uneventful. Landing, getting our luggage, taxi to Red Hook, all without incident. Jon retrieved the Jeep while I sat on the Cruz Bay dock with a silly grin on my face. I was so glad to be back. It was a dark blue 4-cylinder Wrangler with 18,000 miles on it. I had to listen to Jon again grouse about how much better his jeep at home was.   We drove to Moonsong; it wasn't too far from where we stayed the year before (French Cap). We met a nice woman whose name I have forgotten who works for the rental company who gave us the rundown. It's a pretty villa with a nice view of Hart's Bay except for some power lines.   I could also hear some construction but it's in the background; not loud or annoying at all.   Jon and I agreed; Moonsong is no French Cap. One advantage that Moonsong had, however, is it comes with its own cat. Leo is a sweet little orange fellow who knows a pair of suckers -er, cat lovers, when he sees them. We spoiled him rotten. Tip to future guests: Leo is all for leftover scallops.   20 Oct   We drove into town to finish up paperwork on the Jeep. St. John car rental folks are very nice. Depending on who was working that day, sometimes we could park there, sometimes we couldn't. If someone could figure out a way to make a multi-storied garage in downtown Cruz Bay he would be a billionaire in a year.   Anyway, we went to Low-Key Watersports next to plonk some cash down for scuba diving. We dived with them last year and had a great time. We arranged for our first dive (the 21st), then drove out to Trunk Bay, a place we missed last year.   The beach is indeed beautiful, but the snorkeling, even with the trail, was somewhat disappointing. But dang, it felt so good to be in the warm Caribbean water. I can see why  cruise ship folks are taken there for Snorkeling 101. It is calm, and it did have plenty of fish and coral.   We spent the rest of the day unwinding, after a trip to Starfish to stock up on food. We went  to Rumbalaya for dinner - I had the shrimp parmigania and plenty of Amstel Light. I loved the food because they didn't overcook the shrimp.   21 Oct   It rained last night, but the interior of the Jeep is magically dry. In the early morning, we had no trouble spotting St. Croix off in the distance from the deck.   We did our first dive with Low-Key: the first spot was Calf Rock. It wasn't a tough dive; a nice ease back into scuba diving after a long layoff. The only place to dive near Huntsville  is a rock quarry; we use it only to stay current. Calf rock had lots of typical Blue Tang and Parrotfish.   One spiffy note: some of the Low-Key people remembered my husband and I from the year before.   They let us go off on our own on the second dive (Little St. James) which was nice because when you're with a big group you can run into each other a lot, but on the other hand my husband likes to scuba like he's trying to set a speed record.   Steve Simonsen, the photographer, was aboard. He was one of the people who remembered us. He is a very nice man who has a knack for storytelling. He and my husband talked shop - Jon is a skydiving videographer so they were comparing camera equipment and contrasting trying to get a good picture in their respective environments.   Chicken wings and Amstel light at the Beach Bar for lunch.   We took the ferry to Charlotte Amalie in the afternoon to look for a charger for the digital  camera. We skipped out on the shopping experience last year; I'm glad. I thought I was going to be kidnapped by some of those salespeople.   Ribeyes on the grill, accompanied by steamed rice and salad for dinner. I had Sam Adams for a changeup. The kitchen in Moonsong is decent sized, but somewhat underequipped. I tried to stay up for the World Series, but I was pooped.   22 Oct   Today we went to what is probably my favorite place in the known universe: Cinnamon Bay. The snorkeling is much better there. We saw a ray right off.   We went on our first night dive tonight; for some reason my mask kept filling with water until I figured out how to keep my nose pinched. Embarrasing. There were 4 of us; our guide was a nice young fella named Travis. Tip him well if you ever dive with him.   I saw a squid on that dive - oh, yeah. This was Stephen's Cay. Lots of critters come out at night; Travis had us stand on the sand and turn our lights out to view the glowy critters.   We ate at the Beach Bar again - fish and chips, and Amstel light. Jon invited over the other 2 divers who went with us; a woman and her dad from California (that plane trip must have sucked) who were staying at the Maho Bay camps. I remember looking around the bar - no young beautiful people; just us ordinairy schlubs having a good time in paradise.   23 Oct   Man, I'm writing a novel. I'll try and speed this up:   Today is goof-off day.I slept late and read something forgettable. Hell, even Jon read a book and he never reads for pleasure. Later that afternoon, he drove to the dock to pick up two of his friends that were joining us. I sat in the hot tub (which was not hot - I didn't want it to be), drank some beer, and finished my book while waiting for them.   2 people in Moonsong is just fine. 4 adults is way cramped.   24 Oct   We took Steve and Sylvia to Cinnamon Bay to pick up some snorkeling skills. They did okay - Sylvia was a bit nervous but she got the hang of it. Jon talked them into trying Scuba.   25 Oct.   They tried to learn, at least. It wasn't for them. All four of us went diving with Low-Key again. We did a drift dive at Lind Point. Steve and Sylvia worked on their tans.   26 Oct   We rented a 28' and trawled. We caught 2 fish, a mooring float, and a boobie (the bird, people!). All were safely freed. We tried snorkeling at Waterlemon key, but the tide was awful strong. As we trawled I sat on the bow and enjoyed watching the islands slowly drift by.   27 Oct   Scuba! Little St. James and Calf Rock again. The currents are preventing us from going out to other sites. Jon was excited because we finally saw a turtle.   28 Oct   Oh, my Diety - We spent the day shopping in Charlotte Amalie. A word of advice: if you are going to go on vacation with people who have different tastes than you, AT LEAST make sure they are comfortable with going off on their own!   Jon and I did another night dive, this time at Grass Cay with a new mask. I had a much better time. Saw a stingray, octopus, tarpon, and a teeny nurse shark.   29 Oct   Steve and Sylvia's last day - we went back to Cinnamon Bay yet again and snorkeled. I can't get over that place. I need to become a bazillionaire one of these days and just buy the whole island.   We got them to the ferry and I hate to say it but I was relieved that they left. To celebrate, (well,I was celebrating. they are my husband's friends), we went yet again to the Beach Bar and had buffalo wings and beer.   30 Oct   Jon and I ended up being the only people on the dive boat besides Travis (and the way cool and ever reliable Billy the captain). Steve Simonsen showed up again, as well. It was nice of the owners to let us go out any way. That couldn't have been profitable, but it does wonders for your customer service reputation. We did a drift dive off of Hart's Bay which Jon and I agree was our favorite of our stay. Travis found a ledge where we counted 7 lobsters lurking about. We passed an incredible Wall-o-Tarpon. This place was chock-loaded with fish. We were with a strong current and we barely had to kick. I also got to see a sea turtle up close.   31 Oct   Yet more diving, this time with more people on the boat. Congo Cay and Mingo Cay. We were greeted by the sight of a waterspout way off in the distance. I live in tornado alley and I have to go on vacation to the Caribbean to see one. It didn't affect our dive. On Mingo Cay Jon and I went off alone again. These are our last dives so we take our time (Jon finally managed to learn some self-control).   We did not do anything Halloween night but watch horror movies on TV. And drink beer.   1 Nov   Oh, woe is me. I ran into Low-Key before the ferry left to buy a tee-shirt. One of the dive guides, Penny was behind the counter. She saw how upset I was at leaving and tried to cheer me up. Did I mention how much I liked this company?   We took the ferry to Charlotte Amalie and killed a little time before going to the airport to shop some more (AAAAAAAAAAAIGH!). That was Jon's idea. Last year we killed time by renting a Cessna 172 and flying around a bit. Now that was fun.   I remember when we flew in being excited and feeling bad for people leaving. Now I felt bad and was deeply envious of the people coming in. I spent some of the money remaining on several gallons of booze, although I'm mostly a beer person (if you didn't notice). Hey, it makes great gifts.    Anyway: Overall, despite the complaining I did in this commentary, we had a great time. The best part about it, besides the cat, was Cinnamon Bay and scuba diving with Low-Key. I whined about Moonsong but it was actually a nice place. It just suffered in comparison to the last place we rented. We did get to see the interior of Sundance, its companion home, and *that* place is really nice.   The weather was perfect; it rained some but never for long. I think Jon and I got very lucky, because it wasn't more than 2 weeks after we left the islands got drubbed by rainfall. The ocean was clear and beautiful; next time we go I would rather go again in July because it seemed calmer at that time of year.

      Shoulders and legs day. Do you know why I love squats so much? Because if feels so good when I stop!  I'm feeling back in the exercise groove; I've decided I should run on Saturday and do a little more weight training on Monday to supplement my Tue/Wed/Fri workouts.    Last night I watched a movie I haven't seen in ages:  urlLink The Towering Inferno . Unlike  The Swarm , this movie is actually decent meow. I won't say great; it is somewhat dated. But what a cast! Both Paul Newman AND Steve McQueen. I spent some of the movie wondering whose eyes were bluer. My vote is McQueen.  I fondly recall that when my sister and I saw that movie, she decided she wanted Newman, and I wanted McQueen. I was 11 in 1975. In some ways I miss all those hormone rushes. Middle age sucks.  It also had William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Richard Chamberlain - you know, when he came out of the closet I was relieved I no longer had to feel guilty over all those times I saw him and thought "I bet he's gay". Not that there's anything wrong with that meow.  While the movie held up its tension in some places, in other places my eyes were crossing at how slow the action was creeping. I found another use for TiVo at that point: I sped up the entire 'scale down the twisted stair railings sequence' from about 5 hours to a half a minute. TiVo rules!  Some of the fun of this movie is the old-fashioned sexism: Newman and Dunaway are a couple - I could never figure out if they were married or not. Newman has just gotten a job out in bumblefuckmeow, Montana; and Dunaway has just been promoted in her job in San Fransisco. You don't have to be psychic to figure out who gived up his or her job by the end of the movie.    I taped  urlLink Midway , a movie about the turning point in the war in the Pacific. It has an amazing cast, including Charlton Heston. He's not an ex-listee, he has always had his own little niche in my heart.  Oh, yeah: editorial note. To all the people who mealy-mouthed Mr. Heston for becoming the head of the NRA. How dare you paint a man who marched with Martin Luther King, Jr. as some sort of ultra right-wing fanatic! I'm glad that Bush got elected; if nothing else because you aimed your 2-minute Hate sessions at someone else. Disagreeing with his stance on the 2nd amendment is one thing; making fun of his Alzheimer's is another. Yeah, you, George Clooney, you little meowdweeb!   Enough of *my* 2 minute Hate. More like a 2 minute grudge. I don't hold Clooney's stupidity or politics against him. If I did that, I'd have to do it for other actors then I'd probably never see another movie again.  Back to  Midway . Heston or no, cast of thousands or no, it is a boring-ass movie. I must have seen it a million times when I was a kid but this time it's slow going. I think I mentioned this before; it suffers from  Titanic  syndrome: much of the story is about a young pilot who is in love meow with a Japanese-American (whoopsie!). It hasn't really gotten to the battle scenes yet, so maybe I'll appreciate it more later on.  And in other news I'm hoping to talk Jon into going to see  urlLink Club Dread  with me. It's been a while since Bill Paxton's been in anything humorous. I found the humor in   Super Troopers  a little uneven, but the stuff I found funny I found to be really funny meow.

        My Husband the Engineer part 3   Actually this is to praise him; he went out and bought a little gadget that people use to blow up air mattresses, and he used it to get a fire going in the fireplace stove. This time it got hot enough to heat the chimney so all of the smoke went up the flue. It also got the heat in the house up to around 90 degrees. When we went to bed the fire was nothing but embers and the stove was still warm when we woke up in the morning. The (expensive gas) heat never kicked on during the night.  I love the tropics; nothing like watching TV in your underwear in the middle of winter. I should have whipped up some frufru tropical rum drinks but I have to stop that for a while.  I'm always amazed by cats. Both of them sat in front of the fireplace and happily melted. Domestic cats are descended from desert creatures and they love being warm.   Speaking of cats, we have two: Vasquez, who is about 18 (I got her when I was in college); and Eruo, who is maybe 3. Euro is twice Vasquez's weight and he loves to pick on her. She can barely jump up on the table but she'll fight back if he's in a playful mood.   Vasquez is blase about moving; God knows she and I have moved to about 10 different places in the last 18 years. We got Eruo (actually, I can't pronounce that damn name either so I just call him Big Fat Kitty) at an animal shelter and he's only known our old house. He was pretty psychotic when we moved but he's adjusting. I can't keep him out of the kitchen cabinets though.   And even though cats are pretty much useless, Big Fat Kitty has one good but odd habit: at night when we've gone to bed he'll hop up on my legs (I sleep on my belly) and give my butt a massage. Jon thinks it's sick, but hey he's not getting one. Personally having a 16 pound cat kneading my gluteus maximii is quite soothing, especially after a heavy leg workout day. He's just jealous.  Speaking of workouts, yes I went yesterday and today. I am thinking that the new gym's treadmills are adjusted differently than the old gym's treadmills because I can't run as fast on the new gym's. At least not by their little gauges. But a weight is pretty much a weight so we have had no problems adjusting our weight training to the new gym.  I have had to quit doing dips; my left shoulder is hurting. Not bad, but I don't want to make it worse. I'm thinking I'm having a classical rotator cuff problem that comes from exercising one set of rotator cuff muscles and ignoring another set. Instead of the dips I'm doing  urlLink some of these exercises and stretches.  . Don't ask me why I'm looking at Dragon Boat pages. I have no idea why my right shoulder doesn't hurt.  I'm starting to experience insomnia again; I am now convinced it is because of hypocaloric eating. Oh, well. I have more energy like this anyway and can handle that metallic tired feeling better.  Top 10 favorite meals: (just because I'm hungry!)  10)  Grilled ribeye (medium rare) with romaine salad  If I'm in a carb mood a baked potato or fries goes well with this meal.  9)  Spicy Shrimp Scampi  This is basically shrimp cooked scampi style, then cayenne pepper, parmesan cheese, and italian bread crumbs are added to the pan. Mmm. I usually eat this with plain fettucini. Modified for low carb by omitting the bread crumbs and eating with spaghetti squash.  8) Curry  This is just a stew. Some sort of meat, stock, and veggies. The curry is curry powder, cream or milk, cayenne pepper, and a little sugar (or splenda). Infinitely variable.  7) Sushi  Especially a spicy tuna roll. I will eat sashimi, but I'm not too adventurous for that one.  6) Chicken Wings  And beer.  5) Lechon  Puerto Rican dish. It's basically a pork picnic shoulder that's marinated in mashed garlic, salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon juice (called adobo). Once you start roasting it in the oven, the smell is overwhelming and the entire neighborhood spontaneously starts drooling.  4) Angel Hair pasta in pesto sauce w/ italian sausage  Okay, I'm making myself drool  3) Chicken and Dumplings   Grandma's recipe. Veggie of choice: Green Beans.  2) Barbequed Ribs  mmmmmmmmmmm ribs, mmmmmmmmmm  1)  Arroz con Pollo  A Puerto Rican dish that I absolutely adore. I haven't made it in years because Jon doesn't like it. The chicken is marinated in adobo.  Some day I'll have to put these recipes on the web. Here's the one for the Arroz con pollo:  Adobo: for each pound of chicken:  1 Garlic clove 1 tsp of salt 3 pepper corns 1 tsp dried oregano 1 tsp vinegar 1 tablespoon olive oil. Mash the dry stuff to a pulp; add vinegar and olive oil. Slather the meat w/this marinade and refrigerate for about 24 hours. This marinade I use on just about any meat in existence.  1 cut up chicken 1/4 pound ham, diced 2 tablespoons olive oil 1 medium onion, diced 1 can Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and peppers 2 cups long grain rice. 4 cups liquid (combo of water, stock, Ro-Tel liquid) 1 Tablespoon turmeric Cayenne if desired.  In a dutch oven heat olive oil in medium high heat. Add chicken and brown. Toss in ham and onions somwhere. After a while add rice and stir so that the oil will coat the grains. Add the tomatoes and peppers, turmeric, and a little cayenne. Puerto rican dishes are *not* spicy, that's my addition. So is the turmeric, to be honest. They use saffron. Add liquid and leftover marinade. Bring to a boil, put lid on, and set stove to low for 20 minutes. Turn off heat and leave alone for another 10 minutes. Stir gently and then it should be ready to eat.  This stuff tastes even better the next day.

      What a gorgeous weekend that was! I jumped 7 times; 3 student jumps and 4 fun jumps, including a sit-fly with my brother.  urlLink Our little DZ  needed a weekend like that. One of the student jumps was with a young man named Richard Winters, which tickled me to no end.  Well, I finished up   the Forsyte Saga II  and it did not end as bad as I thought it would. Matter of fact I was very happy with the ending even if it wasn't 'happy ever after'. Soames and Irene, both in their 60's, finally made peace. And since I was sniffling into my hankie on the couch, this leads me to my top 10 list:    Top ten movies/TV shows that have made me cry (in no real order):   urlLink The Forsyte Saga II   Near the end, Fleur expresses a great deal of hatred towards her father, Soames. She blames him for destroying her chances of marrying Jon. Jon's mother, Irene, was married to Soames, remember (also remember this is a soap opera).  She left him after he raped her. Fleur lashes out at her father, saying he must have done something horrible to make Jon's parents hate her so much (they did. Boy I was pissed at both of them for blaming Fleur for what Soames did.) Soames tells Fleur exactly what happened. And in a jaw-dropper, he expresses great remorse for doing something so horrible to someone he loved so greatly. Soames up to that point has never expressed *any* emotion. Fleur sees the agony her father is in; has always been in; and forgives him. And I am a sodden puddle on my couch.   urlLink Untamed Heart  I curse forever my sister for showing me this movie. This is exactly the type of movie I detest. Usually I can sneer cynically through them, like I did with  City of Angels  or  Phenomenon , but I shamefully cried at the end of this one.    urlLink Saving Private Ryan  I cried both during the invasion of Normandy sequence and the end, though I felt more manipulated at the end. Still. I know people think the violence is bordering on pornographic, but if you were to watch war movies from the 50's and 60's only, you would get the impression that most soldiers died of acid indigestion (they wince, clutch their chest, and slump down).  I don't think it's a bad thing to show exactly what happens in war.   urlLink Spartacus  It wasn't Spartacus' death (oops, hope I didn't ruin it for you), it was the death of freedom through political machinations.  Spartacus  is very much a Libertarian-themed movie. I also got misty during Maximus' death in  Gladiator , but I was left feeling manipulated.   urlLink Band of Brothers  Of course. I cried at the ending of the last episode, not for the men who didn't make it, but for the men who lived. Most of them put the war behind them and lived their lives. I was crying as Major Winters voiced over everyone's fate - I was hit with a big wave of melancholy as I realized those that the war didn't take were slowly being taken by time. At least they had lives, but it's still sad to think about.   urlLink The English Patient  A gorgeous movie with gorgeous actors. I don't find this movie romantic one bit. Well, a teeny bit. It is a horrible tragedy, a good illustration of the Law of Unintended Consequences, as two people have an affair and the destruction that follows. Very sad. *Sniff*   urlLink Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon  I was a basket case during that particular scene. Compare the characters in this movie to those in  Love Story  a movie that meant nothing to me. Honorable mention to  The Ice Storm , another Ang Lee movie: when Kevin Kline bursts out crying at the end, so did I.   urlLink The Return of the King  When Frodo said goodbye to Sam Gamgee I was sniffling along with him.   urlLink 12 Monkeys  Not being able to escape one's fate. Quite depressing. Honorable mention to  Brazil , which left me teary-eyed as well.   urlLink Grave of the Fireflies  Oh, god. These were in no particular order, but this one is number One with a bullet. Emphasis on the bullet, which I would have gladly used on myself after watching this movie. This is a Japanese animated movie about two World War II war orphans. Holy shite I was a basket case after seeing this one. Absolutely guaranteed to make you bawl your eyes out.   I sent my first text message yesterday via cellphone. I am slowly being dragged, kicking and screaming, into the 21st Century.

      Good news: we have rented out the old house. That's a load of financial worry off my mind. Unless they are late with payments.  We finally seem back into the swing of things since moving. I took it easy on Shoulders and Legs day at the gym, but it's been three weeks since we've done them so I took it easy weight-wise especially when doing squats and stiff-legged deadlifts. I can all ready tell though I'm going to be sore in the morning. Bad me! No cookie!   Spike TV  (how cool to name a network after a vampire!) has this show called  Extreme Elimination  or something like that. It is kind of like "Iron Chef" in that it's an overdubbed Japanese show. The dubbing goes for yuks (aimed at 5 year old boys, just like the entire network); the only reason I watched more than 5 minutes of it was because I was shocked that any one would let themselved be abused on TV like that. Oh, who am I kidding? I was laughing at those poor fools.  It reminds me of a  Dilbert  strip, where Dogbert (who had acquired a large amount of money) offered a man $10,000 dollars to wallow face-down in a puddle of mud. He enthusiastically complied; and Dogbert said to himself "I don't see how rich people could ever get bored!"  I remember a conversation about  Fear Factor , which is as close to that Japanese TV show as we've got; where I said if someone gave me $10,000 bucks, sure I'd chow down on a plate of roaches. I'd have to be guaranteed the money though. I wouldn't go through that kind of hell and humiliation for free! Or a chance to be on TV. Matter of fact, I try to avoid cameras.  Jon and I saw bits and portions of  Extreme Elimination  while watching VH1's  I Love the 80's Strikes Back . I did not realize how weird the 80's were. The big hair, the music sung by guys wearing lipstick, and of course the beginning of the computer age (Atari 2600, anybody?).  I wonder if we realize that we are living in a science fiction world. I may be wrong, but as a child I don't recall any science fiction book predicting the World Wide Web. The first computer I learned to program was a Radio Shack Trash 80; now I own a cell phone that's ten times more sophisticated than that thing. I own an mp3 player that can store 20 gigabytes of information (or 5,000 songs, approximately). It can hold pretty much any type of data, however. I do seem to recall them predicting CD/DVD players.  I just heard a rumor that Ken and Barbie (who just broke up) were originally marketed as brother and sister. Great! Alabama Trailer Trash. And don't get on my case about stereotyping! When Jon and I went to the courthouse to see about our marriage license, the lady behind the counter told us the day before an uncle and niece tried to get hitched. Ew. Anyway, Barbie has thrown Ken over for an Australian Surfer Dude. Oh, yeah, that will last.  Speaking of Spike,  FX  is showing season 7  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  episodes. I wish I had found out sooner because I missed the first 5 or 6 episodes of that season. As it is I did see one ep I hadn't seen before, "Selfless" which is about Anya's decision not to be a vengeance demon again.  Next to Spike, Anya was my favorite. In this episode we learn her origins as a vengeance demon and discover she has always been socially clueless, even before demonic status. We get a nice flashback to "Once more, with feeling", where Anya sings a song about being Mrs. Xander, then whammo we fast-forward to the present to see her pinned to a wall by a sword through her heart. Buffy-delivered, of course. Takes more than that to kill a demon though. I realize time was running short, but I wish she had gotten more of a eulogy at the end of BtVS than "That's my girl, always doing the stupid thing!".  And D'Hoffryn was kewl. "Never go for the kill, when you can go for the pain!" Very demony.  And it sucks about WB cancelling  Angel . I have heard rumors that they are shopping the show around; maybe it will end up on UPN like Buffy did. Hell, maybe I'll be able to see it then! Here's hoping that no matter what Joss Whedon will get a job somewhere.  This blog entry is scattershot. Oh yeah, I found out the other day that they will not cut off Ewan's masculinity in the domestic release of  Young Adam . Hooray, but I'll still have to wait until DVD, I bet.

      I didn't have much time to write anything so I dug something I wrote up last year:  I have never had jury duty before so I was looking forward to it (it also gave me several days away from the office, which was pleasant).   All the cases were criminal - at the beginning of the week there were 136 cases. I was in the first group of 30 to be called out and we were asked a bunch of questions by the prosecutor and defense lawyer. The questions were pretty innocuous - were you a victim of a crime, were you ever arrested, do you know anyone in the courtroom, etc. After the questions, the prosecution and the defense 'struck' jurors - they took turns and called numbers out, striking out the people they didn't want on the jury, until 12 remained, one of which was me.   So the judge gave us some preliminary instructions - I don't really remember what they were. She told us what the charges against the defendant were - DUI, driving w/a revoked license, driving a car without a license tag. Then the prosecution gave introductory arguments, then the defense.   The prosecutor was a young man, I'd say in his early 30's. He was well dressed and confident. He had that Sam Waterston thing going pretty good. The Defense looked to be in his 50's, very much an Alabamian and a drama queen.   Any way, I won't go into a blow-by-blow, but the prosecution then had 4 witnesses, the arresting officer, a security guard who had radioed the officer when he had smelled alcohol, the officer who had driven the defendant to the jail, and the officer who was supposed to have administered the breathalyzer test.   The prosecution's argument was this: the defendant had driven to a housing project with a friend, and was stopped at the gate by the security guard. The defendant wanted in to visit a relative, the relative was not on the list of tenants (this place had a real bad reputation and was in the process of being shut down). The security guard sent him away and informed the arresting officer about his suspicions the people in the car had been drinking. The officer, in an unmarked car, followed the defendant and saw him weaving some, so he pulled him over. He gave him some field sobriety tests and the guy failed.   The arresting officer's car did not have a cage in the back. He radioed for someone to come pick the defendant up to take him to jail. That officer smelled alcohol on the defendant's breath. At jail, he refused to take a breathalyzer test. The officer who was to administer it stated she smelled alcohol on the man's breath.   Then it was the defense attorney's turn. He only had 2 witnesses - the defendant and his mother. The mom went first, stating that her son had been with her all day - there had been a death in the family and the funeral had been that day. At midnight her son had received a call from a drunk friend who had asked him for a ride from the bar he was at. Against his mother's pleas, he went to get his friend. She stated he had left her house about midnight. The trip to the bar would have taken 15 - 20 minutes. Since he was arrested at approximately 12:38, the defense claimed the defendant simply had not enough time to get drunk.   The defendant had had an accident when he was 18. He had a learning disability in the first place, and emotional problems. The accident included brain trauma which caused almost total hearing loss. He claimed the failed the field sobriety tests because of his disability, not any drinking. He claimed he and the arresting officer argued, and that he had been a bully. The defendant was skinny and short, and the arresting officer was a bulldog-looking fellow.   Closing arguements were made, then the judge told us what to do. We had to elect a foreman first off- I volunteered for some reason, and got the job because no one else wanted it. Then we had to figure out who the hell was lying to us.   We found that poor bastard guilty. Why? Someone was lying to us, and we found more problems with the defendant's story than with the police. The defense lawyer did not offer up one shred of proof of the defendant's disabilities. None. This lawyer wasn't incompetent - he was playing the sympathy card hard-core. Medical and social services documentation would have gone a long way into getting the jury on his side.   And his mother - she obviously loved her son and took care of him. She could drive - she knew her son had no license. Why didn't she go get the drunk friend?   On one hand we had police officers. Did they have a conspiracy? I doubt it. On the other we have a mother with a troubled (33 year old) son who had been in scrapes with the law before.   I felt really bad for both of them (all of us did), but I didn't feel bad about convicting him. It's a damn shame you can't sentence someone to 20 years to being a productive citizen because sending that poor sod to jail isn't going to do anybody good. But that wasn't up to me.   By the time we finished up, the rest of the cases either had juries or were pleaded out.   It's kind of tough to forget about what happened. I think of every one who left a party and got away with drunk driving. I quit doing it when I was 33, when I got out of a DUI by a couple of hours (a couple of hours earlier, I would have registered above the limit). I think I understand that 'jury of your peers' thing a bit better. It was very tough voting guilty because it could easily have been me.   On the other hand I received a letter from the D.A. which informed me that was the guy's 5th D.U.I. conviction.   When they sentenced him they gave him 5 years probation. Yeah, that will teach him! Sheesh, I hope he keeps himself clean.

      Chest and Triceps day. I do like the new gym; it is about a mile from our house so when it gets warmer I may just run to the gym for my cardio. There's a pretty park on the way with a running trail, as well.  I didn't do any jumping last weekend; the weather sucked. We did have a chili cookoff which I'm embarrassed to say I won. Embarrassed because as an owner of the drop zone I should have disqualified myself. But I won a spiffy tee-shirt so screw them.  It's also embarrassing because my recipe is so damn simple. Chili is nothing but ground beef stew.  I finally crossed a border I hoped I would never have to cross. I got a cell phone. Now I have to remember to carry the damn thing with me. I bought the cheapest thing I could find and it still has more features than I'll ever bother learning about, including a color display.    Top 10 Songs I Would Set Myself on Fire Just So I Wouldn't Have to Listen to Them Again:   10:  Cracklin' Rosie  Neil Diamond  I know every lyric to every Neil Diamond song and it's my parents fault.    Oh I love my Rosie child You got the way to make me happy You and me, we go in style Cracklin' Rose you're a store bought woman But you make me sing like a guitar hummin' So hang on to me girl, our song keeps runnin' on... Play it now-ow, play it now-ow, play it now my baby   I should sue them for child abuse.  9:  Dancing Queen  Abba  Arg.   8:  (Everything I Do) I do it for You  Bryan Adams  A soul-sucking song I associate with a soul-sucking movie:  urlLink Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves . Exacerbated by my husband's love of Bryan Adams AND Kevin Costner.  7:  Staying Alive  Bee Gees  Falsetto Disco Shite. I should sue my sister for sibling abuse for this one.   6:  Billy Don't be a Hero  Bo Donaldson and the Heywoods.  Double Arg.  5:  Turn the Page  Bob Seger  Mournful saxophone over Seger's whining about being a rock star. Oh, you poor man! If you can't stand being on the road, get a real fucking job!!!  4:  Juke Box Hero  Foreigner  I have a lot of hated memories from my teen years, Foreigner is one of them.  3:  Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin  Journey  Journey is another. At least I could laugh at Loverboy!  2:  Safety Dance  Men Without Hats  When the U.S. Army Rangers are sent to flush me out of my well-fortified compound, the Psy-ops guys will crank this up and play it night and day. I'll crack well before 24 hours are up and they can shoot me down as I run out of the compound screaming at the top of my lungs. It will be a mercy at that point.  1:  Come on Eileen  Dexy's Midnight Runners   Oh my god this song sucks. How the *hell* did it become a top-40 hit? It has a fiddle AND a banjo! Who is to blame?  Tura lura kiss my big fat cellulitic ass!  What can I say? Music makes me passionate.

      For Back and Bicep day we tried out Hartselle's one and only gym. It was decent; only really small. The free weight room was well-equipped; it has squat cage which is my main concern. The best thing about the gym is that it's so close to our house I can drive home and take a shower before going to work.  Some days I listen to my MP3 player at work. I have about 200 songs in one folder that I set on "random" but I swear the player has its own agenda. It started out on a Joy Division song (existence well what does it matter / I exist on the best terms I can / the past is now part of my future / the present is well out of hand) so I can tell it's going to be moody.   Top 10 television shows I wouldn't have missed even if I was set on fire:  10) urlLink Starsky and Hutch   Yeah, I had a thing for David Soul. What was I thinking? Most memorable episode: The scene-for-scene ripoff of  Play Misty for Me . At least, that's the only ep I remember.   9) urlLink The Rookies   I had a thing for Micheal Ontkean, ok? I don't remember a damn episode from this series except a tie-in with SWAT (Robert Urich. Man, I am so predictable).  8) urlLink Kolchak: The Night Stalker   No, I did *not* have a thing for Darren McGavin, although he's always a hoot to watch. This show, nicknamed "monster of the week" by those who loved and hated it, was part of the inspiration of the X-Files.  7) urlLink Wiseguy   This show was the first real show to try 'story arcs', first with Ray Sharkey's Sonny Steelgrave arc then the then-unknown Kevin Spacey's Mel Proffit arc. This show was about an undercover cop going after mob figures. After the first season this show slowly deteriorated but I hung on to the lackluster end. Personally I think Ken Wahl is a fat tub of goo but I always appreciated Jonathan Bank's turn as Frank McPike. Any one who remembers Elvis and Priscilla Prim will understand what I'm talking about.  6) urlLink Quantum Leap   No, I didn't have a thing for Scott Bakula, either. Dr. Sam Beckett lept from body to body within his own lifetime, trying to correct the past. In a wierd way, this show was a reflection of everybody's frustrated daydreams: go back in time and try and fix something, even if it is simply a chance to talk some sense into some idiots. Think about it; go back in time and stop Klebold and Harris; go back to the set of  The Crow  and show the actor who killed Brandon Lee (*sob!*) the defective prop gun; warn airport security on 9/11/01.  5) urlLink MacGyver   Okay, I did have a thing for Richard Dean Anderson, though I so wanted him to get a haircut (He listened to me for  Stargate SG-1 . Woo-hoo!). But anyway, MacGyver was the nerd version of Indiana Jones. I loved his ability to think his way out of a problem, although sometimes his dislike of guns got annoying. Oh, sure blow shit up but don't use a firearm.   4) urlLink The Incredible Hulk   Oh, hell yes I had a thing for Bill Bixby.   3) urlLink Alien Nation   This show, short-lived as it was, has a special place in my heart. It concerned a space ship full of slaves that crash-lands on earth and how the survivors try to integrate themselves into society. The catch is is these ex-slaves are physiologically superior to humans in almost every way. I really liked alien police officer George Fransisco and his family (except his son needed some smacks), and his partner, Sikes. Sikes fit the mold of loner wild-cannon cop, except he was allowed to actually be somewhat pathetic, bitter and lonely. He had a thing for a lady alien despite some prejudices. Character development and interesting stories made this series. Release these on DVD, all ready!  2) urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer   Once I started watching it, which was the middle of season 7. Finally they managed to end a series on the correct note.  1) urlLink The X-Files   My brother made me watch this around the middle of the second season. Sure David Duchovny's cute but I watched this show for Scully. It's still my favorite series of all time although Buffy is a close second. Ended in a mess as the major uber-arc really never made sense. Big deal; there are so many standalone (or almost standalone) episodes that shone: Irresitible, Beyond the Sea, Bad Blood, Humbug, Squeeze, and Pusher.  I'm sure I'm leaving out a huge chunk of great episodes. Oh, hey, Krychek was hot. He was such a bad, bad, boy...   I'm going to have to start rewatching the X-Files from the first season.

      I finished watching  The Longest Day  and I don't have much to add. It comes across as several different movies, depending on whether you are watching American, English, or German points of view. That is because it was directed by four different men. The Americans come across as gung-ho, the British droll (one amusing scene has a young Sean Connery bitching about a bagpipe player), and the Germans intelligent, but frustrated by their own military beraucracy and a leader who's a wingnut (Der Fuhrer, of course).  This movie is the fourth that I have seen with at least portions of the invasion of Normandy portrayed. The others include  urlLink Band of Brothers ,  urlLink the Big Red One , and  urlLink Saving Private Ryan . I don't really have a point; just it is a fascinating point in time where the Allies start re-taking Europe.  Speaking of Lee Marvin (honest, I was)  urlLink The Dirty Dozen  is a fictional story that takes place just before D=Day. Turner Classic Movies just showed it. No commercials! Kewl!   He trains a dozen soldiers who had committed all kinds of crimes to go on an impossible mission. Who will survive? Pay attention to who committed what crime and you can pretty much guess. It wasn't as good as I remembered it.   One movie that was as good as I remembered it was  urlLink The Great Escape , though it's a lot more downbeat than I remembered. Great cast, including Steve McQueen, James Garner, Richard Attenborough, and James Coburn. One gripe about Coburn. He played an aussie and had a terrible accent. Other than that, it's a gripping three hours.  After all that testosterone it was a blessing to switch to estrogen-drenched british soap opera. I got through part one through three of  urlLink The Forsyte Saga II . Soames has mellowed a little bit; I love the scenes he has with his daughter because he finally displays some real affection. It's maybe because Fleur honestly loves her father. There was a scene where they danced together where all of a sudden his hunched, stogy old self became graceful. And maybe he was a little, itsy bitsy happy.  I'm dreading part 4. It can't end well; it just can't.   Someone better cast Damian Lewis in a silly, girly-girl romantic comedy as the lead. I have a feeling however he's going to get stuck playing creeps due to certain  urlLink prejudices .

      Well I wrote something for Sunday - concerning a bunch of movies I saw that day because it rained, but I couldn't post it because something was wrong with our DSL connection. I'll post it later on when I get home if it's working.  And even though I promised to hit it hard for the next 90 days I didn't go to the gym this morning because I was up later than I wanted to be cleaning out a wood stove fireplace insert.  That statement is my segue to this:   My Husband the Engineer Part 2   Our new house has a fireplace. The fireplace has what is called a wood stove insert. Neither the stove nor the fireplace has been used in years. Jon called a chimney sweep to come clean up and inspect everything. Once that was done, he bought a cord of fire wood.  He tried three times to start a fire; all three caused a great deal of smoke and frustration. Hey, our smoke detectors work so that's something. After his second attempt I told him to let the stove get cold then I would look at it. He explained he had all ready looked and couldn't see a problem.  Stove cooled down, it's now 9 at night and I have crawled halfway into a dirty stove trying to explore everything with my hands, because I couldn't see anything. I did discover that there was a big slab of horizontal sheet metal below where the stove opens up to its vent. This metal was blocking any direct view of the vent. By touch I was able to tell how the vent opened. I also found where the chimney sweep had knocked most of the carbon from the flue; right through the vent onto aforementioned sheet metal slab, effectively blocking the venting, hence the smoke flavored house.  So I got that cleaned and cleared and I kept my husband from trying to start another fire simply because it was so late at night and he had turned his attention to raging at Bell South because the DSL had quit working again.  He tried it again this morning but there was still copious amounts of smoke in the house. We are going to pull the stove out (it sucks, anyway. It might be more energy efficient, but I'd rather have a fire I can look at) and I bet we will get a nice shower of even more carbon. The damn thing doesn't have any kind of flue cap so it should be nice and nasty. Note to myself: buy some Lava soap this afternoon on the way home.

      In time for Valentine's Day:   Top 10 Cutest Couples that I could think of off the top of my head:   10:  Kim Cattrall and Kurt Russell   urlLink Big Trouble in Little China   A fun, snarky couple in a fun, snarky movie. Sprinkle on some Kung Fu for extra flavor. Kurt Russell and Dennis Dun make a cute twosome, too.  9:  Ron Livingston and Damian Lewis   urlLink Band of Brothers   Especially Episode 10, where Nixon offers Winters a peace time job at his father's plant. Simply adorable.  8:  Ralph Fiennes and Angela Bassett   urlLink Strange Days   Her brawn and his brain. I wish more movies had this kind of spark between the leads.  7:  Christian Bale and Emily Watson   urlLink Equilibrium   As with 8. the scene where they barely touched fingertips had more electricity than some all-out naked pretzel sex scenes I've seen.  6:  Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas   urlLink Strange Brew   I don't think I have to defend this one.  5:  Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer   urlLink Pulp Fiction   Nor this one.  4:  Tim Roth and Gary Oldman    urlLink Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead   Both of these guys play Evil Bad Guys so much, it was a shock to see them play such sweet, goofball losers. And they are adorable together.  3:  James Marsters and Sarah Michelle Gellar   urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer   I should also mention David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson here. The chemistry of both of these couples added a strong layer to both of their respective series. Alyson Hannigan and Alexis Denisoff make an awful cute real-life couple enough to deserve honorable mention.  2:  Chow Yun-Fat and Danny Lee   urlLink The Killer   This movie has been celebrated for its homoerotic undertones, almost to the same point as  the Lord of the Rings  (which I left off the list for being too obvious). Still, thier relationship is wonderfully poignant.  1:  Ben Affleck and Matt Damon   urlLink Dogma   Lots of jokes about these two have all ready been made. I'm not joking though, I think they do their most watchable work opposite each other.  Good Will Hunting  and  Jay and Silent Bob  deserve mention here as well.

      No gym today. We were both too sore.  We went out last night and ate sushi; a celebration for a bonus I got at work. Good timing, considering I have to shoulder two houses and an airplane payment this month.   I love sushi. All it is really is a medium for soy sauce and wasabi. No, that's not true; the rice has a distinct flavor and texture. The seaweed and the fillings all have more texture than flavor, it seems to me. I'm perfectly happy with a sushi roll that consists of cucumber, rice and nothing more. A have developed a taste for raw tuna, however. Spicy tuna rolls are my favorite.  Jon had to return a pressure washer to a friend after dinner so I flipped on the tv and caught the very beginning of  urlLink The Longest Movie .  I'm kidding.  The Longest Day  is a pretty good war movie about D-Day. The movie encompasses just about everybody's point of view, including German, British, and American military, as well as French Resistance. (One of the few woman's roles - and the only relatively big role for a woman in this movie - was a member of the French resistance. She was pretty kewl, and a nice change from the roles women normally play in mid-20th century war movies.)  When I mean encompass, I mean encompass. I don't think they could make a movie like this again. John Wayne, Richard Widmark, Robert Mitchum, Eddie Albert, Robert Ryan, Richard 'Master Thespian' Burton and a bunch of other familiar faces.  Wayne represents the airborne side of things; he commands a battalion of 82nd Airborne who has the objective of taking the French town of Ste. Mere-Eclise (sp!). These scenes amused me because they were the flip-side of similar D-Day scenes in  Band of Brothers (which has a more intimate look at one company in the 101st Airborne Division). Both had scenes where members of the 101st and the 82nd ran into each other and the confusion it caused. Very few if any of the 18,000 paratroopers landed in their correct Landing Zones that night.   The Longest Day  did not explain completely why everybody landed off;  BoB  - thanks to CGI - showed the terrific bombardment the jump planes were taking. Besides the bad weather and night time conditions, many pilots simply gave the paratroopers the green light so they could get the hell out of there.   TLD  did have a terrific scene where paratroopers ended up landing in the town of Ste. Mere-Eclese (sp?!?) itself; they ended up being target practice for the German troops stationed there. Owie.   TLD  also had a spiffy sequence of British Troops landing in these huge gliders. Damn, those landings were rough!  Anyway it's a long damn movie so I cranked up TiVo so I could go to bed. I'll finish the rest of it tonight.  My Top 10 favorite Villains:  10)  Hans Gruber  (Alan Rickman  urlLink Die Hard )  Oh come on of course he's in my top 10!   9)  Scorpio  (Andrew Robinson,  urlLink Dirty Harry )   A favorite because there is absolutely nothing likeabe about him. He is a completely evil creep. And when he starts whining about "I have my rights!" *I* wanted to beat him up.  8)  Judge  (Simon Yam  urlLink Full Contact )  He's a hoot because he's an  absolute  flaming homosexual and an  absolute  badass. I'm  absolutely  impressed that Yam pulled this role off as well as he did.  7)  Catwoman/Selena Kyle  (Michelle Pfeiffer,  urlLink Batman Returns )   Batman Returns  is one movie I would have liked to Script Doctor. Hey! That would make an *excellent* top 10 list! Another time, perhaps.   I would remove any mention of the Penguin (no offense to Danny DeVito) and focused this movie on Catwoman, Batman and Max Schrek (Christopher Walken). Catwoman could never figure out whether she wanted to fight Batman, or boink him. She tended to try to do both at the same time. Batman Returns captures some of that with some chemistry between Pfeiffer and Keaton.The scene where Selena and Wayne are dancing and they realize who each other are is classic.   6)  Archibald Cunningham  (Tim Roth,  urlLink Rob Roy  )  Dresses like a pansy, in his heart he's a ruthless punk. He had an Evil Bad Guy checklist when he went after Liam Neeson's noble Rob Roy: "Let's see: burn the house, kill the livestock, rape the wife... what did I forget? Oh, yes. Shoot the dog!"  5)  Hannibal Lector  (Anthony Hopkins,  urlLink Hannibal )  Yeah, he's on everyone's list too. However it isn't his elegant menace that I find interesting. I like how he expresses his outrage towards the world (by eating people. Most psychos grab a gun and shoot up diners or high schools; Hannibal kills people and turns them into gourmet dinners. Far more dignified).  One scene really appealed to my Inner Sociopath: Clarice Starling loses her job because of the machinations of a real creep, Arthur Krendler. Instead of eating Krendler, Lector drugs him up, cuts the top of his skull off, and feeds him part of his own brain. All in an elegant and classy way. Sorry; I haven't enjoyed cannibalism this much since  urlLink The Cook,The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover .  4)  Frank Booth  (Dennis Hopper  urlLink Blue Velvet )  HEINEKEN?!!? FUCK THAT SHIT!! PABST BLUE RIBBON!!!  Another bad guy so disgusting and unredeemable, he's a hoot to watch.  3)  T-101  (Arnold Swarzenegger urlLink The Terminator ) Originally Swarzenegger was going to play Kyle Reese. He wisely talked James Cameron into letting him play the bad guy. Movie history was born; pretty Sarah Connor and slight Kyle Reese against an unstoppable machine? It didn't look good for our heros. This is why he's on this list. The Terminator has a very logical reason to maim and murder his way through the phone book, a dance club, and a police precinct: he was programmed that way. He can't be bargained with, he can't be reasoned with, he doesn't feel pity or remorse. Or fear. And he absolutely will not stop. Ever.  Oh, come on! It scared me...  2)  Colquhoun  (Robert Carlyle  urlLink Ravenous )  Ravenous is one of my favorite movies nobody saw (another list for another time). Ravenous concerns two men who have discovered separately that if you eat human meat, it gives you superhuman strength. The down side is it also gives you insatiable hunger. Slightly built Robert Carlyle (another brit who gets stuck with a lot of evil bad guy roles) does a great job conveying both charm and animal hunger. He really plays well against Guy Pearce's equally famished but passive good guy who Colquhoun tries to seduce into giving in to and accepting his cannibalistic urges. Hmmmm. I have a wierd thing for cannibals. I'm really afraid to go exploring the Freudian explanations for that.  1)  Spike  (James Marsters  urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer )  Undead heart of a chaotic punk, buried soul of a weenie romantic poet. Equal parts menace, hotness, and shameless wanker. I almost wish he'd stayed villainous or at least kept walking that edge he found when he fell in love with the slayer. I'm somewhat glad he found a second life on  Angel  even though I STILL CAN'T SEE IT!!!   You know, this was going to be a quickie list, but I ended up doing a lot of thinking for it. I really don't like evil bad guys. Not because they are evil, but because many times I don't know *why* they are evil. Antagonists should do what they do because they think they are right. Plenty of sick bastards exist who can be classified as evil (John Wayne Gacy, Ted Bundy, etc), and plenty of bad guys are portrayed as psychopathic in movies. "He's just off his rocker" is a reasonable explanation, but it doesn't leave much room for empathy.  I have racked my brain (doesn't that sound painful?) but I can't think of any villain I have ever been that attracted to (Spike doesn't count! By the time I wanted to have his child he was working for the good guys). Even the villains I list deserve punishment for what they did even if I have empathy for their actions. I have talked (via internet) with a lot of women who have things for certain villainous characters. The classic example I guess would be Count Dracula in his various incarnations. Nope, doesn't do a thing for me. I simply don't get why someone would fall in love with an evil man.  I'm guessing that what fires many women's fantasy ovens are characters that need the lovin of a good woman to mend their wicked ways.  So this list turned out pretty pedestrian in the sense that many of my favorite villains are everybody else's favorite villains. On the whole I wish for more villains like Catwoman. I mean people who are this close ->|| to redemption but can't quite make it. It gives them a tragic, romantic edge that I like.

      We made it to the gym this morning: chest and triceps. I'm a bit miffed because I can tell I've lost a little even though I only took a week off.   All right: new plan. I'm going on a calorie-restrictive, targeted ketogenic diet; about 1200 calories a day. That means out of all my food, I'm going to eat about 60 grams of carbohydrates on work-out days and about 35-45 on non-workout days.   Starting the 16th of February, this will be my schedule:  Monday:   20 minute run, Stiff-legged deadlift, chin-ups, squats Tuesday:  20 minute run, back and biceps  Wednesday:20 minute run, chest and triceps  Thursday: 30 minute run - no weight training Friday:	  20 minute run, shoulders and legs  Saturday and Sunday I won't exercise - but I'll mainly be at the drop zone which can be plenty exercise enough.  I'm starting Monday because Saturday we are having a chili cookoff at the drop zone - chili and beer, beer, and more beer. Then I'm getting serious. Really. This time will be different.   Meh.  I'm going to upgrade my Blog one of these days so I can publish pictures. Then I'll take a photograph of my butt and display exactly why I want to lose a certain amount of body fat.  Currently I am happy to report I weigh 133. Happy because I didn't gain that much since I went off my last diet.  So anyway - anything else to report on today? I watched not much of anything last night. A few episodes of  Good Eats  where I learned that you can make chocolate sieze up and sock puppets can fart. I love that show.  I'm a tad annoyed about all the ado about Janet Jackson's boob. So what? All the busybody politicians (there's a redundant phrase if I've ever heard one) are threatening a huge crackdown. Trust me - if the NFL received thousands of complaints, that will keep them from having MTV produce the half-time show ever again. No need for government intervention.  I'm enjoying  urlLink Nancy's friend, Helly's blogs about stupidity.  We have a sticker in our King Air that says "Notice: you can't fix stupid". A non-skydiver might smirk about a skydiver calling another stupid, but skydiving is one of those areas where stupidity can and does lead to extreme amounts of pain.  I was going to write a long discourse about the dumbass things I have seen some skydivers do, but then again I have done some idiotic things. I try to be conservative, but gravity can be unforgiving and it only takes once. The skydiving collarary to "Stupidity should be painful" is of course: "If you're going to be stupid, you'd better be tough".  Quickie top 10 list o the day:  Top 10 favorite songs:  10: Ring of Fire  Johnny Cash  When I was young I was subjected to 8-Tracks of Johnny Cash and Neal Diamond. My loving of Cash and loathing of Diamond endures to this day. I'll sing along with Johnny, but if Neal comes on I'll bolt across the room to snap off the radio before the song gets stuck in my head. "Cracklin' Rosie you're a store-bought woman..." AAAAAIGH!  9: I fall to Pieces  Patsy Cline   This woman's voice *rules*.   8: Won't Get Fooled Again  the Who  Not only a kickass rock anthem, the lyrics aren't insipid ballads to some woman's hooters. "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss" indeed.  7: Bizarre Love Triangle  New Order  The only dance song I can think of that you can sing a capella and it still sounds good. Try it!   Every time I see you fall I get down on my knees and pray  Waiting for that final moment you say the words I can't say   Not that I can sing.   6: Birds of Paradise  The Pretenders  I blame an old boyfriend for this song. I get all choked up and nostalgic when I hear this one. I could say the same for the Ramones' "Blitzkreig Bop" though.  5: Wish You Were Here  Pink Floyd  More melancholy. Hey, it's an INTP thing.   4: I Apologize  Husker Du  Everything they did was at breakneck speed.    all these crazy mixed up lies floating all around  making these assumptions brings me down  and you get tight-lipped, how do i know what you think?  is it something i said when i lost my mind?  temper too quick, makes me blind i apologize.   3: Some Days are Better Than Others  U2  Bono is an ex-listee and I still love his voice - especially the way it floats over Edge's chiming guitar chords in this song. Another pop tune whose melody lends itself to a capella renditions.  2: Ain't that Pretty At All  Warren Zevon  Everyone should have a favorite Zevon song.   I'd like to go back to Paris someday and visit the Louvre Museum  Get a good running start and hurl myself at the wall  Going to hurl myself against the wall  'Cause I'd rather feel bad than feel nothing at all    1: When the World is Running Down  the Police  You make the best of what's still around - dunno completely why this is my favorite; the breezy melancholy gets to me every time I hear it. The Police remain one of my favorite bands.

      No gym today: Jon promised me we'll go Thursday and Friday. Hope so.  Nancy reminded me of a woman character I love:  8:  Diana Guzman  (Michelle Rodriguez,  Girlfight  )  This movie is about a Puerto Rican girl who lives with a lot of rage and finally finds a good outlet for it by learning how to box. I really liked this character, even though I almost didn't add her because while I admire her strength and will, she really is close to following her father's abusive footsteps. The best thing about this movie is she finds another father; she pays a reluctant boxing coach to train her and he slowly realizes he has a highly talented athlete in his hands. I had a huge lump in my throat when she wins a bout and her coach tells her how proud he is.  An editorial note: I've toyed with the idea of learning how to box; not to learn how to dish it out, but to learn how to take it. I think it would be highly useful to be still able to function while under pain and duress. Boxing is brutal and I really enjoy watching it when I can. I know a lot of people are repulsed by boxers and especially women boxers (don't watch it then, ya mooks). I wish I understood why women get a lot of shit for being physical - I think it's because it reminds people too much of men (sweat, muscles, and blood). What makes me laugh is the stereotypical woman athlete - a ballerina, ice skater, or gymnast, for instance - knows what sweat, muscle, and blood is, too.  For the record since I have started weight training I have had nothing but good experiences and feedback from the men who weightlift in the gym I attend. Remember I live in a really small Southern town.   Last weekend was so awash in mediocrity, I forgot to mention a movie I genuinely enjoyed: the 1961 version of  urlLink Zatoichi . I was expecting a Japanese Western - you know, lone gunman comes to town and cleans up the place. Zatoichi is different. He is a blind master swordsman. He taught himself the sword precisely because he's blind - he can't stand having people feel sorry or contempt for him.  He comes to this small town at the request of a gang boss; the boss has seen him fight and thinks having Zatoichi on his side would be useful. Zatoichi has no real desire to do any fighting for the boss but he does use his hospitality to freeload some.  Anyway, the boss of a smaller, rival gang has in his employ a samurai from Edo (a ronin, one would presume). Zatoichi and the samurai meet while both are fishing by a small lake and soon become good friends. You can see how it's going - both men were hired because of gang tensions. Zatoichi does not want to fight his friend but the samurai left Edo because he is dying from consumption. He would rather die in a fight with a legendary swordsman than by a lowly gangster or his own desintigrating body.  Zatoichi is so upset at the end of the movie he asks that his sword be buried with the remains of his Samurai friend. However, there's like 10 more movies in the Zatoichi series so I sincerely doubt he has completely hung up his sword-slingin' ways.  There's a whole lot more to this movie - some decently fleshed-out characters and surprisingly little swordplay. When there is, of course Zatoichi kicks major butt in his trademark underhand swordfighting style.  I'll have to watch more in the series. I'd also like to see the recent remake but Miramax is dragging it's collective butt in releasing it here in the states.   Jon and I watched  urlLink Rounders , a movie about poker players. It features cute as a button Matt Damon and just as cute Ed Norton. Norton impresses me more with every movie I see him in. Here he plays the just out of jail scumbag (aptly nicknamed 'Worm) who cheats at cards to Damon's reformed gambler, Mike.  What interested me about this movie was yes it was about poker, and the difference between being a sharp and a cheat, but the main plot was Mike's flaw wasn't his ability to play poker with the best, but his weakness for a no-good man, Worm. Mike lives with a woman (and she is the reason he has promised to stop gambling) but she is fairly irrelevant. I bet an already interesting movie could have been made more interesting if she hadn't existed altogether simply because Mike's relationship with Worm is so destructive. An undercurrent of homosexual love (or more of one, rather), would have gone a long way into explaining why he puts up with it.  The movie, besides having some cool poker sequences, deals with the theme of 'you are what you is'. Mike is happy playing poker, which he insists is not gambling. He utilizes his skills of keeping track of cards and odds, and reading other players to win. He is a law student, but when Worm gets back into town Mike starts playing again and he realizes what he has missed. Worm is what he is, too. He is a bad man, and it takes them both getting worked over by some angry cops before Mike finally realizes this and cuts that no-good loser loose.  Really, they do make a cute couple.  Here: ANOTHER top 10 list: My Top 10 favorite movies at this point in time:  10:  urlLink Office Space   I tried hard to think of a comedy to add to this list. Office Space won out because it's the comedy I have most recently worn out. At an earlier age, this slot could easily been taken by  Airplane! ,  Top Secret ,  Animal House ,  the Blues Brothers ; all movies I have worn out and can still enjoy.  Why  Office Space  then? Because I work in a cubicle. This movie is dead-on about the life-sucking experience of working in such an environment. Ron Livingston (someone once described him as looking like Charlie Sheen without the scumbag factor, and that's pretty accurate) plays a cubicle denizen who is at wit's end because he hates his job so much. Gary Cole's coffee sipping boss from hell is worth the price of rental alone.  9:  urlLink Toy Story   One Pixar movie had to make it on the list and this is it because it was the first. I was *blown away* by the animation values. Plus it had a great story, it's wickedly funny, and filled with wonderful characters.    8:  urlLink The Right Stuff   This movie about the Mercury astronauts did not get the box office it deserved. Scott Glenn, Dennis Quaid, Ed Harris, Fred Ward, Sam Shepherd and Lance Henriksen - the cast is a who's who of character actors from the 80's. Favorite line: "Our Germans are better than their Germans." This movie should be seen on a double bill with  urlLink Apollo 13 .  7:  urlLink Goodfellas   My favorite gangster movie. Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, Ray Liotta, and Lorraine Bracco give us the flip side of mobster life.  The Godfather  showed us vicious but somewhat noble gangsters; the characters in this movie are vicious thugs who wear bad clothes and like to cook a lot.  6:  urlLink Spartacus   This is one of the few historical epics that successfully touches on the human elements. Kirk Douglas is a god. And Tony Curtis was *hot* when he was young! No wonder Laurence Olivier wanted to get under his skirt. Uh, see the restored version to understand what I'm talking about. Character of note: Charles Laughton's Gracchus, a corrupt but surprisingly sympathetic Senator.  5:  urlLink The Year of Living Dangerously   Mel Gibson at his finest (mmmmmmmmmmmmmm). This movie is beautiful to look at. If one can classify this as a chick movie, then this is by far my favorite chick movie. A good bookend movie is Peter Weir's  Witness  - which had Harrison Ford at his finest. Both movies are hypnotic with great chemistry between the leads (something that wrecks more often than not most chick movies).  4:  urlLink Hard Boiled   My Hong Kong actioner entry. John Woo directed this and it features Chow Yun-Fat as a hard-boiled cop. Look, it has a 45-minute shootout in a hospital at the very end; what more do you want? It just is a kick ass movie.   3:  urlLink Dawn of the Dead   This movie is gory. I'm talking heads exploding, guts being ripped out, chunks of flesh being pulled off limbs gory. They just don't make movies like this any more! The thing this movie had going for it (and its sister movies, Night of the Living Dead and Day of the Dead) were characters you could care about so it is far more than a special effects extraveganza. I've been criticized for liking movies like this. I don't get it. Yes, it looks awful real, but those actors washed off the moulage and went and had beers after the director yelled 'cut'. It's not real, folks!  2:  urlLink Jaws   Spielberg at his finest hour. More than a movie about a shark terrorizing a tourist town, this movie shines because of the dynamics between Richard Dryfuss, Robert Shaw, and Roy Scheider on board a little boat in a big ocean.   1:  urlLink Aliens   I have declared this to be my favorite movie a bazillion times. Obviously I love action, war-oriented movies. In this movie even the women were sweaty, square-jawed, and heroic. This movie rises above the mindless action movies because each character is given enough time to not be just a faceless casualty. I love them all: Vasquez, the supercool tough hispanic chick; Hudson, the excitable wiseass; Hicks, the supercompetent, quiet NCO who finds himself in charge; Bishop, the android who turns out to be quite human; and Newt, the not annoying spunky little kid. And I can't forget the sleazebag company man Burke. And of course there's Ripley. She faces her fears and finds a second chance when lone survivor Newt is discovered on the now-colonized planet where the infected spaceship from  Alien  originally crashed.   I promise I'll eventually talk about other things. But in the meantime I have plenty of mindless entertainment saved on TiVo to watch and bore you with. Speaking of,  urlLink The Forsyte Sage part II  started last Sunday on PBS. I haven't had a chance to watch much of it (Jon is not into Masterpiece Theater, plus he found out how much I pant over Damian Lewis {happy birthday, you hot redhead, you} and is a little jealous).  I did see enough to know Soames hasn't changed that much; he treats his second wife badly but he dotes on his daughter. I do feel bad for the uber-uptight, repressed Soames. I swear when he sits down to take a crap he shits rebar. I can't wait to see how he reacts when he finds out his daughter falls for Irene and Jolyon's son. For that matter I can't wait to see how Irene and Jolyon react.   Oh, god, I'm caught up in a soap opera. Sheesh!

      Yay! Went to the gym this morning. I was feeling somewhat on the flabby side, even after only one week off.  This last weekend I did 2 skydives this weekend; one a fun jump and one AFF level 3 dive. This 2 dives a weekend is pretty pathetic; I want to hit the 1,000 jump mark by my birthday so let's see: I need 68 jumps and there's 13 weekends between here and then. I should be doing about 5 jumps a weekend. I just wish it would hurry up and get warmer.  So what did I do with the rest of my weekend? I watched a few movies. They all had one thing in common: mediocrity.  I finished  urlLink Battle of Britain . For an English movie it reminded me heavily of american war movies like  urlLink Midway  or even  urlLink Titanic : Take a historical moment for a backdrop and create some fictional characters to help 'personalize' the story. In this case I wasn't really interested in the characters - too bad, because the cast included Christopher Plummer, Amanda York, Michael Caine, Robert Shaw, and Edward Fox. (Seeing Shaw and Fox together reminded me of  urlLink Force 10 from Navarone , a movie I haven't thought of in years, for the second time in a few weeks. I know it ain't great but I had to put it on my Netflix queue). Anyway: spiffy flight sequences featuring mainly Spitfires and Stukkas.  Then my day got even more mediocre -  urlLink Raid on Rommel . Can a British commando train a rag tag group of P.O.W's mainly consisting of hospital personnel to blow up some guns in Tobruk? I guess if they are led by Richard Burton.  A quick aside: someone once complained about Laurence Olivier that the trouble with his acting is that you can tell he knows he's acting. Or to put it in another way, he reminds me of Jon Lovitz's character, Master Thespian. Not so exaggerated, but really: watch Olivier any time he acts. His acting is self-conciously stylized. I mention Olivier because he was in  Battle of Britain . And I mention his acting style to bring up Richard Burton - he's another Master Thespian.  Anyway back to  Raid on Rommel . Actually, no - I have nothing further to add. It was boring.   Now for something completely different, I saw  urlLink Metroland , with Christain Bale and Emily Watson. This movie had considerable Bale nudity (including a brief flash of frontal naughty bits), mostly from sex scenes. So what - this movie was mediocre, too. Far more interesting than  Raid on Rommell  but still I was unaffected.  Bale plays a man in his 30's who lives with his wife and baby daughter in the suburbs of late 70's London (nicknamed 'Metroland'). An old friend of his who is still living la vida loca comes by for a visit and tries to entice him into leaving his middle-class existence. A lot of the movie is Bale's flashbacks to when he was a young man living in Paris and the love affair he had with a french woman and how he met his English wife (Watson). I adore Bale, Watson is a terrific actress, but I still just can't recommend this movie. Maybe it was because suburbia is just plain boring, maybe it was the copious 70's hair. Eh.  And to cap off a mediocre weekend, last night Jon and I sat down to eat and I searched TiVo for something to watch. I was delighted to see that it had recorded  urlLink The Taking of Pelham 123 , a crime movie with Robert Shaw and Walter Matthau from the mid-70's. It is about a gang of robbers who take a New York subway train hostage. I bet I haven't seen that movie since it was in the theaters, but I remember I really enjoyed it.  Well dammit I hit play and something looks wrong. WTF - Vincent D'onofrio is in it. Excuse me, was he even alive in 1974? (I checked - he was 15.) Then Donnie Wahlberg sporting an amusing blond 'do shows up! (As Mr. Gray. Damn that was funny in an obscure way). Even though TiVo listed the original movie date and actor roster, I was watching a frickin made-for-TV  urlLink remake !  D'onofrio had the unfortunate task of playing Robert Shaw's character, Mr. Blue. He just ain't Robert Shaw. Well, nobody can fill Shaw's shoes; boy do I miss him. Nobody could play overbearing, aggressive, and loud like he could. Shaw was his own definition of machismo. Vincent D'onofrio - well, he plays wierdos real well. And he does a wicked Orson Welles impersonation.  Walter Matthau's character was played by Edward James Olmos and Lorraine Braccho. I have *no* idea why they felt the need to cast his character as 2 separate people but they did.If I have strong memories of a movie I saw as an 11 year old kid, it must have had something going for it. This remake was just eh. Blah. I was not happy. So I have slipped the original on my Netflix queue to see if my memories have merit.  This is a long entry - here's my top 7 favorite woman characters. I couldn't think of 10! I'm trying to decide if it is because there just aren't that many movies with women I like (I compared my list of favorite men to favorite women- they tend to share the same qualities I admire) or if there just aren't many movies with interesting women in them period. It is true, however, that the movies I like simply don't have many women in them.   7)  Lindsey Brigman  (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio,  urlLink The Abyss   Yes, I find it interesting that two characters from James Cameron movies made it to this list. I would have included Sarah Connor but I decided two was enough. For a while there Cameron was The God of Action movies.  Lindsey Brigman was remarkably different from Sarah Connor and Ellen Ripley because she was not instantly likeable. She refers to herself as a 'cast-iron bitch' and indeed that a fairly accurate description. But the biggest bitchy quality seems to be vindictiveness. She is merely abrasive. She is an engineer, dammit, and she dislikes anything getting in the way of her projects. She and Bud (ex-listee Ed Harris) are on the verge of divorce, and the wonder is why did he get married to her in the first place?   In one sequence they are trapped in a submersible with only one usable scuba unit. They are a good distance away from safety (at a depth of 2000 ft+) and their submersible is filling with water. In desperation, Bud asks her to think of a way to get them both back safely. She suggests to let her drown and he can haul her back to the rig and revive her. Of course he protests vehemently, but she convinces him it's the only rational choice. You see then one of his biggest attractions to her: her intelligence. It's also the scene that made me like her. I find this movie severely flawed but I really like both of these characters.  6)  Hildy Johnson  (Rosalind Russell,  urlLink His Girl Friday )  This movie was made when Romantic Comedies were romantic AND funny. His Girl Friday was directed by Howard Hawks, a filmmaker whose work always strikes me as hardheaded and practical. That's what I loved about Hildy Johnson - she is a hardheaded, practical journalist in a very male-dominated business. Russell's and Cary Grant's smart dialog in this movie is rightly regarded as classic.   5)  Eowyn  (Miranda Otto,  urlLink The Lord of the Rings )  One of the few female characters in this famous trilogy. When the movies were being made I remember my  one real hope was that they would give this character justice. For the most part they did; the scene where Eowyn and Merry put a hurting on the Nazgul is truly a joy to watch. I was sorry they gave her (and Faramir) such short shrift at the end of the series, but the movie was long enough as it was. Here's hoping some of that is restored in the DVD edition.  4)  Marge Gunderson  (Frances McDormand,  urlLink Fargo )  Marge is the super-competent and seven-months pregnant Chief of police for Brainerd, Minnesota. She (and her relationship with her husband) is the warm center of this super-cold and super-funny movie about a kidnapping gone horribly awry. And holy cow, what an appetite.  3)  Wing Chun  (Michelle Yeoh,  urlLink Wing Chun )  If I recall the legend correctly, Wing Chun developed the classic Wing Chun style of kung fu to get out of an arranged marriage with a horrible man. None of that is shown in this movie; this must happen after those events where she takes on some bandits that are threatening her village. This movie is light-hearted and many asses are kicked.  2)  Dana Scully  ( Gillian Anderson  urlLink The X-Files )  Yeah, it's a TV character but a movie did make it to the big screen so I get to claim her. Ultra-smart, level headed, the calm foil and anchor to Mulder's manic-depressive wild speculations.  1)  Ellen Ripley  ( Sigourney Weaver,  urlLink Aliens )  The Ripley character has been in 4 movies, but the only one where she mattered to me was this one.  urlLink Alien was good but the characters, all of them, were distant. She got to live because it was pro forma for one woman to live in a 'pick them off one by one' horror movie. That's right, Alien is the stylized cousin to  urlLink Friday the 13th  and  urlLink Halloween .   In  Aliens , however, Ripley is humanized. I'd like to recommend tracking down the extended edition which has two scenes that add to the character. In one scene we learn that Ripley had a young daughter who grew up and died of old age while she was in hibernation drifting along in outer space. This makes her bonding to Newt, the sole surviving colonist more understandable. The second scene is just before she leaves the ship to go rescue Newt. She checks on the one surviving Marine if he's okay, calling him by his last name, Hicks. He tells her his name is Dwayne. She replies "Ellen". A nice humanizing touch before she proceeds to kick alien ass.  That's pathetic. If anyone out there has some recommendations to add to this list, I'm all ears.

      Cold's over. I guess that means I'll have to go to the gym this week.   Maybe I'm just too much of a wallflower/nerd/stick-in-the-mud/geek whatever, but what in the Hell is the attraction of 'clubbing'? I understand a good deal of people who go are looking for someone to sleep with; but surely there's an easier way of picking up a partner than going to a loud, smoky, smelly place full of drunk people and crappy music?  I was dragged along to this club this last Saturday night. It had the wonderful name of - I shit you not - "Spank Daddy's". The only thing good I can say about it is the cover band was competent and did not play so loud that my ears bled. I guess if you are into people watching it's fun.   If I ever get a divorce, it will be because I hate dancing and my husband loves it. He's always trying to get me out on the dance floor and tells me there's nothing to be self-concious about. Well I'm a terrible dancer, and I have to concentrate so hard to keep any kind of rhythym I find the whole thing embarrasing. He keeps telling me that nobody's looking at me, but if that's so then why do he and his friends spend a great deal of time at the club pointing out how ugly people are/ what terrible dancers they are?  Okay, enough about my marital troubles. I will get to my top 10 women characters in movies in a bit; I'm still doing some research. In the meantime:  Sometimes movies at the bottom of the cinematic bell curve can be just as enjoyable as those near the top. I have some favorites - all of them marked by the fact that I have seen each of them more than twice (much to my embarrassment).  Top 10 favorite bad movies:  10) urlLink Shocker   What bugs me about this movie is that it starts out pretty good. A young Peter Berg realizes he has a psychic connection with a mass murderer who likes to kill whole families. One of his targets ends up being Berg's adopted family. He and his father are the only ones who survive. There are some questions about whether or not young Pete is the killer. Up to this point I found it compelling in a schlocky, teen-age way (like I found the Faculty). But then they catch the killer and things get really, really stupid. Still, I have a soft spot in my brain for this movie. And I was three seasons into the X-Files before I realized the bad guy was played by Mitch Pileggi.  9) urlLink Resident Evil   A movie based on a video game. Very much vaguely a poor Aliens clone substituting slow moving shuffling zombies for aliens. No plot to speak of and it's not even gory by flesh-eating zombie movie standards. Yet,... I like it. So sue me. Jason Isaacs' blue, blue eyes make a cameo appearance.  8) urlLink Wild Rebels   I saw this movie through the old Comedy Central show, Mystery Science Theater 3000, a show built around godawful movies. This movie is about a race car driver who is recruited by the police to infiltrate a gang of bank robbers. Sample dialog: "I'm in it for the kicks, baby!"  7) urlLink Godzilla Vs. the Smog Monster   Japanese hippies. *Heh!*  6) urlLink Commando   This is the nadir of Arnold Schwarzenneger's career (if you exclude 'Hercules goes Bananas'). Yet, it is the epitome of 80's mindless action movies. Bad dialog, ridiculous action, horrible continuity just add to the fun. Try and keep a bad guy death count for even more amusement.  5) urlLink Universal Soldier   This big-budgeted movie has the heart of a low-budget, direct-to-video, really stupid action movie. Starring two wooden planks, Jean-Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren. They play re-animated Vietnam war vets. Really. I don't know why it has any appeal to me but it does. Oh, sure, Van Damme is fun to look at, but there needs to be something more. See 'Commando' for other excuses.  4) urlLink Armageddon   Oh, God this movie sucks! Mindless, bombastic, and riddled with egregious scientific errors. Featuring a phoned-in performance by Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck's teeth, which he got capped specifically for this role. But hey, it also has Steve Buschemi, Owen Wilson, and the underappreciated William Fichtner. And Jason Isaacs.I highly recommend buying the Criterion Edition of this movie because of the commentary tracks: a) The directors track, just to hear Michael Bay speak. He is a self-important prick. b) The actor's track, especially Ben Affleck. His comments are hilarious and he has no illusions about what type of movie he's in.     3) urlLink Dreamcatcher   A blonde and a redhead are trapped in a cabin in the forest battling space aliens. How can I resist if said hotties are Thomas Jane and Damien Lewis? And throw in brunette Jason Lee, though he's taken out too early. This movie is loopy and you'd think Lawrence Kasdan would know better. Still, if you have ever been possessed by the urge to hear Thomas Jane belt out the Mighty Mouse theme here's your chance.  2) urlLink Pieces   This is a Spanish horror movie that came out in the 70's. It was Christopher George's last film and I can only suspect he died of shame. Psycho killer stalks nubile young college girls. Entertainment level is elevated by such scenes as: one proto-victim runs into an elevator somewhere in said college (she is clad only in a bikini). Psycho killer stops door from closing and gets in. The killer is wearing an overcoat, a scarf, and a hat pulled low and has a chainsaw hidden behind his back. The victim's response? "Oh. It's you." Rent it, if you can find it, to see the best damn non-sequitur ending ever committed to celluloid.  1) urlLink The Swarm   I was raised on 70's disaster films. I have soft spots in my brains for all of them: Earthquake, the Towering Inferno, all the Airport movies, and this one. Bees! Bees! Millions of Bees!! For ultra-pain, find the extended version.  Everyone involved in this classic was on heavy drugs, even Micheal Caine. Sharing in the shame are Henry Fonda, Richard Chamberlain, Miguel Ferrer, Patty Duke, Fred MacMurray(!), Olivia De Havilland (!!) and Slim Pickens (!!!).

      Okay; my lungs are better but now I have a nice sinus headache.   Hey,  urlLink I'm famous!  Uh, scroll down a bit. I posted yesterday's link to his site before I knew about this. I have a small handful of sites that I support financially; his is one of them.  Did I mention our new house has a pool? I have been bitching about it - I didn't want one - but I guess that sounds conceited. "Oh, I  hate  the new pool!"  Well, I do. They are vast money-sucking pits. I knew owning one would be a maintenence headache.  It rained hard yesterday; at about 9 in the evening my husband got worried about the pool overflowing. He bitched, whined, and went to Wal-Mart and bought a Shop-Vac - only to discover he couldn't use it to suck up water without buying another piece for it.  So he was set to head back to Wal-Mart and I pointed out to him that the Shop-Vac was pretty useless for his intended purpose; you might as well grab a couple of buckets and start bailing. I won't go into detail but the argument got a little heated.  So I stomped outside and stood there in the dark and the cold, wet rain; I contemplated the pool and I asked myself the magic question: "What would MacGyver do?"  I know what he would do: he would gather up some household chemicals and blow the damn thing out of existence. Me, I grabbed a serrated knife, pulled the garden hose off its rack, and measured a length of it from the pool to a nearby drainage ditch. I cut a length of hose off, applied suction, and voila, instant siphon.  Jon stared at me for a second, and did 2 things right. 1: he apologized for getting angry, and 2: refrained on making an oral sex joke. Had he done the latter I would have killed him - or maybe just pushed him into the wet, dirty pool.  I realize I haven't talked about diet, exercise, or skydiving for a while. That's because I haven't done any of those things for a week. I did get 2 skydives last weekend - both AFF dives; a level 1 and a level 2. I haven't done any instruction for the last 2 months and it felt good to knock some rust off. She was a good student, too. Thank goodness when they have a brain and take it with them on the dive.  So more movie stuff:  We finally got the living room organized; with some careful pre-planning we managed to get the digital cable box, TiVo, VCR, DVD, and the Laserdisc player all working in conjunction with each other. The living room is almost devoid of boxes. I settled down to watch  The Battle of Britain  but haven't finished it because I got interrupted by an overflowing pool.  So here's a top 10 list:  Top 10 favorite male characters from movies and why I like them:  10)  Peter Parker  (Tobey McGuire,  urlLink Spider-Man )  Loser nerd-boy develops superpowers. What elevated McGuire's nerd-boy to something special in my eyes was his growing understanding of the law of unintended consequences. I don't find McGuire attractive, but I do find Parker so. Like his uncle Ben pontificated on - the spider bite not only gave him super powers, but it also began his transformation into a man. And despite my anti-chick movie stance the angst between him and MJ is delightfully painful.  9)  Spartacus  (Kirk Douglas,  urlLink Spartacus )  What most people don't realize is that Spartacus, as Kirk Douglas portrayed him, is nothing like Russell Crowe's Maximus. Spartacus is not the baddest badass (he loses the one gladiatoral fight he participates in) - he is a clever, intelligent, compassionate leader of men.   8)  Peter Washington  (Ken Foree,  urlLink Dawn of the Dead )  Okay, if you woke up tomorrow and the world was overrun by flesh-eating zombies, wouldn't you want a calm, collected, intelligent, badass ex-SWAT team man taking care of you and your unborn child? Enough said.  7)  Han Solo  (Harrison Ford,  urlLink Star Wars )  Duh. What preteen girl in the late 70's didn't have an estrogen spike when he showed up in the cantina? Solo is the apotheosis of the scoundrel with a heart of gold. While his character is nothing new to movies, like someone said: "It's not who does it first, it's who does it best".  6)  Severen  (Bill Paxton,  urlLink Near Dark )  I'm not particularly fond of bad guys, and I'm not particularly fond of vampires. But Severen is evil incarnate in this movie, and his animal ferocity, his sheer joy at being aliv-er, undead, is infectious. Evil Bad Guy Goodness.  5)  Hoot Gibson  (Eric Bana,  urlLink Black Hawk Down )  Gibson is a Delta Force soldier - he comes across in the movie as a bit of a lone wolf, a professional warrior. Badass, super-competent. Intelligent. And hot. He's not completely aloof -  he offers advice to Josh Hartnett's young Ranger sargeant several times, trying to make him understand there's only so much responsibility you can shoulder in war.  4)  Quincy  (Jason Isaacs, urlLink Armageddon )   The smartest man on the planet. And, as Fox Mulder once pointed out, Smart *is* sexy. He's the guy who came up with the plan to save the world (remember the ketchup bottle speech?). He got so dissed; no one gave him a parade!  3)  Samwise Gamgee  (Sean Astin,  urlLink The Lord of the Rings )  The epitome of loyalty. We all know he's the real hero of the trilogy. Pudgy, thick, ordinary Sam saves the world because his friends needed him to.  2)  John Preston  (Christian Bale,  urlLink Equilibrium ).  Ruthless, cold-blooded, unquestioning (hot), until he manages to break the hold of the drug that makes him so. Betrays everything he thought was right in the name of emotion. Speaking of estrogen spikes: "I pay it gladly". Yow!  1)  Richard Winters  (Damian Lewis,  urlLink Band of Brothers )   Yeah, you knew this was coming. Thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, lion-hearted leader of men. Kills without question when his country needed it, put it all away for a life of peace when it was all over. Based on a real man - do they make them like that any more?  I'll post my top 10 women characters later on.

      No gym this morning, obviously. This cold is kicking my butt. I'm coughing up chunks of lung.  I woke up to wind and rain; I was happy to get into my nice, dry car in my nice, dry garage. I was not happy to get stuck in traffic for 20 minutes because someone had an accident on the Tennessee river bridge. It especially sucked because of all that coffee I drank.  Now that my commute to work every morning is a bit longer, I need to do something constructive with my drive time. Maybe I'll rent some books on tape or listen to foreign language tapes or something.   Jon just about busted a blood vessel yesterday in dealing with Bell South. We had DSL in the old house and before we even signed a contract Jon talked with them about DSL in the house. He set everything up to have it installed.  Yesterday he called them and they insisted we hadn't set up anything. After chewing on a bunch of asses he finally got a manager on the line and I'm hopeful it's all straightened out. Bell South sucks.  I see the quality of my posts is degenerating. That's because my mind is degenerating - other than some TiVo'd episodes of  Good Eats  I haven't watched anything since last week.  Turner Classic Movies is showing  urlLink The Dirty Dozen  and  urlLink The Great Escape  during the next week or so. I have seen both movies several times but I'll wait until I see them to make comments.  Hey! I just thought of something to write about!  I wish to quote from a review of  urlLink Magnificent Obsession :  "...[T]here are certain films that appeal to one sex particularly, speaking to them at their deepest, baseline level, while leaving the other sex bewildered at their appeal. For men, these films generally entail war, violence, and male bonding under the most extreme of conditions. I’m talking about films like The Great Escape, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, The Dirty Dozen, The Naked Prey, and, in particular, Zulu. These are the movies that men can watch over and over and over, much to the general disgust and bewilderment of their girlfriends and wives. These are films that we watch, nodding along as they speak a seemingly secret language that only we understand.  And what are the women’s movies? They’re bizarre, insane (or so they seem to me, and most men) romantic pictures. ‘Weepies’ they were called at their height of their popularity, or ‘four hanky’ flicks, since the audiences would cry their way through four handkerchiefs. These films, with their ludicrous plot twists and laughable obstacles tossed in the way of final, true love, provided their intended audiences with a ‘good cry.’ They also provided agony to any male dragged along, who dared to mock these films only at risk of life and limb. Men’s Movies bespoke a Code detailing the unwritten rules of what constitutes manly behavior. Conversely, Women’s Films spoke to a separate Code, concerning rules for relationships and emotional involvement that no man ever has, or truly can, understood."  Ken Begg is the proprietor and chief reviewer of  urlLink Jabootu's Bad Movie Dimension  a site I treasure. The quote above is from one of his more inspired reviews. Poor bastard had to watch a chick movie.  Begg notes in his  Magnificent Obsession  review how much everyone has to suffer before true love can be had. This suffering, I suppose, is the distorted idea about the Romantic idea that what is important is the journey, not the destination. This suffering can be viewed as a kind of tempering process; turning the hero (or heroine) into an object worthy of love.  Another aspect of Romantic Art:  Ayn Rand took a whack at explaining art in  urlLink The Romantic Manifesto . I found some of it to be useful and on one thing I agree: both "Guy" movies and "Chick" movies (and books) are the degenerate children of the Romantic movement.  Really. I don't have the book in front of me, but if I recall correctly, Rand defines Romantic Art as art that portrays "Man as he should and ought to be."  So, romantic movies, whether they are 'guy' movies or 'chick' movies, tend to have people getting involved in life-changing situations that turn them into better people - people who are as people should be. That's not a bad definition - you could apply this definition to everything from  urlLink Spider-Man  to  urlLink Die Hard  to  urlLink Say Anything  to  urlLink Sweet Home Alabama .   Generally speaking, the guy changes in the guy movie, and the girl changes in the girl movie, but that's not set in stone. Take  urlLink The Terminator  for instance. Sarah Connor is the one who has to go through hell and changes for the better. Few people would refer to it as a chick movie, or even a romantic movie (although it qualifies as both).  Bad Chick Movies take this process to ridiculous extremes. Here is a movie I truly loathed:  urlLink City of Angels . It epitomized everything that revolts me about chick movies.  A quick synopsis: Angel watches humans, helps them to be on their way when they die. He notices a cute woman doctor and falls in love with her. After invisibly stalking her for a while, he figures out how to become mortal so they can be together. They spend less that 24 hours together making the Beast with 2 Backs. While he's sleeping, she goes bike riding and gets hit by a semi. A little angst about the nature of being human, then The end.  I was hammered when I saw this movie. Fortunately I was at home and not in a theater so I was not arrested when I went postal. As I recall I was screaming at the tv - something about bags of horseshit. Anyway I scared the cats.  Where was I?  Degenerate children of the romantic movement. Yeah. Anyways: Guy movies reflect men the way guys want to be. Rand uses the example of James Bond from  urlLink Dr. No . Dashing ladies man; cultured, suave; cold ruthless killer in the service of his beloved country.   On yet another side note, she complains about how the first Bond movie played it straight then complained about the successive foolishness of the sequels as the movie makers tried to play Bond tongue-in-cheek. I have to agree with her there.  urlLink The Living Daylights , the first of two Timothy Dalton Bond movies, remains one of my favorites because it almost succeeded in cutting out most of that silliness. And Dalton was  hot .  Note that Bond never changes. He is always "Bond. James Bond." (Check out  On Her Majesty's Secret Service  if you want to see a different side of Bond, though).  The Bond movies are an example of bad Guy movies - the character never changes, he just go through episodes of mayhem with the occasional bout of sex with a beautiful woman or three just to prove to the audience he's a confident heterosexual.  Given the choice of a bad guy movie or a bad chick movie, I'll take the bad guy movie every time. If I have to sit through something silly, I'd rather watch guys whup up on each other.  Or to further explain it, my brother and I went to see the Harrison Ford movie  urlLink Regarding Henry . Very much a chick movie, it's about a slick lawyer who gets shot in the head during a convenience store robbery, and the pain he and his family have to go through as he pieces his life back together. The brain injury basically turns him back into a child, and along with it he adopts a child's innocence and honesty (meaning he's a better man for it). As we left the theater, we discussed the movie and we both agreed it left us feeling empty. "What that movie needed," I said, "was some exploding robots."

      Blah. Head cold is now a chest cold. Blah.   Normally I use colds as an excuse to take a day or two of work off to catch up on my sleep (and daytime TV), but between the move and work getting busy I just can't afford the day off.  As for the move, Jon and I are settling in to our new digs. I like the neighborhood more than our last; it's much more quiet and I still haven't spotted a couch on any one's porch. One of our neighbors came by yesterday, introduced herself, and gave us some home-made cookies.  Mmmmmm. Chocolate chip.  We are trying to rent/sell our old house. We have had quite a few calls on it all ready; I am amused as to how many of the calls involved the words "owner financed" and "H.U.D.". I hope we sell, otherwise I'm going to feel like a slumlord.  This morning it was below freezing. I didn't have to go out and start the car early because now we have a 2 car garage. *Heh* I guess I'm officially middle-class now.  We haven't gone to the gym this week. We are planning to go tomorrow. We'll see how that goes; with this darn chest cold I will probably do a light stroll for aerobic activity.  After mentioning Gladiator last post, I was amused to note it was on broadcast TV Monday night. Cut to ribbons, of course. I get a giggle when the crowds start chanting "Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!" because I used to have a Fighter in Dungeons and Dragons whose name was Gluteus Maximus. Hey, to a 17 year-old stoner that was funny!  There was the Paladin Sodium Pentathol, The Druid Alluvial Till, Fundus the Ovarian, the High Priest of the Ithsmus of Ramus (that one wasn't mine but I was duly impressed)....  Sorry. 70's flashbacks can be painful.  Okay, in the "funny to a 17 year-old stoner" department: go to  urlLink this fellow's site  and view some of his work. Particularly the Moon Song. Silly, no? Some of his work just showed up in a Quizno's Sub commercial. Warning: Sound is involved!  His most famous clip involved  urlLink the Viking Kittens . Not only is it a hoot, you will finally learn the lyrics to Led Zeppelin's the Immigrant Song.

      Bah. Still have a cold. After work today I have to work on getting our stuff moved to Hartselle. One good bit of news (for me) - the cable service we're switching to will carry BBC America. Maybe their WB station will carry Angel. One can only hope.  The best thing about Winter is it is a time to look forward to Summer. Namely, Summer movies.   Actually, I was watching the Superbowl last night and I saw the ad for  urlLink Troy . I know most women are going to go to see either Brad Pitt or Orlando Bloom. I like Pitt as an actor and am not really attracted to him. Bloom is a puppy. Eric Bana is playing Prince Hector so I'm there, even though I know my Iliad so I know what happens to him. Kudos to Russell Crowe (another actor I like but am not particularly attracted to) for bringing back Swords & Sandals epics.  urlLink Gladiator  rocked.  My other favorite actors all seem to be in independent movies, which means since I live in East Bumble Alabama I will have to wait until they show up on DVD. Damian Lewis is in one movie that might get main stream release this year:  urlLink An Unfinished Life . Unfortunately, the movie stars Jennifer Lopez so it might get shelved because of all the backlash against her.  And a quick editorial note: I happen to like her as an actor. I really enjoyed  urlLink Out of Sight . And I happen to like Ben Affleck. I'm sorry and embarrassed for both of them. What a fuckarow (thank you, Jason Lee).  Anyway, so that movie might sit and rot on a shelf for a while. Lewis has a small role in it as Lopez' abusive husband. Hoo boy, he gets to mistreat another woman! Fortunately, he's also in  urlLink Brides , about an American photographer that falls in love with a Russian mail order bride (not his) while on board a ship. This is one of those small independent movies that will never make it to the theater, though. Bitch. But, hey! He might actually get to kiss a woman instead of hit her this time! (The woman he kissed in Band of Brothers doesn't count; he was just being polite.)  Everyone else's mainstream work is a year or two away. Most notably, Ewan McGregor reprises his Alec Guinness impersonation for one last time in  urlLink Star Wars Episode III . He gets one independent release before then,  urlLink Young Adam . The American version does not have Full Frontal Ewan in it so I'm hoping they will reinsert (*snerk!*) the footage for the DVD release.  Jason Isaacs will reprise his role as Lucius Malfoy in  urlLink Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  in 2005. In the meantime I will have to hunt down a freaking Canadian release;  New France . On the plus side, Tim Roth will be in it, too. He's been way Missing In Action for too long. Like Isaacs, he tends to get typecast as a bad guy. Last seen monkeying around in Tim Burton's  urlLink Planet of the Apes .  Christian Bale will be in  urlLink Batman: Intimidation  as the caped crusader. All the movie websites are gushing about how great the script is. Apparently someone did push the reset button so we can all safely ignore all previous Batman movies (whew). How spiffy: Michael Caine is playing Alfred - that should be fun! And Cillian Murphy, who had a tackle display in  urlLink 28 Days Later...  is playing one of the bad guys.   Since it won't be released until 2005, I will have to settle for  urlLink The Machinist . I have to dig up a comment by Jennifer Jason Leigh about Bale's diet for this movie.  Of course I'm looking forward to  urlLink Spider-Man II . I'm not a Tobey McGuire fan, but he did a great job in the first movie.   What a wonderfully shallow post. I blame the pseudoephedrine.

      I have a freakin cold! Blah! Tomorrow we're moving 20 minutes down the road to Hartselle. I hate moving. I hate colds. I hate winter time. Blah!   Oh, hey, did the   urlLink map thing  of states visited (thanks, Nancy!):     urlLink create your own visited states map   or  urlLink check out these Google Hacks.    Buffy the Vampire Slayer - from the ridiculous to the sublime    Let's see - I love 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. I started watching it about a year ago and caught up enough just in time to watch it end. Bummer.   When I obsess into anything I tend to research the crap out of it - what the *hell* did I do before the internet? - and Buffy has a massive following, just like the X-Files. As someone who was a huge X-Files fan I deeply appreciate Mutant Enemy striving hard to maintain continuity within the show(s). Of course like any following there's always a group who screams about something. Some people are still sore about season 6. Personally I think some of the best eps came out of season 6 - and some of the worst, I'll agree to that. Loved the musical, the Buffy/Spike snogging, her nerd nemesiseseses, flayed Warren, and Joan the Vampire Slayer. Hated the magic as drugs, the insane asylum, Xander's cold feet, and the return of Riley.   Now I have few and far between women heroes. The ones I do have are precious to me, and I hate the fact that so many of them have had poor endings. Case in point: Ellen Ripley from Alien. As far as I'm concerned, that series ended with Aliens. When they got back to earth, the Company was sued and Ripley, Hicks, and Newt got enough cash to live comfortably and fix Bishop. Ripley married Hicks so they could adopt Newt, and they all lived happily ever after, with no bad dreams. Trite, yes. Better than Alien 3, infinitely!!!   Sorry. Where was I? Wimmin heroes. Clarice Starling. I loved Silence of the Lambs. The book moreso than the movie. Starling was more tough and not so anxious. Her fate in the book Hannibal sucked. I am one of the few people who was glad the movie was made - she might be out of her FBI job, but at least she's her own person at the end of it.   Dana Scully. Kidnapped, made barren, cancer, gets pregnant and has a kid that she can't keep... Argh!   Buffy Summers. A true flawed hero - brave, strong, arrogant, shallow, thinks with her fists more than her head, but always righteously defeats the bad guys. Despite moments of self-pity when it came time to fight, she always did her job. I couldn't ever blame the self-pity: slayers don't have that long of a life span. Her shining moments to me were in season 5 - she defeated a god, fer pete's sake. While I'm not a fan of sacrifice, in this case it was justified. All she did she did for her sister, to a lesser extent her friends, and to a lesser extent the world. She had her priorities straight. Still, I'm not a big fan of self-sacrifice so I'm glad for her resurrection in season 6 as messy as it was. And the season 7 end game Was a kickass ending - she found a way to free herself from her fate without losing her slayer powers.    Gotta admit I'm a Spike fan - he's a remarkable character. Traditionally I hate vampires. They are parasites; I enjoy it every time Buffy slayed one. But with Spike I'll make an exception. He's (was) remarkably evil, but capable of noble acts not all of which can be written of by his crush on the Slayer. Someone (er, something) that is capable of that great a love (twisted that it was) is definitely worth watching - there were many points in the show where Buffy would have been justified in driving a stake in his heart, but he always managed to find a way to keep it from happening. Note I said worth watching, not worth saving or loving back. Plenty of bad shit is done in the world in the name of love - and in this case Mutant Enemy was right in forcing Spike to ultimately save himself: I hated the ep where he tried to rape Buffy (but the ep where they beat the ever living shit out of each other then schtupped the house down is one of my favorites), but he finally figured out that what made him a monster was that huge gap where his soul should have been. So he went on a quest to get his it back. He paid a great price for it and is still paying. I do like the fact that Spike is now whole - he *is* a vampire but his human and demon sides are joined together in something greater than its parts. Very heavy stuff. He is worthy of someone's love now but in any romance traditionally that means - I hate living in East Bumblefuck, Alabama. We don't get Angel here for some reason.   Grr. Argh!

       I was writing  another piece about politics but deleted it after it depressed me too much. Then I read this article that sums up what I was wanting to say:  urlLink What he said.    Jon and I are probably going up to Gatlinburg for vacation this year. The times we have been up there we have enjoyed it. I highly recommend the Ripley's attractions, especially the haunted house and the aquarium. On the whole I'd rather go to the Caribbean again, but we probably won't have the money.   Speaking of, I want to go to Puerto Rico for our next prohibitively expensive vacation. I lived in Puerto Rico from 1967 to 1977 (from when I was 3 to when I was 13) and I'd like to go there to see what I remember. And that brings us to my top 10 list of the day:    Top 10 Good Puerto Rico Memories     10: The ocean was my back yard  When we lived in Isla Verde, which is a tourist strip near San Juan, our apartment building was right there on the beach. Kids do *not* appreciate what they have. I certainly didn't until we moved to Stone Frickin Mountain, Georgia and I couldn't hear the ocean any more.   9: Dad's Sailboat Excursions  I have soooo many fragmented memories of sailboats. I much prefer them to motor boats because the noise is different. Any way my dad had a boat, or boats, or partnerships in boats, or something like that and I loved those trips. I'll have to ask him about those one day.   8: Tropical Storms  The wrath of nature is kewl! The best thing was when it rained so hard the floors of the walkways to the apartments were slippery. Us kids would have built in slip n' slides.   7: Empanadillas, lechon, and bacalaitos  Some people find Puerto Rican food bland. I don't know what they're smoking. Or eating. I love Puerto Rican food! Even Mofongo.   6: My Dad's Wife's Parent's House in Yauco  Dad divorced mom and married a Puerto Rican woman. Yeah, If I have a top 10 list of bad Puerto Rico memories, the divorce is number 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8, and 9. Number 10 - well, we won't talk about that one. Anyhow, Eleana's parents were real nice to us and I feel bad I didn't talk with them much. Do I ever? I was shocked to discover that because I wouldn't talk with anyone I was considered stuck up. Excuse me, are there any SHY hispanics? Hello??? Aparently not.   But I digress yet again: they had a nifty house in Yauco near the ocean. There were cliffs all along the ocean and I'd scale them like Spider-Man all the time.   Oh! I like Eleana. I admire her for putting up with my dad for a quarter of a century. I love my dad, don't get me wrong, but he's a LOT like me. I feel sorry for anyone who marries a Boykin.   5: El Yunque  The tropical rain forest. Not only is it beautiful, it was the only place on the island that is naturally cold. Not *that* cold, but to me it was pretty dang chilly.   4: Sand Forts  Like kids with snow forts. Yes, we had sand ball fights, and some one inevitably ran upstairs screaming because he/she got sand in his/her eyes. *Hah!* None of us got frost bite. You haven't lived until you gouge sand out of every orfice you own.   3: Old San Juan  When I was a kid I was besotted with the ideas of pirates. Arr! Old San Juan was originally enclosed, with a couple of forts guarding the entrance into San Juan Harbor (from pirates! and the English). El Morro and San Cristobal were the two I remember. I got a huge kick out of those places.   2: Climbing palm trees  I could scale one like a monkey. Yes, I climbed anything I could get a grip on.   1: The Ocean  Some people who grew up near the Atlantic don't appreciate warm, clear, tropical waters. Okay it wasn't always warm or clear, but I spent so much time in the ocean it never held any fear for me. I stayed out when the jellyfish would beach themselves, but I never got stung. I knew to stay away from mustard coral and sea urchins. And sharks are not that big a threat where the water is clear. And someone once told me the barracuda chase them off. And barracuda aren't really a threat, either.  Oh, shit. I'm really getting fired up about going there again. I do intellectually realize that after 27 (27?!!? Holy Shite!) years nothing will be the same, but I gotta see.  Oh, all right: #10 bad memory from Puerto Rico: Disco followed me to the states. Yeaargh!

       What  a weekend. We had for the first time this year two perfect days at the drop zone. In total I think we flew 22 loads which is great. Of course, some work has to be done on our King Air's right engine fuel pump now; so much for building that nest egg.  I did 8 jumps; 2 AFF and 6 fun jumps. I need to get on the ball if I want 1,000 jumps before May 17 (43 jumps to go). Many of our younger jumpers (younger in jump numbers, not age) are expressing an interest in formation skydiving so I'm thinking I better have a formation workshop soon. I see them getting in groups that are too big and / or trying out formations that are too difficult for their skill level and it discourages them.  Here is my  urlLink random  link of the week. Mike Rogers is an American who moved to Japan. His mother is Japanese; he has pretty much adopted her native country. His articles are amusing, and sometimes scathing, anecdotes about his adopted country and the one he left behind.  I will warn you that LewRockwell.com is a libertarian site. Many of the contributors are Christian libertarian, which can make anybody's bowtie spin. If you peruse it, just remember these guys won't support any legislation that would outlaw something you like to do because they severely dislike government on general principles.  And as much as I dislike politics, here are 10 random political thoughts:   1:  That Kerry guy... what do you stand for?  2:  That Bush guy... I am very glad that meatpacker Hussein is behind bars. I still don't follow the connection between him and Al-Qaida, though.  3:  Astronaut vs. caveman = definitely the caveman would win in a stand-up fight, but the one astronaut I know isn't stupid enough to stand around and let a caveman bash his head in.  4:  I'd like to smoke pot for my own enjoyment. Too bad it's darn illegal. Pass me a beer, wouldya? Sometimes I think I should smoke on general principles but my athsma wouldn't handle it too well.  5:  Why do people care about the money other people make? Someone is enviously looking at your pockets as I type.  6:  The Free State Project chose New Hampshire. It's COLD up there!   7:  Any political/social system that does not take human nature into account is doomed to failure. That includes my beloved libertarianism, which is why I vote and support a limited government. I *do* feel like I'm paying tribute to the moral equivalent of Tony Soprano, however.  8:  I'm glad I don't live in Georgia any more, because I would feel morally obligated to get my clitoris pierced. Owie.  9:  Which is hypocritical of me because I *do* live in Alabamastan where a vibrator is illegal. Maybe if I leer at the zucchini at the local Farmer's market I can get busted by the cops.  10:  I think I'm beginning to understand why flesh-eating zombies and cannibals fascinate and frighten me so much.  And here's another amusing tid bit: I had a sexually explicit dream last night featuring Spider-Man and Batman. My brain likes to torment me for its own amusement.

       I didn't  write the last two days because I had nothing to say.  But, I *did* see  urlLink Dawn of the Dead  yesterday, so now I do!    Top 10 Reasons Dawn of the Dead kicked ass:     10: The soundtrack  They dug up that old Jim Carroll classic "People who've died" for the closing credits, as well as Disturbed's "Down with the sickness". I own a Disturbed album. I got it because of their re-make of Tears for Fears' "Shout" but I like it nontheless. And "Down with the sickness" rocks. So does Lounge Against the Machine's version of the same song, which makes an appearance about a third of the way through the movie.  The nice thing is they don't overdo it. Most of the time the music is unobtrusive. Sometimes you get a metal soundtrack and the damn thing is so annoying it kicks you out of the movie.   9: Johnny Cash  Maybe I should list him with the soundtrack, but they played "Man Comes Around" over the opening credits. Kewl!   8: Scott Reiniger and Ken Foree cameos  They were two of the actors who appeared in the original. It was a nice touch; Ken got to repeat his famous line about no more room in Hell. Gaylen Ross, who played Fran in the original, didn't want to do a cameo but in honor of her they named one of the stores in the mall after her. I don't know if David Emge made a cameo, or not. I didn't see him credited anywhere.    7:Tom Savini cameo  Tom Savini is 'Da Man' and made a career out of realistic make-up effects. He also has done some acting. He appears here as a sherriff on tv (a nod to  Night of the Living Dead ) explaining that a head shot is the only way to bring a zombie down. It's always kewl to see Savini (last seen as 'Sex Machine' in  From Dusk til Dawn  which owes its pedigree to Romero somewhat, as well).   6: Sarah Polley, Jake Weber and Ving Rhames  They played the leads. The movie had a bunch of people in it and I can't tell you any of their names (except Rhames' cop was named 'Ken' and there was a guy named 'Andy'. More on him later). I have a memory from Hell, anyway. Polley plays a nurse who is obviously scared, but can think on her feet without going into SuperChick mode. Jake Weber has this ordinairy face and plays a concientious, nice guy who tries hard to think straight in a real tough situation. Rhames is a no-nonsense cop who doesn't take charge as much as tries to cope.  Despite minimal character development, these actors did a fine job bringing some distinction to their characters and making us feel for them. Like I said, there's tons of other characters, including an ex-gangsta and his pregnant Russian wife, three security guards from the Mall that everyone flees to (is it my imagination, or do mall security guards get no respect?), and a truckload of zombie fodder. Some of these characters get some character-defining moments, others are just there.    5: Stupid chainsaw tricks  I'll leave it at that. Saying more would be a spoiler.   4: Andy   Across from the Mall is a guy who owns a gunstore who is trapped in his store by himself. He and the mall denizens strike up a long-distance friendship using whiteboards and binoculars. He and Ken especially bond. He is a likable character, and we don't even get to spend much time with him close up. Some of the saddest and most chilling scenes in this movie involve him.  But I'm singling him out because he's a GUN STORE OWNER!! Since when did Hollywood allow a gun store owner to be portrayed as such a likeable person? Don't they have a law against that? Isn't he supposed to be a narrow-minded redneck?   3: Zombie head in the ice chest   Okay, that was a spoiler. But *heh*!   2: It scared me.   Now it wasn't pure horror terror scary, but I was on edge. And yes, I had zombie nightmares. I'm wondering if the Ephedrine I'm taking didn't have some to do with it. It puts me on edge, ups my aggressiveness, and definitely makes me jumpy. I was holding onto my husband's arm pretty tight during this movie. As someone else said, this movie owes as much to James Cameron as to George Romero. This movie reminded me some of  Aliens , especially when our little group decided to get out of Dodge.  You might think I'm touched, but I thank whatever God that exists that I can still have these kinds of reactions to stupid movies. I know it isn't real, but I love the fact that for little chunks of time, I can forget that and just let my emotions take me wherever the movie goes.    1: Zombies! Zombies, zombies, zombies!!!  And they died (again) and in many varied squishy ways. The original  DoD  was ultra-gory and was released un-rated (I was 15 at the time. My sister Andrea and I spent quite a while finding a theater that would let us in). I was surprised (and happy) at the amount of gore this movie had. I'm sure on subsequent viewings I will find out that I imagined much more than I saw. The kewl news is the director has promised to put back what he had to cut out to get an 'R' rating. Nifty!  This movie wasn't perfect, but damn it filled my flesh-eating zombie needs just fine. My biggest nit is they really had no reason to leave the mall. As someone on a forum pointed out, they were in Minne - freaking -sota. The first nasty storm of the winter and you would have nothing but zombie-sickles to walk past. But that's a *small* nit. If people didn't do dumbass things in horror movies, there'd be no movie.  I'd write more, but I actually have to work now. *Whine*.

       Nothing  much to say today.  Tuesday means Back and Biceps day at the gym. I quit taking Albuterol before I run in the mornings - I've had to slow down some but not much. I was running 1.9 miles in 20 minutes now I'm down to 1.7.  Albuterol by the way is for athsma.  I weighed in this morning at 127.4.  I'm happy with that; everything is proceeding as planned, so far.   Boy that was short. Why bother posting anything at all today? Force of habit, I guess.    Top 10 things I found out about since the last time I wrote:   10) My 18 year old cat is stone deaf.  9) There is a  Love Boat - the Movie  in preproduction.  8) Chris Eccleston is slated to be the next Dr. Who.  7) The History Channel will be showing  Band of Brothers  starting on April 17th.  6) The asprin component of the ECA stack may not be neccessary.  5)  Pool of Radiance  may be the most boring Computer Role playing game based on a Dungeons and Dragons rule set.  4) Do not order drugs from Amazon.com.  3) Politics and politicians are still boring and depressing.  2) Repair work to Mobile homes can be expensive.  1) "I think every movie should have at least one flesh-eating zombie." Sarah Polley is my new hero.

       Monday.  Four weeks into the latest diet.  The ECA stack seems to be working; it has curbed my appetite big time. So well I was alarmed on Saturday when I stepped on the scale at 127.2.  Probably just dehydration.  Nothing special about this weekend; did a ground school Saturday and neither student got to jump because of the winds. I did 2 skydives, both fun jumps, and they went real well. One was a 9 point 6-way formation - I don't know if I ever explained that terminology. X - way simply means how many people were on the skydive. So a 6 - way is 6 people. 9 points means we did 9 different formations. Usually we practice four or five different points on the ground, then cycle through them until we run out of time/air.  Heh. What does skydiving and scuba diving have in common? In both sports if you run out of air, you're fucked.  The other dive was a 4-way 14 point formation. Sunday the winds were bad enough to ground me so I did nothing.  So I pigged out on Saturday, did not stay away from beer, and I weighed 131.4 on Sunday. I weighed 129.2 today. I did not Stack over the weekend; the last thing I need to do is do a skydive while under the influence of Ephedrine. I took the stack this morning and headed to the gym.  More humor - in honor of the jokes Nancy posted on her blog:  Why do all the trees in Alabama lean towards Birmingham? Because Alabama sucks!  Okay, that was plenty lame. I'm very fond of my adopted state, although I hate the dry county crap.  Did not watch anything of notice although Sunday I did watch the new South Park episode. As a somtimes Anime fan I laughed my ass off. Parker and Stone even got the ubiquitous and unremarkable Japanese pop song right - along with the occasional  urlLink Engrish  phrase thrown in (although I don't recall ever hearing the phrase 'protect my balls' in a japanese song before). And I'd love to know what those Japanese subtitles were really saying. I'll give it a few days and the translation will show up on the internet.  Yeah, I laugh at Engrish. I also laugh at Cartman's Jew jokes. I'm a bad person.

      Well, hey. The ephedrine killed my appetite. It must be something of a diuretic because I weighed in at 128.6 (I weighed 129.8 yesterday). It also behaves a little like speed, so you get a wandering dissertation from me today:    Zombies    I have made it painfully clear: my favorite monster in the movie world is the mindless, flesh-eating zombie. I make the 'flesh-eating' distinction because in the years BR (Before Romero), movie zombies were simply re-animated corpses that did their master's bidding. When  urlLink Night of the Living Dead  came out, it combined the mindlessness of the zombie with the appetite of a ghoul.  A quick backtrack for a minute: Ghouls traditionally don't feast on the flesh of the living; they feast on other dead bodies. Ghouls typically hang out at cemetaries. A more apt comparison would be a vampire. Vampires need warm, living humans for food but only drink blood. How discrete. Vampires are a wildly popular monster because they can have feelings, personality, and can form attachments to the very people they prey upon. They can also be the unrepentant embodiment of evil, but what it boils down to is they are intelligent.  Zombies however, just are. They are a collection of half-rotted instincts coupled with intense hunger. (Why they are hungry for living flesh is never explained in George Romero's movies; other people have tried to explain it with varying degrees of success). Zombies have no attachments. If your mom or brother or daughter or lover becomes a flesh-eating zombie, it simply doesn't care about you any more. You are food. Don't take it personally.  So George Romero started a new type of movie monster with his flesh-eating zombies.  Night of the Living Dead  gave a half-assed explanation for the reanimation of the recently dead: something about some space radiation from a satellite that re-entered the atmosphere. Besides the horror of cadavers reanimating and shambling slowly towards you, the only way they can be stopped is by destroying the brain. Worse, if you happen to be bit by one of these monstrosities, the resulting infection will kill you and you become one of them.  Romero's zombies are slow-moving and easily stopped; what makes them so nasty is when they show up in large numbers.  NotLD  was the first: a group of survivors hole up in a farm house during the night, trying to figure out what is going on and what to do about it. The little group's downfall is not really from the zombies; it's from their inability to get along and work together.   urlLink Dawn of the Dead  came out in 1979. The violence in this movie is downright pornographic: memorable scenes includes someone's head blowing up from a shotgun blast, a zombie biting chunks of flesh from someone's arm and neck, a bunch of zombies eviscerating a live and concious victim with their bare hands... and I listed this movie as one of my favorites!  Heck yeah, the violence level is part of it. For me it's one impressive magic trick. The effects from this movie are remarkably realistic (not that I've ever seen someone get the top of his head chopped off with a helicopter blade for real). Between some of the most brutal splatter effects in existence, we have yet another rag-tag group of survivors who this time hole up in a shopping mall. Their downfall is trying to hold onto the material goods that they had access to when another group of survivors show up to raid the place.    urlLink Day of the Dead  is considered by many to be Romero's weakest zombie movie. Personally I like this one better than  NotLD  but not by much. The special effects are as brutal as  Dawn 's, and with a slightly larger budget, the make-up team's zombie effects were far more varied and interesting. This time our group of survivors are a group of soldiers and a group of scientists holed up together in an underground military installation. The scientists are trying to find a cause and a cure; the soldiers' discipline is going to hell and they want to get the hell out.  One of the hallmarks of all 3 movies (for me) are relatively realistic people. I could identify with all of them, even the loudmouth jerk in  NotLD . But Romero lost a little by making the soldiers too comic-book rude, offensive, and all-around assholes. But he recovers some in my eyes because the woman in this movie is my favorite. She's a scientist; unlike the (understandably) catatonic Barbara in  NotLD  and the quite pregnant Fran in  DoD  she has more of an interesting role to play.  Oh yeah; once again the downfall of our little group is the inability to cooperate.  Tom Savini, the man responsible for the make-up effects in  Dawn  and  Day  directed a remake of  urlLink Night of the Living Dead  in 1990. Most people consider it far inferior to the original, but I have a soft spot in my skull for it. I don't think the characters are as well developed, although Tony Todd's Ben is as sympathetic as Duane Jones is. And Barbara isn't catatonic for the whole damn film! That was a welcome change although she goes a little too SuperChick for the role. And despite Savini directing, it isn't that gruesome. But hey: it's a zombie movie.  Peter Jackson, beloved director of  Lord or the Rings , cut his teeth on independent movies, including his hommage to Romero's zombies with  urlLink Dead Alive . I say hommage and not ripoff because it is quite firmly planted in Peter Jackson Land. Young Lionel's overbearing mother gets bitten by a Sumatran Rat Monkey and dies from the bite and reanimates as a flesh-eating corpse. Hilarity ensues as Lionel tries to keep the fact that his mother is a zombie away from everyone, including his new girlfriend. There is gore aplently in this movie, including pus-eating incidents, a reanimated set of intestines, random acts of violence against a garden gnome, and quisinarted zombie hands. All with Jackson's trademark sense of humor intact.  Most recently (other than the Dawn remake which comes out today),  urlLink Resident Evil  was inflicted on us zombie lovers.  Resident Evil  was based on a successful series of video games which were loosely based on George Romero's trilogy. It just wasn't that good. Uninteresting characters and not enough gore. Still, I own a copy on DVD. Hey, it has Michelle Rodriguez in it!  The Italians got ahold of  Dawn of the Dead  and went to town. Most notably was  urlLink Zombie , which includes a zombie attacking a shark underwater (shark wins, of course) and a nice closup of a woman's eye being gouged with a wooden splinter. Tons of Italian horror movie ripoffs exist;  urlLink IMDb  on the names Mario Bava and Lucio Fulci for starters. Just don't expect anything too sublime.   urlLink Return of the Living Dead  is a fun riff on the Romero zombies. The zombies in this movie are only interested in brains, can speak (to a certain extent) and are much harder to kill (you don't really kill them; you just hack them up enough so they can't move any more). I never saw the 2 sequels to this movie but I do recommend the first one.  This selection of movies is by no means complete. If you dig around on the web you can find what is reportedly the original script to  Day of the Dead  (completely different than the movie filmed). Plus I haven't even mentioned the amount of fiction, including web-based fan fiction that is set in the Romero universe.  urlLink Homepage of the Dead  is one of my favorite sites for fan fiction and movie news. You know when you have created a phenomena when Stephen King writes fan fiction for your universe.

      Quick note for today:  I think I found a way around the cravings which did hit me hard yesterday. I was able to stay below maintenence calorie-wise, but just barely.  Anyway, the way around: an ECA stack.  ECA stacks are ephedra (or ephedrine), caffeine, and asprin. This 'stack' of chemicals is supposed to be thermogenic; in other words it's supposed to ramp up your metabolism.  I know what you are saying: "Wait a minute - ephedra. Wasn't that banned?" Yep. Ephedra is the herbal variety. Ephedrine is not banned and easily available over the counter in athsma medications.  Most pre-made ECA stacks are no longer available, but I can whip up a homemade one with 2 Primatene tablets, 2 cups of coffee, and half an adult asprin.   Since I have moderate athsma, Ephedrine and I go back a long ways so I don't think the side effects will bother me that much. I also plan not to OVERDOSE, like that idiot baseball player that had heart problems.  By the way, it's not the thermogenic effects that interest me - it's the appetite suppresant effects.

       Arg!   Rough couple of days at work. It feels like I can come up for air for a little bit, though.  Monday night Jon and I went out for dinner. I had blackened catfish, a salad, and steamed veggies, but I still ate more than I had wanted to. Tasty, though.   Tuesday I weighed in at 131.6. Went to the gym, blah blah blah, ate okay, blah blah blah.  Today I weighed in at 130. I'm also starting to experience those really annoying cravings I was talking about. Why?  Is it because of the stress? That could be. Is it because I am pre-menstrual? Very well could be. Is it because I'm in the middle of week 4 and I'm a weenie-head when it comes to willpower? Erm, most likely, yes.  It's going to be a long day.  Speaking of long, we watched  urlLink A Bridge Too Far , a war movie about the ill-fated invasion of Holland in 1944. Quickly, the Allied commanders wanted to figure out a way to end the war before Christmas to they dropped just about everything airborne qualified into Nazi-occupied Holland along this one road that included a bunch of bridges. Each Airborne division was supposed to capture and protect a specific set of bridges. The British had to try to capture and hold the furthest bridge, in Arnhem, which lead over the Rhine. To make a long story short, the British dropped 10,000 and only 2000 came back. The rest were killed or captured.  The movie was pretty tough on the English; I was surprised that Richard Attenborough directed it. For most of its three-hour length I was captivated but it kind of dragged at the end. Interesting cast, including the Usual Suspects: Michael Caine, Anthony Hopkins, Gene Hackman, Robert Redford, Dirk Bogarde, Maximillian Schell, Lawrence Master! Thespian! Olivier, Elliot Gould, James Caan, Sean Connery, etc etc etc.   I was impressed with the special effects; the drop scenes intrigued me - did they get a bunch of airborne troops to actually drop or was some sort of effect used? Pre-CGI movies can be so cool. I thought it was plotted well enough to be able to tell what was happening and to whom. I'd rank this with  The Great Escape  as the best war movie I've seen lately.  I also saw the first 10 minutes of  urlLink Dawn of the Dead , the remake. USA was kind enough to show it during  Final Destination  which I didn't bother to watch.   There's a lot of word wars going on about DoD and its remake; I was not interested about any remake of perhaps the finest flesh-eating zombie movie in existence. I keep hearing decent to good things about the remake, however; and the first 10 minutes I saw pretty much sealed my decision to go see it.  The new version's scriptwriter changed some rules (was he influenced by  28 Days Later.. ? I don't care). The zombies, at least the freshly animated ones, are fast. They also reanimate not too soon after death. Some people bitched about the changes, I think they're neat. The first 10 minutes introduces us to a nurse who goes home one evening to her husband and wakes up to a really messed-up world. First a reanimated next-door-neighbor's kid shows up in their house and takes a chunk out of her husband's neck. He bleeds to death while the nurse desperately tries to get through to 911 services. He pops up maybe a minute after biting it and tries to bite her. She manages to escape outside and gets in her car and sees all kinds of messed up crap going on outside.  I had that delighted* sense of dread and terror I only get with certain horror movies, so I have high hopes for the rest of the film. Oh! I also had a nightmare about it last night. Too cool. I never get nightmares from movies except those about flesh-eating zombies.  *As opposed to that suck-assed sense of dread and terror that happens when you are about to be in a car accident or a really big crazy guy starts picking on you or you throw out your pilot chute and nothing happens or the current is too strong for your swimming skills or...

      Oh, yeah!  Two new links over there--------------------->  Finally got around to posting a permanent link to James Lileks' blog; plus I just found Alton Brown's.

       I had  a pretty interesting weekend.   On Saturday I got up, did a 2.25 mile run in Sparkman Park. Along the way I named the park's resident wildlife (9-10 cats; they look like they are cared for). It was my first official 'cheat' day so I did some calculations and made my dinner. It was basically chicken and rice - I had forgotten just how much rice is produced from 1 cup of dry long grain. It had some spices in it like garlic and turmeric.  The ground school was uneventful - only one person and he was fairly heads up so his first jump was not eventful. I did one other jump on Saturday, a coach jump with a woman who hadn't jumped since November.  What made Saturday fairly interesting was I met  Brian Germain , who came down to teach a course in canopy control. I wanted to attend, but I had the ground school. Mr. Germain is a big name in skydiving; I tried to find an appropriate analogy - it's not like meeting Oliver or Wilbur Wright, maybe more like meeting Chuck Yeager but Yeager I don't think designs airplanes.   Nice guy. Awful cute, too; damn shame there's no picture of his face on his website. I let him jump my Sabre 120 (he didn't bring his own gear). Wish I landed my canopy that gracefully.  Saturday night, after I drank some liquid courage, I got to talk to him about a bunch of things. I don't get starry-eyed when meeting someone famous, but a well-known name (coupled with good looks) can intimidate me. I really wish I could have taken the class. I have his textbook which I plan to devour during the week.  I did two jumps Sunday - even though I planned and executed a cheat day, I really need to stay away from the beer. I just don't feel good the next day. The second jump was the nicest formation skydive I have done in a long time - 19 points - but the weather was moving in and even though we could see the ground we were pelted by ice. That *stings*.  Sunday night Jon invited Steve (camera man and friend) over as well as Brian. So I got to cook for 4 people again. I am proud of my cooking skills so I was glad I could do something nice for them (I made Thai Chicken though I was beside myself at the supermarket because I couldn't find any fresh basil). Brian is a cat person and even Big Fat Kitty made an appearance and let himself get petted and loved on.  I'd like to say we ate dinner and had witty conversation around the table but no - Jon has a bunch of  South Park  episodes on TiVo so we watched them. I'm with Butters: I'd rather be a crying little pussy than a faggy Goth kid.  Enough of my social life: what about the diet?  I weighed in at 129.2 Saturday Morning. Sunday morning I clocked in at 134.6.  Pretty good, eh? 4.2 pounds! How the hell much did I eat Saturday?!!?  Not that much, actually. About 2300 calories and that's a generous estimate. If I'm right about my maintenence level, that's about 600-700 calories over maintenence. The massive weight gain is all the water I retained when the carbs I ate were stored as glycogen in my liver and muscles. This was my plan, remember. I did fairly well and stayed away from fat (except for the cheese on the pizza I ate) so I'm fairly sure  that very little of what I ate was added on as fat.  But the proof will be in what I weigh once I re-deplete my glycogen stores. Sunday I did no exercise (except the skydiving) but I jumped right back on the lowcarb horse and (this is important) No Cravings! Wierdly, I ate about 680 calories all told yesterday but I did not feel like eating more (I should have).  Today I still weighed 134.6 and I went to the gym and ran 2 miles and did Squats (3 sets 17 reps 75 lbs), Stiff-legged deadlifts (3 sets 17 reps 75 lbs) and seated calf raises (3 sets 10 reps 70 lbs). Why such high reps w/the leg exercises? It's supposed to be good for endurance as well as weight loss. While there's no such thing as spot reduction, resistance training does ramp up the metabolism better than cardio because apparently the protein synthesis that goes on afterwards is energy intensive.  Or so I've been told.  Oh: I went on a bagel hunt on the way to the drop zone Saturday morning and here's a sad fact: I can't swing a dead cat without hitting a gas station/store that sells Krispy Kreme donuts, but I can't find any place that sells single, fresh, bagels! Alabama is so backwards about some things. No, I did not have any of those tender morsels of fried sugar, I wanted a damn bagel! *Sigh*. Next refeed, if I can find a supply.

       Eeeyarg.  I'd say something stoopid like thank Mannanan MacLlyr it's Friday, but I have a ground school to teach at the drop zone tomorrow morning. Ah, well, it's money; and it will help me forget about food.  I'm not having cravings yet, but I'm definitely feeling hunger more. My Shoulders and Legs workout went fine; matter of fact I felt pretty strong on my Squats and Stiff-Legged Deadlifts.   I woke up a little tired; I did not sleep as deeply as I would have liked. I also got to bed late because hubby and I stayed up to watch  urlLink Planet of the Apes , Tim Burton's version.  I didn't like it. The ape makeup was good, and I liked the cast. Not only did we get Marky Mark, Helena Bonham-Carter and Micheal Clarke Duncan, I was delighted to see Paul Giamatti, David Warner, and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa listed in the cast. And ex-listee Tim Roth as the Evil Bad Guy. Monkey. Ape. Whatever. I had to go by voices to figure out who was who.  The ending just sucked and the script felt like it was being made up as they were going along. Some of the ape roled were developed but the humans were pretty one-dimensional. Speaking of apes, Helena Bonham-Carter's Chimp was a hoot. She played a human-rights spoiled daughter of a senator; but she had the hots for Mark Wahlberg. Of course, I was smirking and making bestiality jokes; but is love among intelligent, adult, consentual species so wrong? Still, I kept expecting her to pinch his butt.  Which brings me to another complaint about the movie. In the original Chuck Heston paraded around in a loincloth the vast majority of the film (Mr. Heston had a cameo here, as Tim Roth's dad. My favorite scene). Marky Mark stays fully clothed, and I have seen his nekkid bod and he has nothing to be ashamed of. I want to pinch his butt.  And to natter about other movie news, the new  Batman  movie is actually filming, which is great news. Getting past preproduction is sometimes the biggest hurdle. And the casting news is great; besides Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, and Cillian Murphy, they have hired Wanatabe Ken to play the bad guy. Also, rumor has it that Listee Guy Pearce will make an appearance as Harvey Dent. Ooooo! I just love it when I get 2 Listees for the price of one! Harvey Dent eventually becomes the villain Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones in one of the previous batman films. Two-Face is actually a compelling villain; he wakes up every morning and flips a coin to figure out if he's going to be evil or good that day. Jones's Two-Face just sucked, however.  Since Christopher Nolan seems to be receiving my telepathic messages, how about casting Ewan MacGregor as the Joker? Man, I wish I could post photos. He has that predatory grin. How about my beloved flame-headed Damian Lewis as the Riddler? Frank Gorshin was the tops here, and Jim Carrey blew chunks, but still. Can't think of whom Ralph Fiennes could play but I'm sure you could find him something to do!

       Ah, Thursdays.  Other than my rotator cuff exercises, I get to goof off and not exercise. Tomorrow is shoulders and legs days, the most draining day of the week.  All I (should) do on Saturday is a long run, and Sundays are for goofing. Now that it's getting warmer, I'll be working at the drop zone more on the weekends and that isn't goofing off and it helps me from getting preoccupied with food.  Speaking of food preoccupation: I clocked in at 129.4 pounds this morning. So see, my Sunday night cheat didn't hurt me; I'm still steadily losing.  When I started, I weighed 136. From what I have seen, I lose about 3 pounds of water weight when I eat low carb so I have lost about 3.6 pounds in the last 2 1/2 weeks. That's quite acceptable.  I am contemplating moving my refeed period from Sunday to Saturday night. Saturday night is party time at the drop zone and everybody who hangs around either goes out to eat as a group or orders pizza. Starting the refeed then would allow me to be with them.  Of course the big problem is the food is high fat plus there's plenty of beer around.  Heck, I'll give it a try and see what happens.   Sunday morning I'll have that bagel then I'll get back on the diet hamster wheel.  Sometimes I have to go out of the way and create a more interesting meal than my usual chicken thigh and broccoli dinners. Last night, I made tacos. When I do this I am far more careful with calories counting.  1 lb 7% fat ground turkey 6 oz. diced onion 3 cloves crushed garlic 1 can Ro-Tel diced tomatoes and peppers Chili Powder ground cumin cayenne pepper (or Sriracha sauce or chili garlic paste mmmmmmm)  Brown the turkey; put the onions and garlic in with the turkey while it's browning. If too much water accumulates, spoon some of it out. It doesn't have to be bone dry. add the spices to taste then dump the can (undrained) in there. Add a little water or beef stock if it's too dry. Stir, let it simmer for about 10-15 minutes uncovered, stir occasionally. Let most of the liquid evaporate. (the spices seem to incorportate better if you have at least a little liquid in the beginning).  Now, if you want to go low-low cal and low carb, make a taco salad, I.E. in a bowl put a bunch of shredded lettuce and about an ounce of shredded Monterey Jack or whatever cheese then about 1/4th of this mixture. Add jalepenos and/or salsa (Pace is my favorite) Last night I used 2 low carb tortillas. I also had to use ground chuck because I couldn't find 7% turkey - the gound turkey breast tastes like sawdust to me and the %15 actually has more calories than the chuck.  Anyway, my total damage for that meal was around 540 calories (bringing my total for the day to just under 1,000). I felt pretty stuffed. And meals like this  feel  like cheating.  Oh, as I continue with my dieting monomania, have I ranted about the When You Eat myth? I used to think that if you stopped eating at like say 5pm, you would lose more weight. Horse poop, if you are eating the same amount of calories as you normally would. If you stop eating at 5pm because that makes you eat less, then yes it works. It does not matter when you eat! If you eat less calories than you burn, you will lose weight.  I was thinking of one aspect of dieting: cravings.   Right now, since it's Thursday, I am feeling some effects of having eaten hypocalorically for the last 4 days. It isn't bad; I feel just a little thready but it isn't hunger. I can think of all kinds of foods and wish I had some but it isn't a true craving. I am not staring at my lunch and drooling. 11 am will come around soon enough. I love this feeling; it means I am handling not eating.  So what causes those cravings? Soon enough, maybe tomorrow, maybe in a few weeks, my brain is going to start talking to me about the Oreos in the snack machine. I will point out that I have no change, and brain will urge me to go search the car. Or go out to the gas station and get $20 out of the ATM. And since I'm at the gas station why don't I pick up some Gardetto's or some beef jerky, since I like those better than Oreos? We can't break the diet I'll say. Brain will say, it's only 250 extra calories, that won't do much damage.  But since I love oreos, once I get back from the gas station and chow on whatever I have bought, I'll be thinking about the extra change in my pockets from that $20 I cashed. Before I know it, the next 3 days will have me spending that $20 all on food which might include 1 or 2 visits to MacDonald's for a Quarter Pounder, large Fry, and a big-assed Dr. Pepper.  I'm so happy all these ideas repulse me right now, but the cravings are coming. They always do.  What causes them? Psychologically, it's probably that we want what we can't have. Human nature. Physiologically, it's probably your body telling you to eat something already, we're starving. Women get a double-whammy because of monthly hormone fluctuations.  I'm hoping the refeed will counterract the cravings, or at least leave them controllable. Hah! We'll see.

       If it's Wednesday  it must be Chest and Triceps day. My 20 minute run felt good; I'm still not doing a full 2 miles but I am getting better (1.86 miles today). As for the weight training, all of my exercises have been at 3 sets of 12 reps. Next week I'm going to up weight and do 3 sets of 10 reps.  I had started a periodization cycle earlier this year, but the move threw me off. I feel like I'm back in the groove and the diet thingy feels under control, so it's time to start aiming for a little progress in the strength corner.  And little progress it will be, because I'm trying to lose weight. I won't be able to gain muscle while I'm trying to lose fat. It doesn't mean I can't improve my strength, though. Just not that much.  And hey, stepped on the scale:129.8 pounds. Yay! I got past the arbitrarily annoying 130 mark! I'm aiming for the arbitrary 120 mark. 9.8 pounds to go, and 68 days to achieve it (that's my 40th birthday, and that will mark the beginning of my 2 weeks off the diet. AND on that day, I will eat nothing but chocolate cake and drink Irish red Ale! Home brewed, of course. Then I will throw up in front of my friends and embarrass myself. Man, I can't wait!!)  That reminds me...  I've been wanting to regurgitate some of what I have been reading about diets.  First off, all diets in the long run are bad for you. If you eat hypocalorically (in other words, if you eat less than you need to function), you will eventually use up all of your energy stores and you will die. Just ask Karen Carpenter.  All diets are also bad for you because you will not be getting all the nutrients you need. This problem can be side-stepped somewhat by taking a cheap multivitamin.  All diets are also bad for you because since your body thinks it's starving, it will start shutting things down, like your metabolism and your sex drive. 5% bodyfat looks cool, but your body hates it.   And to quote  urlLink Lyle MacDonald , your body hates you.  Most of what I have learned about ketogenic diets I learned from his book on the subject. Much of what I'll write below came from his book.   Your body doesn't really hate you, it loves you and wants to keep you alive as long as possible. Our bodies have not adapted to the modern diet; indeed it responds to food much in the same way the bodies of our ancestors responded. Because of an uncertain supply of food, our ancestor's bodies stored energy efficiently.   Namely, it is a natural adaptation to put fat on easily (fat is a great storage unit for energy; one pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories, 1 - 2 days worth of energy) and to take it off grudgingly. The fitness models on TV might look hot, but take one of them and an overweight blob and lock both of them away, the fitness model will die of starvation MONTHS before the lardbutt does.  Our bodies are pretty easygoing about energy: it will burn the fuel it has greatest access to. The reason we are getting so bigassed is because we eat so much the body is shunting the fat we eat into fat stores while dumping insulin into our bloodstream to handle all the glucose from the carbohydrates we eat. More on insulin in a bit.  Low fat diets work (if they are hypocaloric) because your body isn't busy storing fat any more because you aren't really eating it. Matter of fact once the carbohydrates are out of your system (carbs are pure energy - one gram of carbohydrate will convert to one gram of glucose), your body will then reach in to its fat stores for food. Your tissues don't care; they will burn fat as easily as glucose.  The one exception is your brain and central nervous system. It needs glucose. It was once thought that that was all it burned, but (again, thought to be an adaptation), it can change over to burning about 75% ketones, which is an energy source derived from fatty acids. I forget how the body does this, but trust me. Ketones are produced from fatty acids and after a few weeks of little or no carbs your brain will reluctantly start using them for fuel.  So what does your brain do in the meantime? Your body will break down muscle tissue. When your body gets ahold of protein, 58 percent is turned into glucose. This is why you lose muscle when you diet and it is also why you should not shirk on protein when you diet!  Low carb diets work (if they are hypocaloric) for pretty much the same reason that low fat diets work. After burning the food you eat your body dips into its fat stores for the energy it needs.  So, if you want to lose weight, go hypocaloric. Low fat (Weight Watchers), Low Carb (Atkins), or balanced (the Zone), it doesn't really matter except to how you respond to the diet.  Here is my problem with low fat, which I have done: A certain level of protein is neccessary. I am happy with about .8-1  gram of protein per pound of bodyweight, so I'm eating about 400 -600 calories in protein a day. (1 gram of protein = 4 calories). If I'm eating low fat (say about 10% -%20 of my diet, or about 100-200 calories: 1 gram of fat = 9 calories ) I'm only eating about 10 - 20 grams of fat. That's not much - less if you are accounting for the fat from the meat you are eating. So the rest, maybe about 500 -700 calories is coming from carbohydrates (1 gram = 4 calories, or about 120 grams of carbs a day).  Are you with me, or are your eyes crossing?  My problem is this: mood swings and cravings. I did not know I had these until I tried low carbohydrate dieting. When I tried low fat, I'd have a meal like a chicken breast and some plain white rice and maybe a salad with just vinegar for dressing. The rice would cause my low blood sugar to spike - instant mood swing. I would also crave more (happens after an insulin crash). A half a cup of rice just sucks, and that's about all I was allowed to have at one meal.  The theory about insulin spikes and crashes is this: Insulin regulates the level of blood sugar. More sugar (glucose) in your bloodstream will cause your body to dump insulin into your system. Overeating carbs will eventually cause you to become insulin resistant. In other words, your body will dump more and more insulin into your system in response to the same amount of carbs. That overexcess of insulin will lead to a crash, or your blood sugar will go too low. In some people this crash can cause sugar cravings.  So I tried Low Carb. Same protein levels - matter of fact I'm being more careful with them now that I have learned about how eating too little protein can cause you to lose muscle. Carbs are reduced to about 80-100 calories a day (20-30 carbs) except on workout days when I'll eat about 60 carbs all told. That ain't much but I can go to town on vegetables. Since veggies are so tough for your body to digest, I don't get the insulin spikes like I would with potatoes, bread, pasta, or rice. The rest of my diet is fat. 500-600 calories of delicious, yummy fat!  I eat fattier cuts of meat (sometimes), use butter in my cooking, and eat real salad dressings. It's not much, granted (about 60 grams of fat), but I feel full and no mood swings. And I get to eat cheese! Mmmmmmmmmmm, cheese!  Logic would tell you, "hey, why don't I combine the two? I will do lower fat, but ALL my carbs will be veggies!" That's the Zone diet (kinda); it felt to me like I was grazing. Hey, if it works for you, do it! I tried but got tired of all that food prepping. Screw it, gimme a stick of string cheese.  Any way, I don't get spikes or crashes because there's just not that much glucose to react to. No peaks and valleys, no cravings. I feel level-headed and more alert.  Some people feel stupid on a low carb diet. This is because their brains have not adapted. For maybe two or three weeks it might be a good idea to eat a little more carbohydrates. Some people never seem to adapt. And athletes and heavy exercisers suffer under a low carb plan because their muscles don't have access to glycogen (I talked about that yesterday).  So, instead of going from one diet fad to another, everyone should get more informed about basic nutrition then try things out to find the best thing suited for them. If one thing doesn't work, try another. I bitch about the hamster wheel - all in all it looks like my on again-off again dieting hasn't worked. I think it has, to a certain extent. I fall off the wagon and consume like crazy - this habit seems to be caused by stress. Moving didn't help, of course. Finally things get calmed down and I try again and have some success for a while.  I'm saying it was somewhat successfull because if during these past 3 years I ate like I normally did I would have levelled out weight-wise at about 145 (or maybe more. That was my high water mark when I was 31).  I'm thinking the trick is to make observations about my habits and cycles. If I can find the patterns maybe I can find a way to counteract the wagon-falling.  This time around, I think an occasional  planned  refeed followed by a  planned  break after 8-10 weeks might help me take control. Cravings are bizarre; sometimes I  just want to eat! . So why not plan it? We'll see...

       Did you  ever wake up early in the morning, and drift in and out of sleep for what seems like forever? I spent like two days in between the hours of 2 and 4 this morning. Sleep time like that is odd.  So I woke up, weighed myself - 131.2 - ooOOooh! 1.2 pounds lighter than yesterday. Before I go into a diatribe, I wanted to post something Lyle MacDonald said on his website recently:   This whole neurosis reminds me of the hangups folks have about either refeeds or taking 1-2 weeks off of their diet to upregulate metabolism. They are so concerned with the short-term changes that they lose sight of the big picture. Yeah, fine, maybe you gain a little bit of fat back during 2 weeks off the diet. If it means that the next 6-8 week diet cycle works that much better (compared to taking time off), you still end up better off in the long-run.   When you diet, it is a good thing to do refeeds (which simply means eating normally, NOT pigging out) maybe once every 1 -2 weeks, depending on how you feel. Then it's a good idea to take a week or two off every couple of months. Doing this will help keep your body from wrecking its metabolism.  I'm bringing this up because I felt great in the gym this morning (back and biceps). I mentioned being tired last week. What was the difference? I'm wondering if it wasn't because I cheated Sunday. I didn't cheat bad; all in all I ate about 2000 calories worth of food. Well, 1/2 of that was beer. Beer still has carbohydrates in it, which my body is either burning or storing as glycogen at this point. Glycogen is a fuel reserve stored in the liver and muscles (and every part glycogen bonds with 4 parts water, which explains how I magically gained 2.6 pounds and lost 1.2 all in the space of 2 days, more or less) and is burned as fuel when the bloodstream has nothing left in it from eating. Weightlifting is especially good at depleting glycogen stores.  So what the hell am I saying? I'm saying I'm thinking that going ahead and setting aside Sunday as a refeed day. As best as I can tell, I average burning about 1700 calories in a day. I'll try to do a switchover - instead of low carb, I'll make it high carb/lean protein/ very little fat. I'll probably eat a little more than 1700. That way the extra carbs will be stored predominantly as glycogen and I'll have a bit more oomph during the week in the gym. It will also tell my body "hey, just kidding, we're not starving so don't shut my metabolism down!"  This cycle, incidentally, is referred to a cyclical ketogenic diet.  Boy, I'll do anything to justify a bagel. Bagels, mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.

       Not much  of a weekend to write about. I was tired Saturday. So much I spent most of it asleep. I don't know if it was from overtraining, diet, or the pills I take occasionally for muscle spasms in my back. Most likely a combination of both.  I broke my 5th thoracic vertabrae in a car wreck when I was 15 years old. The muscles near that area on my left side sometimes spasm. Sometimes I need something stronger than Vitamin I to tamp down the pain. (That's Ibuprofen, by the way). The meds wash me out, though.  So I did not do any running Saturday. Sometimes its best to listen to your body. And all that sleep felt gooooood.  Sunday I awoke with a lot more energy, but the wind was gusty so I sat out at the drop zone and watched a lot of idiots land their parachutes. No one got hurt, thank goodness. I'm sorry, but if your canopy is undulating like a jellyfish, maybe it's best to go home and play computer games.    urlLink James Lileks  is my soul brother. I wish I had half his talent. Here is something he wrote in Monday's bleat:    And so to Alien 3 . . . which begins with one of the greatest blunders every made in sequel history, right alongside some Paramount executive who said “Sure, let Shatner direct the next one. How bad could it be.” The third Alien movie begins by breaking your heart. It’s cruel. Anyone who had anything invested in the characters is instantly angered by the movie. Not by the story; not by the plot. By the movie itself. I don’t think it ever recovers.    I was so angry after the first 5 minutes of Alien 3 I found it impossible to enjoy the rest of the movie. Was it good? I have no idea.    Like  I said earlier, I'm back on the diet hamsterwheel. I have been for the last 2 weeks. Let's go back in time to my first post from November:   Rule 1:   Weight loss is a matter of physics. You have to eat less calories than your body expends in a day. That part hasn't changed, no matter who claims what.   Yep, this rule still applies. I'm eating below 1200, (around 1000) which is supposed to be a no-no, but it seems more effective. I don't know how much muscle mass I've lost, if any; I'm still doing the same exercises at the same reps in the gym so we'll see if this rate is too drastic.    Rule 2:   A reduced carbohydrate diet is better than a reduced fat diet.   I have come to decide that the best diet in the world is the diet that works for you without compromising your health. That said, I still prefer low carb to low fat (though I seem to be doing a combo of the two).    Rule 3:   Diets can be boring. Deal with it.   I'm dealing. I have never really had a problem here, anyways. I can go into 'feed the machine' mode and not worry about boring meals and eat the same thing day in day out. My husband, on the other hand, will bitch.   Rule 4:   Tupperware (in the generic sense; that stuff's expensive)!   Stupid rule but it still applies. I love that cheap stuff in the supermarkets. When we moved I think I ended up with two large boxes of plastic containers.   Rule 5:   Don't get obsessed by the scale.   Yep, I violate this one. Step on it every morning.    Rule 6:   There is no rule 6.   There is still no rule 6. I don't care one way or another about poofters, though.   Rule 7:   keep a log of what you eat.    I stick to this one. I'm not obsessing about macronutrient quantities this time around; I'm careful about the protein and the fats. Most if not all the carbs I'm eating are veggies and I simply estimate the calories from them. I have decided that there's nothing wrong with frozen veggies especially for things like curries and stir fries. They don't rot in the vegetable bin, for one thing.   Rule 8:   Keep temptations away from you.   *Sigh* this rule can never be broken when it comes to beer. Jon brought some beer and some friends home last night. Yep, I had some. Too much. On top of a low carbohydrate, hypocaloric diet. So on top of a good hangover, the scale wasn't kind to my bloated butt.  It also makes the gym fun. I didn't have any problems endurance-wise this morning, but I was feeling a little pukey during the last reps of my last squat set.   Two weeks ago I weighed 136. Saturday I weighed 130.6. This morning I weighed 133.4. -  2.8 pounds of water weight packed back on. I know what it is but I'm stupid enough to let it affect me emotionally.  So on top of me nattering on about weight training and movies, you now will get to hear me obsess about my weight. I just want the cottage cheese butt to go!

       My Friday  workout went well. During the shoulders exercises I felt tired more than usual. That feeling worried me; I was afraid I'm not eating enough. But then I did my leg exercises and felt stronger than ever. So the dieting thing is in a 'so far, so good' mode. I'll write more about the diet, my progress, and the rules I'm violating Monday.  After all that Army talk, I wanted mention Kitchen Patrol. Most soldiers hate KP. Why? I went through basic in South Carolina in February, March, and early April. It was quite chilly. KP meant I got to be warm *all day* in a tiny building jam-packed with food. So I had to scrub a few pots and peel a few potatoes. The Army motto is 'don't be first, don't be last, never volunteer' and for the most part that's true. But I'd volunteer for KP any day.  I dug through my laser disc collection last night and Jon and I settled for an Arnold Swarzenegger movie:  urlLink Total Recall . Released in 1990, one of its amusements is leftover 80's hair. I miss 80's action movies; they are far more violent.   Arnold plays a construction worker who pays to have memories of a vacation on Mars implanted in his head. He buys the 'extra-special' package, which instead of a standard stay-at-a-hotel, buy the tee-shirt style vacation, he has an action-adventure style Mars story implanted. The implant goes wrong, and it triggers memories about mars which leads to an action-adventure trip to Mars. The mindjob here is is he really involved in intrigue on Mars, or is he in the middle of a paranoid delusion?  This movie would have been more interesting if it had messed with the is he/isn't he on Mars aspect more; I'm sure since Arnold was in it that part of the script was de-emphasized. It was based on a Philip K. Dick story, a man who specialized in mindjob stories.  Michael Ironside, a canadian actor that specializes in Evil Bad Guys doesn't slack off in this movie. He, Lance Henriksen, Clancy Brown, J.T. Walsh (r.i.p.), David Warner, and a handful of other actors are (for me) good actors who get typecast in small roles, usually bad guys, but are always fun to watch. Ah. There's a good top 10 list to work on...

       I  bet you're wondering ( or maybe not) what triggered these basic training memories. It wasn't all the war movies I've been watching; it was because I heard U2's  One Tree Hill  on the radio recently. I don't know why, but that did it.  I did some research yesterday; read some online diaries of people who went through basic and it helped me remember some things. Like I said, my memory isn't linear; here are some general impressions and feelings I had during boot camp:  Eating a full meal, including dessert, in less than two minutes flat. I still have to think about it so I can slow down and enjoy the food I eat.  Standing at attention, or parade rest in formation every morning in March and April with my feet so cold in my boots, my toes felt like someone had put marbles in my socks.  "Yes, Drill Sargeant! No Drill Sargeant!" Marching. Cadences. Polishing my boots, cleaning my M-16. Rain dripping off my too-short poncho into my boots. Waiting, waiting, waiting. And getting into the front leaning rest position, of course, and doing pushups. Devouring the Sunday paper because that's the only time I got to read anything. Getting up in the middle of the night to pull fireguard for two hours.  Speaking of, I was walking back from mess one sunday and I stopped to buy the Sunday paper; my jaw dropped the floor as I read about the Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker scandal. I stood there so long in front of the vending machine a drill sargeant walking by dropped me for pushups for loitering.   Anyway, the three phases of Basic Training are called the Red, White, and Blue phase. I told you about the Red phase. And I knew my memory was out of kilter; we did no bayonet training until the White phase. This phase dealt with learning to shoot.  My dad taught me how to shoot so I felt/feel comfortable with a rifle (not a gun). I shot competently but not as good as I probably could have because I tend to choke under a time limit. Some of us got to ride home from the range in a helicopter when we qualified on our rifles. That was kewl! I enjoyed this phase much more than the drill and ceremony stuff.   I don't remember the cutoff point, but somewhere along the line between the White and the Blue phase we learned other aspects of basic soldiering. Throwing grenades, using grenade launchers, using LAW rockets and Claymores... I was a kid in a candy shop! In the Blue phase we started bivouacing (sp?) outdoors. Marching some place, setting up a pup tent; I remember sitting in the tent with Mitchell and helping each other remove that camouflage make-up. We cleaned each other's face using baby ass wipes.   Don't laugh! Any one who's done any camping knows baby ass wipes are the key to survival, especially if you're a woman!  Any way, each skill we learned was conducted at a different range. Each range was named after a famous U.S. Army battle. This factoid brings me to the Chipyong-ni breakdance. Chipyong-ni was a battle in the Korean war. This particular range consisted of sawdust pits where we learned the high crawl and the low crawl. The high crawl basically consists of slithering on the ground on your belly, only using your elbows. The low crawl is lower than that. If you aren't making a furrow with your helmet, you aren't lowcrawling. This range was miserable. I hated it even more than the gas chamber.  I was picking sawdust out of personal holes for something like two months after that.  The most fun I had during basic was during this one range where we had to tie together all the skills we had learned. My buddy and I had to silently advance and cover each other until the enemy started shooting (popup targets w/ blanks). At that point we had to switch over to verbal communications; one person would advance ("I'm up, I'm moving, he's aiming, I'm down") while the other person covered  with live ammo.   Our objective was to get close enough to this concrete bunker to throw (fake) hand grenades.   Thank god I trusted Mitchell. While waiting in line to run this range, I was grinning like an idiot and I told Mitch to pretend we were in a war movie. I really felt like I was 7 years old again. We put our hearts into it; when the enemy opened up we were screaming like banshees. We got big-assed GO's on that range (everything is graded Go/No Go). The sargeant in charge of grading congradulated us, and commended us for not getting flustered because some brass were watching ( a Colonel and a few others). Mitchell and I never saw anyone - guess that's a good thing.  From what I have read, the very end of basic has changed somewhat. I recall going through something called the 'superbowl', where we were rated individually or with your buddy on certain skills. I remember a long, fun discussion with one rater, a particularly tough drill sargeant, while setting up a claymore mine (a dummy, of course). I'm not being sarcastic, he just felt like talking and so I listened as I set the thing up, responding "yes, drill sargeant, no drill sargeant" where appropriate.   That's pretty much it - I haven't talked about the drill sargeants much because none of them were of the R. Lee Ermey variety. They were tough, but fair. Our platoon had Drill Sargeant Simon and Drill Sargeant Daniels, I recall. I remember one Sunday morning I had Battalion CQ with another soldier who I became good friends with. Her name was Susan Cohen and she was half chinese and half jewish. I'm not kidding. She was constantly getting in trouble for talking too much. Many of the other soldiers didn't like her but we got along well.  Any way, that Sunday at Battalion headquarters (CQ means 'Charge of Quarters', just means you answer the phone if it rings), Susan and I sat around and twiddled our thumbs. Drill Sargeant Daniels was on battalion CQ, too; he was studying for a math class he was taking. He was having trouble with a problem; I recongized it as a quadratic equation so I took some time reviewing with him how to set the problem up correctly. He knew how to solve it; he just didn't remember how to make it look like a quadratic equation, if that makes sense.  Any way, from that point on, I never got into trouble w/ Drill Sargeant Daniels. I remember goofing off with Susan on a range during lunch; DS Daniels walked by, dropped Susan and never even looked at me. I got the hint and wandered off.  The truth is the Army is easy to deal with. It's not easy and it's not super-hard. I am proud I got through basic, but I got through it because I learned pretty quick: just do what you're told.

      What a difference a good night of sleep makes! I feel much better today than I did yesterday. I had a good time at the gym (Chest and Triceps). Because my shoulder is better I went ahead and did weight-assisted dips but at a pretty high weight to take it easy.   So far, so good.  Jon wants in on the diet thing, too. I guess both of us want to not look like fat tubs of goo when swimsuit weather comes around. He doesn't look bad at all, in my opinion. He has a bit of a belly but that's it. If he sticks with it it will actually make my job easier because I hate planning two separate meals.   When  I was in college, I joined the Army Reserves. I had been fighting with my dad about my major; I joined so I could pay my own way. My Bachelor's is in Anthropology; nowadays I think my dad was right.   When you first try to join, you take the ASVAB, the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery, a multiple choice test which tells you and your recruiter which MOS (Military Occupational Specialty) you are suited for. I kicked ass in every category. I was denied any of the fun combat-oriented specialties because I'm a girl so I went for 91A, Medic. Actually, they are, or were, mini-medics. I don't think this MOS exists any more. 91A's could serve in the field as EMTs as well as serve in hospitals as nursing assistants.  I was right - I did some online research and 91A's and B's (B's were super EMTs) no longer exists. It most closely resembles a 91W. Another aside: the number is a general area, the letter the specialty. For instance a combat person is an 11; 11B is an infantryman, 11C is artillery.   Once you figure out what you're going to do, the recruiter signs you up for a medical at a Military Entrance Processing Station, or  urlLink MEPS . Mine was at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. All I remember is a really busy day filled with all kinds of tests. Oh, yes; I came to understand what 'hurry up and wait' meant; a term I would become intimately familiar with in my military career.  I signed my contract while there and took my oath to defend the constitution (not the PRESIDENT, not DEMOCRACY, the Constitution) of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I remember doing this on October 31st, 1996. I shipped out for Basic in February 1997. I went through my training during the Reagan years, which was a great time to be a soldier (good budget).  Once it was time to go in I went back to MEPS for more tests, paper signing, and waiting around. Then I remember staying about a week in these kind of holding barracks. I don't remember much; we waited around for the company to fill up and learned a few things like rudimentary marching, standing at attention, parade rest, and a few other things. I was yet to become familiar with the front-leaning rest position, but that was to come. I think I had to take a Physical Training (PT) test - I had to do one good push-up. Female requirements were a joke. Some women couldn't do one proper pushup though. I shouldn't be scornful; Zeus knows I had problems running.  People who failed the test were grouped off for a couple of weeks to work on PT. Having your basic training extended by a two weeks must have really blown chunks.  I was in a platoon with all females in Basic. I mean women. Jeez, I start talking about the army and I slip right back into Armyspeak. Nowadays Basic training is mixed sex but way back when I would have been dropped for pushups had I even looked at a man. Not that I didn't. Matter of fact, isn't it far more amusing to do something banal when it's considered naughty? I don't smoke so I didn't try to sneak cigarettes so I leered at men.  Through my army-issue glasses, which are known as birth control or rape prevention glasses. They all look like Drew Carrey's specs. I was horridly ugly but I didn't really care. I was in a Company of Women, fer pete's sake. The only men who would talk to me were drill sargeants, and I don't recall ever being attracted to any of them. Too busy hating them, I guess.  When in basic training you are assigned a 'buddy'. This person is your partner through everything. I think we even washed each other's backs on occasion (you men out there quit snickering!). Mine was a woman from New Mexico named Mitchell. I can't recall her first name, which is a shame. I think it was Lucy. I  lucked out. She was smart, and not too loud. We became friends.   Basic was 8 weeks, which consisted of three phases. I can't recall exactly what they were called; all I remember is one was Drill and Ceremony, Rifle Training, then Field Training.  Drill and Ceremony was learning how to march. All of it's a blur to me: get up, do PT (Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays were calisthenics, and Tuesdays and Thursdays was running), go eat, do something, go eat, do something, go eat, do something, go sleep. Any free time, clean. Lather, rinse, repeat.   Our barracks were old World War II barrracks at the bottom of Tank Hill. I bet they have been replaced by now. For our run, we would run up the hill, then down. Up the hill, then down. Ahhhhh. Good times! I joke but I have some insanely strong memories and impressions from those 8 weeks. I'm trying to catch some of them before they fade completely.  Do something was sometimes marching, sometimes class work during the first three weeks. I do recall some field exercises, which involved marching to some course and running around with dummy rifles with bayonets attached. I recall some obstacle courses. I don't have a linear memory, so Athena knows which happened when.  Somewhere during this time we learned about Mission Oriented Protective Posture, or MOPP, or how to protect ourselves in a Nuclear, Biological, or Chemical attack( NBC, of course). This involved not only donning a gas mask, but these charcoal-impregnated overclothes as well as cumbersome rubber gloves and boots. It was a no-brainer for me; my buddy Mitchell had claustrophobia so I remember spending some time talking her away from panic attacks. This didn't annoy me; matter of fact I recall feeling protective towards her.  NBC training of course led to one of the most infamous sections of basic training - the GAS CHAMBER! Feh. The gas chamber was supposed to give you confidence in your gear - let you know that yes, indeedy, your gas mask worked. One at a time, we were taken into a CS-filled room, told to hold our breath, break the seal on our gas masks, and then clear it. I recall thinking that my eyes were a little sting-y, but it wasn't bad. Then they told us to take the mask completely off.  I had decided before I went in that I wasn't going to do anything stupid, like try to hold my breath. I immediately took my mask off and breathed in. That little stinging sensation went from a tickle to feeling like my face and throat had been scrubbed with nettles. I couldn't breathe at all. I recall thinking it was kind of like a really bad athsma attack.  So I stood there, not breathing, eyes, nose and mouth leaking, looking at my drill sargeant and patiently waiting for my next instructions. He told me and I walked out of there, gas mask in one hand and helmet in the other. I found Mitchell and we joked about shit while trying to get our breath back. It's funny how fond I am of those memories.  Tomorrow I'll write about my first helicopter ride and the Chipyong-Ni Breakdance.

      Well, dang. Those  urlLink Dragon Boat exercises  and stretches I'm doing for my rotator cuff are working! After less than a week my left shoulder is no longer sore. It has been hurting for almost 4 months and once I got around to doing something about it it went away like that.  I'll keep doing them, of course. I do them for both shoulders.  Jon bought a six-pack last night so naturally I had to have a couple. I kept my eating hypocaloric, but beer does not have that many good nutrients in it. I got through Back and Biceps at the gym this morning but I am bushed.  You know, as much as I hate running, it would be fun to train for and enter the  urlLink  8 Tuff Miles  race in St. John. Well, *fun* might be an inappropriate word. I'm just looking for an excuse to go back, of course. Since the last one was run this last Saturday, I'd have a whole year to train for it. Yes, I know endurance training and strength training are not the same thing, but they aren't mutually exclusive, either. I just have to be prepared to not be as strong as I want to be.  77 Days until I'm 40.

      I'm pleased with myself: I had planned to go to the gym this morning and do some leg exercises. I had only planned to run on the treadmill for about 6 minutes just to warm up, but I felt so good this morning I went ahead and ran for 20 minutes.  The reason I'm doing leg exercises on Mondays now is because I exercise my upper body 3 times a week. Even though I am concentrating on specific areas (chest, back, shoulders), there is some spillover in the muscle groups. I think I can get better results with my leg routine (squats, stiff-legged deadlifts, and calf raises) if I do them twice a week. I realize that with all the running I'm planning to do that's an awful lot of leg work. I'm not doing that much weight right now - I'm working more on endurance- and I'm watching myself for exhaustion, especially now that I'm doing the hypocaloric thing again.  It is precisely 78 days until my 40th birthday. I really do want to meet that day in the best shape I've ever been in. Considering that except for when I went through basic training I have always been a couch potato, that's simply not too difficult to accomplish.  Back to feeling so good this morning: why is it that eating around 1200 calories a day eventually leads to me feeling so great? From what I have read I have a feeling it has more to do with the ketogenic variable - less carbs mean fewer mood swings. I never realized how crappy I felt until I feel this good.  I can tell spring is around the corner; our little drop zone has had 2 good weekends in a row. I did four jumps this weekend - all on Saturday. (Total: 943 - only 57 more to go to get my 1,000 jump merit badge!) Two of them were student jumps with the same student; a woman - hell, a girl; she ain't old enough to buy a beer. She is a little heavy and I have a tough time staying down with her even though I wore 10 pounds in my weight vest. The good thing is she was doing her levels 6 and 7; by the time they are doing those levels they know how to get stable and save their own lives so even if I mess up I can still see them practice their maneuvers and not worry too much about their safety.   But students are crafty devils so it's best not to let your guard down ever. The good news is she passed both levels; level 7 is the last one so now she can jump by herself. She is still a student; she just doesn't need an instructor with her any more. Now she gets to work on a proficiency card that will lead to her 'A' (basic) license.  I love being able to graduate  students. They get so happy. I get more hugs that way.  Saturday night we had a pot-luck party. I made pasta salad - do you know how hard it is to make a gigantic tub of pasta salad and not eat any of it? I managed to keep on track; I did have a half a piece of corn bread - mmmm - but that's it as far as the carbs went. Well, there's the three Michelob Ultra. Guess I'll have to count those.  Sunday I came home early and did absolutely nothing. I restarted  Baldur's Gate  again on my computer but other than that I did nada. I didn't even watch the Oscars. Wish I had; I was so happy that Peter Jackson won.   My what a boring post. I don't even have a top 10 list of favorite actor's noses or anything. Speaking of top 10 though, I am happy to modify my top 10 food staples list. The Wal-Mart in Madison is stocking my favorite condiment,  urlLink Sriracha chili sauce . Actually, Huy Fong, the manufacturer, makes a chili garlic paste that is just as tasty, but dang I'm so happy to see this on the store shelf! One tablespoon has about 4 carbs, but that's more than you will need to set your mouth on fire.

       At Nancy's  recommendation, Jon and I watched the first 4 episodes of the 1st season of  urlLink 24 . Pretty darn good, so far. It's an interesting gimmick: 24 hours - each hour is an episode and things are in 'real time'. And the best thing is Jon watched it with me and he's interested in watching the rest. Yay! I couldn't get him interested in  Angel  at all. You know, the older Kiefer Sutherland gets, the more he looks like his old man.   The other  day I proved to myself once and for all that my cat is stone deaf. We did take her to the vet; he looked her over and said he couldn't find anything wrong with her ears. Last Tuesday I was vacuuming the house and I saw her asleep on a box. So I turned the vacuum cleaner off; rolled it up right next to her, then turned it on. If you own a cat you know that you would have to then use a putty knife and a claw hammer to scrape/pry kitty off the ceiling, but she didn't even budge. With the cleaner running, I woke her up by scritching her behind the ears; she stretched, yawned, and then went back to sleep. Yep, deaf as a post. Kinda envy her in a way.   The beer  is burping merrily away. Once I transfer it to the secondary fermenter I'll have a small taste to make sure nothing funny decided to breed in there. The secondary is merely getting the new beer off the bed of dead yeast which will start breaking down and adding funny flavors to the beer. Am I afraid of poisoning myself? Nah. No self-respecting pathogen would grow in that crap.   The secondary fermentation simply gives the more hardy yeast time to flocculate - wait, that's a cool word:    flocculate    SYLLABICATION: floc·cu·late   VERB: Inflected forms: floc·cu·lat·ed, floc·cu·lat·ing, floc·cu·lates   TRANSITIVE VERB: 1. To cause (soil) to form lumps or masses.  2. To cause (clouds) to form fluffy masses.   INTRANSITIVE VERB: To form lumpy or fluffy masses.   NOUN: Something that has formed lumpy or fluffy masses.     *Heh*. Any way, I will transfer the beer into its secondary fermenter, which will be its permanent home (until I drink it) which is an old metal Pepsi 5 gallon keg. I'll seal it, and burp it every 2 or 3 days to relieve the CO2 pressure for about 10 days. Then I'll hook it up to my CO2 tank and carbonate it. Mmmm. Because I'm doing the secondary fermentation in the keg, that first glass of beer will be about 90% flocculated (heh) yeast. Mmmmm! It's a great source of (if I recall correctly) vitamin B-12, which coincidentally is good for hangovers.   Oh, yeah . My other vocabulary word for the day:   bonhomie   SYLLABICATION: bon·ho·mie  NOUN: A pleasant and affable disposition; geniality.   ETYMOLOGY: French, from bonhomme, good-natured man : bon, good (from Latin bonus).  OTHER FORMS: bonho·mous (bn-ms) —ADJECTIVE

      Just to make you run from the room screaming; here's my useless prattle about redheaded Englishmen for the week. From an article someone uncovered on the web:   FRIDAY: When I get out of this limo, I’m going to walk into a room and meet Tom Hanks.  I must remember to tell him how much I like Philadelphia, Saving Private Ryan, Apollo 13, his ‘serious’ work.  But all I really want to talk about is Splash, Big, and Bachelor Party, the ones I grew up on.  ‘Hey, Damian, thanks for coming.  You must be tired after flying all the way from London.’ Tom is speaking to me.  Before I can stop myself, I’ve launched into one of the unfunniest jokes I’ve ever made.  I rub my arms, and blurt out: ‘Yeah, my arms are pretty stiff,’ (implying I’d actually flown).  Geddit? Genius.  Traffic comes to a screeching halt.  Tumbleweed blows through the room.  Silence. 	 ‘Did this guy just say what I think he said?’ At least, this is the look on Tom’s face.  His jaw slightly open, a look of utter disbelief in his eyes.  The silence lasts a few seconds before Tom, realizing that he simply has to help me out of this horrible moment, yells out: ‘Aw, okay, funny guy.  Very good.  Sit down over here.’  He can’t possibly give me a job after that, I’m thinking, but undeterred, Tom cracks on.  We act together.  I play Winters.  Tom does all the other characters.  My accent is now rock solid.  Nothing can shake it.  Not even Tom’s beard, now so big for the film Castaway that I can’t be sure it’s even him talking.  	 ‘Okay, you’re too good.  Get outta here,’ he yells, oozing bonhomie.  Tony To appears from behind another door.  ‘Nice work, Damian, you have nothing to worry about.’ A little cryptic for my tastes, but assuming he means a job well done, I go out and get absolutely smashed until five in the morning.  8AM NEXT MORNING: ‘Damian, are you awake?  Steven would like to see you at midday.”  It’s Meg, the casting director.  I cry into my pillow.  Little simpering sobs at first, then naked hysterical screaming.  The biggest meeting of my life and I’ve blown it.  I’ve had three hours’ sleep and I’m still drunk.   By midday I’ve had three cold showers, five coffees and stubbed my toe a lot.  I walk into the office sweating heavily and shaking.  We’re introduced.  ‘I used to live in Hampstead,’ Steven tells me.  ‘Maybe we know the same people?’ Not unless you’ve been around Kensal Green lately mate, I thought to myself. ‘Do you know Ralph Fiennes?’ he asks. ‘Yes, yes, I do,’ I nearly fall off my chair with excitement that I can actually continue this conversation with Steven Spielberg. ‘We did Hamlet together on Broadway.  I played Laertes,’ I say. Steven remembers the show and even me in it.  He saw it twice.  He liked it.  This is good.  We chat some more.  Steven’s off to watch his kid play soccer. I want to tell him it’s called football.  Probably not the best time, though.    Tom has to go and buy a Christmas tree with his daughter.  They leave.  Tony looks at me and says:‘So, ready for boot camp in March?” I leap up and kiss everyone in the room.  I’ve got the part!  I’m Dick Winters.  I’m in Band of Brothers.   Hey, he's an actor, therefore he's a Twinkie; he seems to write well for a Twinkie, though.  I want him for my birthday, in case any one's trying to think of a gift for me.

       Eventually I'm  going to move this blog elsewhere. I have discovered due to our DSL connection Jon and I have a certain amount of free web space. I'll probably eat that up pretty quick because I want to post photos. I'll have to do some judicious editing to previous posts because my husband doesn't know about this (yet). I tend to value the unvarnished truth to diplomacy for the most part, but not everybody does.    I did  skydive last weekend - 8 jumps. 4 fun jumps and 4 AFF. My grand total is 977; 23 more to go for my nice, round number. God willing and the skies don't rain I should get that by my birthday.   The beer  has started to ferment. Last night when I got home from work, I took the lid off my plastic brewing bucket and panicked because I saw no tell-tale yeast foam on the top of the wort. So I went to plan B, which is a good dry yeast. I sprinkled that on top and closed the lid again. I hate plastic buckets because you can't tell what's going on inside. I used to have a 6 1/2 gallon glass carboy but my husband broke it. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find one of those puppies?   So I checked it again this morning and I still saw no activity in the airlock. The airlock incidentally allows built up C02 gas to escape but doesn't allow any other air back in. Good thing or else things would go all explody. Sorry, that's one of my favorite Buffyisms.   Speaking of  Buffy (sort of), TNT is now showing Season 4 of Angel. I'm not sure I like what's happening to Cordelia, but I knew she was being too sanctimonious even for her. So she's the Big Bad of the season. And poor Wes. He has no luck with women. Anyway, one recent episode had a demon tear through Wolfram and Hart, inc. Everybody died (but Lilah. Cordy took care of her instead) and came back as zombies. I'm not exactly sure why; but what the hell. You know how much I love zombies.  It's always good to see Faith. Hey, one scene had a random vampire recognize her as a Slayer so he took off running. Apparently not all Buffyverse vampires are stupid. Yes, I'm including Angel and Spike. Neither of them are noted for their deep wisdom.   Back to  the beer; I took the cover off again this morning and there is yeast activity. Now I just hope I haven't contaminated the wort. Stay tuned.

       I wonder  if Frank Sinatra and Sid Vicious are together somewhere in the afterlife singing duets? They were both self-affirmed punks, after all.   I took  yesterday off as a vacation day - Jon and I spent most of it getting our house finally in order from the move. 3 months after the move we officially have everything out of the boxes.  I spent yesterday afternoon brewing beer - now that's a hobby of mine that displays the INTP nature of becoming competent (but not mastering) at a skill. I know just enough about beer brewing to brew up a decent batch of ale but that's as far as I got.  Just to bore you, Beer is composed of 4 main ingredients: water, malted barley, yeast, and hops. You also have adjuncts, which can be anything from corn syrup to jalepeno peppers. The water is self-explanatory. Barley is a type of grain - "malted" means it has been allowed to germinate then dried. If you chewed on some malted barley as opposed to unmalted, the malted tastes sweeter.   Malted barley (and malted wheat, sometimes) is lightly crushed and allowed to steep in hot water. This is called "mashing" and basically it's converting the starches in the malted grain into sugar. The sugar water is drained from the leftover husks, then allowed to boil for an hour or so. During the boil, hops are added at certain intervals to counteract the sweetness and provide flavors. Trust me. Without hops beer would be so gaggingly sweet no one but desperate alcoholics would drink it. And Southerners. Have you ever drank store-bought sweet tea? About the same in sweetness. At least kool-aid has citric acid.  I digress. After boiling the crap out if it, this sweet water is referred to as "wort". The wort is cooled, then yeast is introduced, and then it's all up to those little buggers to eat the sugar, and piss alcohol and fart CO2.  Once they are done, the beer is removed from the dead yeast bed. At that point it can either be force-carbonated with CO2 (usually done if kegging), or a little more sugar can be re-introduced so that the more stubborn yeast remaining can carbonate the beer naturally (usually done if bottling). Note national breweries force-carbonate everything.  I buy pre-measured kits with malt extracts. It means someone else has mashed the grain - I buy the wort, essentially. I add water, boil the crap out of it, and hop it up then add yeast. I own a freezer dedicated to beermaking / beer kegging so I set my fermenter in the freezer for temperature control while the yeast eat themselves silly.  Most people don't know this, but there's only two types of beer: Ale and Lager. Ales are brewed at higher temperatures, and the yeast tend to hang around the top of the wort. They also ferment out pretty fast (5 -7 days) so are ready for drinking quicker. Lagers are fermented at lower temperatures and can take months to ferment out. Lager yeasts tend to hang around the bottom. Ales can taste sweeter; lagers taste crisper. Most popular American beers are Lagers.   Everything else is style. Ale styles include the sweeter Scotch, Irish and Brown ales, and the heavily hopped Pale Ales and the dark Porters and Stouts to the light Cream ales. Lagers include the light Pilsners to the dark German Bocks. Most American beers are modelled after the Czech Pilsners. I don't dislike American Beer; I was drinking Michelob Light during my brew session last night. I'm just glad that there's more variety available, thanks not only to imports, but regional brewers like Sam Adams and Anchor. I'm addicted to Anchor Porter almost as much as I love Guinness Stout. Mmmmmmm.  Styles are determined by recipe. When malt is dried, it can be roasted for a darker, richer flavor. This procedure is what gives the darker brews their color. Darker beers do not neccessarily have greater alcohol content; that is determined by how much sugar you start with and end with in the brew. American beers tend to use rice or corn which can give the beers a lighter flavor because the sugar from these grains tend to brew out more than those in barley (conversion to alcohol is more complete). You aren't going to hear me complain too loudly: you go mow the lawn then reach into your refrigerator for a Guinness! Blech.   I am brewing an Irish Red Ale. It's somewhat similar to Killian's Red; except that's a lager so mine tastes a little richer. Mmmm.  Right now I'm in that 24 - 48 hour period where I'm worried that I killed my yeast. If you exercise good sanitation techniques, once you introduce the yeast it should be the dominant bug in the brew so it will go forth and multiply so fast that no other bug will get a toe-hold. However if the yeast are quitters any other germ can have a field day. So far I have never had a batch of bad beer (except one bad attempt at lager. That wasn't bugs, though. It tasted like shoe. I think I let it ferment at too high a temp) due to non-yeasty bugs taking over.  We shall see.

       Just for  Nancy, this week's Melancholic Moment is brought to you by Dylan Thomas. Now when you read this it is important to imagine Rodney Dangerfield is reciting it:   Do not go gentle into that good night, Old age should burn and rave at close of day; Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Though wise men at their end know dark is right, Because their words had forked no lightning they Do not go gentle into that good night.  Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight, and learn, too late, they grieved it on its way, Do not go gentle into that good night.  Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay, Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  And you, my father, there on the sad height, Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray. Do not go gentle into that good night. Rage, rage against the dying of the light.    Well, I  finally watched a movie that wasn't stupid. Bizarre, yes, but not stupid. It took me a couple of hours after watching  urlLink Adaptation  to decide whether I liked it or not. Ultimately, I did.   What is it about? Well, let's see. There's this screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman (Nicholas Cage), who has been assigned to adapt the book  the Orchid Thief  into a screenplay, but he's discovered that it's pretty much unadaptable. He himself, is a neurotic mess; he is overweight, balding, and terribly shy. He lives with his twin brother, Donald (Cage again), who is nothing like him personality-wise. As he wrestles with the book, trying to find a way to portray it on the screen, his leech of a brother decides he's going to write a screenplay, too. His novel idea is to write a screenplay about a serial killer, sort of a  Silence of the Lambs  meets  Psycho .  The book Charlie's trying to adapt is about literally an orchid thief, John Larouche (the always watchable Chris Cooper) who hunts for rare orchids in the swamps of Florida along with a group of Seminole Indians. When they get caught, Larouche's whole defense is because the Seminoles were picking the flowers it is legal, even though the swamp - I mean wetlands - is a protected wildlife preserve. The book's author, Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep, whom I have slowly forgiven for  Sophie's Choice , an unbelievably pointless and depressing movie), interviews Larouche for a  New Yorker  piece, and slowly discovers a fascinating man who at first glance comes across as a wierd redneck.  Charlie's social life (which essentially is reduced to conjugal relations with his hand) is a mess; his agent (the always watchable and cute as a button Ron Livingston) is on his back about getting the book adapted, and his brother's trite script gets sold for a cool million. His brother swears by this guy who holds these 3-day scriptwriting seminars (the always watchable Brian Cox - yes, I was delighted with the supporting cast of this movie!) so Charlie, desperate, attends one even though he initially tells his brother those kind of seminars are ripoffs.  Charlie to this point has been resisting the standard Hollywood fare. He wants to be honest to the book, and not sensationalize it at all. After some conversations with the scriptwriting guru the movie gets really wierd.  And I won't describe the third act just in case you might want to watch. What is really mindnumbing about this movie is this: Charlie Kaufman is a real screenwriter. He's famous for writing  Being John Malkovich , another totally bizarre movie. We even see him on the set; being dissed and ignored by Spike Jonze and John Cusack (played by Jonze and Cusack respectively). His brother Donald doesn't exist, even though he gets screenwriting credit for this movie.  I had to check:  The Orchid Thief  is a real book and Susan Orlean and John Larouche are real people. I wonder what they thought about this movie.  So other than trying to sort out fact from fiction, what did I like about this movie? Well it never bored me, and I had a tough time figuring out what would happen next. I love a challenge. Plus, there's one point in the movie where Charlie and Donald are discussing their differences (in a swamp - don't ask). Charlie is reminding Donald of a time where he was talking to a girl in school. Donald smiled, and reminisced that he was madly in love with the girl. Charlie pointed out that when he walked away, the girl and some of her friends made fun of him behind his back. Donald says something to the extent that hes he knew about it, but that didn't change the fact that he was in love with her. Some people would look at what he says next as the theme of the movie: "You are what you love, not what loves you", but I liked much better what he says next: "What she felt was her business".  Kaufman kept touching on things like that, things that are essential to my philosophy. Life got much easier for me when I stopped caring about what was going on in other people's heads. That's their business.

       Oh, yeah.  Just read Nancy's blog and couldn't resist:   If I ever have a kid I'll have to figure out what to do about it. If I ever need it there's no point in having them locked up and unloaded but I would not like to have my kid accidentally blow his (or my) brains out. I always hear stories about kids playing with guns. My dad owned (owns?) an arsenal, and out of his five kids, none of us ever played with the weapons. Dad never hit us (that was mom's job), so I have to think it was because from an early age we were trained in handgun safety (and I mean early! I remember shooting my dad's .357 when I was 5). I was, at least, intensely aware of what that gun could do to a watermelon (heh heh. Kewl!).  Statistics are funny things, of course. I dug around a bit; in the 0-14 year old category, in 2000 943 kids died in accidental drownings, and in 1995 (I tried to find 2000 stats) 250 died in accidental handgun deaths. I'm not about to brick over my pool, so STAY AWAY! I'M A MADMAN, I TELL YOU! MY POOL IS FULL OF WATER!! Damn kids.  Yes, there's a fence around our pool. The trouble with making anything foolproof is that fools are so ingenious. And that includes kids. If a kid breaks into our back yard and drowns, what do you think the parents are going to do to us? Maybe I should brick the damn thing up.

       I need  a new job. I like programming; but in context it is a soul-sucking experience to work in a corporation this large. I'm too damn lazy to be self employed.   I could open a pool-cleaning service, considering how much I learned about that in the last week. I didn't go swimming; the water is too cold. So I grabbed some beer and sat by the poolside dangling my feet in the water and read while the sun set. Pretty. Goddamn bugs.   No stupid  movies last night, unless you want to call 1/2 of  urlLink X-Men  stupid, which I guess you could. Eh, it was entertaining; but I spent most of the time wishing Hugh Jackman would do something about that hair helmet. Magneto's cool. The second movie is much better. How often do you get to say that?

       This week's  melancholy moment (courtesy Denis Leary):   Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up. Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now.    You're gonna have to mow the lawn, do the dishes, make your bed. You're gonna have to go to school until you're seventeen.   You might have to go to war, shoot a gun, kill a nun. You might have to go to war when you get outta school!   You're gonna have to deal with stress, deal with stress, deal with stress. You're gonna be a giant mess when you get back from the war.   Life's gonna suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up. Life's gonna suck when you grow up, it sucks pretty bad right now!   You're gonna wind up smoking crack, on your back, face the fact. You're gonna wind up hooked on smack, and then you're gonna die!     Jon and I  are trying to get the pool ready for swimming. We are painfully learning the Way of Pool Maintenence. First off you have to dump in a buttload of chlorine, which is called "shocking the pool". I'm sure all the little organisms who lived in the pool were quite shocked when we dumped that stuff in. So shocked, they all had heart attacks and died and are now building up sediment layers on the bottom.  Also on the bottom are all the leaves that collected over the winter. We have a special little gadget that sweeps and collects them off the bottom; we also have another special gadget that vacuums up the dead algae, dirt and whatnot that has collected as well. You try vacuuming a pool. It's a pain in the butt. We priced out some of those little robot gadgets that continuously do it; at first we decided $600 wasn't worth it but now I'm thinking that's a bargain.  I also learned how to prime the pool pump, turn it on and off and purge it (that gets rid of all the crap that gets caught in the sand filter).  Then you have to skim off all the floating leaves and insects. Holy cow, the insects! What do I expect from Alabama? I'm sure this Summer will be more fun. I hope I won't have to fish out dead frogs and snakes but I bet I will. Most of the time the pool's filtration system grabs the unlucky creepy crawlies but still I'm not jumping in the damn pool if a 4" dead spider is randomly drifting around the area. I have my limits.  I'm hoping we'll have it clean enough this afternoon so I can float around w/ a beer and a paperback for a while. Bet it will rain.   Last night's  stupid movie was  urlLink S*W*A*T . I remember that series from when I was a kid but the movie had nothing to do with the show except the names of some of the characters. Unlike all of the stupid movies I have been watching recently, this one finally broke my Golden Rule of Movies: Just Don't Bore Me!   What a waste of a perfectly decent cast. I like Samuel L. Jackson, L.L. Cool J and Colin Farrell (he's cute, but does nothing for me. He can act. And he has a pretty good American accent). I put it on my Netflix queue mainly for Michelle Rodriguez but she's wasted here. Hell, she played pretty much the exact same character in  Resident Evil  (Tough Hispanic Chick in a paramilitary unit) but had 5 times more to do in that movie! Dammit, if she's going to get typecast into the Tough Chick role, at least let her hit someone. Sheesh.   The bad guy was a French mobster. I think. He spoke French. I guess they are bad guys du jour. God forbid we have Arab terrorist bad guys (they don't exist, of course). But the French are good targets. I'm really surprised he wasn't a French Nazi Mobster. I guess there were too many African Americans in the cast to have any of the antagonists display any racism (actually a nice change of pace), so they had to have them display sexism ( a *girl* on a SWAT team! Horrors!). So what does she do? She gets herself shot.   Anyway, the real problem with the movie was that Action movies are supposed to have Action. Right? Bad director! No cookie!

       Just a  quick note today: I'm busy and can't think of anything to talk about.  So here's my random link of the week: urlLink Dante's Inferno and All-Night Video Store . The man who owns this site has an enormous appetite for direct-to-video movies. He must have seen everything Don "the Dragon" Wilson and Lou Diamond Phillips have ever done. I also like the personal pages he has on his site. He's a member of the U.S. Army; his stories of his days in Germany are fascinating to me. Plus any one who rescues a cat and names it "Jet Jaguar" is okay in my book. You have seen  Godzilla Vs. Megalon , haven't you?

        Bleah!  Sinus headaches. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.  Yes, I did skydive. 8 jumps in, 4 with my brother. I'm really enjoying teaching him my sport. Maybe because he's competent. I get impatient with people who don't listen to what I'm saying.  I went home Sunday, took some sinus medication, and curled up on the couch with Books 2 and 3 of George R.R. Martin's   A Song of Ice and Fire . Since TiVo automatically records anything with my top 10 actors in it (man, am I getting tired of deleting  Armageddon !), I put the tv on and played  Band of Brothers  (showing on the Hitler channel) on in the background; looking up only at the really interesting bits. There's a lot of interesting bits so I think I read maybe 6 chapters.   Stayed home Monday, still suffering (but hey; I still had plenty of sinus medication, books, and BoB episodes to keep me company). When Jon got home, we bought chinese take-out, and watched  Cabin Fever , a stupid horror movie.  5 college students vacation during a break in a cabin in the woods. Stop me if you've heard this one before. A stranger with some horrible flesh-eating disease stumbles into their camp and begs them to help. Because he is spewing up blood, however, they chase him off (after conveniently ruining their truck). One by one these students contract the disease, and the locals aren't much help.  First off, all the students are jerks. I especially wanted the jock to die, and he did (yay!). Oops, hope I didn't spoil anything for you. Matter of fact, he dies, she dies; everybody dies! One guy doesn't contract the illness - and as he dances out of the cabin in joy, I realize the stupid son of a bitch has *not* seen  Night of the Living Dead . Still, I had to shout "Just DIE all ready!" two or three times before someone obliged and whacked the bastard.  Best seen with low expectations and a black sense of humor. And a tolerance for flesh-eating bacteria.

      Last night's stupid movie was a stupid Vietnam war movie  urlLink The Boys in Company C . It's a lot more lame than I remember - I don't think I've seen it since it first came out (in 1978!). Matter of fact, the only thing I found interesting about this movie is that Lee Ermey was in it as yes, a marine drill instructor. This movie predates  Full Metal Jacket  by 9 years and this movie was his first role.  Other than Lee Ermey, the only other bright point was the main character was a black man who *didn't* die. Everyone in this movie, however, needs to attend  Overactor's Anonymous  meetings. Except for Ermey. I love him just the way he is. Yes, I watch  Mail Call  on the Hitler Channel all the time.   Bad blood Is takin' you for a ride The only thing good about bad blood Is lettin' it slide    I have a soft spot for  That 70's Show . My favorite characters are Eric Foreman's parents, Kitty and Red. Especially Kitty. She endeared me during an episode where Eric went with her to work. It was 'take your son to work' day at school, but Red had been laid off so Eric went to the hospital where Kitty was employed as a nurse. He was rattled by how different his mother was and how tough the work could be. He freaks somewhat at a dead body. At the end of the ep as he and Kitty were driving home, Eric tries to ask her how she could stand it, do her work, day in and day out. Kitty is singing along with an Elton John (okay, Neil Sedaka) song I haven't heard in *years* (Bad Blood) and instead of answering nudges him into sing along with her.   My mom's a nurse - or was, but now she's retired. It was a good scene - Eric (and I) developed some strong respect for Kitty.

       Argh.  After two tough days at work it's nice to sit down and watch stupid movies.  Last night's feature was a stupid disaster movie,  urlLink The Core . The earth's core has stopped spinning, so the electro-magnetic field surrounding the earth is dissipating which is causing all sorts of natural disasters. A rag-tag team of scientists take a new type of vehicle to the core to jump-start it into spinning again.  Really! I swear on a stack of Edgar Rice Burroughs books that's what it was about!  I have absolutely no idea how bad the science in The Core was; I'll leave it up to  urlLink a scientist  to rip it to shreds (he lays into the movie, not only for the bad science, but the bad grammar. He noticed the exact same thing on a computer screen that I noticed last night).  The deeply entertaining part of this movie for me was predicting who would live and who would die.  Not only was my score %100, I predicted the order in which they would die. Here's the rag-tag group:   1:  Hunky (and, to his credit, a little dorky) Hero Scientist (played by Aaron Eckhart, who looks like the middle frame of a morph between Thomas Jane and Viggo Mortensen). He's the reluctant hero who rises to the challenges presented him as things go bad.   2:  Older (and white male) vehicle Pilot-in Command. He offers serious advice to his protege (see below) about being in charge and making tough decisions.   3:  Spunky (and hottie female) vehicle co-pilot. She is highly skilled and cocky, but not as experienced as the P.I.C.    4:  Foreign Scientist. Best friend to Hunky Hero Scientist who doesn't want to save the world, just his wife and two children.   5:  Brilliant Asshole Scientist. It's secretly his fault that the core stopped spinning.   6:  Brilliant Scientist/Inventor of the vehicle and its drill. He has a grudge against Brilliant Asshole Scientist, who made a lot of money off of some things that they invented together (but did not share royalties with). I should mention that he's a Black Male.  So, who lives and who dies, and why? I paused the movie just before they started their venture to the center of their earth, and told my husband:  -Oh, by the way, if you don't want to be spoiled, don't read this -   First to die will be the Older White Male Pilot in Command. He *has* to die. Otherwise, how can the spunky co-pilot learn how to lead, plus show off her superior piloting skills?  Second will be the Foreign Friend. He's European, with a wife and kids. We *like* him, so he is so toast. I knew he would be second becaust the third and the fourth would have to come later in the movie.  Third to die will be the Brilliant Inventor. He has to die doing something to fix something on his beloved ship. Plus, he's the one Black member of the crew. They *always* die.   Fourth to die will be the Brilliant Asshole Scientist. He must die because it's all his fault. To the screenwriter's credit, he's not Eeevil, he's just a jerk who invented things for the military and something went wrong. He does not try to throw a monkey wrench into the Hunky Hero Scientist's desperate plans when things go wrong (which is the Uniform Code of Eeevil Scientists and Military Types everywhere), but actually tries to help. He even supplies the missing piece of information that will make the plan work. Still, he's the asshole so he must die.  Hunky Hero Scientist and Hot Babe Hotshot Pilot live. Why? Because they are pretty.  I would congratulate myself on being so perfect in my Disaster Movie knowledge, but any 11 year old could have done the same. Still, I got a lot of good laughs for every time I was correct; plus my husband kept me in stitches with his own Star Trek generated techno-babble voiceovers: " The granualarity hydrometer is reading off. We have to recalibrate the gorgonzola extracticator to push the crystallizers out."  Okay, yeah, we were drunk. How was your Tuesday?

      Existence, well what does it matter I exist on the best terms I can The past is now part of my future The present is well out of hand   melancholy   SYLLABICATION: mel·an·chol·y  NOUN:  1. Sadness or depression of the spirits; gloom: “There is melancholy in the wind and sorrow in the grass” (Charles Kuralt). 2. Pensive reflection or contemplation.  3. Archaic a. Black bile. b. An emotional state characterized by sullenness and outbreaks of violent anger, believed to arise from black bile.   ADJECTIVE:  1. Affected with or marked by depression of the spirits; sad. See synonyms at sad.  2. Tending to promote sadness or gloom: a letter with some melancholy news. 3. Pensive; thoughtful.  This month's  INTP Melancholic Moments  brought to you in part by Harlan Ellison, Kurt Vonnegut, and Philip K. Dick. Thanks, guys.  I don't spend too much time thinking about the past and I don't know if that's a good thing. Most of what I remember is fragmented: my most vivid memories are sensations and not specific incidents. Unles I was horrendously embarrassed then of course I remember the whole thing.   I don't look forward to dying, who does? Death I suppose is no big deal unless I'm wrong and I wake up burning in Hell. Or maybe my fondest hope will come true and I'll be sent back to try again. So any way, I'm not looking forward to the Big Sleep. So I woke up in the middle of this huge movie, and I'll have to leave before it's over. Sad, but then there's the alternative; which is being there for the Big Finish. Yikes.   So I don't look forward and I don't look back. Each day I wake up and try to find a few moments or hours where I can just sit back and *think* about things. "Things" can range from politics, philosophy, plain old fantasies or some fine looking man's nekkid bod( In the philosophy side of things, I'm with Bentham about pleasure: quality isn't an issue). The things that actually happen to me during the day may stay with me a while, but for the most they fade. Is it a wonder I like books and movies so much? They are static; the book I read when I was 13 will begin and end the same as now when I'm 40. Context matters; if I had read the Harry Potter series when I was 8 or 9 it would have affected me far differently. I'm sure I would have been completely obsessed by the series. Immersed. Some day I'll tell you about how worked up I got by the Hardy Boys or the 6 Million Dollar Man. Or maybe I won't.  What frustrates me is when I find a "happy place" (puerile term but it fits), external or internal, it doesn't last. Sooner or later I have to leave. Going back to the Caribbean the last two years was frustrating to the extreme - what I saw with 30+ year old eyes was *not* the same as what I saw with 8 year old eyes, although some of the things I saw were beyond any memories I had as a kid. Take for instance the one scuba trip where I was in the back and came right up on a sea turtle laying low behind some coral. Face to face with a sea turtle. They have these onery expressions. He noticed me looking at him and slowly swam away. It's hard imagining something like a turtle being graceful but there you go.  Was there a point to all this? Just that sometimes I think about how time in my life is like trying to scoop up water in my arms and hold it.    Enough  of that.  Jon and I watched  urlLink The Rundown  last night; by far one of the most satisfying stupid action movies I have seen in a long time. It starred 'the Rock' (his friends just call him the), and (unfortunately) Seann William Scott. It makes sense to pair this hosehead with Ashton Kuchtner, but Chow Yun-Fat( Bulletproof Monk .Disappointing)? But I tolerated his presence because the Rock is a hoot. An ex-wrestler, he's handsome, charismatic, and isn't afraid to make fun of himself. -And I just checked is imdb listing to get his real name, (Dwayne Douglas Johnson), and I was right! He is part Samoan.  Anyway - plot doesn't matter. The action set pieces are what makes this movie. Most of them are not overambitious - lots of punching and stuff, but imaginative. There are some explosions and Christopher Walken doing his Christopher Walken thing (I'd kill to see him in a musical, btw). The director (Peter Berg. Hi Pete! You were da bomb in  Shocker ) gets a little fancy to the point of distraction and it's just a little too long, but overall I enjoyed this stupid movie. Arnold Swarzennegger has a small cameo; he brushes past the Rock in a bar and mutters, "have fun!" Nice Meta Moment, there.  Oh, yeah. Ewan Bremner was in it. He was Ewan MacGregor's dorky friend in  Trainspotting . He has a pretty good American accent ( Blackhawk Down , Pearl Harbor ), but he had a ... some sort of... accent in this movie. I *think* it was scottish. Anyway, nice of him to get work, although it would have been a far more interesting movie to see him paired with the Rock instead of Stifler.  Nobody in Hollywood listens to me, though.

       I read  an  urlLink interview  with Damian Lewis recently, where he was talking about his character Soames Forsyte. The interview was over the phone. He made mention that he went to boarding school so lived for a while in a similar 'milieu' as the one presented in  the Forsyte Saga , but that he's a more 'ebullient' person than Soames. Is it okay for me to say how all hot and bothered I am for a man who can use the words 'ebullient' and 'milieu' in a phone conversation?  Dylan Baker has had a fairly solid career as a character actor. He and William H. Macy could play/be brothers. I was watching a preview of  urlLink Spider-Man 2  and he's in it. I am sure I am not the only one who gets rattled every time I see him in a role. It's because of the part he played in  urlLink Happiness , a very dark (ultra-violet) comedy. He played a psychiatrist who loves little boys. He did a fantastic job - I felt bad for the creep as well as thoroughly repulsed. That's the kind of role that can ruin a career.  Speaking of  Spider-Man 2 , (June 30) I'm judging by the trailer but it looks like it will be another angst-filled action fest. Or is that an action-filled angst fest? No matter. Bless Sam Raimi for taking his subject matter seriously. I have heard rumors that the people responsible for the James Bond franchise are going nuts because they can't come up with a decent script. Last I checked the most decent script they used was  Dr. No  in 1964. But I digress: get a clue you morons. If you want to revitalize the franchise it won't happen by more clever gadgets or explosions or the flavor-of-the-month teen idol. Get yourself a good director and screenwriter who will take the subject matter seriously then let them loose!  That reminds me:    Top 10 Internet Grammar/Spelling Errors/Quirks that Annoy Me*     10:  Using 'loose' when you mean 'lose'. You lose your keys. Your clothes feel loose after a few weeks of dieting.   9:  Two, to, and too. TWO students went TO the football game. My brother went, TOO.   8:  Free rein!   7:  Its and it's. This is a weird one that I get wrong sometimes. "Its" actually indicates possession, like its horn, its glasses, its teeth. "It's" is the contraction of "it is". It's raining.    6: Who and whom. Actually I don't care if people don't use 'whom'; it's going out of style. But if they do.... Here's a hint: re-word the question into a statement. (who or whom) is going to the dance? HE is going to the dance, therefore you use Who. With (who/whom) is he going to the dance? He is going to the dance with HIM. Therefore it is With whom is he going to the dance? Or use "Who is he going to the dance with?" see if I care. Just don't say "Whom is going to the dance?" Argh!!!    5:  "Irregardless" is a stupid word. Don't use it.   4:  Strunk and White are correct: Omit needless words! The fact of the matter is I'm guilty, too.   3: "Quotation marks" in a sentence or around an interjection to indicate emphasis. Don't do "this", really. It makes you look sarcastic. If you can't  underline  or  bold  your words, use *asterisks* to indicate emphasis, or even _underscores_. But "this" looks "sarcastic". "Okay?"   2:  I'm guilty of this, too... using ellipsis (ellipses?) when I write... And I thought using "whom" correctly was pretentious... bite me...   1:  Using an apostrophe to indicate plural. Use them to indicate possession, dammit! A car's door! Those cars over there! Those Cars' doors!  * which is hypocritical of me because I'll dangle a participle, split an infinitive, and end a sentence with a preposition with the best of them.

       I felt great  at the gym this morning, especially on the treadmill. I wish I had more days at the gym where I leave wanting to do a little more (as opposed to those days where I'm going "please, God, let it end!").  Jon and I watched  urlLink Commando  Wednesday night, and I'd like to reaffirm that it is indeed one of my favorite bad movies of all time. It gets worse and funnier with age. Jon was a little wierded out by a preteen Alyssa Milano - now he knows how I feel every time I see clips from  Empire of the Sun .  The new  South Park  was truly inspired; I have laughed myself silly in 3 out of 4 of this season's shows and the 4th had its moments. If there is one child in South Park who will grow up to be more deranged than Cartman, it has to be Butters. He apparently didn't lose an eye when Kenny nailed him with a shuriken, but his tapdancing has landed him a body count of 13.  Thanks to Netflix, Jon and I watched  urlLink Solaris  last night. I dislike George Clooney for his uncouth comments about Charlton Heston's Alzheimer's. His statements pretty much kept me from seeing this movie when it first came out. It's too bad this little gem tanked, because it's a good movie and Clooney the Asshole did a terrific job.  Nominally a science fiction story, Clooney plays a psychiatrist who is sent to investigate some odd occurences aboard a space station orbiting the planet Solaris. He finds two of the crew members dead, and the two remaining are freaked out. The first night aboard the space station he dreams about his dead wife, and when he wakes up she is next to him, flesh and blood.  I won't say more about the plot; it reminded me strongly of something I once said about religion. I once said I thought if humanity wanted to achieve the promise of eternal life, we better look to medicine, and if we want the promise of heaven, we better look to space. This movie is a wierd interpretation of the latter sentiment and it was like a punch in my gut. "No explanations, just choices" ouch ouch ouch ouch. By the end of this movie I was a blubbering puddle on my couch.  I checked Steve Soderbergh's credits through  urlLink IMDb ; I've seen a bunch of his stuff including  Out of Sight ,  Ocean's 11 ,  the Limey , and  Traffic . I like his spare style; and he seems to balance his directing between the crowd-pleasers and the art stuff. Hey, he's an Atlanta native, how about that?   I just realized, when I wrote out that synopsis, it sounds remarkably like  Event Horizon  which is a really bad movie that starts out with promise. It's funny what the difference between a good director (Soderbergh) and a bad director (Paul Anderson. No, not that Paul Anderson. The other one!) can make to a plot line.  And I'll make another comment about Clooney. The MPAA was going to give this movie an R rating because of a couple of butt shots. So what? Actually he has a fairly nice ass so I think some of the wrinkly MPAA bastards were just envious. But I digress - wait, one more comment: You can't see a man's butt unless you're 17. WTF. Hell, I fervently pray for the day I can see a man's erect penis in something other than low-budget porn but I guess that is never going to happen. What? I *like* erect penises. Penii? Sue me.  Back to Clooney. Technically I suppose he's handsome (although if I ever met him I'd tackle him and shape his eyebrows) but not my cup of tea. I do like the fact that he has a strong masculine presence - does that make sense? He's not a little boy the way Orlando Bloom is. He reminds me of Eric Bana that way. So why do I want Bana's love child but not Clooney's? (I knew that before his comments). Beats me.Was this going somewhere? Oh, yes. I still think he's an asshole, but he impressed me with his work in Solaris. Next time I'll cut him some slack and support such a thoughtful film in the theater if he ever does something like that again.

        Top 10 things I have heard/learned recently:     10:  Jason Isaacs and Ralph Fiennes will be in a movie together called  the Chumscrubber . No, I have no idea what a chumscrubber is - someone who washes fishguts of the decks of boats?   9:  Jason Isaacs will be on 3 episodes of  The West Wing  which I have never watched. Guess I will this time although I have a bad feeling: he plays a photojournalist on assignment in Israel. JI has a bad habit of dying and I bet this time it's no different.    8:  Christian Bale is Welsh-born with English roots. Damian Lewis is English-born with Welsh roots. I am Kansas City-born with Welsh/French/Dutch/Cherokee/Choctaw/Blackfoot roots. Actually, I've known that last bit for quite a while now.   7:  My dad and Ileana have moved permanently to Oklahoma (where the wind comes sweeping down the plain..). They are building a house on the same property where my grandparents used to live.   6:  Damian Lewis and Kristen Davis are not getting married, it's just an unfounded rumor. They aren't even dating.    5:  Roger Clemens is pitching for the Houston Astros. When the hell did that happen?   4:  Some people are getting jewelry deliberately imbedded in their eyeball. I'd rather get my clitoris pierced.   3:  Amphibian aircraft use type 4 fuel. It must be true; I saw it in  Commando .   2: Yellowstone Park is going to blow sky high... soon... I have a feeling that this one is a bit of overexaggerated net rumor.   1:  Xanax = good.

      I haven't written about the gym in a while - yes, we're still going. I'm frustrated by Preacher Curls - I strained some tendons in my wrists so I can't use the same amount of weight as I'm used to.   Am I still on the diet? No, I'm holding steady for a bit (as opposed to eating like a pig and gaining everything back).   I have had some amusing AFF dives lately - no students from Hell, but definitely a few from Heck:  Student #1 is a nice but nervous fellow who is about 5'6" and 240 pounds. Not only does he resemble a bowling ball he has the fall rate of a bowling ball. So despite putting every pound of lead shot into my weight vest that I could find, I had a difficult time keeping down with him. The other AFF instructor, Frank, isn't exactly a heavyweight either. We got out the door, everything was fine, but he de-arched a little during his practice ripcord pulls and went head down somewhat. That makes you increase your speed. I was flung across his back and was about 50 feet above and away from him and Frank when I recovered. By the time I managed to get close to them again it was pull time.  I discussed it with Jon; he suggests I wear a tee-shirt and shorts next time I do a skydive with someone that heavy. Personally I would just rather not skydive with someone that heavy: it's a matter of physics. Take a 240 pound human who is spinning at a rate of 2 revolutions a second with a fall rate of 140 miles an hour. Do you really think a 130 pound human is going to be able to stop the spinner? Much less fall at 140 miles an hour (my fall rate is more like 110) without tying an anvil around her waist.  My second student from Heck was a woman who weighs less than me. It was a Level 1 AFF and again, the other jumpmaster was Frank. We got out the door just fine and she had a really good body position, which is rare in a beginner. She did not do her practice ripcord pulls, so I gave her the signal to start them. She just stared at me. So I took her hand and pulled it behind her back, and she got the hint and grabbed the pilot chute's handle. I *thought* she understood. She pulled the pilot chute out and opened at about 10,000 feet. (Normally students open at 5,000; experienced skydivers can go as low as 2000).   What a long cold ride. She had no idea what she did wrong. She basically lost altitude awareness; we teach them that the skydive is over at 5,500 feet and not before then. She was very discouraged. I hate seeing that. I'd rather them lose altitude awareness and pull high as opposed to pulling low. I tried to talk her into going again. I doubt she'll be back which is a shame.  For the first time in a while I'm reading a book  A Game of Thrones , by George R.R. Martin. It's a fairly typical fantasy epic, except with a decent amount of kinky sex and non-cartoon violence and some interesting, 3 dimensional characters. It's a projected series of 6 books and only the first three have been written. Like many compulsive fantasy readers, I have given up on Robert Jordan's  The Wheel of Time  series so I'm hoping this series will not disappoint me like Jordan's did.

       The new Batman  movie has started filming. Some photos have popped up on the web:  urlLink go here  especially if you are a Christian fan. No batsuit photos; just him being Bruce Wayne. And I have heard all the "Bateman" jokes I care to, thankyouverymuch.  Judging by his face, he isn't on one of his severe body-altering diets.   I watched  urlLink The Patriot  last night, with ex-listee Mel Gibson and very much a listee Jason Isaacs (as the Evil Bad Guy). There's some pretty scenery in this movie, and some random acts of violence, but I could have done without all the cliches. This is one of those movies that I would have liked to have played script doctor on. Why make the Evil Bad Guy such a cartoon? Couldn't he and Gibson's Benjamin Martin come to be antagonists simply because they were on different sides? Why the snidely whiplash behavior (burns the house, shoots wounded Colonial soldiers AND one of Martin's sons)? The movie also had  Tchéky Karyo, a french actor whose name I can't pronounce but can always count on for an interesting character. And Chris Cooper (always interesting characters, far more pronouncable name).   urlLink Bundling,  by the way, is a real custom.  Why oh why is there mention of Orlando Bloom and James Bond in the same sentence? Clive Owen and Colin Firth at least have that generic handsome British man thing going for them. Bloom is a puppy! Great elves do not make great James Bonds. Hell, Hugh Jackman rumors make more sense to me.   I've mentioned  this before; when I become smitten by an actor, I do research on the web. I try to tell myself it's only to glean info on his movies, but that's partially horseshit. I do have a interest in the person himself. For the most part, I research then I leave. Occasionally though I find a fairly interesting fan community. Jason Isaacs is one of my favorite  urlLink and the only one  that I'm an active member of. I dig the people on the message board. Mostly older women but occasionally younger; they refer to themselves sometimes as a 'sewing circle'. There are topics that are strictly prohibited, especially any sexual in nature (although posts about how 'hot' a character or the actor himself are okay as long as they don't go into masturbatory detail). And if you want to be tarred and feathered, then run out on a rail, constantly use bad grammar and insult Mr. Isaac's family.   He occasionally reads the message boards, too. I'm sure it's a bit mind-bending and an ego rush to visit a community based around you.  I'm not active, but I subscribe to a fan mailing list for Damian Lewis. I stay subscribed because their community is a hoot, as well. Again, I'm struck by the older nature of the fans (the photo section has one area where fans post pictures of themselves with the actor) which is surprising because Lewis is in his early 30's (I want to say 32). There isn't so much self-regulating censorship here, but it hasn't really been needed that I've seen. People are more open about their feelings towards the actor (they refer to themselves as 'gutter bunnies' and once sent Lewis a huge boxful of ladies' underwear) but no one gets gross and I have yet to see a flame war erupt. I have been kept in stitches by all the stories of women whose husbands are curious about their sudden interest in World War II.  I have never met any celebrity beyond the occasional local news personality. I have seen some - when the Braves all of a sudden learned how to play baseball in the early 90's Fulton County stadium was crawling with them. Emilio Esteves was in town filming  Freejack  and he and his brother Charlie Sheen showed up once when the Cardinals (or was it the Reds?) were in town. My sister Andrea jabbed me in the ribs with an elbow when Sheen skulked past our seats wearing sunglasses and a ballcap. She whispered excitedly "Hey! That's Charlie Sheen!!" My thoughts were, "so?" Not impressed.  The late Gregory Hines came to a ballgame and he smiled and waved at people who were pointing at him. He was cool.   Arnold Swarzenneger and wife came to the stadium once. 6 foot 3 inch John Smoltz walked up to him and shook his hand; I was struck by how *short* arnold is. I'd put him somewhere between 5'6" and 5'8".  But anyway, I'm leading up to a point: would I want to ever meet an actor I admire/love/drool over? No; what if he was in a bad mood or something? I'm such a wuss. Well, if I ever could, I'd buy Bill Paxton a beer. He's such a hoot.

       Windy Sunday.   I seem to have developed an affliction for  Linkin Park .  Crawling in my skin These wounds they will not heal Fear is how I fall Confusing what is real   Man, if I were 19 I would have thought that was sooooo deep. Still,  Linkin Park  has everything I love: lots of angst, lots of anger, a bunch of shouting all with a nice beat.  Actually my favorite band for the last 6 or 7 years has been  Front Line Assembly  if I go by a) number of albums bought and b) the amount of time I listen to them. They're loud, angry, and have a good beat, too. The best thing about their albums is to figure out which science fiction movies they sample from.

      Quick note similar to yesterday: Georgia Skydive ads.  Go to Monroe, Rome, or Thomaston in Georgia for tandem skydiving. I don't much like the advertising practices of Cedartown. I'm not saying they aren't safe. I severely detest them implying that other dropzones (including mine) are not safe. We follow the same damn rules as they; I used to *work* at their dz and know they don't have anything in place to make their skydiving a safer experience than anywhere else in the known universe. And I don't care *what* their site says: people have gotten injured at their drop zone. It happens because it's skydiving. And it's not hearsay: I worked manifest there for a while and I'm the one who had to call 911 when someone busted a limb. This goes for experienced skydivers, AFF students, and tandem students.   Why the *hell* is my blog attracting ads for the only 2 dropzones on the face of the planet I have problems with? Guess I ought to shell out the money to pay for my own bandwidth. That will stop that. And then maybe I can post pictures.  In the meantime here's a link to a rather spiffy Alabama drop zone, if I do say so myself: ---------------->

       Editorial note:  I have noticed that Blogger puts ads above the free blogs. Hey, they have that right. At least they are unobtrusive.  But if you see the one for  Skydive Las Vegas  up there; let me tell you this: they suck. Why?  urlLink Because of this policy . They are what we call a Tandem Factory. If you feel like doing a tandem, go to a drop zone that does not ban experienced jumpers. Tandems in my opinion do not give you the real experience of skydiving - it's even worse if all you do is go to a drop zone and meet no one but other tandem passengers. At least at a normal drop zone you might pick up what a little more of what skydiving is about.  SLV's owner has every right to run his dz the way he see fits. I just think it sucks. EOM.

       Yeagh. Bleah.  Note to myself: I never want to go on vacation to an area whose main attractions are Casinos.  Last night I flew with my husband and his flight instructor to Tunica, Mississippi. Why? Jon needs a night time cross-country flight (greater than 100 miles) for his commercial pilot's rating. We rented a retractable gear Cessna 182 and off we went.   Many people love gambling; I saw a bunch of folks there having the time of their lives. Me, I felt like someone had put a vacuum hose into one of my pockets. One-armed bandit: oooOOOOoooh! NOW I get it! Eh, I know the odds and I allotted a small amount of money to gambling. I got so disgruntled I held back $40 and I'm going to take it and buy me a copy of  Neverwinter Nights , a relatively new computer role-playing game based on Dungeons and Dragons.  Actually, I enjoy blackjack but the tables were crowded and the blackjack machines were not as fun as the ones I played on St. John: I spent about 5 bucks; and 2 hours and 6 Amstel Lights later I had won back about 30 bucks. The booze is free in Tunica (and considering some of the dumbass betting I saw from hideously drunk men, that's a smart move by the casino), but flagging down someone to bring me a fer pete's sake Budweiser (hey, what do I want for free?) was annoying. Guess I don't look like a big tipper. Actually if the waiter/waitress does a good job I go plenty over 20%.   But anyways we flew back at about 3am and my eyes were almost puffed shut from cigarette smoke. Yes, casinos are about the last place a smoker can go and light up. I don't begrudge them this priveledge; they can have the casinos. I won't be back any time soon.  Here's a web site to  urlLink El Yunque , the rain forest in Puerto Rico; and here is a web site to  urlLink Culebra and Vieques , two islands off the east coast of PR. Vieques might sound familiar; the U.S. Navy used part of Vieques as a practice bombing range since WWII. A resident was killed in a training accident in 1999 so many people came together and protested the Navy's presence. The Navy stopped, and I read today that the Navy presence has almost completely left Puerto Rico. This means that Roosevelt Roads has closed. I congradulate the people who stopped the shelling; Vieques is a beautiful place and now it can be completely cleaned up and rightfully claim its place as a jewel of the Caribbean. I also know a lot of people lost jobs because of the base closing; I hope they can find jobs and a better use for that land.

       Woo-hoo!  Last night on the  Jack Bauer Power Hour : More Evil Women! Sweet! And a  urlLink Platoon  reunion, featuring Francesco Quinn and Kevin Dillon. I guess Johnny Depp was too busy being a gay pirate at that time.  Those episodes of  24  were eerily timely; torture aplenty was going on all over the place. To be honest, beating the crap out of someone who knows where a bomb is going off doesn't bother me. Threatening his family, though, ugh. I *do* like the solution they came up with - Industrial Light and Magic might become subcontractors for the Military Intelligence branches of the armed forces. For a moment, I thought Bauer had put the ultraviolet into black ops.  Since I'm all out of  24  disks, I'll have to watch something else tonight. I've been itching to watch more of  the Office , the BBC comedy. Despite the accents the British apparently have the same type of office culture we have here. The kid who was in the British equivalent of the National Guard has me rolling most of the time. "I'm the assistant regional manager!" - "You're the assistant  to  the regional manager!" And like a lot of BBC programming, it gets away with stuff you just won't see on the networks. The huge inflatable penis, for instance.    I guess  I need to go see  urlLink Shrek 2 . Considering how much of a hit  Finding Nemo  was last year and the strong box office  Shrek 2  is doing, I have a feeling we're going to see more goofy animated films. The moral of this story, studio heads, is this: if you want people to enjoy your movies, don't smack them so hard over their heads with political correctness!   Both  Shrek  and  Finding Nemo  had some, but it was good! Amidst the fart jokes, Lord Farqhuad (*heh*) and  "Eat me!"   Shrek  had a strong message about looks being in the eye of the beholder.  Finding Nemo  had a strong message about parenting, and not holding someone down because of his or her disability. Plus it had sharks on a 12 step program, bubbles, and "Mine. Mine! Mine? Mine!" Both movies were funny as hell and had a message without being pedantic. Whoops! I'm feelin a word of the day coming on!    pedantic   SYLLABICATION: pe·dan·tic  ADJECTIVE: Characterized by a narrow, often ostentatious concern for book learning and formal rules: a pedantic attention to details.

       Rolled in from another town, hit some gold too hot to settle down. But a fool and his money soon go separate ways and you found a fool lyin' in a daze. Ha Ha woman what you gonna do,  you destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you. It's so good that you're feelin' pain,  but you better get your face on board the very next train. Evil Woman,...     Yikes!  Jon and I spent 6 hours with Jack Bauer last night. Poop is a happenin, including the return of the Evil Women. That's one thing I love about the show; both of the protagonists have women antagonists who are downright scary. President Palmer's wife is rightly referred to as "Lady MacBeth" at  urlLink Television Without Pity . What a power-mad, manipulative, harridan! I really like her. I mean, I like to hate her. Then there's Our Lady of the Perpetual Bad Hair Day, (that's mine, not TWoP's), bleep, who bleeped bleep's -oh, hell. If you don't want to be spoiled, go elsewhere. Nina is a cold, ruthless, mercenary badass. Can't wait to see where they are going with her character. Maybe she'll kill Kim and gain  24 's devoted followers complete love and admiration.    By the  way, if you don't recognize those lyrics, you probably missed the 70's. I used to love ELO. Now I can't stand them. I can sing along with any of their songs, though. Even some of the really obscure shite off of their first 3 albums. I was amused by how many adverts all of a sudden started using "Mr. Blue Sky" a while back (including the ads for  Adaptation  which was really strange because that song wasn't in the movie).   Today we  found a squirrel, 2 robins, a duck, and a moose in the pool. I'm kidding; only the usual assortment of spiders and bugs in the skimmer. One of these days I'm going to actually have to swim in it...

       The post  office *finally* coughed up the first disk of  24 , season 2. Or as one forum wittily put it,  the Jack Bauer Power Hour .  That guy has one really long, rough day once a year. Think God has it out for him? Apparently; it just got renewed for a 4th season. This season has Jack running around L.A. looking for a nuclear bomb. I liked it in the first ep where he kills a man to get close to a suspect. He responds to Mason's shock with something like "you guys want results but you never want to get your hands dirty." Heh. He just put the black into black ops. Mason's still a spineless creep; Tony still looks put-upon. And Kim's still whiny, but she's a chip off the old block when it comes to action. And Democrat, schmemocrat. I'd vote for someone with President Palmer's integrity, any election year.   Pulled out  of our Dead Pool the other day: a big fat hairy dead rat. Can someone explain why some  rat  would all of a sudden try to go swimming? Maybe he was just leaning over for a drink and he slipped. Still, ewww.   Acid reflux  is now under control. I'm taking Prilosec right now. Nothing like burning up your own esophagus. About a year ago I had an endoscopy to see if I had a hiatal hernia. Thank goodness, no. The doctor put me under and when I woke up, I remember being incredibly happy. That was some awesome anaethetic! Unlike the time I had my wisdom teeth removed and I woke up depressed and crying. It could have been the pain, though.    I have  a friend whose sister just got into a car wreck. She had a head on collision with another car, and she was high. Plus the police found drugs in her car. I wish drugs were legal, but they're *not*; and they are a stupid, stupid way or ruining your life. I'm not talking about addiction, I'm talking about legality. I hope the other driver pulls through; otherwise we're looking at vehicular homicide. Stupid, stupid, stupid!   Happy belated  birthday to Nancy. Hope the kid settles down soon. She wrote about her kid's tantrums on her blog recently; I went and found my onery, decrepit old kitty and gave her a lot of pets out of gratitude.   I am  still going to the gym. I loathe the cardio stuff. Still love the weight lifting, though. Why, oh why does food taste so damn yummy?

       The post  office lost disk 1 of Season 2 of  24  (curse their hides), so I channel surfed most of last night. Highlights included the "Good Old Blues Brothers Boys" sequence from  urlLink The Blues Brothers , one of the finest movies based on an SNL skit. Am I damning it with faint praise? I love their rendition of "Stand By Your Man" ("bay-beh!"). I'm echoing a friend's sentiments here (hi, Nancy!): I miss the skinny, uptight Dan Ackroyd.  Then I watched  Mail Call , the program R. Lee Ermey hosts on the Hitler Channel. It's an enjoyable program on military hardware. This episode perked my interest because he did a tandem skydive with members of the U.S. Army's Parachute Team, the Golden Knights. Hell, I'd be a hot skydiver, too, if I got to jump on the taxpayer's dollar, whine whine whine. Well, they do a lot of demos which can't hurt our sport.  For the most part. Some members of the Golden Knights were to do a demonstration jump into the Huntsville International Airport for a huge airshow. They had to cancel because a few weeks earlier, quite a few of them got injured jumping into a race track in extremely high, gusty winds. That was a dumbass thing to do; it puts a black eye on our sport as well as gets people killed. And not just jumpers. People have been injured because a skydiver landed on them. I sincerely hope reprimands aplenty were administered for that stunt.  The followup is our drop zone was asked to fill in. We were happy to do so, although the airport were a bunch of tightwads towards us, especially since I know that the Golden Knights ain't cheap. I was told by some of our ground crew that the audience was told that the Golden Knights had to cancel because of the events over in Iraq. Sure, fine, whatever. In all honesty I guess the truth wouldn't have gone over too well: "The Golden Knights had to cancel because a bunch of them bounced like rubber biscuits on the last demo they did. To fill in, here's a completely different set of dumbasses!"  Aaaaanyway. I love it when skydiving is portrayed in a good light on T.V. so kudos to the Knights and Ermey for that segment. Have I ever told you how much I loathe  Real T.V. ? Every time I see a skydiving incident the narrators do *not* get the story straight. I'm sure the other sport incidents on that show are portrayed incorrectly, as well.  After  Mail Call , I watched a 30 minute segment about American propaganda during WWII. It was interesting and not surprising. Hell, it was propaganda. I'm looking forward to all their programming about D-Day that's coming up; the 60th anniversary of the invasion of Normandy is this year.  And then hey! It's  Band of Brothers  for the umpity umpth time! It was the episode  Crossroads , where Captain Winters is promoted to Battalion X.O. and is frustrated by all the boredom and paperwork. The ep prominently features a lot of Damian Lewis, including a partially nekkid DL, so yeah I watched it again. For the umpity umpth time.  The Hitler channel rules!

       What a  nice weekend! Nice and hot. I love Alabama seasons. Winter sucks, but it only lasts through January and part of February. Spring can last any where from two months to two weeks, but it's windy and wet and usually every night we're woken up by the damn weather alert radio. Summer is deadly hot and humid, but Fall rocks. And it usually lasts until December 31st, around 11:30 pm. You think I'm kidding.  This weekend at the drop zone we had a coaches course. A rated Coach is the first rung on the ladder o' instruction. All student skydivers after AFF must be supervised by someone who at least has a coach rating until they get their license. A coach must have at least a B license and 100 skydives and must pass this course. What's annoying about this setup is I can let someone who has 100 skydives and the coach's rating jump with a student but not someone who doesn't have the rating but has thousands of jumps.   Fortunately that condition is waiverable but it still chaps my hide.  What was fun for me is I got to help out with the coach candidate's freefall skills tests. Which means I got to play the Student From Hell. Hey, I went through that course; and the Accelerated Freefall Instructor course, which is 1000 times worse. The candidates were all over-amping on everything so it's always fun to gig them on stupid things, like wearing your helmet backwards or putting your altimeter on the wrong hand. Or 'slipping' off the airplane so they would have to chase you out the door. Best fun I ever had at someone else's (literal) expense.  I also had 3 AFF dives, which are their own form of fun. Remind me: I need to learn my left from my right.  My brother Ed FINALLY got his A license. He also did his 100th jump which means he got pied. This weekend's theme for me was apparantly 'revenge week'.  Here's a three-fer for word o the day. I looked up this word after reading a column this morning:    semiotic   SYLLABICATION: se·mi·ot·ic  VARIANT FORMS: also se·mi·ot·i·cal (--kl) se·mei·ot·ic (sm-, sm-, sm-) also se·mei·ot·i·cal (--kl)   ADJECTIVE: 1.

ETYMOLOGY: Greek smeitikos, observant of signs, significant, from smeisis, indication, from smeioun, to signal, to interpret as a sign, from smeion, sign, from sma.  OTHER FORMS: semi·oti·cal·ly —ADVERB   And just for clarification I looked up this one:     semantics    SYLLABICATION: se·man·tics  NOUN: (used with a sing. or pl. verb) 1.

       A love that's love and not fade away     My body  decided to give me a 40th birthday present: My acid reflux has returned with a vengeance. I won't go into gross anatomical detail; let's just say I know how John Hurt felt in  Alien    Guess what  I saw Wednesday night? It is in reference to the Buddy Holly quote above. Yep, I actually saw the series end of  Angel . Quit now lest ye be spoiled.  Anyway, I was channel surfing, and saw Angel talking to Leslie. I didn't recognize the episode; then I realized it was season 5! I checked the TiVo guide - it claimed I was watching a show called "I got sucked into an airplane engine, but I'm still alive!!" You think I'm kidding.  I cried when Wesley died. I always like the resident weenie, and he made a good one. Goodbye, rogue demon-hunter! My first thought was he died ineffectually, but on the other hand he did something remarkable by creating feelings in Ilyria. Her concern for him made her show up and finish the job he was supposed to do (in spectacular fashion!). I also realize that what remains of Team Angel don't stand a snowball's chance in Hell, but with a grief-stricken Ilyria plus a Hamilton-charged Angel, maybe they stand a teeny chance. One consoling thought I have is that there is indeed a Heaven in the Buffyverse.  And I'm so glad that William the Bloody finally found an appreciative audience for his poetry.  And in honor of Spike, heres my word of the day:    effulgent    SYLLABICATION: ef·ful·gent  ADJECTIVE: Shining brilliantly; resplendent.  ETYMOLOGY: Latin effulgns, effulgent-, present participle of effulgre, to shine out : ex-, ex- + fulgre, to shine;

       Jon and  I saw  urlLink Troy  last night. In a nutshell: it was good, but not great.  The movie was based somewhat on  The Iliad . Some people bitched about there being no gods or supernatural elements in the story. I was quite happy that the screenwriter did away with those elements. Achilles is much more of a badass because he's *not* immune to weapons.  A quick synopsis: Princes Hector (Eric Bana) and Paris (Orlando Bloom) of Troy are visiting king Melenaus (Brendan Gleeson) finishing up a peace treaty. During their stay Paris and the king's wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), fall in love so he smuggles her on board their ship when they return. A pissed-off Melenaus asks his brother, king Agamemnon (Brian Cox) to help him get Helen back. Agamemnon has always wanted to invade Troy so he seizes this opportunity. Both brothers gather a huge invasion force that includes king Odysseus (Sean Bean) and warlord Achilles (Brad Pitt) and his myrmidons. Many battles ensue.  I loved the casting, although except for a cameo by Julie Christie and a priestess of Apollo named Briseis, the women in the story weren't that interesting. Helen was pretty, but in a vague sorority girl way. Cynical me also thinks that all of the other women's roles were chosen by the criteria that all of the other actresses couldn't be as pretty as Diane Kruger. Whatever. Briseis (Rose Byrne) had a lot more personality anyway.  The men's casting was dead on. Achilles is supposed to be pretty, vain, impetuous, and androgynous. And a badass. Brad Pitt spent a lot of the movie nekkid, which is fine with me. I don't particularly care one way or the other about his face, but dang those are some nice glutes. And pecs. And what a gun show! Same with Bana, though I like his face. Didn't care much for the beard. And speaking of Prince Hector, Bana played him as loving, loyal, intelligent, with a strong sense of duty. And Paris was a weak puppy fool for love. Agamemnon is a greedy powermad bastard, Odysseus is a charming, crafty, likeable man. Jest like the book.  It's a tragedy, of course. I had a few eye leak problems when King Priam (Peter O'Toole) goes to Achilles' tent to beg him for his son's body. It was a powerfully sad moment in the translation I read and O'Toole did a great job with this scene. The thing I liked best about this movie is like all good tragedies, it is tragic because you can look down the chain of events and point out places again and again where things could have happened different if only...  And I note that if this wasn't the story about the fall of Troy, modern day audiences would have died laughing at the Trojan Horse. No one would ever be able to accept just how dumbass the Trojan people behaved by letting it into the city walls. Apparently the collective I.Q. of the city dropped sharply when Prince Hector was killed. If that was a spoiler shame on you for not reading your Iliad.  In honor of Homer, word o' the day:    Myrmidon   SYLLABICATION: Myr·mi·don   NOUN: 1. Greek Mythology A member of a warlike Thessalian people who were ruled by Achilles and followed him on the expedition against Troy.  2. myrmidon A faithful follower who carries out orders without question.   ETYMOLOGY: From Middle English Mirmidones, Myrmidons, from Latin Myrmidones, from Greek Murmidones.

       Arg.  Back in the grind after a mini-vacation. Have I mentioned to you lately that I don't like my job?   I see  my kitty filled you in on the pertinent details of Friday's party. No one called the cops, so I guess we didn't get too loud. Not much to add; I received some pretty kewl loot, including an assortment of dried peppers, 2 bottles of Merlot, a bunch of Guinness, and some books. And a really nifty photo album one of our skydivers put together for me. Man I wish I could post photos.   Saturday  I managed to get my 1000th jump. Yay! I finally made it. I got pied for my efforts. It is a skydiving tradition to get a face full of whip cream - nay, my body was coated in sweet sticky goo. Bleah. Drank too much again; I'm going to have to cut back soon.    I did  nothing on Sunday and I loved it! I did drag out  Civilization III  and whupped up on India, France, and Greece for a while. I'd rather not whup up on the Romans, Germans, or Japanese. They're mean! Although a pissed-off Mahatma Ghandi is a sight to behold.    Monday I  did my 1001th jump. Jon, Steve, Harold and I did a demonstration jump into the Huntsville International Airport. One of the runways had been extended in a project to allow really super heavy planes to land and the jump was part of the opening ceremony. The runway is now over 13,000 feet long. You know, that's as long as our altitude for skydives. Damn that's a lot of tarmac!  Jon is always harping on his demo jumpers to look and act professional. So what happens? He is standing next to Steve during a photo op moment (a cutting of a banner) and he responds to something Steve says by saying "Steve, you are *so* gay!" And guess who is standing behind him biting her tongue? The mayor of Huntsville!  We finally finished season 1 of  24 ! I had no idea bleep was the mole! And oh my god poor bleep! I am glad bleep is dumping bleep, though. What a power-hungry bleep! I'm looking forward to season 2. We better find out what was up with bleep the mole; they didn't exactly fill in the details when bleep shot bleep.   Bleep this. I have some work to do. Have I mentioned to you lately that I don't like my job?

       Guess how  many baby birds I found in the pool filter today?  Any way, I don't feel much like writing.   Oh, Yeah:    Happy Birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday Bill Paxton (and Trent Reznor and Dennis Hopper), Happy birthday to you!!!!

       Vasquez:  Hi everyone. Mom is busily working on some of her birthday presents. You wouldn't believe how many people bought her Guinness Stout in a can. On second thought, maybe you would.   Big Fat Kitty: M-m-meow?   Vasquez: What? Jeez, it's okay you tubby mook! They all left yesterday morning! Sheesh. Mom locked me and fatboy up in the attic because of the party Friday. He's still somewhat psychotic. Me, I'm pissed. All those people and I didn't get enough pets.   Big Fat Kitty:  Meow. I want to go sit with the tupperware.   Vasquez:  WHAT? Fine, hide in the cupboard. I watched out the window. There must have been 40+ people here on Friday. Mom sat with some old college friends. I remember them, they were nice. They all petted me. Mom got thrown in the pool.   Big Fat Kitty:  Meow!?! - Ooooooooooooh! What's that?   Vasquez:  Hey lardbutt, leave the trash alone. Wait- chicken bones? Mmmm... Hang on a bit folks!  (later)   Vasquez:  *burp* Meow, but I love chicken! Mom grilled some Friday night. It didn't go over as well as the ribs she cooked but I like it just fine. And I was so happy; some of their guests came and slept up in the attic with us! Stupid blubberboy went nuts and tried to open the door with his head. Several Times. What a dumbass.    Big Fat Kitty:  Meow!   Vasquez:  WHAT! SPEAK UP, GATO GORDITO!!! Damn, he's an idiot! He snuck out and slept with the plasticware instead of all these warm, 98.6 degree human bodies. What a pussy!

       Wet Thursday.  I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow, but the forecast isn't perfect. Oh, well; we're going to be renting a tent anyway.    We bought  my present, a big honking charcoal grill. It's being 'seasoned' right now; I will be grilling the ribs for tomorrow tonight.    I'm getting  amped up for  urlLink Troy . I'd go see a costume epic no matter who is in it, but this movie has a great cast including listee Eric Bana.   Now there's an interesting contrast. I have no idea what attracts me to a man. Physically, Bana and Damian Lewis have nothing in common. Jeez, I need to post pictures. Lewis is an old blood Brit; tall, lanky, red haired and blue eyed, with the freckled white skin to match. Bana is the muscularly built son of Croatian and German immigrants (he was born in Australia); swarthy with dark hair and brown eyes. Lewis attended Eaton, went to college and is a classically trained actor. Bana graduated high school, he's a motorhead who has a knack for impressions and became a stand-up comic before deciding to act. Lewis is a notorious boozer and slamhound; Bana's a devoted family man (I have yet to see/read an interview with him where he hasn't mentioned his family).  These two have *nothing* in common whatsoever, except that they are both damn good, under-appreciated actors. And they make my ovaries flutter. You know, that sounds painful.   Nothing much  else to comment on today; I am purposefully staying away from political commentary. Blah. Not that my little highschool girl crushes hold much interest. Well, let me put it this way: thinking about a cute actor makes me happy (among other things). Thinking about politicians gets me pissed. I'd rather be happy than pissed. If you want to know why America seems obsessed with bullshit instead of things that matter, you don't have to look much further than this paragraph.   I need  to change the name of my blog. I'm trying to think of something catchy. Hope you like the new design.

       No update  yesterday because I was busy busy busy. I ran out of here after a bitch of a day at work (another pernicious bug) and did three AFF jumps at the DZ. Got out of there by 9pm.  Got home after some food and checked what TiVo had grabbed for me. I was delighted to see it had recorded the Pierce Brosnan version of  Robinson Crusoe  for me, because you-know-who had a small part in it.  He died before the opening credits. So I turned it off and went to bed.   Here's a  link to a news story about our  urlLink skydiving grandmother    Monday we  watched 4 more episodes of 24. I'm enjoying them, but they trotted out the Amnesia trick pretty doggone early in the series's lifetime. And a car exploded from rolling down a hill. That descends from cheese to schlock, but hey not all the episodes can be tightwire exciting.    I'm off  to stamp out bugs. I must have this stuff done by Friday, Or Else. So in closing, I bring you these words of wisdom from Steve Martin:   Be courteous, kind and forgiving,  Be gentle and peaceful each day,  Be warm and human and grateful,  And have a good thing to say.   Be thoughtful and trustful and childlike,  Be witty and happy and wise,  Be honest and love all your neighbours,  Be obsequious, purple, and clairvoyant.   Be pompus, obese, and eat cactus,  Be dull, and boring, and omnipresent,  Criticize things you don't know about,  Be oblong and have your knees removed.   Be tasteless, rude, and offensive,  Live in a swamp and be three dimentional,  Put a live chicken in your underwear,  Get all excited and go to a yawning festival.   O.K. everybody!  Be courteous, kind and forgiving,  Be gentle and peaceful each day,  Be warm and human and grateful,  And have a good thing to say.   Be thoughtful and trustful and childlike,  (O.K. everybody on this!)  Be witty and happy and wise,  Be honest and love all your neighbours,  Be obsequious, purple, and clairvoyant.  (Let 'em hear you outside!)   Be pompus, obese, and eat cactus,  (Everybody sing!)  Be dull, and boring, and omnipresent,  Criticize things you don't know about,  Be oblong and have your knees removed.   (Ladies only)  Be tasteless, rude, and offensive,  (Now the men)  Live in a swamp and be three dimentional,  (Everybody)  Put a live chicken in your underwear,  Go into a closet and suck eggs.

       What a  long weekend. The drop zone was busy on Saturday; many tandem passengers and accelerated freefall students. I jumped 8 times, 4 of those were AFF. 3 of those jumps were with the same student, Michael, who looks to be about 30. Ex-ranger, although he seems more goofy than most ex-rangers I have known. That was a compliment, by the way.  I did his level 5,6, and 7 with him, and was happy to pass him on all three. Passing level 7 means graduating from the AFF program. He's still a student, but he can jump by himself now. He has a bunch of things he has to do to to get his basic "A" license. Poor bastard doesn't know he's going to be my guinea pig for a structured program I'm working on to get newly graduated students intermediate freefall skills to fly with other skydivers (as opposed to learning these skills haphazardly, like I did).  My other AFF jump was a level 1. Good kid. What was neat was his 81 year old grandmother did an AFF jump, too. I was a little annoyed by how many people came up to me and asked me if I was going to 'allow' her to jump. WTF? First off, I didn't teach the ground school, JK did, and he's been skydiving for over 20 years so I expect him to make any judgement call. And where were all those concerned skydivers when I taught that elder gentleman whose skydive nearly ended in disaster? I smell a little sexism.  Any way, I let that man jump  because that was his choice . He wasn't senile, he was old. I spelled it out to him and he still wanted to skydive. JK and Jon took the old lady on the jump, and she did okay and landed fine.    I was  reviewing my log book; I received my AFF Intructor's certificate May 8th of last year. In the last year I have done 102 AFF skydives, about 225 skydives total. That total is the most I have ever done in a 12 month span, but of course you can jump more if someone else is paying you. I get $30 for every AFF, by the way. Considering this weekend I did a total of 7 AFF jumps, you can see why I am reluctant to work overtime at my normal job (especially since I have to work 8 hours overtime for free before I get paid straight time. Fie on that).  So anyway, I now have done a grand total of 994 skydives. Barring weather, I don't see why I can't get 6 more by next Monday.  Today's word:   pernicious   SYLLABICATION: per·ni·cious   ADJECTIVE: 1a. Tending to cause death or serious injury; deadly: a pernicious virus. b. Causing great harm; destructive: pernicious rumors. 2. Archaic Evil; wicked.   ETYMOLOGY: Middle English, from Old French pernicios, from Latin pernicisus, from pernicis, destruction : per-, per- + nex, nec-, violent death;      Just because I used it in a sentence today and my husband gave me a funny look. I was referring to a bug in an application here at work.

       There's a  festive poster on a door here at work that reads:   Only Positive Attitudes Beyond This Point! . I am itching to make up a little sign that says  Or Else  and tack it onto the bottom. Just can't seem to find the energy.  My husband's favorite joke: What did the fish say when he hit the wall? Damn.   Nancy's friend ,  urlLink Hally , has honored me today with a musical tribute to my obsession with the changing zoology of my swimming hole. Laughed my ass off, which if you live in a cubicle like I do, can make other denizens curious.    I haven't  done a top 10 list in a while. Here is my top 10 movies with a libertarian theme (no particular order):    urlLink Gattaca   This movie is one of those that celebrates the human spirit. This science fiction film extrapolates the ideas of genetic manipulation. Ethan Hawke plays a man born of genetic randomness - and because he has a heart defect, society considers him defective (or an in-valid). He doesn't buy into   that and with the help of a genetically perfect man (Jude Law) who was paralyzed in an accident, sets out to achieve his goals in life. Low budget but does a great job of conveying its themes.    urlLink Traffic   The ultimate condemnation on the stupid drug war and why we are losing. Fascinating, with a great cast. Topher Grace's speech caps it. Really!    urlLink People vs. Larry Flynt   Larry Flynt is a scumbag, and  Hustler  is a disgusting magazine. And he has every right to publish it. Ed Norton as Flynt's put-upon lawyer is the best thing about this movie.    urlLink Tucker:The Man and his dream   This movie is about a man who had some great ideas about automobiles and challenged the giant automaking corporations and lost. A good example of what happens to innovation when Big Industry collaborates with Big Government.    urlLink Other People's Money   When I watched this movie, I was expecting Danny DeVito's greedy corporate raider to get his comuppance. The movie cops out a little at the end, but I was gobsmacked by one occurence: DeVito is engineering a hostile takeover of a company and its owner (Gregory Peck) is trying to stop him basically for the sake of the employees and their community. And the movie allows DeVito's character to prove why he's *right* to do what he does!     urlLink Rollerball   Odd that I have 2 Norman Jewison movies here. Nontheless, this movie isn't perfect. I didn't *like* James Caan's character. In the future, there are no more cities or states; merely humungous corporations. Rollerball is a game to appease the masses. Caan plays Jonathan E, the best damn player to ever play. The hero-worship of his character troubles the Corporate leaders and they try to get him to retire. He refuses, so they change the rules of the game. This movie is another about the strength of the individual. Could have been better.    urlLink Demolition Man   I have a soft spot in my brain for this cheesy movie. In the future (funny how a lot of science fiction is on this list) there is no crime because everyone is lojacked. Unfortunately, a criminal (Wesley Snipes) who was frozen in the past (an economical way to incarcerate criminals) gets freed into this utopian future, so the leaders unfreeze another criminal, an ex-law enforcement official (Sylvester Stallone), to go after him. This movie contains a lot of jabs at political correctness and censorship. Plus it has Denis Leary commentary on steak and gravy fries.    urlLink Brazil   All libertarians know that True Evil does not wear the face of a Hannibal Lecter, Ted Bundy, or even (que reverb) Satan. It is the stupidity of faceless, banal bereacracy where people's lives get ground up because of mistakes, and other people become criminals because they simply can't comply with all the rules and regulations that exist.     urlLink The Edge   I have yet to see this movie on a libertarian list. It surprises me, because there are some strong themes here. For one thing, Anthony Hopkins is the protagonist and he plays a millionaire businessman. Shock number 1, he didn't become rich by exploitation, trust funds, or just sheer Eeevilness. He is obviously super-smart and made his money by using his brain. Imagine that!   He has a trophy bride wife; he's oblivious to the fact that she married him for his money. She is a model and is having an affair with a photographer (One of the Baldwin Brothers. I'm always confusing them. Alec?). Anyway, this guy is envious of the man's money.Hopkins and Baldwin are thrown together in a bad situation: the airplane they are in gets downed deep in a forest and they are a long way away from any civilization. Baldwin sees this as a chance to murder Hokins and gain possession of everything he owns. But he *can't* kill him right away, because Hopkins possesses a lot of knowledge about survival because he reads a lot of books; and because he's a businessman he knows how to solve problems.  He is Baldwin's only hope of making it out alive.  Shock 2: The concept of someone being jealous of someone else's success, scheming to take it from him, but depending on him for everything. This is more of an Objectivist theme than anything. Shocked that this made it into a movie, that's all.    urlLink Minority Report   In the future blah blah blah. On this list because it hits on something near and dear to my heart. Here's a troubling philosophy question for you: Would you advocate the enslavement of a few people to save the lives of thousands? Millions? Three precognitive humans see murders before they happen. The police use this information to arrest the murderers before they can commit their crimes. Tom Cruise is a police officer who leads these pre-crime raids, and chaos ensues when he starts working on a case where he realizes the precogs have seen him commit a murder. For the record, no; I can't possibly advocate that. Human beings are not the means to someone else's ends. If I say it's okay to turn someone else into a tool, then I'm telling the world it's okay if they want to turn me into a tool. I'm quite parsimonious in my beliefs; there is no excuse for slavery of any kind, even if millions have to suffer.  That word will be my vocabulary word-o-the-day:    parsimonious    SYLLABICATION: par·si·mo·ni·ous  ADJECTIVE: Excessively sparing or frugal.

       I have  decided not to spoil myself for  24 ; the best part of the series is the tension. We watched 3 more episodes last night and I was sorely tempted to watch the 4th but we needed to get to bed. At least we'll have something to watch tonight. Then I can get to that episode of  Poirot  I taped off the Biography channel. Don't ask.   In conjunction  with  24 , today's vocabulary word is:    verisimilitude  SYLLABICATION: ver·i·si·mil·i·tude   NOUN: 1. The quality of appearing to be true or real.  2. Something that has the appearance of being true or real.   ETYMOLOGY: Latin vrsimilitd, from vrsimilis, verisimilar. See verisimilar.     I learned this word by reading a fascinating set of books by Harlan Ellison:  urlLink The Glass Teat . It is about television - specifically it's a collection of essays about the late 60's early 70's t.v.  Okay, now I'm going to have to dig out my copies and read them again.  What does this have to do with anything? Writers have a tough job; they must research enough to maintain verisimilitude; but how much is enough? More than once while watching  24  (and a buttload of other shows and movies) I have scoffed at the B.S. they have computers do. I try to remember that most people are not aware of why computers behave the way they do, but since the computer is such an ubiquitous piece of equipment, writers should at least understand the basics. If a writer is going to write about castles, he should know the difference between a balustrade and a crenallation, a catwalk and a porticullis; if the writer is going to write about sailboats, he better know port from starboard and a jib from a spinnaker, etc. etc. etc. But I try to cut slack. For  24  I have had no problem ignoring some blatant tomfoolery because I have been glued to the edge of my seat for almost every episode.  The worst violator I have seen recently is  Swordfish ; the hacking scenes in this movie are downright hilarious. Any wannabe writers out there: hackers are most successful when they exploit the weakest link: the human being. Tricking someone out of their password it the oldest and easiest way of gaining access.   No animals  died in my swimming pool yesterday, but I did come home and found a couple of rug rats splashing around in it. A friend of ours, Steve, brought his two daughters, Sara and Megan, over for a swim. Cute kids. If I ever have a daughter I want one like Sara. She's fearless. She and Megan once rode in the King Air for a skydiving load. Megan (who's a little older) stayed glued to the copilot's chair, but Sara willingly sat by her dad next to the (plexiglass) door to look at the ground as it whizzed by. Steve isn't the world's most perfect man, but I cut him a lot of slack because he seems to genuinely care about his daughters and takes an active part in their lives (he's divorced).   Big Fat  Kitty wants to say meow to everyone out there, and Vasquez wants some food.

       Jon and  I watched another 4 episodes of  24 . We're both hooked; lots of intrigue, danger, and betrayal. Very little sex, but that's okay. Gotta feel bad for the lead character. I mean, what would you do if your family was kidnapped? I was thinking, "there's no way the kidnappers are going to let your family go, so you might as well tell them to go to hell", but on further review, how could he *not* do what he was told? Every moment he complies is another moment where his family gets to live, and another moment something might happen to free them.  I'm working hard not to go look at spoiler sites like  urlLink Television Without Pity  to find out what happens for the rest of the season. I've only seen 8 episodes, so there's 16 to go. Not to say something I'm sure a lot of people have already said, but it's going to be a long day.   I kegged  the beer yesterday. As I was siphoning it from the fermenter to the keg, I grabbed a small glass to taste. Nothing tastes off (hooray!) so it looks like I'll have drinkable beer by party time. It's Friday the 14th of May, by the way. If anyone within reading distance just happens to be in the vicinity of Hartselle, Alabama, email me and I'll send you directions. Jon's apparently been out twisting arms and it looks like a bunch of people are attending.   My birthday  present is going to be a big honking charcoal grill (Sam's Club is fresh out of ginger-headed british men. Nuts). Jon wants me to cook ribs on the grill for the big bash; I'm thinking yes, but I should grill other things as well. The best thing about birthdays is I get to make exactly the type of cake *I* want to eat. It will be chocolate, of course! Some asshat's going to stick 40 candles on it and set the house on fire. I can just see it.   Speaking of  ginger-boy, scuttlebut has it he's going to be in another British mini-series:  Colditz , which was a POW camp in Germany during WWII. This time he'll play a British officer. Looks like I'm going to have to harangue BBC America if I ever want to get to watch it. Maybe PBS will carry it. Why couldn't I have a thing for Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise? NooOOOoo, I have to go for the obscure ones.   Stupid animal  update: another frog got into the pool. Stupid frog. You know, I *like* frogs. I have eaten a lot of different types of animals, with no remorse. I have even had a stew made out of a cute and fluffy bunny and I didn't even blink an eye. But I had frog legs once, and I felt terrible. Poor frog. Yes, they tasted like chicken. So I'll stick to chicken.  We also have a small tree next to the pool. Jon cut it back some and discovered a bird's nest with eggs. Mama bird was chirping up a storm while Jon was doing this; we were afraid she would abandon the nest. She hasn't; the eggs have hatched. I hope they're old enough to fly away by the time we have that party. And if I find any dead baby birds in my pool I am going to go postal.

       Meow.   Vasquez:  Mom was uninspired and said us cats should write a bit for her blog. Can I have some food?   Big Fat Kitty:  Ooooh! What's that?   Vasquez: I'm sure there's some food around here. Oh, wait, my fur needs washing. *sluuuurp* *sluuuurp* *sluuuuuuurp* *sluuuurp*   Big Fat Kitty:  Oh, look! A glass with something in it! *Tink* *tink* *crash!* (sniff)(sniff) kool-ade, I think. Oooh, It made the carpet pink! Hey, Vasquez, your fur needs washing! *sluuuurp* *sluuuurp* *sluuuuuuurp* *sluuuurp*   Vasquez:  Get off! Dammit, fatass, let go of my head! I'll wash my own ears, dammit!    Big Fat Kitty  You are *no* fun!   Vasquez:  What? *sluuuurp* *sluuuurp* *sluuuuuuurp* *sluuuurp*   Big Fat Kitty:  I said 'You are no' - oooooooooh! What's that? Yay! Toilet paper!!! *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred**shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shred* *shreddity* *shreddity* *shred* *shred* *shred* *toss!*   Vasquez:  What? *sluuuurp* *sluuuurp* *sluuuuuuurp* *sluuuurp*

       Meh.  We sort of finished   10.5  last night. Actually we have the last 30 minutes to go. We had to get to sleep because we go to they gym on Tuesday mornings. Hey, I did 4 chin-ups! Well, I'm happy. Anyway, the movie was stupid. Stupid stupid stupid. But I suspect that the last 30 minutes has Los Angeles sliding off into the ocean, so that will be fun. TiVo rules, even if it seems to be recording every single episode of  Cops  with a scary sort of monomania.  No stupid animals tried to commit suicide yesterday. What a relief.

       Another rainy  weekend. I did get in 5 jumps, though. I have 18 jumps and 2 weekends to go for my nice round number.   What sucks  about rain are all the earthworms that get washed into our pool. It's not that hard to vacuum them up; they're small and they sink to the bottom. They also die, and that's a waste of a perfectly good earthworm. Stupid earthworms.  Yesterday Jon came into the house cradling a frog, saying "he didn't make it". Turns out the frog leapt into the pool and got sucked into the filter. Jon found him spinning around and around; the filter not strong enough to pull him under, but the frog not strong enough to swim away. Then the frog made a feeble attempt to leap out of Jon's hands, so we put him in the sink and gave him a gentle bath in not-so-chlorinated water. Then Jon took him outside and put him under a tree. Frog wasn't there this morning, so maybe he did make it, after all. Either that or he was an easy target for a hungry predator. Stupid frog.  Last night I was reading a book and all of a sudden I heard this mad twittering coming out of the fireplace. Some bird had gotten caught in the chimney. Because of the stove there is no opening big enough for the bird to fly all the way through; hopefully sometime in the night he flew back the way he came. Stupid bird.   The book  I was reading was  urlLink The Keep , a pulpy horror novel by F. Paul Wilson. Micheal Mann turned it into a  urlLink movie  w/ a great cast: Scott Glenn, Gabriel Byrne, Ian KcKellen and Jurgen Prochnow. I liked the movie until I read the book and realized Mann had sacrificed character for nifty photography. Stupid director.  The book is a swift read; it's about a bunch of German soldiers who get stationed in this small keep up in the Romanian mountains. One bored soldier decides someone has buried some treasure in the keep and finds and opens a secret door, letting out Something Eeevil. He gets killed and thereafter the other soldiers get killed off one a night. Considering that the soldiers die by having their throats ripped out (plus the fact they are stationed in Romania), they think they have unleashed a vampire. The German high command thinks otherwise, and sends a few squads of Storm Troopers to figure out what is going on. Toss in a mysterious protagonist who has a psychic connection to the keep, and two Romanian Jewish scholars who have knowledge of the area, and hilarity does not ensue.  This book is one of Wilson's earlier books. I really enjoy his Repairman Jack novels, as well. He wrote three sequels to  The Keep , which I have started to re-read. The sequels contain an apocalypse that would turn Joss Whedon green with envy.   Jon and  I watched the first part of  10.5 , which is as bad as it should be: a series of earthquakes on the west coast is causing major disasters and one dedicated scientist insists that they are merely precursors to The Big One, wherein California, Oregon, and Washington will receive new coast lines. Is that so bad? I don't really have to say it, but I will: Stupid TV show.

       I sympathize  with Lachelle about when she is asked "where are you from?". She said she has a hard time answering that question. Me too.   I was born in Kansas City, Missouri. We moved to Puerto Rico when I was three, so I don't consider myself "from" Missouri. We lived in three separate places in Puerto Rico - the one I remember best was Beach Tower, an apartment building on the Isla Verde beach strip (high tourist area). It was quite literally on the beach; I recall during some really nasty tropical storms an occasional ambitious wave would touch the ground floor. As fond as I am of the Caribbean and as much as I miss it, I am not "from" Puerto Rico.   We moved to Metro Atlanta when I was thirteen. We lived in Stone Mountain while I was in High School; when I went to College in Statesboro, Georgia, my mother moved to Norcross. When I got out of college (after an abortive attempt to attend graduate school at LSU), I moved in with my mother and didn't leave until the mid-90's when she re-married. I bopped around a few different apartment buildings until I met my husband and we moved in together in Decatur, Alabama. Now we live in Hartselle.  So the best guess would be "the South". But I'm not a southerner. *Sigh*. It is a tricky question. I usually answer "I lived most of my life in Atlanta". If they want more detail, I add the bit about Missouri and Puerto Rico.   Like most  people, I start my day with the internet. Unlike an old-fashioned newspaper, the internet allows you to pick and choose what you look at. Not that you can't skip the sports section in a newspaper, but I digress.  First I read the comics section: I am addicted to  urlLink Sluggy Freelance ,  urlLink General Protection Fault ,  urlLink Bruno the Bandit , and  urlLink Get Fuzzy .  Then I poke around in various blogs - my friends' (and their friends') stuff; then of course Lileks. I'm also fond of  urlLink Infinite Monkeys . I do read some news - mainly whatever Yahoo has on its main page.  I also visit some message boards - predominantly movie-oriented. I like the people on  urlLink Jabootu's Mad Movie Dimension . I also read  urlLink Chud's   messageboards, but there's a lot of noise on them. Still, it's a great site (Atlanta based!) for movie news.  Lastly, I read email. I have a Yahoo account where all my mail list mail goes to. I can usually blah blah through most of the posts but the occasional gold nugget shows up (Damian Lewis is going to be the lead in a love story! Yay!! It's a BBC TV production! Boo!!).  Then I visit  urlLink this site  and stare wistfully at the videocam picture of the Charlotte Amalie Harbor. I'll then go visit their USVI travel forum searching for some vicarious pleasure by reading someone's trip report. More often than not the posts consist of people asking the same things (do I have to rent a 4-wheel drive vehicle or can I walk everywhere on St. John? It's only 5 miles wide!) despite a FAQ and a search engine.   Then I try to think of something halfway interesting to write and I stick it here ---->X.

       Boo! My  allergies are back with a vengeance. My nose itches so bad it's bleeding. Icky. I will probably resume using Nasonex. And as Nancy pointed out to me, not being able to smell might help me with dieting.  After managing to maintain 130 for a long while, I have ballooned up to 143 this month. That's it, I can't take any more. Especially since my clothes are uncomfortable. Let the dieting commence (again)!   I had  an uninteresting weekend. I did one AFF jump Saturday; it took a while for the clouds to clear but one of the Tennessee kids from last weekend showed up and did his level 2. He did a great job; hope he comes and jumps again.  Sunday morning was a complete wash, so we watched the  urlLink South Park  movie. Love the show; love the movie. Parker and Stone (who won my undying love when they showed up at the Oscars wearing dresses one year) skewer just about every group there is; but the movie seemed to kick Canada ass the hardest. Well, actually, it seems to strike the hardest at people who want to blame their problems on everything but themselves, but Canada receives a sound whoopin for some reason. And deservedly so! In the movie the Prime Minister insists they apologized for Bryan Adams, but I don't recall hearing that apology.   Then I  whooped ass in  Civ III . I was tricked into getting into wars with Spain and Greece (by India), but I let them so I could land-grab. So now it's just me (Persia), the Vikings, and India. And Ghandi is looking kind of nervous. Or maybe just greedy.    But I  actually got to see a movie in a theater! urlLink Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban . I enjoyed it. I think it's the best of the 3 HP movies easily. It's also the first one I've seen since reading all the books, so I may be prejudiced. I wish that the movie would have explained some things; like why Harry's dad and 2 of his friends were Animagi (while one was a werewolf). Probably cut for time constraints - the damn thing is 2 hours and 21 minutes long as it is! Maybe it will be put in the DVD. Yes, the kids aren't going to win oscars, but I associate them pretty strongly with their roles now so I hope they continue. And yes, that hippogriff was an amazing piece of CGI (as was the whomping willow). Now I want to see the first 2 movies again.

       Hooray! My  nose is working better today. That onion bagel tasted/smelled terrific; as did my Rooibos tea. I have this honking big bottle of moisturizing lotion next to my computer at work; it smells like coconut and I can actually tell.   The loss of smell is wierd - the only thing I can relate it to is like if you have a loud ringing in your ears blocking out other noises or if you have been out in the sun for too long and you come indoors and can only see things in your peripheral vision for a few moments.    A huge  chunk of my after-work life has been taken up by  Civilization III:Conquests , an add-on to  Civ III  which I bought Tuesday. I notice the developers added some things from  Civ II , like bananas. Also the mountain chains might have volcanoes which might erupt during gameplay spreading pollution and killing workers/military units or city population. Also I get to build trebuchets, now. How nifty. Haven't had a chance to use one in battle yet but the Spanish are annoyed with me and are amassing troops near one of my cities. Jerks. We'll see how they like my crusaders marching on Madrid!    Pathetic.  I bet if I added up all the hours I have played any of the Sid Meier games (Civs I,II,III; Alpha Centauri, Master of Magic and Colonization), I bet at least one year of my life total has been wasted. But they're so damn fun!!   Link o' the day:   urlLink Cold Fusion Video , another b-movie site. The owner/operator is a devout Mormon. The only way I found out about that was by reading his   urlLink blog . He also hosts  urlLink  Zombie Mart .    Nancy linked  to an interesting site:  urlLink Women for Women International . I want to read more about them before I fork over any dough, but they seem to be a good cause. Ordinary people get their lives ripped apart in war zones; women have that extra added bonus of getting raped. Not that you have to be in a war zone to be raped, but I digress. I am very fortunate to be an American.

       For some  reason my brain is taking a nostalgic trip and it involves the first guy I ever fell in love with (who returned some of those emotions - to what extent I couldn't tell you).   Oh, to be young and psychotic again. Maybe not. I don't know if he knew it, but I worshipped the ground he walked on. I dated him in college. His mom didn't like me though (BITCH!) (man, can I hold a grudge, or what?) so there was little chance of a happily ever after scenario. Plus the fact that I found out he cheated on me one summer so I did the normal, 21 year old thing: I slept with a friend of his. And I'm not going to talk about how that all turned out. Let's just say I pretty much got exactly what I deserved.   Holy cabbage soup, I was an idiot. I miss being that passionate, but then again I don't miss being led around by the wrong body parts. Everyone else I dated pretty much falls into the "what was I thinking?" category, except for this nice Jewish guy. I gave him up because I was going back to college, where the aboveforementioned light-of-my-life-who-will-soon-crush-my-heart was waiting.  After a really slimy experience with a yahoo from New York, I quit dating for a long time. Then I met my true light-of-my-life (hi, Jon!). Jon is honest (too much so), cute, and makes me laugh. What the heck else could you want in a partner?

        10 random things, mostly movie-related:    Colin Farrell , who is good looking but not on my list, is complaining becase a full-frontal scene he did in some movie is being cut. I would like to add my voice of protest against slicing any wienies. Unless it's Harvey Keitel again. Seen enough of you, thanks.    Micturating  is a $2.50 way of saying "urinating". The things I learn from James Lileks!   Claritin and ephedrine  probably shouldn't be mixed.   The sequel  to  Dungeons & Dragons , a godawful movie, is purported to have Paris Hilton. I  will  watch, maybe even buy a DVD of this sequel, if someone assembles a ballistae behind her and shoots her with it.   Game # 178  of the XP version of FreeCell is a major ass-kicker. I finally solved it, though.   The movie  Powers that Be are not going to show the  Batman Begins  teaser in front of  Spiderman II . Instead, it will be shown in front of  Catwoman , which is supposed to stink like a wet litterbox in a hot garage. What trailer will we see in front of  Spiderman II ?  Catwoman , of course.   Gary Oldman  is doing the voice of Darth Obvious. Or something like that. Bad guy for the third movie. He will always be Sid to me.   I still  can't smell anything. My doctor's appointment is next Wednesday.    I'm still bored . Can't you tell?   Richard "Master Thespian" Burton  ran like a girl. Boy I'm in a snippy mood.

       This week  is going to be far more boring than usual, I can tell.    Jon and  I went to the Sushi Boat yesterday. We were sorry to see they weren't busy at lunch - they have good sushi plus you don't have to wait 45 minutes to eat. Just sit down and start grabbing dishes. They have really good spicy tuna rolls. I hope their business picks up soon.   I was  really happy to learn about the private enterprise mission to outer space. The only way we're ever going to get off this planet is if we find a profitable reason to do so. I am fascintated by NASA but most of our space missions have pretty much been a waste of tax dollars.    We got  TiVo wired to our wireless net at home.   Did I  mention that I was bored?    B  o  r  e  d .    Word o' the day:     risible    SYLLABICATION: ris·i·ble    ADJECTIVE: 1. Relating to laughter or used in eliciting laughter.  2. Eliciting laughter; ludicrous.  3. Capable of laughing or inclined to laugh.   ETYMOLOGY: Late Latin rsibilis, from Latin rsus, past participle of rdre, to laugh.

       This weekend  was the fourth weekend in a row where I had to teach a ground school. I  hate  talking that much! Anyways, I had four students, all young guys. One was a young military man - a lot of fun to look at. One was a german fella. He was a very nice guy and had a good grasp of english; he resembled the actor (Karl-Otto Alberty) who played all those Nazis in the 60's and 70's war movies which was slightly disconcerting. The other two were friends. They looked like typical tennessee young adults but one of them looked amazingly like Orlando Bloom. Bet he doesn't have much trouble getting chicks.  Speaking of uncanny resemblences, Steve came over too me at some point Saturday afternoon, pointed at a woman (tandem student), and said, "Look! It's Denise Richards!" and I  immediately  looked at her hooters(!). Embarrasing. Yeah, they were big. I didn't realize it was so cold out, either. She did resemble the actress in question in the face, too.   So I had four ground school students and ended up doing 5 AFF jumps all total. On top of that I did a bunch of parachute packing and ended up clearing about $400. Not bad for a weekend's work.   I am  somewhat distressed because I have lost almost all of my sense of smell. I was taking Nasonex, a prescription for chronic rhinitis (constant stuffy nose) which I think is the culprit so I quit using it. The trouble is, my allergies come back with a vengeance after the medication completely wears off. Right now my ability to smell comes and goes randomly. I had a good day Sunday, although I'm not sure I should refer to it as "good". I caught a good whiff of someone's particularly nasty flatulence as well as someone's well-defined foot odor. When I got home and decided to deliberately cook something that would require me to saute onions and garlic in olive oil, my sense of smell had deserted me again. Damn. As anyone who has ever had a cold will know, a large component of the ability to taste is the ability to smell. Unless I put in enough cayenne pepper to shrivel an elephant I can't taste anything. I will be visiting my allergy doc soon for some tests. In the meantime I will stock up on Claratin.

       Hey, I  got a raise! And a promotion!  I'm now a  Senior  software analyst. Oh, goodie, more responsibility. Actually I don't mind. Sometimes I'm bored out of my skull.   So anyways:  my husband and I finally remembered that TiVo is updated by telephone. We got rid of our land line. So now we're going to replace our networking hub with a wireless broadband router and connect the TiVo up to that. Transport that last sentence to 1977 and see how long it would have taken you to explain it to a denizen of that era. We are living in a science fiction future, except without all the kewl space travel. That's a shame; really.    I had  a horrible, vivid nightmare last night featuring flesh-eating zombies. This nightmare had a supporting cast of character actors I recognized, and a soundtrack. I remember the music was more disgusting than the zombies. I remember a really chewed-up corpse tried to attack me while I was sitting on the john so I ripped its arm off and beat it over the head while I was screaming for help.  If anybody out there does dream interpretations let me tell you now: I do   NOT   want to know what that dream meant.

       Oh joy!  *Poing* *poing* *poing*  I was at Wal-Mart last night after work and was perusing their $10 DVDs. I found  urlLink Rustler's Raphsody , my all-time favorite movie that nobody saw.  When I was growing up in Puerto Rico, one of the english-language TV stations would show old Roy Rogers movies. I must have seen them all dozens of times. Now old Roy couldn't act his way out of a wet paper sack, but he was handsome, honest, decent, and could shoot the gun out of a man's hand at 50 paces. And boy did he have a nifty wardrobe!  I'm telling you that to explain to you why I have such unconditional love for this movie. It is a gentle satire of the old Gene Autry/Roy Rogers movies. And I do mean gentle. After so many  Airplane! s,  American Pie s, and  Scary Movie s, it's a shock to see something not go for the penis/fart/masturbation jokes. Well, there is some cursing. Damn, damn, hell, damn, tee-tee, doo-doo,...   It features Rex O'Herlihan (Tom Berenger), the singing cowboy. He travels from town to town on his horse Wildfire righting wrongs and bringing justice to the frontier. He has developed almost a zen-like attitude about what he's going to encounter when he gets to a new town; he knows without being told about the pretty but somehow asexual schoolmarm that just moved in, as well as the railroad that's being built and how the cattle baron (Andy Griffith!) is oppressing the peaceful sheepherders. He knows the town drunk ('that guy' G.W. Bailey) is going to become his sidekick before even meeting him.  This movie isn't for everyone but I adore it. And like I've said before, it's kind of mind-blowing to see Tom Berenger play such a good good-guy. Not only did he play Sargeant Barnes in  Platoon , but he played a homosexual rapist/murderer in  Looking for Mister Goodbar  (which sucks, I say. Sucks!). Where did your career go, Tom? BTW he was in the hilariously bad  Cutaway , which was a movie about skydiving drug smugglers. Berenger did learn how to skydive for the movie. The people who made this piece of poop made the mistake of trying to please both skydivers and the unknowing public and ended up pissing off the former and boring the latter.    Anyhow , check out  urlLink  Nancy's  recent amusing comments about the Micheal Stipe stalker she met in Athens once. Obsessions are interesting things, but it's kind of scary to see/meet someone who is full in the grip of one. I can see how it could get remarkably boring having to listen to these one-note defective creatures drone on and on about their undying love. Yeah, I've done my own mental stalking, but never actually sought out the object of my desire. Going to see Ralph Fiennes play Hamlet in London does *not* count! It was my sister's idea, and it's not like we hung around back stage to get a glimpse or anything!  Though if I could get a way-back machine, I'd go back to talk with that red-headed Laertes....  Um! Anyway, here's my link of the week: urlLink Boyfriend of the Week . This woman's tastes are all over the map, which is of course, just fine in my book. Not only was Damian Lewis one of her boyfriends, she has an entry for just about all of my listees. Plus, she has two on Owen Wilson, which someone out there might be interested in reading.

       This weekend  was a repeat of last weekend. Hell, I even landed in the same field as the weekend before when an AFF student decided he was going to pull lower than normal.  I did have 2 students in ground school; a daughter and her father. It was her 18th birthday. He did good; she did great. She had a bunch of relatives call her and try and talk her out of it. Glad she didn't take their advice. She was scared, but once she got out the door she had a blast.  Sunday was rainy, so I read at home. I plowed through  The Rise of Endymion , the last book in the  Hyperion  saga. Good stuff. If I have one complaint it is that Simmons spends too much damn time writing about scenery. After a while I start blah blahing through it to get through to the action. And the last book has a lot of speeches to explain everything that has been going on. But still I have about 50 pages to go and I hope I can finish it during lunch.   When I   emailed around for information on how to take over the world, Hitler, Stalin, Blofeld, and Senator Palpatine all replied with this link:   urlLink Here .  It have given me a lot of super ideas. The one that drives me nuts is what am I going to do with the world once I have taken over and am the Supreme High Chancellor God of Everything I Survey?   Top 10 things I would do if I ran the world    10: Fire all the government workers.  Hire only male models with I.Q.'s below 90. I'm not prejudiced; I don't care if they're gay or not. I just want them to be pretty and stupid. They'll be just as ineffective, but at least the scenery will improve.   9: My standing  bodyguard would be all male models with I.Q.'s above 90. All 3 of them.   8: Full frontal male nudity will be allowed on network television.  Oh, all right, female as well. What the hell, full blown hardcore pr0n! w00t!   7: Move the Capitol of the world to St. John in the Virgin Islands  and make it my pleasure dome/lair/hideout. Feed the occasional secret agent who tries to stop my nefarious plans to the barracudas, stray chickens, and feral donkeys. Everyone in the Virgin Islands will be moved to Florida. Everyone in Florida will be moved to Wisconsin; everyone in Wisconsin will be moved to San Fransisco, and everyone in San Fransisco will be moved to Israel. All Israelis will be moved to Utah, where they will just have to get along with the Mormons because I can't think of anywhere I want to put them.   6: Serve beer in high school  not that you would be required to attend. I bet attendance would improve somewhat, though.   5: Eliminate Region Coding  on DVDs. Tell Europe to rewire to 120 V and switch to NTSC or else. And drive on the RIGHT! Oh, ok in deference to fairness, all Americans must forevermore refer to cookies as 'biscuits' and elevators as 'lifts'.    4: Issue a standing order that anybody who directs a movie with 'shaky cam' scenes in it will be shot on sight.  Yeah, I'm looking at you, Michael Bay.   3: All taxes will be eliminated  but you must pay tribute to the Holy Temples I'll have built everywhere. Pay what you think is appropriate; six-packs accepted. Unless it's in cans. That will get you burned at the stake. Incidentally, the temples will not be built to me, they will be built to Charlton Heston. Because he's one of *my* personal gods, that's why. His statues will have him in full Moses mode, in deference to my western religious upbringing. Just be grateful I'm not having you bow down to Bill Paxton.   2: All Reality Shows will be banned.  I'm halfway tempted to ban all shows about cops, lawyers, and doctors, but I do realize I can't make the world perfect. I will declare a moratorium on amnesia and evil twin plots, though. Joss Whedon, since he's the only one in recent memory who managed to write GOOD evil twin/amnesia teleplays, will be my secretary of state.   1: Establish a Her Royal Highness Shakespeare Company . I know you're thinking my reason for this is peurile, but it's really my plan to prevent any good British actors from being cast as James Bond. Now that I think of it, there is all ready a plot to keep that from happening.

       Ah, I'm  still bored. After politics I need some unadulterated horse poop to soothe myself back into my normal lull.   I watched  part of the MTV movie awards last night. I decided to TiVo it at a later hour so I could skip through the boring stuff. One thing I did catch was an appearance and song by  The Beastie Boys . My first thought was, "geez, they look kinda old!". Has it been that long since they declared that we had to fight for our right to par-tay?   Well, I ran across this site today: urlLink Retro Crush . It has a link to the aforementioned song. Or at least part of it. Damn them, now I have that stupid  Madness  song stuck in my head.

       Whoa, must  be really bored today, because I'm going to talk about politics. Bolt now, if you are so inclined.  I have decided it's not liberals who bother me, nor conservatives. It's the hate mongers on both sides. I have arrived at the conclusion that all hate is the same,  why  you hate is a matter of semantics. This motto sums up the politics of hate:  "Shut up, or I'll kill you!"   It's easy to demonize people. If they are monsters, they are safe to hate. That's why  Nazi  is thrown around in newsgroups with such royal abandon; Hitler being the apotheosis of demonic humans. The trouble is most humans, and I mean the vast majority of us, are not demons and we have reasons for believing and thinking what we do; even if those reasons are based on ignorance and/or faulty logic.  Actually in regard to Hitler this word was a funny choice:    apotheosis    SYLLABICATION: a·poth·e·o·sis  NOUN: Inflected forms: pl. a·poth·e·o·ses (-sz) 1. Exaltation to divine rank or stature; deification.  2. Elevation to a preeminent or transcendent position; glorification: “Many observers have tried to attribute Warhol's current apotheosis to the subversive power of artistic vision” (Michiko Kakutani, New York Times Magazine November 17, 1996). 3. An exalted or glorified example: Their leader was the apotheosis of courage.   ETYMOLOGY: Late Latin apothesis, from Greek, from apotheoun, to deify : apo-, change; see apo– + theos, god;     But fitting, I say.   Excuse me, but I'm going to go blast some flesh-eating zombies, now.

      Here's 2, count them, 2 top 10 lists for you because I'm bored:  The links, by the way, go to their  urlLink IMDb filmographies  just so you can peruse them and go "Oh yeah, it's *that* guy!".   Top 10 Actors I enjoy seeing in the cast list of a movie:   Most of these are 'character' actors. Jeez, that is such a denigrating term. Anyway, they are always fun to watch:   10   urlLink J.T. Walsh  R.I.P., J.T. I always got a kick out of his performances. He always seemed to play bad guys and he never got  too  hammy. Just hammy enough. If you go through his filmography you will be stunned by how many of his movies you have seen.   9   urlLink Adam Baldwin  Not one of the Baldwin brothers. Remember  My Bodyguard ? How about  Full Metal Jacket ? He had small reoccuring roles on both  The X-Files  and  Angel . Good looking; he tends to play tough guys/heavies. Brings a good amount of intensity to his roles, like Clancy Brown only not as creepy (see the other list).   8   urlLink Philip Seymour Hoffman  Often confused with Jack Black, except he's not a patented asshole. I first saw him in  Twister ; he seems to be a favorite of Paul Thomas Anderson ( Boogie Nights  and  Magnolia ).   7   urlLink Brian Cox  Gained my attention as the first Hannibal Lector (in  Manhunter ). He was elegant and menacing in a psycho way without the ham. I saw him last as Melaneus in  Troy .    6   urlLink Chris Cooper  He first came to my attention in  American Beauty , he won me over in  Lone Star  because the love story in that movie involved a middle-aged couple.    5   urlLink Scott Glenn  He plays tough guys. Kind of a poor man's Lee Marvin. Again, plenty of intensity without the ham (mostly). I first noticed him in  The Right Stuff  I think. It might have been something sooner than that. Often confused with Fred Ward, who is often confused with Robert Forster.   4   urlLink Ewan Bremner  Scot. Shows up in movies with Ewan MacGregor a lot. He's not handsome, but he is nowhere near as phugly as his IMDb picture makes him. Holy crap, dude! Who did you piss off to get that picture posted? Or were you cast to play Tim Burton in a movie?!!? Anyway, first noticed in  Trainspotting .   3   urlLink Lance Henriksen  Everybody knows who Lance Henriksen is. I have seen him in a gazillion things; first came to my attention as Bishop in  Aliens .   2   urlLink Tom Sizemore  I hate the fact that he seems to want to self-destruct. Dude. Quit threatening your ex-girlfriends! I can't remember which movie I first saw him in but he's been all over the map. Tends to play heavies or wisecracking soldiers.   1   urlLink William Fichtner  Intensity without getting hammy. See a common thread here? First came to my attention in  Equilibrium  although I have seen him in dozens of other movies before.    Top 10 movie creeps:   At one point in their career, these guys have played some sort of creep and it got them typecast. At least, when they're in the cast list, I get uneasy. Totally unfair, because some if not all of these guys do an exemplary job in whatever they do.    10   urlLink Xander Berkely  Played George Mason in  24 . I have always considered him a creep or a jerk. Can't recall which movie did it, though.   9   urlLink Tom Berenger  It is so totally unfair that I put him on this list. But I saw  Looking for Mister Goodbar . Matter of fact, I double-dog dare you to rent it and watch it back-to-back with  Rustler's Rhapsody . Your brain *will* implode.   8   urlLink Liev Schreiber  He played such a wierdo in  Phantoms  I have never been able to watch him in anything else without getting creeped out. That movie is a guilty pleasure, by the way.   7   urlLink Dylan Baker  I've mentioned him before. He was in  Happiness . I can't watch him in anything else without remembering the scene --- eewww, never mind.    6   urlLink William H. Macy  He plays ordinairy joes so well, but I have  Fargo  stuck in my head. Oh, you betcha.    5   urlLink Michael Wincott  Plays heavies a lot; has a low raspy voice. So why is Michael Wincott on this list and Lance Henriksen on the other list? Henriksen is  intense . Michael Wincott is  creepy .   4   urlLink Ted Levine  Buffalo Bill in  Silence of the Lambs . Need I say more?   3   urlLink Clancy Brown  The Kurgan in  Highlander . Oh, this is funny! He has an active career as cartoon voices including  Spongebob Squarepants .    2   urlLink Steve Buscemi  Everything he's ever done! Now that I think of it, Peter Stormare should be on this list, too. Between him, Buschemi, and William H. Macy, was there ever a wierder collection of creeps?   1  urlLink Vincent D'Onofrio  Private Pyle in  Full Metal Jacket . I remember seeing  Adventures in Babysitting  where he wasn't so fat or brain-damaged and still being somewhat creeped out. He never fails to make me uncomfortable.

       Ha!  Alan sent me a URL that is quite amusing: urlLink  Just go here . Kind of tasteless, but anything having to do with zombies is going to be (kewl!). Includes this little FAQ:    Is Zombie Reagan really that much of an advantage? Doesn't John Kerry have the zombie vote locked up?  No. John Kerry, in fact, isn't really a zombie. He is more akin to Frankenstein's Monster, built out of parts stolen from graveyards under cover of night. He simply claims to be a zombie for  urlLink political advantage.    I spent a lot of time yesterday going through a lot of the links on Lachelle's site (not linked to out of her preference); she went to the Libertarian National Convention this year. She made a comment about how white the party is; I think it's simply because too many people simply don't know about our party. I don't think he would call himself Libertarian, but IMHO he's doggone close:  urlLink Thomas Sowell , even when I'm disagreeing with him, writes simply, clearly, and never fails to explain why he thinks what he thinks. His essays on 'cosmic justice' pretty much hit the nail on the head to explain why I am no longer a Liberal.   Absolutely nothing  remotely interesting happened to me yesterday when I got home. I did finish  Endymion . The sequel is on its way from  urlLink Amazon , along with another Dan Simmons' book and Season 1 of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer . I love gift certificates for birthday presents.

       Jon has  a few things he has to do before he gets his commercial pilot's license. He's kind of peeved about that. But while he was in town (Madison), he and I went to the  Sushi Boat  restaraunt. Pretty nifty; you sit at this bar where these little wooden boats circle around with different plates of sushi and other Japanese foodstuffs. You grab what you want and when you are done the waitress totals your bill by how many little plates are in front of you. I can pack away some sushi; at $1.50 a plate Jon and I racked up a considerable bill.  There was this one dish that kept circling around and around; it looked like barbequed baby octopus. I dared Jon to try it; told him if he ate one, I'd eat the other but he wasn't feeling too adventurous. That's what's neat about Japanese food - it looks so tasty and disgusting at the same time.   We finished  season 2 of  24  last night. I really liked the first half of the season but the second half kind of lost steam. At least Mrs. Palmer showed up again. Things are always interesting when she's poking around, stirring up trouble. I guess Tony and Michelle are an item now since they had a little smooching session a while back. And Chapelle - could they have cast a more toady looking actor for that part? He just begs to be kicked in the nuts.  But now what am I going to watch? Season 3 just finished up. No word on when it's due on DVD. I've been meaning to watch  Stargate SG-1  but I know Jon won't go for a science fiction show. Bugger.   A word  of explanation about the photos below. I remember an old episode of  urlLink Mystery Science Theater 3000  where Joel and the 'bots were discussing the lame props in a cheapo fantasy movie. Joel mentioned how if you gave things cool names, they didn't seem so lame. Like the Shimmering Shield of Surrender, Flaming Wand of Fiery Death and shit like that.  Look, if you have never watched an episode of  MST3K  you are culturally deprived. I hear Netflix has a few on DVD...

       Jon is  in the process of taking the test for his commercial pilot's license. If he gets it, that means he can legally ferry passengers for money. Needless to say, mister stressboy has had all his needles pegged in the red for the last week or so.    We did  watch 2 eps of  24  last night; you know, nekkid Keifer might normally be interesting, but not when someone is applying ) scalpels, b) soldering irons, c) and tasers to said nekkid flesh. Those scenes were *not* pleasant to watch. And those White House bastards locked Ensign Ro in a supply closet! Heads will roll when Jack proves to be right once again.   urlLink Endymion  is quite good. I recommend the whole series; just don't ask me to explain what it's about. I  hate  it when someone asks me what a book is about when I'm reading sometimes. I couldn't sum up these books in less than a thousand pages.  It has been a while since I have read anything Dan Simmons has written; he caught my attention with a short story whose title I have forgotten ( Dying in Bangkok ? Behold, the power of the Web:  urlLink his site  confirms it).  It was about a soldier during Vietnam on leave and a vampire-ish monster who, because of her method of sucking blood, had victims literally lined up around the block. I remember it managed to be quite clinical and erotic at the same time. Anyway, I read  Carrion Comfort  and  Song of Kali  soon after that.  Song of Kali  is set to become a movie as is  Hyperion . I doubt either will happen.   Nancy's husband , Mark, sent me this great link: urlLink The bad review revue . Ha, nothing rouses and inspires the poet in a critic more than a crappy movie!  P.S. I'm glad you're okay, Nancy. Sorry about your Saturn. I'm very happy with mine and glad I didn't buy that SUV I was looking at 5 years ago.  Here's another link:  urlLink The Ruthless Guide to 80's Action . This page has reviews of 80's action movies. They spend a lot of time going over the homoerotic subtexts of a lot of these movies (scroll down to the photos of Jean-Claude Van Damme, Chuck Norris, and Dolph Lundgren for a great laugh). They love  Commando  as much as I do. I haven't fully explored this site, so Caveat Emptor.  So besides two links o' the day, I also bring you a word o' the day:    prevaricate    SYLLABICATION: pre·var·i·cate  INTRANSITIVE VERB: Inflected forms: pre·var·i·cat·ed, pre·var·i·cat·ing, pre·var·i·cates To stray from or evade the truth; equivocate.   ETYMOLOGY: Latin praevricr, praevrict- : prae-, pre- + vricre, to straddle (from vricus, straddling, from vrus, bent).    I was reading an interview with my favorite redhead and he used this word. Mmmmmm, I just love it when a man talks wordy!

       Slow news  day. I had another ground school Saturday, and then 2 skydives, a level 1 and level 7 AFF. That was it. Uneventful weekend. Spent most of my time sleeping, or reading  Endymion  which is as captivating as the  Hyperion  books.  Well, I did spend Saturday night at the Cullman County E.R. with a skydiver who had a hard opening. No real damage; he's just a hurting puppy for now. I hate that part of my job.   I was  outed in the Damian Lewis mailing list I'm a member of; someone apparently did some web-surfing and found my site. A few disgruntled comments about my use of the term 'slamhound', but no real flame-fest. I hope it's understood that sometimes I use a snarky tone when talking about things. I blame all the time I've spent at  urlLink TWoP .   Jon and  I have been freed from the tryanny that is  Bell South . Hooray! We are cancelling our land line and getting rid of our DSL line. Cable modem and cell phones make them redundant. We have never been happy with their service, anyway.   Later on  when I get home tonight I'll have some more boring pictures to post; they are not of our cats.

       I'd like  to welcome a new reader; well, somewhat new because I don't know when he started reading it. Can't get mad at him for not telling me because I didn't tell him I had started writing it. Hi honey! >>Smooch!   More 24  last night but only 2 episodes because Jon got back from work late. He had a large group of tandems yesterday so naturally it rained and was cloudy most of the day. He banged up his leg on landing and was limping pretty bad when he got home. He also suffered an allergic reaction to a couple of ant bites on that same limb. His foot was all swole up. Not his day.   The 60th  anniversary of D-Day is this sunday. The Hitler channel will be showing plenty of documentaries. I'm particularly interested in any  interviews with the 101st Airborne; kind of got caught up in their stories because of  Band of Brothers . I'm especially fascinated by Richard Winters because by all accounts Damian Lewis's portrayal was dead-on and Winters is really that honorable a man.   Apparently his mother had been a Mennonite (he's from Hershey County, Pennsylvania) and he had a strong religious upbringing. Despite this he only seemed intolerant of incompetence. His best friend, Captain Nixon, was a raging drunk and he never judged him. Matter of fact, in one of the most un-pc things I have ever seen on a t.v. show, Winters gave Nixon the first shot at raiding a humongous wine/booze cellar that they captured from the Nazis. By all accounts he was a just leader who wouldn't needlessly put his men in harm's way. He took "follow me" to serious extremes.   I saw  parts of  urlLink Point Break  last night, which is a hysterically macho movie. the director, Katheryn Bigelow, has as bad a raging case of man-love as I do; it really shows in this movie. Anyway, FBI agent Johnny Utah (*SNERK!*) goes undercover in a group of California surfers, let by Bodhi (Patrick Swayze), because he thinks they might be bank robbers. Surfing, drinking, chases, and skydiving, ensue.  I won't rag too hard on the skydiving scenes - they were ridiculous; but the photography was beautiful and I think they did a great job of capturing the beauty and excitement of a skydive. This movie is one of my favorite mindless entertainment movies. Plus Keanu is such a joy to look at.

       Well, after  my near-brush with discussing political issues in my last installment, I shall steer clear and discuss utter bullshit today.   First off , 3 more hours of  24 . Yeah, I did notice the Wolfram and Hart toady from  Angel , Daniel Dae Kim. Any relation to Daniel Day Lewis? And alas, poor Xander (I never knew that someone actually had that name). It's better to burn up than to melt away, I guess.   And just because I mentioned verisimilitude and gently spanked  24  about some of its computer shenanigans, I shall now gently spank it for its skydiving sequence. What was with the belly mounted reserve? He was using a sport rig - hence the 3 ring release system on his risers. And why were they not connected to anything  until  he left the plane? And what was with the goggles over the helmet? And the flare on the end of his foot - kinda makes it hard to see the ground, don't you think?  I'm just being mean. I did notice he jumped from a Cessna Caravan, which is a perfectly good airplane to jump from. I've done it myself, but not under those circumstances. Very enjoyable episodes, but with 9 hours left, I have to wonder what they will now concentrate on. Presumably who is trying to undermine the Presidency.  And in further news:  urlLink IMDb 's news and gossip pages, an ever reliable resource (pretend this is a sarcastic smiley), is reporting that that huge prick Michael Bay insists Kate Beckinsale was hired for her part in  Pearl Harbor  because she  isn't  that good looking. Jesus, if she's ugly, then I'm a troglodyte.  I fully admit that  Armageddon  is a guilty pleasure; so it  Pearl Harbor  (Ben Affleck  and  Josh Hartnett. I'm so ashamed). Michael Bay has an ego that would make Frank Sinatra look humble. If you ever get a chance, the Criterion (!!!) edition of the  Armageddon  DVD has 2 commentary tracks. One has some of the actors, including Ben Affleck. His comments are hilarious. He points things out like gratuitous helicopters in scenes that helped overinflate the movie's budget, and he does a wicked impersonation of Billy Bob Thornton. The other track includes Micheal Bay, who convinced himself he was creating  ART . He is a pompous, perambulating penis.

       Nothing happened  yesterday. I got home, let the frog out of the pool, made dinner, then finished beating up on the Greeks in  Civilization . I joined Jon on the couch where we watched a few episodes of  Cops  then went to bed. The end.   I am  going on yet another diet. This one is due to health reasons. My acid reflux is getting worse despite the Prilosec treatment so I just have to face facts and I have to*sob* quit drinking beer for a while. Maybe a long while. I also need to quit eating so damn much. I'm not going to watch the scale, because my goal here isn't to lose weight, it's to get control of my eating habits.  I'm going to go low carb in the sense of I'm going to knock the usual suspects out of my diet again - sugar, bread, pasta, rice, potatoes, etc. and begin eating more vegetables. Protein is never a problem.  The tough thing is the beer. I don't consider myself an alcoholic, but I have gotten into the habit of drinking beer 5 or 6 nights a week. I had four beers last night; I woke up with heartburn. Damn, that hurts too much. So, we'll see how long I stay on the wagon. I'm sure I'll be bugging you about it for a while now. Weekends are the worst; everyone drinks and there's always beer in the beer fridge at the drop zone.   A group  of Christians are taking a page from the  urlLink Free State Project  and are trying to organize a movement to move to South Carolina with the eventual goal being to secede from the Union. Good for them, I say. Look: it's wrong to try to impose your will on other people. So it has to be frustrating for like-minded people to live in a place where they are forced to live by someone else's rules. Naturally this cuts both ways. The non-Christians who live in South Carolina may become a minority and will be forced to deal with blue laws and dry counties. Like I do; the price I pay for living in Alabama.  So what am I saying? Am I saying that I advocate the Balkanization of the U.S: libertarians move to New Hampshire, Christians move to South Carolina, Texans all move back to Texas (you know they're dying to become an independent republic again)? Why, yes I am. Liberals could complete their takeover of California.   Would it be so bad for the United States to become a loose federation, like the founders intended? Look at it this way: Wyoming or Idaho or Indiana would not be able to invade Iraq as easily as our mega-nation did. Small means less powerful. That's a  good  thing.  What about the minorities? The communist that has lived all his life in New Hampshire, the Muslims that live in South Carolina, the Chicagoans that moved to Texas? Either move, or deal with the laws and the customs of the State you live in.  Just like I do, now.   And by  the way: the last time South Carolina tried to secede, it didn't work too well. Just a reminder.

       A rather  uneventful Memorial Day weekend - it was marred by weather. I taught a ground school saturday morning - one student.   She did okay on the jump. Most people tend to overload on their first AFF jump anyway. She passed. The only other jump I did all weekend was a coach jump with another Sandy.   I played  a protracted game of  Civilization III  most of Sunday and Monday at home. I did go back to the DZ Sunday night; went to bed at 10pm and was awakened for a tornado warning. Ah, Springtime in Alabama! The Air Evac people came and knocked on our trailer (Jon and I bought a camper and we stay there during the weekends) to warn us. We put our airplane indoors and waited out the storm. It was somewhat disappointing - no hail, no horrendous gusts of wind, no tornado, just lots of thunder, lightning, and rain, rain, rain.  So I went home Monday morning and let the obligatory frog out of the pool skimmer and played on the computer. I eventually stopped, and started reading  Endymion , by Dan Simmons. Good far future science fiction - it's the sequel to  Hyperion  and  the Fall of Hyperion . I'm kind of annoyed it's written in first person. I don't like first person novels.   Monday night  Jon brought a stray skydiver home. The three of us ate Chinese food and watched  urlLink Black Hawk Down , about the Somalian operation that went to hell in 1992.  I'm very fond of this movie because it has 3 - count 'em, 3 listees: Jason Isaacs, Ewan MacGregor, and Eric Bana. It also has one of my guilty pleasures: Josh Hartnett. Sorry, I think he's adorable. He's in the same group as Damon and Affleck, and Keanu Reeves.   The rest of the cast isn't too bad, either: Ron "hottie from E.R." Eldard, Tom "Sorry, Heidi" Sizemore, Orlando "Legolas" Bloom, Jeremy "Don't be that guy" Piven, Sam Shephard (for such an earnest looking fella, he writes some outrageous plays), Ioan "It's pronounced YOO-an Griffith!" Gruffudd, and Ewan "I have a better American accent than that other Ewan" Bremner. Oh, can't forget William Fichtner, who is rapidly becoming one of my favorite character actors. He's not that good looking (although I was deeply impressed with his nekkid bod in the highly recommended  Go ) - he's more ordinary than anything, but he's a damn good actor.  Oh, the movie? Erm, these Rangers and Delta Force soldiers try to kidnap some Somalis and find themselves in serious doo-doo when the entire town of Mogadishu tries to kill them. This movie is a keen illustration of the difference between highly trained soldiers and undisciplined mobs (over 1,000 somalis were killed compared to the 19 soldiers). It also is a keen illustration of why the good intentions of busybodies are never going to be appreciated. A very relevant movie to watch considering what is happening over in Iraq.   So!  Umm, how was your weekend?

       Day 5 PSMF:  Hooray! 138.2 lbs (Temp:97.0). Now that's more like it! See what I mean by stairstep?   So basically I have lost 1.6 pounds since last Friday. If I can stick to this damn plan through the weekend, my Monday results should be   interesting.  I described this before but now I'm going to go into even more obsessive detail: the actual food.  This list is exactly why it isn't for the faint of heart. I have found it easy so far, becaue I'm viewing the food aspect as fuel, not a gastronomic event.  Breakfast: 1/2 cup fat free cottage cheese OR 3 egg whites (hard boiled) with 1 slice fat free cheese. Veggie: 2.5 cups Romaine Lettuce  Lunch: 2 Cans (10 oz) Starkist Chunk Light Tuna w/ 3 tablespoons Pace Picante Sauce and 3 large stalks of Celery  Dinner: Grilled (George Foreman grills are indespensable) Chicken breast w/ 2 cups of broccoli.  That's IT. It's the same damn thing day in day out!  I'm also helped by the fact that I'm only doing this for 2 weeks at the start. And I think I can make it through these first 2 weeks. I have no hunger (so far). I think that's a combination of the Ephedrine and the food I'm eating. I passed an interesting test today. I went into a convenience store that also sells breakfast and lunch to buy some coffee. Despite all the good smells, I had no problem ignoring them. Yes, nose is working fine today.  I think I said this before too: My goal for this diet is to get where I'm going and stay there. I've become resigned to being vigilant for the rest of my life regarding every morsel I put in my mouth. This means constant, anal recording of food (  urlLink Fitday  is a handy, free way to do it).  So what am I going to do after these 2 weeks, when I have to go to the World Freefall Convention for 5 days? It will be a test for maintaining. I have a feeling the best way to do that is to keep my breakfasts and lunches simple and light, and when I go buy dinner, make good decisions. I'm not talking grazing at the salad bar; I'm talking if I buy a hamburger leave off the fries and drink water instead of coke. The beer, I'm afraid, is inevitable. Once you register for the WFFC, the beer is free. Sheesh.  I plan to stay on ephedrine, because I'm just now adjusting to it and I don't want to have to start all over when I get back.  And my plan for after the WFFC? I'll cross that bridge when I get there. But I'm *thinking* about 2 more weeks of PSMF, another week off, then 2 weeks of PSMF, then comes Costa Rica. Which will be another round of temptation fighting.

        Day 4 PSMF:  Dang it! 139.8 again! (Temp:97.5) Oh, well. I did notice something wrong with my calorie count. I had the totals wrong for the tuna I eat (every frickin day). I was eating twice the amount I was recording. It doesn't translate to that many extra cals (175), but it could explain a little of the problem. Or maybe I should just quit worrying about it. Shoot, it's only been three days.  It does mean I can slack off a little and not eat as much during dinner. Which is good; I feel like I'm eating too much at dinner any way. Just for microobsession, I calculated that one gram of tuna protein is costing me $.014 ($.50 a can at Wal-Mart) and one gram of chicken breast protein is costing me $.026 ($15 for a bag of 14 at Sam's Club). Therefore, eat the same amount of tuna and cut down on the chicken.    In other  news I did a level 1 AFF yesterday afternoon. Good student (military guy). He was left over from Sunday; he couldn't jump because some thunderstorms rolled in. It's nice to get a jump in in the middle of the week after sitting on my butt all day at work.

       Day 3 PSMF:  Still no weight change (139.8). Temp is still normal, 97.6 degrees. The big difference is I got some real sleep last night (yay!). The Ephedrine tends to keep my sleep light. I had forgotten that hypocaloric diets do that to me, too. But I was actually tired yesterday. Especially on the drive home from work, which wasn't a good thing.   I noticed that I perked up considerably after I ate later on - the sleepyness could have been caused by an insulin crash.  Maybe I should hold back some of my lunch and eat it later on in the day.  Despite no movement on the scale, my clothes feel a bit looser. I'm still blaming my period on the lack of scale movement.    Hey!  I may be getting a job (no pay) as a DVD reviewer for this smaller-scale web site (which I will link to if they decide to publish my stuff). The owner of said site is a pretty cool fellow (we got into this amusing argument on his message boards about Ewoks).  The main thing he is looking for, besides the ability to critique and write, is someone who will meet deadlines. So my first deadline is midnight Friday. I'm going to Wal-Mart this afternoon to find me a more recent movie to dissect.

       Day 2: PSMF  I stuck to the food aspect no problem yesterday. Matter of fact, with the removal of (most) fat, I had a boatload of food for dinner last night. I had zero urge to snack because it took me so long to eat. That ain't a bad thing. We shall see if it continues.  My grand total calorie consumption yesterday was 698 calories. I stepped on the scale and still weigh 139.8.  I won't be losing any water from glycogen depletion because my glycogen stores were depleted last week. I got that great (ok, not so great) no glycogen burn in my muscles at the gym this morning. I did have plenty of energy, though. Temp was 97.3, which is about normal for me. It was higher last week because I was pre-menstrual (another reason the scale ain't moving yet).  Theoretically speaking, I should be losing a pound every 3-4 days. Therefore the scale should show a .2 loss every day, just about. I'm not worried about it because as all professional dieters know, weight loss isn't linear. It's stairstep, for some reason that hasn't been adequately explained yet.    What else  did I do yesterday besides obsess over my diet? Not much; Jon bought stuff to upgrade his computer so he was pretty much absorbed in that. It gave me a chance to play Civilization III uninterrupted for a while. Pesky Indians! Ghandi's band, not Montezuma's.

        So. My  weekend was typical: some skydives (6). Some fun, some AFF. Whee!   And now   the new thing I'm trying out. I'm going to put out a big warning: don't try this at home; I'm a professional dieter!  No, really. This is not a good thing to do. It's called a Protein Sparing Modified Fast. I would highly recommend people not to try it especially if they don't weightlift.   A quick definition - PSMFs were developed for obese people. Instead of putting someone on a complete fast, he would be given protein, in an attempt to prevent the body from cannibalizing its own stores of protein (muscles). Bodybuilders and other weight trainers have adopted this diet for cutting phases because (like me) spending months on a diet was slowly driving them crazy.  Here's the deal: a PSMF diet consists of 1 to 1.5 grams of protein per pound of lean body mass a day. This ratio means I need about 130 -160 grams of protein a day. This amount translates to about 520 - 640 calories a day. I won't be just eating pure protein. With each meal I'll be eating about 1 -2 cups of vegetables - the leafy or green ones; the ones big on fiber and low on calories like Romaine, Broccoli, cabbage, bell peppers, etc. Not only will they supply some badly needed vitamins and minerals, they will help keep things moving along quite nicely.  Wait, but that's not all! 6 grams of fish oil a day are necessary - fat is kept to a minimum on this diet so essential fatty acids will come from fish oil caplets. Sam's club has a big bottle of 300 caplets for 7 bucks.  That's still not all! I'm taking a multivitamin, and calcium and magnesium supplements. I'm also substituting half of the salt I use with potassium (Morton's No-Salt).   And that's still not all! Ephedrine-Caffeine stacks for energy, metabolism boosts, and appetite suppression. And for me, a little boost in the lung capacity (Ephedrine is used in the treatment of athsma). I'm taking 12 mg of Ephedrine 3 times a day and drinking all the coffee I want. I bet you thought they banned Ephedrine. Nope! Just Ephedra, the naturally occuring form of Ephedrine. Ephedrine is available OTC. For the most parts. It's also used in the manufacturing of illegal substances to it is dissapearing off of drug store shelves. Bastards. The drug stores. I don't care about the idiots blowing themselves up with meth labs.   The proper dosage is 25mg three times a day, but I get quite a boost with what I take as it is. The nice thing about Ephedrine is even as the nervous and sleepless side effects wear off, the metabolism boost doesn't.  So, with about 600 calories a day from protein, plus about 100 other calories from fish oil, veggies, and the occasional random carb or fat gram from the foods I eat, I will be eating about 700 calories a day, giving me roughly 1000 calories a day defecit. (Maintenence calories for me are about 1700 a day).  Drawbacks? Two major ones. The first one is the huge restriction on the types of foods you can eat. Let's just say I'm looking at a lot of egg whites, tuna, and chicken breasts in my near future. This problem is reason 1 why I won't do this diet for more than two weeks in a row.  Second drawback - It's still a pretty damn low amount of calories. I will be monitoring my metabolism and overall physiological feeling for any drops or nasty mood swings. The metabolism problem is why I don't recommend anybody but weight trainers use this diet, and for these reasons:  Weightlifting will tell your body you need your muscle so don't cannibalize it.  It will let you know (pretty darn fast) if you are losing muscle.  It is more effective in boosting your metabolism than other forms of exercise, like aerobics.    So: today  is day one. I started the day with 4 hardboiled egg whites (w/ a lot of spices) for breakfast. I'm having 2 cans (5 ounces) of Tuna. I mixed in 2 tablespoons of Pace Picante sauce to cut the fish taste and give it some flavor. For both breakfast and lunch I had romaine lettuce as my veggie of choice. No dressing.  Dinner will be 2 chicken breasts - Sam's Club sells these bag of 14 breasts, with the fat completely trimmed off so each one has 1 gram of fat and 41 grams of protein. Veggie of choice will most likely be broccoli.  If all goes well, my food totals for the day will be: 697 calories overall. 11 grams of fat (7 from the fish oil), 18 grams of carbs (10g fiber), and 138 grams of protein.  I weigh: 139.8 lbs and my morning temp was 97.7. (which is about normal for me).  One last post script. That amount of protein will not give me kidney problems. It's only bad if you have kidney problems in the first place. Plus I'm drinking water like mad anyway so I can tell you my kidneys are working just fine, thankyouverymuch.

       I was  dog-tired yesterday. I've always wondered about that saying. Most dogs I know never get tired. Cats, however... So anyways I was cat-tired yesterday and didn't feel like writing. It was a combination of things - I'm back on a ketogenic diet and it can take a few days of tiredness before your brain adjusts to the ketones. I'm also hitting the gym pretty hard, plus I'm using ephedrine, which can cause sleeplessness.  I will bore everyone to tears by logging my diet; I'll try to refrain from manic-obsessive detail but don't count on it. First off I'm keeping my calories around or below 1,000 a day. Second, I'm taking an E/C stack (Ephedrine and Caffeine). Third - weightlifting. Jon and I have slacked a bit at the gym lately and this week was the first week we went all 3 days.  I'm also running again and I found a bizarre side-effect: I can smell again! And boy do I smell. The liquid soap I bought for the shower is just plain disgusting. Wheeew! The tropical coconut moisturizing body lotion I use at work still smells great, so I'm not smelling things wrong (which happened to me once). My car smells like stale ass. I need to attack it with some Febreeze.   Anyways, I  have just gotten started; I have stuck with it a whole 3 days. Well, only 2 if you count the lasagna I had tuesday night. No matter what I do, the real key to this round of self-punishment will be to avoid beer. Which will be impossible when Jon and I go to the World Freefall Convention the first week in August. I'll try to refrain until then.  So: here are my beginning stats (beginning today, not Tuesday): Weight: 141.2 Temp: 98.0  Why temp? It's about the only affordable way to gauge whether or not your metabolism is slowing down. I'll post tape measurements (if I dare to) later on in the proceedings.  Starting Monday, I'm going to try something different diet-wise. I don't want to go into detail yet; I haven't completely made up my mind on it.    In other  non-news: Jon and I watched  urlLink Starsky & Hutch . It was okay. Some funny moments, but mainly it was lame. I like Stiller and Wilson, even if they continually play the same characters, but they didn't match the level of wierdness they reached with  Zoolander . Will Ferrell's bit was the funniest. Did not like Snoop Doggy Dogg as Huggy Bear. Excuse me, that last sentence is making me laugh. Mr. Dogg is just not as cool as Antonio Vargas was. Or so my memory insists. It's always nice to see Fred Williamson get some work.  Plot: what plot? Mismatched buddy cop film. Okay?   The most lame part of this movie was the freaking soundtrack. I had listed here a long time ago my 10 most hated songs. I had mercifully forgotten one evil song that this movie insisted on resurrecting:  Afternoon Delight . Monstrous bastards. It almost makes me long for  Safety Dance .

       Went over  to a friend's house yesterday for dinner: a young jumper (young in jumps, not years) and his wife and very young daughter. I didn't want to go at first. I'm such a loner. I didn't fight though; we went and had a good time (and fantastic lasagna).  Hey, that was the extent of my day yesterday! Oooo exciting, isn't it?   I'm so looking forward to vacation.

      Not much to post today. I am happy to note that I still giggle like an idiot while watching  urlLink Monty Python and the Holy Grail . Silly Kaniggits.  Quick political note - I tend to agree with Helly: pure libertarianism won't work. That's why I pretty much would like to see the Federal Government pay attention to the constitution and return a lot of their powers back to the states. That makes me more of a paleo liberal (or was that a paleo conservative?) than a libertarian. It's much easier for people to migrate from state to state and one person's voice in a state means more than on a Federal level. It's even more powerful at a county or community level.  Speaking of political labels, I was perusing an amusing flame war somewhere and someone accused someone else of being an anarcho-fascist. I laughed so hard it brought tears to my eyes.

      Whoa!  Check out this big bad word:    synecdoche  SYLLABICATION: syn·ec·do·che  NOUN: A figure of speech in which a part is used for the whole (as hand for sailor), the whole for a part (as the law for police officer), the specific for the general (as cutthroat for assassin), the general for the specific (as thief for pickpocket), or the material for the thing made from it (as steel for sword).&nbsp;    ETYMOLOGY: Middle English synodoches, from Medieval Latin synodoche, alteration of Latin synecdoch, from Greek sunekdokh, from sunekdekhesthai, to take on a share of : sun-, syn- + ekdekhesthai, to understand.    OTHER FORMS: synec·dochic (snk-dkk) , synec·dochi·cal (--kl) —ADJECTIVE   I'm going to be busy for  hours  trying to figure out a way I can slip this into a casual conversation.&nbsp; &nbsp;   So anyways , not a big deal weekend-wise. Did one jump had a bad landing. More embarrassing than painful. We had a pool party at our house Saturday night and I slept in on Sunday.   The only thing I watched was  urlLink Ghosts of the Abyss , James Camernon's documentary about the Titanic. It was originally released in 3D in IMAX theaters. I wish I had seen it in the theater.   James Cameron led an expedition to the Titanic in 2001 and filmed a great deal of the wreckage using technology specifically created for the endeavor; namely two Remotely Operated Vehicles he nicknamed "Jake" and "Elwood". These little robots on fiber optic leashes were used to squeeze through windows and tight spaces to film deep into the interior of the shiprwerck. Cameron invited his friend Bill Paxton along. Paxton has acted in 4 of Cameron's movies, including  Titanic . The reason he was asked along seems to be as a stand-in for the audience. He's not a technician, diver, marine biologist, etc. so many scenes with him in it involve the professionals explaining to him about what is going on.   In his first experience aboard the tiny submersibles they take down to the Titanic wreck he is understandably quite nervous. By the later dives he participated in he is helping out like an old hand. He narrates most of the movie, too.   I really liked this documentary. It is a nice complementary piece to his movie and you really get a feel for the layout of the ill-fated ship. I enjoyed the movie  Titanic , but like a lot of people older than 14, I thought the love triangle was pointless. I give Mr. Cameron some points back with this movie.

       Left work  early yesterday to beat the fierce thunderstorms headed our way. Fortunately it never got too bad at home. I always seem to miss the really nasty stuff. Not that I'm complaining.   I did  some channel-surfing yesterday. I got to watch part of  World's most dumbass crooks caught on video and the sanctimonious cops who nabbed them . Depressing. I wanted to watch  I Love the 90's  but for some reason VH1 isn't transmitting any sound. I saw one of the more amusing  South Park  episodes;  Chinpokoman . When the Japanese characters speak Japanese, they speak real Japanese, instead of John Belushi Japanese which is the norm.   I stopped when I saw  urlLink Dazed and Confused  on the  Oxygen  channel, a channel aimed at women. I wonder why they showed this - it's not exactly a woman's movie. Not that it's a man's movie. It's a movie for anyone who spent time as a kid/teenager in the 70's. I remember the first time I saw this I was living at home with my mom so she got to watch it too. She didn't find it nearly as funny as I, but then I suppose she appreciated  American Grafitti  far more than I did.  I'm amused that a movie could make me nostalgic about high school in the 70's: I had a rough time back then, especially the first few years after our family moved back from Puerto Rico. But still: the laxness of purchasing alcohol (18 was the legal drinking age back then), the casual attitude towards pot, the ugly clothes and hairstyles, and the beautiful muscle cars. *Sigh*. Then there's the music. Not a big fan of that era of music, but it does evoke memories.  The best part of the movie to me is Big Hair Ben Affleck. He plays a monumental jerk. It's also the first movie I saw Matthew McConaughey in. It also has Milla Jovovich as a Senior harpy, and she does a good job! I usually thinks she overacts but she's dead-on as a royal high school bitch. Maybe she just needs to stay away from Luc Besson.  One thing I did notice is I have become totally irritated by commercials. I'm not against commercials; they pay the bills for the broadcasters after all. Buy anyway I wandered off for 30 minutes after the first commercial break, rewound TiVo, and managed to fast forward through any commercials after that. Far more satisfying.

       After all  that heavy writing about Bosnia, I guess I should go ahead and talk about the movie for the reasons I bought it. First, here's my word o' the day:    prurient   SYLLABICATION: pru·ri·ent  ADJECTIVE: 1. Inordinately interested in matters of sex; lascivious.  2a. Characterized by an inordinate interest in sex: prurient thoughts.  b. Arousing or appealing to an inordinate interest in sex: prurient literature.   ETYMOLOGY: Latin prrins, prrient-, present participle of prrre, to yearn for, itch.    This word has absolutely nothing to do with what I'm about to write.  So: how does the man I'm mentally stalking fare in this movie? Lewis has improved, acting-wise since  Warriors . His character here is a flawed, but for the most part sympathetic. He does a good thousand-yard stare and he gets to cry a few times. However, he's never allowed to cut loose like he did in  The Forsyte Saga , which is ironic because his character, Soames, is the apotheosis of repressed. I swear sometimes in TFS his face was a darker shade of red than his hair and he looked like he was going to explode literally. Even in  Band of Brothers  I thought he had more chances to show emotion even though Lt. Winters is a distant person. His character's deep care and worry for his men is strongly shown (without being hammy) in BoB and I think those scenes are what got him his Golden Globe nomination.  Physically, he looked great. Especially in the scene where he walked down some stairs butt nekkid to answer the phone. Woo-hoo, male ass! Thank you, BBC, for knowing who your viewers are! He also got to keep the natural color of his hair. In BoB, he had to put a dark rinse in (though he fought hard to be allowed to keep it red) because of the filming methods they used. The colors were muted (see  Saving Private Ryan  for an example of this filming method) and his hair would have stood out garishly, especially in sunlight. He had his natural color in TFS, but he had dentist hair (I wish I could remember the name of the woman who pointed that out).   Of secondary notice was Welsh hottie Ioan Gruffudd. I first noticed him in  Titanic . Really! I remember seeing it and thinking "Whoa. Who's the babe?" even though he has about 5 minutes total screen time (if that). He is best known in the states for the Arts & Entertainment  Horatio Hornblower  series. I've seen most of them. Other than wanting him to get a haircut, he is a  lot  of fun to look at in that series. No nekkid butt shots for him in  Warriors , however. Gruffudd played Bossinney the architect in  The Forsyte Saga  and can currently be seen as Lancelot in  King Arthur , a movie I'm going to wait for on DVD.   Oh. His acting? I thought he underplayed his role until the very last scene. He had me sobbing into my red wine. I wanted to hug him, too.

      I finally finished  urlLink Warriors . I'm not going to avoid spoilers because chances are you will never see this movie. It isn't even available in England any more. I bought a VHS copy on EBay.   Gasp!  Is Sandy advocating piracy? No, not for movies that are widely available. Many movies, however, are impossible to come by unless you buy from an unauthorized source. Sorry, I have no problems with the latter form of piracy. Lesson to companies: your smaller products may have a shot in odd markets. Find a way to market them if you want to stop that sort of piracy. I will have no problem with buying this movie again if I could get it on DVD.   To reiterate, Warriors  is about British troops who are sent to Bosnia in the fall of 1992 as part of a United Nations Peacekeeping force. They are only there to ensure that humanitarian aid gets to the people who need it. We see what happens in Bosnia through the eyes of four soldiers - Private James (Mathew MacFadyen), Sargeant Sochanik (Cal Macaninch), Leftenant Loughrey (Damian Lewis), and Leftenant Feeley (Ioan Gruffudd) (YOO-an Griffith. I love Welsh names).  James is an easygoing bloke (the British version of an ordinary Joe) who loves Soccer (sorry, football) and has a good nature. Sochanik is an older man whose parents were refugees who fled to Scotland. He is best described as stoic (for the most part). Loughrey is about to be married and Feeley is a career soldier who doesn't seem to have any ties to the civilian world.   The movie begins with these four men in England (Liverpool, mostly), each reacting differently to the news of their callup to go to Bosnia. Sochanik is hit hardest, having had to deal recently with his brother's death in a farming accident. Loughrey has a tough time explaining things to his fiance, who is planning their wedding.  Once they get to Bosnia, each of them get subjected to apalling sights and has to watch as bad things happen to people they have come to care about. James sees a refugee wearing a soccer (sorry, FOOTBALL) shirt and tries to get the young man out of a killing zone but only ends up getting the man arrested and himself in trouble. Sochanik is harrassed and verbally abused by some Serbian thugs because of his ancestry. Loughrey and Feeley continually want to evacuate people but their superiors shoot them down for a grotesquely stupid reason:  They can't evacuate anyone unless they are injured because it is feared that this will look like they are participating in 'ethnic cleansing'. In other words, they would be perceived as helping the Serbs drive the Croats and Muslims out of their homes (or vice versa). Feeley intervenes by himself once when he sees a family getting mistreated. He comes by later only to discover that the bad guys came back and killed them all. Both he and Loughrey finally disobey orders and get a group of people away from certain death; their enlisted men support them, and so surprisingly does their commanding officer. Apparently they aren't too happy with their orders, either.  But that action was a spit in the ocean; Loughrey, despite his fiance (who turns out to get pregnant), gets involved with one of their interpreters. This affair upsets Feeley, but he has his own problems when he gets too close to a Muslim woman whose husband has gone off to fight (hey, it's a TV movie). Bad things happen here too, of course. Also, poor good-hearted James gets subjected to a horrific task; he has to search a truckfull of dead bodies because one of them is alive.  The movie ends with everyone back home and how they deal with it (badly). James goes off on a mother and her whining child in a supermarket, coming across as a lunatic. Despite some wonderful support from family and friends, what he was subjected to has damaged him. Sochanik is obviously affected, but coming from a long line of refugees seems to handle it best. Loughrey's implosion is manifested when he lashes out at his girlfriend physically. It is a split-second action which he can't even explain to the police. Feeley, who has been very reserved and acts like nothing has happened, eventually tries to kill himself. Some of his men stop him.  The movie is low-budget, but the producers do the best with what they have. Violence is kept offscreen; some blood is shown but for the most part the atrocities are reflected in the reactions of the soldiers. There's some cussing but only in extreme emotional sequences. I found the acting to be pretty low-key but I suppose that's that British stoicism. I think the understated manner of this film helped get across what these men went through. The quality of acting is what I expect of a BBC production. If I have one complaint I had a hard time with some of the accents. This complaint is why I would buy it on DVD only so I could get the closed captions. I have to watch a lot of British and Australian movies with the closed captioning on.  So much for the technical aspects. This movie had one fascinating theme that you don't often get from war movies: that was the theme of emasculation. These men are soldiers and they are incapable of doing anything useful. I don't mean whipping out an automatic weapon and mowing down the bad guys; I mean using their skills and weaponry as a threat to stop the looting, raping, and murder. Can you imagine being a member of the British army, the descendants of the great Empire builders, and having some pea-brained thug do whatever he wants in front of you because he know he can get away with it? The worst threat they can muster is telling the thugs they will be 'arrested and tried as war criminals'. Ooh, scary. They are so restrained from doing anything that when Sochanik gets in a thug's face and can only hurl insults and threats, he is regarded as a hero by the other men (and is of course put up on charges).  This movie did nothing to change my views of getting involved in other people's problems.

       I haven't  finished  Warriors  yet, but I did do some research on that period. Apparently, after Tito (one of the Jackson 5) died and after the breakup of the Soviet Union (good riddance), Yugoslavia as a nation broke apart. Part of that breakup was the state of Bosnia-Herzocantspellit which has three distinct ethnic groups - the Serbs (Bosnia is right next to Serbia) who are Eastern Orthodox Christian, The Croats (Bosnia is right next to Croatia, as well) who are Catholic, and the Muslims (Slavs whose ancestors converted during the Ottoman Empire).  Slobodan Miloshevich, Serbia's ruler, didn't give much truck to the idea of Bosnian independence, instead preferring they stay attached to Serbia, despite the fact that the Serbs are a minority there. He whipped up a lot of nationalistic attitudes in Bosnia. That, plus a better army and plenty of warped press, incited the bloodbath that was Bosnia in the early 1990s. The United Nations stepped in in 1992 only to keep the populace fed.  What is really sad is these three groups, plus the requisite put-upon Jews and Gypsies, had lived in peaceful coexistence for 500 years (barring the happy time everyone had during WWII). These people aren't tribal types; Yugoslavia was an advanced European nation (despite the commie rule). What brought them to such awful destruction was ignorance, a controlled flow of news, and a petty tyrant.   Deciding to interfere or not when Hell breaks out is tough. When shite hits the fan its always the ordinary men, women, and children who suffer. Those who have any type of power thrive in appalling circumstances. My knee-jerk reaction is hell yes, go in there and make them stop hurting each other! But then what? If you get involved in a fight you will be beaten up as well. I'm not a student of history (the fact that I was predominantly ignorant of the problems in the Balkans until I saw a movie with a pretty face or two in it proves that), but it always seems to boil down to if you get involved you have to stomp pretty hard. Ordinary men, women, and children suffer. How can you insure that things won't get back to the normal business of killing if you leave? Hate is a mighty powerful emotion and you can't make people stop hating each other by getting in their way.

       Ouch. Busy  weekend. I had a ground school Saturday morning with 4 people. 3 of them reinforced my opinion that people who only want to do one skydive need to do tandems.   One was an 18 year old kid. He did fine, but all he wanted to do was one. That fact was merely annoying. His mother, however, was terrified but didn't back down and jumped. She panicked at pull time so I pulled for her. Despite the fact that she had an open and functioning main parachute, she cut it away and went to her reserve. When she landed (and her canopy flying was giving Frank and I heart attacks every time she did a turn), she told me that she cut away because she didn't find the main handle. Apparently she never looked *up*.  I was angry, but I didn't show it to her. I went and calmed down and ended up feeling real sorry for her. She knows she screwed up. She had a terrible time. If she had done a tandem instead, I think she would have had a much nicer time.   The last guy was pretty hard core. He came back Sunday and did 6 more jumps. He is exactly the type of person who should go through AFF - he wants to be a skydiver and the dives I did with him were a lot of fun.  All total I did 10 jumps; 9 AFF. The 10th was a jump with Jeff, a jumper who I've been friends with a long time (since I had about 100 jumps). We met at West Tennessee during a boogie (a skydiver party). He has his tandem rating; he is working on getting his AFF rating so I'm jumping with him to help him with his air skills.   I managed  to procure a video tape of a BBC movie:  urlLink Warriors , about British troops on a United Nations mission in Bosnia in 1992. Why the  Hell  would you send troops somewhere then tie their hands like that? You might as well not send troops at all. Look. Either  be  imerialist pigs, or stay away completely. Argh!  Anyways, I'm about halfway through. The British troops have strict rules of engagement. They can't take sides, so they get to sit there and watch people slaughter other people.   I bought it because my imaginary boyfriend, Damian Lewis is in it. I'm glad there's more to this movie than the pretty scenery.

       urlLink    That plane in the backgound - doesn't it look like something out of a 50's movie? It's a Piper Aztec. Gorgeous plane. Shirtless guy is Glenn. Don't know the other fella.&nbsp; urlLink

       We watched   urlLink Peter Pan  last night. The live action version that came out last Christmas. Enjoyable. Wendy Darling is a preteen who tells her brothers stories. She tells stories like Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty, but she manages to stick pirates into the tales (my kind of girl). Anyway, Pan shows up, etc.etc. etc. Listee Jason Isaacs plays both Mr. Darling, Wendy's mild-mannered dad, and Captain Hook (nice Freudianisms can be gleaned from that arrangement - indeed when Wendy first sees Captain Hook she is fascinated more than afraid). Olivia Williams plays Mrs. Darling. She is a beautiful woman - if you are going to have her in a movie with Jason Isaacs as her husband, couldn't you have one scene where he gives her a kiss? A peck on the cheek? Something? Damn.  Once again JI is the best thing about a movie because he's the Evil Bad Guy. See  Dragonheart ,  The Patriot , and  Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  for further proof.  Speaking of listees, I am in the process of assembling the best photos of my top 10 favorite actors. I'll stick them up here eventually.

       Jon finished  his commercial pilot's testing (and passed) finally, after a few unhumerous delays.    Costa Rica  abolished it's standing army a while back (1949). So far, everything I have read about the country is pretty interesting. I take that back; it's actually a little boring culturally and politically. Cue Harry Lime's Switzerland speech from  urlLink The Third Man . As a libertarian I think that's great. I haven't found any info yet on taxation. The vast majority of government spending is on health and education so I'm assuming both are socialized.  -Hey, prostitution is legal! Not that I'm going to hire a ho. Just glad to see some places are realistic about it. It doesn't look like any kind of drug use beyond the typical tabacco and alcohol are permitted.  It must suck being sandwiched between 2 Banana republics, but then again Panama and Nicaragua have enough problems to where they aren't a problem for Costa Rica. I read a little of one of their on-line english newspapers; like any capitalist country they have illegal immigration problems. Their major industry is tourism. They have 2 coasts (the Pacific ocean on 1 side and the Carribean sea on the other). A huge amount of Costa Rica is protected. Much of their tourism is eco-tourism. That's fine with me. I don't go to different places to see the same old shopping/hotel/tourist traps.  Because of a few recent hurricanes and an earthquake their road system sucks. They have active volcanoes, too; one which we hope to see (Arenal). No, I'm not worried. The chances are slim that I'll get stuck in a natural disaster, and if I do and I survive, I bet I'll get some good stories out of it.  We will be staying at a resort near Tamarindo, which is on the Pacific side. Here's a  urlLink link . It looks kind of brand new. It would normally be a little too touristy for my tastes, but we're staying there for free. I also notice we're travelling on September 11th. Hah. Maybe it won't be crowded.

       180 million  in 6 days. Good for you, Sam and company.    Independence Day Weekend, 2004: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly    Actually, this  bit will be the bad, the ugly, and the good, because I prefer the high notes last.    The Bad:   I woke up Saturday with a muscle spasm in my back. I haven't had one in nearly 7 months; I had almost forgotten about them. At that point in time it was so bad I saw my doctor. The best we could come up with is it's the consequence of an injury I suffered when I was 15 - I broke my 5th thoracic vertabrae in a car accident.  The muscle spasm occurs in the same place every time - slightly to the left of this break but before my shoulder blade. What is essentially happening is a nerve there sends out a signal -"hey, I'm hurt!" causing the muscles to clench up around it, causing it to send out a signal "hey, I'm hurt!" etc. in a wonderful positive feedback loop that translates into a lot of pain and the inability for me to turn my head. Doc prescribed 2 things: Flexaril, which makes me sleepy, and another med that I can't pronounce but it's in the same class of painkillers as Ibuprofen.  The end result was I was a zombie for most of Saturday and Sunday - but my back loosened up finally. I still have some residual stiffness but it's nothing that good old Vitamin I can't take care of.   Also bad  were 2 AFF level 1's. It's getting to the point that I wish people would do Tandems for their first skydive no matter what. We can't make it mandatory; not without losing business to other drop zones. And I do feel uncomfortable with that blanket statement because I never did a tandem and I had a great AFF level 1. BUT - we have a severely low student retention rate - everybody does. Less than %10 of the people who do AFF go on to complete the training. Most of the time it is because they only want to do one jump. They do AFF because they think it's more macho. This attitude is stupid, mea culpa's notwithstanding. You are leaving a freaking airplane! Take someone with you who knows what they are doing for the whole ride. You might learn something, like whether you want to do it again.   I have developed certain prejudices: I like AFF 1's with: young men, especially military men, and women. Young men think they're invincible, so while they are scared, they aren't as scared as older men. Military men listen to instruction better, as do women. Women also tend to be more flexible and can arch better than men. Plus women tend to be smaller, so I don't have to worry as much about handling them if things go bad.  Anyways, both the level 1s were older gentlemen. They couldn't arch, and they had their feet on their ass the whole skydive. They both failed to respond to hand signals and had to have their parachutes pulled for them. One of them was real nice but had no short term memory. The other one seemed to remember better but was a real jackass. I hope neither of them ever show up at our drop zone again.   I hate being an ageist. It's wrong. I have known some fantastic skydivers who are in their sixties. The biggest difference: they are in shape. Astounding shape. Their dedication to keeping themselves physically fit seems to keep their minds fit, as well. So that's a nice word of advice to all of us rapidly aging couch potatoes: get up and move!    The Ugly:   The AFF's were on Saturday. I slept most of Saturday afternoon and most of Sunday. I woke up and my back felt good enough that I wanted to do a skydive. A thunderstorm was headed our way, but by all reports we had time for one more load. We were wrong. By the time our full (13 people) load got up to altitude, the storm had swept over the drop zone and the pilot was informed that the winds on the ground were 14 knots gusting to 22.   We all decided to land with the plane. Once the pilot got us under the thunderhead, the wind gusts shook us pretty good. We were dropped in a wind shear near the ground; the pilot fought hard but got us on the runway safely. As I told someone as we left the plane, I was really surprised that there weren't 13 holes pinched into the carpet on the plane's floor. Rick earned his money (and a lot of gratitude from us) that day. He won't have to buy any beer for a while.   Also ugly:  Drunk guys with fireworks. Also certain husbands who know how to construct acetelyne (sp?) bombs. I won't go into more details; suffice to say no one got hurt.    The Good:   The T-storm on Sunday passed pretty fast so the 4th of July demonstration jump into a football stadium in Huntsville went off as planned. It is an annual event; after the jump there's a honking fireworks display. Our tradition is to load up the Skydive Alabama van with people and beer and get into the show for free as 'ground crew'. We didn't stay for the fireworks because we were all too hungry. After the successful demo, we all took off in the van, drank like crazy, and hunted down a Japanese restaraunt. Some of us had a hankering for sushi.  I was amused - wasn't this what I was doing when I was 17? Except we were looking for a Taco Bell or a Krystal's then.   Also good:  a 17 point 4-way and a 4-point 10 way. I'm especially happy with the last jump (these were on Monday) because I normally don't get to do "big" ways (jumps with more than 4 people) that are that successful. I'm also proud of the homegrown jumpers who were on that skydive; I feel like I've accomplished something when I see them go out there and do good. *Sniff!*    Also good:  and this just made the whole weekend for me: one of the older jumpers, Mark, invited Jon and I to Costa Rica for a week. He and his wife have a free week in a condo there (his wife's parents own the place) and there's a second bedroom. He thought of us because he knows we like travel. I checked Travelocity and the ticket prices were entirely reasonable. We weren't going to do any kind of travel this year (except maybe to the Gulf Coast or Tennessee) but since the place to stay was free, we both jumped at the opportunity. Hooray!  I will post details of the trip as I know more.

       Ah, Friday.  Today is the first day in a long time where I haven't started the day drugged up. I feel washed out; kind of tired.   I couldn't  force Jon away from his computer last night; I'm not going to watch  Evil Dead II  unless I have someone to inflict it on. So I watched  Spider-Man . I think my initial reaction to  Spider-man II  is correct; the sequel is a superior movie. How often do I get to say that?  Aliens ,  The Empire Strikes Back ,  Godfather II ...  I still love and enjoy the first movie. Raimi, however, didn't seem to be speaking with his own unique voice. I point out the entire "World Unity Festival" sequence. Too much seems to be borrowed from Tim Burton's  Batman . I liked  Batman  but it didn't capture my imagination the way the Spider-Man franchise does (I could say the same thing for the comic books themselves). Like I said previously, I think the studio suits had decided that Raimi has the ability to create a movie that would make them bucks so they backed off.   Afred Molina comes off better than Willem Dafoe, but I don't neccessarily think that's entirely fair. Doc Ock's costume didn't have his face covered which allowed more emoting. I also noticed that Maguire (yes, I finally figured out how to spell his name) got to keep his mask off for a good deal of the second movie which allowed us to appreciate his acting that much more. Yes, I think nerd-boy is a fine actor. After the first movie I sought out a few of his other movies:  The Cider House Rules ,  Pleasantville ,  Wonder Boys , and some of the things he's done with Ang Lee ( Ride with the Devil  and  The Ice Storm ). He's a good actor. He's unfortunately saddled with that 'boyish' look but that works well in his favor for the web slinger. Take for instance, Orlando Bloom. Imagine him as Spider-Man. Can't, can you? He hasn't yet shown any ability to display strong emotions.  Also better were the CGI action sequences. Spidey's still a bit cartooney, but it's not as egregious as it was in the first movie. I feel stupid complaining about cartooney action in a comic book movie.  How about themes? The first movie's theme was spelled out to us: with great power comes great responsibility. Parker's guilt-driven motivation to do good struck me as realistic, but the theme didn't resonate with me the way the theme of the second movie did.  Spider-Man II 's theme seemed to be that in order to do the right thing, to stay on the right path, sacrifices must be made, even if it means giving up your dreams.  For this selfish little Libertarian that's mighty heavy, and sacrifice is a word that sticks in my craw. No one should have to feel like they have to stay miserable.  When Peter walked away from Spider-Man, I was on his side. It's  his  life! But I can understand why he went back; having to deal with his concience ended up making him more miserable than before.   But There has to be a way to do the right thing  and  to find the things that make you happy. That's why the subway scene made me feel verklempt, and Mary Jane's decision at the end had me BVD'ing for joy.   Well, I  hope you had your hip boots on for that last segment! Did I mention that I liked this movie?

       Top 10 Reasons Spider-Man II is a great movie:    WARNING!  I did not leave out the spoilers! Go back now! I'm warning you!! Go AWAY! Go  urlLink here  and see what Lileks is blathering about. His blather is usually far more entertaining than mine anyway.     Are you still here? Look. Here's someplace else to visit:  urlLink simply the best  review of the original  Spider-Man .     I warned you:   10:  Wierd violin woman. "Spider-man, spider-man. Does whatever a spider can.."   9:  A free nerdboy is a happy nerdboy. "Raindrops keep fallin on my head..."   8:  Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson show up again. Bruce Campbell and Ted Raimi show up again. Is it just me or is Bruce looking more and more like Fess Parker?   7:  Spidey taking the elevator. "It kind of rides up in the crotch a little.."   6:  J.K. Simmons still manages to steal every scene he's in.   5:  Doc Ock not wanting to die a monster. For that matter, keeping the final battle short. The subway battle was the centerpiece; no WAY were they going to try to top that.   4:  Harry finds out who Spider-Man is. Yikes! Mary Jane finds out who Spider-Man is. Whoopsie!   3:  Harry finding his dad's secret pumpkin stash, as well as an extra exo-skeleton, glider, and evil-bad guy transmogrifying liquid. Uh, oh!   2:  The hands coming offscreen to keep Spider-man from falling into the river. The people on the subway promising not to give away Peter's secret when they see his face. He finally gets to see some of the good he's managed to accomplish (never mind Aunt May's sanctimonious speeches. The looks on their faces explain far more in far less time).   1:  Peter accepting his fate but Mary Jane doesn't. Mary Jane saves Peter Parker's life. Yay! The girl got the spider! Hooray!   Okay, now that you're  thoroughly  spoiled, I just want to say how much I loved Mary Jane when she ditches what's-his-name at the altar to go after the man she loves (and who loves her). I love the fact that Mary Jane loves the whole package; both Peter and Spider-man and totally accepts who he is and what he feels compelled to do. Yes, I realize that Peter is right in not wanting to endanger anybody and yes I know something awful might (might? will!) happen to her in the 3rd movie, but face facts: Harry all ready  knows  what Mary Jane and Peter feel for each other, and Harry is going to be the principal villain in  Spider-Man III . So I wish them as much love and happiness as possible in the meantime.  I  told  you it was a chick movie!

       No update  yesterday; I felt sickly due to allergies so I went home and slept for 5  hours. Damn that felt good. Only got up because I had a doctor's appointment. He strongly urged me to go back to using Nasonex; plus he gave me a prescription for Allegra. I am happy to report it doesn't make me sleepy like Claritin does.   I couldn't  help myself; I then talked Jon into going to see  urlLink Spider-Man II . I am happy to report that I loved it.  Well, I loved the first movie. This one is better. Really! All that critical hyperbole may be warranted in this case.  I will do my best to remain spoiler-free:  2 years after the funeral of Norman Osborne Peter Parker is still where we left him: he fights crime but he can't have a normal life. His dual identity is wearing way thin; he can't hold a job, his college grades are suffering, and he's alienating the few friends and family he has. To top it all off in his frustration he starts losing his superpowers. He does all of these remarkable things and he gets nothing in return; just a lot of bad press and loneliness.   I wrote before (borrowing heavily from someone else) that chick movies and actions movies are bastard children of the Romantic movement. Well, here you go: a movie that perfectly blends both genres. This is an action movie, but much of the screen time deals with eternally put-upon Pete and his disentigrating relationships. This is a chick movie, but Spidey gets to whoop ass and have his whooped in return.  Spider-Man had a good villain; a scientist whose experiments go haywire and they turn him into an evil villain. He still manages to maintain some of our sympathy. Spider-Man II doesn't tinker with the formula; Dr. Octopus is a worthy bad guy that we feel kinda sorry for. Alfred Molina does a great job; he even gets to Muahahahaha several times.  Sam Raimi is a personal god; I saw  Evil Dead  way back when it was originally released in the theaters, I'm bragging to say; and  Evil Dead II  remains to this day one of my favorite movies to whip out on an unsuspecting friend (as Nancy can attest to. She got me back by showing me  Pink Flamingos ). I liked  The Gift  and  A Simple Plan , and  Darkman  gave us geeks early hints as to what Raimi could do with a comic book movie.  This movie is Sam Raimi's baby; after the resounding success of the first one the suits at Columbia let him loose and it shows. His love of slapstick is apparent with plenty of (painful) visual gags, his unabashed corniness, odd camera angles, and a WTF montage featuring a song I won't mention for fear that it will get stuck in my head. Many things have all ready been written about the operating room sequence and its similarity to some of the insanity of  Evil Dead II  (Chainsaws! whoops, that was a spoiler). Did I say corny? Yeah, but the cornball scenes are also effective. The entire sequence on the subway train and the passengers' reaction to Spiderman was heartbreaking. In a  good  way.  Raimi also loves and respects the characters. This is one action movie where the hero is far more interesting than the bad guys. McGuire's innate nerdiness comes to the fore here; he also has an intensity that's hard not to respond to. No wonder Mary Jane loves him.   And speaking of Mary Jane; some critics have said Kirsten Dunst is the weak link in the picture. They are smoking some bad stuff (it's James Franco, but he did a good job too). Her frustration over Peter's hot/cold attitude is understandable, and when she moves on, I can't blame her. But in the end, her choices made me want to stand up and cheer. Or at least do the Boykin Victory Dance as inobtrusively as possible in my theater chair (Jon looked at me kind of funny).  The best thing about this movie is that the story moves  forward . It isn't merely a rehash of the first movie, the characters grow and their relationships change. Shit happens! It's still way too early to put it on my top 10 but this movie definitely earned an "I loved it!". Way to go, Raimi, can't wait for Spidey III.   Oh wait, yes I can. This is Peter Parker we're talking about. Considering that McGuire, Dunst, and Raimi all have no desire to do a part 4, one wonders what kind of hell Parker is going to be put through for 3. Yikes.  I'm going to go see it again. Best praise I can give any movie. In the meantime, I think I'll inflict some  Evil Dead II  on my husband tonight...

       I'm off  the diet train until I get back from Rantoul. Here's hoping I don't blow what little progress I made.   The answer  to yesterday's question was:  "It stinks!" .   I had  a back spasm yesterday. I took it for as long as I could, then I went home and dosed myself with by back meds, and slept for about 16 hours. I feel washed out, but hey my back feels better.

       Same old, same old .  In the rumor department: Negative on the Eric Bana/James Bond rumor (thanks, Helly!), thank goodness. Bond movies are jokes. Ralph Fiennes will be playing Voldemort, however. Yay!         I'm feeling nostalgic today:   With a pickle mind, we kick the nipple beer. Steady as a goat, we're flying over trout. Ghetto down the highway at the speed of light.  All I want to feel now is the wind in my eyes.  Sack of monkeys in my pocket, my sister's ready to go. Hear the engines roll now. Idiot control now. Hideous control now. Nitty on the road now. Midi in control, wheels on fire, burning rubber tires! Near each other rolls now. He really loves me, go now. Needy inches bow down. Pity and a poor boy. Hear the engines roll, bees on pie, burning rubber tires.   What do you think?

       Day 10 *hah* 140.2 pounds.  Last night we had company over. It wasn't the food so much as the beer. Oh, well, I'll just keep going.  No update yesterday because I was working my butt off. Wish that were true; then I wouldn't have to keep eating so much tuna.   Random thinking day   Trey Parker and Matt Stone are making a new movie:  urlLink Team America: World Police . I am so there, even though puppets give me nightmares. I'm especially loving the buzz: liberals are wondering if this movie will liberal bash and conservatives are wondering if it will conservative bash. Both groups: of course it will. Nothing is sacred to these guys. Explicit puppet sex scene? Oh, god, I'll never get any sleep tonight.  When did Stephen Baldwin (the goofy looking Baldwin brother. No, the REALLY goofy looking one) find God? Has anyone spotted him on the 700 club yet? He is making Christian movies. If he's happier, then good for him.  I'm reminded of a South Park ep about Christian Rock - there is a huge market for Christian-themed art (music, movies, etc) and sometimes I bet some of the artists are thinking to themselves 'there's gold in them thar hills' as opposed to actual prayer. Maybe I'm being cynical. Not that Stephen is doing this.  I avoided any coverage of the DNC just like I'll studiously avoid the Republican convention. I was unable to avoid one picture of demonstrators burning an effigy with two faces:  Kerry on one side, and Bush on the other. If they had constructed it as a huge pinata, a photograph of a mass of people fighting and scrambling for candy as the pinata burst open would have been a far more apt political statement. Oy, where's that deserted island I ordered? I'll protect it with sharks with frickin laser beams on their head.  Yellowtail Merlot is mighty tasty.    urlLink Brides , the latest non-BBC TV movie Damian Lewis is in, is rumored to be shown at the Toronto Film Festival. I hope a U.S. distributor will pick it up; I'll still have to wait for DVD. The trailer should be up on the web in a few days. Lewis plays an American photographer who falls in love with a Greek mail-order bride who is sailing to America on the same ship as he. A more detailed description of the plot makes it seem like a four-hanky romance, but part of me was humming 'the Love Boat' while I was reading it. But still, if he doesn't smack her around or rape her, it will be a step up role-wise.  I know a man who is having an affair with a married woman (whom I also know). Without going into details, I am horribly fascinated by their relationship. I won't judge them; if they want to be together that's their business. But am I surreptitiously watching a romance, or a train wreck? I hope the former but I suspect the latter. I know a woman who is having an affair with a married man (whom I don't know). Her life is a train wreck; but she was pretty well psychotic beforehand. Cupid is an incorrect image; Love is a fearsome rabid beast that likes to bite people on the ass.

       Day 8 PSMF:  Still 138.2 temp is the same. Stairsteps.  Gotta admit I cheated on Saturday. I had to, those pizzas were causing me to drool! Anyway, I'm back to it now. I'm feeling a lot of muscle burn because of the lack of glycogen in them. It made skydiving interesting. I did 8 this weekend, including several with an ex-student of mine, Jenn, who lives in Wisconsin, I think. She came down with some friends for the weekend. She was one of my first students. I'm so proud! *Sniff!*   As far as the Ultimate Politics Survey goes - I hear Eric Bana is still up for the next James Bond. I still think he would make a better one than some of the names being bandied about. His English accent will need some work.   Also, Ralph Fiennes is rumored to be playing Voldermort in the next Harry Potter book. Him and Jason Isaacs in the same movie, playing bad guys. Now if they would cast my favorite redhead as the eldest Weasely son, I will die happy. Well, actually, I would wait on the dieing bit until I actually saw the movie.  And another thing: I am *not* going to go see the Village just to see the Batman Begins teaser! I already know the twist because so many reviewers worked hard at not revealing it. I still loved  Unbreakable  the most of Shyamalan's movies.  So that's my political stance on *those* issues, and there's not a damn thing you can say to me to change my mind!
