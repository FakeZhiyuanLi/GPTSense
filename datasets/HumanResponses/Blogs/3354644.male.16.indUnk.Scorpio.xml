       When I grow up and I can afford a house, why should I spend all my money on nothing here in Southern California? Nahh...it's so expensive here...I'd rather go out of state to find a more house for the money. Someplace with scenery like  this :   urlLink      urlLink     p.s. I'll give you...umm... something  if you can guess what state those two pictures were taken...

           I guess sometimes in life it's good to write things down to clear your head. I haven't been doing that much lately...I wonder how I've changed as a person this last year. I think back to the beginning of the year and I can't help wondering if I've grown as a better person than I started this year as. I hate to turn this post into some kind of God commercial, but when you care about something so passionatly and with so much energy, it can't be helped when it overflows into all aspects of life. I don't know what it is...I guess C.S. Lewis puts it into a perspective that I can describe it as in his "Mere Christianity."                 "If I find in myself a desire which no experience in this world can satisfy, the most probable explanation is                  that I was made for another world."   This world is so empty. There doesn't seem to be an kind real purpose or reason to exist in this mundane way. School, homework, school, homework. I guess I can fill it with worldy and small "happy" moments where life seems to be perfect for that one awesome night, but why? Why should I waste time, money, and energy in seeking after something so...Meaningless? So I can feel good? Ha. Isn't that what life is all about? Society seems to be feeding us this concept of "whatever feels good is good for you" but in reality, that can't be further from the truth. Our flesh and minds are constantly seeking after the things that tend to destroy us. We can glorify the things that this society has come to value so much but reality will always be true no matter how sugar-coated they are. Unfortunately, everyone fails. No one is perfect. No one can live a life completely free from immoral actions. Why are we made like this? Why must we be CREATED to FAIL? I think the answer lies in the creator: God. God. Why is that such a taboo word? How has God become such a heatedly debated topic? Why are supposed intellectuals so keen on denouncing the existence of God? Can it be that their own immoral desires make it convenient NOT to believe in an all-mighty law giver? While this is a possibility for many, others can see him as unfair. Why would he de unfair to ME? Why would he do WRONG to me? WHY ME? THAT'S why He doesn't exist. There CANNOT be a JUST and KIND God that allows such gratuitous evil here on earth. Hold on. Let's examine that for a second. Other than that being quite a selfish reason, let's check on the logic behind that. THere cannot be a God that allows such evil? OK, so, if you believe in the concept of evil, than, you must also believe that there is good. SO, you must also believe that there is a universal moral law. Then, there MUST also be a universal moral law GIVER. It couldn't sprung out of nowhere and no mere human ancestor could have just developed it as a tool for survival, morality goes against the selfish desires of man. They are a sacrifice on the individual for order. So if it isn't from some random step, than what, or rather WHO is it from? This is where an individuals judgement comes in. There is absolutely no concrete proof that GOD exists. AND, there is absolutely no proof that GOD does NOT exist. SO, one can come to their own conclusion. I happened to have concluded that a supreme being created and implanted the concept of morality into each and every human being. There are certain wrongs and certain goods that we are all born to understand. A wrong for example, rape and murder, and a good being love. Of course, people can have their judgment on what they prefer, but I believe that deep down everyone knows between good and evil. The fact that this person can ask why God can let the possibility of evil to exist points to the fact that there is such a thing as moral law. He might also ask how God could let someone die and kill someone who lived a good life. Saying this about God doesn't make sense because if God is the creator of life and he gave that life to that person, who is to say that the creator is even taking the life when he also has the power to restore it to the very purpose of it which is to enjoy that relationship w/ him and to glorify him. God's answer to our pain and the evil in this world is His gift to us, a sign of his mercy, his son Jesus Christ who died in place of us so that we may have life.  ------  Also, why do we believe that God's purpose is human happiness? that's so stupid. We put him into this little box where if he doesn't do what WE think he should do, than he doesn't exist. We only believe what conveniences us. And who are we to say that some suffering is gratuitous? If you look at the countries with the greatest amount of suffering, it is almost a 1:1 correlation of the rapid growth in the Christian church. And on the flipside, wherever there is material wealth and comfort, the growth is nonexistent, or even declining. We need to keep in mind that God's purposes in life are much broader than what is conducive to our happiness. His ultimate purposes are to establish the Kingdom of God. Furthermore, anyone's suffering must be seen in light of the cross. God isn't just some high and holy being that does whatever he does. He actually suffered on the cross for us, to show us the extent of his abounding love. Then, the problem comes into an entirely different perspective. Now the problem is not how God can justify himself before us, it is how WE who sin and who are morally corrupt can justify ourselves before HIM. Then, we can see the cross and ask, if God can suffer that much and bear that incredible burden of the WORLD'S sin, than surely I can endure this brief bit of suffering on earth that He has asked me to endure for HIm.         ++++-----------------------------++++    Society has come to a point where information is almost completely hand fed to us. Whatever we see on television or hear on the radio must be true. Our generation has become one so dependent on the thinking of others that we are no longer able to think for ourselves. In an age of inundation of information, how are we to take all this in and process it to apply to our own lives? All we do is take it at face value and accept it as truth. Now, granted this is quite a generalization and there are many incredible minds out there, but as a whole, society seems to have fallen into quite a rut. How are we to climb out of this grave we have dug for ourselves? What are we to make of the demoralization of the world? I think the answer once again lies in the Creator.     \\\~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~///    On a completely different note, here's something I found and kept earlier in life. I never knew the extent to which it would ring true....     It's Raining in Love   -by Richard Brautigan  I don't know what it is, but I distrust myself when I start to like a girl      a lot.  It makes me nervous. I don't say the right things or perhaps I start        to examine,                        evaluate                                    compute        what I am saying.  If I say, Do you think it's going to rain?" and she says, "I don't know," I start thinking: Does she really like me?  In other words I get a little creepy.  A friend of mine once said, "It's twenty times better to be friends      with someone than it is to be in love with them"  I think he's right and besides, it's raining somewhere, programming flowers and keeping snails happy.       That's all taken care of.                      BUT if a girl likes me a lot and starts getting real nervous and suddenly begins asking me funny questions and looks sad if I give the wrong answers and she says things like, "Do you think it's going to rain?" and I say, "It beats me," and she says, "Oh," and looks a little sad at the clear blue California sky, I think: Thank God, it's you, baby, this time     instead of me.
