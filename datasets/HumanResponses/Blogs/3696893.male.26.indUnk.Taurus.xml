      OK, if you got a call from me today on your messaging services, I was not on drugs. That's just sleep deprivation mixed with joy. I hate insomnia *sigh*  My holiday's back on! YAY! If you're reading this, you may remember from an earlier entry that the collapse of Ansett Airlines in Australia (Australia's second biggest airline) resulted in me losing my holiday that I'd booked last year.  Well, Ansett Mark II (yes, that's the name of the company!) were able to arrange it all for me. So if you're in Adelaide, Melbourne or Canberra I should be in your neighbourhood sometime next month :) I'll be staying in a nice motel/B&B in the South Yarra area in Melbourne, arrangements have yet to be pinned down for the other two.  I am so happy!! Oh, and in my semi-weird state this morning I phoned The Met, Melbourne's public transport company, and ended up on the phone for nearly an hour to a really nice CSO ... She reckoned I was the nicest person to have called her all year, and liked my insights on customer service from the inside (she could relate to nearly all of them :)  Anyway, time to leave this aside. I'm at work, and plenty of work to be done, and I doubt I'll be awake at the end of my shift. But oh well ...

      I haven't updated here for a while as it's been either work or busy since I got back on Sunday night. We're not getting the entire Christmas break, I have to work every working day except Christmas Eve over the period 9-5, except NYE when I managed to negotiate 8-4.  Fun stuff, eh? I have left the parting Canberra side of things aside for a later time, but it was completely mental. I'll give you the 2 minute summary to keep you intrigued:  1. There is no public bus to the airport, and the shuttle does not run weekends. I was parting Canberra at 3:30pm on a Sunday.  2. I got a bus to the city and then another to an "industrial" area called Fyshwick.  3. Everybody on the bus reminded me of the front page of http://batemanimation.com (EDIT: now folded into Scott Bateman's other enterprises, page had deranged idiots bleating at each other randomly), they were all completely mental and had serious issues.  4. Attempting to get a taxi from Fyshwick, 2 suburbs from the airport, to the airport involved: a. The phone ringing out twice b. When I finally got through, having to argue with an unfriendly operator. c. No cab for 10 minutes. d. Having to use a mobile number for a driver which he'd given me earlier in the week to obtain a taxi, which promptly arrived.  The flight was easy enough, and I got to Perth at 7:50pm local time (10:50pm EDT, 11:50am GMT). Oh, and getting a regional airline when you are right next to the propeller is a bad  idea - it's like sitting in front of a stroboscope for 45 minutes and I couldn't see when I got off in Melbourne Airport.

      Before continuing, I'll explain here that Canberra has two city centres, so in order to avoid confusion Canberrans call the seat of Federal Parliament "Capital Hill" on south of Lake Burley Griffin, and the commercial and banking city area "Civic", on the north bank. They are linked by a bridge road called Commonwealth Avenue. Most of the attractions in Canberra are in the Capital Hill region.  I thought I'd use this post to explain some of the oddities one or two of my friends have heard about already by mobile phone. So if this is old ground, you know who you are. :)  1. Conversation on bus yesterday. From back - tall guy in black shirt, about 18, two rough looking guys in their late 30s or early 40s (Man and Other Man), to their right a mid-teen couple (Boy and Girl) who are making out on the seat. I was sitting directly in front of them, and to my left (to the men's front) was a stately looking middle aged lady (Lady). Everyone I've repeated it to thinks it's the funniest yet.  Man: You know what pisses me off? Other Man: What, mate? Man: Wankers. Other Man: Yeah. Man: They're everywhere. Wankers everywhere you go. Other Man: Too true, mate. Man: Wankers, wankers, wankers. Can't get away from them.  [Boy stops making out with Girl just long enough to say]  Boy: Hey, would you mind toning down the language a bit? Man: Are you offended by "wankers"? Boy: Yes, I am. Man: Would "tossers" be better? Would you be offended by "tossers"?  [Guy at back and me laugh softly so as not to attract attention. Men fall silent for about 3-4 mins]  Other Man: We've been on f##king welfare for 20 years. Man: Yeah, it pisses me off, you know?  Lady: I'm offended too. If you don't stop talking like that, I'm going to have to get a higher authority, and they'll do something about it. Just you see.  [Men shake heads, boy at back and me laugh a little] [Boy and Girl get off bus] [Men stay silent all the way to Woden, where Lady gets off. Once she's off:]  Man: F##king wanker.  [Other man shakes head, then they alight from bus.]   2. Christmas carols at Woden shopping centre. In keeping with the fact that most people listen to rap here (apparently there was a riot at a cinema when a recent movie preview with Dr Dre (EDIT: 'Training Day') aired and only a certain number of people could get preview tickets), they have jazzed up the children's choir a bit by adding a boom box. Hearing the children sing in time with the boombox was somewhere between amusing and vastly depressing. The teachers told me they'd been training for 3 weeks. It was apparently supposed to mean Christmas was relevant even in the present day.   3. A certain fast food outlet - I won't say where it was as I perfectly understand the teens' predicament.  Man: I'd like a meal deal. Female Cashier (about 15): Certainly, sir. Would you like ketchup with that? Man: No, but I'd like a tomato sauce. Cashier: Yes, certainly, one ketchup. Man: No! I said tomato sauce. What part of that don't you understand? Cashier: We have to call it ketchup, sir. [Quietly - but I was nearby] I hope you understand, but we are not allowed to call it anything other than ketchup, you can get fired for less. Man: OK. [Spitefully] Ketchup, then. You have lemon squash? Cashier: Lift or Sprite? Man: Just lemon squash would be fine. Cashier: Well, we have Lift, and we have Sprite. Man: Don't bother. I'll go to KFC where they don't go in for this American crap.  [Man leaves store]  Obviously he doesn't know what that K stands for :)

      The section of the holiday in Canberra has been substantially more mundane and boring than the previous sections.. In two days, I will be back in Perth, and I won't deny that I view that as something of a positive.  Basic summary of holiday in Canberra to date.   Monday 10th  3:00pm - Arrived in Canberra as previously detailed on Kendell Airlines flight 8528. 4:30pm - Set off for city centre, ended up with National Library, dinner and walk. 9:30pm - Returned to Canberra Central Apartments to spend my night there. Talked with Steven.   Tuesday 11th  8:30am - Breakfast at Canberra Central, and checkout. 10:30am - Went to Belconnen shopping centre. Kmart's passport photography centre dead. Got my Kodak disposables from Melbourne developed at highly overpriced cost. ($16 a piece, and no free folder) 2:30pm - Emerged tired, hungry and annoyed from Belconnen, went to Civic. 4:00pm - Not much joy there, although I had time to post the previous entry. Returned to Belconnen to pick up photos. Thankfully, they worked out. 7:00pm - Left there, arrived at Stuart's place 20km S of the city to nice home-cooked meal. He had to go out so I had a long lost reunion with 2 of my CDs (Stabbing Westward and Manic Street Preachers) which cheered me up no end and then chatted to Jon.   Wednesday 12th  10:30am - Woke up. 12:00pm - Somehow ended up back at Belconnen. Just don't ask. 4:00pm - after concluding service standards at this shopping centre are at an Australia-wide low, not limited to extremely poor service while collecting a refund for passport photos I was very unhappy with, experience great catharsis by filling in a Westfield "How did we serve you?" form. It contained no swearing or abuse, but was in very strong terms. I felt better afterwards. 6:00pm - Back in Civic. I noticed I had a bit of a sore throat and cough, but as I regularly have sinus issues, wrote it off as nothing. Came home to more home cooking - this time a form of spaghetti bolognese. Was nic :) 11:00pm - After chatting with Steven, begun to realise this was no ordinary cough and started drinking large amounts of fluids, taking Vitamin C.   Thursday 13th  8:40pm - After various rather revolting episodes in the dunny overnight, woke up for the last time with a full blown headache and sinus cold (what people call the flu, but it isn't influenza). 12:30pm - Finally made up my mind to leave the house. Went to Civic. 2:00pm - Got ripped off by foreign taxi driver en route to Telstra Tower. The views of the city were beautiful - Canberra is a very spaced out city with lots of green and forested areas throughout its suburbs. I enjoyed a small snack on top of the Tower. 4:30pm - Left tower. Some weird notion possessed me to take a shortcut by walking through the forest instead of catching a cab down the winding road. 6:00pm - Got to bottom, quite exhausted and dehydrated (it was, after all, 27oC) but I was happy I'd done it. Caught cab to Civic, bought drink, went home. 11:30pm - After nice long chat with Stuart, went to bed.   Friday 14th  8:30am - Woke up. Internet down, so decided to go out despite cold/flu and the prevailing humidity that's kicked in today. 12:00pm - After getting my photos done *properly*, I went to New Parliament House intending to stay there maybe half an hour. 2:30pm - Emerged from New Parliament House. OK, the rest of Capital Hill can wait till tomorrow, I guess. Went back to Civic and this time went into the shops there and had a pie and a litre of Solo Lemon Squash. (OK, I was thirsty). 4:00pm - Returned but caught wrong bus! Ended up at Woden shops (6-7km SSW). 5:00pm - After intense levels of boredom and amusement, left for Tuggeranong shops (15km S). 7:00pm - Returned home. Tuggeranong's a nice place, just strange. 9:30pm - The present time. Stuart will return later, he's out role-playing. I'm amusing myself by playing with my LJ style and drinking lots of water to combat the humidity and my headache.

       Monday 10 December 2001 , Melbourne  Spent my final hours in Melbourne in the city, the weather changed at least four times while I was there. Got back and had missed the Skybus, so had to get a taxi for $40 to the airport. When I got there, the flight had been so delayed that I could have caught the Skybus anyway. Damn. I also failed the security check as I have so many coins, keys, and god knows what else on my person that I had to take them all out and put them in trays then pick them up again. The guards, thankfully, were very sympathetic, treating it as some kind of machine anomaly and they apologised a few times.  The flight to Canberra, a city of barely 300,000 - well, my first ever time on a  urlLink regional airline . 42 seater, with sheepskin seats. No safety video with a column of female attendants performing in synchronicity what I call the "Emergency Exit Macarena" - there was just one guy reading a transcript of the video. It was noisy as we were close to the motor, and when they told us there'd be turbulence coming into Canberra it would be nice if they had warned us we could pick yesterday's breakfast up on the way down. Eugh.  A friend unexpectedly met me at Canberra and drove me to the city, I hadn't seen him in 4 years so it was a good experience all round :) hopefully I'll be going to a cafe or something with him later in the week. My apartment was beautiful - shame I only got 1 night in it. It had balcony views of parts of the city and the mountains tracing the outline of the city.  I then went for a long walk, during which I discovered the following things: (1) The average speed on main roads in Canberra is 80km/h, rather than the usual 60. (2) Drivers in Canberra are completely mental. (3) The people employed to help us tourists know less about the city than their own brochures contain. (4) Ignore any signs indicating costs or closing times - "till late" on a cafe means about 7pm and something advertised at one price could be much higher or lower than advertised. Furthermore, the locals seem to know this and regard you as somewhat silly for not guessing/knowing.  I got some beautiful photos too in the Commonwealth Avenue region of the city overlooking Lake Burley Griffin.   Tuesday 11 December 2001, Canberra   I checked out of my room and headed off to Belconnen, about 6km NW of the city, and got completely lost in a huge shopping centre, then caught the wrong bus and found myself on the NSW border at the far north of the metro area rather than in the city (the driver, thankfully, took pity on me and drove me back).  This place is starting to annoy me. Contrary to expectation, most things are expensive here (sometimes up to twice the price of Per/Adl/Mel), and I don't even get a free presentation folder with my photos. Oh well.  Oh and the Snowy Mountains are too inconvenient to do - it seems none of the tourist companies here have realised the potential in tourism in having people stay in Canberra and go to the Snowies. I'd have to stay there 2 nights and pay an absolute bomb. There are no guided tours whatsoever.  I'd better get off this net terminal and go back to Belconnen to pick up my photos actually, because unlike anywhere else I've been in, "Express 1 Hour" means 4.5 hours. I still can't get over the fact they charge $16.60 to develop a roll.  Hopefully my holiday in Canberra will improve from here. It is a nice city, and maybe my annoyance with its daily norms will subside in a day or so :)

      Tonight is my last night in my second favourite city in Australia, after my own city, Perth. I really am going to miss this place and it's with some sadness that I realise I may not get to come here again for another couple of years. Melbourne's a big city with a soul, unlike Sydney which just comes across to me as lifeless and somehow having lost its way amidst the hustle and bustle. This is my 2nd time in Melbourne - the first being in 1997 living with my ex - and it's probably the only other city where I've genuinely felt at home.  To complete last night's entry, I went down to the Flinders Street station and listened to Chris the busker for around 2 hours, then walked home. This must be one of the few cities where you can walk home at 1am without having to seriously worry about your personal safety (that being said, I did take precautions anyway)  Today was the Great Ocean Road, which runs all the way from Torquay (about 100km SW of Melbourne) to Warrnambool (around 350km west). We didn't go all the way to Warrnambool - we went only to Port Campbell. But the views were magnificent. Huge limestone natural monuments formed by the relentless Bass Strait (between Victoria and Tasmania) and the Southern Ocean (which goes to Antarctica), coloured with the minerals in Australia's soils, meant there was some real sites to see.  I don't really have time to go through all of them, but it was mindblowing, that is for sure. If you want to have a look, go look on Google for pictures of the London Bridge, Loch Ard Gorge, 12 Apostles, Otley Ranges, or the Surf Coast.  Tomorrow at 1:25pm local time, I am off to Canberra. I really wish I'd had more time in Melbourne now - due to the way the flights work I spend one day more in Canberra than either of the other cities, but there is less to do there.

      Enjoyed a real cooked breakfast (as per previous day, and I forgot to mention a beef stroganov dinner I had at the Miami on Thursday night - which was yummy) and then headed off into the city. Today's tour started with a river cruise on the Yarra River, going through from the City of Melbourne through to the port area about 1/2 way up to Port Phillip Bay. We then did a bus tour of the city, seeing some of the tourist attractions of Melbourne itself, before heading off to the Mount Dandenongs (I still don't know why they're not called the Dandenong Mountains, or why they're nowhere near the urban centre of Dandenong). They are simply beautiful - they're like many other forests I've seen but much greener. The mountain ash trees (a member of the eucalypt family common in Australian native forests - there's over 600 of them) remind me a little of the karri trees in Pemberton south of Perth. Unfortunately, I felt the tour rushed through the Dandenongs - I hope to come up here and spend a decent amount of time on them someday.  I've so far spent the evening in the city after having a buffet at the All Seasons Welcome Hotel - wasn't brilliant but was decent (and budget - around $30) and I'm more than overfull :) I should really find something to do - seeing if Chris is playing down at Flinders Street sounds good right about now.

      Friday 7 December 2000, Melbourne - Nearly all of today was spent on a Gray Line tour. None of the pics you see in this section are mine - I have no access to a scanner, and simply looked for good quality representative ones on Google.     12:20 - Picked up from hotel by coach   12:50 - Arrived in city by roundabout route   13:30 - Left Melbourne - went down St Kilda Road (this road is simply phenomenal - two roadways each direction each of two lanes, a big multi-tramway in the middle, and median strips between each, and tree-lined on both sides - it is huge!) and drove down the bayside suburbs with a full commentary.   15:15 - After going somewhat inland, our first stop - Warrook Farm. Apparently it's too wet for the sheep, but there's plenty of kangaroos and wombats (for those of you who think everywhere in Australia has them, it's in fact quite rare to see them without going to a place like this).   16:15 - After a considerable drive (including a causeway), we got to Phillip Island's Koala Conservation Park and got to see real life koalas as well as some information displays.   17:00 - Went to Cowes (the main town of Phillip Island) and, despite the tour guide's recommendations of expensive restaurants, bought a yiro souvlaki at a local fish & chips shop for $5.50, and loved it. I agree with the person who said Cowes is blatantly cashing in on the tourists rather than providing a meaningful gateway to the island, but even so, it was still nice :) I hung around some fishermen and got to meet a couple of other tourists, including Yoko, from Japan, and Joe, from Italy. I'm still stunned at the lack of Australians on the tours I've been on.   19:00 - Seal Rocks, and I wasn't going to pay the $10.50 entry fee, so hung around the free area (shop, binoculars, beach areas). Bought a few soft toys too :) (EDIT 2002 - This centre was destroyed by a tornado 8 months after my visit.)   20:00 - Penguin Parade information centre - saw some of the computerised displays and shops - the centre was busier than some shopping centres I've seen given the time and day.   20:51 - The penguin parade itself. A single shout and everyone was generally heading towards the seated area, but I'd been tipped off to check the boardwalk instead. The penguins are like nothing I've ever seen. They're about 30cm high and they kind of waddle like a duck, and they're just adorably cute :) Basically they all run up from the water onto the beach at sunset in a huge group every night, then once onshore, preen themselves and, in smaller groups, run up to their burrows in the hills surrounding the beach where the chicks are waiting for their nightly feed. The viewing area is floodlit so you can see them pretty easily.   22:00 - It's all over (the penguins haven't stopped running up, but the floodlights are switched off and the boardwalk is closed by the rangers). I should note that any photography or video is banned due to the effect that flashes have on the penguins, however I was easily able to obtain professionally done photos of them taken some years ago relatively easily.    Searching for "phillip island penguin parade pictures" in Google will return a number of links you can look at, and you can look at the  urlLink official site . This so far has definitely been the highlight of my little tour, alongside the Wayward tour I took on Day 4.

      Checkout time at the hotel was 10am, so it was a rush to meet it. One of my Net friends, Jamie from Melbourne, was, oddly enough, in Adelaide, so we spent most of the day together ... we've known each other nearly 6 years but we hadn't managed to meet until now! :) But it worked out great, and I went practically straight from Jamie's car to the airport, where I sweltered in totally un-Adelaide-like humidity waiting for my plane.  The plane flight was just over an hour, was really weird, like taking off into the clouds then coming down almost no time later. There was a lot of turbulence due to the aforementioned weather - when I got into Melbourne it was humid but fine. (It is now even more humid, cold and pelting with rain too - yes, this is a Melbourne summer.) Took the  urlLink Skybus  to Spencer Strete before getting a taxi to the hotel ( urlLink Hotel Claremont , South Yarra) which I'd booked about a month before for my 5-day stay in Melbourne. The taxi driver told me he wouldn't stay there even if he was paid to, and said I was to receive a shock. I ignored his ramblings as that of a disgruntled taxi driver.  Anyway, I got there and paid in advance as per their policy and got to my room and ... Well, that was entirely another story. When I get home, I'll scan in the pics so you can see it, but the double bed took up 3/4 of the room. There was a bit to the left and front of the bed you could *just* squeeze through. The room looked nothing like the photos on their website. There was no fridge, no power point, communal bathroom/toilet down the corridor that stank of chlorine and smoke (the hotel is non-smoking), and the "wardrobe" was this metal wire thing. No telephone, either - they said they might have telephones by mid-2002. It was positively claustrophobic. At least I had my mobile.  So I went down and told the duty manager I was unhappy with the room - he basically said (politely) that it was budget accommodation in Melbourne and my $68 a night was an amazing bargain for the room I did get.  Thanks to my parents who looked diligently on the net (oh yeah, no phone or yellow pages either) I negotiated my way through a city of 3.5 million on public transport (with considerable help from passengers, one of whom missed two trains to find me my tram!) to find two hotels to check out. The first had no free rooms, the second,  urlLink Miami Motor Inn , was amazingly good. The room which I was taken to was $70 and fully kitted out - and even a cooked breakfast chucked in. I was also impressed with the hospitality they showed to someone who had literally wandered in off the street at 11pm.  I ambled back to the Claremont one as they said I had to pay a night, so I thought I might as well use it up. The bed was comfortable enough, so it wasn't a problem. (My exotic view, by the way, was that of a truck loading zone, considering I was in the heart of the best cafe and shopping district in Melbourne).  Woke up to a cereal breakfast - the saving grace of Hotel Claremont was the overabundance of extremely good looking teenagers staying there. (Am I really that snobbish at 23 that I insist on a fully serviced twin/double room when I go to a city for a few days? :)  Had fun with the luggage, as I had to cart it by train and tram to the new place in West Melbourne. I should mention at this point that Melbourne is one of the few cities in the world to not only have maintained a tram system (most cities, including my own, abandoned it decades ago) but have made it a  urlLink modern and efficient mode of transport .  The new hotel room wasn't ready yet so I went back into the city. Melbourne's weather is unpredictable at the best of times, but it was humid and/or wet for most of it. I found the 5-storey Melbourne Central/Daimaru centre in the northern CBD, but couldn't find my way out. I ended up buying a Chinese meal and 2x600mL drinks to keep me happy, and then went back to the hotel and had a well-deserved shower.  I also found the State Library of Victoria (the state of Australia which Melbourne is the capital of) which is actually really decent, and booked a couple of tours for myself (see Day 7 & 8). I spent the evening eating a nice Thai meal and standing in the subway under Flinders Street train station listening to an incredible acoustic guitar player called Chris who also had a decent voice... I might wander back there tonight and see if he's playing tonight.  Then I came back to my hotel and tried to have a conversation with Jon, however it seems to have become a rather unstable phone connection - either Orange (UK) or Optus (Aus) has issues with international bandwidth, I'd say.

      Finally got into a netcafe, so here goes ...  I woke up late, and in the rush managed to miss my bus, so had the Adelaide taxi experience. It was fun - the driver was a nice guy and it wasn't too expensive (it was $11 from where I was into the city).  So I get to the  urlLink tour company , and there's like a minivan outside. I was kind of surprised, but yeah ... it turned out to be amazingly good, with only two others, myself and the driver/tour guide, Bruce. We got around the entire south of Fleurieu Peninsula in it, and it didn't have the limitations of a larger vehicle so we went into quite a lot of nice places. I saw lots of rolling countryside, nice big forested areas (very different to others I've seen as Adelaide is a much drier climate than both Perth and Sydney) and huge, undulating beaches. I had a brilliant meal in the town of Victor Harbor (it was started as a US whaling post, hence the spelling), and had a ride on Australia's only horse-drawn tram. The driver had a great sense of humour and at times quite jokingly turned on the whole Russell Coight touring guide voice. More later... I found out that Wayward also have an Adelaide-Melbourne tour via the Great Ocean Road, might be interesting for a future point in time.  Then I got back to Adelaide (the tour guide deposited me right at Najjar's Cafe in North Adelaide) and I had a great evening out with my Adelaide friend Andrew L, was a great chat and good food too.  When I got back I phoned Jon but the mobile network kept playing up so the convo was very fragmented towards the end... I then had my last night's sleep in Adelaide.

       Sat 1 Dec , 11:15am Perth time (GMT +8.0h) - Boarded Ansett Mark II plane AN342 to Adelaide.        4pm Adelaide time (GMT +10.5h) (written on plane) While the nice white fluffy clouds are great to look at, they become something of a drag after about two hours of nothing but clouds. En route to Adelaide. Ansett Mk II has been an interesting experience. The friendly lady doing regular rounds with plastic cups and bottled water is a relief, although I can't say much for the donated cricket and music videos. We got a cute little snack pack thingy too. After reading the  urlLink Adelaide Advertiser  onboard, I get the impression I'm making for a large country town, but who knows until I land. I'm Bored!!!  6:30pm - At  urlLink Adelaide International Motel  in Anzac Highway, Glenelg North, where I will be spending my next 5 days. We got off the plane *onto the tarmac*, which I thought bizarre and mildly comical. We're only 8-9km from the CBD but looks almost like a cleaned-up version of a Perth outer suburb (like Gosnells or something). I'm about to check out the sights around Glenelg. The motel room looks really nice, but has an old (i.e. 70s era) dial phone and an old TV.  10pm - Back from my trip all over the place. Went to Glenelg (which is basically a quite nice beach with a paved square at the top, and a long street coming out of it with restaurants and shops the way down) and tried to find an affordable restaurant, but failing to do so, bought a steak burger and chips at an overpriced cafe. An identified problem here is getting drinks at an affordable price - I seem to get dehydrated easily. The steak burger and chips was nice but didn't really thrill me, and a random person on the street told me to check out Chinatown in the city (one block from Victoria Square). I'm now glad I did, as I now have special fried rice and beef in black bean in two little containers. I got to check out the Glenelg tram, which is a restored 1929 tram and is actually an integral part of the public transport here (Note 3/12/01 - I found out today they used to be all over Adelaide but now only this one route remains).  I have two disposable cameras (one flash, one non-flash) with me at all times. God knows how the photos will turn out, but we can only hope.   Sun 2/12/01 , 8pm Adelaide time (GMT +10.5h) - Well, I had a fun day. I only got 4 hours sleep, because they had a wedding downstairs with nightclub type music until 11pm, then at 3am the most spectacular lightning storm I've ever seen hit Adelaide. I wish I had better cameras - this was just awesome.   I got bored of being awake at such an early hour and phoned a friend in Northern Ireland, we chatted for a while and it was good hearing a familiar voice again. :) I went into the city fairly early on, checked out  urlLink Rundle Mall  (apparently Australia's oldest shopping mall) and found another good Chinese restaurant there in a food court. Checked out the State Library in North Tce and found out that in the parklands just outside, they have live local music all weekend. I wish they had that in Perth.   (Adelaide is surrounded by a belt of parklands about 800m wide - it's most obvious in  urlLink this photo  I took the following year from the west.)  For my own amusement I then caught an Adelaide train, which reminds me of the Melbourne ones except that they're much cleaner, much more comfy seats and only one carriage. That is to say (for those not familiar with Melbourne trains) that they're about 35 years old and only travel at like 40-50km/h, and have door handles so you manually open the doors to get on. The train stations were also reminiscent of Melbourne. Was going to go to Noarlunga Centre but was advised by several passengers it was a waste of time, so I got off at Brighton beach, south of Glenelg, and ate aforementioned Chinese meal. It was nice, and the weather was even good for the time. (Not for long, but at least I got a good photo of Brighton). I then headed back into the city, and caught up with another friend (Steven) on the phone, he was at the WACA watching Aust vs NZ and it was kind of fun hearing things at the time they happened. I got back to my hotel with very stiff knees and a headache, mostly due to walking a lot and the humidity.  Adelaide is a paradox. Its suburbs are like a reminder of some past point in time, clean, distinctly dated, and a lot of very old cars. The city centre (CBD) on the other hand has wide streets and is fairly bustling. I've almost been hit by cars a few times. They also have weird laws here about pedestrian crossings so it's possible for cars to come in your direction even if you have a little green man - this phenomenon only seems to occur in the city centre.   Mon 3/12/2001  - The main news is that I went to  urlLink Hahndorf , the entirely German town 24km SE of Adelaide. Those in other Australian cities may be astounded that in Adelaide, once you get 4.5km East of the city centre you're in rolling hills and bushland on roads with hairpin bends in them (one called Devil's Elbow even) ... It was a very nice trip with an informative tour guide, and we got 2 hours in Hahndorf. I learned a lot about Adelaide and Hahndorf and the surrounding areas from him - however the stiff knee thing has become a real problem. I also got real strawberries from  urlLink Beerenberg farm , which supplies Qantas as well as a number of major hotels with jams, sauces and other things. They even rode me right back to my motel (a big thing considering how far out it is).  I decided to leave the Adelaide Casino buffet for another night - I'm too full up to really get any value out of it, thanks to the wonderful food in Hahndorf (free scones, a chocolate eclair of the cake variety, and handmade chocolates - what more could one ask for?) I'm having an early night, then checking out Victor Harbor later (More on that later :) I've been told by everyone that I'll enjoy it, it will be more relaxing than the last two days.  Melbourne on Wednesday night ...

      ..today at 11:35am on  urlLink Ansett Mark II , flight AN342, to Adelaide. It's amazing to think I can travel that far in just 3 hours - the wonders of modern flight.  For those who wish to know, the distance between Perth and Adelaide is not dissimilar to that between Belfast, N.Ireland, and Istanbul, Turkey, or between Los Angeles CA and Birmingham AL - it's about 2,600 km.  My itinerary is as follows: 1 Jan - 5 Jan Adelaide (staying in Adelaide Int'l Motel, Glenelg) 5 Jan - 10 Jan Melbourne (staying at Hotel Claremont, South Yarra) 10 Jan - 16 Jan Canberra

      Left Perth on time at 9:00am aboard Virgin Blue - nice leather seats and stuff, was sitting next to an elderly couple, the guy had been a farmer on the Yorke Peninsula for 50 years and we were discussing salinity in WA. The flight actually took us over some quite sobering areas which were just basically salt plains... very sad to think this was all once pristine forest.  Oh and among the 6 or 7 items other than food you could buy on the plane,  urlLink Richard Branson's autobiography  kind of stood out :) The air captain also had a good sense of humour, which made for a very different safety presentation.   urlLink  Photo 1   - View from plane over Adelaide.  urlLink  Postcard   - Victoria Square, Adelaide, from the air.  Arrived in Adelaide, got taxi to the hotel and was very impressed indeed with the motel ( urlLink Royal Coach Motor Inn  - check Google for info). The room's more like what you'd expect for a hotel. I headed out almost immediately and did the  urlLink O-Bahn , which is a guided busway in Adelaide. Was very interesting - looked like a railway line made out of concrete except it was for buses! It's supposed to be the longest of its type in the world and the only one in Australia.  Met my friend Andrew at Tea Tree Plaza and we took the "scenic" route (90km!) back to the city via the Adelaide Hills, went through all sorts of little towns. If I ever do drive in Adelaide, I'll make sure to get a car with very good power steering - windy roads up and down steep hills seem to be the go here. Had a very good Indian dinner at Tandoori King (don't ask me why I went for a beef vindaloo which said "Hot!" on it in a menu written by Indians... but it was nice when I got over the burnt tongue) Got to see a bit of Adelaide nightlife in the city... it's not exactly stellar but I guess it serves the local purpose.  I've just walked through the eastern end of the city and am now at a net cafe.

      Having lots of fun planning my trip. Only 2 days to go! It's scary how much you can preplan these things. It looks like my time in Melbourne will be very busy - with out-trips to Phillip Island (commercial tour), Mt Dandenongs (on public transport), Mornington Peninsula (on public transport) as well as just getting around Melbourne. Having money is good *nods* I'm also going to get in as much of Launceston as possible in the two days I'm there.  That being said, I think I'll rename this trip from a friend's suggestion of "Andy's tour of the coldest parts of Australia" to "How to spend lots of money on public transport all in the name of having fun". :P  Anyway, cheers. I think this is the first day it's finally hit me that I'm just about to head off into the yonder!

      I'm now in Hobart, having come through a lot of places.  I had to rush into Melb to get a backpack and on impulse I also got for myself an aromatherapy calming candle and back of paper notepads from a place called " urlLink The Reject Shop " (what a cool name for a discount store!) both turned out to be useful later.  Flight to Launceston was uneventful - but I was surprised to note it has a bigger airport than Adelaide. Not bad for a city of 70,000... Got a ride into the city on one of the freeways which was quite scenic and the next surprise was my room at North Lodge Motel. It was HUGE! For $60.50 I'd managed to score a double ensuite room with a central room bigger than my games room, a fully operational kitchen, an ensuite bedroom which was equally large and a considerably nice balcony.  Launceston for a city of its size was the next surprise. It is a real city, not like Bunbury or somewhere. City centre was quite happening if a bit slow and it took ages to walk around it all. I even got a nice iced chocolate at a Viennese coffee shop. Just 2 minutes after leaving the west end of the CBD, I reached Cataract Gorge - a 150ft high cliff face with forests all over it, majestic rocks and a river flowing down the bottom. Stopping and listening you'd never believe it was 500m from the heart of a city. Dinner was local salmon and vegies, cooked by yours truly :P   urlLink  Link to my photos for the Tasmania trip    I've spent the last 4 days in the west and north west of Tasmania and have been amazed by both how green it is and how large - from seeing it on a map you wouldn't think hours in a bus just going a little way along the coast would be possible. However I will add I am so over a number of things:  * Van Morrison * Bob Marley * Smokers spoiling my airspace * Roads with tight windy bends every 100m for over 40km at a time * My joints playing up  Oh and seeing signs all over the island in front of opium poppy farms saying "WARNING! Trespassers prosecuted. Illegal use of crops may cause death." is quite amusing.  This is being written from a dodgy Net terminal in Hobart, and I'm out of cash. Bye. :)

      Not much to update so I'll do it all in one post. By the way, I stayed at  urlLink Miami Motor Inn  during my stay in Melbourne - close to the city, convenient to public transport, and probably the best consistent service standard I've seen anywhere in a motel. I've been there three times now and have sent friends there, without any complaints.  Friday - Went to Mornington Peninsula (a southern coastal extension of the Melbourne metropolitan area) via Frankston. Frankston is psycho city central :) Basically mix retirement village type scene with lots of young unemployed people and a few families thrown into the mix, with narrow streets and lots of cars. End result? The old people hold everyone else up and there's a lot of aggro and horns honking :P It was funny to watch but I wouldn't want to live there.   urlLink  Photo 1   - Wells Street, Frankston.  urlLink  Photo 2   - Canal near Nepean Highway, Frankston.  This visit was more of a "get to see and know the area so when I come next time I know which are the good bits". The original plan had been to visit Rosebud because I once knew of someone from there, but it turned out to be quite ordinary - just a big shopping centre. A surprisingly high number of attractive people living there though :P The stopping points ended up being Dromana and Sorrento. Both nice places, got to walk around them a bit.    urlLink  Photo 3   - Dromana Beach.  urlLink  Photo 4   - Beach huts at Dromana Beach (you find these all along the Port Phillip Bay).  I wanted to do  urlLink Arthur's Seat  (a chairlift going right up a mountain) but I was literally 2 minutes too late by the time I got there. (EDIT: This chairlift  urlLink collapsed  in January 2003.) On coming back to Melbourne and after a sumptuous meal at the motel, I went down and saw Chris the busker (refer to entries from Dec 2001) - he recognised me immediately and he now seems to have a band - they look quite odd but sound amazingly good (they were doing Cat Stevens covers).  Yesterday I thought I was doing a tour of Melbourne and when I looked at my notes it turned out I was doing Phillip Island, where thousands of penguins run up the beach at sunset to their burrows every night. It was an APT tour, which was a bit dry for my liking although we had a good and knowledgeable driver. This time, I didn't get eaten alive at the koala conservation park, and the Seal Rocks exhibition centre I visited last year had been  urlLink destroyed by a tornado  3 months ago - it was kind of eerie going in there and just seeing the souvenir shop (pretty much as it was last year) with nothing behind it. At the actual penguin parade (which was better than last year's) I met a guide called Damon who I was able to ask for information. I think I'll do his tour next year - it sounds somewhat more fun than the one I was on :)  (Edit: I found an even better one in Dec 2003 -  urlLink Duck Truck Tours , run by a local company from Phillip Island, for $70.)  On coming back to Melbourne, the fun wasn't over. My friend Lucas had insisted on my doing the Lucas Tour of Melbourne (sadly without a webpage), and even a late start courtesy of the penguins didn't dampen his enthusiasm :P I wasn't really dressed for the occasion, but we saw plenty of pubs and cafes and I got to meet his housemate Carlos, who was a very friendly host. At some unearthly hour of the morning I returned back to my motel.  After breakfast this morning I basically walked around the city all day - I'm trying to lose the weight I've put on and have been living on the hotel breakfasts + fresh filtered water + sushi (which is available at O-Bento sushi bar in Melbourne Central for $2 per hand roll - so one *can* live on it affordably :)  Tomorrow I leave for Launceston. I'm not getting the whole odd "missing Melbourne" feeling I usually get at this point in its fullest strength because I will be back in just over a week. I wish I could spend a lot more time here.

      (Refer  urlLink here  for someone's photos. I hope to have my own up shortly.)  Day 6 can be summed up as Great Ocean Road in dreadful weather. After an initial good start at Tower Hill, a national park inside a volcano crater with all sorts of native wildlife (mostly koalas, emus and small cute birds) which is not on any of the tourist itineraries except Wayward's, the really bad weather kicked in. Most people (even the English amongst us) got sick of horizontal rainfall and high winds and decided to throw it in at Port Campbell, where we stopped for what ended up being a 1.5 hour lunch at the local pub. While the wind didn't abate, the rain did, and we got to see Loch Ard Gorge and the surrounding area, and the 12 Apostles. This time I took the western pathway before visiting the gorge (in 2001 I did the eastern pathway). Lots of magnificent scenery, made all the more impressive by the high winds stirring up the oceans. All I can say is no wonder it's nicknamed "The Shipwreck Coast". The 12 Apostles was just too much wind and package tourism for most of us to handle (a lot of people, tourist buses etc) and we only stayed there about 20 mins.   urlLink  Photo 1   - London Bridge  urlLink  Photo 2   - The Blowhole at Loch Ard  (Better photos to come when I can get them scanned...)  The better part of the trip was our visit to the Otway Ranges. In 2001 the AAT Kings/Gray Line tour driver literally speeded through this and there's something really unromantic about seeing dense eucalypt forests at 100km/h from a coach-style bus. Wayward took it slower and we stopped for a rainforest walk at a place called Mait's Rest, which has to be one of the highlights of this whole tour. Massive trees and creeks covered in vegetation with a density that is just freaky just has to be seen to be believed. Unfortunately, my poor little Kodak disposable had no chance whatsoever in the poor light conditions.  Now I hear you asking "rainforest? in Victoria, at 39°S?!" There's only 14km² of it in the Otway Ranges, but it is there. It's a cool, temperate rainforest and meets all of the criteria needed to describe rainforests.  We stopped at Apollo Bay overnight. From this point on, I think it hit most of us that we were in our last 17 hours together, and between collaborating to buy group dinner, playing pool, listening to Dutch and Croatian music and talking about relatively normal "home" things like work and families and stuff kind of did bring us closer together. My motel for the night,  urlLink Coastal Motel , was right on the coast, and had a sliding door leading out to it - all very nice :) I made sure I got to savour and enjoy the room this time.  We left Apollo Bay at 7:30am this morning. It was pelting with rain both there and the whole drive winding tightly around the twists and turns of the Great Ocean Road until we got to Lorne - having seen it in fine weather in 2001, it gave a bit of contrast for me, I guess. At Anglesea we stopped at a golf course and pissed off a load of golfers while acting like typical tourists and photographing kangaroos which were all over the place (including on and next to the holes). On the bus we did a massive email exchange project so we all have each others' email addresses, and at Bells Beach, a famous surfing beach near Torquay where events are regularly held, we stopped for a group photo.   urlLink  Photo 1   - Kangaroos at Anglesea Golf Course  urlLink  Photo 2   - The sign greeting visitors to the Great Ocean Road.  urlLink  Photo 3   - Bells Beach.  urlLink  Photo 4   - Melbourne from the bus, 10 minutes before arrival.  Arriving in Melbourne was both sad and happy - I am quite tired after 4 days of full on activity and am welcoming the solitude of getting around by myself in a big yet friendly city (any of you who have heard me talk about Melbourne know how much I like the place) but at the same time it meant parting with the group who had become my friends. The goodbyes weren't tearful, but they were emotional and warm.   urlLink  Photo 5   - First shot in Melbourne, on Latrobe Street facing west.  And that's where I'll stop. This afternoon has just been a big unwind and would sound extremely boring on paper. :P

      (Someone else did this tour a week after me and  urlLink posted all their photos online . Worth a look.)  After my sunrise on the balcony and mad photographing mission was complete, we were off to our next destination. But first we walked around the Canunda National Park near Beachport with some very stunning scenery. This was our first taste of the Great Ocean Road I guess, although we had a full day yet until we would get to it.  Next major stop was Mt Gambier, population 23,000 - I was expecting a small regional town, but it was as bad as any city traffic-wise - absolutely nuts and several of our party nearly got hit several times in the main streets. I managed to find some nice fresh bananas and send a postcard home before we went off to look at the Blue Lake south of the town. This lake *is* really blue. Apparently it's got something to do with the way it was formed from volcanic ash, but it looks quite trippy in real life.  (EDIT: I came back to Mount Gambier and spent 2 days there in late November 2003 - see entries from that period for more information.)  After that we went to Donovans, a border town, for a picnic lunch (which was truly sumptuous, but I seemed to be the only person going for the beans and lentils!) and then crossed the SA/VIC border (at which point we all changed our clocks forward half an hour and photographed the signs just so we could say we'd done it :P )  It was quite a while until our first stop - Cape Bridgewater, near Portland, where an optional tour was available to see the seals in their native environment. I was already starting to feel muscle pains and fatigue from all the activity (which did include that long walk to West Terrace in Adelaide where I posted from on early Monday morning) but I convinced myself I'd only get this opportunity to go. So 8 of us headed off on what turned out to be a very arduous walk over some of the highest coastal cliffs in Australia (about 1.5km of them to be exact) to get to the jetty where the boat left from. We went out at quite high speed into the ocean and round some more cliffs to get to the seal colony.  I'd always imagined seals being pretty relaxed creatures, but after seeing them up close I've figured out they spend most of their time fighting and arguing and the rest playing in the water. We went into a cave and got some pretty cool views of seals just sitting there watching us - a couple even lunged for our little boat :) Eventually it was time to head back and we did so. However, once nearly back at the jetty, the guy driving the boat put it in full gear and drove it in circles. Unfortunately for me a wave came through on my side at the same time and I found myself fully clothed and completely underwater for several seconds. It took a while to rescue me, and when we did, several things that had been in my pocket (disposable camera, credit cards etc) had drifted away and/or sunk (and that's not to speak of the fact I was soaked through)  I think the guy (who was only about 21-22) panicked a bit and decided to take me back to the beach in the boat. The next 45 minutes were spent changing into new clothes, attempting to manually dry my old ones, while the entire bus waited for the owner of the boat company to dive for (and successfully retrieve) my credit cards.  We got into Port Fairy at 7pm, that little action drama over ... but my evening in what was really quite a nice town indeed was mostly spent washing and drying waterlogged clothing, eating in an overpriced and unfriendly Chinese restaurant (Four Seasons) and suffering from temporary back pain. The room was nice and I'm now regretting the fact I really didn't have the chance to lay back and enjoy it. But it's life ... and the whole situation did seem to provide amusement for most people on the bus (although they were also sympathetic and gave me good advice with relation to drying out the clothing).

      Well, I'm in Melbourne, after 3.5 days on the road. It's been a very fun and interesting time in a way I didn't necessarily expect. I'm not even going to try and explain it - it's something you have to go on a tour with a small group of people (in this case 17 others) to appreciate. You feel like you have connected with a bunch of people over a range of shared experiences, even though you'll probably never see them again and so are more free to be yourself. It was made more interesting by the fact that not one of the other people was Australian, and I spent most of the time with about 3 of the group who spoke only very little English, but who I was able to meaningfully communicate with.  The range of ethnicities was German (2), Swiss (1), Dutch (1), Italian (1), Slovenian (1), French (1), Colombian (2), US (3), Canadian (1) and English (3) - and me, the lone Aussie apart from the tour driver.  We left Adelaide at 8:15am on Monday (CDT = GMT+10.5h, WST+2.5h) aboard  urlLink Wayward Bus  and headed off into the hills. First stop was  urlLink Hahndorf , a town settled in 1839 by German Lutherans escaping religious persecution in their homeland, and the town still maintains a lot of its German character. I ate at the  urlLink 1839 Cafe  and ordered a "big breakfast" as on the menu. The surprise, I guess, was that they weren't at all kidding. It was big. With bacon, eggs, salad, bits of fruit, toast and all sorts of other interesting goodies behind me, we set off into the Adelaide Hills and beyond. I concluded that most of the south-eastern bit of South Australia is almost as boring as the Wheatbelt of WA - just flat farmland as far as the eye can see for the most part.  The exceptions, however, were glaring. The Murray River was pretty impressive - we had to cross it in a car ferry.    urlLink  Photo 1   - Wellington, SA.  urlLink  Photo 2   - Looking east from the ferry.  urlLink  Photo 3   - Looking west from the ferry.  And the  urlLink Coorong  was stunning - for those who don't know, the Coorong is a mixed salt and fresh water lake about 80km long and only about 2-3km wide, sourced from both the ocean and the Murray. We stopped at a wilderness lodge run by the Ngarrinjiri Aboriginal people, who have been revegetating formerly useless sheep grazing land back to what it was originally. We ate kangaroo and local fish and had a tour of the area from an Aboriginal guide who  urlLink showed us  some of the natural food and medicines the Aboriginals have through history lived on. I won't debate the guy - his cure for mozzie bites does work, as most of us concluded at some point or other during our trip. And some of the edible plants found as far east as Lorne, VIC, served me well the following year in emergencies.   urlLink  Photo 4   - 90 Mile Beach, Coorong Peninsula.  The next surprise came when we hit the town of Kingston SE -  urlLink Larry the lobster  :) An 18m high lobster outside a shop in the town was the centrepiece of all manner of photographs - unfortunately the shop itself didn't really live up to expectations (they don't believe in change, and overcharged me a dollar for an icecream...) Marine Parade in Kingston SE reminded me a lot of Bunbury for some reason, but it was very nice.  Anyway, at about 7pmish we arrived at a town called Beachport - population 407 - about 400km SE of Adelaide, 80km W of Mt Gambier, and had dinner at our accommodation, Bompa's by the Sea. The "Fisherman's Catch" was quite an interesting (and large) meal and I rather enjoyed it. (This is coming from someone who normally doesn't like fish or seafood, too...)  Despite its size, there was a lot to do on foot, although I seemed to be the only person actually willing to do it. A map of Beachport led to me discovering the Pool of Siloam which is 7 times saltier than the ocean, a Scenic Drive which hugs the coast at some altitude, a jagged and cliffy west coast and a smooth east coast with a nice beach and an 800m long jetty, one of the longest in Australia (the longest is in Busselton WA, incidentally, and is 2km long - I walked it last time I was there in 1998) Getting lost in pitch black climbing up steep hills through bush and falling into brambles wasn't totally fun though, and I came back with an intended mission the following morning to photograph the better bits of what I'd seen (complete with a shortened and bramble-free path to get there). I did just that.  The accommodation was amazingly good. I guess my expectation of backpacker accommodation in small towns was something of a "room with a view" over the top of the pub. While this was in fact entirely correct, it wasn't entirely accurate - the room was quiet, very stylish, and very large - the bathroom has to be the largest I've ever seen in any hotel or motel I've stayed at. I'd gotten a few bites during the day and enjoyed a nice bath before bed :)   (Note about photos - Any separately marked, numbered photos are my own. Any others are scammed off the Web - a couple were from someone's collection taken exactly one week after I was there! I hope to replace these links soon, but I don't have a scanner.)

      After leaving the cafe, I weaved my way around the streets of the city, taking photos on my Kodak disposable (Hosting courtesy of Webshots:)   urlLink  Photo 1.   North Terrace, facing east, from Morphett Street bridge.  urlLink  Photo 2.   Victoria Square, in the centre of Adelaide.  urlLink  Photo 3.   Light Square - final resting place of Adelaide's founder Colonel William Light. ( urlLink More info  about the statue and a closeup of it)  urlLink  Photo 4.   Eastern Parklands near my motel.  urlLink  Photo 5.   SA Museum, in a historic building in North Terrace.  I also had plenty of chances to observe the near-psychotic behaviour of its drivers and noticing a few unusual things about Adelaide:  1. They have very weird pronunciations for many of their streets and suburbs which are anything but obvious. 2. Adelaide is not pedestrian friendly - you have to go in whatever way the green lights take you and hope you'll eventually reach your destination intact. 3. The city centre and suburbs are two different beasts. The city (although eerily quiet at nights) is quite busy at most times of the day - especially that part of the northern half within about 200m of King William (the central N-S route) and Pulteney Streets (the one east of KW). The suburbs meanwhile maintain a slow and somewhat laidback demeanour.  Let's say the evening was interesting and leave it right there. Although the ending was good - I went to a coffee house called Spatt's on King William Road (bit south of the city) with Andrew, who had been there a number of times before. It was very ambient and intimate and very unlike any other cafe I'd been to - he tried a Gold Wasser which smelled like aftershave, was very potent and had actual little bits of gold leaf in it, and I had a chocolate crunch (kind of like a milkshake with class :P )  On Sunday I walked straight into a picnic in the eastern parklands (Adelaide city centre is completely enveloped by parklands) which all looked very happy and fun, and then wound through the streets again and checked out the State Library (which was in effect a single room with a very dark finish) before meeting up with Andrew. His parents were very sweet and made dinner for me - I don't think they or I wanted me to leave as we were having a very good conversation, but we were to meet a friend of Andrew's who I've gotten to know over ICQ and is very nice. He was as nice in person as I'd thought he would be and it wrapped up an interesting night (we ended up going to Spatt's again :).  Except that I couldn't sleep so I ended up walking all the way to West Terrace (about 6km from the motel) and am now sitting in a net cafe there at 2:40am. :P  So concludes another entry - Tomorrow I leave Adelaide bound for Melbourne, the long way. Don't quite know where we'll go but it should all be nice.

      On 6 December 2002 I arrived at the bottom of Arthur's Seat on the Mornington Peninsula south of Melbourne, after walking from one of the Dromana stops on Nepean Highway, to get the chairlift ... and was 2 minutes too late to go on it, it had closed for the day. Unperturbed, I followed the line underneath the chairlift across the road, stood up alongside a large pylon and took a photo. When I get home I'll scan this photo in and post it here.  And on today's news... I'll let it  urlLink speak for itself  actually. Note this appeared as one of the only two Australian stories on the BBC today.  The pylon that collapsed, if the info the news has contained so far is correct, was the one I was standing against, and the bit of road was the same one I crossed.  I think sometimes the universe just steps in to keep us safe. Who really knows?

      We've been getting some really nice weather in Perth, so on Saturday, Steven and I went around the southern suburbs  urlLink photographing  some nice spots - South Perth foreshore, Narrows Bridge, Mt Henry Bridge, etc on a disposable camera left over from my last interstate trip... One real surprise (shock?) was going back to the place I lived in for my first 3 months in Australia, which I do have fond memories of. What used to be known as Noalimba Migrant Centre in Bateman (which later became a temporary home for visiting athletes and conference centre) has now (as of Oct 2002) been simply abandoned - it was a good facility and it seems almost a tragedy to see it so rundown.  On Sunday morning, I went for a big long walk to North Beach (the suburb, not the beach itself) and Star Swamp Reserve. On a beautiful fine morning, I can't think of a better place to go at sunrise... Considering they're probably able to be considered as borderline inner suburban, one is a village with associated ambience (and a happening cafe culture at 8am on a Sunday!) and the other is a misty eucalypt forest. The only downside of said big long walk is that I have a burst blister on my big toe, making the likelihood of any walking in the next few days rather low...   In brighter news...   Following the successful annual tradition of traipsing around south-eastern Australia for a number of weeks in early-mid December, I'm officially doing it all again! :)    1/12/01 - 16/12/01      (1-5)   Adelaide     (6-10)  Melbourne     (10-16) Canberra   29/11/02 - 20/12/02      (29-1)  Adelaide     (2-4)   Wayward ADL-MEL coastal tour     (5-9)   Melbourne     (10-16) Tasmania     (17-19) Melbourne   My 2003 holiday continues the eclectic trend of the last one. In fact, it's slightly more eclectic, because the last one didn't have contingencies on it like "if this company goes out of business, here's plan B, and just to be sure, plan C."   27/11/03 or 28/11/03  - Leave Perth for Adelaide. This will be booked after my exams are more certain, as a 27/11 exam will mean my time in Adelaide will be reduced to a mere airport stopover.   28/11/03 7:40pm  - Arrive in Mt Gambier, South Australia, aboard an airline that calls itself  urlLink "Rex" . It's a thriving town of 25,000 whose major attractions are a blue lake (as in, REALLY blue), caves and ex-volcanic mountains, and the highest motor vehicle accident rate in Australia.   30/11/03 or 1/12/03  - Leave Mt Gambier. How exactly I get to Apollo Bay is anyone's guess (the company who originally was to do this is having some, ahem, "troubles"), but it's beginning to look like a 3am departure time by  urlLink public transport . There is, however, the option of spending 3 times as much and repeating part of last year's Wayward trip.   1/12/03  - Arrive in Apollo Bay, VIC, 200km SW of Melbourne, and spend a couple of days there. Nice coastal town, the sort with a population of 1,000 but teeming with tourists that seems to exist about that distance from any major city anywhere you go :)   3/12/03  - Experience the virtues and vices of Victorian (the place, not the times) public transport and arrive in Melbourne at my  urlLink friendly, affordable hotel/motel , the Miami.   10/12/03  - Hit the water on the  urlLink Spirit of Tasmania  luxury ferry for an overnight trip across the Bass Strait to Devonport, en route to Launceston.   11/12/03  - Bed down at the North Lodge Motel and start exploring Tasmania with my 7-day travel pass (haven't decided on which company will get my business for that yet). For the non-car-enabled like myself, Tasmania is probably the least friendly state for non-urban travel - it's inexpensive to travel, but there's only like one or two services a day each way even on major routes. But it's such a nice place that I consider it to be worth the trouble :P   16/12/03  - Return to Melbourne by the more commonly accepted method of air travel - my first flight since November :P It almost seems not worth it for a 45-minute flight.   19/12/03  - Thanks to Virgin putting on more convenient routes, I depart Melbourne for home at a slightly later time of the morning (last time it was a 7:10am flight - keeping in mind Melb is 3 hours ahead, it was 8:30am when I arrived in Perth and I still had a whole day to go!)

      After nearly a week, I've booked most of my accommodation and resolved  a near nightmare in one part of my itinerary and turned it into  something quite nice :)  Atlantic Canada was starting to turn  into a major headache. My initial choice would have resulted in seeing  almost nothing, doing long-haul bus journeys and exiting quickly. From  everything I've read, this would not do justice to the region, even if  it is so hard to get to and there's only one bus a day between some  places and they don't connect.  However, with two days' hard  work, I've found a way to do it that involves a lot of small, pleasant  towns, B&amp;B establishments and fairly short bus journeys and even a  bit of time on the water. I still wonder how on earth people went on  holiday before the Net came about - maybe they were lazy and went  through travel agents or tour companies. :P   (Note: C$1 = A$1.10)   Day 1  Arrive Halifax by air 3pm Arrange US currency/travel docs   Day 2  1:30pm Halifax -> 3:00pm Wolfville, NS (C$16, Acadian/SMT) 8:10pm Wolfville -> 10:35pm Digby, NS (C$23, Acadian/SMT) Stay at B&amp;B in Digby, NS (3 options)   Day 3  Spend day in Digby 4:30pm Digby, NS -> 7:30pm Saint John, NB (C$20, Bay Ferry) Stay at B&amp;B in Saint John (5 options, 3 budget)   Day 4  9:45pm (5:40pm) Saint John -> 11:15am (7:10pm) Fredericton (C$20, Acadian/SMT) Stay at HI/YHA in Fredericton (621 Churchill Row, ~C$16)   Day 5  11:30am Fredericton -> 5:40pm* Bangor, ME ($39, Acadian/SMT) - Set watch back one hour - Cross US border  6:15pm Bangor -> 8:45pm Portland, ME (US$20, Vermont Transit) Stay at Inn @ St John (939 Congress St, Portland) 2 nights   Day 7  Portland -> Boston, MA (Greyhound)   End sub-trip

      For those who haven't heard from me in the past 2 weeks or so, I've been planning a round-the-world trip and now the flights have been paid for. It's one of those things that came about almost purely on impulse - but I'm glad I've had something to get me through my recent illness. I'm sick of being sick, so to speak. Oh, and my parents having no life, and being stuck in a house with them. *sigh*  This holiday has been planned in typical Andrew fashion - i.e. it's madcap, busy and independent. Probably the main difference between this and other holidays I've had is the budget factor - I normally value my comfort quite highly, but this time, for the most part, it's budget accommodation all the way.  The basic plan is:  14/04/2004 - 22/05/2004 - Canada 22/05/2004 - 02/06/2004 - United States (north-east) 03/06/2004 - 06/06/2004 - Northern Ireland 07/06/2004 - 08/06/2004 - England (Liverpool, Manchester) 09/06/2004 - 12/06/2004 - Singapore  The eastern states trip at the end of the year (Mt Gambier, Apollo Bay, Melbourne, Launceston, Melbourne) is still going ahead. So my budget will look terrible come mid-next year :)  Anyway, back to being sick and bored. Oh and if you're a local of one of the above areas or have been there, feel free to provide any advice you think could be helpful to me - it will be appreciated. :)

      Found out George are playing in Melbourne (2nd Dec) before they come to Perth, so a bit of jiggling my timetable around and I am seeing them live and only paying the actual ticket cost itself as extra :P If you're in Perth, they're playing 6th Dec at Fly By Night, which btw is a non-smoking nightclub (yes, there is such things in Perth!) Ticket price for Melb is $35.80 including all fees so I expect it'd be the same here. More info:  urlLink http://www.george.net.au

      I'm currently at Cape Bridgewater, 17km W of Portland, Victoria.  Awoke at 3:48am and took advantage of the early hour to see some of Mt Gambier's main attractions by night. First to Cave Gardens which was beautifully lit up for the occasion. It really did need more colours though, I think - the lights were just lights, and mixed-colour lighting like that in Fraser Avenue, Kings Park (see  urlLink here  or  urlLink here ) back home in Perth).  On the way back up, I was called over by two intoxicated teenagers to adjudicate a dispute between them (which I did seemingly to almost everybody's satisfaction). I don't know why they always choose me for these kind of things! :P  At 4:50am - it is a 6km walk with some uphill through residential streets, a fact not entirely clear from the tourist guides - I finally arrived at Umpherston Sinkhole. This is basically a cave whose roof collapsed at some point and it's basically a big hole in the ground with a lot of vegetation growing at the bottom and up the sides as the volcanic rock is very fertile. I stayed there through sunrise and listened to the birds' morning chorus and the dragonflies while looking at the lush gardens and the odd possum. I bailed on the way back, though, and got a taxi.  It's sad leaving Mt Gambier. I like it, which is odd given my general distaste for the state capital, Adelaide. But I seem to have this thing for small regional cities (Launceston, Katoomba, Mt Gambier) - I'd never want to live in one as I like my city creature comforts too much, but they're great for holidays.  At 10:30am I left Mt Gambier aboard  urlLink Wayward Bus  on a beautiful fine day - 26°C and clear skies, a nice change from the oppressive humidity yesterday. We crossed the border and headed for Nelson, just 3km inside Victoria, where we had lunch. Shane, our driver, provided an excellent salad lunch which was all gone by the time we finished.  Then we were off to  urlLink Cape Bridgewater . I didn't go on the Seals by Sea boatride this time round (I ended up in the water last time!) and am enjoying an R&R break at the Beach Cafe, which sells unexpectedly good gourmet food, with a stunning cliff scenery backdrop.  I've feasted on smoked salmon sandwiches and pancakes/icecream/maple syrup, so I won't need dinner tonight. It's just 15°C here!

      What a long day! I've walked somewhere in the region of 23km today around Mt Gambier. Although the hiphop-blasting P-platers and their antics on the roads make walking here a hazard, I've really come to like this place and one day I will be back.  I spent the morning discovering the central city area and the Lady Nelson information centre. I guess it'd be of more use if I was either much older or much younger and/or had a car, but it was worth going.  The Jail YHA's shower was the next stop, followed by the long walk trail around the back of Valley Lake and Brownes Lake. Some spectacular scenery and great views of Mt Gambier and also got to talk with tourists from all over Australia, although quite an arduous walk!  Next was the much more famous Blue Lake - which turns a brilliant blue every November due to unknown volcanic factors (it is one of the handful of active volcanoes in Australia - apparently this region is the third-biggest and sixth most important volcanic region in the world). The fairly easy 3.6km circular walk around the top of it was excellent - I spent quite some time amusing myself with some tiny superb wrens which were about the length of my little finger and were busily hopping around looking for water and squeezing through holes in the wire mesh fence.  Returned to the YHA and talked to some Year 11s from Adelaide (450km away!) who'd come to compete in an athletics carnival. Also the owner, Gary, whose hyperactive dog Milka and its ball-fetching activities provided some cheap entertainment.  I'm exhausted.

      It cooled down alright - from 25° at 1am to 14° at 8am (although it felt colder). Was weird waking up in a real jail cell! I got my chance to wander around the grounds and take some photos before discovering the friendly local butcher.  I've just been to Cave Gardens (a vertical cave right in the middle of the city) and am using the local library's internet connection at the moment. It's still humid here, but I intend to check out the visitor centre and Blue Lake etc before day's end. I still can't get over how busy this place is for a city of its size.

      I'm in jail! I even have my own cell. Unlike past occupants, however, my only crime was to pay $30 a night for accommodation at  urlLink The Jail YHA  here in Mt Gambier. My twin cell, er, room has a functioning sink and toilet, and even a copy of the jail rules from when this place was a functioning jail up until the mid-1990s. Free self-serve breakfast and a local butcher 2 buildings away - what more could one ask for?  Mt Gambier itself has a population of 27,000 and is SA's 2nd or 3rd largest city, depending on who you believe. My observations of it so far are of a modern, well-serviced city with largely psychotic young drivers (reflected in its road toll, 9 times that of Adelaide in relative terms). Even at 9:30pm the main street, Commercial Street East, was still quite busy - the place was reminiscent of Rokeby Road in Subiaco. At 12:00am, the pubs were still going, as were the young motorists.  It's VERY humid here and I hope it cools down soon.

      Arrived Adelaide at 14:08 ACDT. Got stopped by quarantine because of my Chinese meal in a lunchbox, but the guy approved it and they moved on. The little dog was actually quite cute and not at all noisy.  Boarding of  urlLink Rex  ("Welcome to Regional Express, but you can call us Rex") flight ZL688 to Mt Gambier was an interesting experience. As per the flight to Canberra in Dec 2001 we got a small 42-seater plane with shiny propellers, and there was quite a bit of turbulence on it. We got amazing views of the  urlLink Coorong Peninsula  and massive radiata pine plantations west of Mt Gambier.

       28/11/03, 10:45 Nullarbor time (GMT+8.75) On Virgin 737-700 east of Esperance, WA.   The takeoff from Perth was pretty normal on a fine, beautiful Perth day aboard Virgin flight DJ354 to Adelaide. On this flight, one can buy, amongst other things, an autobiography of Richard Branson (described as "interesting and inspirational reading"), a Virgin Blue card deck or even a model of the plane - All this while gliding 10km above endless kilometres of salinity-addled farmland and cloud-covered ocean. (To be fair, though, WA's Wheatbelt region surrounding Perth is WAY greener than last year).  Forecast for Adelaide - 34°C (92°F) - Cloud/Late storms Forecast for Mt Gambier - 32°C (90°F) - Humid    28/11/03, 13:45 Central time (GMT+10.5)   Watching a lightning storm from about 8km above it is an odd experience, as is flying between clouds.

      15.25 hours to takeoff. I think it's when everyone at work suddenly turns all nice and starts wishing you happy holidays that it starts to sink in that you're actually about to go on a big adventure of sorts.  I'm foregoing the comfort factor a little (but not much) this time in favour of cost, just to see how I manage in time for Canada when I'll be spending practically all my time in YHAs and on the road. I've been on two annual holidays now - in 2001, I didn't really leave my comfort zone, and was in nice motels and at a friend's home. In 2002, I went on a few backpacker tours but still paid for the upgrade option.  In 2003 I'll spend the first 4 nights or so at YHAs and hostels and even get to sleep in a tent for a night, travel on a big boat and use public transport to get me and my stuff from A to B. In 2004 (Canada, US etc), only a total of 9 of the 60 days are *not* in hostel accommodation, and Greyhound and public transport feature even more than air travel. So there's sort of a pattern here.  Anyway, I fly tomorrow. An update on Saturday hopefully :)

      Last day of holiday today :/  There is really not very much to report at all. I've had a quiet few days in Melbourne, and am kind of glad to be going home, but I've had a great time as I always do.  I look forward to returning to some of these places and exploring new ones (such as the Grampian Mountains), and going to Canada in 2004.

      1. You may have the right of way, but don't assume side traffic actually knows this. They will assume you are not there and drive out anyway without looking. This applies even on foot, as people leaving shops act in the same fashion. Having 360° vision is a necessity.  2. Driving speeds are generally and widely ignored in Launceston, although speed cameras exist at some intersections.  3. When you see a sign in Launceston indicating a hill is steep, they really mean it. If a handrail is provided up a footpath and you can see the roofs of cars that are straight in front of you, these are also good indications. Howick Street in South Launceston and Duke Street in West Launceston are particularly worth noting, as they start off very moderate and then change suddenly.  4. Wear sunscreen. 15 mins in Launceston is like 45 mins in Perth, even though it's further south. I have no idea why, but everyone seems to know this down there.  5. Asking locals for directions is where the city suddenly becomes a small town again. People actually assume you know where the place is, or that it is not hard to navigate to, and give you directions that are anything but clear. Requests to clarify the instructions often reveal that the people don't actually know themselves. This phenomenon exhibits itself even worse in smaller towns.  6. Get to know where payphones are and always have 40c handy. If you get stuck and need a taxi, ringing the taxi number (131008/132227) from a mobile phone will get you a Hobart taxi, which is useless to you.  7. Once you leave Launceston suburban area (eg Perth, Longford), mobile coverage is non-existent. Keep this in mind when planning excursions.   An endnote   The locals are pretty friendly, and it doesn't hurt to talk to them. However, Launceston people see Hobart as the source of most of their woes, and the statistics even seem to bear this out - most major crimes committed in Launceston do in fact seem to be committed by Hobart suburbanites, and they are overrepresented in both the crash statistics and the road toll. Launceston does not see itself as the second city in Tasmania, and points out (again correctly) that Hobart is shrinking and Launceston is growing. It's also common of locals to overestimate the population of their city by up to 50%. Also, Launceston isn't quite as anti-mainland as Hobart is, but you're more tolerated if you come from Queensland or WA than the other states.

       Thursday 11 December  - Arrived in Launceston, which despite what a lot of mainland Australians think of it, is a great place, even if the pace is somewhat slower than, say, Melbourne or Perth. Like Mt Gambier, it's a city and a town at the same time and seems to have found the balance without turning it into a contradiction. Unlike most other cities, they haven't ripped up their heritage and so there's a lot of beautiful old buildings and houses to see there, and all with the backdrop of the hills and forests around Launceston and which intrude on its suburbs. I spent a while watching the Japanese snow monkeys in City Park (a park which is so green I have trouble explaining it to those back home) and admiring the 1932 John Hart Conservatory in the middle of the park which has both rainforest and alpine settings just metres apart. And I don't know many cities you can stay in a place (North Lodge Motel) twice the size of my last apartment with a complete kitchen for $60 a night.   Friday 12 December  - Got the Metro 80 ' urlLink Shopper Stopper ' around Launceston and explored its suburbs from the window of a bus. It was interesting seeing how much you miss when you just stay in the city centre - a mix of nice but rundown houses, stately English-style houses on Hobart Road (which used to be the main highway) and more modern houses in Prospect which reminded me of Perth suburbs like Padbury and Craigie. Later on I tried to walk up Invermay Road in the northern suburbs but driving rain prevented me from doing so. Invermay reminded me a bit of Adelaide.   Saturday 13 December  - Spent about 7 or 8 hours walking right around most of the 'Shopper Stopper' suburbs on a beautiful fine day, talked to heaps of locals, and had a great time with the camera (and my thigh muscles got plenty of exercise walking up suburban streets with 35-40° inclines!). However, I managed to get myself chronically sunburnt. The day sounds boring without the photos, so I won't elaborate further.   Sunday 14 December  - Walked around Invermay again, and then went on a Tigerline bus tour up the Tamar Valley. There was only three of us on it as it's low season (the high season starts just after Christmas), but I have to admit I was unimpressed with the lack of stops. We went through  urlLink Grindelwald , one of the area's major attractions, without actually stopping there, yet managed to stop at a vineyard down the road for 15 minutes. One big highlight was  urlLink Seahorse World  at Beauty Point, where we got to check out tonnes of seahorses, sea dragons, sea monkeys and other unusual creatures in both natural and artificial settings - it's an amazing lesson in a bit of nature you don't normally get to see and is well worth a visit. Then it was off to another winery (via the Batman Bridge, the only bridge across the 6km-wide Tamar River) before returning home. That evening was the Carols by Candlelight in City Park, and while initially enjoying the fact I could hear the entire thing with my doors and windows closed in my motel without having to pay to get in, it started to seriously annoy me when the doors rattled with the bass drum, so I ended up going for a late-night walk to Cataract Gorge to check out the floodlights.   Monday 15 December  - The late-night walk led to me sleeping at 1:00am, just after finding out about Saddam's capture from  urlLink ABC NewsRadio . Let us just say that waking up at 8:55am for a 9:30am bus departing 20 mins from you, while needing to have breakfast and get dressed and ready, is not a good start to a morning. However getting to Perth (the Tasmanian one), a peaceful country town of about 1,500 people just 20km from Launceston, was well worth it. I freely admit my main reason for wanting to go to the town was a curiosity to see what the other Perth was like. After amusing myself taking photos of the Perth Roadhouse and such things, I discovered the South Esk River and some really beautiful picnic spots. I ate and gathered supplies at the Perth Roadhouse before moving onto Highway B52 to walk to Longford, about 8km away by the route I took. Because of the savage sunburn I got on the 13th, I decided to wrap a towel around my head to cover my neck, and this evidently amused and/or shocked quite a few of the highwaygoers (I got a few toots from excited teenagers though). I later found out (after taking off the towel) that some Longford residents had reported to local shopkeepers that an Arab was walking along the highway.  I spent the afternoon on a  urlLink $35 cruise  (Afternoon Discovery) of the Tamar River in a ferry, which I'd strongly recommend to anyone, if not for the fantastic views, but for the interesting bits of history and trivia one finds out on the way. The story of Bruno, the large bull who somehow ended up living by himself on an island for 23 years, was quite entertaining. It's strange to think the founders of Melbourne, the pioneers of the Australian airline industry and the cousin of Alfred Nobel all came from this little region of the world.  My final view of Launceston wasn't that interesting, but this was my own fault. I'd prepared an itinerary for my parents' benefit and noted the air flights in Perth time. So at 8:30am I dutifully turned up to the airport ... 4 hours early for my flight. I spent the time with a pair of teenagers who'd missed the 6am flight, and at 2pm we were all happily in Melbourne, where I wrote this update from. :P

       9-10 December  - I departed Melbourne and walked all around Wilson's Promontory with  urlLink Bunyip Tours . It was a great tour and I saw a lot of amazing stuff, but I have to admit I jumped in the deep end and was ill-prepared - I spent most of the time trying to keep pace with 2/3 of the group and had to look down to avoid tripping over roots on the rocky terrain, so did not really get to see much of the forest and mountains and stunning backdrop - although I saw enough to be seriously impressed.  Furthermore, it was 32°C and approximately 90% humidity, with a minimum of 27°C - the sort of conditions for which there's never enough drinking water. This is *very* atypical weather for the region - more like North Queensland! Anyway, we slept in tents. Each of me and the non-English-speaking guy I shared it with insisted the other snored. So at the end of the trip I was absolutely exhausted, a bit sick, and seriously underslept.  On the upsides, we got to play beach cricket, saw a lot of wildlife after dark, and had a great organic dinner and got to hear the tour guide playing the didgeridoo.   10-11 December  - After a bit of drama getting to Port Melbourne by tram, and forgetting to get my ticket from check-in (the staff were very friendly though), I climbed aboard the  urlLink Spirit of Tasmania . This is not a boat, this is an experience! Imagine the Hyatt Hotel and your state capital's casino mixed together, and that's kind of like what it was like. The beds were comfortable and in rooms that actually reminded me of some motels I've been in. The restaurants were pretty good. If not for the amazing view off the sides, one wouldn't even know one was floating.  But if you wanted to be reminded, you could go outside and see the sea and experience a bit of spray and so on if you wished to. It's something I've got to do again - and intend to one day.

      I have fallen behind with the updates so here goes.   2 December  - I caught the  urlLink V-Line  (state-owned country rail and bus service)  urlLink to Melbourne  to see the spectacular Australian band  urlLink George  live in concert at  urlLink Federation Square  (a new complex which still manages to remind me of a failed university art project). When I get back to Perth I'll make a full posting about the concert, but it was absolutely awesome to see them again. They're one of those few bands I'd drop anything (or cut short a visit to Apollo Bay) to see. En route to Melbourne, we went through Geelong, which is much bigger and busier than I expected. I'll have to check it out at some point.  I stayed at the  urlLink Queensberry Hill YHA , which was like a large motel but with dorm beds instead of your standard motel room layout. It was extremely clean, and actually quite nice for an inner city hostel - I hope it preludes what I'm going to experience in Canada. Walking home from the concert provided the most amazing show of lightning (about 3 a second for about half an hour) - I later heard some eastern suburbs were completely flooded and it was the biggest storm Melbourne had had in 100 years.   3 December  - Moved into the  urlLink Miami Motor Inn  and found the same level of friendly customer service I'm accustomed to there after 3 visits in 3 years, but sadly suffered from a flu I'd caught somewhere in around Apollo Bay.   5 December  - Off to Phillip Island, about 130km SE of Melbourne and home of the famous  urlLink Penguin Parade , aboard  urlLink Duck Truck Tours , run by the  urlLink Amaroo YHA  on the island. This tour, for A$70, is one of the best I've ever been on anywhere and I would not hesitate to recommend it. I think the local, knowledgeable guides have a lot to do with it. We got to see a lot of wildlife (koalas, wombats, dingoes, penguins) up close during the course of the day and the group of people was also great. (After doing many tours, I can say for sure that the group you're with can really make or break the tour). I found out while on the tour that my proposal to line it up with the Wilson's Promontory tour was not going to happen as that tour had been cancelled, but I was able to book onto one on 9-10 December.   6 December  - I stayed overnight at Amaroo YHA after the penguin parade, and spent most of the morning walking around the township of Cowes and its beaches, which for a town of 3,000 is very well equipped to handle the millions of tourists it gets every year. I enjoyed some fresh treats from the bakery before returning to Melbourne.  Now I'd like a Melbournite to explain to me what is so amazing about St Kilda that everybody raves about it and insists I must see it. After spending an hour on Fitzroy Street, I concluded that it was a nice looking street with a tram line down the middle, lots of cafes on either side and a beach at the end of it. This is not unlike many areas in Melbourne, including one or two near where I am staying. Even the English backpackers I talked to, when I asked them, could only think to recommend its profusion of pubs.   8 December  - In what turned out to be a 36°C day (the weather predicted 23°C - not bad going!), I walked up  urlLink Lygon Street  in Carlton and right around the Royal Park/University areas north of the city. Lygon Street is somewhere I'll have to go back to one day to explore what it offers - plenty of cafes and a great range of them, but no tram line down the middle.

      I wrapped up Sunday with a visit to the mutton bird colony on Griffiths Island where I couldn't help being impressed with the birds as they swooped in from the ocean to find their burrows by the thousands.  Woke up to a breakfast of homemade pancakes courtesy of the driver, Shane, and then we headed off to check out Tower Hill wildlife reserve. Rule number one of running a tour like this - any unexpected wildlife WILL make the tour fall behind time. :P We saw quite a few koalas at Tower Hill, including a young one climbing down a tree, looking at our camera-laden busload of tourists with that kind of facial expression meaning "What the hell are you looking at?" It was quite amusing :)  Next stop, Allansdale cheese factory, where you can buy authentic Australian cheese. Then we turned onto the Great Ocean Road, which doesn't actually hit the ocean for its first 50km, but when it does so, it does so with style. As it was maxing at about 17°C temperature-wise, I was actually starting to come down with a bit of a cold, so I took it fairly easy around the attractions.  From here on, we did the standard Great Ocean Road thing - basically look at a very impressive bunch of big limestone rocks sticking out of the ocean in improbable ways and marvel and take lots of photos. In order, we visited Bay of Islands, Bay of Martyrs (or Massacre Bay), London Bridge (no longer a bridge), the town of Port Campbell, Loch Ard Gorge, the 12 Apostles and Gibson's Steps. We got surprisingly fine (although cold) weather for the entire afternoon so hopefully my photos will have turned out OK. I had the opportunity once again to meet heaps of interesting people at each of the attractions (and usually take their photo with their camera for them).  After a rainforest walk at Mait's Rest (as per last year), we stopped for the night at Apollo Bay. This was the point where I left the Wayward tour, having made a few new friends, and stayed at the  urlLink Apollo Bay Backpackers  - which was an excellent, very informal establishment with TV, internet and so much local information it wasn't funny. The room was clean and had a great view of rolling hills and the surrounding country-style houses. I had a nice shower in their well-maintained bathrooms.  My main complaint about Apollo Bay (which is a great town which I do intend to spend more time in later) is that once you leave the touristy bit on the front street (Great Ocean Road), the roads have no kerbs, no footpaths, no lights, and these crudely dug tunnels at the side of the road for drainage purposes which are easy to fall into at night. But it would be easy to live there for a while - surf culture rules the place.

      Settled into the backpacker accommodation - we have a dorm and shared accommodation. It's very clean compared to some backpacker type places I have seen. I'm going to explore the town as soon as the rain stops - it was originally called Belfast, is about as old as Melbourne, and is home to the world's biggest mutton bird (short-tailed shearwater) community.  (Added later:) I wrapped up Sunday with a visit to the mutton bird colony on Griffiths Island where I couldn't help being impressed with the birds as they swooped in from the ocean to find their burrows by the thousands. It was a very cold, rainy walk around the coast - if you ever plan to do this I hope you have better than suitable rain gear!  A pop-blaring van full of Israeli young people was my transport home. I owe them one. :)

       Monday 26 July 2004, CWST (GMT-7, Hawaii +3hrs, Perth -15hrs)   As we enjoyed a wonderful Air Canada breakfast, I got to chat with a guy from Victoria BC who explained some of the cultural nuances to me and some of the things I might come to expect in Canada. After a spectacular overview of Tofino, central Vancouver Island and finally Vancouver itself (which is, confusingly, neither the capital of British Columbia despite being Canada's third-largest city, nor is it on Vancouver Island), we landed. As we walked onto the gate, the guy from the plane said to me "Welcome to Canada". Some incredible First Nations wood carvings and a "Welcome to Vancouver/Bienvenue a Vancouver" sign later, I was at Canada Customs, which took literally 5 minutes before I was off looking for more spring water and the Airporter bus (C$12 one way) to get me to the city. The Airporter basically went straight up Granville Street and over the Granville Bridge, then wove and wound around the city dropping people off at hotels.  This is a beautiful city - well-maintained roads, lots of green around the place, trolley-buses running on electric cables overhead, two beautiful harbours - False Creek (south) and Burrard Inlet (north) - and mountains just behind the northern suburbs providing an amazing backdrop. For those not familiar with Vancouver's geography, the shape of the city (on the west coast of Canada) is not unlike an outstretched hand with the Vancouver CBD being the thumb and North/West Vancouver, Vancouver midtown, Richmond (and the airport) and White Rock being fingers. Each is separated by a river or waterway and there is some amazing bridges, including the Burrard and Granville bridges to the south, Annacis Bridge further south, Pattullo Bridge near New Westminster (about 8km SE and the former provincial capital), and of course the Lions Gate Bridge which crosses from Stanley Park to West Vancouver and is probably the most famous. Vancouver itself has 600,000 people and is one of the most densely populated areas in North America, but the Greater Vancouver region has 1.8 million. Not far away to the west is Vancouver Island, a mountainous island about 450km NW-SE x 100km wide, running parallel to the coast. The provincial capital, Victoria, a city of about 300,000, is on the south coast, and is 1.5 hours from Vancouver by ferry (which costs about $10). To the north and east of Vancouver are the Coast Mountains (the Rockies are another 600km inland). These mountains have spectacular peaks and lakes, hot springs, and Whistler and its ski slopes, about 100km north of Vancouver, which will be the the home of the 2010 Winter Olympics.  The Vancouver Downtown hostel is my accommodation for this 2-week stay, and it is definitely a much nicer place than I expected, and is centrally located, has full facilities, friendly staff, and is in a nice part of the prestigious West End district only 200-300m from the False Creek beaches. My only complaint is that the dorms are a bit stuffy so you wouldn't want to use them for much more than sleeping.  After walking around the city and getting my mobile prepaid SIM card (apparently a novelty in Canada) and a beautiful Persian meal for under C$12, and meeting my friend Daniel who was a large part of the reason why I came here, I ended up sleeping for most of the day, exhausted after 3 days with basically no meaningful sleep or good food.   Tuesday 27 July 2004, CWST (GMT-7)   Woke up just after midnight and walked up Davie Street looking for lunch. This is the heart of the gay district in town (evidenced by the pride flags on every - and I mean every - window) and I was amazed to find a range of supermarkets and cafes open. I ended up getting a tuna subway and water (I was still dehydrated from Hawaii!)  Came back to the hostel then went out again to explore the city. I saw the harbour by night, Granville Street (well and truly happening even at 3am) and spent part of the morning with two homeless people who were telling jokes to earn quarters from the public. (Canada has the same denominations and coin sizes as the US for 1c, 5c, 10c and 25c, but has a $1 coin shaped approximately like the Aus 50c coin, and a bimetallic $2 which looks really cool)  After we parted ways, I walked over the Granville Bridge and into the inner southern suburbs of Fairview and Kitsilano. Houses around here are really nice and elaborate, and the streets look quiet and well-landscaped. Saw in sunrise at Hadden Park, with some awesome views over the city, and then decided to go properly exploring on the SkyTrain. The SkyTrain is a Vancouver institution built for the 1986 World Expo, and more information can be found  urlLink here.  They're actually really cute (at least I think so :) - much smaller than Perth trains, but way more frequent as well.  Saw a green area on the map near Lougheed station in the Burnaby region so decided to get off and explore it. To get there, catch the Millennium line to Lougheed, then catch a 101 bus about 5 stops and get off on Cariboo Road, and walk down Avalon Avenue. About 400m later you should come to an info kiosk with brochures and information. Burnaby Lake took up the rest of my morning, with its flat walkways and stunning forest smells and views. It's weird seeing really green vegetation again - you see it in Tasmania and in some parts of Victoria, but Australia generally doesn't have deep greens, more blue/aqua and brownish greens.  Although I bushwalk whenever I can in Australia, I'd never been in a northern forest before and the trees are very different - generally quite straight trees such as conifers, maples, firs and oaks, with a lot of interesting ferns and other vegetation with names like red huckleberries, butterfly weed, policemen's helmets, etc. I do warn you, though - if you go there, there are plenty of mosquitos. I was unprepared, so got a few bites. Towards the end of the walk, I saw some Canada geese rather humorously arranged on a sports field almost as if they were going to play ball.  Found my exit onto Kensington Avenue and, together with a little guy from the Netherlands Antilles who asked me for directions, walked up to the nearest SkyTrain station. As I said before, one thing I love about travelling is the interesting people I get to meet.  Hungry and tired, I went on the prowl for food in central Vancouver, and soon discovered  urlLink Samba's Brazilian restaurant  on Burrard and Alberni. The way this place works - you have an all you can eat salad bar (with items like mushrooms cooked in wine, cauliflower, broccoli, chickpeas, caesar salads sans-bacon, etc) for $6.95, but if you want to, you pay an additional $6 and they give you a green card. While the green card (Sim! Por Favor with a bull on it) is up, the Brazilian meat chefs, looking somewhat like toreadors with their red napkins, cut off bits of meat from a skewer in front of you. When you're full (I was staggering out of the place), you turn the green card over to display a red card which says "I Give Up!" and a sad-looking bull on it. I have never been so full for $13 in my life before.  Not needing dinner, I continued my wanderings around the city, looking at the steam clock in Gastown (something of a tourist trap with myopic old people trying to hug the thing, etc) and then heading off to North Vancouver aboard the Seabus, part of Translink BC's public transport system. Came back to the hostel at sunset and met up with Daniel again, who has just moved into the hostel so I can see him a bit more.   Wednesday 28 July 2004, CWST (GMT-7)   Got up early and had breakfast at The Dish ($4.37 for a full breakfast - not bad! - discount with YHA/HI membership) on Davie St (Burrard/Thurlow), then went out to buy some DEET-containing mosquito repellent before going up to Stanley Park for a free tour (public transport charges apply to get there with the group though) with HI-Vancouver Central's expert guide Walter and about 15 others, most of whom were British and Australian. Stanley Park is a huge park which juts out on a peninsula into the ocean immediately north-west of the city centre - we spent about 3 hours amongst its rainforest trails and being educated on northern-style temperate rainforest ecology. It was a great opportunity for me to learn about some of the stuff I'd seen at Burnaby Lake, and if you're staying at either Downtown or Central this tour is pretty much a must given its short duration and its cost (or lack thereof).  After the tour I went into the city for a bit and did some more exploring (I've touched barely one-quarter of the city centre - it's huge!) before heading off to Pacific Central Station to buy my Greyhound tickets for later in my trip (you get a discount on some of them for buying in advance, and a 10% discount for YHA/HI membership). On the way back, I went to Chinatown and spent most of the evening at Dr Sun Yat-sen's Classical Chinese Garden and the adjoining Sun Yat-sen Park on Carrall Street with Daniel. This was the first Chinese garden of its type built outside China, and was completed just in time for the 1986 Expo with help from the Chinese government and 52 local artisans. The Chinese are very holistic in their approach to everything, and this Ming Dynasty styled garden, usually found in the houses of civil servants and town mayors and the like, was fascinating in its yin-yang contrasts and the fact that, despite being only 80m x 100m, there was design features which made it look much larger, such as an artificial mountain with a "ting" pagoda on it, sharp bends, Chinese/Japanese trees creatively placed to block views on one side and enhance them on the other, etc. It is free to enter the park, and $8.95 to enter the garden - and if you get in at the right time you get a free tour of the garden, which explains a lot of the subtleties you'd otherwise miss. It was a great experience to behold - a little oasis of calm in the middle of this very busy city.  Afterwards I walked back to the hostel, mostly to clean up my mosquito bites and get my newly-charged camera batteries before going off to watch the 10pm  urlLink fireworks  which had all but stopped the city with security and police from as early as 8pm. These fireworks are the first of four being held over two weeks, a kind of mini-Olympics for pyrotechnicians from China, Sweden and Spain to strut their stuff from English Bay on the southern coast of the city centre. Tonight it was China's turn, and they turned it on in style - I got to watch it from the beach down the bottom of Thurlow Street near my hostel. I did manage to take a video of a couple of mins of it (15mb, so dunno how I'll post it), but the above site has some good-quality stills.  Came back to Davie Street, got a kebab for $2.99 (yes, you heard right) in this awesome place called Casablanca that was playing Arabic techno music, and then found the cheap net cafe next door and downloaded my shots (from Hawaii and here) and movies.  This morning has been a bit boring to report, but I finally have time today to spend with Daniel rather than running off doing or exploring something. It'll be my only quiet day in the itinerary most probably - I have a heap of plans and you'll get to hear of them as I do the things on there. :)  Hope all my readers are doing well and I look forward to your feedback!

      With the whinging out of the way (on looking back, I was probably a bit harsh), I'm going to quickly summarise my last 29 hours in Hawaii, from where I left off.  20:00 Sat - Found good sushi at the 7/11 about 5 blocks from my hotel (the Ohana Maile Sky Court, the tallest hotel in Waikiki at 44 storeys) and then turned in for the night, watching a couple of US TV shows and chatting to my parents and friends before doing so.  Sun morning - Slept in so missed the Pearl Harbor tour I had booked and paid for. While I couldn't get a refund, the helpful lady downstairs informed me entry was actually free and I could get The Bus to it. After breakfast I did exactly that.  10:30 - Reached Pearl Harbor and entered the visitors centre. Was given a ticket for the 1:30pm boarding of the Arizona Memorial.  11:30 - Decided not to wait, but got some good shots and read all the displays in the visitors centre. It was quite stunning seeing the actual Japanese missile which downed the USS Arizona, the original anchor, reading about not just the story about what happened on the American side, and the personal stories and letters of many of those who died as well as survivors, but information from the Japanese side about how the attack was planned and coordinated. The place itself is quite scenic and it's horrifying to think such a beautiful spot was the site of over 1,100 deaths.  12:00 - Went back to Ala Moana, and checked out the Abercrombie & Fitch store. Although the last week has reduced my build a little, I sadly do not fit their XL t-shirt size and the XXL is way too big. The music and staff in this store are very young and hip - even compared to the Gap store next door - and it was one of the few places I encountered genuine friendliness (especially when the girls found out I was Australian). Walked around window-shopping for a while, went to a food supermarket and ended up with a (hard, non-juicy) nectarine, a lump of (stale) bread and a very nice blackcurrant mineral water. The  urlLink Vitamin Water  (click top right circle, then Vitamin Water, then a bottle down bottom to see the labels) had cute, silly labels that reminded me a lot of  urlLink Nudie juice  back home.  13:45 - Got the Route 52 Wahiawa Circle Route, which basically follows the Kamehameha (KAM-ay-ham-AY-ha) highway up the centre then along the North Shore and down the east coast. For information's sake (it confused the hell out of me until the driver explained it), the 52 and 55 are the same route but the 52 goes clockwise and the 55 goes anticlockwise.  The first part of the journey was a bit strange as an old black guy from Cincinnati who lives on the North Shore was trying to give us all rum, beer and peanuts and even weed, and he had a habit of talking very loudly. There was a couple of loud, middle-aged tourists in our section as well. After what seemed an eternity getting out the west side of Honolulu via Dillingham Blvd and the freeway, we passed over some very beautiful spots but I couldn't photograph them due to the bus's speed. The towns of Mililani and Wahiawa are pretty much urban residential, although looked nicer than Honolulu.  15:15 - Got out at the Dole Plantation. I was told this was a must-see, but when I got there it was full of tourbuses and very expensive merchandise. As I planned to be back in Honolulu by sunset (~7pm), I could only spend half an hour there, so didn't get to do the pineapple maze, but I did photograph some pineapples and some landscape shots nearby on the road.  15:45 - Onward to Haleiwa (which looked a lot like both Margaret River, WA and Lorne, VIC - surf towns for the non-Australian-initiated) and then to Waimea, which another tourist had told me was a must-see. This time, they were right about something. For probably the first time since arriving in Hawaii, I've found a place which is genuinely enjoyable and fascinating, split between the awesome surf beach on Waimea Bay and the river and rainforest starting very close inland and working outwards. I got some amazing shots - was an excellent way to wrap up my Hawaii trip.  17:45 - Left Waimea Bay, which had started to heat up quite suddenly, and we drove down the east coast of Oahu, which reminded me of the Great Ocean Road from Anglesea to Apollo Bay back home, except the vegetation was greener and lush and the path was neither as windy nor as hilly.  19:45 - Arrived back in Honolulu, bussed back to Waikiki and ate at the 7/11 again. I made a point of getting a 2L bottle of spring water as I was completely dehydrated.  20:35 - I arrived back at the hotel, where they let me use a courtesy room for 30 minutes to shower and go to the loo. From then until 22:30, I sat in the hotel lobby repacking my baggage, attending to my many and varied insect bites, and frantically trying to locate my Canadian currency which I appeared to have lost, but had just hidden rather too well as it turned out.  22:30 - Got the  urlLink Airport Island Shuttle  back to the airport. The airport is an amazingly open building with little airconditioning - a bit strange for a tourist resort with so much money. Considering how paranoid the US are about security, I was able to view my Air Canada plane as it was loading, with 10m and no glass whatsoever separating me from it. I finished the night talking to some other travellers from Australia and Canada and enjoying a Kauai icecream courtesy of the icecream bar, the only thing still open in the airport.  It is hard to explain, but as I was sitting on the plane waiting to take off, this feeling of intense happiness and excitement grabbed me. I was actually on a plane to Vancouver! I had been planning this for over a year, and now it is but hours away.  01:20 Mon 26th - Left Honolulu Airport aboard Air Canada flight AC034. We drove nearly 5km along various runways and the like before we finally took off - in the meantime having to endure the safety video in both English and French. I slept for the first part of the flight after watching CBC Inflight News.  **Note** About the times on my entries - the times I type in in bold are local times as indicated, but the time and date on the blog itself is ALWAYS GMT+8, i.e. Perth time. Sorry to any people this has confused.

       Sunday 23 July 2004, 19:30 Hawaii time (GMT-10)   (Edited 29/7/04, to take a bit of the 'sting' out of it)  Can someone please get me out of this island paradise?  I feel really bad saying this in a way, but I promised at the start that this would be an honest summary of how I feel about my holiday as well as just a summary of what I did, and to say I am enjoying myself would be wrong. This is a bit of a rant and rave, because I can't honestly see now why everyone rants and raves about Hawaii and the beach at Waikiki. Maybe I'm just trying to set the record straight, or just building a bridge and getting over it by writing about it so I can get on and enjoy the rest of my holiday. If I sound too whiney, don't worry, I'll be over it in a day or two :)   Eating and drinking  The 7-11 is the best place to eat in Waikiki. You can get fresh sushi (when they have it), cheap spring water and other goodies. Fresh food is hard to get elsewhere and is usually imported from the mainland, so is not fresh at all.  Restaurants - apart from the breakfast I have had each morning (which is still fried), most food here is expensive. Even Subway costs more here than back in Australia. They don't have Cadbury's chocolate, and the US alternative, Hersheys, just doesn't cut it - it honestly tastes like the cooking chocolate back home. Fast food is in. Deep fried is in. Fresh is out.  Sometimes I am forced to realise how lucky we have it.   Climate  Coming here in the middle of summer was not my brightest idea. It has been consistently hot and consistently humid. My health is suffering for it, as I've lost so much fluid and even drinking lots of water hasn't helped much. Also, in this sort of weather, your head goes a little bit, and I've lost my mobile phone twice (found it again both times) and my Oahu map (sadly didn't find it). The mozzies are having a field day with my legs - I've now got about 25 bites in different places - although I think they are biting at night in my hotel room.   People and Language  People here are Hawaiian - only the tourists are American. Quite a few Hawaiians don't speak very good English, yet work in jobs where they're basically expected to. This isn't their fault, but it still annoys me when I can't communicate with the person I'm trying to buy from. As for the Americans, they can't understand me either. I have to speak with an American accent sometimes in order to be understood. And that's not to mention all the language differences between US English and Australian/most of rest of world English that causes problems. (Note this is not a critique of Americans generally, more the middle-aged package tourist types who come to Hawaii dressed in wild shirts).  Also, in Hawaii, despite the above, it's very clear you're in a bit of America. The food is middle-class American, the language is American, the people possess very little understanding of any kind of world outside America (and, often, only their part of America), and I needn't labour the point as others have extensively. I get the feeling that some older Americans, most likely there on package tours their travel agent arranged for them, look down on me because I am Australian and get around in my own clothes and in my own way. With service people, I've had to put on an American accent at times as they don't understand me - even though Canadians, who have a similar accent, understand me clearly. I also have to speak in Fahrenheit and miles, which gets annoying after converting about 4 different things.

       Saturday 24 July 2004, 14:30 NZST (GMT+12)   Current view:  A nice, but very stationary, mountain and harbour outside my plane window.  I certainly hope that events like today's don't recur during my trip, although I guess there's almost a certainty they will at least once. I got up at 6am, had a lovely motel breakfast, then left at 8:20am aboard the Airbus. I arrived at 9:02am at the airport, got my boarding pass at 9:57am after a long queue.  I should add here that Auckland International Airport charges a NZ$25 departure tax per person which cannot be paid overseas or by a travel agent, and you can't depart without paying it. They put a sticker on the back of your boarding pass. Just as well I had $30 in my pocket :P  Anyway, the board said boarding at 11:05, which for a flight departing at 11:50, was fair enough. This then changed to 12:25, and then 13:05. By 13:05, the passengers were getting restless - and I'd bought myself an oversized thin-base pizza slice and a Diet Coke for prices not atypical of airports - and there was still no sign of anything happening. Several announcements apologised for delays, but gave no details. I phoned the taxi I'd arranged in Hawaii to let them know of the delay. Finally at 13:55, boarding commenced. 20 mins later, we were all ready to leave and the announcement was made that the captain was doing final documentation and we'd be given clearance for takeoff soon. However, that was not to be - the little loader loading our luggage onto the plane has apparently spilled fluid (water or oil? not sure) onto the tarmac and they reckon it will take 25 minutes to clean. Grr. It's a beautiful day outside, too.   Saturday 24 July 2004, 03:30 Hawaii time (GMT-10)   I am now in my hotel room in Hawaii sweating like anything. It is apparently 31°C at the moment (I'm getting used to all these Fahrenheit conversions).  The plane took off at 14:55. We had two really nice meals - chicken cordon bleu and calzone, each with salad, cheese and dessert - and watched three movies. My partner in crime for the 8.5 hour flight was Logan, a boy from Aspen, Colorado, who I exchanged info about Hawaii, NZ and Australia with. A flight of this length would be miserable without interesting company, and usually I've scored lucky on my national and international haulage. For movies, we got Hidalgo, 10 minutes of Mooseport dubbed into Japanese (ended by demand from passengers), 50 First Dates and Jersey Girl (again).  Arrival at US Customs took a while because of the queue but was both friendlier and easier than I expected. Walking outside, though, was an experience - from 13 in Auckland to 31 and humid in Honolulu in a jacket and trackpants (both necessary both in Auckland weather and for transporting small items safely) was quite a shock to the system. I'd got some insect bites in Auckland and these now really started to itch. My taxi arrived, but the security guy (who was apparently new) was hassling him over some registration issue, which turned out to be a non-issue, and I felt a bit caught in the middle. Honolulu's H1 freeway is a really nicely maintained road, and the driver seemed amused by my fascination with right-side driving and all the weird disappearing lanes.  My hotel in Waikiki is huge (and cheap, thanks to  urlLink PlacesToStay.com ) - 44 storeys in all. I'm paying about the same for this hotel room as you would for a decent Perth or Melbourne motel room. I arrived at 3:00am and after 10 minutes waiting, was sent to an 11th floor room that turned out (on one whiff) to be a smoking room. I came down and reminded them of my non-smoking stipulation on the booking, and got a 7th floor room which is really nice and is on a corner so has both a south and east view. Despite being only 3 blocks from the beach, though, there's that many skyscraper hotels here that you can't see beyond the next two or three.  I'm going to have a shower with aloe vera and aqueous cream, plug the bath while doing so, then have a nice relaxing bath before bed.   Saturday 24 July 2004, 18:50 Hawaii time   Sitting in a cool, airconditioned net cafe not that far from Waikiki - just returned from walking from Honolulu downtown. In order, the events of today:  4:00 - Bath. 4:45 - Abandoned plan to sleep and went out exploring the hotels of Waikiki looking for a decent map. Found a semi-decent one. 5:30 - Watched the sunrise on Waikiki Beach. 6:15 - Had a quick nasty breakfast for US$3.39 at a fast food outlet called  urlLink Jack In The Box  which, judging from the number of outlets here, is more popular here than McDonalds (I have yet to see a Burger King, and have seen one (1) KFC, near Ala Moana shops). 8:00 - Got a Hersheys bar, a Tootsie Roll and a decent map of Oahu at a small discount supermarket 3 blocks from my hotel. The roads are chronically dug up around here. 9:00 - After a walk around the Ala Wai Canal and neighbouring boulevard (reminds me of some of the riverside drives around inner Melbourne, and Riverside Drive in Perth), I had a proper breakfast at my hotel for just US$8, went to bed for a while.  13:00 - Woke up and walked to Ala Moana Shopping Centre. It is big, quite open, and not particularly well air-conditioned, but the shops are awesome. I checked out The Gap and Abercrombie & Fitch - and the food court is just enormous beyond belief. Saw a local band called Mixed Nutz playing live in the middle of the centre - they did a fantastic cover of Chevelle's "Send The Pain Below" as well as some of their own songs. I talked to some band members and their manager after the event, and even scored a free CD :D  They deserve to do well, I hope they do.15:20 - Got a bus to Honolulu Downtown. It's actually quite beautiful, if somewhat ignored - the place looked empty when I was there, and most things were closed. I took a few awesome photos - hope they work out! Had Subway for dinner - US$3.99. 16:20 - Started walking back to Waikiki. At present I'm about 9 blocks from it.  Couple of notes about this place:  1. The right-side driving is very confusing for me, as I've never been out of left-side drive countries. I've created a rule for checking that I'll try to keep in mind - Near Left, Far Right (it's exactly the opposite in Australia, where you'd first look right when crossing). At least with four words in a logical processing order, I should be able to survive the next 9 weeks :P  The weirdest thing for me was seeing cars turning left on roads with no median strip - it looked almost like the Melbourne hook turns until I realised it's just a mirror image of our own roads.  2. Money.   (a) I ALWAYS convert in my head back to AU$ to determine whether a deal is a good deal or not.  (b) They add 4% or so tax onto the displayed price - it's a great way of getting rid of cent change that builds up though.  (c) Change is exact here - they have 1c, 5c, 10c and 25c pieces, and $1, $5, $10, $20 and $100 notes: - 1c (One Cent) is copper and about the size of our (Aus/NZ) 5c. - 5c (One Nickel) is silver and a bit bigger. - 10c (One Dime) is silver and almost exactly the same size as the 1c. Confusing! - 25c (Quarter Dollar) is silver and slightly larger than our (Aus/NZ) 10c.  (d) Most things are sold by the pound. Multiply by 2.2 to get kg. Petrol is sold by the gallon - around here about 246c/gal seems about right. Aus$1/L ~= NZ$1.10/L ~= US$2.65/gal.  3. Newspapers cost about 50c here - far less than in Australia.  4. As in NZ where I observed Maori in most service occupations, here you see big Hawaiian dudes all over the place keeping the economy and security industry going. I had trouble initially telling Japanese and some of the Hawaiians apart, but I've learned how to tell the difference in facial features/eye shape - it is subtle.  Anyway, enough writing for now. I'm going to go watch the sunset.

       Friday 23 July, 10:47pm NZST   What a busy couple of days it's been! I'm writing this just before I go back to my B&B, sleep, and then leave for my plane. Last 12 hours in the Southern Hemisphere until October...  I couldn't sleep after finishing my last post on Wed night, so took a long walk at about 2am (Thursday morning) around the city, basically following Customs Street to the harbour bridge (which has no pedestrian access, sadly), up Jacob's Ladder (nowhere near as long as Perth's at Cliff Street or Burt Way, but still tiring nonetheless!) and back along Victoria Street. I was amazed at how many things in the city were still open. Ended up eating a quite diverse combination for $8 at an Arab kebab shop in Customs Street with some British backpackers.  Woke up late on Thursday, and had decided to go on a volcano tour of Auckland with a geologist at 1pm, so didn't do much other than get wet while trying to find food. I have, however, now acquired a sling bag! This has greatly assisted me in getting around.  The approximately four-hour tour, run by  urlLink Murray Baker of GeoTours , would have to be one of the best tours in value for money terms that I've ever had. I hope to get up some of my pics soon but there is some good ones and a review on  urlLink this page . Auckland's metropolitan area is literally built on a field of volcanoes, many of which are still in a technical sense active, and there's plenty to see - but it's easy to just see these things and entirely miss the significance of what they mean. It's also easy to forget that volcanos aren't just mountains with craters in them (although plenty exist and this tour took me to a fair few of them) - there are all kinds of craters and formations which are just as important.  I would highly recommend this tour to anyone , especially if you like being an independent traveller like myself and find yourself in a place where you can study up close the incredible power lying just underneath our earth's crust.  After the tour's conclusion I met up with Mark, who I also met on the net in 1994. Unlike Shannon, however, we haven't been in contact in the time in between, so it was a wide-scale catch-up. We have both spent considerable periods in the IT industry and had great fun trading stories about our experiences.  On the way home, I met a busker named James who plays acoustic guitar and sings across the road on Queen Street near Wellesley, just outside the Civic Theatre. First busker I'd come across in my time in Auckland - surprising as Melbourne, Perth and Sydney all have heaps - but he was seriously good. Any of us around at the time got to hear acoustic versions of RATM's "Killing In The Name", Metallica's "Wherever I May Roam", and songs by Pearl Jam, Sepultura, Simon & Garfunkel, Weezer, Incubus, and a range of others. After he was finished we walked back to Britomart and had a good chat.  One thing I have always loved about travelling is the opportunity to meet a range of people, and I've certainly done that here. Auckland is a very friendly and outgoing city, and I do hope to come here again soon - it's so easy to thanks to the new airlines opening up between Australia and NZ, and the fact NZ Immigration treats me like a local here.  Today was boring from the blog-report point of view - I wanted to get some information from the library while here, and spent some time doing that. Afterwards, I went up the Sky Tower, stopping on the way to watch some gravity-defying bungying on Albert Street. They had these two pylons mounted at about 80-100m with these straps coming down, and this ball thing which two people could sit in. It was psycho - especially in the middle of the city!  The Sky Tower observation area reminded me a great deal of the Rialto Towers in Melbourne. It was great - I'd waited for a clear day to do this, and was glad I did, as the views were fantastic. I got some great shots of One Tree Hill and the Devonport area. One slightly different thing the shape of the building allowed them to do was to put some small areas of glass flooring in at the edges. I do not recommend standing on these and looking down if your stomach is at all delicate.  After this, it was back to the B&B (Aspen House), where I socialised with some other travellers - some people from northern NSW and a guy from Florida - watched an episode of the Simpsons, and ate microwaved Watties vegies and the remains of a baguette I'd bought earlier at Foodtown - a fitting closing dinner to my Auckland experience.  Despite the traffic and the steep hills, I am going to miss this place when I fly away tomorrow. It's been an adventure and I've enjoyed nearly all of it. Honolulu, here I come...

      Following up from my successful (!?) guides to Sydney and Launceston, here's my tips for surviving the biggest city of our near neighbour.  1. Never assume anything with traffic. Be on watch always, particularly at five-way intersections where you can't even see two of the entrances because they're on a steep incline, don't jaywalk (it can get you killed), and in particular watch trucks. Three safe rules are:  i. If a truck is turning and looks like it'll end up rolling over you, it probably will. ii. If a car has a green light or arrow to go (this is often the case even when you have a green man), it probably will, even if it *should* stop for you. iii. If in doubt, run quickly enough that no car is likely to hit you.  (EDIT) How to manage at traffic lights - If you hear a long buzzing sound with the green man, just go anyway. This buzz means the light has stopped all traffic going in your direction. But be quick!  2. Food and water are safe here, but buy them from places where people speak English. Auckland has many Asian migrants who, due to the wholesale absorption of their culture, have never found a need to learn English. If an Asian shopkeeper asks you "Um wuh, huh?", it's sort of like "May I help you?" If you point at things, they will tell you what they cost, but they could be different to the marked price.  3. Learn to eat sushi and/or kebabs if you don't already. You will be hungry or out of pocket otherwise. :P

      Well, I've been here just 39 hours but it feels like a hell of a lot longer - mainly because I've been so busy! My impressions of Auckland are evolving as my experience does. At first, I felt completely lost and was wondering why on earth I'd come here. This wasn't helped by the bitterly cold, humid and overcast weather for most of yesterday. However, over the two days, I've seen a lot of amazing stuff and the weather has drastically improved. Oh, and I'd now recognise the Auckland skyline and in particular the Sky Tower if I saw it anywhere. The Sky Tower rather over-features in the photos I've taken. I hope to go up it sometime in the next couple of days.  Photos are still to come - I got them off my digital camera tonight, but am not able to do much with them until I can shrink them a bit and do some editing on them.   Wednesday 21 July, 10:30pm (NZST)   Since writing the last post, I wandered aimlessly around Auckland, assisted greatly once I acquired the Kiwi Minimap 2005 street directory for Auckland for just $15 at Dymocks. I've personally found it invaluable and it's still the cheapest directory I've seen anywhere. My only complaint is that the scale's a bit confusing - a few millimetres on the map is about 100m, so something that looks only a short distance ends up being a half hour walk. Still, I shouldn't complain - there's no question that my getting around is improving my fitness.  My wanderings ended me up at Karangahape Road (K Road to the locals), which apparently used to be a red light district but has become something of a Chinatown. My general observation of Auckland is that, unlike Australian cities which have absorbed and adapted European culture, Auckland has actually done the same with Asian and Polynesian culture. There is no shortage of sushi bars, Korean restaurants and kebab bazars - in fact, more of them than anything else, even in the more working-class areas.  Hearing somewhere that travelling extensively on public transport in the first day gives you more of an overview of a place, and feeling tired anyway, I decided to go to Otahuhu (even the locals disagree on pronunciation), a station in southeast Auckland which is on both the east and south train lines, by the east (scenic) line and return by the south (motorway) line. City centres are often quite sanitised places and this would give me an opportunity to see the suburbs.  This excursion led to at least two additions to my Survival Guide (see next entry) and exploring a working-class suburb. Think big containers piled up everywhere, and trucks that act as if the road laws do not exist. One thing I have observed about Auckland is that people are generally very friendly, and this place was no exception. I walked the Portage Road, a 0.9km road over which a group of Maori at some stage dragged their canoes from one waterway to another opposite.  On travelling back via train, we got stuck just out of Newmarket station as a signal was broken, and ended up waiting more than 30 minutes in total across 3 stops to get back to Britomart (the central station). I was somewhat concerned that no-one else seemed to think this was even odd or anything more than a minor inconvenience. I suspect that these sort of oddities are not unusual - it's a pity, considering they are actually really nice trains comparable with the Perth/Brisbane ones. The train stations, apart from the central ones, reminded me of country airstrips, with rocks sprayed on and a small concrete edifice sufficing as the platform. They were spectacularly badly located - the train journeys seemed to go through industrial areas rather than areas where people actually live, work and shop. Britomart, a nice, modern, multilevel station that reminds me of a couple in Melbourne, was completely empty when we arrived back. When I told several Aucklanders of my experience, I got quizzical looks and was asked why on earth I didn't use the bus.  Feeling a bit dispirited, I decided to try out the Auckland ferry system, apparently one of the best in the world. Auckland doesn't have a river - it has harbours, and many people work on one side and live on the other, and the Auckland Harbour Bridge kind of goes to a different bit (the Northern Motorway joins Northcote and Birkenhead with central Auckland - a bit hard if you live in Devonport, just 4km from Auckland but at least 15km from Birkenhead). For ferries that are just public transport, they were incredibly luxurious - the top level contained a bar selling soft drinks and potato chips and had two outside viewing areas, and the bottom level had a coke machine. They even had toilets! Not bad for a ferry where the average journey length is 10 minutes. My idea once arriving in Devonport was to catch a bus to Takapuna (a major urban centre in the North Shore) and see Lake Pupuke, which I'd heard somewhere on the net was good.  However, Auckland's weather stepped in to make sure this would not be. It started raining on the bus journey, and was so miserable by the time I reached Takapuna that I just ran across the road and caught the same bus back! From what little I saw though, I decided that I was definitely coming back on a better day to see it. It's amazing comparing Otahuhu with Devonport. The North Shore is a lot more like its equivalent in Sydney, or with the Stirling Highway suburbs in Perth (Mosman Park, Claremont, Nedlands). It is amazing to think just a week ago I walked from Claremont to Perth and did Jacob's Ladder - it already seems way longer than that. On the bus, I met a friendly local boy who chatted with me about music, Australia vs New Zealand, his acting and musical aspirations, and uni life. I think often it is easy to look at and see what is different and forget about what is basically the same.  A note about language here. NZ English is often stereotyped by Australians - my observation has been that while working-class and rural people do speak that way, it's a lot less noticeable in Auckland, the biggest Polynesian city in the world. In fact, some people here are very difficult to tell from Australians. Word-use wise, though, NZ English does differ in some ways - calling the central area (what we call 'town' or 'CBD') 'downtown', for example, or calling a mobile phone a 'cellphone' as Canadians and Americans do, but calling the freeway a motorway as the British do. We're still understood here if we speak our language though :)  Finished off the rather rainy evening by meeting my friend Shannon, who I first met on the net way back in 1994. We had a great time looking for somewhere to eat, eating and then driving around various regions of Auckland checking out the sights while trying not to get wet, and lots of catching up. Was great. :) Got back at 1am and went to bed pretty much straight away.  Slept in, unfortunately - two nights of almost no sleep followed by a busy day caught up with me. Hence I missed the B&B's breakfast menu, and ended up going to a nearby Foodtown to buy tempura and bread rolls, which I ate on the Devonport ferry while enjoying a spectacular view of Waitemata Harbour. The sushi counters at Auckland supermarkets actually sell real sushi that you see the sushi guy freshly making before your eyes - it's quite something. Foodtown (the retail arm of giant Foodland) is the only major supermarket after buying out rival Woolworths NZ (not related to the Australian one), although you see New World stores (are these ex-Coles New World? anyone know?) in a few places.  As for the rest of the day, I went to:  - North Head, a dormant volcano near Devonport which was formerly a navy defence post (as per most volcanoes in Auckland) and had active guns as recently as 1996. Was great fun climbing all over the place and down tunnels, and the views of Rangitoto Island (one of Auckland's dominant features) and the city and Mt Victoria were great. - Bayswater, a harbour suburb a bit further up, where houses sell for close to NZ$1 million. Like many suburbs of its kind, as referenced previously, the landscaping and house design is excessive, but the end result doesn't look bad. Despite this, as in many parts of Auckland, the roads are poorly maintained. - Takapuna, a small city in itself with some great Asian cafes, traffic snarls, a pretty cool shell beach, and, of course, Lake Pupuke. It was quite impressive and I ended up spending sunset there. I got chased away by an entire flock of birds, however, who decided that as I had no food, I was of no use to them. :P  Spent the evening talking to a few people who rang me (I have a prepaid number for NZ by the way - if you get a weird SMS from a number starting +6421036, it's probably it) and processing my photos and typing these entries at the net cafe.   Food, budget and other stuff   So far, I have spent NZ$199 in general expenses (about A$180, not including bank fees). This includes food, water, net cafes, souvenirs, the prepaid phone and calling cards, street directory, transport, and the Airbus. Some of these are one-off, the transport is a set cost, and the Airbus actually includes the return ticket. Identified ways of saving money include getting a "sling bag" which I can take out with me, which would allow me to take up to 2.4L of tap water on my journeys, as Auckland tap water is quite drinkable.   Food so far:   19 Jul - Dinner - Plane dinner 20 Jul - Breakfast - At the B&B 20 Jul - Lunch - Subway @ K Road 20 Jul - Dinner - Happy Hippo (Chinese pick-by-numbers in Wellesley Street) with Shannon 21 Jul - Lunch - Tempura and bread rolls from Foodtown supermarket 21 Jul - Dinner - Japanese meal at Mansun restaurant, Takapuna

       Tuesday 20 July, 1am (some timezone somewhere)  &nbsp; Now flying from Perth to Auckland aboard Air NZ flight NZ176 (departs 19:30, arrives 05:50). This is a 6hr 20min flight with a 4 hour timezone jump, and feels every bit of it. Various bits of me&nbsp;are already feeling dreadful. We are watching Laws of Attraction and Jersey Girl. I can't say I'd watch either if I had the choice, but they're not the worst I've seen on a trip (I think "Race the Sun" starring Corey Affleck, Ben's younger brother, on a bus from Bunbury to Perth in 1998 would be it - his acting was the saving grace, but the plot sucked!) &nbsp; A few notes about the last few days. On Sunday, Dad's car broke down chronically, which hampered things considerably. I basically had several things to take care of - buying a shaver (mine broke ages ago), banking a heap of money so I'd have accessible money on my trip, hassling Global Plus in Fitzgerald Street about my Belgrade-Istanbul ticket, renewing my YHA/HI membership and getting the vouchers for the Singapore Stopover package. I did all except the last in 45 minutes, and entirely on foot. I'm glad it was a beautiful fine day and I was fit. :P &nbsp; Dad got a loan car at the last minute (quite a nice one too) so we managed to get to the airport, albeit somewhat later than expected - only 1hr 15min before the plane left! Thankfully, everything was very routine - I was an Australian citizen going to New Zealand and had nothing to declare, and everyone was very friendly at the three or so desks I had to go through. I'm glad that I don't buy duty free in airports though. The flat trapezoid box of Lindt chocolates you can buy in any Target or Kmart store for $2.99 cost $5.30 tax free, the alcohol looked expensive, and I don't see anyone paying $125 for a heap of chocolate macadamia nuts, even if a "free" $30 cabin bag is included in the deal. &nbsp; The Air NZ plane was a little old/dilapidated, but still quite comfortable. I got a window seat and have seen an awesome skyline of Perth, a view over Hobart as we went over that, and some awesome stars on a clear sky. According to the information displayed on the monitors between the movies, we maintained an average altitude of 11,300m, the avg temperature outside was -53 deg C, and avg speed was 925 km/h. At takeoff, the speed was 327km/h. &nbsp; I tried to sleep on the plane, but not very successfully - I did get some sleep but I hope I get much more tonight to make up for it. &nbsp;  9:53am, NZST (5:53am Perth time)  &nbsp; I've arrived safely in Auckland - the adventure has well and truly started. Arrived on time at 5:50am - it was pitch black and 5C. After ages of going through one counter after another, I got my luggage almost immediately, then got the bus outside (NZ$22 return). &nbsp; Side note - New Zealand has really nice looking currency - if I get time and a suitable range of notes I'll try to get a picture of it. They have $1 and $2 coins like Australia do, but the $2 is about the size of&nbsp;our 20c coin, and they're made out of a lighter material. &nbsp; The bus took us up a pretty non-interesting motorway, then through the inner southern suburbs into the city centre, and then all around it. Auckland feels like an Australian city, yet just isn't for reasons that are hard to pin down. The roads look very similar, although some signs are different. Thing that hit me immediately is that Auckland is a lot more cosmopolitan than other cities that I've been to - most notably, I notice Maori in just about every service occupation here, and "sushi and sake" cafes everywhere. Fuel is more expensive (it is weird seeing 121.5 on a fuel station, but keep in mind to divide by 1.1 for the currency conversion). As for getting around, the city centre seems REALLY busy, and a disproportionate amount of it is built on completely unlikely hills. &nbsp; My accommodation, Aspen Lodge ($50 a night&nbsp;inc breakfast and shared facilities)&nbsp;is actually really nice. My stay in NZ definitely isn't going to be wanting in the comfort department :P &nbsp; This city is too hard to navigate without a street directory, so I've acquired one. Hopefully getting lost every time I leave Queen Street (the main drag in Auckland) won't be too hard. &nbsp; I'll update again in a few days.

      Sorry that this has taken so long to post - I've been a busy boy.  Tuesday was a very quiet day as the weather had 'turned'. I spent it mostly in the hostel, although I got out a bit around the city centre. I was supposed to go on a free hostel tour to UBC but it got cancelled - I ended up going to the UBC Museum of Anthropology - it's free on Tuesdays and I tacked on the back of a tour where I learned a lot about First Nations totem poles and the ideas that go into constructing them. The museum itself is awesome - they've got everything. Rogers have suddenly decided to stop accepting international (i.e. non-Canadian) credit cards so I now have to go to 7-11's and buy topup cards the manual way. Not fun, especially when you're trying to meet someone on a large campus and don't have any contact with them.  Wednesday was to be my last free day in Vancouver, so I went off with my camera on the Skytrain network, taking pictures of interesting bits of the network (Broadway-Nanaimo, Joyce-Patterson and 22nd St-New Westminster are the best bits). Went to New Westminster and checked out the quays there - would be better on a better day as I could have walked around more. Ended up coming straight back, cooking dinner, going to the net cafe and then going to see the Spain fireworks - they were awesome but I still thought China's was better as they kept up the momentum the whole way through and not just at the end.  Thursday was set aside for Whistler - however both Daniel and I proved totally unequal to the task of waking up at 7:00 - we managed closer to 10:00. Having missed the 11:00 Greyhound to Whistler, we wandered around the Cambie Bridge and eastern False Creek areas and took nifty pictures of Science World before enjoying a Jugo Juice (kind of like Java Juice) and then finally catching the 12:30. It takes about 2 hours to get to Whistler. The Whistler Village is all hype and no substance - it's basically a heap of expensive tourist oriented pubs and shops, but there is a free shuttle from the back to a walk trail called Lost Lake. It was nice getting into forest again and seeing lots of wildlife - I counted 5 things (including a couple of chipmunks, which were really cute) but couldn't identify most of them due to a lack of acquaintance with the wildlife up here. We were going to take the ski lift to Whistler Mountain (which was snow-free) but it cost $23, which seemed exorbitant to our tiny budgets ($31 return bus ticket, $23 per night accommodation, $7 for food etc) so we didn't do it. The view going back to Vancouver along Sea & Sky Highway was amazing - even better than Whistler in my opinion. It would probably be better to visit in March than in July/August though.  Friday was our Victoria day. We tried to wake up at 5:30am - again without success. We got out at 8am and Daniel wanted me to see the Queen Elizabeth Park. However, by the time we got there it was pelting with rain and we were sort of running between things and photographing gardens and then running to the next one. From the point we left there to the time we arrived in Victoria 137km away, it took us 7 hours.  9:20am - Boarded 15 (after 15 min wait) to end of Cambie St 10:08am - Boarded 100 (after 20 min wait in rain) to Airport Station 10:28am - Boarded 620 (after 10 min wait) to Tsawwassen ferry. It missed the on-the-hour ferry by just a few minutes. 12:00pm - Boarded ferry to Swartz Bay. 2:15pm - Poor visibility slowed us down so the normally 1.5 hour ferry took 2.25 hours. 2:30pm - Boarded 70 to Victoria. 3:55pm - Arrived in Victoria after seeing just about every street on the Saanich Peninsula.  I'd gotten into the sort of mood where I was just pissed off with everything and had no patience or motivation - Victoria was interesting but not that interesting, and very touristy. A lot of the "old charm" struck me as being for the tourists' benefit, and everywhere you looked or tried to go, hordes of people fresh off Pacific Coach Lines or Gray Line buses were blocking your way. Daniel and I retreated to the safety of Beacon Hill Park, some 500m south of downtown, which was indeed much nicer - forests, lakes, ducks and a rare (native) black squirrel which I actually managed to photograph (Daniel had been teasing me for days about my low hit rate for photographing wildlife).  After checking that out and walking along the beach on the south end of the park (which looked a bit like the far northern Perth suburbs if not for the offshore mountains in Washington state) we were exhausted and needed food and drink, and we ended up finding the Siam Thai restaurant in Fort Street near the harbour, which turned out to be surprisingly good.  We left at 7:30pm and I ended up talking to a family from Montreal who ended up giving me a lift back to Burrard Street from the ferry - which saved me time, money and hassle (Daniel was with friends by this point as he won't be seeing them for a few weeks).  On Saturday, it was Erik's City and Canyon Tour - a special one held to mark the grand finale of the HSBC Celebration of Light fireworks. This tour was thoroughly awesome - for just $9.99, we travelled on every mode of public transport, walked for over 9km in total in both city and forest environments, saw city landmarks and secrets, rainforests, waterways and even a couple of coffee shops, and had a great, very mixed group with a lively and interesting tour guide who clearly has a passion not only for Vancouver but for sharing his love and passion with anyone he can. Over 6,000 people have taken this tour since he started it 10 years ago after retiring. At the end we saw the grand finale - I'm not sure yet who won, but all three countries put on brilliant shows. After that, we went back to Erik's apartment and had icecream, talked and eventually said our goodbyes.  We were meant to go to Lake Louise on Sunday morning, but due to mishaps on both Daniel's part and mine (namely, leaving important items behind when leaving establishments) we were forced to delay by one day. More later...  (A better update will be provided when I have more time and am not so tired)

       Sunday 8th August 2004, Vancouver time (GMT-7, Perth-15)  This was the day that wasn't meant to be in Vancouver, but just as well it was - it probably ranks alongside Burnaby Lake as my best day in Vancouver, aided somewhat by the 28°C, fairly non-humid fine weather. Daniel took me to all his favourite spots around the City of Vancouver (I should explain that the City is just one part of Greater Vancouver and includes the downtown and a fair slab of land south and east from it).  Firstly, the grand tour of UBC, where I got to see a very nice campus that is twice the size of the downtown, and is actually a really nice place. Not too many campuses in the world that have their own rainforest - and a naturally-growing one at that. He took me down the perilously steep path to Wreck Beach, Vancouver's clothing-optional beach. It was an experience trying not to see exactly the sort of people you would never want to see naked flashing their bits at the world at large. I did manage to get some good photos though (not of the people, of the scenery.)  Then it was to Granville Island, which Daniel assured me was nothing special and was all hype, so we decided to eat at a sushi place just outside it that he sometimes goes to, then walk through the middle and catch the ferry at the end back to the city. This was all done in roughly that order - Granville Island was sort of like a cross between Fremantle and Sorrento Quay, but busier than both.  Then finally around the city itself and back out to Queen Elizabeth Park. He showed me his favourite view there and I got a picture from it. Some Swedish ladies saw us in the bushes and decided to join it, and after we left we enjoyed a bottle of delightfully expensive French lemonade which we got at 60% off in a bookshop.  Finally, we went to Trout Lake - we went separately as Daniel wanted me to meet Cass again before I left. We went to the lake but some sort of children's sports event was happening but we still had a great sunset there before returning by car to the city. It's funny how when you catch the bus all the time you just don't see a lot of the stuff out the windows yet you do when in a car.  Packing was of the essence, though, as we had to be at Pacific Central station at 6:30am, which meant waking up at 5am. (In the end this proved unachievable but for my mother who managed to get me woken up about 5:15am) - but not before downloading my pictures at the net cafe and visiting Casablanca Kebabs on Davie Street for one last time.  I realised I was really going to miss Vancouver. Four people who had lived elsewhere had talked to me about how they came to stay in Vancouver as it was the most beautiful city they had seen, and I knew Perth, Melbourne and Vancouver have repeatedly been rated most livable cities in the world, so I realised a high point was kind of over.  Reflecting on Vancouver after 2 weeks there, here are my observations. Vancouver is an excellent city with the best transport system I've seen anywhere, although I would hate to own a car here (although traffic is orderly here, it is very slow) or live in the City, as double-digit-floor apartment living just isn't me. There's plenty of green here and many attractive and colourful distractions from the lifestyle though, and the cafes provide cheap and fresh authentic food from all over the world. Vancouver reminds me a lot of Melbourne and is not unlike Auckland as well in some ways.  Canada has transformed the way I think about my own country, and I have no doubt when I see Eastern Europe and Turkey that I'll look back and say it was the first stage in a process. I have realised how good we do have it. I have realised that for all we complain about problems in our cities, with crime, traffic, etc, we really don't have problems in the way other countries - even this one - do. We need to work on race relations, and on reconciling with the Aboriginal people as a nation, and there's never too much that can be done to help reduce the gap between rich and poor and on trying to harm the environment less, but apart from that, we have done amazingly well in creating a country for people to live and work in peaceably. And we need to stop whinging and putting ourselves down.

       Peace Arch and Blaine  It is truly weird walking down the road to a land border and actually seeing all the weird contraptions set up to handle the thousands of motorists who cross this point every day, and also to look on beaches just a couple of km away and realise they're in a different country. Coming from Australia, where no other nation is visible, this is just bizarre.  The Peace Arch Provincial Park (BC) and Peace Arch State Park (Washington) span the border, and are basically a big green recreational area with forest on two sides, and the Peace Arch, a big white structure which one can actually walk through, in the middle next to the freeway, which has by this point been separated out and slowed down to 30km/h (or 20mph on the US side). The Peace Arch has several inscriptions on it like "Children of a Common Mother" and "Brothers Dwelling Together in Unity". On the inside is a gate (which couldn't serve any purpose as the entire space on both sides is open), jammed open, with the words "Let This Gate Never Be Closed" above it. Each year, there's a big get-together of kids from both sides for the purpose of engendering communication.  About 400m from it on each country's side is that country's customs and immigration centre, which has about 5 or 6 lanes for cars to pass through, and separate duty free areas for each. I noticed Canada's was far busier than the US's. Near them is a flower plantation made up of each country's flag, and not far from the Peace Arch are the actual survey points marking the border.  Now for...   My Adventure in the USA   I walked across the border marvelling at the structures, and followed the path to the US Customs, noting the instructions for pedestrians to go to the east side. I entered a small, functional room at 17:09 whose only welcoming words were that there were no, zero, zip restrooms. In this room was a counter, behind which sat many black-uniformed police and customs officials, and some seats. I was grilled first by a lady who insisted I leave all my bags on the counter, took my passport and told me to sit down and not leave the building. The grilling seemed to focus mostly on the fact that I was crossing a US-Canadian land border on foot with an Australian passport, and despite having a valid 90-day visa-waiver dated July 24 from Honolulu, this was a very strange thing to do. She didn't seem to like the fact that I wanted to visit Blaine, and seemed suspicious of my reasons for wanting to go there. (I put it together credibly at the time, but "mere curiosity and novelty" was the real reason). She even asked if I had specific friends in Vancouver and asked for names (but not addresses) and for my occupation in Australia.  I didn't hear anything for 25 minutes, and when I briefly stood up to stretch my legs, I was told by another officer to sit down.  Finally, I heard my name called and yet another officer called me to the far end of the counter. He asked me many of the same questions as the first lady, except he also asked me where I was staying in Vancouver. He seemed suspicious (but not so much as the first) that someone would want to visit a border city, take scenery photos and then leave. I even offered to show him my White Rock photos to give him some idea, but he said that was fine.  10 minutes later, he called me over and said everything was fine and I could go. He wrote "SOUTH" crudely on a 1/4-A4 torn out sheet that looked like recycle paper, and asked me to give it to the officers in the carpark. After some searching, I found said officers, gave the piece of paper to them and they accepted it and wished me to have a nice day. This was at 17:51.  So I wandered around Peace Portal Drive and Marine Drive, noting that apart from the nice harbour scenery and green-themed roads, it had that very different feel that Honolulu had - definitely not like an Australian or Canadian city. Blaine has American flags draped from almost every lamppost as well, which is quite visible (four lampposts at one intersection = four American flags).  After wandering around the town and taking a few shots, I decided to head for the border again. As I was trying to find it, I noticed two US Customs officers sitting in the emergency stopping lane of the freeway sliproad viewing me through binoculars (the town was pretty much closed up except for Subway) as I moved up D Street looking for the pedestrian exit (as the freeway clearly said "no pedestrians", unlike the Canadian side where pedestrians were directed to use the bike lane).  I found an awesome Mexican restaurant (south of the border :P) called Paso del Norte on 2nd St, where I decided I was actually hungry and would eat. I went in and ordered Arroz de Pollo (which seemed to be a huge dish with bits of chicken, capsicum, tomato, avocado and sauce on rice - and not deep-fried!) and pineapple juice, and sat down in expectation of my meal. The service was fabulous, and the food was authentic. Just as I was getting into the starters, two more Customs officials walked into the restaurant and straight up to me (to some surprise from the staff) and asked me for ID. When I provided it, they asked me how long I proposed to stay, and how long I'd been there. I said I'd been there 40 minutes since crossing at the Peace Arch, and intended to finish my meal before returning. The guy seemed a tad embarrassed when I pointed this out, and said that was fine, and left. I could hear an engine running outside the restaurant the whole time I was there, though, and it was stressful and took away from my enjoyment of the otherwise excellent meal.  After paying, I left the restaurant and realised I was a bit disoriented (the stress probably didn't help) and I didn't have a map of Blaine (my Greater Vancouver street map stopped at 8th Avenue, White Rock). Just then, I realised that the two customs guys and a third guy, this one with "US Border Police" on his sleeve, were sitting there in a car watching me. I signalled them and asked them where the exit to Canada was for pedestrians. The guy told me, and I went up to the end of the street, left at the park... and suddenly realised I was back in Canada. Douglas, BC, starts at 0 (Zero) Av and only a crude little ditch with the odd sign indicated the end of the Peace Arch Park was even a border at all. I could have walked off into suburban Vancouver without even trying, most probably.  When I got to Canada Customs, I walked round the side - to find out they were waiting for me and had my name! I showed my ID, explained that I was staying in Vancouver, gave the address, and 2 minutes later (after efficient, reasonably friendly service not unlike when I arrived in Vancouver on the 26th), I was back on Highway 99 going to a bus stop I'd found on the walk there. The guy suggested I surrender my US visa waiver. I didn't argue. I think Point Roberts is something I'll do when I feel a bit more brave.  My two run-ins with the US - the first with the state of Hawaii, which was more a culture clash, and the second in Blaine, which was more like a Nazi police state type run-in, have left me somewhat disillusioned. I actually saluted the first Canadian flag I could see on a home just off the highway between 8th and 9th Av - sure, Canada has its problems and isn't perfect, and same could be said for Australia (I'd happily have hugged an Australian flag right about then), but it is a tolerant, accepting country, and it has accepted me.

      Sadly, I missed the Sweden fireworks. I'm going to see Spain on Wednesday night and the grand finale on Saturday night though.  Sunday (Day 14) was the quietest single day since my holiday began. I wandered around the city idly for most of the day, and then went up the Harbour Centre tower, which is a lookout over Vancouver not unlike the Sky Tower in Auckland. The only downside is that the observation tower is actually lower than some of the surrounding buildings, meaning that you can't see entire sections of the city, but it was an awesome experience and well worth doing - on a clear day such as Sunday was, you can clearly see a snowy peak in the distance, that being Mt Baker in Washington State, 145km ESE of Vancouver, and Stanley Park in particular looks lovely. The lady told me that my ticket was valid all day, and to come back at sunset as it was supposed to be really good. She wasn't wrong. I spent most of the time with a couple of Australian girls off a cruise ship and a couple of Canadian Chinese who had a similar camera to me and we were trying to get the best shots.  Monday was BC Day, the "foundation day" for the province of British Columbia. Before I go on, I'm going to introduce this with some oddities about BC and Vancouver:  1. Nearly all traffic lights have a yellow frame rather than a black frame, and are like a big rectangular box with the lights "hanging" out the front. This seems to be a uniquely Canadian thing, and can be seen all over Canada. (There are yellow frame lights in the US too but they look more like ours, just painted yellow).  2. Vancouver, the city, is not on Vancouver Island. Some people call it Victoria Island, which is confusing as there is a Victoria Island off the northwest of the province.  3. The top half of the province's flag is a squished British flag, the bottom half is blue-and-white stripes with a sun rising onto it. This flag appears on all route number signs and numberplates.  4. Vancouver is a very young city even by Australian standards. It was incorporated in 1886, and before that existed only as a series of small settlements (including Langley, Daniel's home) and a rail terminus for the Canadian Pacific line. The city's first bill passed was to create Stanley Park as a defence against any future American attack.  urlLink Click here  for a much more indepth summary.  Anyway, I'll divide the day into two distinct parts:   White Rock  On a whim, rather than going to Lynn Canyon as was my plan (but I missed the bus), I headed to White Rock and Crescent Beach (getting to see South Granville and Delta on the way - the former is very classy and I may yet walk it, and the latter is entirely farmland). White Rock is almost right on the US border, about 38km SE of Vancouver (50 by the road system) and not dreadfully far from Langley, so Daniel was able to meet me at Crescent Beach.  Now, in White Rock, the idea of "beach" means quite different than the normal - it's more like a series of mud flats up to 400-500m wide, parts covered in seaweed and divided by little streams and populated by crabs and shellfish. It was still pretty cool, but neither of us particularly wanted to get our shoes dirty, so we moved on to White Rock proper, about a 7km walk away. By this stage, poor Daniel was exhausted, and his initial idea of crossing the border at Douglas-Blaine had basically wilted, so he ended up going home. I came down onto Marine Drive and walked the coast, getting some awesome photos - the place looked a tiny bit like Cottesloe or Manly, except for the totem poles and the odd-looking beaches. One thing we both noticed was the sheer number of Canada and BC flags hung from shops and homes - Canadians are certainly nationalistic, especially when close to the US border, but it's not the "in-your-face" kind of nationalism that usually grates when other countries do it. I have no idea why.  About another 6km later, after walking through the forested 8th Avenue (parallel to the border) near the Semiahmoo (SEM-ee-AH-moo) First Nation lands (translation: lots of forest and a big big caravan park) and down Highway 99, I was within view of the goal.  See next entry for the rest.

      I have had a great time here the last few days, although there's surprisingly little to report.  - Went out to Port Moody (21km E of Vancouver) on Thursday, and spent time on small community shuttle buses (which look hilarious - I'll post a pic soon) going through steep hills and thick forests, and chatting to busdrivers and other locals. It was a great time. :)  - On Friday, we slept in, and ended up going to Langley (43km SE of Vancouver), Daniel's home district, with him, but not before finding an excellent street musician outside Burrard Skytrain station named Matt who played Ben Harper and other such acoustic stuff. During my time in Langley, I actually got to sit down and spend time with Daniel (which is a rare thing when we're in the city), learned that the Trans-Canada Highway 1 is a ridiculously busy road, that Langley has a lot of interesting wood sculptures and far too many skate parks, that you can eat blackberries straight off bushes in the woods out there, and that the local markets are very good value. I had my first experience, on returning, of cooking in the hostel's communal kitchen. The meal was a bit experimental, but noone who tried it seemed to mind.  - Saturday was one of those random sort of days. Went up to Squamish (64km north of Vancouver) to see, believe it or not, a logging competition! Everyone knows I am a greenie at heart, but every year, these guys compete with each other for titles in events such as axe-throwing, climbing up and down 80m poles, chainsawing logs while standing on them, etc. It was great :) Saw some awesome mountain and ocean views on the way there and back, too. I had some great company for the trip too in a new friend, a professional photographer named Peter. We parted ways near Lions Gate Bridge and I spent about 2 hours on and around it before coming here.  The fireworks are tonight - tonight it's Sweden's turn. I wonder if they can outperform China? It'll be a tough call, but many here believe they're up to the task. This weekend will be busy in Vancouver as the gay pride parade is tomorrow, and this is a public holiday weekend as BC Day (the province's foundation day) is on Monday. I'm going to try and get out as much as possible.
