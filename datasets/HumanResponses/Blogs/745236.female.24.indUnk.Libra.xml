      oof.  feeling a bit under the weather today.  it probably didn't help that for some reason palo alto has pms at the moment...or maybe i've just nearly been run over by some crazed lunatic soccer mom in her SUPER SIZED SUV one too many times...oooohhh but people were not on my happy list.  goodness.  It was like the world got up and forgot to take its prozac this morning.  sheesh.   When you frequent Borders and Safeway in the same day, though, i think you can only expect a proverbial kick in the ass by the powers that be, especially when you claim to support independent businesses.  oooh.  did i mention i feel under the weather?  So i'm hanging out in dad's office because he has all the nifty software and such and there is a book to my right called "principles of underwater sound."  first off, it's the third edition which means there have been two editions prior to this one, which means it made enough money in the first place to get to a third edition...which i think is kind of weird in itself.  Secondly...  why does my father have a book on the principles of underwater sound?  i just don't know anymore, robin, i just don't know.  i'm getting that overwhelmed feeling again.  i wanted to accomplish a few things: finish keats's biography finish my story and my screenplay write a poem or two  and then there were like three or four other books i was in the middle of that i keep picking up and then having to scream NO NO NO NO NO YOU MUST GO TO THE BIOGRAPHY BAD LOVE NUGGET BAD  sigh.  it's 699 pages.  and really super interesting but i can't find time to read it except late at night and i have to sleep then, and ohhhh poop.  danya just wrote me,  o world, that has such people in it!  and she is doing well and i love hearing from people but especially danyakins because she always breathes warmth and love into her notes of hello.  There are some people that brighten each corner of the world they touch and she is one of them.  indeed.   okay.  i'm now treating myself to a wonderously mind-numbing mag so that i can know what is going on in the fashion world these days.  ciao bellas. lis.

      halllloooo kiddies.  Well i'm learning what a cyclical force being a working housewife/mom can be.  Drive the kid and friends where she needs to go.  pick them up.  make them dinner.  try to get some work done.  clean the house.  wash the dishes.  go to bed.  get up.  do the dishes you didn't do the night before.  start the wash.  yell at child for being a lazy butt and not helping.  drive somewhere else.  rinse, repeat, whether or not you desire.  EW I DON'T WANT CHILDREN OF ANY KIND FOR A VERY LONG TIME.  on the other hand my sister is hysterically funny.  tonight when we were driving home and i was talking to marie and i said something for some reason or other regarding the nicotine patch— Carrie:  "they're clear." Me: "uh?  okay marie..."  conversation continues.  caroline remains silent.  then—  "they're clear.  no one will know."  for like ten minutes i thought she was talking about the freaking freeway and how there was no one in front of us.  then i thought she was asking me to perform some illegal act with the motor vehicle i was commandeering.  i kept looking over like "what the HELL are you saying" and she knew i was confused and thought she was talking about the freeway so she just kept saying "no one will know a thing.  they're clear, you know."  Finally i learned that she was actually talking about the patch, and how it is clear.  WHY IS MY SISTER INSANE.  Yeah so we just got back from a fun family gathering and i think i must remind grandpa of someone in his family because every time i see him he tells me i'm the spitting image of a McKenna.  yaaay irish.  john thought the sticker on the back of j.r. was for "irish rugby league."  i'm like, john, it's for Ireland.  hence IRL, and the shamrock, you dweeb.  and he's like "oh.  right."  then he and carrie started laughing about a story when they played some computer game together and beat people up with crowbars.  it was like carjacker II or something, i don't know.  they thought it was funny.  i thought it was funny too, but i didn't say so.  they're kinda freaky sometimes.  no updates, really.  my cousins are cute.  matthew is adorable and i sang to him and he LIKED it, so BOLLOCKS to those of you who don't like it when i sing.  He might be 8 months old but he knows the difference between bad singing and good singing.  maybe.  i like bumblebee bumble bee tuna  right.  i'm frightened because my sister just started laughing hysterically and then said "have you found jesus" in this really weird voice so i think i better go.  i'm tired.  ohh!  robinwilliamsbyebye  lis.

      another episode of here's what's true:  single mothers are gods in my book.  my cds have run out of shelf space.  sometimes you just need a clean house (if you can't handle the 409, get out of the kitchen).  nothing can be wrong with a day when you stumble across a child's haiku chaulked out in pink across a fountain's edge.  i am now going to play our piano.  stop—  i need a new beat thank you for your patience lis.

      rule one.  do not eat very old cheese.  i know it's all mold but there is good mold, and there is *bad* mold.  rule two.  do not watch anything with diana rigg on a day which you are suffering from a fat attack.  rule three.  do not eat an entire pan of scalloped potatoes.  you're not that hungry, and they're not that good.  So I broke all three of these rules today, in the past three hours, in fact.  It was not wise, nor was it especially enjoyable.  My sister stole my wine and I don't feel i can be held accountable for her behavior at this point, as I am too tired.  It's just half a glass of wine, anyway.  Although she is jumping around the kitchen yelling "if you dance like this people will throw money at you!  now all i need is a monkey!" in a voice resembling the late walter matthau's.  Did i spell that right?  hmmm.  doubtful.  Sometimes I wish I were in animé.  No, not like, in the business.  i mean like, *in* it.  There's always something huge going on and those people always have really intense relationships all the time.  it might be stressful but i feel like you'd get used to it after awhile and damn sometimes they're cool-looking.  ohhhh yeah.  now we all know where my brain is right now.  okay that's IT. lis.

      well i'm assuming most of you realize this but: don't email me at work.  I'm not there.  use the alum email, or hotmail.  ooookay.  I'm still feeling kind of sheisty about all that but i guess it will pass.  it just makes me a little sick to my stomach.  I need to bring cheer back into my life and i don't know how to do it.  Moving away will help.  That however, is not happening for a month and i can't get depressed for a month and then go and cheer up.  It doesn't help that my sister is having a fit and i'm feeling really icky in a bathing suit, as i discovered today at the pool.  oh well.  maybe my therapist will assist me.  And running once in awhile would help.  sigh.  yeah i don't have too much to say at the moment.  everyone's in a bad mood and it's not really making me want to write oodles of goodness in the weblog.  I just feel like an idiot, lately.  I feel like I should have known better, and I didn't, and now i just feel stupid and somewhat ashamed of myself.  Like maybe it didn't have anything to do with homophobia and maybe i'm just too much of an open book.  Ohhhhh well.  i think i'll go investigate the Paris Bon Appetit.  And perhaps purchase some ellen on my trip out.  lis

      hiya. Susie called today and this makes me happy because i missed my best friend.  Also, we employed the colon method and that is useful.  Oh and she told me what my present was which was possibly one of the most beautiful things ever.  I like it when my friends know me, I mean really really know me.  the recent psychotic episode in my life is now over and i'm glad of it.  I apparently am more naive than i thought.  And i guess i trust people too much.  Because what happened with all that to me...well it just seems nearly vindictive.  but the fact that everyone i know was outraged about it makes me feel a little bit better about the world.  at the same time it makes me recognize (butterface get out of my HEAD) the kind of stuff I am going to have to encounter in the future.  I guess, all I can say is, now I know.  So that's that.  i think they shot the last j. crew catalogue at wellesley.  No really.  I know you guys are laughing at me for paying attention to the j. crew catalogue but seriously, people, has anyone seen it?  Look at the back cover.  mmmm jeff buckley.  i'm just in one of those moods.  I haven't written anything lately and i think instead of whining i'm going to go and do it.  i leave you with my guilt poem.  lis.  *please and thank yous*  no i haven’t  been			writing 	she said glancing up at the clock which said it was half past the hour minus three minutes and that didn’t seem to make all the difference because she didn’t have anything to show it’s 		ALL	IN	HERE >touches forefinger which is slightly blistered from guitar strings to the side of her brow slightly sunburnt from a walk earlier that day along the resevoir upon which she saw at least eight rabbits and an owl  but i 	do	write			poetry youknow i	do		write sometimes.  ***  no i haven’t been writing, she said. and in her head the idea that she was a hasbeen before she was ever somebody loomed frighteningly like a lightbulb in a bare room swinging back and forth in the genre of a film somewhere between a western and a crime scene “is that your poetry sitting there, like an abandoned child? when was the last time you fed it?  hmmm?” “GUILTY!  I PLEAD GUILTY!”   i only see it 				in little 		clips, you see. it flashes through my head but it’s usually when 	i’m driving or someplace without a pen. and then i just don’t have the time to write it all down and those ideas they pop up and shout at me and i continue to stare out the window but sometimes,  i do.  I do write them down, sometimes.  it doesn’t really bother me, anyway. what you think. that doesn’t bother me. i write for me.  hereliesonewhosenamewaswritinwater? what does that mean, anyway?  I think he was just trying to get attention.  and now have you 			been			there?  and seen that 		grave? there are CATS all over it.  CATS!  little cats.  it’s not important, see, the point is— it’s all about, the feeling... when i’m in that state of expression... what is it you’re looking for, exactly? yes.  yes i do, write poems, 				sometimes.   .march 25, 2002, 10:03 pm

      here's what is true:  i watched a taping of ellen's tour from two summers ago.  she is wonderful. laughter and love are wonderful. the gay community is wonderful when it laughs. and being gay, is *hard*.  i am learning this.  slowly, but surely, i am learning this.  my award of the day goes to andrea kennedy for being the marvelous quaker baby that she is, for piercing her nose, and for making me laugh.  in other news; i want catherine zeta jones's hair in this commercial.  ooooo.  hot.  lis

      um. oh. my. god.  well i know we said there would be silence but something has come up.  my mother just fired me to avoid a sexual harrassment suit.  oh my FUCKING god.  so, yes, i just got hauled out to the park, THE PARK, PEOPLE, what is this jerry maguire i don't even know, and mom told me that elizabeth had gone to colleen (my sister said "yes you should be pissed, she told this to an OLD WOMAN first") and told her that she was upset because i had asked her out on mulitple dates and she was uncomfortable because she thought i was developing an obsession with her, especially because of my prior obsessive relationship with a woman.  oh my god.  so then colleen tells my mom. them mom hauls me out to the park. and told me to go home.   i don't even know.  i am so totally flabbergasted.  okay, crush aside, and we all know that i'm a little nutty when i crush on someone, everyone is, but let's just review: she's 27 and straight. i never asked her out on a date.  friendship.  FRIEND.  SHIP.  COME HANG OUT WITH ME AND MY FRIENDS. I didn't take her "rejection" as a "i can't date you" rejection cos i WASN'T ASKING HER OUT. does she THINK i'm stupid?  How many unsolved mysteries does she watch a day?  Um, not everybody is a stalker.  I know this is difficult to realize.  if you want a 22 year old gay stalker i'll do my best to go find you one.  i'm sure there's a club.  but currently i don't qualify so maybe you should get over yourself and not be an ASSHOLE. ew.  ew.  i am now going to borrow katie's phrase. THIS IS SO LAME I WANT TO PUKE ALL OVER IT.  okay, and then, where do you get off telling colleen about it, and on top of that, making presumptions about my former relationship?  you weren't there.  you don't know.  that's an alien fucking planet and you don't know if there's air, okay?  oooooo i'm so mad.  i'm so so so mad.  you know, i didn't go blabbing all her business to everyone in the office, including my mother.  where does she get off doing this?  that ho.  what the buggery bollocks is this?  i resign your favorite stalker lis.  oh ps: yesterday's poem wasn't really having anything to do with her, in case you were wondering.  i just liked it cos it was pretty and had originally found it when i was looking for a dedication for sarah and eric in the book i was making them.  but if your name was elizabeth, YOU WOULD PROBABLY CITE THAT AS EVIDENCE OF MY STALKING NATURE.  ho and a half ew.

      back at work.  i think there is an ant crawling somewhere on my body and i can't find it and it's a little bit creepy.  i just had a lovely talk with erin hogan.  it was nice.  new people are good.  it also teaches me not to pay too much credence to first impressions.  if i did that alison would still be my arch enemy.  as would susie, come to think of it.  and ms. brayton.  Each one of whom i was afraid of and assumed hated me upon first interaction.  ooooookay.  lis

      sometimes you want to put something in this cos it's like a regular journal and then you remember it's a public journal so you don't but it messes with continuity.  i think that keats must have had a very moody disposition.  screenplay.   okay wait a minute wait a minute who's that i got the ill communications.  i don't feel particularly hung-over, despite the however many sake bombs of yesterday.  then again i did get up and drink an entire nalgene, take 4 advil and a vitamin, and eat a lot of strawberries as a precautionary measure.  i do feel kind of unsettled. retreat, captain, retreat!  glad for my bed. i desire solitude and i don't have any offhand to gather oh i just want them all to go away for like, six days lis

      carrie's home!  i didn't see her until this morning, though, cos i was too tired to go to the airport.  but she came back with tea, and a teacup for my mom from a chateau, and something i forget what for my dad but it was cool...shoot...oh well but yes and a little change purse for me (i laughed.  "what did your sister get you in paris?"  "a change purse.").  it sounds funny but actually it's very cute, and i needed one so she's a smartie.  Last night, karoliina and i went and sat on the steps of the Paly theater and had a moment.  it was fun.  she cries your name three times again she cries your name how long can this love remain   hmmm i have to go get pics developed.  and...yes i read tennyson this morning because elizabeth said he was her favourite poet and i couldn't for the life of me understand why, so i went back to look at his stuff.  In Memoriam A. H. H. is really really good.  And Break, Break, i enjoyed.  that's about it.  he doesn't really do it for me otherwise.  But talk about being preoccupied with death.  Although what it says about me that those two poems are the ones that appealed to me i don't know.  i wish i could remember what the artist she said was, i'll have to ask her on monday today we film the K.C. and Dee. Lishious show or however you spell karoliina's name and brayton is our camera woman yeeeeeeeah  i want her to be in it though.  she's so freakin funny.  who else could actually pull off bloody marys and crafts?  certainly not me.  where did my de la soul cd go????  hey you've got to hide your love away  i miss erin ford.  and we're back together again and i'm never gonna lose you as a friend lis.

      miriam webster's word of the day was:  tenebrous   \TEH-nuh-bruss\   (adjective)      1 : shut off from the light : dark, murky     *2 : hard to understand : obscure      3 : causing gloom  AND I'M SPENT.  okay, well, here's what's true:  1.  i screwed THAT up. 2.  one should learn not to blush madly when one's crush is revealed, especially when one's intentions are entirely, okay mostly entirely wholesome and intending friendship especially because of the potential discomfort the party in question might feel.  Because if one does this, one gets shafted in the worst way possible of being told that one's company is undesired, because the party in question (as one can only gather from extrapolation of cryptic utterances of "well, i mean, but, it's just that") is uncomfortable with one's infered amourous feelings towards said party. 3.  #2 was awkwardly put.  let's just say i'm a tool and leave it at that.  this is why i hate relationships, crushes, and pretty much anyone who might distract me from my recently re-attained purity.  they take up way too much time in my thoughts and i can't focus on life.  stoooopid.  i wrote a poem today.  it went like this:  kingship.  king me!  cried the boy his brown eyes staring just left of the sun. the woman placed a red atop his red, crownside up.  i can rule the world, said the boy. you can rule yourself, said the woman. but the world is so big!  protested the boy. your mind is all the world, replied his companion. she pushed her black along a new square, out, ready for his jump. you let me? asked the boy. the woman tilted her head to one side, as though the thoughtful gaze required the brain to lean against its bedpost. i offered, said the woman. she leaned across to him, and noses almost touched. her mouth was very close, and cut upside down, like a scythe. his hands stayed very still in front of him. then he inched forward and studied the lines of her face. his fingers reached up and traced them. he sat back down, stolen treasures in his skin. now i know, said the boy. he lowered his gaze and looked at the ground, and saw shadows.   July 19, 2002 8:29 pm   i wrote it in an email.  just emailing, and there was a poem.  i don't know why i wrote it but i did.  so there it is.  i am, to tell the truth, sad.  i thought i had found a friend, and i found a fear.  I think. i don't know what it is i found.  today actually i wanted to cry.  now this was strange; i didn't know why i wanted to cry.  it's been awhile since the tearducts and i were in contact.  i don't cry when i laugh, i don't cry when i'm sad or frustrated much lately, either.  i just kind of shake my head and make my hair stick out on end and then i forge ahead through it.  which i think is probably normal.  i had gotten so used to crying everyday before that i didn't know how not to cry.  now it's funny that i seem to have forgotten how to find that release.  but i didn't cry.  i almost did but i wasn't in the right place so i didn't.  and i wasn't sure what i wanted to cry about, either.  I think it had to do with feeling sad that i was not someone's friend when i wanted to be, but i think it had to do with some other things too, which might be why i didn't cry about it.  since that bag of sins and i didn't want to mix just today.  you know art is a funny thing.  sometimes it feels so big, i mean monstrously big like i can't look at all of it at once and it gives me dizzy spells trying to see what's in it, and then sometimes i don't know where it's gone and i wander around aimlessly looking for something useful to do in its absence but i just can't find a thing to supplement the void.  i used to feel this way about people. i think i still do, i just am better at ignoring the void.  maybe?  hmmm.  maybe that's what today was.  i saw the people void again and got frustrated that it was still there.  but then, oh i don't know.  i've been in such a solitary mood lately i can't think of why the void would bother me.  i've talked to all my friends whom i love more than anything.  friends are great.  they're really just so great.  and my sister comes home tonight, and even though they bug me to no end my family is around.  But for some reason people are making me lonely right now.  and i want to kind of soak up some of that lonliness before i start equating it with friends.  okay.  i want to go read some keats.  this record was homegrown in california by lis.

      hello, again, all my children.  it has been not so many hours.  but i am wickedly bored and rather than read a book i would like to expostulate on the values of vanilla coke.  Vanilla coke: cream soda?  you tell ME the difference.  when our civilization becomes to future bloggers what the incas are to us, i wonder if they will find a can of vanilla coke and, despite the expiration date, crack it to taste its freshness.  And then laugh because we are such suckers to advertizing ploys to think that this is really any different than: a) coke with extra syrup b) cream soda  guess which beverage i am enjoying as we speak? it's not really all that bad, if you like that sort of thing.  which i do.  now you know more about me.  don't you feel special?  you, oh random surfer of the web who may have accidentally stumbled upon my frighteningly active weblog, know that i, lis, enjoy vanilla coke.  Now you know a fact about me.  It will fascinate you for years and years because our society is obsessed with celebrity and the private lives of strangers and then, when i'm dead and famous, and someone mentions me, your grandchildren (i'm not that old so if i die before you, you are not old enough to be reading this in the first place) will say "she liked vanilla coke!" and that will go into some poor shmuck biographer's book on the double life of elisabeth hamilton.  the other half i haven't figured out yet but if they wrote a book about me i'm sure it would say i have a double life.  I like to pretend that i will be famous in the future.  you may have noticed this, as i mention it frequently.  some people plan their weddings.  i plan my fame.  this does not, however, rule out divorce or failure. however, i'm remaining optimistic, mostly for the sake of your marriages.  it's all one big bucket of hope, you know.  how come max disappeared? you know max?  i thought the eighties were back.  (we're returning to the coke theme now, for those of you who are lost).  Bryan told me they were, and that the hippest of the hip were wearing a-symmetrical tank-tops with a shoulder pad in the side with the sleeve.  the bands have resurfaced.  why hasn't max come back?  they should do a re-release of Weird Science and since all they do is play ads before movies now, play a Max new coke ad.  That would fufill my cinematic experience.  i do hope no one takes me seriously.  marie said today that she couldn't think of anyone who didn't like me (i can think of some people, so that's just not true, but whatever) and despite the fact that i was a shitty friend in my former life i have now regained my wit and charm and love and she very much appreciates my company.  which i thought was quite nice of her.  But i assume i am a generally likable person.  The only thing that occurs to me is if people took me seriously, they might think me arrogant and rude and egotistical.  Don't you guys know sarcasm is a defense mechanism??? it's like when susie and i say we're hot!  we're doing it to boost each other's egos and at the same time undermine the absurdity of an emphasis on outward appearances, which despite our proclaimed rejection of societal values we buy into, because why in the hell ELSE would one own eyeliner????  huh?  ah.  yes.  well k-dog just called and wants to go get a beer.  so again i do not get to tell you guys anything deep, which i was planning on getting to.  marie, however, requested that i post my birthday rap for her, so voila:  happy happy happy birthdaaaaaaaay  you are 23 you know that's hip we send all of our graphics to a place called pip  i'm a hip hop rapper and i know what's funk you might look at me and think ah nah she's a punk but i'm cute with some extras the mc of sextris you gotta give me room cos you know i drive a lexus  ah nah it's an audi in my wheels i'm a hottie i gotchoo a birthday cake but don't worry it ain't naughty  now listen up y'all cos my lyrics are true you turned the big 2-3 and it's makin me blue all the way across the country and it's quite an endeavor i'm stuck data processing like my name was trevor i wish i could be there can't afford the airfare the man is pushin me down into welfare  not really that's a lie education is fly i eat my turkey samiches on bread that's rye  okay i gotta give it to you straight like this: of all the pretty people you're the one i miss don't mistake me for a hatah the irish dig potatahs i forgot my phone so i gotta call you latah (call you latah...call you latah...call you latah...)   and they said hip hop was dead....hah hah. now it is.  i just killed it.  doh.  tune in for the next episode...same bat time, same bat channel. lis.

      okay so: happy birthday to tempe happy birthday to marie   i am now ending the saga that is my STUPID HEAD and you guys will just have to find out about that from me.  because it's gotten so ridiculous that i talked so fast into the phone that marie couldn't understand for the life of her what i was saying.   so i know it's gotten out of control.  my head is being played with.  'tis.  modest mouse is better than i remembered them being i like it when i put cds away for a long time and then pull them out again and they turn out to be good.  new thought: panic panic panic i'm no good at writing i'll never amount to anything i'll never get published other people i know might and then i'll be a failure again i never should have proclaimed myself a poet if i can't do it properly   okay.  well now that's passed  i know i said i wouldn't just now but SHE'S FLUENT IN RUSSIAN.  RUSSIAN.  IT'S NOT LIKE A ROMANCE LANGUAGE, OR SOMETHING, PEOPLE, IT'S RUSSIAN.  i'm going to cry.  the world is evil.  stacked against me.  RUSSIAN.  m-er f-er RUSSIAN, DAMMIT, RUSSIAN.  today was a weird day.  i'll tell you about it sometime.  lis.

      welcome.  to the aye aye forest.  have a pleasant stay.  you know, i have no idea who reads this.  it's a very funny thing that i might be virtually talking to myself.  But when i'm all famous and crap like that you guys can be like, "oh, yeah, i read her web log.  we were tight."  And then they'll find this and document it, maybe even insert my definition of martha stewart in webster's dictionary.  I didn't include hype and ...wait the other one was...oh right.  bitchwhore.  but, yes.  despite my probable errors in naming the parts of speech, because feck if i know what a friggin gerund is, or however you spell it, i think webster would find me quite witty.  yeah, well, i didn't have mr. bergstrom in high school.  eat me.  okay, here's what's true: despite my thorough attempts to discover how to fix the html code, i instead discovered this: they want my money, and in exchange they'll give me italics.  and a few other things.  Me:  eeeeeeeeeeevil. blogger.com:  ehhhxcellent, smithers.  so.  the question is, now, do i continue my sad bold/italics/linkless existence, with a set template, OR do i do a little research and find out the best and cheapest form of blogger.com and then fork over the cash?  i think we'll see how long i keep this up.  so far it's addictive but like, everything is addictive at first.  if i'm still writing in a month then maybe i might need to purchase some extra features.  if i'm not, then foo on that.  erin sent me an extra special lovely thing today proving the existence and probability of my attractiveness and sexual appeal.  hmmm.  thank you erin.  i think i will remain here in heartbreak hotel for awhile longer, however, as i do not believe you that i am a)hot b)hopeful c)seductive like a latté.  okay i added the latté part but yeeeeeeeeeeah.  yeah.  But i have to say the #11 in your list: #10+#8 = SEX FOR LIS bit was very entertaining, to say the least.  I, however, am chillin in my little sexless haven where literature abounds.  And then i get jealous because fictional characters in the freaking norton anthology are having more sex than i am.  But when you think about it, fictional characters are *always* having more sex than anyone, because all you have to do is flip to the page where they're having sex and voila, there they are, going at it.  My life is like keats's urn.  The tension's always there.  Never the follow-through.  I wonder if keats had a problem with the follow-through. okay now i'm getting loopy.  I AM PONDERING THE SEX LIFE OF JOHN KEATS, PEOPLE.  SAVE ME.  You know i just went over this and i think somehow this is the problem.  Sex.  Is the problem.  If i did not have any of my thoughts occupied with: sex subcategory: a certain person who works in my office sleep food subcategory: my caloric intake and its direct correspondence with the size of my ass sex  then i, too, could write things about negative capability and unknown species of butterflies.  Or, more importantly, i could compose in both verse *and* prose *and* still give myself room for the occasional bathroom joke.  brilliant. okay, so now this is also weird.  i wonder how much sex shakespeare had? you know?  i mean, honestly!  sex takes up a lot of time and thought and energy.  at least good sex does.  really.  how could you write that much and still have time for sex?  but how could you write that well and not have sex all the time?  this feels like it must be a bidirectional relationship and i just can't figure it out.  As far as I know you can't write much beyond the scope of your experience and imagination.  imagination is helpful but it's much harder to ground writing in just imagination than experience.  So where does a person get the time and the energy to have enough experiences to write that kind of brilliance, and still experience more things while writing about the old ones?  It baffles me.  I think i need to go read merchant.  Really i want to go read twelfth night (i mean come on, look at that first line, people.  if music be the food of love, play on.  dammit, that's some poor sucker in it, you know?  that means the man must've felt that.  but how the heck can you write *anything,* i mean *anything at all,* when you're that depressed that you're lying around eating grapes and listening to mandolins all day?  granted it's a dramatization but you know what i mean, right?).  OOOOO.  i haven't hit up the nun play in awhile.  hmmmm.  do i have it in pelican single text form?  no the problem is that when i start reading them, then i want to start acting them, and when i start acting them, i go into a funk because i'm acting them all by myself.  ooooooooooooh well poop. oh!  my babysittee from a former life just called.  she wants to play scrabble.  the big sister in me must respond.  anon, good nurse.  lis.

      this is the definition from yesterday, taken from an email to dees and harry it's funnier if i put in the italics.  alas i am too lazy to fix my html at the moment.  lis.  Stewart, Martha (stOO-wart, MAR-tha), pn: 1.  America's Happy Homemaker on speed. 2.  Loved by millions despite her psychotic tendencies. 3.  Dumb as fuck for her insider trading fiasco. 4.

      mama you can choose the rain but i choose the sun   just went on a very fast run.  i did a hard mile and that was it.  i feel pretty good having done it; it's better than changing into my pj's at 6 and resigning myself to the tv and my book.  shameless. flirtation.  who, me?  yes well.  i was in elizabeth's office today and made an ass of myself.  Looking through one of her cabinets for a file and she took off her jacket, remarking that it was really hot in the room.  So of course, my reflexes kick in, and i say: Yeah, sorry.  That can happen when I'm in a room.  She literally froze midair...i mean she was in the middle of typing something and she stops to look at me sideways, with a half-smile on her face and an expression of "lis did you just say what i think you said?" and so i look up, totally busted...  "hahh.  hah hah.  i crack myself up." "Yeah it seems the latte has officially kicked in..."  DOH.  of course she was really nice and goofy with me the rest of the day so i think she was halfway intrigued.  I didn't totally blow it.  That's good.  It would have been much worse if she'd figured me out and then freaked.  Of course now I'm sure she's going home and telling her roommates "um...i think my boss's kid has a crush on me..."  and you would be CORRECT.  Let's look at what's behind door number three...a cruise into my psyche!  That's right, thank you for playing.  okay.  dinner time.  i had more to say maybe but really that was it, i just wanted to post my embarassing tidbit of the day because i found it entertaining.  later i might post my definitions of particular phrases, which are equally if not more entertaining.  sigh.  someone get me out of my own head.  it only gets me in trouble.  this has been a moment with lis.

      i. am. so. tired.  i've got 8 pages but i didn't work on it at all today because karoliina and suzie and i went to the zoo and then after a starbucks kick (it is amazing how you can always count on a starbucks to pop up in any sort of commercialized area, even near the beach) k and i went to the beach despite our pooped-outness to dip our feet and speak in british accents which were quite terrible probably but it was amusing nonetheless.  what the buggery bollocks is this?  hee hee okay.  out of my system i swear.  cigarettes and chocolate milk  a good song for the day.  i've been thinking. as i often do.  i don't know why i can be so verbose (although according to smk i can *talk* all the live-long day) when it comes to email and this thing, and when i get in front of new people i freeze up.  Or even sometimes in regular conversation.  i'm a one man guy in the morning same in the afternoon one man guy when the sun goes down i whistle me a one-man tune  elizabeth comes back tomorrow.  (god forbid she ever, EVER see this.  i am officially removing this post if i ever let her in on my blogging practices).  I'm trying hard not to think about it.  you can see i'm doing a sexcellent job.  it's occured to me in little blips throughout the day.  it's very weird.  lindsay and i talked once about how we just see people and we decide to make them our friends.  i did that with elizabeth, and i don't know if it's working so well.  she's very hard to crack.  sometimes she's amazingly open and funny and relaxed, like when we went to coffee before she left, and then sometimes it's like she's off-limits.  Mom says she doesn't really get close to people; she's very private about things.  Elizabeth told me herself she only lets like a few people in at a time and that's kind of it for that.  So i keep my distance but we click really well anyway...sigh.  I need to learn to stop doing this.  Katherine, Dees, please smack me next time you see me.  I'm starting to worry this little crush has taken root in my head.  But yes Karoliina i want to take the cigarette idea, if i may, that you came up with because i think it's hysterical.  little things like that are so key.  i'll credit you.  and if i make enough money i'll buy you a house after i get one for me and one for my mom.  i've been listening a lot to kip's tunes.  they get into my sinews.  I like it.  thank yous to niall for sending it to me.  now if you would only resurface...  brilliant email from mr. joshua samuels the other day.  i am glad to hear he is happy and covered in dirt.  it made me smile.  remind me to reply.  i should go do that, actually.  shoot i had all these things i wanted to talk about okay well here's one.  i have this dream.  it happens about once a week, and comes in two forms.  in one of them i have strings attached to me, and faceless (well, invisible, maybe, as i never actually see them i just know they're there) people tuggin on either end.  I know if i go with one of them, i will go down a path of love.  but this path also includes intense suffering and major difficulty, despite its rewards.  it also represents isolation, oddly enough. the other is like, satisfaction and normalcy, but it also includes bitterness and hatred.  the other version is without the strings, without the people, but there are just two paths.  it's very simple.  it seems almost too fabricated to be a dream; i feel like my subconscious is weirder than that, you know?  but i'm standing there and i simply can't make up my mind, and i feel so torn but i know if i don't make up my mind i'll die, or maybe freeze.  it's like move forward, or be trapped in stasis which equals death.  i don't know.  i think i keep having these dreams because i keep making the decision over and over.  and i always go with the love path, but i keep having moments where i doubt it and so i come to the fork again.  that is all. i'm tired.  i must sleep.  somebody send me some irish tunes i need a little more fiddle in my life  lis.

      page five.  currently.  five...is that right?  no okay four.  i've been writing for the past half hour and with a little bit of splicing from my unfinished story, which really i'm only using one scene from (it didn't get that far) it's flowing.  I am having so much fun with this.  i wrote a layout of the plot in my journal, just a kind of general thing, and i don't know how long it will be or what random things will insert themselves as i go but it's definitely working.  i may get around to posting some of it if i feel like it, but more than likely i won't until it's finished and set and i've edited it and had a few friends look at it, etc.  ms. brayton requested that i post some poems.  ummm...let's see... that's too bitter. no, wait, that's too bitter. that one...definitely too bitter. hee hee.  this is entertaining.  God, i'm a bitter jaded individual on paper.  how sad!  Remind me not to show my portfolio to anyone in the health services.  They'd lock me up.  okay, for real now.  this is the first poem i wrote and ever actually liked.  It's rough, i think, but i like it still.  4 x 6  Looking at what used to be Never can get us back there. This image of your laughter has been dried of sound and flattened out, shrunken, pasted on a wall so I don’t forget what laughing looks like. So that I don’t forget when I listen to the hissing sound of dead air on the telephone dull electric  what it was like to hear music from your mouth. I cannot make this picture sing.   October 7th, 2000   okay, here's another one, which i just discovered and don't remember writing, particularly, but i think i sent it to erin at one point...  nursery rhyme from the hospital bed  the ink on my fingers is staining my throat it’s staining it all over every word i speak. rum tum tubble let’s kick through the rubble let’s dig up our four letter words and rum tum tubble look at all this trouble look at these ink stains and the little spot on her right hand where she scraped it against the wall that was for you.  Yes for you a gift a gift from mr. tom hubble wasn’t it nice his suggestion wasn’t it nice of mr. tom hubble? call him tim! this is grimmer than the ink that is spilling out of my typewriter all over the pages of my new novella which is only semi-autobiographical a spot of blood for a spot of ink which spells out words i think every word i speak spilled through a punched hole in the wall of my rum tum tubble   This was for a poetry class i took this fall.  nobody seemed to understand the middle line, but i left it anyway:  reflecting  driving at night her vision is poor the little lights flicker in and out and in and out as that motorcycle goes by she thinks just for a split second what if  —sees him caught on the sideview mirror in the mesh of a leather exterior—  driving too fast at night and the barrier weaves like a fishtail   okay, and here's a final one, written for the same class.  I feel like it should have been called "and ode to starbucks" instead of "Tuesday," but whatever.  "Tuesday" works too, i guess.  Tuesday  Today seems stenciled. As if each word running across the page was its own, separate slogan spelled out in bubble letters still waiting to be filled. The woman in the coffee shop asks in her usual routine how I would like my mocha sized and glancing upward I notice her words like a character in a comic book floating in little bubbles above her head. Tall.  Grande.  Venti? It’s like that with everything today. An explosion of road signs and hollowed slogans, smacking me directly in the gut. The flashing bulbs around the name of a chain bookstore scream out to passers-by although their sparks have little to say in broad daylight.  I could easily find this offensive, but I don’t. Because it’s all still hollow no matter how loud it gets and nothing is worse than Yesterday (Yesterday was charcoal, all smudged together meanings in which I could not decipher the letters behind her eyes). Tomorrow things will still go unsaid. Tomorrow, I might overcome the fear of losing my voice in this mess and try to speak. I imagine it would be clear, and lasting, like a wine glass ringing— crystal. Tomorrow, I will duck my head, close my eyes, and think of silence.   i think maybe that one's a little heavy handed.  whatever, all my poetry is.  i'm such a melancholic.  It's the irish, or something, i suppose.  my screenplay, however, is glorious.  when carrie gets old enough i'm going to make her open a production company with me and we're going to make the greatest films EVAH.  this has been a post by ed 20 davis in da HAUS  Katherine, please do not go throw yourself onto the incoming traffic on Ralston Ave after reading my melodramatic lyric.  Also, if you or Dees happen to find out what the godfather ice cream truck song source is, please let me know.  I'm still curious about it.  and please remember: pain heals. chicks dig scars. glory lasts forever.   lis.

      brainstorm.  we all know by now that i'm conflicted about my future; i.e. there's too many things i want to do (actor, writer, director, teacher, possibly get my ph.d., do amature graphic design, paint, sketch, photograph, learn 15 languages, travel all over the world...and i really wanted to do this stuff by the time i was like, 50, so i don't know what is going to happen).  so.  as i'm going to actually teach, and i am excited about that, i have to figure out what i can sort of filter through for the remainder of the summer.  the thing is, as i was idly surfing and waiting for the credit card machine to kick over its latest payment process (oh my job is so thrilling), i stumbled across a friend's website from high school.  he's started this indie film company called cyan pictures.  i feel like cyan is also a computer company or some such thing but we'll ignore that for the moment.  anyway he also posted on the paly alum website, in his listing, and i nearly wet myself because i mean, okay.  it's josh newman.  and he's ridiculous, but also ridiculously successful and the fact that he's actually doing something cool now, or maybe he was before but i was possibly resentful, as i never understood how someone at the age of 19 or whatever he was could be deemed "a veritable doogie howser" by forbes magazine when they have that flip and have had it since 7th grade...  okay.  so i emailed josh, and not that he's gotten back to me because apparently they're in kentucky filming the first short.  but i told him i'd hop on the bandwagon if they needed a hand at anything (although i would give my left arm to act again.  but see, then i looked around and noted that they were actually acting like a *real* film company, that seeks actors who have head shots, and resumes, etc.  bollocks to professionalism, i've got a resume, dammit).  Yes.  So pondering this, i began to think about the eight million projects i've got lying around my computer.  I realize given my weblog you might not *think* I was a linguistic genius; you would be wrong.  I'm also quite bashful.  : )  No but honestly, I need to hone in on writing again, and i'm thinking that i have the entire month of august off.  an *entire* month.  Granted i'm meant to move and find an apt and register and all that.  Yes, yes, details, details.  But i'm thinking about all this free time.  And really, if anyone recalls my project of "the great american novel," that's my film.  It's meant to be a screenplay, and not a short story.  I'm not writing it like a short story.  I see it as film shots in my head, which is very different from how i see other things I write.  It's like driving to work in the morning and listening to Cake and laying out the video as the song spins through the stereo.  I do this frequently.  So say I wrote this screenplay.  Say I actually finished it.  Say i got erinford cozens and possibly mandrea and a few selected other people to be in it with me.  and then, let's just say, let's just say perchance that i showed the script to josh and he liked it and then he was like okay, i'll spend my money on you, because forbes called me a veritable doogie howser and you've blackmailed me by threatening to reveal my hideous high school past.  I actually could not do this because i know nothing bad about josh other than that he's a little egotistical, okay probably a lot egotistical but nice enough to drop me a new year's hello anyway so not all that bad, but let's just hypothesize for a moment, shall we?  I could be at sundance in three years, people.  Back to reality, lis.  Yeah okay it was just a thought.  Regardless of whether josh takes on the script i'm still writing it, and if i have to buy my own damn camera and make my own film that's fine by me.  It might not make it to sundance, but then again, maybe i'll just send it off to Cannes.  I need a little beach time, anyway.  Screw you, Robert Redford.  oh shoot.  I realized i hadn't factored kids into my life plan.  oh man, that's a whole problem unto itself.  i am now going to finish stuffing these envelopes and then go watch The Royal Tenenbaums for artistic inspiration.  It's out, isn't it?  my brain is a veritable blockbuster  lis.

      hola, on the second day of my adventure.  has anyone seen that abfab where she does the videodiary of her diet?  i feel like i'm entering something equally weird with this.  except unscripted, unpaid, and i'm not quite as brilliantly funny.  Carrie is still in france.  I WANT MY SISTER TO COME BACK.  She wrote me a postcard which i got the other day.  It opened with:  I was thinking of stealing some cheese and putting it in my pocket.  My parents' postcard was very cute, very "bonjour!  France is manifique!" etc.  Carrie writes me and tells me all about the crazy New Zealander on her trip who has no sense of direction and wanders around the metro going "wait, i know it's here somewhere, now hold on a moment"...awwww.  i miss my sis.  luckily she's coming back in 8 days and then soon after that my parents are going on the conference and that means a WEEK with just me and carrie.  AHAHHAHAHAH.  we will cause mayhem and destruction.  okay.  so i have a haunted radio. every once in awhile the radio in my office will just go on.  and then sometimes if i let it go, cos i actually care about what's on NPR, after about 20 minutes it will go off again.  Inexplicably. Hmmm.  In other news:  i would like to thank erin ford for her marvelous email this morning, in which i learned a special little tidbit about a former theatre instructor, whose sex life apparently erin knows allllllllllllll about. sick.  ahhhhhhh, but funny.  Also, i have officially been deemed healthy by my therapist, unable to qualify for any sort of depression study, and therefore can go out on the world with a sealed stamp of approval from michelle.  Hence, i am going straight to New York.  Where happiness abounds.  Ummmm...good lis.  I wrote two (single spaced!) pages last night towards niall's story.  this might not seem like a lot but when you haven't written anything in like months and months of substance its actually quite an accomplishment.  the problem (and there's always one, isn't there...no, the glass is half full, half full, dammit...of margaritas, mmmmm) is that the more i write on this story the farther away i get from the end.  It's like the characters get more interesting and then i can't just be like, oh, okay, you do that and you do that and then we'll stop.  i have no direction.  arrrrrrrrrgh.  did i want to write a novel?  no.  i just want to write a little short story and the stupid thing won't end.  END THE MADNESS, SOMEONE.  okay.  i must return to data entry.  in the meantime, go play on zembla and look at all of the magical criticism that surrounds nabokov's world.  because i am recently obsessed with the only class i received a C in and so i'm pretending like i actually know more than i do.  Brian Boyd and i are *tight*.  lis.

      Okay, it took a second to find it, but here you go (edited for content, although i don't know how much they care):  well will  a creation by Andrea using the words of Matt Damon and Ben Affleck (it should be read aloud to some kind of artsy drum beat)  Chuck I had a- Do you feel like your- Chuck I had a- Alone, Will?

What do you have a fetish for swans or something? I want to be a shepherd. Ya Suspect! You were hoping for a goodnight kiss- Putting from the rough? I'm all about homeruns.  Do you feel like you're alone, Will?  Look buddy, two seconds ago You were ready to give me a jump! It's not your fault! I got some of your pickle!

      hmmm.  and so it begins.  i've got one and a half months left to squeeze the drippings of childhood out of my brain before I jump on a plane to New York.  Whether to submerge myself in my family or take the last moments for peace of mind and journaling...this is the question, horatio; i figure the more I write the better because I won't have much time once i hit grad school.  but not much is coming out.  karoliina and i are thinking of making some shorts.  I can't decide whether to script for those or finish the story for niall's liner notes.  Which is far too long now for liner notes, but still needs an ending.  Everything in it keeps leaning towards the ocean, as it always does, but i can't decide whether it should end there or face inward again.  current score on the BDI: 8 previous: 26 (?)  this is good, belive it or not.  Mandrea composed the most brilliant poem out of Good Will Hunting quotations.  I'll post it shortly.  lis.

      hi kids well if you've just arrived: i've put all my finished poems from my computer on here, so i could have them in one place to look at.  they're in a rough chronology (some very much out of place), so if you start at the bottom of this day and move up, you should be in relatively good shape.  or read whatever order you like.  directly below are the fragments.  none of my stories are on here.  next: napkin poems  lis.

      okay.  that is all of the finished poems.  the following are some fragments still on my computer:  1. everything disintegrates when i can’t find the stereo remote and the buttons on the interface of the actual electronic appliance are not sufficient to program this one desire i have which is to put that song that song which encompasses everything i feel about life and the world and my generation and especially the last six months which are really only a universal plague upon a nation of adolescents and our story is one story but they all have little nuances in their own chapters of reason and existence  it’s by a folk singer somewhere she came out of new york maybe except her drummer came out of california and the incorporation of hip hop means she speaks truth and so does he because everyone has their own rhythm which falls under the same the same... the same... bar chord  we don’t speak we only hum along with the static   2. romancing an early romance  she brings together all her keepsakes and cuts the ribbons off her love letters —rubs them in the sand—  forgotten.  all of this because once when she dove off a dock in the northeast -somewhere- the water was icy cold. it hit her through her ribs and shocked the breath out of her  that was romance, too the romance of solitude which she coveted like the thought of an album cover -singer staring out the window of his attic studio filled with music and bread- it was peace.  it was just another way to unface the face of solitude in the comfort of someone else’s posed loneliness  and surfacing when she hit the air steaming  because it was colder than the water soaking in she found that she could no longer tell the difference between her breath and sobbing  (though she doesn’t know why)   3. and i found beauty in the world through the eyes of a small willow tree. she stopped at my feet and looked down at me. i saw the strength in her branches and the leanness of her yew. her eyes were bright gold green. She looked at each thing new. when she looked up at me and saw what i don’t know to this day she caught my teardrop in her palm as if to say  don’t cry girl don’t cry  your feet are never planted you can run into the sun and then turn back again to see what you’ve begun  and i found strength in the eyes of that small willow tree.  she tasted my tears and saw my sadness hung before her on a sheet of rain. her hands brought out the many avenues running through my brain.  you’ve got it bad, said the willow tree. it sits with you and eats away at your heart. the worst part is that you cannot run away. No, I agreed.   Start with her, then, said the willow tree. start to look at it and love it again instead of the hate you’ve fallen into.  with who? with you.  and i found love through the eyes of a small willow tree then she gave to me a butterfly and told me to sing it to sleep   4.  Open up to me. Take out the little wall Which you have so solidly constructed Around your middle soft iron keep away keep away And let me feel The quality Of your skin. I remember it once When I touched it Before the wall was built newness warmth I fit we fit And I felt as though My hand  5.  on the slow road to recovery i remain in search of your history in trying to find myself i reinvent you while knowing all the while knowing i can’t catch up to what we once were  6.  “The Irish don’t have milk, They have whisky.”  That’s what Claire said when I called Ireland “the motherland” which is evidently Germany. We were talking about a poem in which the word “milk” appeared and she thought it was appropriate given that the translation was from German.  Funny.  Whiskey. I tried to think if I had ever had Irish whisky and I didn’t think so. Nor did I think that the amber colored liquid which so often fills my grandfather’s glass when he comes to visit was whiskey.  But then that was before I realized that “scotch” and whiskey were really the same thing.  This Thanksgiving surrounded by my Irish Catholic family (and I, proud because my grandfather always said I was the most Irish looking one of all 5 granddaughters) my mom said the blessing and we echoed amens and then Jenn said (jokingly) she was thankful that no one knew how to mix a long island iced tea because Sarah (sitting on my left, her youngest sister) who just turned 21  thus making it open to family discussion seemed to have a strong affinity for their taste and we didn’t want anyone getting too loopy this time around.  There was some laughter, and then my dad went in the kitchen to pop the cork on the wine I never noticed this when I was younger. Jenn doesn’t drink anymore because she says she loses control. Allison (the middle sister) says the same thing but she hasn’t really learned anything except that she can finish a bottle without much trouble.  I don’t know what to think about it because we never talk about that sort of thing talking is only something that’s done when we’ve had a few drinks to loosen our tongues except that I wonder what it is about our blood that craves whiskey and not milk   7.  love is accidental tripping on a crack in the cement a friendship finds its way out of the dark if you search for it it will disappear and you sail smoothly to nowhere off the edge but if you fall into it the ending dappled with grins and tiny imperfections can be rough with sweetness  8.    I spilt the medicine today— childproof cap pops off Thick viscous syrup (cherry red) pours off its tempered healing and stains all over blue wool pants. The sticky red gums my fingers together Red up underneath my fingernails Red scraped off skin Red sliced out from underneath skin Stained. I wipe it off and see a spot of scar tissue white on white holding back from the surface what once poured freely. There is a little left in the bottle.  I drink it straight down, letting it coat and heal from the inside.  You leave your glazed words at my door in a littlepile begging me to let it out again. I circumvent your requests though my artificial-colored hands leave their traces on the doorknob I am coated against your lies too muddy for them to stick or burrow their way in.  9.  june visit  Driving home among the brown hills past Deer Creek Road. Radiohead on the stereo.  The artificial green lawn of the stretch down Page Mill, where law firms, HP, and a small division of the Wall Street Journal make their home squeezed together with Sun Technologies and other Technologies all in a row.  A woman at a bus stop.  She is heavy, black.  The heat emits from the swollen folds of her ankles.  “palo alto how are you? i’m fine i’m fine how are you?”  Past the art film theatre, the Square on the corner across from the cell phone shop.  Which used to be an antique furniture store, through high school— or at least until the time I was 15.  After that it was A Zebra Copy store, and when that went we didn’t miss the man standing at the corner waving in his Zebra suit for people to come in. He always looked so uncomfortable. Now you can buy cell phones.  I can still remember the dust and spiderwebs in the antique store. They got so thick you could see their outline from the street.  Home to iced tea which my sister pours giggling “Ah, the sweet wine of the south.”  Mimicking our grandmother’s voice; touch of Alabama.  The “w”’s come out through the nose. I’ve never been there.  Nana says they have wet heat. We eat our watermelon in big smiling bites and wait for the pavement to cool off. Later, we might self-indulge with a night walk and reflect on the familiarities of weather.   that's it.  that's all of them.  this doesn't include my stories, some poems that niall and i exchanged in emails, and anything out of my poem journal.  but most of those are just fragments.  i only included the fragments that ever really wanted to be something; i don't think i write as well in my journal as i do other places.  there's that poem for sarah and eric but i'll publish that later.  the other two i'm missing are the napkin poems.  lauren has one and susie has one.  the rest of the series you will find as they go.  lis.

      kingship.  king me!  cried the boy his brown eyes staring just left of the sun. the woman placed a red atop his red crownside up.  i can rule the world, said the boy. you can rule yourself, said the woman. but the world is so big!  protested the boy. your mind is all the world, replied his companion. she pushed her black along a new square, out, ready for his jump. you let me? asked the boy. the woman tilted her head to one side, as though the thoughtful gaze required the brain to lean against its bedpost. i offered, said the woman. she leaned across to him, and noses almost touched. her mouth was very close, and cut upside down, like a scythe. his hands stayed very still in front of him. then he inched forward and studied the lines of her face. his fingers reached up and traced them. he sat back down, stolen treasures in his skin. now i know, said the boy. he lowered his gaze and looked at the ground, and saw shadows.

      please and thank yous  no i haven’t  been			writing 	she said glancing up at the clock which said it was half past the hour minus three minutes and that didn’t seem to make all the difference because she didn’t have anything to show it’s 		ALL	IN	HERE >touches forefinger which is slightly blistered from guitar strings to the side of her brow slightly sunburnt from a walk earlier that day along the resevoir upon which she saw at least eight rabbits and an owl  but i 	do	write			poetry youknow i	do		write sometimes.    no i haven’t been writing, she said. and in her head the idea that she was a hasbeen before she was ever somebody loomed frighteningly like a lightbulb in a bare room swinging back and forth in the genre of a film somewhere between a western and a crime scene “is that your poetry sitting there, like an abandoned child? when was the last time you fed it?  hmmm?” “GUILTY!  I PLEAD GUILTY!”   i only see it 				in little 		clips, you see. it flashes through my head but it’s usually when 	i’m driving or someplace without a pen. and then i just don’t have the time to write it all down and those ideas they pop up and shout at me and i continue to stare out the window but sometimes,  i do.  I do write them down, sometimes.  it doesn’t really bother me, anyway. what you think. that doesn’t bother me. i write for me.  hereliesonewhosenamewaswritinwater? what does that mean, anyway?  I think he was just trying to get attention.  and now have you 			been			there?  and seen that 		grave? there are CATS all over it.  CATS!  little cats.  it’s not important, see, the point is— it’s all about, the feeling... when i’m in that state of expression... what is it you’re looking for, exactly? yes.  yes i do, write poems, 				sometimes.  3.25.2002

      Julianne Moore  here the only mirth is in the sky. caught in little air pockets away from the sea and hands reaching.  here i touched her long braids which hung down soft shoulders covered in freckled skin. she smiled as the wind whipped a strand across her pale forehead and i saw a stretch of red running beneath the blond. so straight the wind takes the kink out of it it follows the lines of her frame down through her knees into the land.  In her, i see me. I see the way her hips round only slightly and her feet plant themselves sturdily in the rock. She laughs, and the wind laughs with her. it follows the curl in her tongue.  Here i find my hands awkward next to her slender fingers and my feet stumble while she walks strong and tall. My laugh is hollow and looks back at me puzzled as if it doesn’t know why it was let out in the first place.  her voice is never too loud.  my scalp feels tight and my face puffs out and i love her like you love a movie star behind glass mirror on her side and window on mine: dodging my own reflection.  1.21.2002

      soooo, apparently later on that day i thought i could save the world...   War Song  Four planes— all bent for here, California. 20,000 estimated, at least. They said. 300 firefighters. The first rescue squad is missing presumed dead in the second blast.  I can’t give blood because I’m too light I missed the cutoff. Oh just give me the needle, I can take it. I can take it. I won’t faint. Who cares if I faint? Christ!  Who cares if I faint!?  They look to him. They hold vigils and ask where the bloodshed should flow from.  It’s just like Pearl Harbor but much much worse much much worse  I can’t help but think of America’s choices then and a particular group of Americans who found themselves imprisoned in interment camps  but this boy has no father now did you hear me he has no father  Cup your hands together and breathe. Peek inside. there is a little ball of tranquility there it’s pause it’s peace  but W is calling for vengeance everywhere on our modern day radio and before we’ve even finished shedding our tears of disbelief we’re headed for what they call the long haul  oh my friends, for once, pause the politicians and let the poets speak!   								-sept 11th, 2001

      (no title)  it is confusing, the absence of a need for your validation. almost like it’s too easy.  what happened to the weight that comes with this?  i was taught through experience that all relationships are hard; a tug of war between feelings and who is the most expressive.  this love simply covers me like skin. i forget about it despite what it holds in; a new freckle will appear and i will look in the mirror with excitement a kid seeing her nose greet the summer months. sun-kissed.  it is too constant! it does not change only regenerates and grows with me as my bones expand.  i thought that love was like a cut.  Something open that needs to heal but when it closes up again it leaves you with a scar and a sting when pressed against cold memory: a distracting impression.  One that makes me forget the blueness of my eyes.  You make love so that it stays with me. Porous to breathe through; i do not suffocate in my skin— nor indestructible (if i cut this it too will bleed a little). If i kill it, it will erode slowly. And yet it covers me politely; lets me show my own muscle but encompasses me with infinite layer after layer of warmth and the uniqueness of my own handprints. I am not worthy of this gift! (and yet i am because we two together could make the muses jealous enough they would recreate snow to rival our beauty.)  12.23.2001

      Oh!  (the exclamation of losing something precious, she turns her face downward and weeps at her own foolishness of dropping this jewel into the pond)  then, a short intake of breath  (when she sees the beauty floating back up to her, carried on a delicate bubble of air)  she sees the strength of love in its fragility and snow falls lightly on her shoulders, crowning her hair she releases her former incredulity and tastes loveliness  12.23.2001

      ew.  i could write an ad for velveeta at this point.  oh lis.  fingertips  if i turn my hands so that the palms face upwards i see lines looking me in the face.  my hands have grasped the curve of one woman’s waist whom i loved.  and six others whose shapes did not age these lines but rather slipped along the grooves never pausing to examine the surface beneath them— a point of led stabbed into the base of my left thumb or the right angle i make for a handshake.  your hands have never known my sides or the pointed squares of my knuckles. your palms have never met the artificial lines i drew for myself running up my arms, or the length and straightness of my fingers.  i am not used to this kind of hope.  my hands have always been my own. no one could identify them they are not my mother’s or my father’s hands.  my mother’s grandfather had the same straight fingers but i never met him.  and i have always kept them in my pockets and held them away from touch in the daylight.  yet somehow i believe your hands seem familiar enough to link my fingers into and rest there in the space between where they will share strength and remain even. pressed together your hands give my palms room for breathing and i would like you to read them like braille—  with your fingertips  12.23.2001

      you have to read this one out loud for the rhythm, otherwise it's crappy.   serendipity  palming a pink shell found by the seashore the angel picks up her wings dusts out the grains from them dipping her toe in the warmest of waters she noticed the smell was different out here  tucking the shell in the fleece of her pocket she turns around swiftly to catch sight of a crab he scuttles out quickly and shakes his fist up at her halo she tilts it and looks at him sideways  then seeing the stretch of beach empty she looks around quibbling with crabs is no pastime of hers and she scans for companionship elsewhere behind the rocks sucking a breath in she tastes only salt  “where did the wind go” she calls up to the sky and it  rumbles with pleasure having just eaten but she hears no answer and frowning an angel frown she rubs her temples she has forgotten her name again     10.16.2001

      i think you've seen this one already...  Tuesday  Today seems stenciled. As if each word running across the page was its own, separate slogan spelled out in bubble letters still waiting to be filled. The woman in the coffee shop asks in her usual routine how I would like my mocha sized and glancing upward I notice her words like a character in a comic book floating in little bubbles above her head. Tall.  Grande.  Venti? It’s like that with everything today. An explosion of road signs and hollowed slogans, smacking me directly in the gut. The flashing bulbs around the name of a chain bookstore scream out to passers-by although their sparks have little to say in broad daylight.  It used to be a movie theatre before they changed hands, and I suppose they kept the front intact (now listing a permanent billing) to remind people of their city’s history.  I could easily find this offensive, but I don’t. Because it’s all still hollow no matter how loud it gets and nothing is worse than Yesterday (Yesterday was charcoal, all smudged together meanings in which I could not decipher the letters behind her eyes). Tomorrow things will still go unsaid. Tomorrow, I might overcome the fear of losing my voice in this mess and try to speak. I imagine it would be clear, and lasting, like a wine glass ringing— crystal. Tomorrow, I will duck my head, close my eyes, and think of silence.  10.9.2001

      Changeling  I start the day after my tacky choice of medium— the message on the answering machine. You were out.  Probably with the  pants and black leather jacket  about 5 foot 8 spiky black hair t-shirt that said “oui” in small white letters lanky posture but there’s no telling. You, after all, said the library.  What’s left to believe is in this new identity.  wash sheets throw out notes change cd new pajamas a haircut . Call up old lovers to let them know—moved on from moving on am enjoying my newfound independance life couldn’t be better tests to make me strong  stay up peruse poetry written with you in mind try to outline when this fissure opened 2:30 again can’t sleep still.  New day.  New afternoon. All smiles no stomach resolution not to let it in again.  Restart the ritual of rebirth. Place the key in its ignition and watch me drive away  I am shedding my old skin.  9.12.2000

      Coloring Book  the magnitude of everything has flipped. they are drawing lines for us everywhere to keep us safe from the unknown enemy of each other  I wrote to ask if you were okay and you wrote me back in a contraction an abbreviation and a period. “i’m okay.” no signature— it occured to me that i couldn’t even be sure someone hadn’t broken into your account because without signing it how could i know it was really you?  The world blew up and i don’t know when too early is going to be too late to amend this situation  I called him because you are a wrong number and he offered to loan me his coloring book.  I thought about it i thought about seeing that same book on your floor when he offered i thought about when you named it as his and my feet hit the floor though i was standing on the futon they became heavy and the bed collapsed  and still- the world blew up yesterday 							-September 12, 2001

      yes, i wrote a couple of these, too.  September 11, 2001  I sit on the steps of my sunny california home and watch a humming bird. He is the only thing flying right now in sight— no planes have passed overhead all day long. This unusual silence does not seem to affect him— he glimmers in the sunlight. His breast is shiny red metallic, almost and his back is dripped with green. He sucks nectar with a long, thin beak and darts his head from side to side quick, quick, then disppears from sight.  Behind me the television is still running everyone has forgotten our power crisis in light of more important newscasts— the twin towers are down. They have announced that these acts will not destroy our country that they can “destroy the steel of our buildings but cannot bend the steel of the american spirit.” They show the tower falling over and over people jumped from the building and then pictures of celebration in the streets of Palestine.  A representative of the Arab community in the Bay Area telephoned in to voice her concern —three hate calls already— they interrupted her for a breaking report, then apologized, though she was now off the air.  The president announces his intent of retaliation and everywhere while vigils are held in churches which hold faith that god will lead us to justice justice holds an angry grenade with empty shadows to launch at.  Because such a magnitude of suffering seeks suffering or justice cannot be served. We must not, let it be stated that we must not let justice go unsatisfied unsatiated nor let that grenade explode in our own hand.  The american spirit is the spirit of justice.  In new york, somewhere someone is crying into their cellphone quick, quick and through the shattered glass which hits the city like snow someone  is watching the beginnings of war.  I sit on my steps and wait for my friend to return. Tomorrow the country will wake up and feel sick to its stomach all over again but for now, in california— it is very quiet here. 									-sept 11th, 2001

      Ant Poem  a poem about nothing in particular: sitting quietly on the front porch i watch the ants go by they only crawl along the edge of our front step. *she is dead and gone, lady, she is dead and gone* i sit and, empty of any one thought, i lean over, my head between my knees, to follow their determined march with still sleepy eyes; *pray you, mark* place a finger in one little worker’s pathway and wait for the result of my unexpected obstacle. Will it be disastrous?  Will he lose  his footing, his pathway now blocked? No, he, dogged foot soldier, refuses to cease his journey.  First left, then right, then left again *And will she not come again, and will she not come again? No, no, she is dead* he turns himself in circles until perhaps a little dizzy this time he takes the higher route and goes around my flesh colored tree trunk picking up the trail *NO NO SHE IS DEAD* of his purpose and his queen.  I remove my finger, blink away the sleep from the corners of my eyes and marvel *she is gone, she is gone and we cast away moan* at the resilience of such a thing as an ant  9.1.2001

      Disappearance  This bookstore is familiar. Walking through its pathways I pause to examine a particular shelf. I have always been drawn to the poetry section. Almost no one ever goes back here. You always see them in (them being the other customers, consumers of the written word) the other sections; self-help or “our staff recommends”— or some brave souls pick through the fiction which covers the entire back wall but most prefer the open spaces at the front where everything is freshly laid out with gold and silver award seals on their covers. That way they can be sure to read real literature. I like it back here, in the shadows of obscurity. Nobody reads poetry anymore. This place is my place. No one can bother me here.  Looking up I notice at the tiptop of the highest shelf a set of Homer—the Iliad and the Odyssey. This too is familiar. Not because I have read either but because the same set once sat atop your bedside shelf (which was on my side, the left) and as I scan down I can see the patterns on the tapestry you draped beneath them. Purple I suppose still is your favorite color.  I look again and the jackets have all become that wine-stained cloth. Memory becomes dry mouth and I turn my back. Feet follow the carpet back to its more well-tracked surfaces, and I chuckle. Would you if forced to recall a letter or two of my name clothe your shelves in my bedspread of pale green? Or would you stay out here in the open spaces of now, leaving inky thoughts of then to the poetry shelf?  I shove a hand deep in the front pocket of my blue jeans and direct my feet to the magazine rack. After all, nobody reads poetry anymore.   9.1.2001

      Diesel Café, july twenty-fourth, 2001.  the minutes are ticking by everytime I look up at the digital clock in the corner it seems another number has fallen off but they are, they are and you are still not here  If only I could look into the future and know each moment what is going to happen from this moment out I would not have to wait around and live it out  The man playing pool across the room holds the back of his stick up high the cue ball makes its satisfying smack and he sinks the eight ball in the far right corner pocket my change in the far right corner there are three friends talking nodding in agreement over something important they lean forward in anticipation of the next piece to fit in to their analysis  I am  holding my breath again waiting you are not here and I want to know if the next game will be solids or stripes

      moss on a rocky lake bottom she looks at the minnows which swim around her feet.  You always got up to pee first and sometimes I went as an afterthought but usually I lay in thought of what it meant to you and how much I was missing until you came back   The stones are covered and the moss is wet and slippery the sand is darker around the edges like the rims of her eyes she spreads her hands out as if the air could break her fall and support her by the webbing between fingers   I once thought about leaving in the middle of the night. I had lain on the floor and waited for change. The dawn came. Still, I waited for change. You kept your eyes closed but cried out when you rolled over I wondered if that was for me.   She does not fall. Only hovers for a moment then passes her ankles back through the water a cold sting and rests her heels on the moss. The water is still shallow; it only comes up to her calves. She does not stop her flying game.  The day I knew what was wrong I walked out to the lake and looked down you drink your tea with lemon you drink your tea with lemon isn’t that right? I don’t remember  anymore his eyes are dark brown aren’t they if my eyes were a different shade of blue would you stay    She takes a step in deeper.  His hand matches hers the same size she feels him step in. It is almost like the water is filling in for her body and she is escaping into air; instead, the cognition of him pushes her into the lake bottom she is going to bury him in the moss.  I wish I could remember how I felt at 2:00 that afternoon; I know at 11:01 you called and told me to let go I hadn’t seen you for three days and when the receiver hit the base it made the loudest sound I had ever heard in those three seconds everything was just floating—   She plants her feet side by side in the moss. The water hits her knees. Suddenly, as though fate looked away and accident dropped in for a change her feet move beneath her and she falls on her back in the water. Her head hits  the rock jutting out of the water encircling her feet and she stops pretending to fly.    The moss is green. The minnows swim in little cliques too quick for the other fish to eat them. The rocks are orange and glow in the afternoon sun.   5.12.2001

      it will end soon i swear it will.   (no title)  I feel like my innocence has left me.  that day…that day that we sat by the pond like children with our sandwiches and our chips did you look at me and see a dark-eyed boy?  did you look down and see my grass-stained jeans cut loose around my hips …what did you see? was it me?  And that day…that day that we met skin on skin and your fingers reached down and parted me open did you cry out inside for your mistake? who did you see? Me?  Or rather…did you see your own reflection when you looked in my light eyes flecked with seaweed?  we hide from each other playing games in our wishing well little girls caught up  in our world of make-believe.  This only lasts until she says I am your own forever: then lifting the veil off my saltwater eyes you find that you delight more in an iago than an imogen— knowing that my skin is painted with your breath until you shut your mouth up taking words back in.  5.12.2001

      this is so weird.  is this a poem?  or did i just write with line breaks and think i was doing poetry?  whatever i did the pauses are worse than the language.  (no title)  i am raw on the inside and dull on the outside which is which is which when my insides are spilling over?  here i am standing considering death. where movement becomes stillness. When the torment of this redness spilling out from my forearms slows to a trickle then a drop pushing its way up out of a vein its driving force no longer pushing from beneath it swells, then gently rests its edges on white and considers a new, unchanging reflection.  3.22.2001

      sometimes, when you lack a title, and sleeping pills, you come up with the following:  Tuesday, October Tenth, Two-Thousand, Two-Fifty One A.M  I have become compulsive. This lack of sleep sweet pillow dreams once tasted now out of reach is getting to my head.   Suddenly I know that desperate secret of every person who has ever lost their mind. If I walk over to that pillow and touch it If i walk over to that pillow and lie my head there If I try to close my eyes and make the dreams come Your face will appear that face that I cannot let go of will hang over my eyelids and blister them, sweet memories turned to acid rain on my lashes seeping through my retinas and it is all on fire. Turn the lights on, off, on again, repeat the cycle for the twelfth time in hopes that you will leave. I scream.  It is slow, gutteral, starts from my belly and works up through my throat, out into the air. The bed mocks me with its invitation. It is now three am again and officially your birthday I would like to sleep to escape this moment but i am afraid of the dark and the dreams that seep in no matter how tightly i keep my eyelids closed.

      yeah okay that was a bummer of a day, wasn't it?   What is death like for the soul?  Paper cuts begin to take me home they heal my feeling. The edge of my keys is more real than the numbness behind this occasion of abandoned heartache. I feel the quiet center spreading in my limbs and over my synapses; I pick up the metal and it clinks against itself satisfyingly I know the door will stay unlocked.  Who is this now, leaving trails of charted lands upon my forearm?  The red squiggles are raised, showing new topography; here it dips into the river Nile which you named for me there it spreads out wings like five extended fingers a countdown to my days remaining. White caps the mountain ranges in my arm before it runs red back into the valley Do I wait?  Five more days?  Six more?  How long before I make this new land my America?  My map is getting bigger. Pretty soon it will extend up to my bicep; along my collar bone I will draw the world and all its landmarks The river will run down across my pelvis and the corner of my hip where your hand used to sit, water through my fingers.  That day, the ocean of my memory runs dry.   3.11.2001

      alison didn't like this one because i'm mixing my greek and biblical mythology.  i think it says something about my crazed psyche more than it does about my ignorance of religious myth.  (no title) an angel her wings are red. she looks down at her bare feet her naked back tickled with red tipped feathers the white stains weaving through from underneath a fallen angel she has been painted like Alice’s roses and she pads the ground with her feet like a Pegasus circling she folds her feathers in and weeps.  The jealous father Zeus ripped off her gown when she kissed the feet of Aphrodite  who laughed and brushed her forehead with pursed lips they burned and the angel felt herself sinking out of grace. “I love you.  I love you.” Aphrodite did not move or make reply. But even as the hand of Zeus began to lash open her back striking deftly the angel thought she saw that mouth which put on a glazed smile of happiness and love of its own beauty pass out of contentment and whisper “I love you too.” And then (is this me dreaming?) the angel thought she saw Aphrodite flinch salt water collected in the corner of her left eye as Zeus brought down his belt once more.  The moment passed. There was Aphrodite once again seeking Adonis in all his beauty desiring misbehavior while the angel her crumpled wings now bathed in blood picked up her loose feathers and limped into the forest, Zeus laughing from behind.  Torn and battered, the angel hearing the sound of laughter and splashing water made her way toward the center of the forest. Upon her arrival she saw their feet bare and tasting the coolness of the pool two muses Melpomene and Erato. Melpomene had pushed her mask up atop her forehead donning it like a jester’s cap and laughing with delight when it slipped back down molding to her face trying to spoil her secret joviality. Erato, enchanted by this peekaboo game, smiled as one blissful at the thought of her own truancy.   She leaned back on her elbows with her lyre resting against one knee threw back her head and let out a note so pleasing to the ear that even the angel shuddered with pleasure.  At the movement of her body she gasped, the blood still thick and red that poured out of her back her shoulders her sex where the belt had hit on its way back up for another blow. Erato jumped up. “What are you?” The angel could not reply.  She did not think there was a word to describe what she had become.  “Love” did not suffice.  “Cut off my wings,” she pleaded.  Erato motioned to Melpomene, who picked up her knife and approached the strange creature  lying there on the ground. Again, the angel made her request. Melpomene was afraid, but Erato seeing the blood pouring from between the angel’s thighs  leaned over and whispered “This will help you to forget.” then she took the knife from Melpomene’s hand and made her first cut deep, tearing the soft down and ripping into the muscle, until she pulled off the wings like leaves dropping them and marring the reflection they made in their own pool of red.  Everything was black. Then, slowly, the sky began to unbend before her and the angel awoke still breathing. She lay next to the clear pool which Erato had bathed her in to clean off her wounds before laying her again in the dewed grass. Craning her neck, the angel turned to observe the bareness of her back. But what she saw from the pool’s reflection  was neither clean white skin nor scars left  for memories of what had come before. Instead,  there were her wings grown back their new color pulsing and flushed, gleaming like the inside of a pomegranate, small streaks of white still marking what was left of her innocence.  “I only wish to forget!” she cried. “You cannot forget me,” said Aphrodite. And there she was, standing brightly over the angel, as though her full brown eyes might lift her up again though the angel knew this was only teasing. Aphrodite leaned over and, almost kissing an earlobe as she whispered, breathed out the explanation. “The hurt you have suffered in me must remain with you until you can accept the very nature of love which is loss.  When you accept that truth, then you can shed those wings from your back and embrace your solitude. Love cannot complete you. It can only deprive you of your whole. Abandon all thoughts of love and you will be happy.” She disappeared, and the angel was left her wings heavy her soul overflowing and her mind full of her memories.  an angel her wings are red. she looks back at the reflection of her blushing feathers still vibrant with their passion still heavy from their sadness she folds them in around her hugging her naked sides and, still weeping, cries out to the memory of her lover for release.  1.12.2001

      this is not quite so bad.  i kind of like it, in a "hey that's one of my 'not so bad poems' sort of way."  Oranges  The oranges we collected sit, complacent in their porcelain bowl blue, with white stripes circling its rim.  A crack in the bowl which has difficulty sustaining the weight of these oranges begins to open, working slowly from the inside out. The pressure eats away at the porcelain, pushing it apart. We have tried different fruit peaches,  apples, even grapes to fill the bowl but the heaviness of oranges seems to stay with it. I once tried to seal it up but the adhesive i used turned clear, revealing the stress again.  This time, i wonder if i simply tipped the oranges out let them spill on the floor bruising as they hit and sent this bowl crashing after them would we find new value in the broken pieces, their white circles now fragmented lines with a jagged edge?  2.21.2001

      sometimes, one needs to separate between poetry and journal entries.  (no title)  Once, Love leaned over and kissed me on my burning forehead soothing its afflicted surface. Now I am lying i am dying slowly draining your salve absent from my brows you pool together your vocabulary and extract all words but love then lock it in a safe away from my prying fingers.  How can one fall out of love? The absense of the glint the soft curve around your eyes held in a photograph not so long ago now you stare at me as if to say I fooled you look, the camera plays tricks.  Perhaps it was only the sheen  of the lens reflecting off your contacts. But I recall how your mouth parted and the word came tumbling out of you like breathing making the day ours.  I think sometimes you want to remember. I can see it come up in your throat your eyes and your chest look as though they want to burst with Love. But then you swallow  and it slides back down confined within a small blue capsule leaving me curious thinking about the reality projected behind photographs.  1.31.2001

      frankie didn't like this one much either, and i knew he wouldn't cos we both knew how bad it was.  (no title)  I have her hand in mine. Eight letters five poems and a few bruised hearts  (none of them mine) later she took my open palm and kissed it (soft mouth breathing quiet air on lined skin) because I offered so we made a fair exchange.  my muse figure the shadow of a love pinned up to my wall has stepped out of her cage and grown feet strapped on some ankle bones placed kinks in her knees which, bending, ease into hips turned outward a slight curve up and in, sculpted shoulder blades neck, ears, nose, eyes with lashes mouth that speaks  and demands reply ending my love affair with a blank page.  you lie crumpled in a corner a scattered alphabet of misinterpretation watching our reality with a dry mouth and I pay little attention—  her mouth is wet.  11.28.2000

      fish traffic  This is a race against time and i never have enough of it to navigate  the traffic in Boston is like thick schools of sardines flicking in and out you can’t tell one from another they all drive the same: blindly crazy  Sometimes the cars slipping on the wet roads rub each other the wrong way like rubbing your thumb on fish scales against the grain folding them back until they separate from the flesh and the silvery dust is left in the loops of your thumb print  this is like watching...  I am not the driver of this bus. I am a fish egg tossed about in the belly of a red and white striped monster who will spit me out at his will  I am at the mercy of the ted williams tunnel which seems to be the mating ground because everyone has settled and now they are flicking their tail fins on and off in some kind of ritualistic dance nose to backside nudging oh so affectionately  let me out I am through with swimming I need to fly  12.20.2000

      i totally remember writing this one.  awww.  swells.  (no title)  winter is crying on my carpet because i have left the window open  this is the first snowfall.  There is a cobweb in the bottom right-hand corner of the iron cast frame which holds in my glass view  now with the window open it has caught a shape in its thread this time a perfect star—   others stick to the glass freckles on the pane tiny icicle fractures they hang there to eavesdrop on my breathing.  The star is still there— i have never seen a snowflake this perfect almost a cutout  I want it to stay.  when you sang about winter did it remind me of this?   12.08.2000

      well, so november was a good month, as you can see.  this will only get worse.  it's for me more than anyone; if you get bored i won't be offended.  really.  Perspective of a Cannibal  I devour hearts. I eat them whole no pausing in between bites the juice runs red and raw down my jowls I dig in my eye teeth and tear away.  This is the confession of a cheater.  I betrayed you and you took me back hoping to conceal from us my true appetites  I loved you ever.  you left me today and I ran fleeing to my next course my throat still tingling from the salt of your most honest tears this course ran something other than reality  you will wait till i return for my second course of unabashed lustful friendship  11.16.2000

      the fact that i was directing hamlet at the time might have something to do with the title.   Remembrances  There is something about this This—what should we call it?— This something come too late that sits in my stomach and grinds away sifting out all urges leaving us with only words  In purple, in black, in blue there are your kisses, there are your touches there is my inspiration all in lower case to be tucked away in a drawer from the eyes of my current lover whose mouth fuels my speaking when she shares my breath  We must write out our love affair tucking in the flaps of our envelopes words never quite sealed leaking out my body recalls the absence of your palms resting I am caught under ink spots and pen out this impossibility with my tears  11.9.2000

      not sure when this was written.  early sept, 2000 probably.  (no title)  we were not built to feel but to act in this kaleidoscope of  a dreamland somewhere along the path i tripped and clutching pieces of the dreams the kaleidoscope fell on me cut the skin and i began to feel. It came out flooding the air with thickness and i grew gills to breathe. I am separated in the air that lies between those with gills (I breathe the air of feeling,  I am the only one i see) and those who know what they were built for. I forget how to breathe the other way. Watching you (sea turtle fins pressed up against the glass of curious faces in their cage rapping) i want to study lungs again and make this feeling  turn to air. Because it was nice to watch our lungs rise and fall in pattern with our breathing denying feeling and the only complaint was the heat of the afternoon which carried over into midnight I desire evolution   date?

      sigh.  well, i wrote it, i wouldn't publish it, but if i'm doing this properly i might as well put it all in.  the composition is what embarasses me, not the subject.  To S  I lack a lover. When you come to find me slip beneath my skin and dip your finger in what rivers flow there look in for a reflection and you will find a picture. This illustration will reveal all the secrets of my insides. They will dance in front of you, moving back and forth in waves of joy so happy to at last be let out of these veins.  It is a story which desires to be painted. How she, the villain, and I, the princess, met on a precipice of doubt where she offered me chocolate jewels which I sucked greedily too caught up in my fascination  of a valentine’s day gift to notice how heavy  the shell-casing of intoxication was pulling on my frame.  Those candied apples coated my mouth And stopped me speaking for a time. I found a knife and cut it open breathing in sharp air. Then I, shape shifter ever (and still afraid of my own model) shed my royal threads and donned the remote suit of a temptress.  Aloof, yet with an open mouth hell-bent on continuing my chronicles I encountered the photographer. She pursued me through her lens and I did my best to comply blushing at the orange tulips left in my doorway their bell-shapes drooping slightly towards the ground tearing off clothes behind a half-opened door to rip into the reflected image. She sometimes pointed the lens at me For which I tried very hard to look natural and not muster the illusion of being photographed off-guard. Then one day she asked me how I would best describe myself and my particular feelings surrounding a particular subject delicately euphemized to which I replied, “I don’t really like labels.” She took her camera south soon after that and I (carefully avoiding the full length mirror on my closet door) began to rifle through my wardrobe.  Return to the moment.  Read my skin. The veins press outward over sinews running the length of my fingers and delegate my history to a careful diagram of this now absent cast. I want no misinterpretation of my laugh lines nor any assumption that my handwriting has always looked this way. So back again.  I will speed through the third though she was perhaps the most important she made me half a musician and then left me feeling naked throwing the art of honesty back in my face and now listens with a distant ear occasionally when I sing her praises.  Now I have dressed myself in easy fitting overalls chopped my hair uneven so it hangs down to hide my eyes and let my quiet half surface. You call it my boy handwriting And squeeze my thin sides laughing at my squinted expression. You are careful and seductive and aloof and unexpected. I am buried under pen and paper channeling what I have to keep away from the touch of your fingers and their capacity for understanding into broken words about my history because I am not ready for  you to disappear  in it. You tread on the changeling heels of my past, bringing your own paintings and brushes, your own approach to this art. We sit side by side, open to interpretation and I remember why I set my history, but not my desire down on skin.  10.21.2000

      this one goes with the one below.   Love Letter  I have a letter of yours in my drawer. It lists, in order all of the reasons you cannot love me. They are neatly numbered, lined up like soldiers, ready for the battle, Ready aim fire. Like today’s to do list, tacked up smoothly your round letters work through the argument no punctuation other than the period. I cannot love you.  Full stop. How easily this is said!  With such simplicity and clarity! And it all makes such perfect sense except for those lines in which you talk about how much you love me anyway and still end it all with a period. I have traced over your sentences, and frankly I think it might be more appropriate to utilize —In certain instances, that is, of feeling— a question mark.  Especially since you so meticulously presented the summation of your rejection of me without even pausing to consider that your reader could get tired without a comma here or there. Perhaps you should offer it to someone with a more objective view, who could revise it, play the editor, and show you how to drain your emotion so it does not inhibit your writing skills. I would offer, but am no editor. I am simply the addressee.  10.16.2000

      a photograph i own.  4 x 6  Looking at what used to be Never can get us back there. This image of your laughter has been dried of sound and flattened out, shrunken, pasted on a wall so I don’t forget what laughing looks like. So that I don’t forget when I listen to the hissing sound of dead air on the telephone dull electric  what it was like to hear music from your mouth. I cannot make this picture sing.   10.7.2000

      Rubbernecking this poem was about a drive back from seattle.  it never really worked.  frank bidart never liked it much and i kind of thought it was better by the third revision, but i might have just rewritten it to death.   Rubbernecking  Blue is the color of the plastic sheets lying on bruised pavement reflecting shadows cast by bright orange flares. The truck is overturned And the tires of our little green car kick up its smashed bits as we pass shattered glass the police have not yet cleared. It falls about the windshield tapping on our doors asking to come in, then bounces off and rests next to the blue bulges at the cop’s feet now ten seconds behind. A big accident.  There are two ambulances their lights flashing, but no sirens.  No one visible to survey the crash but the police one sitting in his cruiser, filling out the paperwork that comes with this sort of thing The other standing over the remains of the scene waiting for an attendant, an EMT to come out of the quiet ambulance and retrieve the three figures he looks down upon.  I look out and recognize the car. We had kept our distance, pulling over to let him pass out of sight and out of mind. Those small headlights only an hour ago swerving staggering, stuttering under the touch of the driver’s loose and flimsy fingers dancing between the white lines as we followed now lay still underneath the truck’s heavy grid. Flipped out of time.  Out of motion. It is three a.m. and the sight of this makes my stomach squeeze desperate to unleash its contents and my hands shake underneath the blue tinted lights from the highway I tell you what I saw. Your eyes grow wide—“I knew it, I knew that guy was drunk.”   And then you talk about how glad you are we stopped because God, what if? You turn the radio up again, satisfied with your narrow escape and the gift of this life. You did not see the three blue bags lying side by side. Sights to come in my memory my dreams, now shaping my lullaby. Would you say “us” if you had seen death too? Would you sleep?   10.19.2000

      okay wait the improvements: i ate chocolate chip pancakes. emailed a bunch of people back that i owed emails. then found tootsie's website which she has updated.  there were pics of her, drew, alicen, where she lives, people in her program, descriptions of the mission...everything...it made me so happy to see all of it.  i miss toots like crazy and i haven't heard from her in a long while, which is a little sad.  but to see everything was so wonderful.  if she ever gets my letter and writes back i'll be supremely happy.  i can't find her email offhand, though... then susie called and oh i NEEDED to hear from my best friend just then, and she called and that was superb.  she is in boston which is not new york but still close and that's better than san francisco and london  i am in supreme need of a shower right now so i will go do that why is it so cold???  lis.

      can't stay with alison.  can't stay with jess.  can stay with morgan but morgan's not there.  this gets more fun by the second.  all i want is for someone to meet me at the airport, take me in a cab to my new apt, and say, oh, by the way, i picked up a bed and dresser for you, and signed all your health/loan/lease forms, and this journal wants to publish your story, and they've invited you to stay on for a Ph.D. because they recognized your brilliance from your entrance essay, and oh by the way i'm putting a production of midsummer on, would you like to play bottom?  is that too much to ask?  crimminy.  i hate it when people are cryptic and i don't know what they're talking about.  it sucks you in it sucks you in it sucks you in  hi.  if you are my friend, you need to write me now, so that i feel loved.  because at the moment i feel unloved and homeless.  mom is making me chocolate chip pancakes that is a little bit better  lis

      set me alight we'll punch a hole right through the night everyday the dreamers die to see what's on the other side she is liberty and she comes to rescue me   thinking...i was driving down 101 out of the fog of san francisco (where i spent my weekend; all i can say is i suppose the shennanigans are worth the lung sufferage, in fact i'm certain they are) and had U2 on.  They were my favorite band up until senior year and then the new album did something to them for me; i loved it and then i associated it with unpleasant things and began to hate it, and i haven't, to tell the truth, listened to it since.  not fully.  even though i love that opening on "new york" and a beautiful day is a lovely song.  it really is.  it makes bands tighten but it still retains its loveliness.  but i had the joshua tree in, thankfully.  so much of this did not come up.  i settled into the comfort of the old albums and my favorite irish quartet and oh, erin ford, i missed you so very desperately.  all i thought of was us in blanchard's car (i think it was blanchard's) on route 9 talking about the release of the new album and how you were so tan and your eyes so very big and bright and you had little pigtails in.  i have a photograph from that day.  it was sunny, and green, and nothing terribly wrong had happened just yet at wellesley.  i was 19 and happy.  we might've gone to see a movie; i'm not sure what.  and then i thought about freeways and the woman with the rainbow belt whom i passed and the ambulances and fire trucks and police cars on the other side of the divider; glad i wasn't going that way; a little sick at what might be on the other side i thought about driving back from seattle with lindsay and how horrible it was to see the accident i thought about stuff.  and it's funny cos i think my only private memories are on freeways really driving on freeways i suppose i'm raised a californian so it makes sense but i don't know.  i thought about driving on the other side of the barrier, where all the traffic still is just now and listening to bjork (her new album had just come out and i listened to it a lot that fall) on my way to poetry class.  and thinking that those moments were my new memories, and that they were just mine despite the edge  how different is it now?  the pike.  massachusetts on a hot day; on a snowy day; early (so very early) in the morning.  daylight barely covering our gloved fingers.  cold breath you can see inside the car.  playing raquetball.  laughing at her tattoos.  the wipers needed to be changed on the car; where's the camera?  tupe's point was too windy and she poked at my stomach muscles with her elbow until we left.  a good weekend.  really bloody cold but a good weekend overall.  open rooms with bare floors are an investment in new memories  dj played me the jurassic five and men on motorcycles outside peering in the windows what was with the bathroom?  katie can't go outside without her agent  i'm tired i need a nap new york is in one week and three (or so) days it would be nice to have a place when i get there...sigh... yes, a nap.  lis.

      evil. my stomach today is.  yoda?   so i'm feeling a little under the weather (suddenly and unexpectedly.  fever etc; i hope it will be gone tomorrow) and I find this fretful.  I fret.  I do.  fret fret fret.  alternatively, i am so so hungry.  but if i eat anything my body gets quite angry with me.  "is morgan's apt across from a turntable lab store?"  i wonder as i aimlessly surf the net in hopes that my intestinal system will calm itself.  got pics back today.  The pics from grandpa's birthday reveal that Ted, being not quite two, is incapable of keeping his face clean. oh, little edward, when will you graduate to long pants? the beach photos are less than flattering.  ew i hate that bathing suit.  maybe i should buy one that fits, and not rely on the fall back from seventh grade.  i never seem to get motivated for bathing suit season.  bummer.  it probably doesn't help that i was hanging out with ms. olympic athlete caroline, who was all tanned from france.  why didn't she inherit the irish skin?  where did she come from?  i'm telling you.  adopted.  i know that whole "you were dropped off by the police" thing i keep telling her is a joke but i'm starting to wonder if they switched the kid in the hospital.  i don't care how much she looks like me.  she's BLOND.  i'm soooooo hungry but i'm not i think i'm just bored  my hairdresser asked today if i had been dating at all.  i was like...wait, dating?  what's that?  is that where you go out with someone and do things and then maybe get a smooch at the end of the night?  i've heard of that.  right.  i think the last person i technically "dated" would be hartley.  which is the last person he heard about, which was... when was that? april.   right.  april.  i think that would also be called a whirlwind fling of a week rather than "dating."  hoser.  now *she's* going to france.  why do all these people get to go to france?  i want to hang out at the musée d'orsay for like a week.  that would be cool.  living off of graham crackers and grape juice.  maybe some nutella.  oohhhh. graham crackers.  now back to this dating thing for a second...why is it i had a fairly active social life in the dating world when i was damn depressed and pathetic and (oh that's right skinny, hello ass i suppose you missed me, but i didn't miss you) couldn't stand on my own two feet?  and now i'm like superwoman, fuck that i'm fucking emma peel from the avengers baybee, diana rigg in a jumpsuit (the blue and white one), and now the prospects are not only absent, but i don't really seem to mind? cos it's more fun to be diana rigg in a blue and white jumpsuit when you and steed are "just friends" than it is to have to deal with melodrama and sound like an asshole.  i hate it when i date people.  it sucks up all my time and just causes way too much trouble.  and besides, i think i probably appreciate how hot i look in a jumpsuit more than steed. or something.  you know what i mean.   i HATE "to be" verbs.  they rot the face of literature.  more specifically, they rot my potential for joining the english canon after i die.  i wonder if there's anyone in the world *named* graham crackers.  there IS NOW.  bwahh hahhahahhah (sic)  lis.

      i'm a little bit restless a little bit heiress a little bit irish  the first bit was mine.  yes.  restless.  would be the word.  but it will be okay.  i really hope morgan's not too mad; i didn't mean to piss her off.  i do wish she would understand my position a bit better, though.  it's not exactly easy jumping into school when a person has no definite place to live, you know?  and i know she's doing all she can, but sitting 3000 miles across the country waiting for something to happen is not the easiest thing.  it makes you feel helpless and a little bit frightened.  sigh.  ok.  onward.  walked around for like an hour just now because i had to get out of the house.  and now my hands and feet are grimy and sweaty and it's quite gross but i suppose we can't always have perfection especially not when you're wearing pants and it's hot out why did i do that, again? why don't i just change? cos in about two hours it's going to get really cold really quickly and then i'll just change back.  michelle was funny today.  she was like "oh!  i'm not ready for you to go!  I've gotten attached!" and i was like "well i can write, you know."  silly therapist.  i think i know i'm done though.  i can talk for literally like half an hour and then i feel pretty much done; it used to be our sessions didn't feel long enough, and now i'm scrabbling to find something to fill the last 20 minutes.  aside from my housing issue i'm a-okay.  my psyche has sorted itself out, i guess.  oooh.  chocolate.  you are painting thoughts with lis.

      here's what's true: 1) i had a filthy mouth this morning.  i apologise for the frequency of my curses.  it was an upsetting interaction.  2) i didn't really cry, if anyone was concerned about it.  sometimes people take me literally.  and i think, why did you do that?  but they keep doing it.  3) harry and deese crack me up because i just got these from my old email:  Here are the results of the Funniness Survey sent by Kate on Jul 18 2002 7:07PM.  You scored a 9.5! You are Humoriffic!   The aura of humor surrounds you so completely that you cannot walk down the street without everyone pointing at you and laughing hysterically until urine pools at their feet. Your sparkling wit and breezy sense of humor are unparalleled, and everyone loves to be around you to hear what you will say next. Congratulations on your great sense of humor  katie got a 9.3.  and poor deese, with her 2.5—  Kdog tells extremely unfunny and corny jokes.  Kdog is the funniest-looking survey taker.   awww.  deese.  sad.   i think she got upset though, because then we got a second result and i'm convince that deese rigged it cos the opposite happened.  she was really funny and harry and me, not so much.  yeah uh huh.  i know what's goin on.  in other news:  Here are the results of the Drinking Survey sent by Kate on Jul 18 2002 7:26PM.  You scored a 6.2! After Several Drinks, You do Something Stupid   Sure, you might not take your pants off and start singing off key after just a single drink, but after a few more you tend to stumble into things and sleep with anyone who makes eye contact. You have average alcohol tolerance: you can have a few drinks at a social gathering without making a fool of yourself, and just down a few more whenever you feel like doing something retarded. Congratulations on your average tolerance!  Notes Most people have seen Kdog wasted.  It takes Ed only 1 drink to get wasted.  After a few drinks, Kate is usually prancing around naked.  Kdog has woken up with the most survey-takers naked after a night of drinking.  So what i'm thinking is, my perceived tolerance has not changed.  hmmm.  we'll have to work on this.  at least i'm not the free and easy drinker in the notes.  noooo nudity for me.  nope.  none.  this is your one beer queer signing out  lis.

      6000 words and still no end in sight.  do i have an idea, or what is this?  i can see them in my head.  they are so real, this girl and that girl and the boy and the river and the earth.  the tree is real and the sea across the woods is real, and their backs are real and i know the way his hair curls about his ears, and the way hers falls straight down her back, and the way hers falls into her eyes so she doesn't need that mask...i see her ears and her expression and their voices and hands.  i know it all but just because they exist i suppose doesn't mean they *do*, i mean as in act.  i have them, i just want them to do.  they keep thinking too much.  damn them.  get out of your italics and back into bold, you shoddy little players in my mind.  lis.

      hello loves.  in my last blast attempt of the summer to finish keats i have become my own professor and set reading deadlines.  It's working wonders.  i don't know why i didn't think of this before.  page 350 of Bate and yesterday afternoon it was only 230 (i suggest anyone who thinks i'm a slow reader go and trudge up this book, and find that not only is it 1 1/2 times the size of a normal quarto, or however they fold them these days, it has a ton of teeny text in it, in the form of pulled quotations from the letters.  Bollocks to speak and spell, then).  All i have to do is pretend i have a 1:30 keats class with Alison Hickey and lo and behold, my brain kicks in.  which means i have an hour to finish this, take a shower, and read 15 pages.  whoa.  pieces, bella, pieces.  unless you have any interest in hearing me reiterate my thesis and/or hearing a particular dislike of mine for Nabokov's egotism, the next bit will bore you silly, as it's my posing academic spilling over.  I picked up The War Against Cliché by Martin Amis and discovered this:  "Oh yes.  And Shakespeare.  The fact that Shakespeare should have been, of all things, a *dramatist* is one of the great cosmic jokes of all time — as if Mozart has spent his entire career as second wash-board or string-twanger in some Salzburg skiffle group.  (It is also a deft confirmation that Shakespeare is an exception to every conceivable rule.)"  Those were Amis's words.  This from an essay on Nabokov, who apparently said: "The most popular plays of yesterday are on the level of the worst novels of yesterday.  The best plays of today areon the level of magazine stories and fat bestsellers." here Amis picks up with: "And the reasons for this are obvious too— the fatigue and artificiality of dramatic conventions, together with the insidious reliance on market forces (and just *look* at those market forces, out on Broadway and Shaftesbury Avenue).  Kicking off with Aeschylus, Nabokov conducts a murderous parade from which very few individuals escape summary court martial.  Chekhov, Gogol maybe, some Shaw, a little Ibsen, and that's about it."  Now stumbling across this after being immersed in Keats was almost a complete turnaround...I was somewhat astonished at the dismissal of an entire artform based on 'market forces' on Amis's part...then it dawned on me after a reread that he was (like everything else he writes) probably being quite sarcastic.   But what really surprises me, and tell me if i'm wrong, do, is despite the sarcasm about Nabokov's i assume rather failed attempts (did anyone know he wrote plays?  hmmm) at theatrics, and the fact that Amis i *assume* is chiding him for his dismissal of theatre, is that nabokov actually did dismiss it.  I haven't read the entire text of Nabokov's, but even the sound *bites*; how can you make such a broad spanning judgement?  This is what I mean about theatre, about plays.  They are great because they exist in a moment.  A production is a living, breathing animal, which could rage out of control at any second.  The beauty in it is that it exists only for the duration of three to five acts, and then the curtain releases the tension...a good play is like watching a piano hanging above the head of a innocent bystander, with no real knowledge of the thickness or the durability of the wires holding it up; all you know is they are taut.  The release comes with either survival or seeing the wires snap but not the death; it's not the actuality of the thing but the anticipation.  A bad play is, and andy warhold will forgive me no doubt, like watching the film of someone sleeping.  You keep expecting something good to happen in hopes that otherwise the film would not have been made.  A quarter of the way through you realize there was no point in its creation and the whole thing becomes depressing.  But how is this any better or worse than the novel?  I think it's more exciting, myself; the idea of so many inputs at once with the possibility of something astonishing or something horrid is what keeps us there.  It escapes me how you could think the entirety of a play's worth could be gleaned from the text...even shakespeare's.  I have an idea as to why Nabokov thought that, though...if you look at his novels...i know he was all open to the idea of outside influences and possibilities beyond what we recognize but as an artist he was very much invested in control of his art form.  Pale fire is something of a paradox for me because he implies influences beyond the writer's (or kinbote's and shade's, at least) control but then places himself in particular images as one of those influences.  I am always heavily aware of his authorial dictatorship, if you will.  And somehow i think i'm missing the point, but that's why i find it paradoxical.  The strings of control are meant to carry beyond him, i suppose, if you take his point wholeheartedly, but it doesn't for me erase the puppetry he sometimes inflicts upon his characters.  You simply can't do that with theatre.  If you want to talk about an allegorical life (thesis rears its ugly head, i'm sorry), i don't think the man lived it.  If shakespeare was our greatest dramatist, and one of our greatest poets, i still believe the reasoning is in hazlitt and keats...i'm more a Romanticist than anything, i guess...  "The striking peculiarity of Shakespeare's mind was its generic quality, its power of communication with all other minds—so that it contained a universe of thought and feeling within itself, and had no one peculiar bias, or exclusive excellence more than another.  He was just like any other man, but that he was like all other men.  He was the least of an egoist that it was possible to be." (hazlitt, on shakespeare and milton)...and then following Keats's ideas on the poetical character "it is not itself—it has no self—it is every thing and nothing—It has no character—it enjoys light and shade; it lives in gusto, be it foul or fair, high or low, rich or poor, mean or elevated—It has as much delight in conceiving an Iago as an Imogen" (To Richard Woodhouse)  I think this is how I can place my finger on what it is I dislike about Nabokov and what it is i adore about Keats's ambition...an ambition towards such abandonment and anonymity...i know what Stephen Greenblatt said in his lecture at Wellesley last fall about Shakespeare coming out through Autolycus might contradict this a little, but i think the best part is that it seems more accidental than anything, whereas Nabokov seems to me purposefully hidden.  He plays hide and go seek with his readers, with his characters, and everything comes out "genius"...well anyway.  just thoughts.  Again, i probably only bit on this one because it disagreed with my entire thesis...and the idea that shakespeare could only achieve what he managed through the medium of dramatic art, because poetry was too self-aware (as it became for Keats, but he managed it differently...well i won't get into it).  Of course there's the possibility that Nabokov was joking and I missed it.  Amis i'm a little uncertain about; I assume as a critic he's more mindful than, even if it is 1985, to throw out theatre as a cliché; but for the most part he respects Nabokov and doses him with more praise than the rest of the "war against cliché" does for other writers.  He ends the essay with "He had better things to do: dreaming up Humbert Humbert, for example, and all his sound and strong opinions...." which i would think tips you off to Amis's tone if you missed it the rest of the way through.  Which i think i did the first time around, but i was so incredulous as to what i was reading it was difficult not to get ainsy.  plus i was reading it in the car with caroline singing in my ear, and mom yelling about the butterflies we had to drive through again.  oh hell in a handbasket, i'll never get it right.  lis.

      meeting new people is always an eye-opener to me.  i recall that the pocket of names i know or have met does not shade the rest of the world; that while some people have made it into my top five and others remain at arm's length, there is always room for a top ten. and when I meet someone who breaks a silence with: "so have you tried the garlic balls?" it reaffirms my faith that i am not alone in my weirdness.  L.A. has too many freeways.  I have also noted that when in southern california and one is only native by birth, and not by habitation, putting "the" in front of all of one's freeways can get a little tiresome on the tongue.  there are now five books sitting on my bed and i have to read all of them or i might kick myself.  italo, however, assuages my pains:  "...however wide-ranging any person's formative reading may be, there will always be an enormous number of fundamental works that one has not read."  i feel this applies to art in general.  as my ears have not soaked up everything in the pool of sound, nor my eyes eaten enough celloid to feel that dessert is coming.  today: i have a theory about collective memory, and why theatre is one of the greater art forms in existence.  something like live unrecorded performances by buckley.  if i ever finish that story, i'll figure it out and write a new thesis.  could somebody get me some hazlitt?  gracias.  lis.

      we drove through butterflies.  a mass exodus of butterflies.  some missed the windshield and some were not so lucky.  my sister was shrieking.  mom just kept saying "i'm sorry, i'm sorry!" but still laughing because they were only butterflies, weren't they?  because what could she do, avoid them?  There were thousands and we were on I-5 and it was a monday, which meant trucks.  and all the while i couldn't think of anything besides Pale Fire lying in the trunk and wondering if i had somehow summoned this flight of insects to a death of being splattered on my windshield, through the works of an old pen.  there was a green and yellow one.  most were yellow but one that lodged itself between the wipers was a pale green, like my blanket at home, a yellow dollop on each wing, the upper halves.  it was a beautiful thing.  i am possessed by an inarticulated fear of late.  a black hole sucking up someone i love.  i just have to stand and watch it and sigh.  oh i miss her.  i think i knew it was happening but i kind of had no choice.  the one-up.  the ever present fear of being one-upped by past followers.  i don't want my road overtaken.  i want it marked out clearly, with sidewalk chalk and small twinkling lights and arrows pointing "this way up."  Not the road not taken, no because i hate frost and i will always hate frost and it's not because he's done anything wrong in particular it's just that suddenly i know i'm in a sea of people all trying to be something from a past article and i don't want that, and if i let frost tell me then i'll follow his stupid road, won't i?  i want to walk out into the sea and i don't want anyone to know i've done it but me.  and then later, maybe, when i know what it is i've done, i can open the door for broader vision.  it's like an eggshell around my world.  the last thing i need is for someone to let the yoke seep out of it so they can put their own paintings along its side and say they got there first, when i built the foundation.  too much comparison and that is what undoes you  lis.

      i was up to tuck the streetlamps in this morning.  no reason, except for that friggin squirrel outside my window.  damn that music.  so i woke up (funny, it's now eleven, about the time i got up yesterday) at 6:30, went running, got back at 7:20, took a shower.  used the rest of the milk.  carrie came in about 8:15 or so.  "Where's the milk?" "hahahhahahahhahahahah" "..." "i drank it." "i need my granola." "so go get milk." "YOU go get milk." "but—" "GO GET THE MILK GO GET THE MILK I WANT MY GRANOLA GO GET THE MILK GO GET THE MIIIIIIIILLLLLK"  i went and got the milk.    and some cherries and apples and carmex.  ahhh, carmex.  then carrie spent like an hour throwing empty crystal geyser bottles into the dishwasher as i was emptying it and going "WHY ARE YOU PUTTING PLASTIC BOTTLES IN THERE??? THAT'S FOR RECYLCING!!!"  and then i cleaned the house.  isn't life thrilling?  ed.

      word.  today has been a funny day. i woke up at one cos carrie and i were up so late swapping stories (see below for hers, and i think you get enough of my business) and read a few stories in my recent stack of the new yorkers.  which is never ending.  and then i went and spent two hours writing birthday/other cards, a task with which i am still not done.  but many of you can look forward to your overdue notes in the mail.  and now i've come home.  and i got the wellesley magazine in the mail, and had a bout of nostalgia, and wanted to cry my eyes out i miss things about that place so much.  and then i missed people, and then...  then i disengaged.  cos that's what i do.  now i'm just sitting here wondering about thu's poetry and if certain things are worth trying for anymore and realizing that sometimes, no matter how hard you try to be honest and open and welcoming, not everyone is as genuine as you would like them to be.  And not everyone will try as hard as you do.  there's this little niche i'm still sitting in, not because it's my niche mind you but because i'm still perched there for lack of a better place to sun myself.  and i think my butt's getting a bit numb.  i guess it's one of those moments where i wish i had withheld, and then i remember that i can't, cos i'm not like that, and if i was it would be a game, wouldn't it?  many thanks to pete for his words today.  it cheered me to have a full mailbox, and i too am counting the days.  at the moment i'm in my dad's office, and there's something about the smell of these books, which stretch from floor to ceiling.  i always wished i could curl up comfortably on the carpet and read all of them, one by one.  it would take me years.  but it's comforting, the idea of disappearing into a world not your own for that long, and hoping the rest of the world will have changed when you come back out.  erin cozens, i miss you!  lis lis

      i couldn't resist.  this needs to be documented.  a brief encounter of the carrie kind, or a trip down memory lane...  when i was little, at kids' corner after school, this one time i got really mad at the teacher.  so i threw one of the markers out the window and stuck the other orange one up my nose.  then eric came over and started screaming "take that marker out of your nose!"  and i yelled back "no! i won't!"  "but you're gonna get high!"  "i don't want to!  it smells good!"  we spit in molly's cookie.  she was holding katy's hamster and it bit her and she promptly threw it across the room.  it hit the wall and died.  so the next day at lunch, we asked if she wanted an oreo.  i opened it and spit in it and then gave it to her.  heh heh.  when i was in kindergarten we were fingerpainting, and i was doing all these weird things with the paint.  and then elizabeth came up and said "that's not how you fingerpaint!" and i got up and screamed "they're my fingers!!!" and then i waved my hands at her, like spirit fingers.  then eric, my teacher, told me not to be evil with the paint.  during the parent's night, all the parents could see their child's drawings on the wall.  There were lots of bunnies and flowers and things.  I was the only kid who painted nuns on the run.  One time this girl was eating her banana, and i started yelling "it's a scary movie!!!" cos it was so disgusting.  then they made me go talk to my teacher at lunch.  Alison and I used to be the eraser cleaners in fourth grade.  one time we went out and after cleaning the erasers, we were having a chat and the plaster started falling off the ceiling onto the table.  Lucy came out and said "i see you girls have been doing more than cleaning the erasers!"  Then she tried to get mad at us, like *we* had made the ceiling fall.  After that i asked to go to the bathroom and katy and i made spit wads and threw them on the ceiling for half an hour.  okay the best day, the funniest one i ever did, was in fourth grade.  Ms. wells was the stupidest woman ever who had this big space in between her teeth.  every time she smiled i laughed hysterically, because gina had watched grease too many times, and you know the toothpaste commercial where they start going "brusha brusha brusha make your toothies minty" and it's a beaver?  well ms. wells looked like the beaver.  and everytime she smiled gina would go "brusha brusha brusha" and make the brushing motions.  Ms. wells thought i was hyperactive cos i laughed so much.  i didn't like her.  also because she wore the ugliest cordoroy green jumper i had ever seen.  anyway so she was reading that roald dahl book...the tales of henry sugar...what is it?  The wonderful story of henry sugar.  I didn't really understand it, cos it was bizarre, and she couldn't read out loud well, so i stopped paying attention.  I would fall asleep and when i woke up henry sugar would be talking to some guy from india about playing cards and it was so boring i thought i was going to die.  i seriously want you to know that i wasn't always this bored in classes i just really did not like that book.  i didn't really get that it was different short stories so it all just ran together and i didn't get the point.  i really hated it and i told people this.  i would lean over and say cole, do you like this book?  and he would say "what?" cos he really never paid attention.  okay so it was one of those afternoons that was really pretty, and all the other kids were outside or had left.  i hated being in classrooms where they put you by the window and you could look outside and see what you were missing.  i spent hours, literally hours looking out the door.  to me every day that i was in elementary school was a beautiful perfect day that i was missing, i could have been outside playing with water ballons but no, every afternoon i was trapped with henry sugar.  so once again i was listening about the man in india.  i decided that since i didn't like the book, i didn't like mrs. wells, and she was only our friday teacher so i didn't care what she thought of me cos i only had to see her one day a week, that i would test a theory.  She was one of those people that held the book really close to her face.  I wondered if she could see flying objects.  I took out my binder, and folded some pieces of binder paper and ripped it in half silently (i licked it first on the crease).  So i started wadding up this paper so it was sort of dense, and i threw it across the room.  *interlude from me* wait, you didn't get in trouble for this???  no.  and i'll tell you why. the tables were arranged in an L shape and i was on her right, at the bent part of the L.  I figured i wouldn't hit anybody and everyone else was asleep anyway.  and i didn't want to fall asleep cos it's embarassing to fall asleep in front of other people.  so i threw it across the room and she didn't notice.  and i thought, "this is so funny!"  so then, after a couple of shots across the room, i decided to get a little closer to her.  so i threw it not totally across the room, so it landed like, two feet away from her.  she was so absorbed in the book though, that she still didn't notice.  so i started tossing them over.  some of them hit the stool.  now people were noticing.  i almost got caught when people started chuckling and she looked up and said "please be quiet you guys."  but she still didn't notice.  so i figured it was safe to proceed.  cole had taken a sudden interest in what was going on.  I was really pushing it that day.  i started making the wads really small; small enough so that if they hit you in the head you wouldn't feel it.  she had massive hair; i figured one little bump on the head she wasn't gonna feel it.  i threw it, and she didn't feel it.  in fact, it stuck in her hair until she, being a hair brusher and all, pushed her hands through and made it fall out.  Then cole started to take over.  See cos i had tested my theory and guaranteed satisfactory results.  so i gave cole paper, and he started throwing a lot.  he didn't get how to be prudent about it.  finally he hit her in the head with a bit of eraser.  she was livid.  she turned bright red, and looked at the ground and saw that it was littered with trash.  cole had gone out of control though; he was throwing like pencils, and eraser, and pencil sharpeners...it was insane.  Now see, cole liked me but he wasn't the smartest kid and he had left all this incriminating evidence on his desk and so i was like, man, cole's gonna get it.  so he got in trouble, but not too bad.  and he never told on me.  man, that was one of my better days. not for cole.   in fourth grade we had to do this frog project.  this was after i had already had my own frog, and i really hated it.  but we weren't in my teacher's classroom, we were in another classroom, so that really diminished the respect factor for me.  Leila and Kira wanted to be my partner, but i wanted to be partners with kira, so i told leila that i was partners with her last time and so kira and i left.  then this girl, rosie george, the blond girl who i hated, was trying to take care of her frogs.  I told kira i hated her and she didn't want to commiserate with me because she was going through her whole "sainthood phase," so i went ahead on my own.  shoot isn't a swear word anyway, man.  But yeah, so the point was you were supposed to take care of these frogs, and we had to write in our journals about their development.  if you didn't turn in your journal, you didn't pass the project.  one day i was putting all the frog tanks away, and i looked at rosie's tank.  and i got a net.  and i put her tadpole in my tank.  she never found out who did it.  there were lots of leaves and stuff in there, so nobody noticed.  i don't even think kira knew we had two.  the funny thing was, rosie pretended like there was still a tadpole in there.  she would make up descriptions, and i'd be like "where's your tadpole rosie?" and she'd point to something and be like "it's right there."  at the end she got really upset when the teacher said there was nothing in there.  she thought it was okay and that the frog had just died or something, but rosie insisted it was still there.  i was really evil.  my science teacher in fifth grade, mr. wiener (say it.  weener.) was teaching us "astronomy."  He gave us the whole "magic school bus" tour and then got out his mobile with all the planets that were made out of paper maché that probably the poor kinders had to make for us as their labor for that week.  they always had to make stuff for us.  free labor.  Anyway i went up to leila and told her that people lived on venus.  she said "that's not true."  and i said "yeah, haven't you ever heard of the goddess of love?  she lives there, and the people that live there worship her."  then everyone started coming over and asking "does someone really live there?"  this was one of my better attempts at making fools of my classmates.  i almost got in really big trouble for it.  so anyway, i made more and more stories up about "aphrodite" and the venutian society...soon the entire class was talking about the people on venus.  i mean really.  all of them.  there were maybe three or four people who didn't think it was true.  everyone else was like "my parents never told me that!"  then spenser raised his hand, and said "mr. wiener, do you have any photographs of the people from venus?"  and he was like "what are you talking about?" and they all said "but you can't hide it from us, it's true, we know about it."  Leila said "carrie i don't think mr. wiener believes you!" and i was laughing hysterically.  then the whole class got a lecture on how there was no life on other planets, etc...they even had to call in other teachers because it spread to the other classes in my grade...can you imagine how bored i was though?  he knew nothing about it.  and no one ever traced it back to me, cos leila was nice and kept quiet.  Rena, the other teacher tried to blame it on mr. wiener.  he got really flustered.  she was like "fred, you're not supposed to tell them stuff like that, you're just supposed to talk about the planets."  and he said "i didn't tell them that, i don't know who started it."  Ohhh, that was a triumph.  you had to sign up for a buddy in fifth grade to watch the third graders on rainy days, where they had to sit inside their classrooms and play with blocks that they were way too advanced for..."here's a marker, have fun."  i mean c'mon!  so i signed up with tony, because we were a pair, and we would not be separated during rainy day lunch.  so we were sitting there in their little place and they were being the little brats, and tony and i were telling each other about dreams that we had had.  in his a spaceship came down and i was in it, and i offered him a ride in a limo. then these kids started making paper airplanes.  rule one of the rainy day classroom lunch is no paper airplanes.  So we had to get a little nasty.  "stop it.  STOP IT!"  and then we were running after this kid with the airplane, and basically it was a disaster.  So then tony and i threw legos at one another cos we were bored.  then the kids said "we hate you" and we were like "okay, whatever."  then the next day the third grade teacher came into the classroom with a note, and an eager little third-grade twit.  and the twerp was like "you need to read it out loud!"  and my teacher, thinking it was a thank-you note, started to read it.  And it was addressed like a thank-you note, but it wasn't a thank you note.  no it wasn't.  it was hate mail.  it went something like:  dear ms. rosas, fifth grade teacher.  this is the third grade class, just reporting, that we do not want the two students who came in yesterday to ever come back.  we would thoroughly appreciate it if you would punish them for what they did.  they did not take care of us.  here are the bad things that they did: knocked over chairs turned a table upside down and almost hurt somebody threw legos at the kids in the class used the construction paper to make paper airplanes and wouldn't let us use any materials.  they wouldn't put anything away, and we had to clean up everything.  after she had finished the letter, i was in tears and ready to go beat up the little kid that wrote it.  this was horrible.  so i got up and went to the bathroom.  later she apologized and said she was sorry she thought it was a thank you note.  i couldn't stop crying cos i didn't want to lose my lunch.  then my revenge came. my teacher found out who wrote it in the third grade class. and she got benched.   This kid threw a big ball of tape at the trash and missed once, and it almost hit me.  I didn't like him, so i got up and said "YOU DID THAT ON PURPOSE!!!"  and i started pelting him with food.  Poor kid.  i had to clean all the tables after lunch though, so not so poor for him.  Poor me.  I think it's funny that despite all this, i was the one who won the "principal for a day" contest at school.  three years in a row.  i think that's why i didn't listen to anyone.  I gave people autographs when i was principal.  it went to my head.  i forgot it was just for a day.  zach didn't want my autograph though and i said "don't talk to me that way.  i'm the principal of this school."  My teacher tried to get me to come back to class after only half a day.  I sat on a bench.  I should have fired her.  this has been an interview with my kid sister...  lis.

      i am currently redder than a batch of asparagus in hell.  which is what comes of going to the beach and finding out that one's sibling has oublié le crème du soleil, if you will. but oh, how glorious!  The waves were thick today.  So much so that they brought most of the sand offshore rather than sliding back and forth in happy equilibrium.  There was a sharp drop in elevation right at the water's edge; at first it looked like the tide had receded so much we were seeing the slope of the sea's floor, until we stepped into the waves and found it was strong enough to knock us over backwards when it pulled our feet out from beneath us.  i just got out of the shower and there is NOTHING, nothing as exquisite, i tell you, as showering off sand and sweat after a beach day.  unfortunately i also nicked myself while shaving which left a bloody mess of my ankle.  it was really quite bad and stung like heaven.  so now i'm red top and bottom.  but content.  and i smell all peachy.  mmm.  shampoo.  page 220 of keats's bio.  did some reading last night, so i got a good 70 pages in.  i'm taking a little break to catch up on the fiction in my last three new yorkers, and some of the poetry.  my favorite this week was:  epitaph for an explorer  tiger, tiger, my mistake! i thought that you were william blake.   oh my god that's too funny i love it.  keats put in eight hours a day writing and reading.  the third book of endymion was written at oxford fifty lines a day at a time; in three weeks he had written more than half of what he had produced from the previous two books.  it gives me hope.  granted endymion was kind of a flop, but it gives me hope that one can go through a lull and come out of it with a sonnet.  or an ode.  or even an experience of a 4000 line (i think that's right) poem which, albeit somewhat hollow and without an allegorical core, is 4000 lines nonetheless.  Even a shitty 4000 lines is 4000 lines closer to greater things.  no?  i think i prefer the beach in the winter, to be honest.  there aren't evil sand flies that try to eat you.  things:  1.  stop making things with cream sauce if you want that belly to flatten out again. (oh i miss my flat tummy.  poop.  it's a matter of vanity but i allow myself a little once in awhile.) 2.  i told michelle my unfortunate experience and she kind of affirmed my solidity; i felt fine that it was not really my fault and i hadn't done anything particularly wrong but it was nice to hear from a liscensed party.  i have no idea how to spell that word.  hmmm.  anyway.  then we laughed because she said when she got my phone message about it she hung up the phone and then had to listen to the message again, she was so incredulous that something like that would happen to me, of all people.  this sealed the affirmation. 3.  did bush really wave at stevie wonder?  is this true? 4.  where are dees and harry?  i miss them.  ooookay.  back to the new yorker(s).  i'll be there soon. (!)  weeeeird.  gunnysacks and shark attacks, lis.

      in a nook with a book that i took from a bag and a rag with a tag going home with a gnome and his comb   poetry.  life.  poetry.  life.  why do i still subsist on words and not food and flesh and love?  (no title) a type of precision: your eyes through a dark eclipse of dusk approaching communicate the brevity of love in passing thought can't we let our skins alight once more with passion and release? No, the barrier of mud and clay adam made is too thick for that embrace.  (but i will remember it as such: you, laughing, emitting the highest sounds your throat will hold and then, quickly, a pressing of soft breast and nipple against my collar bone the smoothly buffed skin of your feet brushing along the backs of my calves and your heat below warming my belly as we mix the skin of our mouths with the liquid on our tongues and move in one rhyming couplet and a sigh as we fall asleep to the music of patterned breathing)  9.21.02   Because. Because my memory is hazy-- Because your shape has altered (just a little) Because i keep running to look over my shoulder (your walk is the same) Because you write my mind out (without speaking a word of it) Because i see your memory of others, draped in the cover of your face (my absence filled with stronger-etchings of jaws) Because of this--  --Tonight i might sleep but dream only of the love of water--  9.22.02  Pavement Songs  Walking. Pavement molds to my feet. The criss-cross scratches from a broken bottle have chalked the grey and left shards instead of a tumbler full. We hold hands and talk. Somewhere, back at the house is a memory of our hardships, and the future you found in his palm. Now, with just us two bare-footed, I recall the goodness of a kiss. But it passes, and you smile at the right thing of the *overlooked* opportunity.  We choose the *right* path and return to the house. You search for your future and I sit on the curb with a pen, brushing the leaves aside and looking for the sounds of crickets.  9.21.02

      this from last night.  take advantage while you hang me out to dry and i can see you everynight free  i haven’t listened to this cd forever and it was one of my favorites but somehow had to make way for new  why must we always make way for new?  i thought a lot tonight.  home on the train i saw juliette and wanted to say hi and i think she recognized me but neither of us said anything.  i wanted to go up and say hi, i’m in your husband’s class at tc.  i wanted to ask if he read my paper aloud because he liked it or if he thought i had potential and how old was their baby and did she write too and what had eric published and everything.  i wanted to ask how long she had lived in new york, and taken the subway, and what she thought about when there were too many people around to be social, like you do, when you’re in a car, on the train, and it’s all touch and go and start and stop and jolt and greasy metal poles from other people’s skin oils...  i thought about how four faces have come together (dovetails happen to all of us) and they follow me around and whenever i see them as individuals they pull that much more weight behind them.  i thought about wellesley.  i thought about how much i miss the house.  i was in a store with morgan the other day and it smelled the same, and there was the same quiet.  i almost called out “hi jill!”  i miss a ghost.  i miss lots of ghosts.  i remember the day kurt cobain died and what i did that day and i don’t have any idea what i was doing when jeff buckley died or what life was like then but i know i wake up with his face in my mind  i remember the day the lead singer from blind melon died and the stanford band played the song and i was running for practice around the fields for a cool down (we had just done stairs in the stadium and my calves were transposing solid muscle molecules to liquid blood; two limbs filled with sacks of fluid.  patti was still around then.  i remember the day she said she was leaving.  i went to TC today and thought about how i can’t write anymore.  i was going to come home and write a napkin poem in that café on 9th but i didn’t, i was too tired.  i just came in and ate pizza and coke and a chocolate cookie.  and i found an email from al which said “pizza+coke+chocolate = death” and she wasn’t so happy with me then it was right after we had broken up but then i went through other emails, i went through a lot of emails, and i missed.  i missed with my soul and i missed our house, i missed orchard, i missed the charlie’s angels party.  i missed the futon and i missed playing guitar and borrowing her tripod when she wasn’t there and taking silly pictures.  i miss sitting in that curved stairwell.  i miss feeling the place that was ours.  i miss talking about typewriters and puppies and tattoos and photolabs and hangings and mattes.  i miss helen and her bowls of ice cream, i miss building fires with al when we stole ash’s newspapers.  i miss so many things.  and i missed out on so many things.  because of something else.  but then i guess i didn’t miss i just replaced but then, no, i did miss.  because i missed out on me and my senior year and nothing will ever bring that back and sometimes it makes me downright mad.  i had a senior year, i had some amazing wonderful things that year.  in very short periods.  and i hate the cloud that sits over so much of it.  i wish it didn’t.  because i still think about fighting in the snow and traying with burns and walking home at 7 am to stone-d and the last time i saw her when her hair was short and bright blond and we cried cos both of us knew  i think about this  and touchstone and reading aloud harry potter with toots, up until 2 minutes before rehearsal “just one more chapter!” “we haven’t even eaten dinner yet” “oh come on” “you have to go to rehearsal” “i’ll go out the shakes door” “you’ll set off the alarm” “we’ll climb through the window downstairs”  and then it would be wet on top of the green and i’d sprint to the house and jess would give me that look, that irritated look and i’d spew something about sorry i’m late but i’m late for everything always and sometimes they could see that i was having a rough go of it but mostly i just wanted to read harry potter and curl up with toots.  and i remember when she pulled me into the hoop and cried and i remember when later i realized what i had done  this is my later.  it’s like now everything suddenly hit me and i understand but at the same time i don’t because i don’t get how i looked away for a minute and everything left so suddenly.  i remember getting letters oh how i remember getting letters  and i remember her coat.  and standing underneath a streetlamp between founders and clapp and how it was just starting to snow, just barely, but if you looked up and one caught your eye the light would blur for a second, like looking through drops of rain on a windshield.  i remember cutting. yeah, i do.  sometimes i don’t think i will but i remember in orchard and sitting in the corner and her crying and me crying and not knowing what to do and oof maybe this is too much but oh well    there’s so much stuff.  in my head.  about wellesley.  that i want to bring back to life, somehow, in me.  i found myself there and then i lost myself there and it all happened so quickly, in four years  like it was bookended by a beer, maybe two, jack handey, and trying to get some brownies out of a pan.  first and last moments.  of finding myself in a moment, and then realizing how gone i was, when the knife slipped and cut my finger open.  polly wants a cracker  polly says  but it was so much more gradual than all this. and then there are all the memories with her in particular which i try not to think about but i do know she wore that skirt the first day, the first real day and then on the same day when we were standing so far apart in the small little room a year later she was wearing the same skirt  it’s funny that i should think of that but i did.  and i know she didn’t even think of what day it was but i knew, and it just seemed so odd to me, that that should be the same day she met him  like a wash over those memories and i want to kick myself cos sometimes i still wish i counted  i don’t know what to do with all this.  some of it i think might just fade away like most of high school has, i mean i remember so little of high school unless i really sit down and think about it properly.  wellesley i can remember every moment in consecutive order and so many days of the past five years where i just was figuring it all out and now i’m still figuring it all out i’m so tired of fucking figuring it all out.  you know?  i mean sometimes i think college is done yeah that’s so good but oh i miss my friends.  and i miss knowing love and being loved and i miss stuff like that in the stupidest way little things like her knee and the moonlight that came through the panes onto the bed and if you were up early enough, and i always was before i fell back asleep later in the morning how you could smell the air and hear the geese i don’t like all these buildings.  there’s no air.  there’s only little caves to duck in and they’re beautiful hideaways but you can’t ignore the reality of how heavy it is outside  his steps are etched beneath the sidewalk here  she encompasses beauty and she encompasses love and she encompasses wit and laughter and comfort and safety and she encompasses dangerous freedom until i am caged again  and i tried to break out briefly but i think i only took a detour i feel caged again.  i wanted writing to break me out of it but as you can see i can’t for the time being and right now i just feel like crying which is so dumb i don’t know why i do it’s just i want to cry because some of the memories are so beautiful, and so good and that’s what makes them...heavier...like snow on branches... tu me manque, petite.

      ever since they caught me with the sheriff's girl my life's been a terror in the marketplace.   i feel like i've run out of time for things.  i can't find the right niche to write in.  or take pictures in, or play guitar in.  i want my guitar here.  i miss...  oh so many things. her and him and her and that and listening and touch and sound  nothing fits right these days yeah.  i dunno.  it's like it all has to spill out over and over again and this is why people don't make the bed, they just let everything sit because as soon as you get tired it will get messy.  i need to print my paper.  ack.  lis

      it's so very late already i'm in the library i keep thinking back to that i don't know of months and months and months ago and months ago and wondering how i could have turned a screw differently so that this mess in my head was in neater piles. i need to write letters.  i need to write papers.  i need my own room very soon because my space is my space is my space but sometimes i walk by the room and wish it was empty and new and clean for me to make just mine  i've never quite had a space like that not completely.  photography. i keep thinking about the times she would come home with her hands all scarred up from the chemicals and how i wished she would wear gloves so she didn't hurt herself anymore while i sat in the kitchen and tugged at my own skin  i keep thinking that i've been trying to make the past the past and find my own identity but my identity is rooted in the past so how do i reinvent a me that isn't me but the me that i used to be was lost over which is why i'm trying to reinvent me in the first place it's more like trying to get back to me really than reinventing me  if i take photographs  maybe i'll ebb back into being  yesterday i played lizzie's guitar and i wished i had a room and just me so i could play without ears listening.  lis.

      napkin poem #3. the first-- of everything-- a kiss, a movement, the day i hit the soccer ball with the laces of my cleats and i felt the grass --swish-- and then there is that other first, which we roll up like a newspaper to tuck under our arms-- the ink rubs off on our fingers and paints our surfaces-- New York brings me a new place to smudge--  9.15.02 (left in a coffee shop on A and 4th (?))

      a change of title; a change of pace.  I realize i'm keeping like eighty-thousand journals at this point.  but somehow my livejournal posting just didn't cut it for me.  i'm still updating that one, but i think i missed a space without the little faces and without the ability for others to post comments but one that was still public enough for, oh, i don't know.  ramblings.  I have to write on why teach writing. why? i know why i write.  do i know why i write?  it's such an abstract thought.  i mean, why take photographs?  why create art?  i suppose i could hit the journalist documenter's level of thought, the historian's pitch, the importance of culture in a certain era.  but that's not why i write.  and lately things have been strange.  lately i've had the feeling that all my thoughts, all my poems are being slowed up in a heavy layer of cotton and fatigue and the thickness of memory.  i miss my little bits of afternoon discovery; i miss knowing what it was that mattered to me right then.  knowing that that little slip of paper with words in a seemingly jumbled order to me, was important. but why?  i can't have any explanation for it.  it's just the way i breathe life.  art is why i get up in the morning but my reason ends there you know it doesn't seem fair...  old space for new words.  I've been thinking a lot about particular beauties lately.  the sound of jeff buckley's voice.  i walk by that place that lauren showed me everyday on my way to and from work; sometimes i pause and try to see beneath the neon paint and behind the speedy techno chaotic rumbling, just to catch a glimpse of the old walls, and maybe feel the reverberations of his voice still caught in the woodwork.  it doesn't happen.  only in my mind after i leave and turn away from the space can there exist change.  tonight i go with lizzie to see her friend play a set at a café.  I'm excited for it.  Barbara and i were at the living room last night, which i think actually is owned by the same people that owned sin-é.  but it's now, not then.  this is all now.  i wake up and think how the past reasserts itself in my head each day.  sometimes it pushes on my heart so heavily i don't know how i lift my own weight.  when beauty disappears it leaves me with a hole.  when people disappear and take their beauty with them the whole is ragged, and bleeding, and while i think i've sopped up most of the pool the scar tissue itself still throbs.  like this cut in my finger.  on cold days it aches.  I don't know why i look to the past and not the future.  maybe it's where my writing stems from.  maybe it's because the future is so big and heavy.  it's like that email i wrote to niall, about his ocean and my island.  i need to see the edges before i can push at them.  sigh.  i miss him.  i really missed him last night when we watched the set, because he was so much better than the first guy and i thought "niall should be here he could kick this guy's ass."  and then i missed my own guitar.  i think that's just the thing.  i've been writing so much lately that my creative though has fled to other corners of my brain; it's tired of the same words pulling at its thread.  i need to unravel it in a different medium.  photography may help.  my guitar would help a lot more.  the repetition of the chords; just the practice sort of lets things build for awhile until the good stuff can really spin out well.  occupational release.  i bide my time and tomorrow i'll write a napkin poem or maybe tonight, if i'm in the mood  and i miss her, i miss her sometimes i see her in the marketplace and i cry out, and they hold me down they think i've seen the saviour's face but it's only that i'm lonely and when the preacher comes oh that's the worst part   lis.

      more wellesley writings.  and i was curled up on the top bunk wondering whether they'd ever come back and i thought i heard tempe sneak in.  i wanted to stay asleep though so i didn't move, didn't even creak.  she came and checked and then left again.  when i awoke i wasn't sure it had happened.  and alison and i sat and talked about it, and ate multigrain cheerios.  but it was just a passing brevity; nothing to stick in the mind of later years.  one morning she came out (the bells were playing the simpsons again, and i wondered if bethers could hear) and said "wheeeeee!  i've had 3 hours of sleep, lis!  it's like being drunk!" standing on the steps of founders with her scarf hanging on the left and her peacoat open.  it was not winter, not just.  the first time we went to the house we were on the wrong day.  the matinee had been on saturday and it was a sunday.  alison knocked and tried the door but julius was closed to our ears and eyes.  the house at that time looked whiter and the door like something into alice's world.  i remember it distinctly though my memory is not at all accurate.  we walked back to stone-d and i felt tall, silly, wondering why so many doors seemed closed.  the next time was for twelfth night and the stairway twisted and gave off the scent the house gives to people who don't know it, who haven't spent time with its creaky floorboards and dusty basement floors which have seen much more than the eroticism they're named for.  A sorry stigma and i spent enough time there my junior year to know what's beneath the outside reputation, which i myself perpetuated.  it's like housing a secret that you're not even sure everyone in the society knows about.  you get it if you direct and you get it if you love the house as you would a person, and not just a relic, a dusty museum full of newer fads and fantasies.  we sat and i watched marta up on the stage.  i watched them dance and laugh and knew that was where i wanted to be, where i belonged, where everything was meant to sit.  the board that time was leaning up against the wall and not on the rolling legs it inhabited later.  it was earlier then.  i don't know how the house will smell for lear.  much the same, but retrospectively, maybe, with little holes in the spaces between people.  like photographs tucked away in the walls.  lis.

      mmmm.  jeanette winterson.  all my books are in a bag in my other apt.  not mine properly, but the place i have inhabited for the past month.  and my computer and other things are there as well.  and thus i write here, instead of in a file to be tucked away and reviewed once in awhile when i want to monitor myself.  i think it's time to start wellesley writings. there is so much reflection in there that i should tap into.  i keep running over the grooves of my memory and sticking myself on a pinprick of senior year.  but this morning i sat and i read my piece aloud and decided it was worth it.  so i'm delving into a split journal here.  memory and new.  the first thing i remember is the same as the last.  i remember driving with my mother into the town.  it was the day after her birthday and the trees were still all green from summer.  i didn't know any of the people then that i know now.  we hadn't met and left handprints or smiles with each other.  i can't remember if route 16 was as bumpy then as it is now.  everything looked foreign and wooden and there were white slats in fences everywhere; so different from the overgrowth of twisted vine and clay curved roof tiles atop white cool walls that i still associate with california.  my house looks nothing like that style but there's one every block; at least one recalling our spanish influence, when the missionaries came and built their churches and converted and killed off the indigenous populations. this was different.  this was eastern and oak leaves and neatly trimmed lawns and visible cemetaries not for war.  this place hearkened back to puritan ancestry and not a western wildness that somehow imbedded itself in my mind.  this morning, i woke up looking out on a lake in new york and thought of tootsie.  it's so early. lis i always get up this early.  let's go take pictures. it's so early.  it's not even breakfast time yet. i've still got triscuits and cheese.  tootsie taught me that if you fold a kraft single into quarters it fits perfectly on a triscuit.  she also taught me about sunrise.  it's so odd that it comes up over the water instead of setting. i know.  stand still.  it's different here.  it's colder. toots is wearing her jacket which poofs up around her and seems to swallow her freckles beneath its down.  i'm wearing a tattered sweatshirt wearing thin from too many plane trips and too tired to enjoy the beauty this woman is sharing with me, at 5 am on a friday morning.  we have apples with us in a paper bag and honey sticks from the farm.  i've been trying to chew the top off of mine for a good twenty minutes but pretending i've actually bitten through; she managed hers in thirty seconds or so and i don't want to look stupid for not having done it yet.  and then there are other times.  waking up naked in a fetal position in the corner.  Afraid of sex (still), but wanting to meld in with her and run my hands along the edges of her tattoos.  some days they were raised a little and some they smoothed out again into polished color.  we always woke early and my side was just above the heater with the thin blue curtains, which would bang every morning about six.  some days we played raquetball and some days we took the car out and braved the snow and tried to find decent coffee.  most days we laid in bed and read harry potter.  i was always conscious of how my voice sounded.  i could have sunk into her story voice easily but for our disagreement on the pronunciation of hermione.  it's her-my-o-nee.  her-mee-one.  nuh uh.  it's like in shakespeare. i don't see that. well i'll say it my way and you say it yours.  when we got to the fourth book and the line described her name phonetically i felt a little guilty for being right.  i kind of liked our ongoing fight.  but we weren't together anymore so it didn't matter so much.  ***

      it was spring, and warm.  meg was in overalls and i was in blue pants that buttoned on the sides, like sailor trousers, with flares at the bottom.  she always made me think of tie-dye and cloves.  It was nice to be old enough to be young.  Her hair was blond and mine was lightening every day.  Tall and short.  An even pair.  We sang barenaked ladies songs all the way to rehearsal.  Sang them on the way into the vil to get our hair cut (she short and i stayed longish), and then on the way back, though she kept stopping to play with the air where she had once taken up space.  It's all gone! Meggers, it's great!  let's sing.  and then we went to rehearsal and had segued a line in so that we could turn around and the posted signs on our backsides made our director fall out of her chair with laughter.  Things were separate then, and less difficult.  I felt easy in my skin.  Love was tangible, but I ignored it because I was still afraid.  It came about later and perhaps confirmed my fears, perhaps made me rethink my ideals.  Mostly it just ached and throbbed its way through my capillaries until i sent it shooting out into the mirror and found cold eyes staring back at me.  Those nights were warm.  Burns's room smelled like dirty socks and empty soda cans, but in a good way.  And the haus was only mine, just mine and not a smidgen of insight could break our secret.

      i was without napkins.  these were on a train ride.  (thank you mom, for letting me take the express).   paper cuts.   the clean, unbroken page.  Marred with inkstaining that to future generations will be ashes; black scratches on acid-eaten parchment with no stone to translate nor etch out any metaphor of remembrance.  therefore, let me spill out meaning here, love, and name my hidden secrets: in years, an age from now, they will pore over this manuscript's code, shrug and pass it into the fire. thousands of preserved, translated texts will grace a new millenium stage to bring words of ancients wise alive for eager, open-mouthed faces, but not mine, nor this page, my love.  Clasp it in your hand and finger the momentary-worded flesh of my paper love.  this is all we have of documented memory; you and i know of moments passing in the dim, but even if we should cry out to cities and worlds above, the air would forget our heaved passion, and the ocean wash away our skin printings. Our eden is transitory.  therefore, love, take your time to read, lest my face disappear before shutting your eyes.     a king lear story.   The fool toes a wall. N'uncle, do you know how an egg makes two crowns? The  actor  shakes his head. She tiptoes along the ledge of painted rock wood and cracks an imaginary egg, letting the yoke slide down the old man's face. My hands are sticky. These are lights I have set and walls I painted for the forest of Arden. Now it is bare as the heath.  The fool flips to the left side and twists N'uncle's beard. I know the warp in the floorboards she now fondles with the arches of her feet. The lights bear reflection on her hands, casting a blue wash of the upcoming storm. I sit in the shadows. Quiet Puck, watching.

      quick observation: i swear a lot when entering any extreme form of emotion.  whether positive or negative.  touchstone moment:  dani and i made our exit, looked at each other, and grinned.  then we jumped.  then we laughed hysterically.  we nailed that scene in the balls and we knew it.  that was when i knew i could act.

      winter day, february 1999  there was this one time that burns got stuck in her jacket. it was the big poofy black one.  the zipper was all the way at the tiptop right where her neck was.  it was snowing so as long as we stood outside she was okay; if we went into the haus though, she squirmed from her body heat. "get me out, lisard, get me out!" I was afraid of catching the skin at her throat in the zipper.  we pulled, each of us, her at the top collar and me at the zipper, pulling, squirming, but nothing came loose.  i wondered if she could wiggle out of it, pulling it over her head and her arms out of the sleeves, like taking off your bra under your shirt. but the bottom was too small to fit her shoulders. eventually we walked into the ville through the snow; it was snowing big, thick flakes down on our eyelashes so her lack of peripheral vision from the jacket hood didn't matter so much.  once we fell, slipping on some ice; her shoes were not made for winter. she caught me on her way down but the jacket broke our fall. we laughed, brushing the clusters of white from our eyes. it was the best day i ever had there. but i never found out how she did get out of that jacket.

      a six stringed guitar.  the callouses are slowly developing on my fingertips.  steel-string imprints on my ring finger; dulling the feeling, the nerve endings losing their breath.  the skin grows thick and hard, meshing with the wood.  soon i will be able to press down hard enough to play out the rest of this.  i've grown tired of memory.  the ones i have of you are slowly being calloused over, as well; the more sound a g-chord i can play the better i recall the worst of it.  you are no longer a glassy-eyed dream i had at 19.  It is difficult, grappling with this.  i had the ideal of you in my head, in a little picture i had not framed but kept in a drawer until i couldn't bear to keep it hidden.  and then you, a muse of mine, grew bones, ankle and foot bones, all the little brittle bits knitted together to form a standing figure.  the collar and ribs fell a bit crookedly, where the meter ran thin, but this was barely discernible.  On top of this I laid flesh, freckled in parts, mostly smooth and brown from the summer.  i gave you a face but never saw it all at once.  I was like a person losing their ability for composition; i only saw the smallness of your nose, or the lower lip bitten by crooked teeth, but never the face that held it.  if i stumbled across your eyes my vision was lost for days in their color and ignored their level of understanding.  you were artifice.  years later, you are still artifice, though your eyes have passed long out of my vision.  this is why.  i am saddened that a notion of love had so little to do with you and so much to do with an idea.  an impossibility realized briefly and once it has been realized, how can it be temporary?  to accomplish this is to triumph over fate, over parameter, over convention and reality.  and we lived in dream instead of the last, because i was happy in either place, and you frequently substitute one for the other.  we mixed the two but they separated.  greek coffee.  the thickness and syrup at the bottom inevitably will be uncovered.  i muck around in the grit and you stand at the edge of the porcelain lip and wave down.  my hands are covered in grease.  it is cruel to stand down here and know this weight never touched you.  i cannot explain it properly because you cannot explain blindness to a person gifted with sight.  they close their eyes and see the shadows of the light they just left, instead of the invisible creation coming from within.  They do not understand the keeness of smell, or touch.  To attempt to explain to you why this still affects me promises tears, and a feeling of lowliness.  you would not let it touch you.  you ignored it and pushed it down and so of course, with all your new, more recent heaviness to consider, you find my plight strange.  but i am backward, and old-fashioned, and full of ancient thought.  when a person becomes art they may haunt the same way a painting, or a word, can drive you mad.  i stay awake and think up alternate endings for Pyramus and Thisby.  even the dumb show has its tragedies.  but soon, it will all be dulled over.  dead hardened skin across the thickness of memory.  soon i will play it out and let adolescents scrawl my isolation across their journal pages in fitful anger.  again, this is not you.  it is my own painting.  i lost more blood over it than you might remember, or know.  eventually, it will change.  i won't think of it (it has waned in the course of these months, despite my resurgence of thought) nearly ever.  it will become fiction.  only you have held onto the bones that materialized when i dreamed you up out of a photograph, while you were far away.  your flesh stretched thin over them, and your eyes lost a light (perhaps pain, perhaps honesty, perhaps relief) i knew.  you are not you because you were only the dream in sketches, in the in-betweens.  when there was silence, and snow.  without interruption.  i am beginning to recall the gaps and hate them again.  with time things become favorable, until reminders of the dark bits surface.  what i closed my eyes to then hits me now deep in the stomach and makes me rage with grief, with instability, with belittlement.  all of this you do not know because you never really knew what you did.  you never really looked me in the face and saw your golden etching lining my mouth, my eyes.  I was gagged by your beauty, and blinded with your good intentions.  there is a crack in this cup.  the syrup pours out of it thickly, and runs down the sides of the table, muddying the white linen.  if i can escape and follow my path out i will hold onto the past without remaining trapped by it.  you are trapped in a different past and remain in the fishbowl from your early days, though i think it grows bigger now, while you examine the carnage left behind you.  perhaps soon the glass will expand far enough that we might touch across a pane.  perhaps when it reaches me i will keep my back turned, like a sensible girl, and let you drown in your own idealism.  we each have our own.  mine is thicker than the accent of the deep south.  until i know how to make my own decisions again, without the looming eye of approval which i painted (in your image) in the sky, i cannot watch.  bury me, and bury me deep.

      back from the pear.  here in the ...what do they call san francisco?  it all appears in technicolor upon my return.  the fog is foggier, the hills hillier, the dampness thicker in my future arthritic bones.  Monterey cypress lining the little finger of the peninsula.  home tastes sweeter somehow, this time.  I can't decide why.  there was loneliness that came up.  and i thought, who are you to speak to me of loneliness?  she speaks to me of a new possibility.  and then asks.  and who are you to ask, i think, who are you to ask?  not weird, no it's not weird.  there is no word that describes it.  it's like looking through a window of i life i used to covet, and now can't shake off my back.  An itch i can never reach to gnaw away at with my fingertips.  and so it burns and burns and i cover it up with bedcloth and underwear but it still burns a little.  and you ask if it's "weird, still?"  No, no, not weird.  not still.  simply always, as she described it, "the old wound."  in latin, mind you.  in latin it was much more romantic and contemplative, as though i had suffered something stoic, fought in a battle and trumped my enemy with splinters in his feet, unbraided his curses into my own poetry, and fed on his sweat and saliva.  She was my siren.  When i awoke she disappeared and the reality of it was i had a splinter lodged in the forefinger of my left hand, in the shape of a scythe.  which was, is my constant reminder.  it's not weird.  it's simply dull, like the mention of a friend long dead, but still breathing, bright and beyond all artifice in memory.  The old wound sits in my grave with me and we play tic-tac-toe and word games until the late hours of the morning and i remember what it was like to covet this one's confidence instead of despise it, instead of wish it away from me though i find my love will still seek it out.  But the truth of the matter is she is alive and well in the world; this grave i have dug for myself.  I curl up in its shallow bed and paste strings of the native tongue of confessionalism along the treeroots.  at the end there is a running camera of images which become thinner each time i revisit them, like a blue wash steadily running over a face.  all this if i stop to think.  most of the time i don't bother with it, i laugh it away or pretend it was someone else.  perhaps it was.  it does not matter.  i am not fickle.  i chose my path and it ended.  and now that route is dead, and i consider it so. to ask pulls a cord tighter around my throat and i will not open up, not knowingly.  now does not matter to me in that way.  years will pass and i promise it will be the same as now, as it was then beside unshaded lightbulbs and the draft from a basement window.  i meant what i said when i said it.  i am not fickle.  i choose firmly.  it is my own undoing for choosing as i did.   you left some stars in my belly.

      the reminder was that when she turned over a little moan fluttered out.  i was sadder than i had ever been in my life, and turned and saw her there, confused but still unconscious.  it was all a mountain of nothing, the coolness of the sheets and the pale light from the windows adding up, burying the nothing under muffled layers, until it cried to get out.  and i cried, and could not sleep, and she could not sleep, but pretended.

       author of a letter gone missing   Her closet must look a mess. And of course this is based On Conjecture.  I would guess She might cringe when faced With its contents.  Beneath The shoes, the string, a broken knife without a sheath, Grey socks and volley balls, a Wedding Ring Which her grandmother let her to play Dress-up with—not a real one, only a plaything, But she didn't know, and the grandmother would not say— Beneath all this, there lies A little trapdoor.  Pull it up, if you want. It isn't very heavy, given the size And thickness of the boards.  Nothing haunts Its crevice.  It's only a little hollow Which holds a box of letters.  I'm surprised She kept them.  The parchment's gone sallow, Paled, untouched by man or insect.  The meaning comprised Within's discernable, though, to brush off a crumb of dust or two. Each one ends: "I love you."  1.27.03

       Poet Song   There are pieces.  Crystalized luminescence against a window. If I look through it, I see a tree, scratching at its forearm, The blue-white glow of nighttime box channels, And my own thin shape in the glass, double-etched (in two panes).  They, the ones who mattered, went out like a small cough. A minute expiration; One exhalation of breath, and then The singing stopped.  The cruelty Rests in knowing How Quietly they must have gone, Once they were gone. And then, in Death— A poet screams out my ears. I can only think of death.  Words fill up (in place of Beauty) My lungs with water, or gas, or blood.  Images, different noses aligned In my window Against my profile That say, you, too, will come away with this. No— My death will be quiet. No one will hear my angel screaming.  In heaven, i will sit on my own little patch of air And see them clawing back towards the world With blue-stained and blistered fingers, Shrieking out the pain of beauty To those who want it to matter. The Din Will reverberate around the place, and the Gods Will kick their poet children out again Until they learn To make thier peace and be grateful, Letting the old men sleep.

       Accidental Forms   Sometime after, she talked of love. "He asked me how I, a woman, Could know about that.  What reason I had, when lucidness takes flight And leaves bodies to lustful nature. One falls with abandonment, madly, Not with sense."  Her hands fold in the quiet.  Alone, the house stays quiet. The mirror on her dresser says LOVE In bright red letters; reflects a woman. As a child she painted, before reason Took hold, and she knew for flight You must have wings, which nature Had not given her.  To paint madly  One  must  have wings.  Madly, Like the artist breathing in the quiet; Color, not words, speaking love. Red is the shade assigned for woman. She remembers this for a reason; As when his passion took flight And showed her the blueprints of nature.  Her mother told her Mother Nature Brought the thickness on, that madly Men spilt blood, while she, in quiet Repose, released her own from love. But she feels the heaviness of woman, And her mother's soft spoken reason Cannot relieve the hollow left from flight.  Outside, a moth hovers in flight Near the lampost.  In its nature. It nears the burning bulb, madly, Touches and falls dead, quiet. In the kitchen she signs a letter with love, Adds the postage, addresses it.  The woman Puts it in the fire.  No reason.  She does not need, or want, a reason. She watches the momentary flight Of the letter, before nature Eats the paper greedily, madly Spitting smoke.  It thins back to quiet. She sits and thinks about love. About shapes; the shape of a woman.  She sketches the silhouette of a woman And searches it for reason. Outside, a bird halts its flight And asks to be let in from nature. It tap tap taps on the window, madly, Then flies away.  She relishes quiet. It reminds her of the stillness of love.  The inside of the house remains quiet, Though nature blows away madly Outside.  The woman gives memory flight To replace reason, discover love.

        Write your Morning.    jumpstart.  or at least it felt like a good time for such a thing but when you live uptown on the west side you don't stumble into coffee shops like you might trip over pennies.  I can only smack my head into ten blocks of cold, and then a starbucks.  i don't need coffee.  what i need are kisses.  and i'm lolling about and the morning is only gray this way.  my tongue is sour from coconut curry of the night before and the laziness of my toothbrush and everything meshes together in front of me.  an unlikely subject for a portrait.  they never make portraits of people when they're half-asleep.  not even photographs.  i liked waking up to you.  and the second morning i peered in and saw you asleep in your brother's bed and wished for closeness.  i felt lousy, that was all.  and my nerve endings had missed the agenda of holding your frame.  your upper arms and the softness they carry.  my thought tends towards a tightness, an ecstacy of curve and form (though next to you i feel sluggish and unrefined.  my stomach won't pack in, my butt and thighs stretch their casings and roll about my knees.  I am lousy, awkward, undesirable).  to become enveloped in your feeling would excel my dreams.  to dream with you would simply excel.  and so i sit and stare idly at the shades hiding a february sun.  the morning sneaks its way through buildings and into the classroom, illuminating the pates of my students.  i should be thinking about my current task, or perhaps the war.  the feel of your eyelashes, instead, roots its way into occupation.  and then i wonder about distance.  you are far, just now.  in spirit and in ground.  i placed a wall down with the expression of sincerity and now you lean on the other side and whistle as the boys pass.  if i peer through the cracks i see your blond hair throw winks at me from the afternoon light, like an inconstant thisby, flirting with her lion.  my fingers ache from prying rock.

       no title   The farther away from memory, the less the detail. Everything seen in snatched reels, commercial-long. But this is only yesterday, And I cannot write, for the ink dries upon point; Your thighs still cut the stale air in this room From gossip.  It will be years before anyone writes about it. Opening a door and knocking loose the preserved Air, a man Will breathe in evening.  In it, He will taste the quality of your skin, and mine, The hint of chlorine I detected on your forearm, Salt, and Blood.  He will not know about How your face pulls back like a cat's ears when you laugh, Changing it completely, nor feel the pressure Of your hip sinking into the hollow of mine. Instead, he will open a window, letting this out, Giving it to the wind of a painted city, and make His own imaginary bed, his own imaginary love, And in the morning wonder how good his memory is.  He will not see what I see now: a sock you left on the floorboards. I pick it up and rub it a little, trying to feel your foot, then put it down again. It will do best where it is for now, until I sleep another night In new sheets.  Until water drains, and I can finish bleeding Without thinking of how you jolted awake, startling my hold, Laughed, and stopped inquiries with your tongue.  I keep its taste inside my lower lip. It repels the stain of ink, as i put pen to mouth, Wetting the tip.

        Absence.    A germ of beauty.  Strangers, holding hands.  I pass them and let the smoke from the subway grate funnel up my shirt cuffs.  Caught. The man on the corner sells tea, bagels.  He was once a jet pilot.  The sidewalks blend in with the street, camoflauging their squares.  I can't tell us apart either, looking down; your skin covers kneecaps while my hands cover skin.  The light is pale, but warm for dawn.  It fingers folded linen, tangled sheets, the hair brushing the corner of your mouth.  It is morning.  I turn to find you are not you, but a pillow—the stuffed imposter of an absent form. I thumb an eyelash from my cheek spied through half raised lids.  You remain a dream, or memory (both occupying one space) for me to finger as i tie back hair, pull on shoes for coffee.  Now, walking through these collected polaroids, the rain strengthens color and i trace the print on a pant leg, so as not to forget your face, its angles, its turns, lifted from netted dreams.

      and meanwhile through all of it you have forgotten music.  Where a wrongly placed sentence paces you too slowly—your shoes step in footprints you thought you made just a minute ago—and suddenly everything is loose.  The small binding metals which hold together all that documentation (of which there isn't really any, though you covet the mountain of unevenly stacked handouts atop the desk, their outlines perforated and clamped together with the iron security of office supplies) break their fast and hold onto open air instead.  The structure of days blows over neatly tiled floor and you trip on edges.  In the middle of it, you remember you are in love.  Or at least you think you might be, this moment, with this music.  With life, your job.  Failure smarts extra because the aim lies beyond pleasing your occupants.  You want to do it right.  Anticipate every move, with surprises wrapped and labeled ahead of time.  To stay ahead of footsteps.  In all this, there is a girl.  She is pressed into a harbour city your fingertips have covered—the greasy metal of subway poles, the coallated corners of bricks.  It was buried in snow last time you saw the place.  Now you only get a voice.  Mmmms and huhs and you are afraid of running out of sounds too quickly.  5 years and then stumbled, found yourselves stripped of reservation, thrust into each other impatient and eager.  Your tongue hovers at the back of your teeth for a hard syllable at the end of every conversation but you leave it poised, and close your mouth on it before it materializes.  The fear of sounding too genuine, and stretching the continent.  Somewhere, your nation breaks its protocol.  This is bigger, too big to understand.  Another friend lies in bed, grappling with the desire for scars.  It is harder to heal imagined hurts, and you wonder if she did not see her own brightness and love reflected in your eyes when you looked at her during evenings.  Did you not show it?  The idea of love, too rough and swollen to get past the throat.  It sticks, and you suck plastic words out of an inhaler to keep it down.  Smile, and walk under red and yellow clouds, which rise up from the sea.

      The air chills expired breath. Her eyes glitter with the cold, Bright, piercing in their blue. This morning, the lake is softly blue, Softer than her eyes, her quiet breath. She hugs herself away from cold (Though it is only an early cold, a morning frost, revealing the breath of my companion, sighing liquid blue). Holding my breath, I kiss her cold tears, tasting blue.

      The morning goes in stages.  Like this:  Get up.  This is the most difficult. My feet curl and rub together, petting themselves to sleep again, while the rest of me twists towards the vertical.  I blindly swat away light, grasp for a pillow.  Having been overwhelmed by responsibility, I scrub my ears and teeth stumble into pants and find my subway card, in yesterday’s back pocket, then climb the escalator to my elevated platform and hang out over Broadway.  Harlem is just north.  I have never been there.  On the train, a man and I both aim for the same seat.  I get there first and he slides into me, big pants, puffy jacket. It is spring. I press myself up against the pole, thinly; he spreads his knees and lounges across three of the orange plastic curves lined up like little eggcups to hold pre-positioned people. Breaks form.  He chews on a fountain of spit and taffy fluffing the gum up like a pillow and then squishing it between his teeth, saliva squirting out and running back for a second round between his cheeks. This is my punishment for taking the fourth seat. He leans in close and plays it in my ear with altering rhythms: quick quick quick blow, smack, blow, smack quick quick quick slurp quick. We are 15 stops away, on a local, and I think there is no God.  At 42nd, the poles are freshly painted an omniscient green. I think the paint must be thicker than the iron beneath; they seem to refresh them every week and there is no weather down here to wear it down, only finger oils, shoulders, backs, piss, vomit, and lazy forearms. I suspect they paint it all in, the dust and debris of people. The smacking man gets up, leaving me to my row, disappearing to a stationary platform. I pull out your letter,  the one I am writing to you, which has yet to cover a clean flat page in which I tell you all about new york. I’m not sure I want to and anyway what I really want to tell you about is you and how the way your knees fold and lose me in their creases.  I want to explain the impressions they left on my hands.  You would be more interested in new york stories the vivid flash of rain on taxicabs and the boys who ask me for my phone number in dim bars filled with cluttered sound where we drown out whispers.  I think of watching the light change throughout the afternoon and how the shadows glided over your hips until sunset. I get off the train and Swim  with the morning rush hour up the stairs to the flat, hard pavement above my head.

       oranges   My thumb cuts into the skin. I slit the shell, its bumpy surface Spraying bitterness back under my nail. Its outside is angry and hard, Shouting color.  Beneath These outer defenses I find A new layer of white.  It is thicker Than the skin, murky.  But soft. I want to linger here, and breathe this in.  I paint Along the uncovered grooves With my index finger, relishing the anticipation of sweetness Below the film of surface.  It pushes back Against my touch; taut.  I slide a thumb in, underneath the white, careful Not to break the flesh.  It unravels, inviting me Towards the core.  Brushing back the last strings of white I separate the wedges, cleaning each one Completely Until they are free of their cover And reveal the threaded veins Which spill together Until I bite in And they release. The juice is thick, filling my mouth With sweet acidity. I finish, wiping clean with the back of a wrist, Loosening the stickiness.  I look down, eyeing the ridges of remaining shell. They unfold their clutter to hollowed air. Brushing the table clean I notice: -This- Had no heart.

      i wonder how this happened: an afternoon colored by water and the gray silking off of buildings; bannered purple and green to catch the paint of park benches. your eyes are brown today, though yesterday they were lighter, hazel, maybe, like the sun.

      I like talking in British accents.  In fact I often do it.  When there are British people around, I refrain, because usually two things can result.  One, you are looked at as irritating and a poor imitation, a sad little american who knows nothing of the refined version of English they speak over there.  Or, two, you are actually mistaken for someone from Britain, and when asked where you grew up, you run the risk of falling into this trap:  "um, Breddock..shire.  Yeah.  It's really small." "No joke!  I've got an uncle from there!  You probably know all my family!  You have a strange accent for that part of the world." "Oh...I don't know..." "Well but surely you went to the primary school with some of my cousins.  Oh, what's that street it's on?  It has such a funny little name.  Come on, you must know this..."  Thereby getting yourself into very, very hot water.  And, of course, perpetuating the disparaging ideas about Americans and their attitude towards europe, etc.  Of course I attempt frequently to embarass myself about being American, but doing it while  in  America is much better than overseas, where it's a given.  Here you have to work a little harder to make your blunders look quite so spectacular as you can with great ease in say, Dublin, or Oxford.  All this to say stick to your syllables, and avoid looking like an idiot.  As obviously avoiding looking like an idiot (see "Paisley" below) is what this little editorial is all about.  Because if you don't, you end up drunk on the sidewalk with no one taking you home.  Yesterday I attended the memorial day weekend extravaganza at Jess's house, a regular ritual over in the slope since she has inhabited her apartment.  It was a nice little friends and family gathering as we set up the vegetarian and non vegetarian grills, lit the match-flame coals, and reveled in the sight of pre-douced lighter fluid happy burning charcoal.  in fact had to move the plants back a bit, as the flames were taking a liking to them.  And there were a lot of plants.  Woah!  Flirtation time later, ladies and gents!  Right now you gotta cook us some meat!  As we basked in the glow of our "i make fire without sticks, i have the power" glory, a slow but steady infiltration of Brit-sounding lads began to spill over onto the deck.  Let it be said that these fellows (and a few lasses with them) were over-laden with meat.  I mean, I've never seen that much meat.  So much meat that I began to reel from visions of the toppling steaks that were piling their way towards me.  We did not know these people; they were friends of (or possibly friends of friends of) jess's roommate, but they made themselves right at home.  Everywhere.  And frequently popped into conversations where meat was concerned.  "Dude.  Alison. there's a lot of meat here.  I think if I eat anymore sausage I might fall over." (here enters rather large british man wearing much in the way of black and donning piercing gear about his face) "Oh, yes, um, sorry to bother you, but speaking of meat, would you mind passing me those steaks over there?" "Oh, uh, yeah, here you go." "Cheers, thanks."  As the night went on, I started feeling a bit more claustrophobic, what with tongs and steaks whizzing by my head at breakneck speed.  I had the misfortune of placing myself directly between the meat and the barbeque; so all transactions were carried out over my head, including the manuevering of a frightening amount of raw marinated chicken, which finally wound up next to the salsa.  I decided not to see what happened to it after that.  We went inside only to commence discussion of Kill Bill 1.  Appropriate as it was, given the evening, the graphic sound effects provided by alison were enough to make me regret my dinner.  After all this hoolahlah with the meat and the movie and a couple of games in which we tried to write down all 50 states in 5 minutes and discussed the drying effects of 4 saltines in one's mouth, some folks came back in from the deck to guide a very drunk, very stumbling woman down the stairwell and out the door.  She was distinctly british in her "oops oh sorry whoa" narration of walking across the floor, which took a few detours until the menfolk were able to guide her down the steps.  At which point Tempe turned to me, and said:  "Was she british when she came in?"  The same thought had been in my head, and I said as much.  There was some debate, and we settled on the fact that she waffled between the two, sounding british when she spoke with the brits and distinctly american at other points.  Her origin unknown, we could only assume she came in with the british folk as one of their own, and perhaps our ears had not fully translated the subtlety of her accent.  Moments later, the menfolk returned, brushing their hands as if having finished the last of their grueling tasks of the evening, and went back out to the porch.  My thoughts, before returning to the saltine argument, went after the sad drunken lady.  Was she out there, lying out on the sidewalk?  In a cab somewhere trying wildly to narrate her address in broken english?  I could only conclude that having shuffled off their burden, the boys were outside visciously attacking her pronunciation and mixture of slang as they inhaled more burning meat, and the poor girl fell victim to yet another "take care of your own" partiality in the ways of the world.  Well.  It's possible.  It is not possible, however, to eat 4 saltines in one minute.  So be forewarned next time you make a claim like that.

      Dear God, Blame the Paisley on Something.  Also: Nerve Damage is like an Icy-Hot!  So for the past three days I have noticed that a burning cold sensation has been arising in my elbow.  It hasn’t so much traveled down my arm or into my fingers yet, which I suspect is a Good thing.  It has gotten more frequent, which I suspect is a Bad thing.  However, the potential degenerative qualities of this assumed injury (how does one get nerve damage in one’s elbow?  I don’t play the tennis) have made me go into something of a hypochondriac last gasp-type sporadic existence.  It propels me to do things.  Unsightly things.  Where is your mother and I hope she doesn’t know what you’ve become type things.  Such as wearing this shirt.  The purchasing was an impulse, oh wouldn’t that be fun if we ever threw a seventies party type buy, so I can blame that on shopper’s fatigue/delirium.  You know, actual, diagnosable, stuff, where you’re in a store and all the pretty things seem to meld together until you’re willing to fork over your life for an ugly scrap of linen which will do you no good now that it’s September (but it’s so much cheaper than it  used  to be!  Look, look when it was $120 and now it’s only $76!  That’s not even $80!  That’s like they’re just giving it away!  It needs a home.  What if no one buys it?  It needs a home in MY closet, look at those cute puppy-dog buttons!  Quick, before someone buys it, take it off the shelf!  I neeeed it!).  This is a documented phenomenon, witnessed over and over again in shopping malls across America, and beyond.  Well, probably beyond.  Otherwise Gucci never would have made it.  I’m not sure the actual wearing of the purchase can be justified in this way.  My only explanation for my stubbornness, even after looking in the mirror and seeing the thing on me, is that my impending icy-hot death has made me realize I must live life to the fullest.  If all of the nerves in my body are soon going to be turned into tingling ripping sensors of pain, I might as well have fun in the meantime.  Actually this occurred to me while in the shower.  The thought process went something like this:   Ow.  Hey, that pain is on the same side of my body as the nerve problems in my foot.  That can’t be good.  Wait.  I’m getting old.  I’m almost a quarter of a decade, in fact.  Oh my god, I’m almost dead.  My body is just a decaying shell.  I should quit my job and spend the last of my savings on trying to get into artist’s colonies, because that’s what I’d really be doing with my life if I wasn’t wasting it, right?  OR I’d be in a band, yeah, yeah that’s it, where’s my guitar, pick it up and you go be a rock star RIGHT NOW, because when else will you do it, and then you’ll regret this for the rest of your life, and oh, ow, oh, shoot soap in my eyes, shoot, oh I’ll never be Jeff Buckley if I can’t even find the guitar cos I’m BLIND now, oh god what will become of me I just…oh lord.  I want coffee.   After the idea of sweet legal addictives came I calmed down somewhat.  However, I then had to get dressed, and in an act of defiant “my girlfriend’s not here to object and I’ll do what I want cos I’m my own person and I can have fun without her dammit” independence, I ripped this shirt from its hanger (actually I broke the hanger, I was so defiant) put on some Sean Lennon, and tried to avoid all the mirrors in the house because I like paisley.  Yes, yes I do.  What did I have to do today?  Oh, right.  Decorate. Ahem.  Well maybe I'll make that coffee first.

      I have the block.  and the block is haunting me.  Well, let’s not lie (You wouldn’t like that, would you?  To be implicated in my self-denial?  It would make you feel glum.  No, don’t argue with me, it would, so let’s spare you the misery.  There.  Better.  The iron thumb of truth will soothe you).  I’ve had the block for almost a year now, owing to the fact that my job requires more energy and made-up words and phrases which are then defined for jargon-onlookers by the haberdashery of isms and ologies created by the teaching profession.  I would write you a funny little anecdote of a jargonist and an onlooker trying to communicate— in fact that was my golden intention.  I would flurry through dialogue using phrases like “thinking work” and “YA novel” and “pedagogy” but let’s be honest.  I can’t.  I have the block.  If I didn’t have the block I could provide you with much better isms than that.  They might even have an ism in them.  My job, however, and its brain drain, is not the only problem.  My own uselessness in the encroaching summer whilst girlfriend finds herself a paying job and I sit and twiddle my thumbs longing for better days is weighing on me.  This seems to create two spaces in my brain; one, the place where all the collected materials blind themselves and bump into each other until falling down on the padded floor like wiggling insects, crying out “I was once funny!  I was once poetic!” and then vanishing in a blast of green goo, and the other place where the ideas escape to and attempt to put down roots, only to find that their garden paradise is stamped out by the grandfather clock foot of Time.  Whom I imagine to be a very big transformer-type fellow made of cherry oak who stamps on my shrubbery and booms: “Too much time.  Too much time.”  I’ve got to stop feeding that guy.  The result of this dichotomy, or dual existence, I suppose, as they are not that different really, is that I can’t write anything.  I have snippets of phrase and a bunch of character sketches and no plots or purpose.  Christina thinks therapy is in order but I’m tired of unleashing ideas in PMS fits of angst and then giving validation to them in order to achieve inner peace.  As I see it, the options are to either:  Turn into a raging alcoholic and write keroac-esque rambling blinding brilliance, which would be uncharacteristic given my wardrobe and ikea furniture, or  Return to my slut days where I could write about rejection and un-requited love and never mature beyond any kind of Elizabeth Wurtzel bitch defense mechanism and destroy the last shreds of feminist credibility we have today in my wake.   As neither of these appeal to me, I have repeatedly vowed to sit on my ass and produce nothing worthy of publication or submission.  I have stuck to this so rigidly, in fact, that I failed to even email Audra a copy of our bar-begun “Man-Camp,” for fear it might actually turn into a worthwhile exercise of wit and creativity.  Instead I invest most of my thought in whining about my girlfriend being MIA and how my pants don’t fit.  I need to think of a new alternative.  All attempts to avoid normalcy, of course, will be maintained.  Do not fret.  I will construct (shhh) an elaborate (shhh) and most assuredly doomed (shhh) solution (but—shhh) which will lead me into (there’s this town?  It’s called Shhh) triumph and rule over the planet.  Or at least a new health plan.

      Welcome back, Spelling Bee!  I've decided to reinstate this blog because I have too many genres floating about in my head, and for some reason they won't fit together in one space.  Also I'm tired of keeping my teenage angst livejournal and feel that a little more pep might be in order.  One would wish I could be creative and you might view this as "ooohhh!  ahhhh!  look how surprising and interesting...it's a poem, it's an essay, it's a new kind of spaghetti sauce!"  but i'm not.  So there.  Eat your Ragu and be happy.  A couple of days ago I was on the phone with Brayton (please note, much of my life takes place on the phone, as people-type interactions ended about three years ago now) and she narrated to me the dismay of not finding the particular type of Prego she desired on the shelf of her local mini-mart type store (in the pear we might refer to this as a "deli."  However I will wager to guess that the only type of meat product in cole valley Brayton could purchase in said-type establishment is the one we're about to get to, let alone anything with the boar's head label.  We usually go and purchase ice-creamables when i'm about.  none of the options that I recall involve chocolate-covered paper-thin sliced ham).  She found, in fact, that they did not carry Prego, but only it's bastard cousin, Ragu.  The options presented were original, mushroom, and meat.  She chose meat.  I suggested she perhaps choose original and add some type of animal to it later that she could purchase separately.  She declined my solution and said she could just add onions and pepper to this one.  Now, normally, I would not object that much to this type of decision.  I'm not a vegetarian, although my stomach lurches with great horror whenever we pass the cows at harris ranch on the way to Pasadena.  Still, I eat the beef.  My main objections, and desire for clarification really, to this purchase were the following:  How does Ragu desire to define "meat?"  Is "meat" a real food product, or an acronym?  And can you really be terribly sure that when they say meat, the little globules of M-E-A-T floating about in her tomato-based product like bubbles in bubble tea are in fact processed from a non-domestic non-crazy-like animal?  And how do they stay non-refridgerated?  does that whole sealed in a jar business really guarantee freshness?  What possesses a person to make this type of choice, say "oh, I really hope i don't get mad cow," and then actually go buy the product?  Once the words "mad cow" are out of your mouth, shouldn't you be more cautious?  Or was she banking on the fact that "meat" remained ambiguous, and to the best of my knowledge you cannot catch mad turkey or mad pig?  Anyway.  I haven't heard from Brayton since thursday, but neither have I heard from Deese, so I'm guessing all's well with the babies.

      As I sit here basking in the glow of my newly acquired vacation time and some chocolate Jello™Pudding, I cannot help but wonder this:  What in Jove’s name is the point of  urlLink Friendster?   Yes, I know it’s an old question.  I could write at length about classical music stations and how the announcers say things like “get out the smelling salts!” and then laugh at themselves in an NPR chuckle sort of way, only to pause and realize there’s no one laughing along with them.  I could.  Or I could write about this pudding some more.  But damned if I understand that elusive, tangled web of sense that is Friendster, and damned if I won’t try to figure it out.  I found out about Friendster around when everyone else found out about it, which is to say before all the articles came out and everyone else found out about it.  Yeah, I knew about it way back when everyone was joking “let’s call it F*ckster!” since we all assumed that was the point.  Actually I came up with that joke.  Well, actually I think one of the Cons (see below) I was living with at the time of Friendster’s release came up with that joke.  And she probably heard it from Sharon Stone, I bet.  Anyway.  At the time, we assumed it was going to be some kind of mass networking where one of two things would happen.  One, it would become a huge orgy where all of our friends hooked up with each other because “The internet said it was okay, in fact now there’s even a site for it so you don’t have to ask anyone’s permission or be all middle school about it like ‘Hey I like so and so but I have to go through you to see if it’s a viable option and if we share the same taste in beer or if you would be totally repulsed by the idea of two of your friends dating and therefore tell me she’s out of my league and I don’t have a chance in Hades.’  Plus it’s better than pursuing anonymous strangers via dating services because they might know someone we know and therefore be more acceptably sane and perhaps share interests.”  Or, alternatively, it would not allow us to do this, and therefore be pointless and a big flop.  We were hopeful, especially about cutting out the middle man and getting straight to those hot friends of friends in corners we saw at so-and-so’s oscar party.  Free email access!  And cute, albeit totally obscured thereby increasing the allure and curiosity, pictures of ourselves!  It’s like an ideal bar situation without the alcohol!  Ay.  There’s the Rub.  For you see, as everyone knows,  alcohol  is the main catalyst in stranger-friend hook-ups*, and without it, all interactions with stranger-friends consist of mainly:  “Hey did you hear what our mutual friend Sally did?” “Yeah she threw her ham sandwich at an office coworker and it stuck to the window.” “Yeah, crazy isn’t she?”  “Yeah, crazy.” “Yeah.” “Yeah.” “…” “…” “Um, so I have to go to the bathroom—“ “OKAY!”  Or, possibly, if you’re the kind of person who thinks because the two of you know the same person, you can take certain personal liberties, It might look like this:  “What kind of cheese do you like?” “…” “I have to go to the bathroom.” “…”  Which is just painful and you’ll both end up having independent conversations with Sally about what a jackass her other friends are, and could she please not introduce you to any more of her loser, fungus-obsessed depends-wearing compadres.  Cheese, indeed.  I suppose the creators of Friendster were hoping that screen-to-screen anonymity would substitute for the alcohol component and that stranger-friends wound manage to form their bonds with the safety of the delete key.  The problem with this, of course, is that damn middle man.  With a friend in common, you have no way of Telling the Lies about a)how you met, b)why you met, c)why you didn’t just ask your friend to introduce you, d)why you’re suddenly BFFs with your friend’s childhood boyfriend.  You also run the risk of having your new stranger friend blab to your old friend-friend what she really thinks of you, and vice-versa.  This makes Friendster a rather isolating, terrifying prospect in the great scheme of Meeting People.  Hence it morphed into what it is today; a completely useless social network in which people connect to everyone they’ve ever known in their life so that they can avoid talking to any of them, but safely keep them in a self-updating address book with pictures, to boot.  And now, I look at you, dear reader, and wonder.  Why, dear god, why?  Picture it (And now, I will).  This website has rendered thousands of us hopeful conversationalists into inarticulate, trendy, lying hipsters, who all claim that Infinite Jest is our all time  favorite  book, in a sad attempt to Meet New People that we were otherwise too shy to talk to.  Of course, painting a picture of yourself via an internet profile is no more successful at this than standing in the corner of an extremely crowded party in Manhattan and hoping you can somehow telepathically let the cute guy know that you are aloof, interesting, and solitary because you  want  to be, and that he is the only one among this crowd of recreants who has a mind enough to come talk to you.  You’re just waiting.  Waaaaaaaaaiiiiting.  Come over here, you toothless bastard! God-da—oh there goes my shoe.  Hey, will someone get my shoe?  Hey!  Indeed, wading through a sea of trendy intellectualism as a means of personal advertising can be even more ineffective than grabbing someone by the throat and screaming “I’M SMART!  LOVE ME!”  and then expecting them to want to buy a puppy with you.  Especially when the delineated rules of advertising oneself end up being a little less transparent than the social geographical map we created for ourselves in high school (Jocks go…here!  Ditzy popular girls go…here!).  It seems that to attract any surfers-by on Friendster, you have to create a Very Interesting and Otherwise Obscure Except Possibly to those Smart Enough To Get Me list, involving a list of favorite books, music, and movies; a list which can either make you a sensation or a cultural snafu in the eyes of the Friendster elite.   I, however, with my powers of batcave deduction, have discovered these rules, at least for books, and can now share them with you.  First of all, you get three books as your base, and from then on, it’s open season.  For this base, pick one book you don’t understand and/or have not read, one book you loved from childhood, and one book that everyone kinda knows but maybe hasn’t read yet.   For instance, my Friendster profile will read:  Henry Miller’s Tropic of Capricorn (No!  I haven’t read it!  I read the first page and it disgusted me, because I can’t get past his misogyny!  I’m sure this choice is ironic and somehow I’m missing the point, and you find me unoriginal and small minded!  Let’s avoid that!  It’s my favorite book!  I also think when you intimate the musical genius of this band that I have a sneaking suspicion is composed of your little brother and his 5 year old groupies banging away on the garbage cans in your backyard as we listen to it on your 8-track tape player which is totally and completely ironic as a return to the “simplicity of sound, I mean they really get it, you know, it’s like Jack White, or something, except he’s totally over, don’t you think?” that I will nod my head yes even though I’m sure neither of us have read the philosophical musings of Jack White and I only really have a vague idea of who he is or what it is he might be over since I myself am over a barrel of monkey-fun no idea BS right now but damn!  Yes!  The sound of breaking glass  is  music!  I’ll be humming that tune to myself for years to come!), Matilda (yes, it goes very well with Henry Miller on my bookshelf), and The God of Small Things (which, incidentally, is a good book).  Given that TV has more or less replaced other pastimes at home and caused (and you can ask Jonathan Franzen for confirmation on this, see, hah hah, I am well read, I even read  essays , and have a subscription to the New  Yorker , shut your  face , Malfoy) the average reader to go from digesting 25 books a year to 5, the chances of actually having read and re-read any of these books enough to make them favorites is slim.  Except for Matilda, which I personally have read about 25 thousand times.    Sad, Isn’t it?  The thorn of uncertainty that perpetuates all this violent image reconstruction and lonely scrutinizing was born in, yes, you guessed it (Once again!  You’re so smart!  You should be on Friendster).  High school.  That evil place from which I will never escape.  Friendsters, aka Hipsters (Let’s not beat around the bush anymore, shall we?  I live in Brooklyn.  We all knew what this post was really about), are composed of the leftover pool of geeky-intellectuals who were not quite popular in high school, but have found a new realm of delayed popularity in their 20’s, and whose intellectual insecurity supersedes their anxiety regarding physical appearance.  As I am  still  not cool enough to even really be a hipster (since I know next to nothing about music), but desire to attain literary celebrity and genius status, and fall into the right age-group, I flock to their crowds with a red pen and a drooling desire for approval, and thereby abandon my personal tastes to whatever intellectual superstar is cool to like at the moment (which is why I know all this stuff, and possess the cultural authority to deliver my message to you, dear reader).  Friendster seems the best tool to discover these waves of cool, because copied intellectualism is safer than transparent geekiness.  For instance, if I were to construct an accurate, honest Friendster profile, it might look more like this:  Favorite Books:  Matilda, Much Ado About Nothing, Arcadia, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, Keats’s Odes.  Which of course, is problematic for the following reasons:  1) The inclusion of three plays reveals me as a theatre geek, and therefore not as “deep” as someone who reads “real books.” 2) Everybody’s favorite book is Matilda, they even made a movie out of it, for crying out loud, so why are you lying about that? 3) People don’t read Shakespeare for fun.  Or Keats.  Let’s get a little more Post-Modern, please.  Which basically means, personality-wise, I’m screwed.  The other problem about Hipsters is that they’re all aware of their Hipster status and will vehemently deny it, in fact will go to great lengths to proclaim their anti-hipness, thereby making them even more attractive to the anti-pop-culture masses.  Oh, you’re actively un-hip?  I like you!  Let’s be un-hip together and scoff at those hip people trying to fit in over there.**  They’re so high school.  The result of all of this social awkwardness is, of course, Friendster.  Upon which we lurk and throw out our supposed best ideas of ourselves in hopes that someone will catch them and not let them die on the sidewalk like oversized flopping tuna.  We want to be cool.  We want to be sashimi.  We want to be minimalist accessories atop on an earth-toned plate of rice.  Therefore we sit around, compare, try to read books we hate, and remain too stunted to talk to anyone.  Except for those people who actually are cool, who are also on Friendster merely because they are unaware of the social masses below them, and just think it’s cute to have a little place where you list your favorite books.  Like Sharon Stone.  I think she might have a profile.   So what message do I leave you with?  People!  The above travesty does not have to be true!  I have seen people overcome the Friendster mores barrier.  The other day I posted a bulletin about buying a bike.  Everyone wrote and told me I was crazy.  And then told me to go on Craigslist.  People I hadn’t heard from in ages told me this!  They just hopped right over that “Hey how are you have you seem my music interests yet” obstacle and said “Are you insane?  You want to ride a bike in New York City?  Good luck to you, Foolio!”  Imagine that!  No “Sorry I haven’t talked to you in seven years, let’s catch up, after all my profile says I’m ‘Here to Help,’” no “Gosh, you look great!  I read Infinite Jest too!  Wasn’t that book fabulous!?” but just a plain old “You’re an idiot— Peace” and that was the end of it.  I felt a complete restoration of faith at the intimate crassness of stranger-friends, and their fearlessness when it comes to socializing, online or otherwise.  For what have we learned in this age of technology, if not that if you see someone acting stupid, it’s best to call it like it is?  No, it looks like any uncertainty about the use of Friendster stems soley from my own head, and if you share my assessment, looks like from yours, too.  I bet, though, that zillions of people would talk to us, if we had just read that damn book.  Maybe you should go read it now.  I know I will.       (Do you have that “WTF?” feeling, yet?)   (Good.  Peace be with you.)     *Or any kind of hook-up, for that matter.  Friend-to-Friend, Stranger-to-Stranger.  Or, if you ask the far right, Adult Male-to-Sheep at the Elvis Chapel.  As the right seems to have a particular idea about Things They Might Do If We Let Them.  **Yes.  I am aware of the irony.  What, I’m stupid now?  You identify my insecurity and then poke at it with fire-hot iron sticks?  Thanks.  Kind of you.

      So there’s this book?  I read?  Active verb to read you might be doing it now?  Called the Tipping point.  Evidently if you send a bunch of mail into the world to be reached by one person, that person can be reached by the aid of seven specific people.  These people are called “connectors.”  But, see, here’s the thing.  They can’t be reached right away.  They must be reached by a vast network of nobodies, whom are known as something else but for my intents and purposes let’s call them “not the connectors.”  Or, for convenient shorthand, “notcons.”  Now, I imagine, in my tiny literary celebrity obsessed world, that the life of a connector must be quite something.  I have a sneaking suspicion that I know a few connectors, even.  Even though there are only seven of them.  But see, that’s just it.  The life of a connector is not just hoards and hoards of mail coming across your desk, none of it for you but all for the very important people who can’t be bothered to even be a notcon, who are in fact the top of the heap, the “reasons for everyone else to go on living because one day they might be me, or at least noticed by me,” type people, or what we Americans like to call “Sharon Stones.”  Actually there’s only one of her.  And I do think that everyone, at some point, might like to send a piece of mail to Sharon and see what she thinks about their verve and wit, and maybe it’s even enough for her to stop over for a spot of coffee, and hey, wouldn’t that be hip?!  But I digress.  Connectors, you see, can keep their numbers down to only seven for two reasons.* 1) The human mind can really only remember up to seven figures at a time. 2) The phrase “anyone who’s anyone…” and the phrase “oh,  everybody  knows…” and also, recently I have come to believe, “rule the skool.”  THUS.  Thus thus thus.  Thus, you see, my dear reader, us notcons have been feeding into a web built up by the connectors on the basic principle that a) you won’t want to miss out on the fun and b) you can’t remember everybody’s name, so a con will just do it for you, and if you can only remember seven people’s names on your own, one of those people (or more) is going to have to be a con.  Then if everybody knows seven people, the cons can somehow space this out between them so that they know everybody.  I realize to some of you this might completely ignore the newfangled idea of “math,” but that’s just because you have failed to notice the humor of my slightly psychotic atonal egotistical streak, and that means you haven’t read anything before this.  So will your suspension of disbelief and continue, or go back to the beginning and get a feel for things before you start writing comments of explanation on why you can use logarithms and isosceles triangles to prove I’m wrong.  You’re just a lowly notcon, you think I care?  And there lies my point.  My point about the comments and my address book.  When I look through it, I realize everyone I know is linked through three, possibly four people.  I have a suspicion that these people are cons.  I maintain most of my other relationships through these few people, and without those links, I probably have no hope of seeing anyone ever again.  Of those cons I know who maintain blogs, they become instantly famous and gather at least 30 comments a day, usually from 30 of their separate closest friends.    Now, I have deduced that there are those of us notcons who became wise to the game early on in our formative years, and it made us jealous.  Yes, jealous, and bitter.  For we too, wanted to know everybody who’s everybody and to rule the skool.  But we only have a measly 5 comments spread out over our blog and very little mail and we can’t remember more than seven damn people’s names and phone numbers let alone where we keep our address book.  We can’t figure out how the cons do it.  How do they know so many people?  Where do they find the time?  Do they take a pill?  Is there a Connector Pill which is distributed by the CEO of cons?  Or is the CEO actually Sharon Stone, and she actually only has seven friends like the rest of us, but see, somehow, probably because of her movie career or some such thing, she managed to be the person the cons wanted to be cons for, and so she maintains her strict notcon network of seven con friends, and gets to be the notcon that made it into stardom, of which we are only allowed one.  We stay up for hours at night trying to determine the reasoning behind all of this.  We make maps, journals, bad folk songs about being a wised-up notcon.  And then we lose them, along with, yes, our address book with all the saved up names to elude the network of the cons.  Which drains us of all energy and causes us to fall down weeping and calling out “grandma!  I can’t find the chicken recipe again!”  Of course this doesn’t happen to all of us but if you keep your recipe book with your address book it might.  At any rate, it dashes all hopes of celebrity and the American dream and by god why wasn’t I born British.  At least then I could be a notcon with a cool accent.  In the midst of writing this I realize, as a notcon, none of my words will be read by you, reader, unless you are a con.  And if you are a con you will either, from the good of your heart, pass them along to Sharon, and she will come over for coffee and we can discuss the future I wasn’t born with, the celebrity I desire, and the wit I aspire to possess, and then she will pat me on the back and I will die happily.  But that would undermine your network, as then I might think to forget someone else I know and forge a direct connection with Sharon, and then who would need you?  So you won’t, and I will remain in notcon obscurity.  With no comments or advertisements on my blog except for those enforced on me, a victim of the self-help and Atkins aisles at the bookmart, wishing only that some hint of sparkly 15 fame minutes would bless me with its vaseline teeth happiness,  and I, too, could fulfill my destiny.  And Thus, my friends, cellulite cream is born.  Now to read Empire Falls.     *These are reasons which I have deduced as a notcon.  A sad, lonely, jealous notcon.

      Oh, to have been a film major.  Or even better, a dude working in a video store.  Yes!  Much, much better, in fact, because you get paid to throw your pedantic film philosophy at your customers as soon as they walk in the door, not to mention have the proof of your devotion and truthfulness blaring overhead!  And confuse them with FBI-sounding bibble-babble in the list of requirements to join your elitist organization, which surely can only be fueled by the drinking of finely cheapened beer and the bitter aftertaste of a liberal arts education!    Let’s back up a moment, shall we?  Today I wanted, shockingly, to rent a video.  Not just any video.  I wanted to watch Girl with a Pearl Earring, because, my dear reader, I am all about the sexy seventeenth century.  Or whenever it was.  I was into the sibilance just there, forgive me.  Anyway, yes!  I walked in and took one look at that picture of Scarlett Johansson and thought, “Hot.”  That’s what I thought.  It is.  Nah, dude, it is.  Check it out.  HAHT.  Ahem.  Sorry.  Yes so I took one look at the flowing, thick, multi-layered petticoated garments which screamed “you whore!” and found myself so titillated by her provocative doe-eyed expression on the front (and wow, does she ever look like the chick in the picture by that Vermeer guy!) that I picked up the case and marched myself up to the counter, armed with cash (at least five dollars, people, I’m rolling in it this week) and my address, which, thanks to my incredible skills of memorization, I know by heart now (yes!  points for lis!), ready to open an account.  As I approached the counter, I kind of took a quick inventory of the guy behind the counter, to see what I was about to deal with.  Usually I find that you can bet on two types of people to work in a small independent video store; the kind who really really care a LOT about what they’re renting you, and in fact will covertly replace the Disney film you’re about to rent for your screaming 4 year old because she just won’t settle for anything else but Aladdin singing with a black-and-white silent movie with Polish subtitles in order to expose your child to “real art,” and the kind who really don’t care and will either forget to take your money for your video, forget to give you change, or forget where they are in the middle of the transaction and start looking around for their keys or underwear or unfinished beer like they’ve just woken up and they’re not sure whose apartment this is.  My video guy, who looked a little like john cusack (warning!  foreshadowing!   urlLink foreshadowing! )  was rapt in watching  Monster  on the screen above our heads and it took him a minute to realize I was there.  Thus I had some time to decide that he was probably more on the chill side of “film buff.”  It wasn’t a totally obscure movie (it did, after all, win an oscar, which is how many film buffs make their yearly list of “movies to be burned and never mentioned in my household again unless you want to feel the burning wrath of lime juice in your eye, or maybe even something worse if I can reach that far” list), but then again it was a pretty political movie, too.  I was just glad for the moment he wasn’t watching Kill Bill part 1 so I didn’t have to hold back the sick.  Cos you know how I am about that kind of thing, and honestly, it’s already been a painful week.  I then joyfully asked if I could open an account.  “Okay well I’ll need proof of address, a credit card, your social security number, birth certificate, a photo id, another photo id, the expiration date on your last carton of milk, and a tic tac, if you have one, cos I’m really hungry but could settle for something with a minty fresh aftertaste.  God!  Can you believe they’ve made like 3 movies about this chick?  She’s a fucking hero!  What do you think of that?”  “Um, I don’t…I don’t have…all those…I’ve just come from…”  “Okay well make sure you bring all those things next time.  You’ll have to come back.  And don’t forget to bring the photo id.”  “Oh, ok, um, sorry, I…”  “That’s okay.  You have something in your hair.  It’s like a leaf or something.”  And then he went back to watching Monster.  And I scuttled back to replace hot, hot Scarlett, and then scuttled out, clutching the top of my head and searching frantically for the tree branch I was sure was growing out of it.  Well, really.  What kind of clandestine operation are they running, that he asks for all those things and then tries to confuse me with some kind of politics and ethics question at the end?  You can’t ask a person for that kind of data all in one go and expect an intelligent answer!  My God!  It strikes me that this is, perhaps, how these people maintain their superiority.  By combining requests for personal identity-theft vunerable information and political analysis and ideology all in the same sentence, they thereby disorient the client into believing that a) “it is necessary and right to require me to put you into my will as the sole inheritor of my estate in order to rent this plastic recording of movie actors” and b) “you are much, much smarter than me, as I suspect you can answer that question and I cannot, since I am still reeling from your request for my car keys in exchange for this plastic recording of movie actors.  Because you are much, much smarter than me, I will concede to part a, and, really, anything else you ask me for regarding my personal identification and monetary assets.”  But see, I kept my wits, because my video store guy got a little too sure of himself.  He added an extra move into this delicate balance of paranoia and ego, and that was this:    He tried to flirt with me.   Hah hah.  Stupid man.  Trying to flatter me by noticing ugly caterpillar-looking tree mold sitting atop my head.  Well, buddy, I’m taken, and your little ruse didn’t work.  Hah hah!  I’m going to go to blockbuster, where they know nothing and will sell me candy for the price of my living room furniture!  That’s Right, $200 for jujubes!  Don’t YOU feel sheepish!  Dammit.  No.  I don’t know.  They’re smarter than  everyone in the world.   You just  can’t  argue with the video store guy.  I’m sorry.  I thought I had the answers for you on how to get out of there a whole human being.  But I don’t.  We’ve been had.  I think they might be clones.  Jesus.  Keep your kids out of there, Okay?  Thanks.  Thanks a lot.
