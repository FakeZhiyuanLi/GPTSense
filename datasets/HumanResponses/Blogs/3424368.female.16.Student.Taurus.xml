I went to see Gerardo... and then him and Gabor and I walked to GP, so they could see old friends, and so I could see Allie!  And yep, I did!  She's doing good =) And so is Trinity!  She's soooo cute!! =)  But yeh, she wants me to call her more, so I shall! lol... and yeh, I "met" some of Gerardo's friends... they all seem like good people =)  So yeh, for the time I was there, I was Gerardo's Girlfriend... not that I'm not now =P  But yeh, lol, that was my name!  haha, no complaints.  Yep... I had fun, tho.  Then yeh, we went back to his house for a while, and now I'm home!  And YEH, I got an email from Roxie... =O MAN, I'm shocked, and disappointed... Not in her, but in the news I heard.  =( It's a shame.  But yeh, that's all for now!

      I REALLY need to vent... *sigh*... here goes... So, I guess that today hasn't really been a great day for anyone, huh?? =(  That sucks, a lot.  This morning, when I woke up, I was in a horrible mood... I felt soo sick, and just not good at all.  But, last night, I agreed to go for a run with my brother this morning... so, he came to wake me up.  And yeh, we did go out,... but, it's so messed, because I couldn't run at all.  Well, in the beginning, we were running,... but, after that, I just couldn't do it.  My chest started hurting soo much,... I needed to lie down.  So, we weren't out for long.  We were out for about half an hour, and that's it... so, I came home and lay down.  Man, I need to go to the doctor's soon,... but, I really don't want to know what's wrong,... because, if I don't know, then I can always say it's nothing, right?  And then yeh, I went to school, earlier than I have in the past weeks... and, I went in to talk to Mr. Henderson, to apologize and explain myself to him, for missing his classes.  He understood,... and, I felt better after telling him.  And yeh, I   did   plan on going to his class... because we have a concert coming up this tuesday, and I haven't played for like, a month! So, I wanted to go... BUT, as I was walking to the class, I ran into Rukhie, and yeh, she's like, LET'S SKIP!  I didn't want to,... but, I've sayd before, I'd skip with her over going to class ANY day!  WHICH WAS STUPID ON MY BEHALF.  I talked to the teacher, and then I skip.  Retarded?! Just a little.  Then yeh, I ended up upsetting my boy, too... because normally after block d, I go to his class to pick him up... but, we ended up being late getting back to school, so I couldn't go to get him.  I know that I let him down, and I felt bad for that.  And, he was also kinda upset that I skipped, because I had asked him NOT to let me skip anymore, yet, I did it anyways.  *sigh* I'm not too smart, huh?  And then yeh, I went to math, feeling soo sick... and, I was just not in a good mood, and I think I kinda gave Roxie the wrong impression, as though she'd upset me, which wasn't the case at all.  But yeh, I told her that Gerardo wanted to talk to me at lunch,... and, I kinda figured that it was a bad thing, even tho he told me that it wasn't.  And then yes, I sat infront of my locker, waiting for him,... then Winnie came up and told me that he needed to stay in class to work on his project... so yeh, that got to me.  So, I decided to continue writing a letter to my mom, you know, just explaining things to her.  That's when I ran into Roxie and Luanne, and, Roxie's not stupid... she knew something was wrong... and yeh, I was ready to ball, but I figured that it'd be best if I didn't.  So, I started walking to the library so that I could write, and that's when I ran into Gerardo.  He didn't look to happy,... to be honest, he looked a little mad... so my thought was UH OH.  But yeh, I talked to him, and he told me what was on his mind,... and yeh, it's that he was upset that I skipped.  But yeh, lunch came and went, along with my last two classes... and then, IT POURED!  MAN, that was a lot of rain.  As we walked towards my house, my boy and I walked thru many puddles, altho, I did a lot more =) hehe.. But yeh, when I got home, Isaac wasn't feeling well... and, I also recieved a phone call from Roxie, and she was upset... and then I felt like hitting her boyfriend, but, I know I can't.  I know that he can be really sweet, and that he makes her happy... and, that's good for her... =)...  Mmmm... and then yeh, after I got off the phone with her, I went back to my room with Gerardo, and, outta no where, I just started crying.  Man, I don't know what's wrong with me.  Actually, everything probably is... There was no reason why I was crying... I guess, bottled up feelings were surfacing... I don't know. He got worried, but I told him that nothing was wrong... because, I couldn't really explain, cuz I didn't really know myself what was wrong.  But yeh, he ended up going home a little bit later... and now, here I sit,... writing this,... and, I realized that I've sayd a lot, and babbled on and on about my day, when really, it wasn't necessary.. but, oh well.  I'm not liking today,.. but, I guess days like today are inevitable.

      Today has been such a good day! =) WOW... lol.. yeh, I woke up in a good mood, so that started it.  My classes were all pretty good, too... weird, eh??  I went to talk to Mr. Kaukus today... and, surprisingly, we talked a lot.  He's a pretty good guy... and he's got his ear pierced too.  How crazie is that? =P... UHM, he explained a lot of things to me, and yeh, he heard me out with the things that I wanted to say.  Then, I asked him about Alicia.  Since grade 8, she would be the one I'd go to talk to if I had a problem... she was and still is such an awesome mentor =)  So yep, he told me that she'd been back for 3 weeks, but she hadn't come to drop by the school yet.  But yeh,... I think talking to him helped me,... a LITTLE bit.  But yeh, then lunch came, and I went with Roxie to the Shell... and there was the cutest puppy!! MAN, I would soooo take her, but yeh, I was told no =(  But that's ohkiee, cuz I have my puppy!! hehehe... And then, yehh, I went to Math, and as always, it was boring... but, at 1ish, guess who came?! ALICIA!! MAN was it good to see her!  And yeh, she took me outta class, hehe... and, we talked for about half an hour.  I really did miss talking to her... but yeh, I told her lots, and she told me things, too... and yeh, she did make me feel better.  She's totally awesome!  And, when it was time to say goodbye, it was still good... because she sayd the most encouraging thing that I've heard in the LONGEST time.  She is such an amazing person.  Then yeh, English came and went, and then I came home.  I was here with Gerardo... and yeh, he was being a dork, like always... but I love him hehe... and yeh, he was on msn, and I realized that he is SUCH A FLIRT!  But, I guess it's ohkay right, cuz yeh, they are his friends... lol, altho, you wouldn't think so =P  mmmmm.... but yeh, that's all for today,... or yeh, for now.  Best day this week! =)

      I don't know why I'm writing this.. I guess it's because I feel bad now.. I mean, she sayd it's nothing, but, it is something,.. it's bothering her, and, as a friend I'm supposed to be there for her.  But that's the thing,.. I've been such a bad friend to everyone lately, especially to the one I know I should be paying more attention to, and to the one who's always been there for me, even when I was a brat and deserved no one.  I feel bad for letting this friendship die, and I know that I can take full responsibility for that.  I read her journal,.. and, I don't know what to say to it.  I know she's feeling crummy, but I don't know what to say anymore.  I'm scared that if I open my mouth to say anything to her, I might make her mad... and, I've done that all too much.  I just wish I could be a better friend to her, like I know I  should  be.  And, I know that lately, I've been selfish,... I've been spending all my time with my bf, and I've been neglecting her, when that's the last thing I'd ever want to do... altho, I guess it doesn't really seem that way at all.  A great friend I am, huh?  Repaying the one who deserves the most, but treating her so horribly.  I'm surprised she still is my friend.  I owe so much to her,.. and, I know that I haven't sayd it lately.. and, I don't say it enough... but, she's the one I need to thank for so much.  She's done so much for me, and I don't deserve any of it.  I'm so outta the loop now, that I don't even know what's going on in her life.. and, I call myself her best friend.  Man,... I do feel horrible,... and, nothing's going to change that,... because, I AM horrible... and, that's the truth... there's nothing more to it.  I couldn't be more of a horrible friend... agh,... I'm sorrie...

      MAN, kay.. this morning, I was up at 5:10, cuz my brother and I were planning on going for a run.  And yeh, he sayd he'd come and wake me up at 5:30... so, I fell asleep, and he never woke up either =P  So, that was it for our "6 a.m. run" this morning.  When I woke up, it was about 7:45ish, and I had to go and wake myself up.  I looked like CRAP!  Then, Gerardo shows up at my house 15ish minutes later, and he whips out a camera and he's like "PISHURR!? =)" And I'm like OMG NO! but yeh, he didn't take any pictures, so that's good.  UHMM, I spent lunch with him tho, so yeh, that was fun.  We came back here so that I could turn off the alarm, cuz he wanted to come back here for last blk, cuz he hadn't done his h/w and didn't feel like going.  So, yeh, he came back here and he fell asleep in my bed... so cute =P  But yeh, my door was unlocked =| So, I was scared for him and my house, hahaha. But yehh... I feel bad about skipping and everything, because yeh, I don't want to go to any of my classes, but I've missed so much... MAN, I'm stupid. I'm not skipping another class... except, on friday, I'm going for the first couple blks, because I have a math test, and I think we're writing our essays for our final in english, too... so I'll just go home at lunch or something.  But yeh, anyways... uhmm... so I came home, and yeh, I was here with my boy for a bit... and that idiot ( I love you =P ) gave me this huge hickey on my neck.  I was like WTH!  That was the fastest I've ever seen anyone give one... he was like, on my neck for 3 seconds, and that was it. =| FREAK! MAN... ugh... and yeh, my grandma's gonna be here soon, and yeh, I don't exactly want HER to see it. =(... oh well. And yeh, my EFBF went to choose her courses today, so that's good... I'm sooo happy that she's gonna be there with me next year.  It's gonna be lots of fun... hehe =)  I hope that we get SOME classes together! We better!! ...  But LOOK! It's RAINING!! =)  I've missed the rain soooooo much!! I love it!! Isn't it awesome?!  I think so.. hehe...  ANYWAYS, I've got to go get ready for JS, and finish up my h/w and stuff...  GO OUT & ENJOY THE RAIN-SHINE! =)

      Who wakes up at 9 in the morning on a holiday!? AGH,... well, I had to.  And, I basically wasted another day.  This time tho, it wasn't my fault.  But yeh, I was out back for a while, and you know, it was sunny out, and the day was beautiful, so I tanned =P  I got lazy tho, so it's just my front.  I was reading my book, which I started a long time ago, and never really finished, haha.  I *was* supposed to go see Gerardo today, too... but, again, I didn't get the chance to do that.  I feel bad... cuz yeh, I know that he gets pretty bummed out when I can't make it to go see him. =( [..Sorry Baybie Boy!..]  And yeh, my dad's also being a jerk right now, which I'm NOT liking. ARGH,... but whatever.  And yeh, I found out awesome news from a close friend of myne about her and her love... unofficially tho.. but, it's in their hearts,... so it's all good! =) hehe... Yep, and right now, Roxie's sending all these sites to me, which are making me smile.. so I'ma be in a good mood when I go to bed, which will be soon =P... hehe... But yeh, this one really stood out to me... so go to it!   http://www.wordsofjoy.com/IWG.htm

I want to see him tomorrow, but I really don't know if I'll be able to...  *sigh* .... I haven't done anything today either... I was just with my parents and brother in the garage,... we chased out this giant mouse.. SOOOO gross! haha,... anyways... it's a nice day out, and I'm not gonna waste it inside... so I'm heading out back to try and tan my legs... haha, stupid white legs.  DON'T WASTE YOUR DAY! It's GORGEOUS! =)

      We all know that I love sleeping in, but it's only fun when I know the time.  My stupid clock stopped working,... so, it was 8:20 for a very long time!  argh, anyways... I am tired tho, cuz I waited until 12:15ish for my baybie to call... but yeh, he was out with this dad and got home late.  But, he called this morning, and he wants to go for a walk in Green Timbers Park... so, I might go out.  If not, I'll be stuck at home, doing nothing, on another boring sunday! =(

I miss her a lot, and yeh, altho we don't talk a lot, she's been such a big help in my life, and she's always gonna be someone important to me.   AND.. I talked to my baybie boy, too! He's good.. he didn't get in trouble or anything... but he did have to go to the doctors... poor thing. But, he's got medicine.. I hope he gets better soon!  ANYWAYS, I'm all smiles now.. so yay! =)

      Kay... so this is my first "blog"... but only because I have no life, and writing is the easiest way for me to express myself.   I'm sooo worried about my baybie boy... I haven't heard from him, and I want to talk to him... I feel terrible, because what if something happened with his parents because of me?!? MAN, this sucks... *hopefullY* he calls soon... Last night, I had a kickass time with Rukhie & Michelle... altho, at times, we had no idea what we were doing.  We saw SHREK 2! =) It was awesome... but those stupid boys behind us... argh,... yeh, anyways.  Then, on the way home, some ugly fat guy mooned us! =| SCARY!  But yep, Rukhie stayed the night, which I missed sooo much!! Cuz yehh... I miss my old friends...  New friends are great... but never forget the old ones... I love you guys!

      So, today was the last day of school.  For the most part, it went pretty well.  I mean, nothing happened.  I didn't see a lot of people... but, that's because I got there kinda late.  My report card was... uhmm... It was my report card.  Yup.  I passed everything,.. haha, lucky me! =P... Luanne wasn't there tho, so I was sad =(  I'm gonna miss her sooooo much when she's gone this summer.  *sigh*  Things are alright tho,... I mean, right now, I really dont have much to say,... I have a lot on my mind right now, and I'm feeling a lot of different things, but I don't know.. things just seem to be weird, I guess.  Hmm... OH, on friday I'm gonna go with Marci & Gerardo to go watch Shrek 2... hehe... I love that movie sooo much!  I could see it over and over and over again.  It's gonna be a lot of fun, because I've never been out with Marci before,... so yay =)  Yup yup... that's about all I have to say for now...

      I missed this!! haha.. I'm a loser!  After a month and a bit, I finally get my computer back.. and my internet doesn't work! AGH! I'm on dial-up right now, which REALLY sucks.. but oh well.  Over the past FOREVER, so much has happened.   School has ended.. which really sucks, because of next year.  I can't believe that I'm actually leaving.. I guess that the fact that I'm gonna have Roxie there with me helps a lot.. but, to know that I'm gonna be leaving so much behind... man,.. it's hard... AND depressing =( Tomorrow the actual last day of school... and yeh, I know that I'm going to be crying, a LOT... there's so many people I'm gonna miss... man... this is tough...  Guess who called me today?  Bhaggy!  Man, I haven't talked to her in SOOO long... but yeh, the year that I'm leaving... she goes back!! MAN... it's alright tho, I guess...  Right now, I'm supposed to be typing up my resume.. HA,.. I need to drop it off tomorrow... or, atleast sometime soon because next week... AND, if I actually do get the job, like, for real... then I'm gonna have no time for ANYTHING this summer!! But, the money is good =) lol..  Some time soon, I need to get together with everyone, and just spend time with them... because yes, I need to!!  Playland and PNE, definitely have to go! MAN, when would I go!? AGH... lol... I need to plan this... but yeh, I need to hang out with Roxie.. Laurie.. Karen *hope all is well*... Rukhie&Michelle.. Marci.. Matt.. my boy, of course...( and luanne.. but she's leaving tomorrow *cries*.. have fun! ).. and yeh, when I get to TORONTO, I need to get a hold of PRERNA! =) I miss her........ But yeh, anyways..  HMMMMM... there's not much else I want to say right now... so, yehh... my life bores me =P

           So, it's the weekend... well, the weekstart =P And, I am bored.&nbsp; Last week was so tiring, working everyday... but, on friday, I got paid!! yay! more than I expected! hehe, it was great.&nbsp; But, yeh, I haven't done much this weekend... I planned on sleeping a lot... but yeah, that didn't happen.&nbsp; Yesterday tho, I did go out with Gerardo... cuz yeah, we didnt get to do anything on wednesday, which was our 9 month anniversary! hehe, but yeah... We went to Metro yesterday,... and then walked around Bear Creek Park... but, that's about all.&nbsp; And tonight, we're going out to vancouver to have dinner with my brother.&nbsp; But ohh!&nbsp; On thursday, I was just looking thru some things, and I found my friend's number, from vancouver, and decided to call her up... it's was great! I haven't talked to her in&nbsp;a few years.... and then she sayd that I should call up another one of my old friends... so I did... we talked for sooo long... lol.. I havent talked to her since I moved, which was like, 6 years ago... so it was good to hear her, and talk to her again.&nbsp; And then, because i didnt have the number, I emailed my other friend... and yes, her and I talked... so I was happy to hear from all of them, and get a chance to catch up on SOME things with them =) But anyways... there's a spider crawling on the wall in front of me... and it's scaring me, so I'm gonna get going... bye!

      OH MY GOODNESS!  Work is hard!  Actually, no it's not... but, standing up for the whole day is damn hard! =(.. man, my legs hurt so much.  *cries*  And, I'm so tired, too.  I was sposed to go there early, right??  Well, the guy didn't even get there until 7, so it was pointless =P  Guess what, tho?  Lynn works there, so it's good, cuz at least I know someone!  I'm so glad it's the weekend... cuz I don't think I could stand doing that again.  Then agian, it was only my first day.. so, I guess I'll get used to it.  But, if it gets to be too much, then I might just quit and go do something else instead.  *sigh*... work, is a lot of work... =P

      I haven't done much lately... actually, I haven't really done anything at all since the summer started.  I doubt I'm going to get that job.. I don't really want it anyways,.. I'd rather do something interesting, like volunteer at a daycare, or the SPCA... atleast that way I'd be enjoying what I'm doing, right?  I haven't really seen a lot of people either.  The only person I've really seen is Gerardo, not that I'm complaining or anything,.. but there are so many other people that I want to see and hang out with this summer. Oh, I went to the movies last friday with Marci, and DM was there, too.. so it was kool to see him =)..  I haven't hung out with Roxie either.. I saw her yesterday, but it wasn't for that long really.. and we didn't do much... altho, the computer did tell us that we were a man =P... and, I haven't seen Rukhie either... I really wanna see her and hang out with her, cuz I miss her a lot.  I ran into Allie the other day... and Trinity! She's so adorable!  But yeh, I want to get together with her too, cuz I miss her a lot.  And, I've talked to Holly.. she's here now, and I'm glad.. cuz that means that I can see her soon... She'll be there with me next year too, so that's a comforting thought.  But, like the title of this blog says, I am BORED, I've been BORED, and I'll probably remain BORED.. so, please, SAVE ME! Boy, I'm a loser!
