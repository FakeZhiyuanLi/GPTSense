       I have officially seen the weirdest movie ever made.  A Japanese flick called Tomie: Forbidden Fruit.  I'm not even going to venture into attempting to describe the "weirdness".  You'll have to rent watch it for yourself.  Fucking weird.

       I was at Blockbuster looking to rent a good movie which in and of itself can be a problem.  At least 90% of what you find sitting on the shelf is complete shit and the more copies they have of something the worse the movies seem to get (quantity versus quality?).  In my experience the movies that tend to be the best are the ones they only carry one or two copies of.  For example, A Station Agent is probably one of the better movies I've seen in a while and how many are on the shelf? Three.  Once Upon a Time in the Midlands? One.  Yet to the left and right sit 100 copies of "generic, big budget, poorly written, overexposed, blockbuster".  There is so much crap littering the shelves you have to pay close attention while browsing or you'll pass up the two copies of the "well written, perfectly directed, special effect lacking, meaningful" movies that most people tend to ignore.  What did I end up renting?  Err... 13 Going on 30.  Jennifer Garner is just too fucking adorable.

       Lately I’ve been spending time perusing international volunteering websites, mainly the Peace Corps.  I have had this desire to join the Peace Corps for I don’t know how long and after spending some time with a girl who had volunteered I am pretty intent on following through.  A friend of mine asked me why and I had trouble conveying my reasons to him.  Recently I've been questioning the path my life is taking.  I have this desire to matter and justify my own existence and I feel the ideal way to do that is to somehow make a difference in the world.  Whatever shaped humanity, be it god or destiny, must have had higher expectations for the people of this planet.  There has to be a point to life.  Why are we here?  It can’t be to spend our lives trying to get ahead of the next guy.  I doubt that god sat back one day and said, “I’m going to create a planet and fill it full of people and instead of helping one another and making this world of my creation a better place I want them only to concern themselves with making a little bit of cash, getting some ass, and watching Outback Jack.

       Over the past three months I have been engaged in a book I am attempting to write.  Unfortunately after flying through 150 pages of a what I felt was strong writing I am considering revising most of what I wrote.  Although the subject is serious I feel the need to infuse it with humour to give it a "human" feel.  I think for many of us one of the ways we cope with a bad or diffucult situation is through humour.  After I went back and read through what I had written I realized just how "foreign" it felt lacking it.  Hopefully the revision won't take me forever and I can get everything wrapped up.  I'm interested in seeing a few reactions to it.

       “A priest, a rapist, and a pedophile walk into a bar, and that was just the first guy.”  The old adage “it’s funny ‘cause it’s true” definitely comes into play here.  I find it utterly amazing how people who hold the highest positions of virtue seem to completely lack it.

       I have been looking for a new place for a few months now and finally found someplace ideal. Despite the fact that it's downtown and relative large it wouldn't have broken my bank account. Think New Orleans in Indy. It definitely had that sort of vibe. I talked with the leasing agent/owner and she said it would be available at the beginning of this month as the current tenants lease would be up. Perfect timing! I offered to pay a deposit but she said it was not neccesary because (and I quote) "I look like a man of my word." I'm betting she would have asked for a deposit if it wasn't for the suit. Well I swung by today to inquire about renting now that it was empty and low and behold she had already rented it out. Nice huh? She told me that she didn't think I would be coming back and didn't have time to wait all month to rent it out. After pointing out that it was only the second day of the month she said, "Well you should have been here yesterday!" I of course told her to go fuck herself and went back to work. Now I'm back on a quest for a nice place downtown.

       “Don’t trust anything that bleeds for a week and doesn’t die.”  I was surfing the internet today and came across that line on YDGJ and as odd as incongruous as it sounds it sparked a desire to start a blog.  When I read that line it made me laugh out loud and I said to myself, “I have to remember that one.”  But I wouldn’t have as I didn’t remember hundreds of things that I wanted to remember. So I figured it would be fun to start a blog so I could remember those things that I wanted to.  Plus with all the random thoughts and ideas that shoot through my head throughout the day it will be nice having a place to keep them alive.  So with that, on with the blogging.
