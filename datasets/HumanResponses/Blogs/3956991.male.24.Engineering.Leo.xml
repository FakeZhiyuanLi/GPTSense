						   i know i said i was only going start writing a few days before leaving to UK but i decided i'll start writing now anyways...  things are kinda scary now in my life...things a seemingly more and more certain that i'm actually gonna go to the UK  all my friends want to come send me off, to be honest i really don't want anyone there, even my parents. it was suppose to be the happiest day of my life. back in march i saw this beautiful ring, diamond ring ofcourse, it was very simple white gold band with a small piece of diamond on it. i wanted to give that ring to a very special person in my life, just before i board the plane. not as an engagement ring but as a promise ring. a promise that i'll always think of her when i'm there, a promise that i will return for her, a promise that when i'm settled, the first thing i do is ask her hand in marriage. but in april out of the blue, she said she doesn't love me anymore. so ricardo if you're reading this i guess you'll know why i don't want you to come send me off. it'll be cool if you guys were that as originally planned, me giving the ring to her infront of everyone, making my promise as my friends&nbsp;and family as witness, but i guess you're right...shit happens!

						   okay, on monday my best friend was ver very depressed and i spent the whole day making a gift for a woman who doesn't love me anymore...but i still love her with all my heart, so it was worth it then tuesday, me and him had one of the most unforgeable road trip down to melacca (which we should forget), which made me very very depressed. then wednesday, me went and booked my flight ticket to UK. today thursday, i feel like just curling up dying (ppl who want to die never do, but ppl who want to live always end up dead) tomorrow friday, another friend of mine is flying of to Aus... hope the weekend gets better...it should, it Grand Prix weeked.
