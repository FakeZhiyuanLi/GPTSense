During Phy lesson, he told us tat our class is like a piece of damn bloody shed. Later at 1430h u better report to him or else say gdbye 2 science. Aft reporting 2 him at 1430h, he started scolding us for 1hr, he damn bloody idiot. Y he has the bloody right 2 scold us? Huh! He said: "Gals, do find a rich husband" making the bois felt insulted mann. What the ****? He also said tat for those having personal problems or relationship, put tat aside n concentrate on ur studies. What abt those who got stead? They definitely will think he's insulted them.

       1st Diary for today Fri the 13 of Aug 2004  Hai! I so, so, so, so & so sianz mann! Yesterday was a bad day 4 me. I only get C6 for the Mid Yr 'O' Level Mother Tongue n my MT oral get a Pass. Mayb compo, cloze passage &amp; compre sections causes me to get such a low grade. Congrulations to Cheng Lee (the tall gal in case u dun know n also known as Jasmine) & Dong Hui cos they no need to retake at the end of the yr as they scored A1 &amp; A2 respectively. Very shock tat Dong Hui scored A2 cos he is from China so his Chi should b very gd. Feel so down abt tat. How will i feel if i get the same score as them? Hmm...... Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha! Just joking n dreaming only! 2day leh, 4 Maths, we watch a 10min video abt students talking abt life in Temasek Poly. Mr Chinoh mentioned y we should work very hard, to get into poly n to do the courses tat u like. 4 the Mid Yr 'O' Level Mother Tongue results released yesterday, most of us done below our expectation. So during Chi lesson, Mr Ngm gives us a evulation form to fill in. The form tell us to comment y each one of us had done below expecation n what each person did b4 the exams n also give suggestions on how 2 teachers n school help us improve. Aft sch, i was chatting with Shera, Naz &amp; Raihana, i saw Sherry. Not sure if she staring at me or not. Mayb she got SPP. Well nvm, just ignore it. Hai! Tml (Sat) is Mass Run 2004, it'll b held at Bedok Reservoir Pk, so early had 2 wake up cos it starts at 7plus in the morning.
