      ok my couple of days off from work are about to end soon. I felt I was getting some things accomplished on line this week. I still have to fix the mistakes at the other diary page.  No, no I won't drop the name here.  I found some more graphic resources this week that was a plus. I must admit you can go only so far with the kind of graphics I am doing. Which leads me to my next project making the graphics myself.  In my frustration I tend to do things my own way. It takes me a while but I eventually do it. God I need more hard drive space!  I need a new computer!  Don't know when my next day off is? Got to go, wishing wet dreams for everybody :P

      before I do research on my bloggy idea, I want make a reality check list.   Listed below is what has been either broken or going wrong with me. This has all happened in the past week.  Things all break at the same time.  I hate it. Is it all over yet? Will more things break or go wrong?  static electricity: I get shocked all the time. At home and at work. It is starting to be painful.  My cats even avoid me I have shocked their little noses one too many time. Poor Murphy and Lilly,  I am sorry. I do what I can but my heating system is not well equiped.  My kids say it is me.  I don't think so.  And if Jay keeps telling me that I need to drink more water he is going to get a water on him.  I drink alot of water already.  dryersheets: Humm now this product is supposed to reduce the static in our clothes.  I got a killer shock from the laundry and bought these thingies.  Well it only helped a bit.  I am still getting shocked. I swear someone is trying to kill me.  washer hose: Well this thing had a nice bubble on it.  Thanks to Jay he noticed it and brought it to my attention so I didn't have water everywhere before I did the next load of laundry.  And the sweet guy that he is he fixed it for me today.  Yeah Yeah Yeah the guy I threatened with the water. Water is good. Water is clean.  He will adjust.  (he knows I am kidding) I also found out where all the socks go when I do the wash. Behind the washer!  Hey bloginfinger go check behind the washer for socks. hahaha  thermostat: This thing just stopped and it is in the middle of winter.  I had company coming over the next day.  We were so cold that night.  I knew how to do it and I wanted to do it myself but the timing was bad ( long story). I do have proof that I can install one though. I am not that hopeless.  Yes Jay helped me installing this also.  He really is good. :)  heating filter: Since the heater is working with such efficiency I thought new filters might help us breathe better. My heater was working poorly and I think still needs a tune up or something.  But before the repairs the downstairs was so cold all the time and upstairs was very hot.  It has evened out now.  This amazes me.  I have no idea why but it does.  Humor me I am a lost soul sometimes.   phone plate: This sucker has been broken for two years now. The phone was disconnecting in the middle of conversations. And recently it was hanging from a wire out of the wall. hahaha ( bad homeowner)  I got this done finally!  I was almost down to one phone in the house. A bad thing for me.  hehehe   oh and my favorite rogaine:  I might have to try this stuff but I am not ready for it yet.  My sister keeps telling me " I really cannot believe how thin your hair is getting.  You look like Aunt Lucille."  Aunt Lucille was almost bald before she died.   This is not a compliment and my sister is 11 years older than me.  My sister has a full thick head of hair.  Don't ya love sisters who point things out like this. Well at least it wasn't my mom who would not only point it out but announce it in front of others.  Oh my I had to say that, damn it might come true then.  I should shut up.

      Its been a long time since I have felt the need to post on here.  I have recently decided to pull away from alot of my on line activities.  I am doing some serious introspective thoughts on the work I love to do.  I have never felt I am the best and the brightest at web design or computer graphics, but I can do things that have made other people happy with my results. I help them for what they need on line. It get great pleasure out of helping others. I am proud of what I have done even when I walk away and think I can do better.  I still did it and the challenge is good for me.  I learn constantly which ingnites a fire in me. Not many things in my life have this effect on me. So this thing that I do I am keeping to myself. I am not letting anyone take this little happiness away from me like they have done in the past.  I am pulled in so many different directions to do for others and I do them without hesitation. That is why I sometimes have slow results when finishing a job but it gets done.   This thing that I do is apart of me now. Just like my kids and I we are stuck together like glue.  The little vermin that they are hahahaha!  As my little one would put it "love you for forever mom!"  "Same for me sweetie!" :)  Now for the day time job I go to well I am working 5 days a week. I love this job it is not perfect but the best job I have had in years. The employees are nice and bosses are nice. They work around my hours. THE PAY IS SUCKY! No way around it... it just sucks the big ol wiggola. I was offered a management position but the company reduced the perks of the job. The most important perks in my opinion. For starters money was reduced cause the job is now classified as perminant part - time. What a nice little loop hole to not pay an employee. This also means no insurance benefits.  OHhhh isn't that sweet and caring of them.  Yep, I declined the position.  I like my flexability so I am able to be home with my children.   Now today was fun at work. We got a truck of new product in for the summer season. This stuff we all have fun with. The the two managers and I always vote on what will be a good seller. Cute stuff came in. Very summery. But this one thing that came in was called a banana holder?  I am gonna pay $19.99 for something to hold my bananas? Whatever happened to a fruit bowl on the table?   Now I understand I should not be confusing this with a banana hammock. A totally different entity all together.  To be honest I think the concept would be better for the fruit also. Now the banana holder is hook made of steel and wood and the hammock is made of cotton. I would think the hammock is more practical don't you?  You gotta keep them safe so they don't go soft or bruise. I really think this banana hammock idea is better for a bunch of bananas on my table than that steel hook holder thingy anyday.   Now the original banana hammock that holds the other kind of fruit well lets admit it thats the best fruit there is.  Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh. :)  I am gonna try to put up Alton Browns website on this blog.  I think he is a trip and I like his show. If you visit his website I posted, go to his rants and raves page and see his post dated March ohh something or other I forget. OHHH damn!! I am old expect this from time to time.  Well...he has some Martha Stewart comments that had me rollin on the floor.

      I wanted to get back into the swing of things on my day off.  It is a monday and I am home alone to get some of my online and graphic work done. No such luck. I put a link up at the top here to see if what I made will show up this way.  I put it in the code of this template but you should see a little red x.  I am still trying to fix that.   I have had creative block for about two weeks now and I get very frustrated.  I have about three projects going at once and soon the kids will be off from school and home all day.  No time for me to get my work done. But my block was broken when I decided to create this siggie for this blog. So the good news is I got past my block but I cannot show it.  Oh well,  I will rectify this soon.   Another thing my hair is all cut off. Yep about 5 inches of it. It has been years since I have had short hair. I said yes cause it was getting so thin.  It looks and feels great now. Long hair doesn't always make you look younger. It has to feel good to make you feel younger.  Last week was my youngest sons concert with the band at his school. Now I try not to miss this every year this is so fun to go to.  The music department they have at his school is excellent.  All of the teachers are fantastic. All of the children were wonderful. It was a packed auditorium. We don't care about the heat it is our children up there. *big smiles*    I will describe the closing singing act for the night.  It was the entire 5th grade class and they did a medley of the Beach Boys. He had them do quick costume changes like beach hats and big sunglasses. They just don't sing he makes them act it out. Which is so delightful it leaves a perminant smile on your face. When they got to "In my room" they did another costume change putting on thier robes and hugging stuffed animals. It was a hoot. The best entertainment I have seen all year. Great job kids!  My son plays trumpet and has improved greatly this year.  I wonder if it is just me cause I am the proud mom but no his teacher told me too.  He wants to see him back in band with his trumpet next year. He also wants to tutor him this summer to keep it up. My son was so happy to hear this he begged me "can I please mom?". My son also got accepted into a singing group this summer he tried to get into last summer. My youngest is 10 and loves music. A great place to put his energy. I really feel the singing class this summer will help with some of his shyness.   I also turned on my girlfriend to this bloggy idea and she has since signed up. Her and I call each other sis cause we feel like family. I will post her link.   Warm Smiles

      Again I am rushed for time. I have about 5 minutes before I leave for work.  You know how many times in the last week I have opened this blog planning on writing only to close it. This is my situation. My computer sits in an open room in the front living room.  I wish I had a private room for an office with a door and a lock on it.  The kids buzz around me like little gnats annoying me. Then this holiday weekend family just drops over so no way will I get anything done.  I like to write while I am doing laundry or if I am doing a quick dinner.  I also have kids who have school work.  Their computer doesn't have a printer on it. Mine is crappy anyway.  I will buy a new one soon but they will get my crappy one on their computer.  hahaha LOL  It serves a purpose for their school work.  I have not hooked up the internet for them and I don't think I will for a long time.  I basically control this computer cause I have cable hook up which means instant internet. I keep a close eye on them now. Especially the 12 year old who thinks he is 25.  Ohhh that boy is in for a rude awakening.  hahaha    I am still dreading when they are off for the summer. My computer time that is. I have to do graphics and I need concentration. And some of the nudity I deal with I have to do that at night when they are asleep.  I have my drive partioned and password protected.  I am also starting to store my stuff on line in a place that is private.    Ok now I have to go and I don't want to go to work today. I need a rest from this holiday weekend. *waves like a nut to my friends*   I probably spelled something wrong but I am in a rush.  *shrugs* 'THE STORY OF MY LIFE'

      Today I have one of my days off from work and home alone.  I decided to get serious about me and my future. For all who reads this please understand... that my future always includes my children. But I have to make me healty inside and out.  I know I can do this with my children living with me through it all. I honestly feel that if I am healthy then my children will be.    I tend to make these lists for myself to accomplish some of my goals and maybe one or two things on that list gets done. Currently, some of those things on that list need some real attention and I keep getting scary signs that I cannot ignore anymore. I am not happy with the way I am living my life or my health. The fence that I am on is getting to be a real bitch to balance anymore.  It is a false sense of balance. I do not reccomend this for anyone to live by. But in order for me to change and get off the fence I have to start with one step at a time. It's gonna be slow but I will do it.    First lets tackle my health. I woke up and sat down infront of my computer and I saw this thing I left as a reminder for myself to do. It is a reminder from my health insurance to have a mammogram done. I am 41 and have not had this done yet.  I know how wrong this is but I am scared.  I hear other women say how painful it is and I freeze. The thing that changed my mind today is a coversation I had with one of my customers this weekend.  She is a cancer survivor and her cancer was found early from her mammogram. She told me..."I put mine off too even though I knew cancer was in my family, I wised up just in enough time to have a new life that I am thankful for every day."   Life is definately more important than being scared.   So I made my appointment today for next week. (the earliest appointment I could get) This is one step closer of feeling proud of me today.   The next step.  Why am I blowing off things like this that are so important to my life. I do know the answer to this one.  DEPRESSION! PRESSURE! STRESS! I need to dig deep inside me and pull out what is stopping me from moving forward with my life.   For example not getting my resume done.  Oh I typed one a million times but I destroy them. I see myself on paper and automatically put myself down. 'Whos gonna hire me. Too many holes in my employment.' I have asked for help from some family and friends with my resume but they can only help so much. I am the one who has to do it not them.    I cry alot more than I admit to anyone.  I hide alot of feelings. Only a few people in my life know how I really feel. Only one of them lives close to me. My personal life with relationships is horrible for me right now.  I really cannot talk about it on here.   So the step I made towards this today is I called a psychological center today to find a good therapist. I am waiting for a phone call back to make an appointment.  I need to be fixed. I need help.  I give up!  This is too much for me to handle alone.   Third step. Temporary things help me cope like purging.  I have been cleaning out this house throwing so many things out that should have been thrown out a long time ago. I have a rule if it hasn't been useful, played with, doesn't fit, is broken,or is ugly it goes out the door.  I find we accumulate alot of junk.  I have to give some credit to some of those TV shows that are cleaning out houses.  They have inspired me to clean out and get organized. It feels good to actually find a room that you can enjoy when all the junk has been thrown out. Very cathartic!   So today I would say is a three step proud day for me.

      Well for starters I did go for my mammogram and got my results back.  They didn't find anything. That is a big relief. Now my thoughts on the process well... it really wasn't that bad. The pain was minimal. The place was a newly built specialized women's center and they treated you nicely.  I think they know how tense we are when we get there. They did a lot to make you feel so comfortable. The technician I had was very sweet and professional.  She did comment on the cut I had on my arm from work. Her comment was "how did you get that it looks like it hurts?" Well at my work I do some heavy physical work and use a box cutter. I never get cut with this thing it is usually the boxes that cut me.  It hurts a lot and deep too. Actually this cut was not as bad as the other ones I have had. She told me it is probably because my skin is so fair the cut looks so pink.   Well that is me I am whiter than white bread.  I don't tan anymore.  I either burn or get freckles. I work too much to get to the beach in the summer as often as I would like. I love the shore. I could be on the beach everyday and never get bored. That reminds me I need to buy new kites this year. The boys and I love flying them. So if I buy them then it will force me to make some day trips down the shore. The convenience of having the beach only an hour away is great. One of my goals in life is to have a place to live down there and stay all year round.  Ahh, just to relax and hear the ocean everyday would be great.   My appointment with my new therapist is in about two weeks.  I am really looking forward to it. If I am purging the house I need to purge me too.  I need to get out of my rut and move on with life.   I have pushed myself to do more siggies. I am finding my own way anymore. I start a tutorial and end up doing my own thing anyway. I am also branching out getting other kids of ideas to make for banners and backgrounds. The new stuff I am learning with brush techniques is fascinating me.  I have learned how to make my own custom brushes out of anything. My imagination is endless. I have even been thinking of a new banner to do for a friends website. I am going to use original material too like great nature shots I have from his digital camera. Well, actually he has challenged me to do it.  He has no idea what he started in my brain with this one. LOL I just got some great filters to make stuff look like realistic glass and metal textures. So I am having a party in my head right now. :P  I have been going back and forth between both programs PSP and Photoshop.  PSP has been more versatile for me. I just had to do maintence on a webpage I did earlier this year. I am happy when the client is happy.  The hard part for me is the pricing. I do it as I go along.  I can have flat fees for things but when someone wants maintenance that gets into gray area.  If they want a new face lift for the site then well that is more than maintenance.  The client doesn't know how much goes into it.  It is so hard to explain to them. Also when the client messes with the page too well you have to keep some opinions to yourself.  You have to disconnect from it and let the emotions go from all the work you put into it. OHhh here is the  urlLink web page . I just redid the sound clips and other things.    I have a couple of siggies to do tonight. I also think I will post some of my current work on my personal web space and link it in here. I have to go there and transfer files yadda yadda yadda. Next I will do a blog about my part-time, retail circus lovin, dependable paying, job.  hahaha  Keep it wet people. *big kisses*
