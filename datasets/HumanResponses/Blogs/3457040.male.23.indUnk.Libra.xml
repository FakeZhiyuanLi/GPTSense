      i'm starting to get really tired of my job lately. it's really easy, but just sitting here everyday, thinking... thinking that i have so much more potential and that i could really be applying myself to something a little more worthwhile. there are several things that i've thought about doing, many of those ideas require a somewhat hefty, so i'm not sure what to do because i don't even know if these things will end up working out. i'm always on the look out for a way to make money on my own time and i really think i'll be working for myself in the future anyways but i've been screwed over too many times and now i don't know if the ideas i have now are worth pursuing or if it's just another hair-brained idea.   well, i'm out. i'm going to hang out with the other guys from the band tonight. i'm really looking forward to it. there's been some friction between some of the members lately, and i'm anxious to just chill with em and relax.

      there's been so much going on lately, i don't know where to start. it's weird... i don't really have anything to complain about, but at the same time, it feels like everything is about to fall apart. i've always had big dreams... ambitions if you will. i have never doubted these things until recently. i've always thought that anything could be accomplished with enough hard work, but now i'm realizing how much what i want depends on others as well. i just want to give some people   a loving punch in the face  to wake them up. it's like they don't see how much we're connected, and how much their actions effect me as well.   but i can't  make  them change. so what do i do? i don't really feel like anything i say seeps in. i either feel like giving up, or finding someone else who i can trust before moving on. i just need some wisdom concerning some decisions that i need to make very soon.

      sometimes i get to a place where i see things about other people. it'll be so obvious that they're about to do something totally stupid, or they're really acting immature, or something of that sort. i try and put myself in their shoes, and yet i still don't see any possible way they could still act as dumb as they are.  just makes me think though... if it's so obvious to me, and yet they still do it, how many times have i been about to do something and everyone else just stood there and instead of helping me, just talked about how stupid i was, behind my back.  thinking about that has really opened my eyes. it's really been on my heart that God will give me a new 'realness' with my friends. a burning desire to actually be there for them instead of worrying about what a bad shape they're in, and hope they figure it out. i've always try to avoid confrontations in relationships, and i thought it would make things better, but this week is my wake up call! now i just hope that the actions i take to make ammends won't come across as fake or something. i just hope that it won't seem like i have hidden motives or something like that. i dunno... i'm just tired of feeling weird around my friends and just letting them do whatever. at the same time, i'm thinking about how much i don't like what they're doing.   it's gonna be hard, but i'm working towards a change. i know it will be tough when things come up and i'll want to fall into the same habbits again. at least i know what to do. i just hope it's not too late...

      Well, I  was  working on a site for my projects, but I keep getting DNS errors. It's such a pain! I can't even work on anything site-wise. But oh well. I'm thinking about switching servers. This one has been giving me problems since I started using it. Once I get the site up, I can start with the code. I also have some other web projects that I need to finish as well, so I'm not sure when I'll get some more time to put into gaming. Hopefully this week sometime.

      Ever since I was young, I've always wanted to make games. We owned a Commodore 64 and a TI 99 4/A. My mom found some code in the back of a magazine one time for a simple game so she typed it up on the Commodore and it worked. I remember being fascinated by the fact that games could just be coded that way instead of having to buy new ones at the store. As i grew older, I fell in love with text based adventure games. So much in fact, that I tried several times to make one myself and started reading books on how to program in Basic on the TI. I found books at the library that had lots of different games to program, and how to make your own games as well.   The desire to make games came in spurts. I would forget about it for a year or two, then I'd see a book on the subject of game programming and I would hit it real hard for a while until I lost interest again.   About four years ago, I really started getting into music and I joined up with some of my best friends and started a band. Once we started playing shows, it was obvious how important it would be to get a website so that we could post up info about shows, pictures, music, etc... I started using HTML, and did some decent pages I guess but they all just seemed to be lacking a lot.   Then... one day... it happened... I was introduced to Macromedia Flash! I was so amazed at what could be done! And how easy it was! I started using it for sites and other miscellaneous things and when I was looking at a website for some good tutorials, I learned that people were already using actionscript to makes games! WOW! The flame was sparked again and here I am!
