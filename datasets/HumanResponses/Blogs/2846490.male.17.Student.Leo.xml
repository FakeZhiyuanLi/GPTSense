       Celibacy &amp; The City     About Me:  I am a mixed race Kuwaiti residing in Kuwait. I didn’t find any online columns directed at gay teenage men that I could relate to, so I decided to write my own. You probably will roll your eyes quite a bit while reading my columns, please note that I’m not as narcissistic as I sound, well I hope not. I may not be People magazine’s sexiest man alive but I am pretty damn desirable. If you don’t like my column shut your mouth and just close the god-forsaken window. This is my way of sharing my ‘experience’.   Ok, first of all, I have come up with a list of the kind of men that you should probably avoid. .    1.Do not date men that dress perfectly but have bad nails, especially toenails   This tells you that the guy doesn’t dress up because he wants to do it, he does it to prove something to other people, and in other words he’s a shallow twat. Since people usually don’t notice his nails (especially toenails) he doesn’t take the 5 minutes necessary to groom himself. A man that doesn’t pay attention to details is just……undatable. We ALL deserve better. Well, most of us do.    2. If you’re not looking for sex and your partner begins to say sexual things and immediately say he’s joking, dump him ASAP.   This is a method used by guys that want to get in your pants but aren’t man enough to make a pass. A man that wants to hit on you without  consequences. In other words, a gutless loser. If you ignore this it will just happen more often until you inevitably dump him (unless you are pathetic and lack self-respect). So don’t waste your time, dump the wanker as soon as possible. Don’t get me wrong, a perverted joke every once in a while is funny but if it becomes a habit it’s just a bore.    3.Do not date anyone that doesn’t care about their appearance at all   Must I explain? This signifies laziness. Using common sense, a man that is too lazy to get himself to look presentable sure as hell can’t get with me (or with anyone with dignity).    4.Do not date anyone without self-respect   If they don’t respect themselves how are you supposed to respect them? They’re usually self-loathing and a complete bore. NEXT.    5.Do not date anyone insecure with their masculinity   Trust me, these are absolutely the worst kinds of men. They are really insecure about their masculinity and so they overcompensate. Its sad really, or hilarious, depending on your sense of humor. It is really annoying though.    6.Do not date cocky overconfident pricks   It’s amusing at first, but it gets really old – fast.   The are the qualities that your date should have are:    1.Men with nice smiles   I know this is a total cliché but you can’t go wrong with a nice smile. He can’t be all that bad.

      Flamboyance - I have a theory about it. I think lots of homosexual guys act flamboyant not simply for attention in general, but attention of other gay guys. Its just kinda like advertising your homosexuality. I guess it makes it easier to find a boyfriend or something.&nbsp; You know what, more power to them for just being all out there.   Flamboyance is a drug I use to give my life meaning - The Pet Shop Boys

      Why are anti-jews called anti semitic ? That makes absoltutely no sense because Arabs are also Semitic people, simply calling anti-jews anti Semitic really makes no sense

      Oh my goodness I miss the shopping in Kuwait so much! There isn't a single mall in Pullman, and the closest half decent mall is in Spokane, which is like an hour and a half away. I've been doing a lot of internet shopping, but that isnt half as fun. GOSH this sounds so depressing, but I haven't even been able to find decent men's cologne.

      Urinals are disgusting. And uncivilised. Holding your penis in your hand and urinating next to other men is just horrible. Personally, I twinkle while sitting.

      Today a person from the fraud divison of the bank called me about all the charges on my debit card. She thought it was stolen or something, because students usually don't spend 1500 dollars in 2 weeks. I was like, yeah, I kinda went crazy this week and you're only young once! She laughed until she wet herself. Bitch.

      Children. Why do people have them ? I think i have the answer to that. I think the main reason people have children is because its good for there egos. It justifies their existence. They need someone to rely on them, they need to feel that they have a larger pupose in life that watching television in a thong on saturday mornings. Personally, I could never have a child. I know I'm gay and so its physically impossible to have one with a man but I still don't think I would want one if I was straight. They'd get in the way of my fabulousness. Sure, they're cute and novel.....for two weeks and then I'd probably lose interest. I can't take care of plants let alone children. People think that my self obsession is just an act. Well sweety, I'm here to tell you that it ain't. I mean its only natural to be.......preoccupied with yourself. Its just that I am......to more of an extreme. So children.............no way, ew.
