      Well the mall was really boring today. I didnt buy anything but i ended up putting on a three hundred dollar pair of sunglasses.... wowza! But while i was away i couldnt stop thinking about my angel! i love tara sooo much. I had a talk with staci today online, and it made me realize some things. She said that tara and i would never make it in the end, that we were stupid and that we wouldnt be faithful to each other. Well... thinking over this now i realized some things. I know for a fact beyond all doubt that i love tara. I know i wont leave her or ever cheat on her, and i trust the same from her. What staci's problem is is that she is jealous of tara. I really think that. She is jealous of everything about tara. Tara has everything a girl would want. She has an amazing personality, better than any other person ive met before, she is a perfect angel, which staci falls short of, and she has the greatest body ive ever seen on anybody! Staci is jealous and she has reason to be... cause tara is the greatest girl that has ever been born here on earth! God sent her and in her there is pure perfection. I look at her and know that god is there for me and always will be.... through her. I know tara will  always  be there for me. And i think deep down staci has a problem with tara cause she is everything staci wants to be. I used to look at staci in mild amusement but now i see someone desperate for attention. I love tara, and ive fallen for her, the perfect angel. I dont know where I'd be without her, and i pray i will never have to. I love ya angel, and i will always be here for you.

IM IN LOVE WITH TARA!!! ive never felt like this before, and i am the happiest ive ever been in my life. With tara, heaven is on earth in my life. I get a doorway  to heaven through her, and ive never seen such beauty in all my life. My plans for my party are underway, and the chance of seeing tara is sooooooo exciting that my hands are trembling. I am worried about her grandfather, and i pray that everything turns out all right. I figure im hers forever and shes mine forever, so thats why my blog is named the way it is ;) i love you sooooo much tara, and i will never leave you. I know you loved ross once, and i hope that one day you will learn to love me more than youve ever dreamed of. Tara.... you are just sooo..... wow. Thats my new word for you now.

      Ive never felt like this before. Tara and I are having the times of our lives, and as each day passes I love her more and more. We have our fun ;) and we feel comfortable about it... yet, as long as shes mine, ive got all that i need. Shes soooo perfect, and I know that my  heart is for her only. My body is hers and so is my heart and soul. She hasnt taken nething from me, its that my heart has chosen her. She is my soulmate. Ive never felt like this before!!  This feeling..... this soulmate connection makes me remember a song ive sang for her before.  My gift is my song, and this ones for you and you can tell everybody that this is your song it may be quite simple, but now that its done i hope you dont mind, i hope you dont mind, that i put down in words, how wonderful life is, now you're in the world...  Sat on the rooftop, and i kicked off the moss, some of these verses well they... they got me quite cross. but the sun has been kind while i wrote this song its for the people like you that keep it turned on so excuse my forgettin... but these things that i do, you see, ive forgotten whether they're green or if they're blue! Anyway the thing is, what i really mean, you're eyes are the sweetest stars, I've ever seen!  And you can tell everybody, this is your song it may be quie simple, but now that its done, I hope you dont mind, i hope you dont mind, that i put down in words, how wonderful life is.... now you're in the world  Tara, this song describes what i feel so well. Everything is meaningless now without you. You are all that matters to me. When i look in your eyes, i see something there ive never seen before. I love you more than life itself, and I want you to know that you are my one and only true love. I love you tara.... i always will. I am yours, and I always will be. Thank you for making my life complete.  I love you angel
