       Various species on the face of the earth are evolving since crores of years. Due to this evolution, they are able to survive. Those who couldn't adapt themselves according the changing nature, they are lost.  There is another species on the face of the earth, unique although it doesn't have a long history of existence. The uniqueness of this species is that it is MAN MADE, it is CAR. As compared to other species, its been very short when cars hit our lives, but they've gone under enormous evolution to survive. Natural evolution is slow, but here the evolution is controlled by the brains of the men. Fast extremely fast. Cars are evolving since ever they first came into existence. Now there are cars available for any kind of geographical situation present on our earth. Cars can run on ice, desert, even water, they can fly and unbelievably they can run faster than the speed of sound, SONIC BOOM. Cars adopt themselves for any kind of terrain. Fuel doesn't matter, petrol, diesel, gas, NO2 , electricity, fuel cell etc etc. Racing cars, city cars, multipurpose cars, saloons, limousines, mountain cars, desert cars, hybrid cars, concept cars. We just cant even imagine their various form available. What we see is mere a percentage of all the various types of cars.  4 wheel drive, 2 wheel drive, disk brakes, electronic ignition, microprocessor controlled, turbo engine, steel radial, fog lamps, defroster, sunroof, air bag, McPherson suspension, independent suspension, collapsible handle, child lock, power windows, traction control, anti-braking system, side bars, tachometer, trip meter, climate control, disc brakes...... keep counting, there are so many terms coined by this man made species. Tremendous technical details associated with it. Above all there are Formula One cars ......... no match for them. Its a car cum air-craft.  In the beginning, there were cars made out of horse cab. Just an engine fitted to it and the driver still sitting at the back, higher than the passenger. They evolved slowly with front driver's seat, then a cabin, then came the revolution.... internal combustion engine. No other machine has adopted internal combustion engine so much for its evolution. Car then became a status symbol. Now different countries had different evolution story of cars. America had big roads so long and big cars came into market. Further wide roads were made for the big cars. Powerful cars for long and straight roads. But Europe have a long history of roads. There roads are small, so small cars were made. Cars with high fuel efficiency. America had Cadillac so Europe had Fiat.  Keep on classifying..... the list just wouldn't end. Later cars got a sportsmen touch, so an altogether different category of cars evolved... called racing cars. So cars were just not for travel or status symbol, it became an entertainment. Entertainment earns good money, so did the car.  Now a cars is not a dream. Its very easy to acquire a car of your choice fitting your needs. But still there are dream cars. Mercedes rolled out May Bach...... 5 crore man made ultimate machine. Few can have this car but many can dream about it.  In a very short span, cars have evolved to an ultimate machine, dream of men made by men. They are still evolving........ to some... super machine with unbelievable performance, unbelievable efficiency. It all human, that's keeping and accelerating the pace of its evolution. Next time you look at your car, don't consider it just a machine, it's a species that's still evolving, still surviving......

       Happiness is something final and complete in itself, as being the aim and end of all practical activities whatever .... Happiness then we define as the active exercise of the mind in conformity with perfect goodness or virtue.   - Aristotle
