      Hooray for having no school on a Monday. Oh wait, its cause its a national holiday here in Canadia. Like I'd even complain. Only problem is I have my final math exam tomorrow. I'm so dead. But besides the negative... I figured out how to fix the template and therefore added some Other Blogs to my blog. Word.  Johnny's in the basement Mixing up the medicine I'm on the pavement Thinking about the government The man in the trench coat Badge out, laid off Says he's got a bad cough Wants to get it paid off Look out kid It's somethin' you did God knows when But you're doin' it again You better duck down the alley way Lookin' for a new friend The man in the coon-skip cap In the big pen Wants eleven dollar bills You only got ten.

      For my first post ever, I'd just like to say where I stand.  Through steel walls Your voice blastin' on True rebel my brother Mumia I reflect upon You be tha spark That set tha prairie fires on Make tha masses a mastodon path To trample tha fascists on At fifteen exposed Philly's finest killing machine With boots and mad guns They tried to pacify you young Cause and effect Smell tha smoke and tha breeze My panther my brother We are at war until you're free  You'll never silence tha voice of tha voiceless

      You know who's an awesome frontman? Yes. That guy. But you know who else? James Hetfield of Metallica. The guy has it all. He's a hardass, with a killer voice for metal vocals, and he plays some badass rhythm guitar. He's written some of the best songs the music industry has ever heard, and some they haven't. He's written some masterpieces, and the guy battled alcoholism. I mean, yeah I loved his writing more when he was a drunk, starting fights with his own drummer. But you gotta love the fact that the man took his life in his own hands and fought back at his challenges, and overcame them. So, thanks Mr. Hetfield, for kicking so much god damn ass. Just come back to Montreal dammit.

      What an update. I'm now totally done with this evil piece of junk they call highschool. Huzzah!  Anyways, went to La Ronde this weekend. Awesome time. Got soaked to the bone on this one ride. And it made my shorts see-through, so everyone got to see my sexy ass boxers. It so turned Kathy, Diana, Christine and Matt on (That's right, even Matt).  So yeah, I've got the Darkness in 7 days, which will so kick ass. And then QAA prom. Fun times a brewin for the summer.

       urlLink      urlLink Which Family Guy character are you?   I dunno if I should be thrilled for getting a funny character, or ashamed because he's also a sex freak.  Anyways, I'm FINALLY done ALL my exams. Thank the good lord Eddie Van Halen. (This seems familiar, but Christine pointed out I still had a 9 hour english exam that was a total joke).  Can't wait to go spend some time at La Ronde this summer. Hooray!

        Animal crackers In my soup Monkeys and rabbits Loop-da-Loop  Now seriously, Animal Crackers are a fountain of youth. Don't you remember when you'd be all happy when you'd open your pasty green lunch bag and see a nice bag of animal crackers waiting for you? How did that make you feel? Happy? Exactly. Animal Crackers are awesome.  And thank the good lord Eddie Van Halen, I'm finally done my exams.

      Sorry for the long ass delay... but Van Halen is back and better than ever!!!  Yeah! I saw them in Toronto on July 3rd and all I can say is wow. Well, quick breakdown. I started every "Eddie!" chant, with this other dude next to me. We must have started 8 of them! The show was fucking insane though! Sammy signed a ton of stuff, including two bras, which were given to him by two lucky girls. Eddie's son Wolfgang did not play this time during Eddie's solo. When Ed brought out the powerdrill for Poundcake, I almost crapped myself. I also got Mike's attention and he gave me a little thumbs up. Mikey's bass was the loudest fucking thing I ever heard. During his bass solo, I could feel my eyebrows move. Alex Van Halen is a machine. The man doesn't stop, and his drum solo was insane. He played for no lie, at least 15 minutes non-stop.  Finally, we get to Eddie. The man is ripped like Bruce Lee. And can the guy move. He didn't stop moving, running, jumping, falling over the entire night. He even did the 5150 walk! The man is God.  The set list included (this is pretty-much the order) Jump Runaround It's About Time Up For Breakfast Humans Being Mike's Solo Somebody Get Me A Doctor Alex's Solo Poundcake When It's Love Unchained Sammy's Solo (Where Eagles Fly/Learning to See) Eddie's Solo Top Of The World The Seventh Seal Why Can't This Be Love Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love Right Now  And For The Encore: You Really Got Me Dreams Panama  Oh, and they did a little rundown of the show on MuchMoreMusic with some footage of Jump. And I was in the footage. Booyah Grandpa!
