      Well, I have this craving that I cannot fill.  It's called Gmail.  It's Google's new email service that they will be using in the near future.  Right now they are offering it to oh so lucky, blessed, chosen ones in a Beta version.  I read that they even offer the random user of Blogger and opportunity to join the elite.  Alas, I am not one of those.  I will be checking every day to see if I should be looked kindly upon by the gods of Google.  Oh well, this soldier/net tech-head will have to wait and see.  There's always tomorrow.  --Aaron Kyle Swancey

      I can't believe my lil' baby Charlotte is graduating high school.  Watching her grow up, protecting her, and guiding her with advice to become the great young woman she is now has been exciting.  She's so wise in the fact that she actually listens to my advice and doesn't decide to find out things the hard way.  I only hope that I gave her the best advice to help build and stabilize her life.  I love that girl more than anything else in the world.  Anyways, I could go on for days, but I won't. On to the market. So, let me begin by saying that I am kicking myself for not following through on some of my basic trading rules.  I miss out on a sweetheart buy that passed the triple threat test that I have. I'll explain the triple threat aka the green light.  I follow numerous stocks that I believe have either great long term or short term potential.  I try to only find stocks that have both, as Warren Buffett said "I never buy a stock that I don't plan to keep."  That said, I still find myself looking at a couple short term plays.  The triple threat applies to a short term play.  I give a stock three criteria for a must buy.  I often buy stocks that only meet two of the criteria and never pass on a triple.  Until two days ago.  The three criteria are: 1)  A stock that is over-sold.  This means that a stock's price has been dropping from a strong surge of sellers out-pacing the number of buyers and the price drops.  By analyzing data and watching a stock over a period of time, you can make an educated guess whether a stock is over-sold. 2)  A stock that is in a mush sector that is heating up.  The sector doesn't have to be mush, the sector can just be heating up and expected to continue to rise.  Gaining momentum from a recent decline in the sector only makes the stock that more attractive. 3)  Quarterly Earning Report is due soon.  Do not assume that any reports are a good sign, keep in mind that I am tracking potential and attractive stocks.  Stocks that I believe will most certainly beat estimates on the earning reports.  So this is only a criteria due to the fact that positive data about earnings will soon be released.  Usually a combo of criteria 1 and 3 will trigger a strong consideration of buying action.  Other combos are dependent on more research.  An 1,2,3 is an automatic. Having said all of this, let's find out why I didn't buy on a 1,2,3. The truth is I am a cautious Bull.  The market looks weak right now.  This was my reason of not buying the 1,2,3.  I went against my own rules, which has made me realize that I am not at the level of trading I thought I was.  You cannot break your own rules.  This is capital in trading. I won't delay this any longer.  Here's the stock and what has happened. Charming Shoppes ticker CHRS Charming Shoppes is the owner of clothing stores for plus sized women's apparel, best known probably being Lane Bryant.  This stock first attracted me because I have an obession with how America is getting so unhealthy and out of shape.  I have a less that endearing term for this phenomenom that I won't share because I don't want to offend anyone.  I decided to look for clothing stores that would profit off this terrible trend. i found Charming Shoppes and researched and watched the stock for 2 months.  Earning Reports were due May 19th.  I also researched that the retail sector was due to grow due to job growth.  I watched and watched.  The stock started dropping way too much, especially with earnings coming up.  The sector also hadn't given any signs of the nice rise.  Then earnings started coming in from other retail stores, the majority positive.  The stock continued to slump.  I told myself "At first momentum of the stock beginning to rise, I'm buying, or May 18th the day before earnings, which ever comes first."  The market struggled the week before the 18th.  This scared me away from my triple.  So May 19th, Charming Shoppes was estimated earning of 0.12 cents diluted per share.  The actual report should Charming brought in profits of 0.22 cents.  Do the math, it beat earnings estimate by about 80%.  I watched the stock jump 15% that day.  It's pushing up a little more today.  So, by going against my rules I missed a 17-20% profit on my money in two days. Lesson was definitely learned. Never, ever take my techniques to the bank.  Decide on your own how you wish to invest and trade. That's it for the day.  Love you Charlotte and so proud of you!!!  --Aaron Kyle Swancey

      As promised, I'm going to post about one of my passions, interests, and potential job fields.  This post is dedicated to today's market and the market in general.  Yes, I know you cannot major in the stock market but it is a division of the economy directly tied to major businesses which drive the economy.  Even though the overall state of the market is shaky as of recently, I have to give myself a pat on the back in my short-term investing.  One company I decided to invest in a few weeks ago was Armor Holdings.  Why I didn't get in it before is the question I keep asking myself.  Don't you hate it when you miss the obvious?  A quick rundown on Armor Holding follows.  One of the smaller companies that Armor Holdings bought a couple years ago happens to be the main producer of Armored Humvees for the military.  Wow, that's too obvious isn't it?  The stock has tripled itself in the last year.  Oh well, knowing how badly we still need Armored Humvees, I wisely bought stock in AH.  It's just reported very strong 1st quarter earning last week and has grown significantly since last quarter and the year's before.  I am doing well in the stock and that's with the very shaky market.  If only we had all bought some defense stocks January 2003. I want to talk about the market now.  What a poor market where good news is bad news.  What I mean is that in March jobs grew tremendously, better than they had in over 4 years!  This great news lead to the Fed looking at raising historically low interest rates.  That fueled concern and caused the market to struggle and drop.  Then in April, BOOM, another great job report!  The best back to back months in 5 years!  The whisper on the street from experts in that the Fed will move sooner in raising rates, like in June, than around August as proposed.  Add in some of the greatest earning reports turned in from companies since before the tech bubble burst, and the result is almost assurance of companies hiring even more in the following months.  Once again, fear is driving the market down, but will rates really hurt us?  Not likely.  In my opinion the sooner the first rates hike comes the better.  Why?  I believe speculation and fear of the hikes is doing more to drive the market down than a quick hike would do.  Let's raise rates by 25-50 basis points and let the market adjust. The Economy, the Market, Google, and the Election The economy is the number one issue on most Americans minds when election time comes.  How the market performs in the next six months will have an effect on the outcome of the election in November.  You can bet that all eyes in both parties will be on Google the next 6 months.  Google?  Why Google?  For those who don't know, Google is going public.  They will be having a Dutch Auction IPO and begin offering a piece of their company to the public generating 2.6 billion dollars in the auction.  IPO's traditionally do not live up to the hype.  They usually take years before they regain their footing and start their rise, if they ever do rise.  This is no normal company though.  This is the world's most popular search engine who also powers the very page you are looking at now.  I won't play advisor and tell you if you should buy or not; it's your money.  I will explain how Google can alter the outcome on the Presidential Election.  If, any many believe they will, Google races out of the gates, then expect the market to grab hold of it's coattails and join the ride.  Driving the market and the economy up...yep, you guessed it, Google could actually lock Bush's Re-election bid.  Interesting isn't it?  It will be interesting to watch too.  If you are thinking about buying stock in Google, I recommend doing plenty of research and consulting a broker.  I, myself, am very excited about Google's future after reading about what all they have planned, but timing is everything with IPO's.  Expect a war between Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft. Well, if you aren't asleep then you are still reading this. Peace!  --Aaron Kyle Swancey

      Today is Day 382 of my deployment, not that I'm counting.  I'm at least grateful that it is no where near as hot as it was last year around this time.  Last year I was already battling 125-140 degree temps.  So far I think the hottest is has been this week is 105.  There are actually still clouds around too.  Last year I didn't see a cloud until September 2003.  What I hate the most is the extension.  Not in a sense that we will be out here longer, but that we will be leaving in the middle of the Iraqi summer.  That convoy is going to be like driving through Hell.  Who in there right mind drives big metal trucks with no A/C, in full battle gear and kevlar helmet, drinking boiling hot water, with heat melting your legs from the engine compartment, in the middle of or late July, in 140-150 degree heat, for 2-3 days straight???  Oh yeah, we do!  I know your saying 140-150???  Yes, that's right.  I've seen many thermometers bust out here in August until we found one that read up to 150.  In the sun it will make it all the way to 150.  So yeah, I'm really looking forward to that *note sarcasm*.  Anyways, what else is new???  Met an unfortunate girl who has never seen Top Gun before.  I thought that was news in itself.  I'm determined that she doesn't continue to be deprived and will fix this ASAP, poor kid.  Well, I need to go and do a few  things.  I'll be back I hope to post something more meaningful than this babble post.  Peace --Aaron Kyle Swancey

      I believe a underlying problem in America is we are caught in a patriotic mix of emotions.  We are carefully balancing on a "double-edged sword" of sorts.  This balance can be easily thrown off and for many it has been.  I also believe it's not only the pride of patriotism that's underlying but also the lack thereof.  We are caught in both ends of the spectrum with, sadly, only a few I believe that can reason this balance.  Below are two quotes I'd like to share.  Hopefully we can begin to educate ourselves before making our decisions and allow reason to mix with our emotions.  "WAR IS AN UGLY THING, BUT NOT THE UGLIEST OF THINGS; THE DECAYED AND DEGRADED STATE OF MORAL AND PATRIOTIC FEELING WHICH THINKS THAT NOTHING IS WORTH WAR IS MUCH WORSE. A MAN WHO HAS NOTHING FOR WHICH HE IS WILLING TO FIGHT; NOTHING HE CARES ABOUT MORE THAN HIS OWN PERSONAL SAFETY; IS A MISERABLE CREATURE WHO HAS NO CHANCE OF BEING FREE, UNLESS MADE AND KEPT SO BY THE EXERTIONS OF BETTER MEN THAN HIMSELF." --John Stewart Mills  "Beware the leader who bangs the drums of war in order to whip the citizenry into a patriotic fervor, for patriotism is indeed a double-edged sword. It both emboldens the blood, just as it narrows the mind... And when the drums of war have reached a fever pitch and the blood boils with hate and the mind has closed, the leader will have no need in seizing the rights of the citizenry. Rather, the citizenry, infused with fear and blinded with patriotism, will offer up all of their rights unto the leader, and gladly so. How do I know? For this is what I have done. And I am Caesar." --Anonymous of course this wasn't written by Caesar, it's a hoax that found the internet after 9/11 and passed to fuel the political situation around our President, but I still find it as an interesting opposite to the real quote above by John Stewart Mills.  We can fight, sustain, and win long wars abroad and at home with domestic issues.  When 9/11 occurred we all were united and awakened.  It's sad to watch us divide and close our eyes. --Aaron Kyle Swancey

      I figure it's only fair to let those who stumble across this blog to know a little about me.  I am 24 yrs old, in the US Army currently serving in Iraq since April 2003.  I would have to say that I am a moderate Republican.  I like to take on too much at once, but have learned to control and concentrate my energy so that I can finish some of the many tasks and goals I take on.  The things or job fields that interest me the most are computers, nanotechnology, government, economics and investing, and politics.  I'm currently tearing myself into pieces deciding which of these fields do I want to pursue and major in college.  I am planning on getting out of the military this year and heading to college.  These fields interest me for three major reasons.  1:  I want to change the world for the better.  2.  I love economics, the stock market, and investing.  3.  I love computer technology.  Nanotechnology seems great except for the amount of college it involves.  I'd love to get in it, but probably won't due to the 6-8 years of college that will ensue.  Computers would be the logical choice since I am very proficient in this field to begin with, but lately I have had yearning for something else.  Government and politics have been steadfast in my mind for a number of years, but only now do I realize or believe I can succeed here.  Even if I don't, I feel I need to try because there is so much I want to change in our government.  Economics is a passion for me.  I love to study the market and businesses.  I could do it all day given the time.  My newest area of study in the market is stock options, how to read a company, and gauging when to buy options.  Of course I'm not using actual money when learning, but I follow and track stocks as if I had.  It's fun to learn and requires tedious work, but who wouldn't want to work like that when it will make you money.  Which way will I decide?  What will shape my choices?  Where will I go next?  I honestly don't know, but I am confident in my abilities to succeed and excited about the future.  That's the current state I am in right now.  Most of my posts probably will end up touching one of these subjects along with current events in the world.  It will be interesting to watch where I go from here and I'm sure I will look back at this time period and realize that this is one of my major crossroads in my life.  "A thousand mile journey begins with a single step." and my next journey is about to begin.

      So, it's been awhile since I read this book, but I wanted to post about it since it still jumps in my mind often.  Let me begin with saying that I loved the book.  It was a one of a kind read.  I mean, no one writes this well about controversial or thought provoking subjects in mainstream anymore, especially to tie it into a great fictional story.  Bravo to Dan Brown for giving a small treat to us readers.  Now to the other part of the Divinci Code...what the book says.  This book is bound to shake, or should ask questions, even those with the strongest faith in Christianity especially the Catholic Church.  I've read of such things before as being I'm a very open-minded, ever hungry, research craving individual.  The book is themed about Gnostic views of the early church and Christ.  It's important to remember that these views are not brand new and have been around for the last half century.  It is important to remember that they have never hit mainstream media like this before.  The book really speaks for itself and is well worth the read for everyone.  What you will get out of it is a great fictional masterpiece.  What else you get out of it is up to you.  Pick it up, read it, enjoy it, and decide for yourself.  I would love to hear from anyone else who has read it.

      Okay, yesterday I watched the video of the beheading of Nick Berg.  Since then it's been constantly on my mind, as if I don't have enough on it already.  It has totally pissed me off, and stirred some confused feelings about our ordeal in Iraq.  If you want to watch the video, let me know and I'll give you the URL I found it at.  To say the least, that video was gruesome.  At the same time, I believe it should be seen by all the world.  The only reason I can think of to not let it go public would be the respects of his family.  Other than that, I think it would serve as a rude awakening to the world of how grave and serious the present situation in Iraq is.  It might also ignite some sentiment and fire into our less than interested fellow Americans.  To watch this barbaric act serves to bring home some of the problems here.  I read somewhere today some interesting questions that I feel deserve to be re-asked here and anywhere they can find light or a ear.  The man was asking and questioning not so much the war in Iraq, but the will and foresight of the American people.  The war is not the question in my mind.  The questions about the war that are being asked now should have been asked before.  War isn't something to jump into with questions, unless you are willing to push them aside in the best interest of the nation and keep them aside even when things go bad.  The opinion and questions were given by Mark Shields.  I won't quote it all but will what I find most important.  He introduces the article with visiting Walter Reed Hospital and stories of soldiers suffering, losing limbs, but maintaining pride in their service and country.  Then remarks on how the prison abuse scandals have wrongly and unfairly clouded their heroic efforts with suspicion.  This is where I felt the words hit me though: "If, as the conservative author Michael Barone has written, "War demands equality of sacrifice," how can the United States go to war when all the sacrifice and suffering are borne exclusively by the men and women in the nation's military and their loved ones, and nothing at all is asked of the most prosperous and most privileged among us?  Do we believe that an army does not fight a war and that, instead, a country fights a war? And that unless the country's leaders openly asked for -- and the country's citizens willing agreed to -- sacrifice, that no war ever ought to be begun? When the nation decides to send troops into combat, then national defense truly becomes everyone's business and everyone's responsibility. Do we agree with the congressional testimony of Gen. John Vessey Jr., former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who acknowledged that the all-volunteer American military was created as a peacetime service: "In time of war, we know we will need compulsory military service (draft)"?  Is President Bush's message to the nation's most advantaged that others will serve and, 'You will pay no price, you will bear no burden'?"  While the overall tone of the article is a prop for Senator Kerry, as noted with the closing of the article, I found these questions to be questions we should all ask ourselves.  The question that hangs in the air of Americans now is "Should we have gone to war in Iraq?"  Unfortunately, this is a question that should have been answered before.  It was asked, but given the tremendous change in the answer it obviously wasn't full-heartedly answered.  This leads to what needs to be asked now.  Do we as Americans, understand our choices and do we choose wisely with much thought in our actions?  If so, are we willing to stay the course and stand by our convictions in what we said is right?  Are we willing to sacrifice ourselves too, or have we become complacent in relying on others, our Armed Forces, to sacrifice for us?  Why are we so quick to leave those who sacrifice for us hanging out to dry and left to go it alone when things get tough?  Have we become blind with patriotism or lack thereof?  America doesn't only need to re-evaluate the situation in Iraq.  We also need to re-evaluate our decision-making and our will.  We are greatest power the world has seen since ancient Rome.  It's time we had better start acting like it or we will phase out as quickly as all other great nations that have dominated a small period of time. --Aaron Kyle Swancey
