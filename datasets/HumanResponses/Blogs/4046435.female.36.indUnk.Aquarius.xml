      I've been sleep deprived for over a year now. Sleep used to be almost a hobby for me - I loved it! I should be in bed now as everyone else is sleeping, but that means I have some time to myself. Sean woke up one time last night, but hopefully  tonight he'll go back to sleeping through the night. Emma still sleeps in our room. Both babies slept with us for their first seven months, but my sleep was so poor that two days before their seven month birthday I had had it and announced that they were moving to their cribs that night. They both cried, but seemed to make a pretty easy transition. When Emma started teething though she started waking up a lot more and we moved her back with us and that's how it has been since.  Back when they were both sleeping with us I had come to dread nights. All four of us were in a queen size bed and I had a baby on each side of me, with a bed rail to keep the babies from falling out. I would roll from one side to the other nursing Emma and Sean, sometimes as often as every twenty minutes - it was absolutely exhausting. It was a good night if I had a two hour stretch of sleep. It is much better now, but I still crave a full night of sleep. I am trying to transition Emma to the Pack-and-Play to get her a little more seperated from me. She likes to nurse on and off throughout the night and is very vocal when she wakes up. She used to sleep really well with us, but now sometimes cries or wakes up and wants to play in the middle of the night, so I feel it's a good time to transition her as she isn't sleeping that well anyway.

      So I talked with Rob last night and we both think it is fine to use our names in the blog. Since I'm not writing in their journals this way I can at least keep some type of diary for Emma and Sean.&nbsp; I wish I had started this when they were born, but better now than never. I may try to backtrack some before sleep deprivation deletes all my early memories of babies - so much has happened in the last 13 months!  The big news of the last week is that Sean is now weaned and sleeping through the night! He last nummied (nursed) on 7/23 - his 13th month birthday. I had thought he would probably still nurse at bedtime for another month or two, but he seems to be doing fine. I went to the Indigo Girls Saturday night and so he didn't nurse before bedtime and Rob reported he did fine. So Rob has been putting him to bed the last few nights with no problems and tonight I put him to bed and he didn't seem to miss nursing. Sunday night I cried&nbsp; about this - my little boy is growing up and doesn't need me in the same way he used to. I thought it would be a relief to not be nursing at least one of them, but the bedtime nursing was always very sweet and loving. He did sit and let me read to him tonight, but not quite the same.  Well Emma isn't weaned yet and she's crying so I guess it's time to go...

      Last night my husband asked me what I was going to be writing about. Good question, isn't it? I still have the idea that I want to write a book about twins, but I'm not sure what kind of book I want it to be.&nbsp; You're supposed to write what you know about, but I'm certainly no expert on twins, I'm just learning as they grow.  Babies are in their high chairs right now watching Baby Einstein. Sometimes I feel badly about doing that, but it's often the only way I can get a break. I really need to get into the shower as Terminex will be coming soon - that's a whole other story.  I'm still trying to figure out why people do blogs and why I'm doing one. Is it to share info with others, or just a good way to organize their own thoughts. Maybe both. I'm torn between wanting to be anonymous and finding it just plain easier to write using our real names. I'll have to discuss that with my husband tonight. I doubt anyone will just start reading this on their own, so I guess it doesn't matter if I use our names but don't tell anyone about it. Or, I could tell family and friends and they could check in and read and look at photos if they wanted. What to do???

      So I barely know what a blog is and here I am starting my own.&nbsp; My babies are 13 months old and I love being a stay at home mom, but I feel that my brain has atrophied. For all of you other moms out there, you already know about "mommy-brain". I'm hoping it is a temporary thing and that blogging may help kickstart my brain. I have a vague idea of writing&nbsp;a book about twins someday and hope this might be a start.   Does anyone really read these things???   I bought journals for the babies just before or right after they were born (see what I said about mommy-brain!). I thought it would be great to record my thoughts and feelings, baby firsts and other great stories. I have written in each book exactly 2 times.   I worry that I will die, and if I haven't written about it, my babies won't know how very much I love and cherish them.&nbsp; I haven't even started their baby books yet - matter of fact I haven't even bought them! Mother guilt starts so early.   My husband just came in with my small girl child who was crying - I asked for a few more minutes to write. I really do sometimes call my babies "my girl child" and "my boy child." Do I want to use their real names here?   Until I had the babies I never realized how precious time is. Free time is a very rare commodity when you have twins. "The days and hours may go slow, but the months fly by." This was told to us by experienced parents. I'd give up my free time to hold my newborns again. Is this why people keep having babies?
