       hey all im just doing this cause im really bored... yeah and i might use this when im in washington... about that.. ooh im gonna miss soo many ppl! (one in particular*) but at least ill be with my dear cousins who i havent seen in almost a year! neway my birthday is on sunday and i guess im just gonna have a few friends over before i go away...sooo my weekend from there on is gonna be busy. i went to the rec yesterday and got a really bad sunburn and it hurts! ouchy! i saw lani tay and zch there so i hung out with them for a while until they had to go. asked ginnie if she wanted to come over so she slpet over and we had to get up at 6am today so my mom could give her a ride home but i kinda went home with her so we went to the park and played with some little kids until noon and THEN we decided to walk to target and buy the perfect score! its actually a pretty funny movie, ne way as we were walking i suggested that we pick up anne and bring her on our trek so we did that and then there were 3 of us walking around slp, but ne way we bought the movie and some flipflops and went to BK then back home to get some water becase it was hotter than hell out, my sunburn got even worser! then watched the moive wed been waiting to watch all day. hehe. funfunfunfun... i cant wait for the rest of my summer in washington, ahh but then i dont want to leave my dear friends... i know i already said this but life is full of tough choices and u gotta pick the opprotunity that comes around less often.. umm dont listen to my advice cause its usally not that great... heh well i better go .... TOMBER LA CHEMISE! BAker- omg my mom separated mayo and vinegrete!!!!! Ginnie- OMG we need to watch the perfect score again! Ben- i love you! and i hope u get ur fucked up compputer working again Cate-Have fun in Duluth on ur super uber cool boat!  And love to all of the rest of u ppl too!     *Haley*
