      a very interesting show where they tested the whole of the uk iq level....the test were done annually and showed the iq result according to various aspects such as professions, gender, genetics (red headed, right handed, etc) and age group...  Suprisingly, wales and cardiff score the highest score for the category of city and region...( proud of it..of couse we have the best school for eng, bus, medicine and law, wat do u expect!!)  in the studio they divided people into couple of groups such as doctors, red headed, gardeners, triplets, white van man, models, celebrities and...dats all i think ....and the doctors have the highest score followed by the red headed and the lowest score are the models....  but i do think dat the result is random...although the highest score in the studio is a lady doctor, but a lady that done the test in the net score 150! which is damn high...she's doin i.t stuff and a mensa soc members....  talking about mensa....2 of my relatives are the mensa soc member...guess wat, i'm not bad myself as i once won a place in a training centre dat choose people by their iq level ..and i was selected 15 out of 200 candidates..hehehe...not bad....heheh....but when i'm in the programme, i realised that i'm far too stupid for the cource and quit the course 2 weeks later...so much a high score....hehehehe  aah...that show really waste my time! i should be studyin not watchin the tv!! damn! anyway...i dunno wat happen to me ...i kept picturing him in my mind...and all those time dat we've spent together! miss u kluzd! aaaaaahhhhhhhhh!! get out of my mind!!!

      today i went to see my landlord. he's havin a new baby...his first born...and he's really proud of it...he's a bangladeshi....and his wife was imported from bangladesh..(budak2 melayu blajar aah...import bini)..i remember the first time i saw his wife, she is so skinny and very pemalu....but after givin birth..there's some 'sinar'in her face..and she is beautiful...she gain some weight but she sure look pretty..and i can see the happiness from both of the couple..the baby is so cute and quite fair for a bangladeshi....  he is such a nice man...he used to run this take-away...but now...he's drivin taxi at night so that he can have more time with his baby...my hosemate says dat he used to be one of those 'rugged, 'wanabe' people who went partyin and drinkin but after his brother's accident and after he got married....he surely changed...  such a nice conversation with him...although his wife can't understand or speak any english...but she's smile all the way...which i think is her own way to be friendly...charming though...  time do change people...wats impressed me is that he's not one of those people with high qualifications...but he surely know wat to do with his life.  Do good, be good.....

      I have just finish my first paper today...i dunno how was i doin...i keep on doin and dun even know whether its correct or not.. Man...i miss him....i watch 'friends'today and rachel was having a fight with ross caused ross cheated on him and slept with another woman....  hm....then the thought of him come into my mind...if i and him just could talk over about our relationship and wats 'really' are our relationship...i've been trying to avoid him for 2 years...running away from him..for 2 years...but he always track me down...no matter how far i want to run...  wonder wats in his mind? am i special to him or i'm just his best friend...it's like in the movie when the lady friend fell for his guy friend (wat i mean by this is, they were best friend)....kalo ikut movie the girl will always  get the guy...but only when she makes a lot of sacrifices lah....(such as, tulun him mengurat other girl, help him with his homework and stuff..wonder will that happen to me....)  but wats really pissed me off is that he doesnt make any effort!! nak ke x nak?? kang aku carik org lain kang baru tau....he track me down, and just leave me like that...and make me waitin hopelessly and helplessly...DAMN GUY!!  hehehe..got another paper to go...hv to finish this whole stuff...till another day...ta....
