      my second true love  Aldo Andres Mores.I met him on 21 March 2004. He is the cutest guy I have ever met. He is so wonderful...:)   INITIAL IMPRESSION   He's too good to be true.He has all the physical appeals, that took my breath away.And the softness that melts every pores on my body.I m falling for him..so so deep...  There's many things that I like is also what he likes. It is so surprising ...a person mirroring you....:) unspoken understanding, no words to say, no way to express it, just feeling and feeling..it is soo peaceful being..with him..:)  I cant describe him because it is something I feel within..  An amazing honesty, a true understanding, a pure feeling. I really love him. he is gone from my life. If you can't touch it, you can't feel it, it is GONE. And probably it is better living with our memories..   If I could ask, I would ask for him to be mine. He has never hurt me, not a word..:) He has never say goodbye to me..and I don't want to say it too because he will took my heart away with him.  I will always remember his eyes, his voice, he's singing, he's dancing..everything of him..the sun and the tiger..his angels...:)  mi amor, te quiero..muchos..muchos..

      my first true love  Florian Geraud Demoisson.I met him on 5 April 2000. And he changed many things in my life. I will always remember him, of course.To love someone that long a time, and that deep a feeling. It is amazing..:)     One thing always right is, everything changed through time. Better or worse still nothing's stay.   Love is the best gift from god. How can you ever know the person you laid your eyes that moment changed the way you feel about life, the way you see the world and how strange it will turn your life upside down. It is still a miracle..hmmmm..:)  The first time you knew you are in love, with those pain in your stomach. Churning and warming. And the need to just hearing his voice, to just feel him near you, to just knew he is the person that you love. To get up in the morning to know that you long for his smile and to just think of him as the last thing before you close your eyes every night.You would not asked for more..:)  But then, to love someone is to not hurting the person but at the same time you are just a tiny human, who's so fragile and too vulnerable. To just possibly wanted to ask from god to watch over him all the time and not letting any harm ever touch him. It is wearing every emotions you had down. But in return, the smallest gesture of him pays all the miseries.  But c'est la vie..monsieur..:)  je t'aime..beacoup beacoup..toujours! ta fille..
