      yesterday  wim and i were doing stuff around here and he was trying to get stuff done and i was thinking that i needed to write.  i enjoy writing.  i find it's an excellent release.  and he wants to go to the beach.  i was like, "i don't really feel like the beach."  i was a little ill in the stomach area.  and he's like "what about that park near haarlem?"  and i'm like, "biking's okay, but not that far."  we ended up running three short errands and coming back home.  but before we came home, he said, "do you want to go somewhere?"  i said, "where is there to go?"  he said nothing, we ended up here at home.  but he never took his shoes off - which he always does.  and after a few minutes, he says, "do you want to go to a park?"  i said, "why didn't we go when we were out?"  he said, "i asked you if you wanted to go somewhere?"  i said, "what did i answer?"  he said, "you just said where is there to go?  so i thought you wanted to come home."  i said, "no.  that was your cue to answer the question."  i said, "i need time to write.  i'm not going to have time for a while and i need to finish that piece."  he left.  he stayed away for an hour and a half or two.  when he returned, i was finished and pumped up.  we had great sex.  i really think he needs to learn that that's a good investment of his time.  leave me alone to wrote and i'll fuck you're brains out later.  seems like a fair trade off to me.

      i could tell for the past few days that wim has wanted sex.  the other night i was dog tired from our bike rides and running around and we got in bed and i read a bit and then I turned off the light.  he was on me suddenly, kissing and stuff.  i was kissing him back, but i was clearly giving him the "no, this is not going to happen" signal.  the next morning i had a pain in my neck and back and then last night it was like 1:00 before we got to bed.  so this morning, i thought it was about time - and i was looking forward to sex too - so i initiated it.  bland city.  one of the great things about our relationship is that the sex is great.  i won't go into details, but it's quite nice.  its' like one time out of twenty that it's not great.  today was that day.  he just laid there and sort of waited for things to happen.  i got the message and made quick work of it.  that chore's taken care of for now.  i can tell he's sort of pissy still.  we ran errands today and he's been sort of cold.  i'm a total fan of oprah.  and i know that what i need to do right now is extend myself and ask what's up and all that.  i so don't want to.  i feel like he should step the fuck up and say something.  so i'll say something.  we have family over tonight for dinner.  i'm glad it's friday.  i'm glad our second week of vacation is over and i can have some time to myself.    when i suggested the other day that he go out alone so i could have some time alone for an evening, it was like i had said i didn't like him any more.  i just need some time to myself.  my history and all.  i should write about that.  i don't want to hammer on him all the time.  he's really a great guy.  i've been with a lot and i know he's a keeper.  and 90% of the time he's loving a fun.  he's just going through a little time right now.  fortunately he knows he needs to let me write here.

      little mr. wim was sort of pissy all day.  i'm not sure why.  but i asked him several times before and he always has some dumbass answer.  one time when we were on a trip with some friends, he was a pissy and i asked later, "what's up?"  he said, with a sigh, "i saw you looking at that guy at the airport."  i was like, "what?"  he said, "when we were all sitting there."  i said, "who?"  he said, "don't pretend you don't know.  the skinny guy with the short hair.  and another time you were looking at an old guy pushing a wheel chair."  i said, "listen, mr.  are you saying i was flirting with someone?"  he said, "you were obviously trying to make eye contact."  i said, "to what end?  and why would i be flirting with some old guy pushing a wheel chair."  i said, "wim, i look at people.  and i don't do this jealousy thing.  if you want to get yourself all worked up over me making eyes at a skinny guy - and you know how i hate skinny guys - and some old guy pushing a wheelchair, you go right ahead.  i am not playing."  after that he got all boo-hoo and apologized.  i can't take that shit.  later i said, "if you're pissed off at me, say somthing.  i can't be the one to constantly be monitoring your feelings.  you're an adult.  take responsibilty!"  so he got like that today and i thought, who the hell cares?  when he wants to talk about me being some kind of shitty girlfriend, then he can.  until then, i know how to act oblivious.  but it's like some bell goes off and suddenly i know that i've done something.  its' like a silent, invisible shield comes down and i can tell he's left.  in the big picture, i think, if this is the worst of it, i can take it.  he's usually tons of fun

      the other day a friend told me about blogging.  i thought i would give it a look.  i found some of them interesting and i thought i would give it a try.  mostly, tho, i need a place to vent some of my frustrations about my wonderful (possibly, soon to be) husband, wim.  wim isn't really his name, but it's dutch enough and i don't want to use his real name in case anyone we know should come across this and tell him about it.  i would talk to my mother or friends about the frustrations i am having, but i don't want to get a lot of "i told you so" and if there's one thing my mother loves, it's that fucking phrase.  i told you not to move over there.  i told you you'd hate it.  thing is, i don't.  i totally love it here - we live in amsterdam.  i've been here about a year and i'm getting my bearings.  but wim has some habits and ways that i find a little difficult to handle some times, and that's what this is about.  plus i don't need to be reminded about something i complained about over and over.  i can put it here and let it rest.  so if no one ever reads this, i don't really care.  and if everyone reads it, i don't mind that either.  i just need a place to unload and tell about those things that piss me off.  and there are some things that he does that are so sicky sweet i think i'll just throw up - and i love them.  so i hope to tell those things too.

      wim is out of town.  it's been like five days since he left.  it'll be another week until he's back.  strange to be alone in the house for so long.  i keep busy, but i don't particularly like spending every single night alone.  it's a little lonely and wim's fun to be around.  he calls and i miss him.  problem is he talks so softly because he's in an office full of people, and he's never been very loud on the phone.  the house has completely gone to pieces.  i'm barely keeping it habitable.  i walk through and i think, "wim would go nuts with this."  i knew it was bad when i walked past a pair of undies on the dining room floor.  there are clothes all over the living room, dishes in the sink, laundry that needs to be folded, the bed's unmade.  and books and papers - some of which i am using to study and some i dragged out for reference material - all over the couch and dining room table.  he's lose it.  i have to do a major cleaning on saturday.  and i've been smoking.  he wouldn't like that one bit.  that might actually be a deal breaker.  i know he would really not like it.  it sort of scares me when i sit here, having smoked, and get paranoid.  but i have to keep saying, "you have until saturday to smoke - maybe sunday."  he wouldn't come home early.  i know it.  and it's not like there's smoke all over the house.  it's just that i'm thinking about it.  i do miss him.  i wonder sometimes if i'm being good enough to him.  i try to let him know all the time that i love him and that i want to be with him.  i think he's a little fearful that i won't be staying.  it's kind of crazy thinking, but then it makes me wonder what kind of partner i'm being.  i so don't want to start taking him for granted.  i think that's a total death to a relationship.  i'm a 37 year old, no kids, well educted, american woman.  i'm so not living a normal life.  i want to live somewhere fabulous and have a nice relationship and a normal life.  i want to write and do work that i love and think it great.  i want to feel secure and happy.  and i think i'm well on the way to getting that.  wim is such a wonderful man and so very loving.  and he challenges me in a lot of ways, good ways.  i hate to think i could lose him.  thing is i know that all he really wants is to be loved.  and that he enjoys being loved by me.  i think we're a really good match.  and he's good with the no kid thing, so that's very nice.

      wim remains away.  had a friend by yesterday to chat.  wim had asked him to drop by, as he was concerned about me being alone and not having anyone to talk to.  sweet thing trying to take care of me even from far away.  got stoned and talked to my sister, katie, last night for a while.  she's having some stupid affair with a cop in oklahoma.  it's rediculous.  the guy's wife found out and the guy hasn't called in a few days.  i was nothing if not completely brilliant in my responses to her.  i was like, it's okay to screw up and fall down, but at some point you have to get up and move on.  she just loves to hang on to shit.  but look at your hands!  now they're full of shit!  had coffee with a new friend yesterday.  at least i hope she's a new friend.  sort of in the same situation as me with the dutch partner and all.  again there was a marriage proposal and a pause and then an open invitation.  she's young.  like 22 or something.  very sweet.  found out from the friend, the first mentioned here, that wim thinks i've had a pretty adventurous life up to now - and he's right.  when katie and i were talking about writing one time, she said, "well, could you just make stories up, too?"  and i said, "sugar, with my life, i don't need to make anything up."  wim hasn't been as...adventurous as me.  he's a cautious person.  i think caution is for sissies.  grab the fuckin' bull by the fuckin' horns.  you want it?  go after it - and look good doin' it.

      wim finally got out of the apartment yesterday.  i was really sad to see him go.  he finally called from the airport - as i had encouraged him to - and we talked for a bit.  then i went into action.  i needed to get to the supermarket for dinner supplies, the liquor store for a bottle of scotch and a coffee shop in town for a bit of weed.  i've smoked weed for years.  but wim, being dutch, doesn't smoke.  you're average real dutchman doesn't smoke weed.  it's very tourist.  i know i don't need to smoke, so i don't.  but one of the great things about wim going out of town is that I can smoke.  i haven't smoked since i moved here.  i've had a piece of space cake, but i haven't actually smoked.  well, the liquor store was closed already, but i got some groceries and then, after a short investigation via the internet, i went to a highly rated coffee shop and bought three grams of "mother's delight."  had i known how much a gram is, i wouldn't have bought so much.  it was eight euro per gram and twenty-one euro for three.  i got three.  one would have done me, but i was a little embarrassed at being such a novice.  the guy was totally cool, very matter of fact, irish, i think.  there was an american chick there.  we just nodded.  the guy who sold it to me was the dealer.  i chose mother's delight because there was no "umma gumma."  i didn't want to ask about it for fear that the guy would say, "that's a hash, dumb bitch."  when i got home, i started dinner, called the airline to make sure wim's plane had taken off, rolled a dubbie, which i hadn't actually done in like twelve years, and took a hit.  i'd been warned by a woman at church to not smoke the whole thing down as that could totally have put me on the floor for the evening.  one hit did me for a while.  strange to smoke a dube in this house, although i kept blowing the smoke outside.  had a strange vision of wim coming home suddenly because of some airplane difficulty.  and i would be totally fucked.  there would be no way out.    i watched "moulin rouge," the movie.  i'd seen it years ago with a boyfriend.  it was a bit tedious, sweet, but tedious.  and then it made me miss wim and feel bad that i've been a less than stellar girlfriend to him at times recently.  Very sweet movie, though.  and i kept eating.  i'd stocked up for it.  the vegetables i made for dinner were way too spicy.  i threw in a pepper and then threw in another.  then i absent mindedly scratched the inside of my nose.  hello!  when the movie was over, i sat and wrote for almost two hours.  i'm not sure if any of it's good, but it was too fun to stop.  i once had a chance to be a sculptor and the guy i was an apprentice for said, "bonnie, you're good, but you don't sculpt like a sculptor.  a sculptor would be sculpting at every chance.  you go weeks without sculpting."  i'd had a crush on the guy - a little older (my current age) - and he helped me decide what my next move would be, while i continued to be studio assistant.  and now i write like he sculpted.  crazily, into the night.  sit and start and hours later i realize it's been hours.  and delighted at what i've written, delighted at the process.  my latest obsession/project is something about all the guys i've been with.  once with a group of other women i worked with, all of them younger, the subject of partners came up and one little bitch said, "hey, let's make lists of who we've done it with."  Like names and a list in order.  she had eight and said, "i'm so embarrassed.  i can't remember kenny's last name."  i just sat there.  i've had a lot of sex.  i didn't know where to begin.  and i knew that if i started there, i was not going to be able to finish.  so i started a list several days later.  and every once in a while i still add to it when i think of another guy.  "that guy with the red shirt and eye twitch in alberqueque."  can't remember kenny's last name?  can't remember why the name horace sounds familiar and is linked with the smell of cocoa powder!  so my project was to put them on a paper (done) order them as much as possible (done) and write a scenerio about each one, what i remember etc.  it's fun in a way.  a little depressing with some, but interesting.  i don't have to worry about libelousness as it might never get published.  but i wanted a chronicle of who i'd done it with.  i also want to start another list of "who i didn't have sex with."  ones i got close to doing it with, but didn't.  would also be interesting.  i do love to write.

      wim is about to go out of town for like twelve days.  he's been packing and doing things all day in preparation.  he's been so quiet that it made me feel like i'd done something.  finally i went up to him as he lay on the bed and i said, "are you being moody because you're about to go out of town, or have i done something?"  he looked at me and said, "you haven't done anything."  like it was the most obvious thing in the world.  i said, "i never know."  and i really don't.  it sort of bothers me, but it's just the way he is.  he's quiet and he needs to spend time thinking about what he's packed and what he hasn't.  and i know he wants to have sex before he leaves for the airport.  so i said, "i'm going to go take a shower and then maybe a nap."  this has been a good signal in the past that i am going to ready myself for sex.  i don't mind wake up and fuck sex - in fact i like it a lot - but not if we're dirty, and we were.  he was laying on the bed.  it was about two in the afternoon and neither of us had showered yet - or even brushed our teeth.  so i come out all cleaned up and he's still laying there.  i think he wanted to get it going, or he expected me to, but he's sort of sticky and his breath stunk.  i thought, man, i'd love to do you right now, but you stink.  but i can't tell him that or he'll get offended.  oh well.  i'll survive without sex for that long.  i've got plenty to do.  the problem is that i think he uses our sexual activity as a barometer of how our relationship is going, which is not a good thing in my book.

      sweet, sweet wim.  i know he's nuts about me, but the last two days, i've wanted to kick him out of bed.  our morning ritual is to wake up, with the alarm, and one of us says, "coffee?" well, the last two mornings, i asked and he said, "i'll go."  At that point, he rolls over and cuddles me for a bit.  a bit being like fifteen minutes.  and i'm like totally jonesing for a cup of coffee.  finally i say, "coffee" or get up and get it myself, as i did yesterday.  i am one of the luckiest bitches on the planet and it seems like all i can do is gripe about a man that just loves me to pieces.  fortunately i don't gripe to him.  when he corrects me when i am speaking dutch, i just say, "okay, thanks."  but this morning, i was like "dude, it's time for some joe!"

      wim had to go out of town yesterday and won't be back until this morning.  i've been detoxing off of caffiene pretty steadily for a while.  this combo turned out to be not so nice yesterday.  in my lonliness towards the end of the day, i decided to have a cup of tea and a few cookies.  then when i went to bed, my body would not turn off.  it was creapy not having wim in bed next to me and i couldn't go to sleep.  it didn't occur to me until this morning that it might have been the extra caffiene.  i always think time away is going to be nice, but i find myself lonely at the end of the day.  i mean i can keep busy like nobody's business, and i was certainly online enough, but it's nice to have someone to make a cup of tea for - and to complain about.  in the time before i met wim i was alone a lot.  and fine with it.  i've had enough relationships to last me if things with wim don't work out or if he should, god forbid, die.  i don't think i'd want another relationship.  wim is pretty great and i'd sort of like him to be my last big love.  i've been the last big love for two men.  it's an honor, in a very perverse, sad way.  it would give me more time to write.  i feel like my love beaker has been filled.  i made a list of men i've been with and it's...enough.  not all "loves" with a capital L, but enough sex and enough strong feelings.  i miss wim and i look forward to him being here tonight.

      last night wim was thick with attitude.  i said, "is there something wrong?"  he mumbled something about me being married to the computer.  i started to deny it, but then i realized that he's right.  i spend quite a bit of time on the computer, and he felt hurt, pushed out of my life.  so all i could do is apologise.  turns out that when he left saturday, it wasn't a good thing.  he felt like he was being pushed out of the house - and, really, he sort of was.  so now i have to refrain from using the computer when he's home, except to do very specific tasks - like checking who an actor is by logging into imdb.com.  but i can't get sucked into the vortex that "that black box" (his reference to my computer) is.  i really realized that i was wrong and that i needed to admit it and 'fess up.  my initial reaction is to deny, deny, deny.  eleven years of therapy put to good use.  however, not checking my e-mail before going to bed was hard!  i love him, but i know that without him, my life is in a very precarious position.  i hate to make decisions based on that, but it's true and i have to factor it in.  that said, i didn't apologise because i was afraid (as i hate making decisions based on fear) but because i knew i was wrong.  at bedtime, of course we had sex.  and this morning i stayed in bed and he was just a cuddly puppy.  he just wants to be loved.  he's not that complex.  he just wants me to love him and be true to him.  he had a pretty bad experience before and he needs consistency.  i had some bad experiences, but i handled them in different ways.  hence, i feel like i have more shell than him.

      i got out of bed this morning at 7:10.  i had some things to do.  then i got an e-mail that said my computer might have a virus and that i should download this file.  i was born at night, but it wasn't last night.  i deleted the e-mail, but decided to run a virus check, which involved updating my virus software.  a little while later, i noticed wim moving around.  he seemed a little quiet, but that kind of quiet where i know that he is being extra quiet on purpose.  and i thought, what the hell did i do now?  later on i realized that i'd gotten out of bed and started moving around.  when i first moved, we would lay in bed and talk for a while every morning, and especially at the beginning we had sex like every morning.  he has the kind of job where he can go in when he pleases.  he likes me to lay there and he likes to try to get something going.  i, on the other hand, am an early riser.  before i moved here, i used to get up at 6:00, just to be up and do things.  i would sleep in until 8:00 and it felt luxurious.  wim doesn't even stir on a normal day until 8:00 and he'll sleep until 10:00.  half the fuckin' day is over by then!  so i realized he's pissy because i haven't laid in bed and cuddled for a few days.  i just like getting up and going.  i like sitting alone and having a cup of coffee.  if it's 9:45 and he's laying on top of me trying to put his tongue in my mouth, i tend to get a little impatient.  so i have to do a little backpeddling today and stroke his ego, among other things.  he's sweet, though.  it may not sound like it, but i looked at him the other day and my heart fluttered.  we're just still adjusting to things.  he accepts when i say, this is how i am.  but he doesn't always like the reality when i am the way i am.  but he's in love with me.  i just push his limits.  i didn't lie to him.  i said, this is how i am.  he agreed.
