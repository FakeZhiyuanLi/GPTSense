      And I'm a happy camper.

      Last night we had our first practice time in months. We've been doing so many gigs, that we just haven't had time to bunker down and go through the songs again. After two weeks of holiday it was super to be making noise with the boys again. Working on a new track as well. Very vibey, there's a bit of a Veils influence going on there, but different. Not quite sure what it'll be called. Hopefully we'll be playing it live before the summer is over.

      This week I'm helping my parents paint the outside of their house. Today, though, I had to go back home to pick up some things for our gig tomorrow. Coming into my house there is fine dust  everywhere ! Adem, the painter (who'se been around for more than a month now. Our house is not that big, he is very slow), is now working on the front of our house, and chose to open all the windows so that all the sawdust coming off the windowsills has nestled nicely into our bedroom, living room, hallway, kitchen and guestroom.  I am not happy.

      The tricky thing at the moment is as follows; my personality and character make me seem - and also want to seem - so much more confident about things than my philosophy and experience are trying to dictate. This might seem complex, so let me explain a bit further. In any discussion, theoretical or otherwise, I tend to try to distill matters so that they are simple, straightforward and black/white. My real experiences of things, however, tend to be quite otherwise.   Everything I have experienced lately - everything I have heard that has rung true - seems to be much less black-and-white than I am prone to communicate to others. I want life to be cut and dried, but it's not.   So really, the best thing to do is to start processing reality as a continuous discussion, a give and take, a life in shades of gray. But I find that hard. Somehow there's still a glitch in my brain that keeps me trying to put things in simple boxes, and trying to explain everything as if I know it all. But I don't.   I don't know it all, but I'm having a hard time putting these realizations into action.

      Gerinke has been gone to Colombia for more than three weeks now. In exactly a week she'll be back in my arms.  I miss her.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      If all is well, I have taken my last test for university, and am now officially a Boring Old Man. To kill time (as if time has ever begged to be killed) I am reading more again.  My last few fiction discoveries were pretty decent, so I thought I'd share them with you.&nbsp;    &nbsp;   The Autograph Man - Zadie Smith   Borrowed this from my Dad, I think he got this through some book club when he forgot to order in time. Not a bad choice of the month. Surreal, weird, and intensely human. Describes friendships the way I'd like to have them in my life (And the way they often are too. Which is a Good Thing.) If you don't mind occasional bizarre plot-twists, then this is a good starter. The only thing that bugged me a bit was the open end. There are days when I want my stories all tied up and finished at the end.    &nbsp;   Vernon God Little - DBC Pierre&nbsp;&nbsp;   A haunting dive into low-class no-hope American countryside. Some have compared it to a modern-day Catcher in the Rye, and they could be right. A fascinating description of the inside of a disturbed teenager's head. Whereas Autograph Man's ending was too open, this one might be a bit too closed for some.&nbsp; Not the easiest novel to read, nor to always understand, but worth it nonetheless.      The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time - Mark Haddon&nbsp;   An autistic child goes for an adventure in London City. It sounds like a kid's book, but it's a brilliant read. I did groaning and then I felt better. Fantastic! This is Rainman with a very strange, very British twist. How anybody could dive into the head of a young autist like that leaves me spellbound. The story will keep you up till you've finished it. That won't take long though, I finished it in about four hours.   Read more books, you'll become a Better Person.

      Last night I came back from a short but cold and wet holiday in the Czech Republic. The Wookie, Kung Fu and I had a great time. When your wife is gone, it's always good to be able to leave with your best friends.  &nbsp;  The weather could have been better, but the last two days were glorious.&nbsp;&nbsp;The beer was cheap, the friends were there, it was a blast. Of course I was too much of a coward&nbsp;to go for a swim. But&nbsp;somehow I don't see the point of going into cold water. The pros of swimming just don't add&nbsp;up to the cons of having to go through the first stages of the cold water. Once the water hits the inside of my knees, I've gone far enough. Ask my wife, I'm a coward when swimming.  &nbsp;
