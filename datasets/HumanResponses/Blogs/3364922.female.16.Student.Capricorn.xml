      an oldie, but i still like.  A broken heart, divide in two Half of it i'll share with you Then you can experience what i went through The judgement and betrayal, just to get to you Splitting headaches, screams of pain As you hurt me, and drove me insane Now i have no heart to share with you It was destroyed in the ashes as i burnt you.  hmm. a reminder of my past, most likely my future.

      please, allow me to inform you on my joyous horoscpe for this week. 'You are feeling a great desire to escape or withdraw into yourself. This can be a very depleting and confusing time when you do not know exactly what you want. You do not feel strong, capable or effective. Physically you need to be gentle with yourself and take care not to dissipate your energy reserves.  notice it says i'm born in the year of the rabbit in my profile? well. it's wrong. i was born in the year of the dragon, 1987 is actually the year of the rabbit. *sigh*

      Run away from home No where else to go slashing up her wrists 'till they're just blood and bone And they say it's a beautiful world To see all these wonderful things.  It's now nine twenty-three and we still haven't heard not a sound not a whisper not a motor down the freeway. It's dark outside,  and cold What's a beautiful world?  Just give me my guitar and perhaps a tambourine or a book of lyrics. Lyrics of a dieing man who feels there is no time. Then let's see who's happy Now can you tell me, what's a beautiful world?  Face the day, awake the night Wear long sleeves to cover the wounds this is what a beautiful world can give. Look at the pretty colour on the edge of life.  Nine twenty-seven A last breath A shiver down the spine Drowned in murky waters Blood-edged knife Blood-edged life Now can you tell me, what's a beautiful world?

      this is my life. boring useless and has absolutly no point to it. see? look. my life---> [                               ] it's empty. how sad.  name: Nakita Age: 16 Sex: yes please Location:  Perth, Western Australia Pets: 2 cats, a dog and prince- the eastern rosella. fish too. koi. i think.  i have a couple of things to do in my spare time. i paint. and draw. and write stuffs, even though i'm not very good at any of it...oh well, i can try. i play netball three times a week, which i don't like at the best of times, but i have to find something to do when i'm not here. any comments on how to improve any pictures or posts are welcomed.   i'm addicted to the net, strategy games, music and my guitar.  i just painted my room! it's dark royal blue the bottom half, and dark dragon green the top. it has a strip of wall paper dividing the two colours, red to contrast with green, and orange to contrast with blue. very niceness.  *yawn*  hmm. i'm boring. i'm 5"7 hmmm. unique features about me. i have funky changy colour eyes. green when i'm cold, hazel when i wake up, and ugly murky greeny most other times. kinda wierd yet fun looking at photos.  i have an opinion on myself that i need to lose wieght, though most people just start arguments with me. grr. i like that word. grr.  i don't usually sleep at night, a night owl, a zombie. i lurk around the streets, when allowed. (i'm still only 16 though i wish i weren't)  i'm a capricorn: grounded, argumentative, always wants her own way, stubborn, out of touch, artistic, cool, responsible, reliable, honest and loyal. oh yeah, and a pain in the ass.  meh. that's all for now.

      i returned a comment today. hehe. some fella reckons i have my head up my ass? i thought if you had your head up your ass you couldn't see anything? hmm. i actually think it might have been one of my friends from school, though it's hard to tell. well, she can't spell anyway. a boring day i found myself to be in today. nothing seemed to go right, well not really anyway. but that's pretty usual. i've had my photos developed from the school ball two weeks ago, i might shove some up here when i can be bothered.  down to my last coke, until netball anyway. damn.

      i can't wait to get out of here.  i'm being force fed five medications a day. -the pill, for iron and other things. -a mineral tablet to keep ,my health up due to the  -iron defficency tablets that arn't working so i'm consantly feeling like shit -an iron defficency tonic that tastes like shit, because the tablets aren't enough and -some tablet for insomnia to help me sleep- which by the way DOESN'T WORK.  see why i hate parents? all these things they dose me up on, forcing me to take them, as if i haven't already had enough of life as it is they shove all this shit into me, now if i stop the doses i probably will develop some disease or major flu that isn't curable. that's four tablets every day and a tonic, i'm only sixteen for god's sake.  i'm actually beginning to not only look like a zombie, but feel like one too. grr.

      i had to get up at six this morning, it's seven now, the sun just waking. i woke up before the sun was up so decided to go for a quick walk. it's not the same as night, doesn't have the eerie feel. it had the 'hey look it's saturday feel' ...and ;you should be sleeping in' feel... i'm going to luke's today, he'll be here in half an hour so i can catch three buses and a train to his house. i should walk half way really. can't be bothered.  i have myself a sore back asvwell. which is going to smite me tomorrow at superleague netball. dammit.  yesterday was shit too. i had a two our non-stop argument with my stupid dad because he wouldn't admit he was in the wrong (which most adults don't!) and i was the one ending up upset and slamming a door in his face.. and i did slam it in his face, only because whenever i tried to voice my opinion he would go 'la la la la' at the top of his voice. grrrrrrrr.is that not annoying? no thanx to him i now have another mark to add to the collection.  gnight

      what a shit day. i found a little dove in our house today, she was still alive. my stupid cat had badly mauled her. she had no tail feathers left, and one of her wings were broken, but she seemed ok. she must have been in shock.  she last all day while i was at school. all day! nine whole hours on her lonesome in a cardboard box with a towel around her to keep warm. she died, just now.  poor thing.  i hope she wasn't in too much pain...

      what a weekend. grr.  firday was good. i liked friday. friday is before saturday. saturday is usually good. saturday was shit.  saturday i was at bills house, shovelling sand, levelling sand, laying grass, and building a limestone brick wall. from eight in the morning! the sun was up!!! and it rained too! saturday afternoon i was still at bills working my ass off, luke came over. saturday night i was babysitting, with luke, my two little cousins aged 5 and 9. that was a nightmare. you think the little brats would go to bed? or listen? or have a shower??? no..... stupid little critters. luke and i got to bed ourselves at about 2:30 that morning and we were both stuffed. sunday we had a wake up call at 6:00, we made the kiddies breakfast, then made them lunch and finally went back to bills, worked some more, then went home. we dropped luke off back home, then went to joondalup to see dads friend for his birthday, stayed until midnight. came home, and now i'm here...great huh?  meh.

      darkness haunts the streets tonight zombies walk across the park, i am tired, insane, bewildered by the creatures inside my head twirling around into depths of night  waiting for a chance to burst  i know, 'night' doesn't fit. i have yet to come up with something a little more tasteful.

      I hate Wednesdays, especially this Wednesday. Today I had an English in class essay, it was an easy piece to write, but a boring topic. Advertising. Values, media, billboards, themes, attitudes,SWAT codes (symbolic, audio, written and technical),all that crap. I also had work studies today, and was notified of a couple assignments overdue, oh well. I'll work on that later. hmm I had human biology- a test tomorrow on gaseous exchange (the respiratory system, its structure, and functions of its structures).umm yeah. That should be fairly easy. I had maths, which was extremely boring. Yuck. I hate maths,   I had art today too, one of my favourite subjects. not today though  I have a tonal portrait over due and the teacher is pissing me off by asking for it, BUT she's the one that fucked it up in the first place. I had it finished the way  I  wanted it, but  noooo , the eyes weren't good enough, the shirt wasn't good enough, the paint wasn't light enough. So she decides to try and fix it herself! She scribbles all over it with texta, saying that 'this isn't right', or 'that isn't right' or 'this could be better'   bah. It's my work, I was happy with it, and now I have to paint over the bloody thing again.   grr.  *grumbles some profanity*  apart from that, my day was all well and dandy. A tad cold, but I got my walk the night before, my walk home from school, and my netball game (which we won) at six.  *grin*

      i liked today. i like this weather- only because it's not cold. but i hate rain. blah  i recieved a phone call the other night from a guy that i really hate. i knew him when i was younger, he's umm either 19 or 20 and is still as much as a jerk now as he was then, i really hated talking, but i thought it was rude to just hang up.  i tried to finish my art project with no success once again, luckily our teacher was away and we had a relief teacher. yay! my human biology test didn't go too bad, i think i passed. the english inclass was easier than i thought, passed with a breeze i hope.  i made a potato salad for lunch tomorrow, yummm....  i actually ate VEGETARIAN lasagne for dinner. yuck! i had no choice, you see i am on a diet and dad and jarryd wanted kfc- which i think is pretty gross anyway. but when you know you shouldn't be eating it, you tend to REALLY want it... so i had to share mums dinner... ick.

      Today is a good day. I don't care what happens in it, even if I don't do anything it is still a good day. Tuesday and Wednesdays are good days too! Thursday is a bad day, but is also a good day because Friday follows and Friday is a good day.  you see, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday I have no school. Which means I have no overdue essays, no art projects, no homework. Nothing! Thursday I have my human biology exam. That is bad. Yuck. Three hours of sitting at a desk writing answers to some sixty five questions that I don't know anything about.  so to make up for no school on these other days I have to study this exam for two hours to make sure I at least pass. But hey, two hours of study is better than six of school. I'd take that any day.  so today, I'm free. Nothing to worry about, no hassles, just give the house a quick face lift, and undo the knot in my room, that's it!  yay..  no credit though... damn.

      What a nice week. sort of. Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday went quite well. I didn't talk to anyone, I sat here all day, went for a walk to the shops, and went to netball. No school!  Thursday I had my human biology exam, I think that went well. One of those exams where it was really easy in some parts, and a bit difficult in others.  I think I passed, I hope anyway.  I have another day off today. yay.  I wanted to go for a walk, but awoke to find a piece of paper stuck on the cupboard door "keet can you please do the dishes and vacuuming for me today, and hang the clothes out. ta luv MUM" tsk. she likes keeping me at home.  damn her to hell.  looks like I have a busy day. If I get it all done by one, I can have a little walk....'till two...

      hello there.  i had fun today:) i got to school, found out that my exam went wuite well. i got 64% in my human biology exam, which is better than what i thought i was going to do, in other words i thought i might have failed! for my other subjects, work studies, maths, senior english, art, and cooking fundamentals i'm also getting high grades. that's good!  i saw  shrek 2  the other day, i thought it was shit. it's quite boring and not half as good as the first movie. all the interesting bits of the movie were spoiled by television commercials, and newspapers, as usual.  there is a  garfield  movie coming out!!!! garfield is the best, he rocks. i can't wait to see it. i collect garfield comics, have tonnes of them. and other favourites are  wizard of id, zits , and  cats with hands . i like most of those sorts. they are funny. hehe  hmm.  bored now.  so much to talk about, but i really can't be bothered.  *yawn*

      hello everyone  &nbsp;  well. what a week hey.  &nbsp;  i've got nothing special to talk about this week.  &nbsp;  my boyfriend and i aren't doing well at all, at the moment. but everyone is telling me to just hang on and see how it works out.  i guess i can do that.  as long as he doesn't hurt me again.  &nbsp;  umm  &nbsp;  i'm going ice skating tomorrow. a good start to a new week, i think.  yeah.  &nbsp;  i like ice skating. very relaxing. i'm taking a morning session, so it should be pretty quiet too. (good for speed skating:P)  &nbsp;  i told dad i didn't want to play superleague on sundays anymore.  he hasn't had a sad at me that big for a long time!  he's the coach you see, and for the last 8 weeks of netball i've only played half a game or less, which REALLY sucks, as i feel i haven't made any sort of contribution to the game or anything, so i decided to quit.  &nbsp;  meh.  &nbsp;  i'll miss it, but i'd rather not play, than only play half games every week.  &nbsp;  one less day wasted in the week.  &nbsp;  one more day to organise fun stuffs.  &nbsp;  or to sit here.&nbsp; &nbsp;   hmm&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; i wish i could get some sleep...&nbsp;
