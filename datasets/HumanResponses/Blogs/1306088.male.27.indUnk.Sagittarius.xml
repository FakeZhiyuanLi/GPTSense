      Well, Field Day was a blast this year. I was at the site from 2pm Saturday afternoon until 9am Sunday morning. I was glad I brought my 6 meter setup, as the band opened up nicely out west and into Texas and Louisana. Colorado and western Nebraska were also contacted by  urlLink W8VP.  As an added bonus, some friends and I worked a young lady in Texas with a very sexy voice. Ahh the  urlLink Magic Band . . . I love a good band opening.   Today I helped a ham friend troubleshoot his 2 meter mobile setup. He has a Kenwood TM-261A that starts buzzing when he transmits on high power. It works fine on mid and low power, and he can run high power without problems with the engine running. I suspected he had a voltage drop. Sure enough, he did. His power cord to the battery is about twice as long as it needs to be, and is joined in the middle with a small gauge wire that probably can't handle 10 amps @ 12 volts. When his alternator runs, the car voltage ramps up to 13.8 volts, which overcomes the loss in the power cable. I fixed it temporarily, but I think he'll eventually need a shorter, thicker power cable ran directly from the radio to the car battery.   On the job front I took a look at some job apps, one from a gas station and another from a grocery store. I'll fill them out and deliver them tomorrow.  I've been struggling to write a program in Pascal to incorporate Fibonacci's sequence. I haven't thought about it enough to make any progress. I think that taking real-world problems and translating them into mathematical expressions is the hardest part of computer programming. So far it hasn't been easy to learn some of this stuff because my understanding of calculus and even algebra is weak.

      Wouldn't it be refreshing if politicians actually said what they thought?  urlLink Cheney has done just that.  Bad day, indeed.

      I take back the minor complement I gave Bill Clinton in an earlier post. In his  urlLink interview with the BBC,  Clinton seems to place blame for his problems at others' feet. His inability to effectively combat the growing Al Qaida threat is due to not wanting to be perceived as "changing the subject" from the Starr investigation. He pulls a Perot and repeatedly makes references to others' driving his ambitions, not himself. I did find the theme of parallel lives in the interview to be an interesting study in the man who still holds such sway over the Democratic party.   I find it strange that he says he did all he could to combat terrorism, and that he couldn't have invaded Afghanistan without raising distrust and fear in the international community. I'll concede that. But by his own admission he could have done more to put pressure on the people who struck at our embassies overseas and the USS Cole. I know that when it comes to 9/11, there's plenty of blame to spread around. But to place the majority of the blame on the nine month old Bush administration is blind partisanship. I think its clear that September 11 was such a event that nothing could've been done to stop it. At least, not without the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.

      As a staunch Republican with some socially moderate views, I find the coverage of Bill Clinton's  urlLink My Life  quite interesting.  I find it refreshing that he admits he made mistakes, even though it seems that he takes every opportunity to bash Ken Starr. Because, after all, we all know that the Monica Lewinsky scandal was Starr's fault, not Bill's.   Yeah, right.   Starr was always the left's whipping boy during the independent counsel investigation. I do not believe that Starr was motivated by a venomous, nearly rabid hate of Bill Clinton. Starr was not desperate to bring down Clinton at any cost. He was not the visible face of some nebulous "right wing conspiracy." He was a man driven by duty and the rule of law. To see Clinton's excesses and indiscretions during his investigation must have lit a fire under him. He was outraged, as anybody who holds the office of the Presidency sacred should be. As My Life shows, Starr was not Clinton's worst enemy. Clinton himself was.   During a  urlLink BBC interview,  Clinton became visibly angry and indignant after a series of tough questions about the Lewinsky affair. He's as tired of the Lewinsky mess as everybody else. People, just read the book and shut up.  I will do both.

      As a followup to a previous post, the Time Warner Cable Online site was actually urlLink  www.twcol.com.   Unfortunately, I couldn't find a relevant job posting related to the newspaper ad on that site. Geez!

      I spent the day providing amateur radio communications for the  urlLink The Great Ohio Bicycle Adventure.  Its a tour of Ohio that's held every year in a different part of the state. Its got some great scenery if you're willing to view it while pumping your heart out across this fine country. The  urlLink hams  on the event covered a huge route that crossed three counties. Its doubtful that the event would be possible without our support.   Yesterday I called the local municipal court about my application for network technician. The woman that answered said that she'd received over 40 applications, and that she'd be conducting interviews in mid-July. Hopefully I'll make at least the first cut. Even if I don't get the job, I'd feel better about myself if I just had an interview with a live human being. Yes, I'm just that desperate.   I also noticed a local gas station is hiring. I got an application, but was told that the HR person would be calling for interviews TODAY. I may try to return it by the end of the week and see if it will still be accepted.

      If I was a conspiracy nut, I would find  urlLink this  rather interesting. A commercial jet lands at a military airport and the passengers are instructed to pull the shades on their windows and not look outside. Creepy. This comes after I watched the latest Bond installment Die Another Day. In the movie all hell breaks loose in the Korean DMZ and it makes the papers as a "freak electrical storm". Art imitates life, or vice versa?   I saw an ad in today's paper about a tech support position for Time Warner Cable in the cable internet division. Its an ideal position for me, since I have experience in customer service and tech support over the phone to friends who can't seem to get their computers up and running. The ad stipulates that I visit  urlLink www.twol.com  to apply for the gig. The wierd thing is, the site at that address has no relation to Time Warner Cable, at least none that I can discern. Creepy.

      I spent today working on that simple Pascal program that I couldn't get to compile a few evenings ago. It turns out I was trying to change the value of a identifier that I had declared a constant. A rookie mistake. That's appropriate, considering I'm a rookie.   I tried programming a few years ago in college, but I had no idea what the hell I was doing since the classes moved so quickly. Plus we were using C++, which I've been told is overload for beginning programmers. I have the distinct feeling that all those folks I was in class with coded every day before they ate dinner. Or, instead of dinner. Either way, they knew craploads more than me.   I'm also trying out Pascal because a.) Its easy to get a compiler and run it under Linux, and b.) I'm really bored and looking for something to occupy my time during job searching.  I saw an ad in the local paper today about needing help at a gas station. I don't relish the prospect of doing that kind of work again, but I'm running out of options. I think I'll ask for an application the next time I'm in town.

      I took it easy today. I spent some time watching From the Earth to the Moon on DVD.  Also, I had a wicked grounding issue here in the radio shack. When my computer keyed up my radio, the audio coming out of the soundcard into the radio was trashed with a ground-loop hum. Its hard to describe, but those of you who have encountered this problem know exactly what I'm talking about. In the end all I had to do was tie a ground wire to my computer and it cleared right up. Sometimes you can get nasty interference effects when you use radios and computers side by side. Although I didn't refer to it when changing the ground, I recommend  urlLink The ARRL RFI Book.  Its chock full of good how-to tips and directions on troubleshooting interference issues.

      After getting back from my friend's viewing hours, I decided to kick back with a little home entertainment. Being a broke SOB, I'm forced to check out DVD's from the local library. Its really not the hell that it sounds. As long as I'm patient I can get whatever title I want, provided its not too obscure. Or risque. After all, we are talking about public funds.   I mentioned in a previous post that we'd had some serious thunderstorms move through the area. It turns out that it dumped over two inches in the span of an HOUR. That's a lot of rain. The whole yard has basically become a swamp, and the field next to my home sounds like a waterfall. Crazy. I haven't heard any reports of property damage, but there was some serious problems around the county for a few hours after the storm hit.   I'm looking forward to tomorrow. It will be a bit of a respite from what has otherwise proved to be a troubling week. Assuming of course it doesn't rain.

      Written 6/15/2004, 4;20pm  After trying to work in a late morning nap after attending the first  part of the CERT training class, I am rudely interrupted by a double  whammy. My mom continually asks me pointless questions that can't wait  until I acheive full consciousness, AND a nasty thunderstorm moves  through the area dropping over 2 inches of rain. Believe me, a storm  like that makes enough noise to cause concern, even when you aren't  trying to make up for lost sleep.

      I just sat through the first hour of CERT training. It was interesting enough considering it was held at 8am. The best aspect of the training is when a skilled professional adds their input to the basic curriculum. For example, this morning we heard from a local fire chief on the incident command system. He's knowledgeable and prepared to give his perspective based on 27 years of active duty as a firefighter.   I'll visit my late friend at the funeral home this evening. I don't know how to feel about it. I guess I'll find out when I see him.

      I learned this afternoon that a friend of mine had passed away. It wasn't altogether unexpected, but in a way it was. Gee, can I be more vague? I haven't felt really teary eyed about it, but throughout the day I've found myself thinking about things we had done together, or conversations that we'd had. No more of that now.   A mutual friend feels the same way. "I can't help thinking about him," he says, and that's it exactly. I'll miss him. But, given his personal circumstances, I've been missing him for a while.  As for the job quest, I mailed my application for a network technician opening to the local municipal court. I think its a long shot. I got the opening from the local paper, which means that they probably have at LEAST a hundred applicants. All of them with better credentials than I, no doubt.  I sent it anyway, as I can't let my self-defeating mentality get the best of me.  Tomorrow morning (or this morning, as I look at the clock), I'll be attending the first class of  CERT training. For those of you who aren't aware, it stands for Community Emergency Response Team. It was the brainchild of some folks out in L.A.  Its designed to give people a modest background in disaster work and preparedness. Nice to see all those post-9/11 dollars trickling down to the local level. If you're interested in reading more about the program, check out  urlLink EMI's CERT page.

      Two things to comment on. Well, three actually.  Item 1: President Bush stumped in our little town today. It was the same stump speech he gave on Friday in Cleveland. After a stop in Canton, Ohio this morning, he showed up here in Cambridge at about 2:15pm. Things would've been a bit better if we hadn't waited four hours in the rain before he came on. But, why complain? After all, the last time we had a sitting president visit was 1912. Yeesh, that's almost a century ago. Interestingly enough, John Kerry and John Edwards are speaking as I write this in Zanesville, Ohio, about 25 miles to the west. I'm not hearing anything different from the Democrats tonight than I heard at the Democratic Convention last week. I didn't buy into it the first time I heard it.  Item 2: I started ( or re-started ) my old job. I received my first paycheck today, which I promptly blew on pro-Bush propaganda and pornography. Actually, I just bought some stuff I needed from Wal-Mart. I can't stand going in there to buy things, but going to K-Mart just makes me depressed. And speaking of depressed, my old job makes me feel that way. Hopefully I can lose it soon in favor of the Time Warner Cable tech support gig.  Item 3: Read  urlLink http://blamebush.typepad.com . I'm not sure of the author's true political leanings, but I don't care. This blog is funny as hell. Beware though- if you take politics so seriously that you can't laugh at yourself, this site will just make you go through your blood pressure medication quicker.  That is all!

      Today I got a call from Time Warner Cable about the resume I submitted for a technical support position. They want to meet with me tomorrow morning for an interview. OK, this is good. Unfortunately this position would be a 20 minute drive away, which may be too much for my tired old car to handle on a daily basis. If the job looks to be worth it I will find some way to make it happen. This interview gives me hope anyway, even if for whatever reason I don't get the job.  As a radio ham, the events of the sun interest me. It may not be obvious to those outside this hobby but the condition of the sun plays a major role in radio propagation. Recently solar flares have erupted, causing some strange conditions on the radio. Some of these conditions are strange enough to cause aurora as far south as Texas. Here in Ohio we may get some aurora soon. Check  urlLink www.spacew.com  out for an idea of how likely aurora is where you are.

      Two friends and I made a journey yesterday to the big city. Our goal was to introduce a friend to  urlLink Chipotle Mexican Grill . As a fan of Mexican food in general, from my standpoint it was a crime for him to have neglected such a fine restaurant. If you're into burritos, I can think of no better place to eat. Try the hottest sauce they have. You won't regret it.  As a sideline we also hit the radio dealer, or in amateur radio, the  urlLink candy store . We bought a few things but nothing of note. I tried to show one of my friends the joys of synchronous AM, but the HF bands were so bad I couldn't find any station with enough fading to be able to appreciate its quality. Oh well, another trip perhaps. And surely another burrito to go with it.

      I just heard this morning that I'm going back to work for my old employer. Its a meager convenience store clerk position that I had during my college years. I don't really look forward to going, but at this point I really don't have a choice. I've tried just about every other option, including state employment. There's just no opportunity around here. Or if there is, I can't find it.

      I got a nice letter from the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio today telling me I didn't get the job I applied for last month. Oh well. At least they were courteous enough to send me a letter. I would've liked a state job. From what I've heard, the benefits are decent, the atmosphere is somewhat relaxed and its difficult to get fired or laid off. That's a nice combination. Actually, I'm sorry I didn't get the job because I was looking forward to referring to PUCO as "Puke-o". Who needs perks when you work at a place called "Puke-o"?

      I know, I know. You don't want to hear about Gmail anymore. Well, let me recommend a few Gmail utilities, and then I'll shut up about it. If you're like me and have kept all your email since the late 1990's in a Netscape mail box, then you'll want to try either one (or both) of the utilities below.    Mark Lyon has written a gem called  urlLink GML . It reads a Netscape mail file and automatically sends your messages to your new Gmail account. urlLink  gExodus  by Cheah Chu Yeow does essentially the same thing, but was written differently. I found gExodus to be more reliable than GML, but I think that's due to my computer. Both do work, and if you use them be sure to thank the authors for such cool and useful software.

      The job interview for the ad sales gig went well. At least, I think it did. Its always difficult to gauge your own performance in these things. I spoke with the manager and to be honest, she did most of the talking. She was explaining the position and I was eager to hear about it. I hope I didn't come off as too passive.  I suppose the ultimate barometer of sucess in these things is getting the job.   I'm looking forward to this holiday weekend, though I'm not sure why. Outside of a minor get-together here at the homestead I'm not planning on hitting any big shindigs. The most exciting thing I'll do is watch Clay Aiken perform on A Capitol Fourth. The sound will be muted, of course.

      A friend of mine hooked me up with a Gmail account. If you don't know what Gmail is, then you don't really need it. Anyway, I know what it is and I don't need it either. But it is cool as hell, considering you get a mail service with a gigabyte of storage along with the famous Google search. I've already used it to wade through my old mail. Now I can find stuff that I thought I'd either lost or deleted. Incidentally, some of my mail dates back to 1997. No, I do delete stuff. Just not enough. Anyway, if you can get a Gmail account, by all means try it. I'm loving it.  I've got a morning interview tomorrow with someone the local temp agency put me in touch with. The job is selling advertising for a local free tabloid paper. Its part time, probably no benefits and $8 per hour. That's actually a reasonable wage here. I have no idea how it will go, but I'm crossing my fingers. Frankly, I'm happy to be getting an interview.

      A promising job lead has cropped up. At least by my standards its a promising lead. I called the local temp agency and the woman I spoke to thought she might have some work for me. Its a vague, almost non-existent possibility but in my present state I consider that to be a good thing. She'll call me later this morning. I just hope I'm conscious enough to hold a coherent conversation with her.  I ate at  urlLink Chipotles  tonight. My stomach is telling me to run out and get some hi-octane antacid, but I'm resisting. I'd rather tough it out like the clueless masculine dumbass I am. Anyway, its not like I'd be asleep right now anyway. I haven't got to bed before 2am in weeks.   The  urlLink Cassini space probe  has sucessfully entered orbit around Saturn.  Its on a four-year mission to discover little-known obscure scientific trivia about the ringed planet that geeks like me will find cool as hell. Later this year it will jettison its probelet Huygens towards Saturn's moon Titan. Titan is one of the few places besides Earth that may have a shot at harboring life.  The cool thing about Cassini is that it has thousands (if not millions; I'm not sure of the exact number) of signatures that have been digitally scanned onto a DVD and bolted onto the side of the spacecraft. Back in the mid-90's NASA requested that folks sign their name onto a postcard and send it in to have it included. Cool huh? I think I got a few friends and family to sign my card.  Its mind-blowing to realize that my late father's signature is orbit around Saturn at this very moment.

      Well today I spent a miserable 8 hours at the workplace. I was on the maintenance beat, which today also included stocking the new products that came in from our convenience store distributor. Not too bad, but the real problem today was putting up with a co-worker that really REALLY gets on my nerves. I have to work with him again tomorrow and then I won't have to deal with him for the foreseeable future. I can survive one more day I suppose.  My life as it is isn't dangerous enough, so I've begun thinking about riding a motorcycle. I've never ridden one before, but it looks fun. I've ridden a bicycle on some of the rural roads next to my home, and I feel like I could handle a motorcycle of medium stature. I've looked at the Suzuki Savage, the Honda Shadow Aero and of course, Harley Davidsons. The Hondas have a good reputation as being mechanically bulletproof, and since I'm not a gearhead that can easily fix a problem, I'm leaning in their direction. Plus, they seem to be reasonably priced.  Here in Ohio you can take a  urlLink state motorcycle training course  that will serve as your practical, on-cycle test for the permanent license. The classes are all booked up, but I may try to walk-in to a course in Zanesville in October. By then perhaps enough people will forget about it, or will think its too cold to ride in October. Either way, odds are good that I can show up and be included.
