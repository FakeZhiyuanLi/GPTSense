      I had my third driving lesson today and it went pretty well. :) The teacher had to push the pedals couple of times 'coz I didn't do so, but other than that it was fine. Now I have a two-week break and after that I'll drive again, so hopefully I don't forget everything during those two weeks.  I also got those juhannus pictures today and they were ok, although there was one horrible pic of me... Oh well, I don't have to show it to anybody if I don't want to. :P  And btw, I had a really funny dream last night. It was pretty chaotic, but I remember me going to an empty candy shop and sitting in a chair watching Spongebob Squarepants. Suddenly I was at school and everybody had to get out of there fast because there was an angry Spongebob tearing the place up... Go Spongebob, go! :D

      I'm back home and still alive, although I had a terrible hang-over today... But now I'm already starting to feel like a human being again. I drank a bit too much and got bitten by lots of mosquitos. I also fell down some stairs and now I've got two huge bruises in my leg. good thing I was drunk so i didn't feel anything. :p But overall I had a very fun juhannus. :) I just don't feel like drinking again for a while...  I can't wait to see the photos that I took. I remember taking only 7 photos, but when I checked my camera this morning I noticed that I (or some of my friends) have taken 24 pictures... Hopefully there aren't any bad surprises among the pics.

      Tomorrow is juhannus, a Finnish Midsummer festival, and I'm going to celebrate it at my friends summer cottage with ten other people. I just wish I don't drink too much alcohol and wake up lying on a ground and bitten by mosquitos...:P Oh well. And how on earth am I supposed to get myself out of bed at nine o'clock tomorrow? We are leaving at ten, and since it's my summer vacation I'm used to sleeping till 2 PM... I have to set at least three alarms... *sigh* Well, this wasn't very rational, but I guess writing here in English encourages me to use this language more. And at least writing helps me to clear my thoughts a bit. So it doesn't really matter if anyone reads these or not. :P

      Hi, I found this blog thing while surfing in the net, and I just thought I could try this out... So, I'm a girl from Finland (don't mind about the spelling or grammar mistakes, my English isn't perfect :p) and I'm gonna have to get used to this whole blog thing 'coz I'm not quite sure how it works... But I'll try to figure that out and write something rational next time! :)

      ...drinking again for change! Now you're just gonna think that I have no life, that I'm just drinking all the time, but really, there's nothing else to write about. It's my summer vacation now (it's actually the last week of it, then I have one course in this summer high school thing and after that the "real" school starts...) and everything worth writing involves drinking. :P  We were in a bar again and it was a fun night, even tho I'm already home at 1.30 AM. But I'm actually still drunk when writing this! Oh, who cares... :P  A friend of mine turned 18 couple of days ago, and in Finland that means you can buy alcohol and get into most bars. My birhtday is unfortunately in September. Most of my friends are already 18 years of age and they have nothing to worry about if the porter askes to see your IDs... I just have to explain I forgot my IDs at home or something. Well, good thing that they don't ask to see those in every bar. :)

      Wow, last weekend was one of the funniest weekends ever! :) Ilosaarirock festival was great; the weather was amazing, the bands were good and the company was funny. It was the same group of friends (with couple of exceptions) than in that summer cottage at juhannus. We spent those two festival days drinking, listening to good (live) music and enjoying the sunny and warm weather along with other 20 000 festival guests. Again, I can't wait to see the pictures I took!  I spent all of my money there, the food was a bit more pricey that I thought. It was good tho, there were lots of different kinds of food booths (Chinese, Vietnamiese, vegetarian food, hamburgers etc). And of course the drinks cost some money too. :P

      It really pisses me off to have no accurate plans. I'm not a very impulsive person... Ilosaarirock festival is this weekend and I still don't know how and when am I going to get there. My two friends don't know if they're going there tomorrow or on Saturday, and they don't know if they're going by bus or by their own car. I really wouldn't want to go by myself, coz it's a two-hour drive and it's just boring without any company. So i wish they would just make up their minds already and inform me as well so I could take a same ride as they do! :/  Another things that piss me off: that I just can't get any sleep even tho it's almost 3 am, that it's just impossible for me to get myself out of bed before 11 am, and that my latest driving lesson didn't go very well (apparently I drive too fast :P).   One happy thing, tho: I visited a friend of mine today that I haven't seen in ages. She had the cutest little puppy! He was so tiny, black, happy and way too adorable. :) Too bad I didn't have my camera with me.

      Whoa, I was drinking again yesterday. Not that much though, just enough to get all dizzy and happy. :) Me and two friends of mine went to a couple of bars (even though I'm only 17 and in Finland you have to be at least 18 before you can get into any bars) and we had a good time.   Tomorrow I'm leaving for another city to visit my relatives and it's going to be pretty boring. I don't have any friends there and I won't be able to use the Internet so often. There are no good programs on TV at summer and the weather is not so good so I can't even go to a beach. Meh.  But two weeks... and then: Ilosaarirock festival! Another great reason to get drunk. :P

      The summer school thing started yesterday and I'm really not that interested about school, it's still summer for crying out loud! It's been raining almost all the time for the past week but yesterday the weather got really warm and sunny. And I'm stuck at school. (To be honest, it lasts only 1 and a half hour per day, so it shouldn't be too bad but it's still school! Plus the homework.) :(  But driving lesson today went really smoothly, I'm finally getting the idea. And my friend turns 18 on Friday, we're having a party! ;) (And I'm not gonna mention that I was out "celebrating" last Saturday as well...) But summer is almost over, I have to party when I have time to do that! :P
