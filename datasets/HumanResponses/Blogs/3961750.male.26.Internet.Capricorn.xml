        Defining the purpose of life, the submission    21 Spelling without spelling, The submission, life and its seeking, The life of only worship and prayer, The total submission To the source and course of spontaneity, God, The stillness and the flow, To Take you out of all confinements, and Get you back your mirror nature unveiled.  22 Submission. A rebellion in silence Against the life’s cycle and its perils. That which is not an act Can never be defined too.  23 Submission. Your seeking. Seeking in the way of making. The making that which may unmake you To give you the meaning of meaninglessness  24 Submission. Your praying in the way of perspiring. Your becoming in the way of evolving. Submission is your own seeking and selecting The evolution beyond all evolutions.  25 Submission. Your approaching and embracing God To seek your identity, but to miss it on the way To make the hollowness, the backbone behind.  26 Submission. Your watching and viewing of God With no face to any direction special Squatting on the space and floor of no space and door.  27 Submission. You were all set to conquer, But became yourself a bead lost. Now, the owner finds you back And leads you to the rosary in his hand.  28 Submission. Nothing, but Lion’s Preaching of non-violence, Never with tone and tongue of Helpless sheep and Goat, But with that of pure enlightenment.  29 Submission. Your easy going out Of the nucleus and orbit To declare the freedom As the only solution from God.  30 Submission. You are fusing and merging God and devil together in you To weigh and finally tie Only the one for you.  31 Submission. Here, fire is not the painted one But is that which can cook The whole world and everything in it For and before you  32 Submission. Thing told becomes here the untold, Whereas, unheard things become The told and familiar to get you assured This to be the secret behind the true submission.  33 Submission. The way of seeking your identity But losing in the way of proving To replace the same with the one Whom you can’t know with your reason.  34 Submission. You thought, you were in here And are because of here. Now, let the fact be that the whole world Is in you and is because of you.  35 Submission. Your making love with truth The result gets you and the truth Lost and missing To let the orgasm only remain.  36 Submission. You never have to look and search, But, only see and collect. You never have to try and exert But get showered ever with the blessings.  37 Submission. The thirsty one Begs for the Water. Digs in himself. (thasneem) Submission is the self-reliance and seeking within.  38 Submission. You are watching the magic. The price and cost paid on the street Is your curiosity about the Magician, The mere submission of losing yourself.  39 Submission. Finally to be with a love mate (hoor) Whose love and refuge is So unconditional Filled with novelties.  40 Submission. The sheep shall graze in On its own, And for its own. No, permission, no prohibition.  41 Submission. To escape from the tongues That may lick you to kill And lick only in the way of killing To kill the spontaneity and its course.  42 Submission. As a gardener, before You made the fences and walls But as a Shepherd, now You let them graze in.   43 Submission. Only a mat On which you may lay and rest Unto the infinity Seeking the infinity  44 Submission. No Servant, no master. Here you are both, And you will become no one too. Not even a dot.  45 Submission. To define the freedom As your tongue and path, The practice and finally To get in harmony with all Truly through your submission.  46 Submission. Here, you happen to chant That the birth never gives start And death never puts an end And it is the submission That gives you the continuity of permanence  47 Submission. Your watching yourself And becoming like a thief, but pious, To enter in to the heaven. Never being watched. Never being caught.  48 Submission. Your becoming altogether A blank paper, The pen writing on it And writer and his message, The message of peace  49 Submission. More than becoming a flame Once you happened to be a claim And not even a claim Which can put out the flame.   50 Submission. As for the whole world You are now asleep Whereas you are awake In God, with God.  51 Submission. Here, in submission You get frozen To be none And get melting To be none.  52 Submission. Here, you become merely a dust, Also, a Mountain. A Drop, Also, an Ocean  53 Submission. Here, God is the one With no threats and commands And devil is the one Only with commands and threats.  54 Submission. God, in your submission, needs No proofs and evidences And support of your beliefs. You are flying to his heights Losing your weight and wings.  55 Submission. Might be in the plain of ignorance, You were active But were only a log Or a piece of wood in the rust.  56 Submission. Might be in the plain of thoughts and scholarship, You were a log, But burning Without the flame and its light.  57 Submission. But in your plain of enlightenment, the submission, When you meet with God and its passivity You shall become only the flame With no claim and its burden.  58 Submission. Setting is your rising. Rising is your upbringing. East and west are nowhere else, But, the courses you undergo.  59 Submission. Herein, you happen to say God is equal to no-god Black is equal to white And you are equal to novelty And novel play of God.  60 Submission. You are spreading your wings From the state of Time and space To the beyondness of No-space and no-time.  61 Submission. From here, you shall withdraw yourself To the light of darkness To see only the holes of light in darkness And to supply the light from dark-holes  62 Submission Your flying into the heights And falling into the depths Without making any sense of difference Other than that of novelty and truth.  63 Submission. As a dewdrop on petals Herein you become open to the sun To be evaporated And be one with heaven.  64 Submission. Here a balloon is aired Not to make it a balloon Also a balloon is aired out Not to make it a balloon.  65 Submission. Novelty made as the path Purposelessness as the aim And the spontaneity to be the course therein To get lost the repetition as the result.  66 Submission. Meeting yourself as a stranger, Getting you acquainted to yourself, To make you a good friend your own A stranger’s becoming of stranger’s friend.  67 Submission. The prayers of submission Gets the truth inhibited in a seed Exhibited and exposed on the trees and plants As fruits and flowers as its result.  68 Submission. Revealing and declaring Nobody as the sole agent of truth And giving all equal access of God To bring the truth as their part and parcel.  69 Submission. Hereby you are made as The means and instrument For the truth to get discharged And be spelled out through you.  70 Submission. Death is meant to be the growth And life as a continuation Given by the death.  71 Submission. The humility of submission leads you to be The breeze and the message in its whistling, Also you become thereby the wind To clear out all the clouds over the sky.  72 Submission. With your will, in its course of submission, You will send down the roots, Grind any rocks And shall send up the branches And reach and rest in any height.  73 Submission. Whereby you are entering into the flames To be burnt like a fly To let the flame only remain And make you to be that flame.  74 Submission. It is your going out of all Tracks and definitions of senses And becoming yourself The only track and definition to God.  75 Submission. A seed shall be hereby Made to be not a seed But a tree With thousands of seeds on it.  76 Submission. It is your watering of the tree  With the sweat and tears your own Not to mix up evil with good Making no sense of both.  77 Submission. Gets you evaporated Like the water in oceans To send you back again down As the rain of growth and prosperity  78 Submission. It is your becoming the point of meeting Of heaven and earth Linking both, and getting them to be One and the same in your eyes.  79 Submission. Freedom from all pretension So as to deny anything you feel Making it a claim that God and truth As the state before and after any denial and belief.    80 Submission. Seeking and selecting A kingdom of a King, the Almighty, So as to make you a subject only to him.  81 Submission. It is your hunting, Your hunting of only the truth. The dogs and bows sent are The “I” feeling yours.  82 Submission. Herein you converse with God In the way of reflecting God In you as you are a mirror And getting you reflected in God As God is a mirror for you.  83 Submission. Your complaining against yourself And giving testimony as a witness too Brought yourself before the judge To be convicted or acquitted as the case may be.  84 Submission. You were insignificant an item But when you evolve and become Beyond all evolution to reach God All the worlds become insignificant Like the sweat and smell of your body  85 Submission. Your becoming unknown As a trick to reach and be known To the one whom you do not know But, who knows you and every thing  86 Submission. Here you become a murderer To kill you at your own hand And you are running to reach the one To get you reborn to the infinity.  87 Submission. You were only an egg Now in submission You  start to brood over yourself To get hatched up and reach God To go beyond all the forms of this universality.  88 Submission. Your becoming a big tree than a balloon Against the sun to spread the shade, To give nest and fruits to all and all Making that your submission and sacrifice.  89 Submission. The whole universe was for you Like a mirror shattered Now you are gathering the pieces together To set them right and intact again.  90 Submission. Core becomes here the cover And Light becomes here your core Ever kept untouched by submission You reach the state in which you were.  91 Submission. The whole secret of truth is for you the one The one your core Whatever the way you may live in submission The submission is the state in which you have to be.  92 Submission. No need of evidences here for you To prove and identify yourself With any worldly things and engagements Other than with the submission and God.  93 Submission. Not your helplessness. Also not it is your cowardice. It is your wish and will to be the one With the course and the flow of the whole and all.  94 Submission. Chaos and turbulence Silence and stillness But while in submission Emptied a bottle like You get lost of its bottom too  95 Submission. You become like the wind To clear all the clouds of miseries And become like the clouds To cause the rain on the earth.  96 Submission. It is your dancing To dissolve yourself Into the truth and God And to remain not even As God and Truth.  97 Submission. Viewing God as your only purpose And becoming yourself purposeless a fool. Get lost herein of all scales and criteria Including man, money and its mechanism.  98 Submission. Death and birth becomes Just God’s breathing in and out. The air breathed in and out is God’s And space and time used for also are God’s.

      1 Do confess it That no color can depict it And no eye can endorse it Such is its form and format That it frustrates you of all your senses  Do confess it That the oceans are helpless to afford And the skies are insufficient to contain Such is its heights and depths That it makes all your scales fake and worn out  2 Flow and flame Are ever the same, With no change in themselves Cause everything change.  3 Impulses and its compulsions Even the bodies beautiful, the fruits and flowers, Get ripe and rotten in its heat and pressure And the hair black gets ash like gray.  4 Truth is such Its sound and silence is such Anything can move up and down It is so bewitching that unmakes you to be unknown  5 Truth being one with God Your neck and nerve is filled with it The path to god is ever open and broad Like the path to the mother's milking breast  6 The cost you may pay here Is the cost so unique and different The God and truth take from you The self so precious your own.  7 God! The roof and the base The sight and the scene Is he not the one like ever watching, But, never being watched and caught?  8 God! The breath and the breast The might and the fight Is he not like the petal of a flower To permit all the flies equally in?  9 God! The sound and the silence The right and the wrong Never desperate and never helpless he is In waiting for more and more visitors?  10 True, God meditates on himself In the way of creating and sustaining Destroying and getting only his face remaining Making everything to be his simple trick and play  11 See the soil and seed Simply surrendering  to each other Plants and trees become the results Such is the magic of submission.  12 See the soil and plant Submitting to each other Fruits and flowers become the result To make the same its preaching, (that the truth is The color and taste hidden beneath the soil)  13 Truth, like soil, and myself being A drop of the merciful, a seed of God, Striving for a life to sprout and grow Ask hereby for those perplexed around me  14 A question, answer to which could be The life blood to this life, The reason by which God is God And that which may empty and fill any cup as well  15 God! As I suppose my being as the way to pursue The sprouting and growth of the seed in me, To surrender and be no more as a seed And be one among those meeting this your cause    16 God! Here, as a seed or drop face to face with you I consider you as my own stuff and crux, My own meaning and inner self, And I ask you, God, as I ask myself  17 To make the respiration and perspiration mine The lessons and teachings of pure guidance About the submission of this your child To define and explain what this submission is?  18 God! Beggars on the streets have touched me With the answer that could satisfy me to my fill Though the priests and scholars were helpless to spell That the surrendering is not mere practice and prayers.  19 God! Myself being a seed or a letter In your name and being, that is forever, Ask you to give this my “submission” a meaning To enable me to sleep on lap of such meaning  20 God! Myself being only a fish In an ocean that is you, the limitless, The blood and breathe in me, please,Disclose to me what and how this submission is?
