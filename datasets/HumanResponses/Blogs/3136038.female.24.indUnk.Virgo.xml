						   I have been at work since 7 this morning.  I got up at 6 this morning.  I went to bed at 11 last night.  I am pooped, and its a long day.  And, no word from TD since Wednesday (feeling a little insecure about that).    I had some good girl time with Renada last night... I went up to her house to help her with a school project.  It was fun!  We spraypainted some stuff, went on the regular Thursday night Walmart run, chatted a lot.    I have to work tonight.  Yuck!  I want to do something fun... such as:  renting a movie or two and lounging on the couch all night.  Something laid back, low key.  This next week is going to be busy as well, and I am tired and need to catch up on sleeping.

						   Ok, so I pour my heart and soul out on this thing, and people read it (at least 117 people so far), but only my good friends William and Ryan comment and give me advice.  Get to it!    So I had a long chat with my sister last night.  She told me about her project (very cool), and told me about this guy that she has been seeing.  Kinda freaked me out a little bit actually, cause the guy is a really old friend, and they have done some things that I am not too sure about.  Apparently, she spent the night at his house a while ago, which isn't a big deal, but he slept in the same bed as she did, and they woke up in the middle of the night, and he kissed her.  Ok, sleeping in the same bed... pretty dangerous.  Kissing in bed in the middle of the night... really dangerous.  This is my sister, and she has stood back and watched as I made some pretty serious mistakes, and I really am a strong believer in letting people make their own mistakes, because that is how you learn, but I don't want to sit back and watch as she makes ANY!  But such is life.   Her name--mellifluous and beguiling, as befits a creature of her tremendous delicacy and charm--was Phoebe B. Beebee  -- Cecil Adams, as quoted from The Straight Dope  I have decided that I would like to be referred to as mellifluous (pleasing to the ear) and beguiling (highly attractive and able to arouse hope or desire) with tremendous delicacy (lightness in movement or manner  or the quality of being beautiful and delicate in appearance) and charm (attractiveness that interests or pleases or stimulates).  It is too bad that my beloved Cecil was referring to a chimpanzee.

						   After work, I went home and made myself a tuna sandwich (was craving it all day).  Then I changed to go to the temple, and sat down to wait for Lisa and Dan to show up.  Dan was right on time (as usual), so we sat and chatted while we waited for Lisa.  Fong time came and went, and no Lisa, so we decided to just go on to the temple (Melanie was home, so she could show her around).  She never did come, by the way, but she did email me this morning with an apology and a reschedule.  When Dan and I were checking in at the front desk of the temple, the elder there asked us if we wanted to do sealings.  Sure, why not?  Whoa.  Intense.    I didn't feel nervous at all until I felt Dan shaking... then I am like "what are we doing? this is crazy."  (Melanie said later that maybe he realized that he loves you while you were kneeling there... um, shut up)  So after the sealings, we went up the the CR for a while to chat... then we went home, I made him dinner (grilled cheese), then we sat on the couch and chatted some more... there was some snuggling as well.  *here's the good part*  When he got up to leave, he pulled me in (presumably for a hug) and laid one on me.  Wow. I was still absorbing that one when he came back for #2.  I about fell over I was so shocked.  Where did that awkward guy go that I saw just the other day?  Where did that shaky guy go that I held hands with about an hour ago?  Where  did   that come from?    It was good.  I can't wait to see him again.

						   Momentary rant:  I love this blogging thing.  I get things off of my chest, I have something interesting and productive to do during the day, and I am journalling.  Its the greatest.  I have never been able to keep a written journal for very long, and this is so much better because I can get things out while they are fresh in my mind, and jump from one thought to the next, and go back and edit, etc.  Love it.  A girl named Lisa is coming by tonight to look at my house to possibly move in.  She seems very nice, and her brother-in-law is a firefighter (with cute firefighter friends I am sure).  Hee hee... you see what my motives are.  Actually in my defense, I agree wholeheartedly with  urlLink this article  on what girls are attracted to.  I wouldn't say scrawny necessarily, but I definitely don't want anyone ultra muscley.  Those guys are only good to look at.  I always kindof like the  urlLink Fred Flintstone  type anyway.  Maybe its how he calls to Wilma when he gets home from work, or maybe its the dress that he likes to wear... I dunno.  You know what other character I always had a crush on?   urlLink Kermit .  No explanation necessary.  So the plan for tonight is to meet Lisa, show her around the place, then meet TDan (maybe?? I didn't hear a peep from him yesterday) and go to the temple for my regular Wednesday night session. I might even feed him some dinner.  I am also thinking about hanging out with my sister a little bit tonight (if either of us has the time), as she has a major exhibit at the local  urlLink Home and Garden Show  this weekend.  Go Liss!!  I know you will win the competition.   I am feeling very insecure today.  I can't put the thoughts into words... Satan is working pretty hard on me lately.  He has his largest tempters working me.  I am determined to overcome them.  I am stronger than they are.

						   Finally, a fairly uneventful evening! I sat home last night and watched Navy NCIS, the Guardian, and Judging Amy.  Then I went to bed.  It was fun.  I can really relate with Amy's insecurity.  No word from TD, or anyone else for that matter.  I did have an interview for a class that I want to take through the city that I live in.  I interviewed with the Mayor and another lady.  I think it went well... I hope I get into the class.  I am suprised that all of these boys don't know what the hand on face hug is.  (I havent had any feedback from girls on that subject)  I think they just aren't paying attention.  I would certainly notice if a dude put his hand on my face when we were hugging, but it would be weird if a guy busted out with that move... its generally a girl move, unless a kiss is involved.

						   I received a question or two about this:  The hand on face hug is where the hugee (girl) puts one hand behind the back of the hugger(guy) like a normal hug, but the other hand goes on the face or neck of the hugger... and this usually works the best when you are cheek to cheek.  This style of hug doesn't work very well when the dude is taller, unless when one or both is sitting.  I now have comments!  Please feel free to comment with abandon!

						   Last night, I went home, chilled for a little while, then headed on over to FHE.  The plan was to play frisbee golf then play volleyball.  I was a lot tired when I got there, so I decided to skip both and just chat with my friends for a little while, hit the grocery store, then go home and go to bed.  (fyi, this is the LOOOONG version)  When I got there, there weren't many people there yet, so I sat down in the grass outside and let people come to me.  (Not the most social of behaviors, but I was pooped!).  Soon enough, Faith and her beautiful baby came over and we talked for a bit while I played with the baby.  TD came and sat down nearby and played with the baby a bit (attractive!  A man that is good with kids).    After a while, FHE got started (still outside) and I stayed talking to Faith while everyone else went to play Frisbee.  I watched the baby and chatted with people that were standing around.  When it was too dark to play frisbee anymore, the cookies came out (typical).  TDan came up and we talked for a second (I don't even remember what about), then I went and sat down.  I started chatting with a couple of people, and TDan came down and sat next to me.  Soon, Ruth sat down next to him and they started talking in spanish... swapping mission stories.    As everyone got up to leave a little later, TD stood around next to me like he had something to say, so I asked him if he wanted to go to the grocery store with me.  We chatted superficially on the way, and during shopping.  *here's the good part*  On the way home, TD brings up the fact that Melanie's Dan has been giving him weird looks.  (he has, I noticed it as well).  I told him about Shawn's trying to get the dirt out of me (see the recap of Sunday)... he was a little embarrassed about this, but I told him no big deal.  So then he asked me "So, just so I am in the loop, we are dating, right?"  Stop the bus.  What???  Ok, what is TD's definition of dating??  Cause in my book, we aren't exclusive, not by any means.  What is it with the boy wanting to move too fast?  I am still just checking things out.    So, because his question took me by complete suprise (wasn't expecting a DTR after one week), I blurted out "sure..."  and then, I made my fatal mistake.  We were still in the car, he was getting ready to get out, he leaned in for one of his awkward hugs, and I gave him the infamous hand on face hug, and I left the hand there just a half a second longer than he let go.  What was I thinking???  This only confuses the issue more.    I do like the guy, and I find him very attractive.  And he really is what I would like in a guy: strong in the gospel, does what he says he is going to do, is honest, kind, caring, smart, etc... but... i don't know what my problem is.  A very large part of me thinks that Satan is working really hard on my insecurities and is trying to prevent this... and the other part of me thinks that its all me.  And... is he really interested in me, or is he only sticking around because I let him know that I was interested?

						   So LB was asking me about TD this morning.  I told him that TD works for the university, and LB said "where, in the tool shed??"  Implying that TD is a tool.  (tool = negative, dork, socially inept, etc).  Ok, maybe TD is a little bit of a tool, but I like tools, ok?    Little bit about TD - 22, RM (Missouri), BS in Electrical Engineering (EE), working on MS in EE.  Lives with 2 other guys in an apartment.

						   It was an eventful weekend... I will start at the beginning  Friday evening:  I went home, semi-prepared to cuddle up with the physics, but Melanie and Dan were going to the temple, so I decided to join them.  (anything to put off working on physics) I had given Tutor Dan all of my male names to do the beginning temple work on, so I called him to see if he had done them.  When I found that he had not, I just invited him to go with us to a session at the temple.  I had forgotten that Friday night at the temple is date night... so I felt a little weird about that, but it worked out well.  After the session, as we walked back to the dressing rooms, I said "hey, I dont know if Dan and Melanie are planning on doing anything, but do you want to meet in the lobby and go with us if we do?'... so we did.  Melanie and Dan didn't want to do anything else, so as we were walking out, TD asked me if I wanted to go do something.  Well, sure.  It was late, so we went to Denny's.  We sat in the booth chatting for almost 2 hours.  The man is very attractive, even if he is a little on the dorky side.  He is also very intense.  When we got to the door, I said something to the effect of "gimme a hug"... oh goodness.  he is AWKWARD!  He was so nervous... and not a little sweaty.  He must not have much girl experience.  At this point... I am feeling pretty good about TD.    Saturday morning... Slept in a little bit.  Had to work for a few hours, nothing too taxing.  I then went to take Melanie and Dan's engagement photos.  That was suprisingly fun!  I laughed a lot... mostly because Dan is a huge dork and he can't smile on command.  Melanie wanted formal pictures... Dan wore a suit, Melanie a skirt.  I asked her if she was sure that she wanted formal pictures taken because her wedding photos will be formal.  Wow, I shouldn't have said anything.  She almost bit my head off... she was positive that she wanted formal pictures.  The good part of this experience is that I know better what I am going and what I am not going to do for my wedding.  Saturday evening - Dancing!  I was hot.  I was on fire.  I was a guy magnet.  I didn't sit out even one dance.  It was great!  I danced several times with Josh... (the scoop on Josh:  I have been interested in him for a while, but he was getting married to a girl from Utah, so he was obviously off limits.  But recently, his fiancee called the whole thing off.  So he has been going to the Saturday night dances, and he is a great dancer.  I mentioned to Renada on the way to the dance that its too bad that his breakup is so recent, because I would like to put the moves on him (and then we laughed).)  So while we were dancing, we chatted quite a bit, and he mentioned that he read my profile, and that we have quite a bit in common.  Yee haw!  I invited him to dinner on Sunday night, but he already had plans.  Bummer!  So, back to dancing.  There is a guy in my ward named Doug.  The man is in his 30s, is about a foot shorter than me, and has the body shape of a bowling ball on toothpicks.  I do not consider myself shallow, but I do need to be at least slightly attracted to a guy in order to be interested.  Not at all interested in Doug, but I think that he thinks that there might be a chance, so he really lays it on thick.  Tells me how beautiful I am, what a great dancer, nice... etc.  I dont know what to do with him.  I don't want to hurt his feelings, but I also dont want him to think that he is ok to move on me.    Sunday, I finally got up early enough to go to choir.  I haven't gone in a few weeks, and I forgot how nice it is to partake of the spirit for an hour more on Sunday.  Church was great... the spirit was strong, the talks were good, the lessons inspired.  I was a tad rude to Tutor Dan... not on purpose, but I feel awkward around him... I think because he feels so awkward around me.  TD's roomate, Shawn, came up and talked to me a little bit, trying to bring up TD as much as possible. I think he was trying to get some dirt out of me on Dan, my feeeeelings and such.  I didn't spill anything... on purpose.  His motive was so obvious!  It was hilarious.  I called Josh after church (since I didn't see him there) to see if he wanted to come to dinner.  Renada met a guy at the dance on Saturday that she wanted to invite over, but she didnt want to be the only one with a date.  As I said before, Josh had other plans, so I decided to call Dan.  Unfortunately, I lost Dan's number (deleted it off of the answering machine), so I had to call Shawn to have Dan call me.  I left a message on Shawn's voicemail, and it took a maximum of 4 minutes for Dan to call me back.  He had some home teaching appointments, but he came over in between.  We also had Darla (one of my favorite girlfriends), Cambria (another) and Cambria's brother, Brian.  It was a nice, relaxing evening around friends.  Renada's guy didn't show up, and he called her back to tell her that he had to study.  Fairly decent excuse.  As Dan was leaving after dinner, he asked me about physics: if I needed more help.  I did, in fact, so he came back after his Home Teaching appointment (around 8).  I have to admit that we didnt work on much physics... just a couple of minutes.  We sat and chatted again until almost midnight.  He is good to talk to, but we really just talk about superficial things... of course, its only been a few days though.  (I was informed that there is a difference between a geek and a dork when I said 'oh, a dork by engineer standards?' after TD called someone a dork.  Geek = positive connotation, Dork = negative connotation.  I stand corrected.)  Another hug at the door... only slightly less awkward (on his part... I dont feel awkward about hugs at all), and lasting about 1/10th of a second.  We are going to the temple on Wednesday... soo.... who knows.    You know what this girl has been pining for?  A kiss.  A really good one with someone that I am really interested in.  It has been sooo long!!  And if I can't have a really good kiss, I would settle for a passionate hug... you know the kind.  The one where you are like, wow, that was a great hug, I really like this guy!  Yeah, not going to happen for me for a while.

						   So basically, I have a bad attitude towards some things lately.  I avoid going home, because that would mean that I have to spend time with the roomate, and the roomate's financee... and let me tell you how fun being the third wheel is, um, not.  So Saturday evening, I get to take the pictures of the happy couple for their invites.  fun.

						   So I am sitting in physics, trying really hard to concentrate, and this bunch of freshman start goofing off.  Normally, I ignore them, but today it was out of hand.  I almost interruped the class to tell them to sit down and shut up.  I sound like an old lady (Rose?), but really people need to respect the rights of others to learn.  This class is freakin hard, and I want to pass, and there are those punks who goof off, cheat on the test, and do better than me.  Its annoying.  You know when you walk into a public (or, for that matter, private) bathroom, and its like: whoa there honey, what did you eat?  I am always so paranoid that someone will think that it is me when i walk out.  To quote Oprah, "Girl, that was not me... its that girl grunting in the first stall."    Speaking of questionable stuff, at the temple last night, I was in the company of two older ladies, and I sat down on this plasticy-faux leather seat, and it made a  terrible  noise.  I was so embarrassed!!!  It was not appropriate of me to say "that wasnt me!!" or laugh, but i felt the need to do both.  I could hardly contain myself, it was so funny.  Its funny too how much funnier something is when you try not to laugh.

						   I eat two york peppermint patties almost every day.  I know it's evil, and I know that these lovely little patties travel directly to my thighs, but I love them dearly.  How can something so simple be so delicious?  And how can something so delicious be a "low fat food?"    I dont think I have ever used the word delicious before.  I certainly haven't ever typed it.    Whoa... I am in a strange mood.    I think Dan W. thinks that I am hitting on him... and maybe I am.  He is attractive, very sweet, and a great tutor, but he is very hard to read.  And I am not sure whether or not I am interested.  It actually feels weird to even think about being interested in someone... it has been so long.  I feel rather inept at the whole business.  Sure, I have my little "oh, he is cute" moments, but they never last long.  And I have even been known to flirt on occasion, but it never goes anywhere.  So Dan came over to my house on Tuesday, helped me with physics, then I fed him dinner.  I asked him Tuesday if he wanted to go to the temple with me and a group of friends on wednesday... and he said he would be there, and he was.  He also doing me another favor...   Ok, I just had an epiphany.  Let it go.  No need to worry.  I think what I am most worried about is what other people think.  Really, what difference does it make?  If nothing happens, nothing happens.  If something does, then great.  Physics, yuck.  I am now off to an hour and a half of note taking and trying not to sleep.

						   but instead, I stuffed a couple of envelopes and called it a day.  I am now sitting here surfing the web... where I found a slightly crass yet hilariously funny website.  (It is hard evidence that I am anal retentive... and not just in the nitpicky, everything's gotta be perfect kind of way)  John Hargrave is a funny man... he is the guy who made the movie about eating nothing but McDonalds for 30 days.  Anyway, feast upon his  urlLink funnys .  Beware though, it has a bit of language (nothing too raunchy though), read at your own peril.  (I for one pretty much assured myself a luxury suite in the lower depths when I made that boy cry in 7th grade) ;)  I failed to mention  urlLink Ryan  earlier.  He posted a plug for this humble little blog on his site the other day, and paid me a very sweet compliment.  Love ya, Ryan.  I enjoy reading what you write as well!

						   So I am walking down one of the malls at school/work, minding my own business, and some freshman punk blows his secondhand smoke right in my face as he walks by.  That is disgusting!  I held my breath for the next 50 yards, but I still got a lungfull.  Seriously people, if you have to burn it to put it in your body, why would you??  Today has been such a lazy day!  I have been working on bridal shower stuff, and I actually went to math today... I am trying to keep my absenteeism down to once a week.  ;)  What I should be doing is physics while it is fresh in my mind.  Dan W. came by last night to help me with it.  He is a great instructor!  Quite a bit better than the instructor that is paid to teach me this stuff.  I am still not sure if I am going to pass... but oh well at this point.  My dad called me last night and asked if I would like to join him on a trip to Sacramento in the middle of May.  Yee haw!  I love Sacramento (there is this greasy burger stand that we always go to... yum!).  The only bummer is that we are cleaning out my grandma and Jim's house. Since Jim passed away, my uncle is going to rent the place out.  There was a time that I considered moving up there, but now I have this great job, so that idea is put aside for a few more years... maybe I will go after I finish school. The fun part of this trip will be family history!  I have become so addicted to doing family history/geneology work, and I know that there are tons of pictures and letters that I can use in the house.  Speaking of family history, I am excited to go to my newest hangout, the family history center, tonight.  I am going to do some work, and then I am meeting some friends to do a session.  I can't wait!  I got a wild hair last night and decided to clean out some file drawers and my picture drawer in my desk.  I threw away so much crap... but that isnt the point.  I sorted out my pictures.. I have a HUGE pile of pictures of Emma and various other pets, a smaller pile of family, a weenie little pile of friends, and like 4 pictures of just me.  I gotta get out more with the camera!    Speaking of friends... I never want to be anyone's maid of honor ever again.  Its a bum rap.  I get to pay for a bunch of crap, compile a list of people I don't know, talk to these people on the phone, mail them stuff, then hang out with them on a precious free Saturday?  I think this sounds like a job for an enemy.  When (If??) I get married, I am going to have the list ready for my poor, unwitting, victim of honor... including addresses.  I haven't even been included in any of the fun stuff.  (Dress picking, etc.)  Work beckons...

						   I was just compared to  urlLink Rose Nyland  from  urlLink The Golden Girls .  ouch.  Ok, I admit that my stories sometimes are long and drawn out and have no point.  I also admit to having Norwegian ancestors who resided in MN.  And it is clear that I am blonde with blue eyes.    Ok, it's a valid comparison.  Except that I am not old.  My two favorite stories of late:  1) Jake, my friend who is a cop, once had a prisoner in the back seat of his squad car.  The prisoner was extremely talkative, and was quite annoying.  Jake farted, audibly.  The prisoner stopped talking and then said "What was that?"  Jake said, "I farted."  The prisoner was quiet after that.    2) Shawn, another friend and one of my Home Teachers, was taking the garbage out one day, and as he bent down to get the bag out of the can, he went a little too low, and a knife from the open diswasher stuck into his rear end.  His mom had to help him get it out.  Of course, I can make these stories last for much longer than 3 lines each, but it's better to hear them told than to read them.  I have been thinking that i should take a creative writing class... but who has time?  Some cause happiness wherever they go; others, whenever they go.  -- Oscar Wilde

						   My weekends are the funnest!!  I haven't had a weekend that wasn't a blast for a very long time.  This weekend was no different.  Friday evening, Renada, Cambria, Jake and I went to a free movie in Tempe's Kiwanis park.  We saw "Holes" while sitting on a blanket.  C and I went to the grocery store prior to going to the park and picked up sandwich fixings and some fruit, and we sat on a blanket in the park and made our own sandwiches.  It was really fun.  I think I am going to be a regular at that event.  After that movie was done, we went to the video store and rented "the Importance of Being Ernest," one of my favorite movies.  I didn't last through the entire movie, but I have seen it before.    Saturday morning, Cambria and I got up early and went to the 8am session at the temple.  I have never seen the temple so beautiful before.  The weather was cool... and the way the sun was positioned was just gorgeous!  The way the light in the Celestial room was shining through the windows was awesome.  It felt so great to get up and participate in something so spiritual so early in the morning.  After the session, Cambria and I went to breakfast at The Egg and I.  We had some great conversation... and we talked about some trips that we are thinking of taking this summer... about one a month!  April we went to Peppersauce Caves, May we are going tubing on the Salt River, June we are taking a road trip up to Salt Lake on a Friday evening, then we are going to go do all the Salt Lake tourist things... a session at the temple, the Joseph Smith Building, Testaments, etc., July we may go to Austin and San Antonio for a few days.  August, my family is going sailing around the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington.  This summer is going to be so fun!!  After breakfast, I went home and took a nap, then Derek, Renada and I went to the Maricopa County Fair with some other friends.  We walked around, looking at the exibits and the animals, then we rode a few rides.  There is some prime people watching at the fair.  I saw a 12 or 13 year old kid that had a mohawk, which shocked me.   That begged the question:  If I had a young teenager, would I let them have a mohawk or something else extreme?  I think the answer for me is yes.  If you don't let  your kids do something to their hair (hair is just that, hair.  Its temporary, its easy to change, no big deal), then what are they going to do to assert their independance?  I think as long as my children are safe, not doing drugs, wearing clothes that cover what they need to cover, and not 'getting it on,'  then they can make their own decisions (within reason... they aren't going to run rampant, but they need to have some independance and agency).  After we got home from the fair, we went country dancing.  That was so much fun!  All of my favorite girls and most of my favorite boys were there.  I love to dance!  Sunday was a good day as well... after church, we had a series of appointments, Visiting Teachers, then Home Teachers, then Renada and I went to the visitor's center and watched "The Lamb of God," and "Witnesses of Christ."  Great movies!    After going to the visitor's center, we had a visiting teaching conference to go to.  That was great.  I can't remember a more spiritual Sunday.  It was a little bit hard to come back to the world this morning.

						   Yesterday, as I was leaving work, I met up with LB in the parking lot.  He had a meeting all afternoon with TW...  Ok, I need to back this up with the story, so here goes.  LB is my boss.  He is a funky little guy with a great personality.  He is disabled and in a wheelchair, and is always making jokes about how he and I are going to get married and how I should just close the door and "get it over with," etc.  Basically, he is a sexual harrassment suit waiting to happen, but it is funny, and I know that he is just kidding.  So LB has been "seeing" this girl from work (TW) that is living with her (then) boyfriend.  LB and TW were, as they say, friends with benefits.  Of course I dissapproved of this relationship - mostly because it's just wrong - and because I didn't think she was in it for the same reason that he was.  So a couple weeks ago, 2 days before TW marries the live in boyfriend, she tells LB that she is getting married.  He had no idea, so he was crushed.  Since then, it has been strained between LB and TW to say the least.    The second point that will help this to make sense is to say that LB and I have an interesting relationship... I am a little bit smart-alecky with him, but its generally all in fun (and he is smart alecky right back).    So, back to the parking lot... I don't know what went on in this meeting, but I am guessing that it wasn't fun.  So I went up to talk to him to see how he was, and he practically jumps down my throat saying something about how he called for me and I (insert expletive here) yelled at him.  Whoa there hon.  Where did that come from... and why is it directed at me?  It gave me some stress for a while until I figured out that something negative happened in the meeting.  This morning he was fine.  I was going to ask him about it, but I didn't get the opportunity before we had a staff meeting where he brought up that he doesn't feel like he is treated properly around here.  I thought it was a little extreme for just that one incident, so something else must be going on.  He has heard the last of the smart aleck comments from me!

						   I found a great website!  A woman who lays out exactly what she wants in a man, and without being condescending or witchy.  I concur.  The link is to your right.  The Redhead.

						   So I found this website called the friday five on one of my favorite sites, beingswift.org (find the link to your right), and I wanted to get started, even though today is Thursday.  So, I will just do the new one tomorrow too and call it good!     1.  What do you do for a living? I work for a university as a receptionist/personal assistant.  I am a personal assistant to my boss, who is disabled and in a wheelchair.  2.  What do you like most about your job? I love my boss.  He is a great guy, and we have a lot of fun.  We spend a good portion of the day making fun of each other and laughing.  The other thing that I really love is the fact that school is paid for.  Yes, that is right, I go to a major university, I don't pay any tuition, and they pay me!  3.  What do you like least about your job? Stupid people!  It is amazing the concentration of stupid people that come in or call.  Dude, if they didn't answer, that probably means that they are busy or not in their office.  This is where a neat little invention called voicemail comes in.   4.  When you have a bad day at work, it is usually because _____... I don't generally have bad days at work, but usually when I do, its because it is really busy or because I woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  5.  What other careers are you interested in? I am going to school to become a mechanical engineer at the moment, but that is changing soon to Photography.  I decided that in this one area of my life, I am going to be impractical, but I am going to have fun and enjoy what I do.  I don't care if I have to work at Sears for the rest of my life, I am going to have some awesome pictures of my kids (when I have kids!), husband (yep, when I have one of those too), and other friends and family.

						   There is only one more day left until the weekend.  I am excited for this weekend because there are lots of fun things to do.  There is a free movie in the park ("Holes"), some jazz ensembles playing, the Maricopa County Fair, and more.  On Thursdays I like to send out an email to my friends called "The Weekend Update," which outlines everything that is going on (that I know about), and invites people to get involved.  I am generally unsuccessful in getting people to join in... not sure why.  I think some people are lazy and don't want to get out and do things that require any sort of effort.  And I think the others just want to do spontaneous things.  My boss (LB), a little weird man who has become a great friend since I have worked at my current job, told me this morning that he can't figure out why I am not involved with anyone.  His exact words were "I am not sure why the boy's aren't flocking to you."  I said that I though it was because I am socially inept (I was only half joking), but he disagreed.  That was a little ego boost.  As much as I would like to cover it up, it really bugs me that Mel is getting married after dating a guy for 3.5 months.  Ok, ok, I know that is the normal Mormon thing to do, but what the heck?  You just meet someone and then get married?  Why does that work for some people, and for others it fails miserably.  And here is a better question:  Why is it that some of the most wonderful, beautiful women I know are single?  Ok, I admit it, I am jealous, and I don't want to talk about it.    Alright, I want to talk about it a little bit.  I am annoyed that she meets this guy, falls in  luv , then suddenly I don't exist anymore.  She has done one, yes, just one, thing with me since she met D.  She invites him to girl's night, for pete's sake!  How healthy could a relationship possibly be if you spend every spare moment together since you MET?!  Really girls, make him work a little bit for your attention!  He doesn't have to do back flips, but at least let him demonstrate that he is genuinely interested in you for you, and not just because it is convienient and you cook him dinner every night.  (we are talking about bachelors here... we know that they live on corn dogs and hot pockets when there isn't a gal in their life).  I have been in a mood lately.  I really have been trying hard to get out of it... going to the temple, staying out of the house, doing family history work, signing up for institute council, etc.   Last night, I went to the temple from about 6 to almost 10.  I felt rushed for the first hour or so, until I realized that I felt rushed, then I relaxed and let it go.  I came home feeling much better, but it all came back this morning.  I can't really pinpoint a cause... and its not so much a bad mood as it is a sad mood.  I am not sure that it would even be called depression... just a little supressed.    Institute is tonight.  It is the second to last week of class, which is a bummer because the class is SO good.  I am in LDS Relationships, and I am so proud of myself, this entire semester, I have only missed 1/2 of a class!  Brother P, one of the teachers of the class, is a sociologist and a marriage counsellor.  He is very interesting and has many insights into relationships and communication that I would have never thought of before.  His wife co-teaches the class with him, and her part is making the lesson spiritual.  I love them both.  After class every week, we have a social hour, and I usually end up staying up way too late.    My parents leave for Sacramento tomorrow.  Jim, my grandma's companion of 20+ years, passed away suddenly last week.  My grandma passed away a couple years ago, so at least she isn't alone.  This is hard in itself, but it is compounded by the fact that I have had a funeral in my life every weekend for the last 4 weeks.  That is too much death.  The first two were old, old friends from my old stomping grounds.  One died needlessly in a car accident because she wasn't wearing a seatbelt, and the other just dropped dead suddenly (presumably from a complication of epilepsy).  They were both under the age of 30.  The third was of course Sister Hinckley.  I hope that they can feel the love in the spirit world that we have for them on this side of the veil.

						   It is amazing what a trip to the temple will do for a person.  Last night I went to the family history center and worked on getting some names ready, then I went and started the work for 10 men and women from my family.  I can't wait to go back tonight, I feel so much better.  There is so much peace and love there!  When I went in, I was so stressed and worn out, then I sat and meditated and reflected on the sacred-ness of the covenants made there, and when I left I felt whole and much more centered.  Math test today too... I think I am going back to the temple tonight.

						   I have spent my whole life picking the hard road and then falling on my face.  Case in point: Mechanical Engineering.  I strongly dislike Physics.  And what is mechanical engineering if it isn't physics?  I consider myself a smart girl, and I love math, but I hate this decision that I made.  I want to do something fun, like Photography.  The practical person inside me says that I need to stick with engineering or switch to something equally unfun like Math, because what am I going to do with a degree in Photography?  It is impractical.  This is becoming an emotional decision for me.

						   I am feeling like I was hit by a truck this weekend.  I am a weakling.    People are annoying me today as well...  I work for a major University, and I think they admit some of the stupidest students in the nation.  One kid missed his original appointment with the advisor, so he thought he should get special treatment and an appointment earlier than next week.  Umm... sorry... no.    At least I am over the "no marriage for me" phase that I was going through last night.  (loosing a toenail in bed is still disgusting though).  I remembered how absoutely adorable Emi (my "adopted" niece) was when she was born (and still is), and how much I want kids someday... and how being married is a requirement for having babies.  *sigh*    And speaking of marriage (name that move:  Mawidge is what bwings us togetha today.  Wuv, Twoo Wuv... ), Mel and D set a date: July 2nd.  I am torn between feeling sad that my best friend isn't going to be my roomate anymore and feeling really happy for them.  They are a good match, and I think they will be happy well into the eternities.  Mel asked me to be her Maid of Honor... Yee Haw.  It should be fun!  I am excited to plan the shower.  I have lots of ideas.  I recently met a guy... a friend of a friend.  The mutual friend that introduced us told me later that she thought we would be a good for each other (we both have a mind for math).  I don't know what this friend told him.  He is cute, and seems interesting... So anyway, R thinks that he is going to call, and of course, since she is convinced, I start getting my hopes up.  I am afraid that I am setting myself up for disappointment.  I am not having good luck with boys lately.  (not only that, but I told the Dad/Bro Story... the one where I caught my dad putting round band-aids on his nips...)  Basically, I haven't been on a really great date in... well, ever.  Ok, I take that back.  I have planned and executed several group dates in which I asked a guy that seemed interesting out, and those are usually pretty good.  (the most successful one ever:  Lasagna, garlic bread, salad, and Cranium at my house).    My political irritation of the day:  Ok kids.  I saw a bit of this debate on the Today show this morning.  I am not old enough to remember Vietnam, but I did have an American History class in high school where we talked about the Vietnam war in depth, and I can tell you this about that:  the war that we (yes, WE) are waging right now in Iraq is absolutely  not  another Vietnam.  There is no question about this in my mind, and I want to talk to the moron that thought it up.  We have lost approximately 450 valiant, patriotic, brave men and women in Iraq so far, and this is about the same number of men that were lost in a single week during the deadliest parts of the Vietnam war.  And then the most obvious comparison:  the Vietnam conflict did not involve America.  Lyndon B. Johnson made it our business, and in affect, caused all of those deaths.  The war in Iraq directly involves America.  The Iraqui government supported the group that killed thousands of people on American soil.  Think about it people.  Does anyone know what a rebel yell is?  I have been wondering for weeks.

						   So I have decided that I am never getting married.  Mel's fiance, D, told us tonight, at dinner no less, that he once smashed his toe and then he lost his toenail.  That isn't so bad.  The gross part is that he went to bed with the toenail, and woke up without the toenail.  I don't think that I can sleep with a man's unattached toenail... I am not even sure that I want to sleep with a man's  attached  toenail.  (not much grosses me out, but that really does.)

						   I went caving today with a big group of friends to Peppersauce Cave, which is about 2 hours from my house.  That was so fun!  I have never been so dirty in my whole life.  I was covered in mud from head to toe.  I was made to sqeeze through spaces that a human should never go.  I will post pictures as soon as I get them.  G and J were our guides on this trip.  G is crazy!  The man will go anywhere.  Thankfully, J is a little more cautious.    While I was in one spot, the Lemon Squeeze, G was helping me on one side of this tiny hole, and C was helping on the other, I started laughing so hard that I could not move... then I realized that my pants were not sliding in the same direction that I was, and I could not do a thing about it.  That made me laugh even harder.  When I finally got out of that hole, I found that my pants were about an inch from completely gone.  Poor G and C... they saw me at my worst.    After we got home from caving, R and I decided that we needed to get cute and go dancing.  What a bust!  I was so not up for it.  I really just wanted to be in bed with my eyelids locked in the closed position.  We only went because R met a guy last week that she wanted to see again.  She saw him at institute on Thursday, and he mentioned that he would be going... but he was a no show.    You have to wonder about guys sometimes.

						   Ok, as evidenced by my last couple of posts, I have been pretty depressed.    So I took a couple of days off of work to focus on what is going on, and to try to fix it.    I spent Tuesday putzing around, I went to the Family History Center, then to the temple with Renada.  Afterward we went out to dinner and had a good long talk.  At some poin on Tuesday, I spoke with my mother.  What a downer.  She is  convinced   that I am 'repressing' something that I "just need to get out," and she is also convinced that whatever it is, is not allowing me to make decisions about my life in a timely manner. Ok, whatever, shut up.    Points I need to get out there: 1.  Even if I were 'repressing' something, (which I am not) why the HECK would I want to "get it out" now???  What good could that possibly do?  I don't NEED to remember anything terrible, thanks though.  2.  What decisions have I not made?  Ok, so I am having a little trouble deciding what to do in school.  It was just my first 'real' semester not taking general ed stuff.  So I decided that I don't like Physics, BIG DEAL.  So, I decided that I need to do something that I *GASP* actually like.  That should be good, right?  Basically, all my mother succeeded in with this conversation is alienating me a little more, and making me feel just a little bit worse about myself.  She is absolutely convinced that I am "sick." Thanks mom for the vote of confidence.  You know, I seem to recall a time when I was younger... much younger in fact, that I was taken to some kind of so called physician who put me on some drug that made me feel AWFUL because I apparently was having mental issues... and then I was forced to go to a therapist to "get it out" (I smell a theme).  Ok, I was a normal kid who was NEVER allowed to make any decisions for herself because I lived with a couple of overbearing, anal-retentive parents.  Let me be, mother!  EVERYONE has bouts of depression, DO NOT try to make it worse for me.  And EVERYONE needs time to make the correct decision regarding what they will be doing for THE REST OF THEIR LIFE.  (now if I could just say this to her.  I am just going to refuse to discuss it with her again)  Yesterday, I did nothing... and I do mean nothing, all day.  I sat and watched TV.  It was fun.  Today, I have a renewed energy.  I have been inspired by  urlLink Sarah  to focus on loosing more weight.  I have about 50lbs to go, and that goal that I forgot about to run a half marathon or 10k in October.  I have a new (much more fun) roomate moving in who will be my exercise and eating right partner, and things are looking up.  I feel much better today.

						   This weekend kindof stunk.  Friday night, I went home and tried to fix the vacuum... tried being the operative word.  I was so frustrated with it and all the other stuff that has been going on at home that I just had a complete meltdown.  I kept it to myself, but I think Melanie and Dan saw it coming, because Dan ended up fixing the vacuum for me, which I truly appreciate.  Renada came over after her date and we chatted for a little while... superficial stuff.  Saturday, I putzed around all morning... went out to the farmer's market and the scrapbooking store (aka mecca... heaven music plays as I walk in), then I did a little house hunting with Brian, which was fun.  Saturday evening, I had planned a game night, which I invited 30 or so people to.  Renada was the only one that showed up.  At first, I was ok with it, cause I wasnt really in the mood for entertaining, but then I thought about it a little bit.  It really hurts my feelings that no one even had the courtesy to call or email me and give me an excuse for not coming.  So basically, I am done.  I am not planning anything else.  I put together a trip to the Salt River for next Saturday that I have at least one confirmed person coming to (besides Renada), and if it turns out that he is the only one that shows up, fine.  The only reason I do this stuff is because I want to get people together and have a good time outside of church, but obviously, no one is interested.  Sunday after church, I made dinner for one of my neighbors that just had a baby, then I made dinner for Renada, Elizabeth and myself... then we talked for a long time.  I can't wait until Elizabeth moves in!!  I need to have a roomate again that I can talk to so I am not so lonely.  Melanie is just not my friend anymore... and whatever.  She has completely alienated me with her holier-than-thou attitude, and I can't wait until she moves out.

						   I am exceedingly grumpy today, so I am going to vent.  1.  When I got home yesterday, I found that my sister had moved most of her crap into my house for the summer while she is travelling.  This was no big deal, I had planned on it.  The problem was that she left her stuff strung everywhere. My room was filled with stuff, the living area piled high, etc.  To say the least, it was not a pleasant thing to come home to.  When I called her to come over and help me arrange stuff so that the place is livable for the next 4 months, I found that she was in Tucson, a two hour drive from my house.  Had she been within reach, I would have throttled her.  That is so freaking irritating!  She left her stuff piled everywhere, and then just leaves me to deal with it.  2.  Melanie is freaking annoying me.  Its been a great ride, but I will be glad when she is out.  She has absolutely no respect for my things.  She doesn't take care of them, she doesn't cop to it when she breaks stuff.  Case in point:  I needed to vacuum last night while I was rearranging my room (to make everything fit, see above), and I found that the carpet attachment is broken.  BROKEN!  I nearly went postal.  Its a VERY expensive vacuum that she obviously doesn't know how to use properly, so the attachment was shoved on, then broken.  I am not sure that I can fix it.  To this, she had the GALL to tell me this morning that maybe it was time that I purchase a new vacuum altogether.  Ok, just for giggles, I priced the same vacuum that I have at sears online this morning.  $450.00.  So if you read about a girl who maimed her roomate in Arizona, it may be me.    3.  I am an anal person.  I have a messiness threshold that is probably much lower than most, but I generally don't complain if there is a mess in the house.  Ok, and I can admit that I am one of the few people on the earth that knows how clean things properly... and since I know this about myself, I try to reign it in a little bit.  Lately, I have been less anal than usual because I haven't been feeling very well, and I have been extremely busy.  Here's my problem:  when Melanie cleans the house she:  a)stacks stuff right inside my bedroom door (Major no-no, HUGE peeve.  My room is off limits.  Stack stuff on the sidebar outside my room, but never put stuff inside.  I show you the same courtesy)  b)cleans the kitchen but either doesn't wipe the counter and stove off or leaves 2 or 3 dishes in the sink (wha...what the heck?  why not just get done?  and by the way, the kitchen isn't clean until the counters are wiped and not covered in crumbs, sticky stuff and other unidentifiable substances)  c)Vacuums the carpet and leaves the tile dirty (how does that serve any purpose whatsoever?)  d)spends an inordinate amount of time cleaning the bathroom, but leaves the rest of the house a mess (fyi: when your house is a huge pigsty, people don't even want to go in your bathroom, so the point of cleaning it in excess is lost)  e)refuses to use real cups (I have a ton of plastic cups, glasses, mugs, anything you can think of, but she buys freaking ghetto paper cups and leaves them all over the place)  f)leaves shoes, (and worse) dirty socks, and mailstuffs stacked all over the place, even after she has cleaned the place.  Ok, I feel slightly better now that I sound like a huge obsessive compulsive freak.  I should say though that the roomate stuff has been building up over a period of almost 2 years, and has recently become much worse (now that she has herself a man).  I should also say that I don't usually say anything about any of this because it is easier to either ignore it or finish/fix it myself.  Everyone has their own definition of clean, and it is up to that person to maintain it... and vent about it later.

						   I am so excited to go see Shrek 2 tonight!  I have been waiting for it for a long time, and I hear that it is better than the first one (which amused me mostly because of the bathroom humor, which I LOVE.)  Just a few minutes ago, I was walking to the Student Union to get some lunch, and I saw TDan walking in my direction.  My stomach went (and I quote) "blup bligga bligga, rogolvkngilkangildkne, HEAVE!" and my mind went "oh, NO!"  I had 150 yards to think of something to say, but it wasn't far enough.  I could come up with nothing.  Apparently neither could he, because he left me to flounder for conversation.  AWKWARD.  I told him that I am the lunch runner of the day, and he told me that he was going to the library and to get a fork for his lunch, then there was silence.  I wanted to run away.  What have I created for myself here?  I thought of something not-so-good last night.  Since I moved into this ward, I have dated two members of the bishopric (TDan, ward clerk,  and another guy, whom we will call BE, tithing clerk).  Have I become infamous in the clerk's office?  I know the bishop hears stuff, because he has asked me about BE before... back when we were 'an item,' so obviously they talk in there.  Speaking of 'oh, NO's.'

						   Speaking of dating and boys... I recieved this email this morning.  I proceeded to forward it to my best good friend Renada.  This is our conversation.  I find it hilarious.  I am not entirely certain what it is in this email that makes Renada think that he is putting the moves on me, but... here it is.     Lindsay (spelled wrong!),  I meant to email you earlier and tell you that I definitely want to be in on this trip tubing down the River.  I've never done it before, but I've heard it's a blast.  2.5 hours sounds great to me--I'm not sure what kind of feedback you've received from everyone else.  And depending on which weekend in June you're planning on going to SLC, I might want to go with you.  My old roommate's wife is having a baby sometime in June and I'd love to go see them.  Keep me informed on that one as well.  Hope your week is going well.  Josh   Renada - Hummmm.  Josh - in our ward just broke off engagement Josh?    me - Yep, that Josh.  Yay.  Renada - humm  I think he may be making the moves!  me - You are just saying that to make me feel good.  I love you for it.    Renada - The guy wouldn't respond if he didn't want to see about pursuing it (I don't think anyways)  And if I'm I'm wrong then the guys simply crazy!   And... my response to Josh:  Hey Josh – Thanks for responding!  So far, the few responses that I have had are voting for 2.5 as well.  It will be really fun!  It’s still on for a week from Saturday (the 29th), meeting at the E building at 7:30am.  As for Salt Lake, we haven’t picked a weekend yet, but it will probably be in the later part of the month.  I have to go to Sacramento again next month (not sure when yet), and some of the other people that want to go also have other trips planned.  I will keep you updated.  Are you and Katherine still thinking about having the Majongg party?  I was thinking of having a game night at my house this Friday or Saturday evening, if you guys want to join in.  Just let me know.    Have a great week!  Lyndsay

						   In my last ward, there were two sisters (yes, they were actually blood sisters) who were certifiably manhungry.  I spent as little time as possible around them because I was afraid that it was catching.    One Sunday evening we were at a CES Fireside, where it is tradition to ask these questions:  1.  Who has recently recieved a mission call? 2.  Who has recently returned from a mission? 3.  Who has recently become engaged?  After asking these three questions, the person who was conducting decided to be funny and add this question onto the end:  4.  Who would like to become engaged?  (or something to that effect)  Instantly, the hands of these two sisters shot into the air.  It was painful.  I am still embarrassed for them.

						   Dating stinks.  We as mormons are pressured so much to find our "eternal companion," which isn't a bad thing, but sometimes it's a little overwhelming, and it is always frustrating.  To quote Life in Yellow:   Why don't cute LDS guys ask me out? They rarely even talk to me. What is it? The non-cute LDS guys I'm not remotely interested in ask me out a lot. Cute Non-LDS guys ask me out all the time. What's the deal? I think I'm competing with too many Barbies. Really.   I would like to add something to this:  Why is it that when a cute LDS boy finally does ask me out, its only because I put the moves on him first?? (or he  thinks   I put the moves on him... big difference)  All I really want is to be woo'ed.  Ask me out because you like me, even if you aren't sure if I like you or not.  Take me on a date.  A good one.  Put a little thought into it.  Be creative.  Sweep my off my feet, literally, if you must(...can).    So what is it?  Are guys just scared that they will be turned down?  I am nice, outgoing, friendly, I flirt (sometimes shamelessly), I go to dances, most (if not all) ward activities, I talk to everyone... Basically, I do everything they tell you to do when you want to make friends/find a date (but I have not crossed the manhungry/desperate line).  Is that so intimidating?  Heck, I have tons of girlfriends from it, but nary a date in sight.  Honestly, I am sick of asking boys out, but I am scared that I will not get any action at all if I stop setting up these group date things and Sunday dinners.  But I have since stopped asking guys to dinner that I would really like to get to know - see the aforementioned reason... I want them to ask me first.  (With the exception of John, whom I asked to be my date on a big group date a long time before I made this decision).  I am of the opinion that men should be men, and should be allowed to do the manly things in a relationship, i.e. the asking out part, the driving, the picking of the restaurant (at least on the first date).  I am not dying for a date, I have other things to keep me busy.  I am just expressing the general sentiment of myself and most of my girlfriends.  My point?  Get it together boys!  Ask girls out.  Who cares if you aren't sure that is something there.  You should have 2 or 3 dates a week, budget allowing.  The more you date, the better at it you become, and the more you know what you want in a companion (same goes for girls).  And really, unless you are a total creep, most girls wouldn't even consider turning you down.

						   I just read Sarah Marinary, and I was reminded of two things:  1.  Dancing is fun!  2.  I love San Francisco!   To further expound on the above....  1.  I have been reading my grandma's diaries from 1936 - 1945.  During these years, she goes to dime shows almost every night, hangs out with a TON of boys (yes, I am jealous), goes dancing 3 or 4 times a week, meets my grandfather, and then about 4 years later, marries him.  Ok, I love to dance!  I would go every night if I had a partner who was willing and able... and why the heck not?  Next semester, I am have a dance class on Wednesday nights, a Friday night gig that I just heard about, and of course, our regular Saturday night dances.  And all of this is why I am interested in John and Josh.  The men are good looking, funny, have things to say, and are spectacular dancers.  By the way, its a blessing and a curse to be interested in two guys at once, because you know how Mormons are:  no dating more than one person at a time.  (I am not talking about serious dating... just the casual kind)  Anyhow...  2.  San Francisco is the funnest city ever.  Enough said.

						   Back to the weekend.  Saturday evening, Renada picked me up at the airport, then we went up to her house where her mom had made dinner.  Neither of us had much energy, but we went dancing anyway.  None of our favorite regulars were there, which was a bummer so I tried to talk Renada into going somewhere else to dance, but she wouldn't have it.  I didn't feel particularly cute anyway... and I am not much interested in being picked up by drunk guys.  Sunday morning, both Renada and I looked HOT for church.  We were joking that they would need to crank the a/c up in the building so that people wouldn't sweat so much due to our hotness.  :)  Sacrament went fairly uneventfully, but directly afterward, we went to get tithing slips, and I was cornered in the hallway by TDan.  He asked me if I was alright... I said yep, returned the courtesy, and started to walk away.  He stuttered a bit and said, "can we talk later?"    Crap.    Apparently I wasn't clear enough last weekend... which I kind of knew, but I was hoping... anyway.  So I told him that we would talk after church, then I went on my merry way to Relief Society.  When RS was over, I was sitting in my spot, talking to Renada, when she says "trouble at 3 o'clock, wanna trade seats with me?"  (so I could be on the end, and not have an empty seat next to me).  I declined for obviousness' sake... TDan was within noticing distance.  Of course, TDan decided to ask me if he could sit next to me.  What does a polite girl say to that?  No?  Probably not.  So I said 'sure.'    Sunday School went fairly uneventfully... but directly when it was over, I said to TDan "What's the scoop?" To which he said "I was going to ask you the same thing."    Ok, I should say that there is still an entire sunday school class still in the room, milling around, and within hearing distance.  So basically, I have to crush this man's heart while people listen and critique my form.  yeech.  So I told TDan (who for the record, is a good guy, just not the good guy for me) that I just am not feeling it, and that I don't want to force or drag out anything that isn't right.  I also told him that I feel terrible about leaving him hanging for a week, but I really needed some time to figure things out.  TDan said something to the effect of "I can't argue with a feeling.... We can still be friends, right?"  Of course, kiddo.  And that was that.  The door is closed, locked, bolted, and there isn't even a peephole.  Yay.  There is a HUGE weight removed from my shoulders.  So, I got up from talking to TDan, walked over to John, and asked him if he wanted to come to dinner at my house.  I am EVIL, evil I tell you.  John couldn't, but he is coming next week.  Yay!  Since Renada was expecting a boy to come over, I had to find someone else to ask, so I called Derek.  Side note about Derek:  I love Derek dearly.  He is a tall, redheaded goofball, but sometimes he is SO wise!  Derek dated my roomate for a little bit, but that worked out badly, and he cried on my shoulder for weeks.  At the time, I wasn't thinking anything of that... he is just a good friend, but lately, I have been thinking otherwise.  I went over to his house last week to talk and be social, and we had a really good, really deep conversation.  And he is so comfortable to be around.  I don't know if he has any thoughts on the subject, but I wouldn't be opposed if he wanted to have a more in depth relationship.    Back to Sunday...  after church, we had a series of appointments.  First, our home teachers came over.  I have been having some issues (physical and otherwise) lately, so I asked Shawn and Steve if they would give me a blessing.  oh my goodness... As soon as those boys put their hands on my head (Melanie's Dan joined in), the spirit filled the room... stronger than I have ever felt it before.  Steve gave the blessing... The man is in touch with the spirit.  He said things that no one could know and that I really needed to hear.   Instantly, I was overwhelmed and started to cry.  It was amazing, and I am still reveling in the spirit that was brought into my home.  I am so fortunate to have strong priesthood brethren as my home teachers.  I grew up in a home that, for the majority of the time I lived there, had no priesthood at all, and then when we finally did, it was far from strong.  I wouldn't even consider asking my father for a blessing... mostly because I am fairly certain that he would say no.  Which brings me to criteria number one for my future eternal companion:  Strong priesthood holder.  No exceptions, no non-members.  My children deserve as much.  After our home teachers left, our visiting teachers came over.  That was fun and interesting... Then our dinner party arrived.  We had breakfast for dinner, then played games.  It was fun.  Our attendees were:  Nate (Renada asked him... I forsee no future for them), Derek, Marlee, Cambria, Jenna, Melanie and Dan, and myself.    Last night was fairly uneventful.  I stayed home and worked on the suitcase full of papers and pictures that I brought back from Sacramento.  I am mounting everything on cardstock and putting it in plastic paper protectors... when I get all that done, I am going to attempt to put everything in chronological order in binders.  I am so excited, it's going to turn out really well I think.  I am going to continue to work on it tonight as well.

						   Or at least it seems like it.  I had a great weekend.  I left Thursday morning for Sacramento.  My uncle owns a house that my grandma had been living in until she passed away a couple of years ago.  We were there to clean it out and get it ready to rent.  I would have never guessed that digging though 25 years of stuff could be so much fun!  I found old papers dating back to the twenties, diaries, pictures (oh, the cool pictures!), marriage licenses, death and birth certificates, all kinds of great stuff!  I am so excited to sort though it.    A couple of hilarious things that happened this weekend:  1.  I had to sleep in the same bed as my dad all weekend (weird!!).  Friday night, I was laying in bed watching tv, and my dad gets in and just lets one RIP.  Like he had been saving it up.  I am back to my 'Boys, who needs em' stage.  (But I did ask John R. to dinner on Sunday... he couldn't come, but next week baby.  Oh yeah, next week)  2.  My dad and uncle bought a new seat for the only toilet in the house.  I was fortunate enough to be the inaugural user.  My uncle called me on it.  (if this isn't funny, think about it a little bit longer).    Sunday, I had a chat with TDan.  Awkward.  That door is finally closed.  When I have more time, I will tell all about it.  I have had an extremely busy day today.  I do have lots to say about Sunday though... ;)

						   1.  You are attracted to those who are unbridled, untrammeled, and     free.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is patience, never give up on you.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is loyal,     faithful, never change.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too     moody; and you don't know how to please him/her.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is that both of you can talk about everything and     anything, no secret is kept.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,     you'll treasure it and your partner very much.  8.  At this moment, you don't want to be tied down by a steady     relationship, you just want to flirt around.

						   I just read  urlLink this  article, and I am sickened.    I am sickened by the fact that American soldiers alledgedly tortured prisoners of war, and I am equally sickened by the allegation that the Iraqis have reciprocated in this disgusting way.    My father was in the military until I was 17 years old, and I can not believe that these American soldiers have been accused of torturing prisoners of war.  I was under the (apparently mistaken) impression that these men and women who have willingly signed up to protect and serve the United States of America possess some pride in what they do, dignity in knowing that they stand between us as civilians and the enemy, and respect for life.  How could these men an women allow the hate that pervades Iraqi society to seep into their consciousness?  Sinking to this level can only make the hatred toward Americans worse.  I know for a fact that this is not a value that is taught in the American Military.    Yeah, ever hear of the Geneva Convention??  Ok, I just lost my passion for the subject.  I got distrated one too many times by my freaky, demanding, little boss.

						   8.  He reminds me of my dad.  I barely lasted 18 years living with my anal, rigid, rule making father.  Why would I subject myself to an  eternity   of it with a husband?  9.  He isn't appreciative of the arts.  He doesn't/hasn't gone to the theater, concerts, symphonies, etc. And I dont think that he would have been truly supportive of my decision to switch to photography with no engineering mixed in there.  Ok, I am done.  Obviously he isn't the one for me, and I need to stop beating myself up over this.  I did the right thing.  I am better off.  He is better off.  I can move on.  After I say this:  His - 125, mine - 138.

						   Brian, my boss, took me to High Tea at the Arizona Biltmore Resort (5 star), on Saturday afternoon.  What a great idea for a date!!  It was a really great atmosphere, and I didn't think that it was over priced.  It was three courses, sandwiches, scones, and desserts, and there was a huge selection of teas.  I had a tea called Red Hawaiian, which was a fruit and berry tea that tasted like warm Koolaid, yummy!  Brian and I talked about lots of fun stuff... mostly relationship stuff.  It's all so soap opera-ey.  The desserts were chocolatey... and very good.  There was one that was some kind of chocolate thing with thin wafers inside.  It was SO good.  I have been referring to it as the 'Better than EVERYTHING' chocolate.  Brian said that I looked like I needed a cigarette after I was done.  Seriously, it was the best chocolate I have EVER tasted.

						   My parents run marathons.  This weekend, they ran one in Farmington, New Mexico.  I did not know about it until Sunday morning, right before church, when I called my sister to see if she was going to drive down to Tucson for Mother's day. She told me that they were going to pass through town around dinner time and that they were going to meet with her for dinner.  I normally refuse to go to dinner with them on Sunday, but it was mother's day, so I was going to make an exception.  I told her to call me when they were close, and I would meet them.  She told me that it wouldn't be before 5, and that they would call.  So, my dad calls me at 5ish and says that they are just finishing with dinner.  What the heck!?!?  They didn't even bother to try to include me.  I wasn't even invited to dinner.  Yeah, that hurt my feelings a little bit.  So I said:  Why don't you swing by my house for a minute before you head home, because I have something for mom?  Nope.  Wouldn't do it.  She said:  "You are going to see dad next week, just give it to him then."  Wow, ain't that special.  I am so glad I made the effort to get a gift for mother's day... I can see that she really is enthused about it.

						   Ok, Friday night went ok.  Dan is pretty good with the kids.  We snuggled on the couch after they went to bed, but I pretty much came to terms with the fact that I am just not feeling it.  I have been feeling blase about the whole thing for a while now, but it just hit me on Friday night that I was making a big mistake by letting it continue any further.    Basically, the progression of this relationship was a little messed up.  He got the wrong idea in the beginning... honestly, I was just being myself and he took it to mean that I had an interest in him... and maybe there was a little bit of interest, but I was just feeling it out, I wasn't intending to jump into an exclusive relationship with him.  So when he started putting the moves on, I was thinking, "ok, let's just see where this goes."    Saturday morning, I was supposed to meet a couple of my girlfriends at the temple for the 8am session, but I was running late and didn't get there in time.  I ended up in the 830 session.  Of course, Dan was with me.  I didn't have the heart to uninvite him.  I think he knew something was up from Friday night, because I didn't let him kiss me.   After the session, we made lunch and hung out on the couch for a while.  I had my 'date' with Brian (my boss... more on this date in a bit), then we went and did a little shopping for Mother's day.  I decided to let Dan come dancing with Renada and me... then we went to Village Inn for a very late dinner.  I knew for absolutely certain that Dan wasn't the one when I saw the boy on the dance floor.  I have never seen a whiter white boy dance in my whole life.  It was hilarious.  (not that my ability to love a guy revolves around his ability to dance, but seriously, he was terrible, and I was looking for a solid, tangible justification to give him the heave ho)  (side note:  he is a good slow dancer)    At the restaurant, while Dan was paying, Renada pulled me aside and said "girl, we need to talk."    Oh crap.  I smell an intervention.   So I drove Dan to his house, then Renada and I had a good chat.  I told her how I had been feeling, and she encouraged me to extricate myself from the situation.  We talked for a long time... then we called Jake to see what he thought.  Jake said, "Lynds, I was going to pull you aside the next time I saw you and say:  Girl, what are you doing here?  This guy is so not right for you."  Ok, so according to my friends, who know me the best, my previous decision was definitely the correct one.  So Sunday, I got to church a little late, and didn't sit in my regular spot... In fact, I squeezed myself into a row filled with girls. I think that gave Dan the definite hint that something was very much up.  After Sacrament, he came up to talk to me, and I was exceedingly aloof.  He asked me if I was going to Tucson, and when he found out that I wasn't (more on that in a moment), he asked me if I wanted to go with him to his family's house.  Um, no way.  No.  I was nice about it, but no.  I went home directly after Sacrament, I just needed some time alone.  I napped for a while, then my friend Derek called.  I decided to go over to his house, then go see a couple other friends that live near him.  I got home at about 1030, and there was a message on the machine from Dan.  It was late, but I needed to get it over with, so I called.  I cited my manic tendencies, and told him that I needed "a little, or a lot, of space."  I told him also that I felt like the relationship was not progressing naturally... like it was forced a little bit.  He got it... though I kind of feel like the door might be a little bit ajar, and I would really like the door to be securely bolted closed.   He seemed to take it well, and said "well, that is good for me as well."  So this chapter is over, and not soon enough (but only 18 days after it began).   Reasons why Dan isn't the right one (just in case I look back on this and think "Why did I do that?"):   1.  He is young.  3 years younger than me, and it shows.  2.  He is immature, socially.  He didn't go to high school at all... because he is freakishly smart and went directly to college after junior high (side note:  even though he is freakishly smart, my IQ is higher than his!  Yee haw).    3.  He is hard to have a conversation with.  I ask him questions, and he doesn't reciprocate very well.  4.  When we are together, I am ALWAYS the leader.  I really want a man who will take charge.  I want to feel like a lady, and when I have to give directions all the time, that just doesnt work for me.  Grow some cojones, honey, cause I am not going to.  This needs to be a healthy mix of taking charge without being a control freak.  5.  I have a MUCH more outgoing, relaxed personality than he does.  He is uptight and very serious.  I need a guy who will be goofy with me on occasion, AND be serious when I need him to be... again, a healthy mix.    6.  He is a rule follower.  Not that this is generally a problem but he is extreme.  I suspect that he was the mission companion from... yeah, we will just leave it at that.  7.  He was jealous of my male friends.  Ok, this one is partially acceptable/understandable, but get a grip.  I am going home with you.  I am kissing you.  I am allowing you to monopolize me on the dance floor.  Relax.  No need to pee on my leg.

						   Last Friday, David (Melanie's brother) called me to see if I would babysit his two boys, Hudson and Holton.  I was unavailable last week, but I offered to this week, tonight in fact.  I love those little boys!  Hudson is 3 and Holton is a little over a year.  I have been excited to go all week.   Dan just came by my office.  He is coming with me.  I know he will be good with the kids... He has 6 younger sisters, and the youngest is about a year old.  But will it be weird?    I am a psycho.  I stress over everything.  I need to relax.

						   I am done!  Finished with the major stress that is school and final exams.  Yay!!  I took the last one at 6:40 yesterday evening.  Yesterday was such a long day.  I spent the morning studying, had the physics test at noon, then I spent the afternoon studying for Pre-calc.    Around four, I was looking at some Trig stuff, and decided that I needed further instruction, so of course, I called Dan.  He is my Knight in Shining Armor.  All I had to say was: "I need a little help." and he said:  "I will be there."  He came to my office... made a special trip to campus.  When we were done with that, he walked me over to Chili's to meet Renada.    Unfortunately, Renada and I had to rush dinner because I was running late (for everything).  But we did get some good girl chat in.  Renada is interested in a guy named Shelby.  Shelby!  That sounds like a name that made it tough to get through high school in one piece.  I, for one, plan on teasing him if he lasts.    When I was done with the exam, I went home, put some comfortable clothes on, and lounged on the couch.  Renada, Cambria, and Jake to come over after institute to check out Renada's design for Jake's house.  Dan also came over after a meeting about his new calling, and we all sat around and chatted for a while.  After everyone else left, Dan put in 'The Saint' and we did our usual schnuggling on the couch.  After the movie, we sat outside talking for a bit... wow, this is hard to type.  Plus, I was/am so tired, that I dont think I was/am thinking clearly.  Anyway.  He is getting ready to leave… we are outside, hugging or something, and he says: “I love you.”       I was absolutely speechless.  I did not handle that very well.      Honestly, I have felt… what could be described as strong affection for him?  I don’t know, its only been like 3 weeks.  I am not good with feelings.  Really not good.  I can crack a joke on a dime, but start talking about feelings, and I blank.  I really do not like to talk about how I feel... probably because I am not interested in having my feelings hurt.  (duh)  I said 'wow.'  In retrospect, it would have been better to keep the trap shut.  I said something else like “this girl has lots of baggage… ," but I was really not ready to talk about that stuff yet.      Yeah, I suck at this.          To that he said, very seriously “Lyndsay, I will never hurt you.”  then... "It was stupid to say it when I am not 100% sure yet"  To which I said, "No, not stupid at all.  Very much the opposite."       Whoa there.  This is starting to read like a cheesy romance novel.  (The Mormon variety, No nudity, no heavy breathing, no tan hairy chests exposed to a scantily clad swooning woman on the cover.)  But not to make light of something that was intended in all seriousness... and really, I feel a little guilty about writing about a conversation that was really a very private moment, but this is effectively, my journal, so whatever.    It did end okay however... no weirdness (I don't think)... so we shall see what happens today and tomorrow.

						   Ok, interesting tidbit.  Last semester, Dan was the TA for my math instructor, Mark.  Mark always puts extra credit on the tests that have to do with movies.  He warned us about one on the final... and get this, he is using the same one as last semester, so Dan gave me the answer (yay!  My LDS boyfriend, who is also in the bishopric of our ward, is helping me cheat on a final exam!)   Note:  Dan has not confirmed with Mark that the answer that he gave me is, in fact, the correct answer.  It is pure conjecture on Dan's part.  Nothing wrong with that!

						   Yesterday was an interesting day.  (plug your ears boys) I woke up with KILLER cramps.  It was rough getting out of bed, and when I finally did get up, I discovered a huge mess.  Yuck.  So I stayed home yesterday... there was no going anywhere.  I spent a good portion of the day sleeping on the couch.    I did, however, go to the temple for ward temple night.  It was nice.  The woman I was doing work for was ready... I felt really good about doing her work for her.  After the temple, Dan took me home to change, then we went to his house to find a movie to watch.  Shawn and Andrea (the Target story) were there cooking dinner, and they had rented a movie, so we joined them in eating and watching.  The movie was "Big Fish," one of my favorites, and dinner was hamburger helper.  After dinner, we schnuggled on the couch... Dan didn't take me home until around 1.  I am pooped this morning, and not a little kinked from being in a weird position for two hours.    At some point during the evening, in reference to the fact that I offered to sell Shawn one of my couches (he has a batchelor pad, one couch, and a whole lot of crap, including an unused china cabinet that he would like to get rid of, which will make sense in a moment), Andrea said "You could trade Lyndsay for the couch."  In response, Shawn said jokingly "I don't think Lyndsay is mine to trade.  If she belongs to anyone, its Dan."  At this point, there was a long, pointed look at me from Dan.  He got a look of amusement from me.  I guess I didn't update Monday night either.  Monday night, Dan and I were going to just meet at FHE, but neither of us felt like going, so he came over to my house, and we talked for a long time.  I finally feel like we had a genuine conversation about things that mean something.  For the first time in a very long time, maybe ever, I feel like its ok if I share some of myself with this guy.     Monday night, I told Melanie and Dan about the creepy, sweaty guy that touched me inappropriately on Saturday... Dan was funny.  I told him that I was thinking of recruiting Melanie's giant brothers to beat the guy up, and Dan said that I needn't because he was going to deck the guy himself.  My knight in shining armor.    You know what I love?  An unshaven since yesterday morning face.  For some reason it makes me feel like a girly girl.  It's really too bad that an unshaven since yesterday morning leg doesn't make me feel the same way.

						   Ok, I have an addition or two.  Yesterday, during Sacrament, I had a brief, yet overwhelming urge to drive to Tucson and hang out with my parents for the afternoon.  Last time I felt that way, I was just about to find out that this guy that I was seeing had been lying to me (found out the next Wednesday or Thursday the whole truth... had some suspicions before that).  Not just a little bit about trivial things, but he was a full on pathological liar.  His entire life was a huge lie.  Thank goodness I hadn't been seeing him for very long.  So when I got that thought, I was like, whoa there, why do I feel the need to run away today?  My guess?  Satan, as usual.  So today, when I talk to a couple of friends (Renada and Ryan) about something my sister said, I find out that I messed up when I asked Dan to go with me to the Temple.  Totally innocent mistake, but I am really feeling yicky about it now.  It is interesting how stuff gets turned around in your head.  .... I am not feeling closure on the subject, but I don't have time to write any more right now.

						   I am not sure where to begin today... I had such a good weekend.    Friday night, I had to work.  That was the pits, and I ended up working 13 hours straight on Friday.  I got to work a little after seven in the morning, and I got home a little after nine in the evening.  Melanie and her Dan were there, so we sat and kabitzed for a bit... I still hadn't heard from TD, and we were talking about that.  Right then, he called... He kind of redeemed himself for not calling for 2 days, but he said something that now I realize was unintentional (so I won't say what it was) that kind of bothered me until Sunday morning.    Saturday, I had intentions of going to the temple, but I didn't get up early enough.  So instead, I cleaned house, did lots of laundry, and did a little shopping.  Funny story:  On my way to Target, I had a thought that I was going to see a friend of mine: Andrea (randomly, TD's Roommate's Girlfriend).  I wandered through Target for a while, not thinking about it at all, and then Andrea walked by.  I have telepathic powers!  ;)  Saturday afternoon, my parents were up from Tucson, so I went to Liss's interior design thing (she is good!), then I went shopping with my mom (I got two new outfits, now I am broke), then to dinner with my family and another family that we have been hanging out with forever.  (Jim and Claudia are getting married!  Finally!)    Saturday night, Dancing, as usual.  It was a bust this week.  None of my favorite regulars were there.  There was this creepy guy there, sweaty hands, not much to say, etc.  The guy touched me!  Inappropriately!!!   On purpose!!  EW!  I almost just stopped dancing with him right then and there, and walked away.  I had to go de-louse after that.  I felt so violated.  How disgusting.  Sunday was Fast Sunday, and it was wonderful!!  The spirit was incredible.  I had an inspiration to go see my friend Marlee after Sacrament, but I decided to stay for Relief Society.  I was glad that I did because it was also filled with the spirit, but I should have left when I was inspired to... Because I just didn't have time to after that.  I got caught at the clerk's office waiting on a ward list with zips that I need for the shower invites.  Then I got caught talking to Darla (not a problem, she had some things that she needed to talk about), then I went home thinking that it was an hour later than it actually was, laid down to take a quickie nap, Darla came over, then Dan, then Elizabeth (Elizabeth is definitely moving in!! Yay!)    Dan was called to be the new ward clerk yesterday.  I have mixed feelings about this.  (side note:  since I joined this ward last September, there have been three ward clerks... Dan is number 4 in 7 months.  The reason for the high turnaround rate?  Wuv, Twue Wuv.  yep.  Marriage.  eek.)  While I was waiting for the ward list that I needed, I talked to Pete (assistant ward clerk) and Riley (exec. Secretary).  One of them said to me "hey, I noticed you sitting with a certain gentleman in Sacrament today.  He is a good guy.  You know he is the newest member of the Dream Team, how do you feel about that?"  (another side note:  Dan is so cute!  He asked me if he could put his arm around me in church yesterday.)  Dan and Elizabeth stayed until about 8... I fed them my famous meatballs.    I am feeling much better about Dan...  I think the comment that he made on Friday night was because he was uber stressed (sound familiar) and has been staying up all night.  I had plans to say something to the effect of "I don't feel like we communicate very well..."  But since Elizabeth was around the whole time, there was no good opportunity.  He did say something like "I have really been looking forward to spending time with you..."  This comment redeemed him a little bit.   I had a long chat with HF yesterday afternoon before anyone came over to the house, and I am feeling much more content/peaceful about the whole Dan thing.  I am too stressed and insecure about everything, I just need to sit back and relax.  (My insecurities have a root, and someday I will talk about it) Really, too much overanalyzing isn't good for anyone, and it is too much work.  When I was done , I had a sense of peace come over me... I think I just needed to get it out there and off my chest.    My problem is still that I have a hard time telling the difference in my head who is talking.  Is it the subconscious me saying what I want to hear, or is it really HF responding to my prayers??  I have no trouble with Satan's voice.  That is distinctly different... Thank goodness.

						   Lately, I have been pondering many things.  I have decided to throw a few of them out there for my loyal readers to contribute an opinion or two.    One that has been bothering me for a long time is in regards to the ten commandments.  Below, I have included an excerpt of  urlLink Exodus 20  from the King James Version of the Bible, which of course, you can read in it's entirety  urlLink here .   1 AND God spake all these words, saying,  3 Thou shalt have no other gods before me.  4 Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:  5 Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;  6 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my commandments.   7 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  8 Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  9 Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work:  10 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates:  11 For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it.  12 ¶ Honour thy father and thy mother: that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.  13 Thou shalt not kill.  14 Thou shalt not commit adultery.  15 Thou shalt not steal.  16 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.  17 Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.   Of course, some of these commandments are open to interpretation (a little bit), and I understand that not everyone subscribes to the teachings of the Bible.  For the purposes of argument, I would like to limit the people I am talking about to those people who do believe in the teachings of the Bible, and more specifically, the ten commandments.    The commandment that I would like to discuss seems to me to be pretty straightforward... even to a lay person such as myself.  Verse 7 states: Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.  So, my question is: Why is it that these people take the Lord's name in vain, when it is so clearly stated by the Lord himself not to?  These same people refrain from using other socially unacceptable words, so what makes it ok in their minds?    There are many words that are taboo to say, examples of which you do not need.  These words are taboo  solely  because  people  say they are.  Heavenly Father has set forth one (ok, maybe 4 or 5) word that is absolutely unacceptable to say, and yet that one word is the most common swear word.  I don't get it.  (and yes, I realize that those other expletives are specifically unacceptable by LDS standards, but I am speaking in a broader context than just the church).    One day, not too long ago, I made this observation at work while talking to my boss (he makes an effort not to use words in front of me which I find offensive, and we were talking about it).  One of the girls in the office, who I know attends church, though I do not know which one, responded by saying that "It's a way of letting God know that we are not perfect, that we sin."  I had no response to this.  I still don't really understand what she was talking about, because it seems to me that there are better ways to admit that we are sinners... without blatant commandment-breaking.  Anyway, Thoughts?  Comments?  How do you respond to a person who continuously uses offensive language around you?    Case in point: I used to work with a woman who used Christ's name in vain between just about every word.  I avoided talking to her because her language was so offensive to me, but I never could think of what I could say to her to get her to stop... without offending her.  Isn't that funny.  Interesting reading:   urlLink Take Not the Name of God in Vain  - President Hinckley   urlLink President Kimball Speaks Against Profanity    urlLink The Third Commandment  - Ester Rasband  Topics I may discuss in later posts:  Polygamy, Mobbing in the early days of the church.

						   So, I found  urlLink this site  the other day, written by a very nice girl who lives in Iowa.  Her religion remains a mystery to me, but I suspect that since she likes Martin Luther, she is either a Lutheran or some other protestant religion (Unfortunately for my well-roundedness, I am not well versed in the beliefs of other religions).    Anyway, I read  urlLink this post  the other day, and it intrigued me because of her reference to believing that Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost were three separate beings constitutes heresy.  Obviously, I disagree.  I was curious (and asked her) who she thought Christ was praying to in the Garden of Gethsemane and in various other places.    Her response:    Jesus was praying to God the Father. God the Father just happens to be the same being as Jesus. If you would like to read a more polished explanation of the Trinity, you can try  urlLink here .   In looking for a good link for you, I found an interesting analogy for the Trinity. A book has a width, length, and thickness. Each aspect is essential to describing a book, and each accurately describes the book. But the description of the book isn't really complete without the other aspects.   A response by another person (whom I do not understand... ):   Regarding the book example, I see what you are trying to say. But there are problems with the analogy, afterall, within every analogy there is disanalogy (i.e. where the analogy breaks down). E.g. are there only 3 "aspects" of the book, height, width, depth? is there not also time? and a particular H, W, and D? The Trinity is Tri-une. Not composed of lesser disposable parts, like in a book where the H, W, or D can change. I would recommend reading St. Augustine's "On the Trinity", Richard of St. Victor's "On the Trinity," and St. Thomas Aquinas, Summa Theologica 1.27-43 (that's Part One, Questions 27-43). Or, if you'd prefer a prose treatise by my friend getting his PhD. at Oxford on Ockham and the Trinity, I can forward you his recent essay exegeting the Aquinas mentioned above.    It is possible that I do not understand this person because I do not understand the point of view fully.    Moving on.  I am still a little bit curious about how these opinions are formed, and I would really like to compose a rebuttal, but I do not want to cause any hard feelings or make anyone angry.  I think it would be really interesting to have a discussion about this with her.  I am not looking to convert her or change her views in any way, again, just looking for intelligent discussion.  Sometimes it seems that we, as LDS persons, live in a Mormon vacuum - with no religious discussion outside of the church.  This is not a bad thing necessarily, but it is OK to hear the opinions of others sometimes (this is not an open invite to read or listen to anti-Mormon literature - avoid that like the plague).  Any suggestions??  Should I just let it go?    Stuff I have come up with:   urlLink Matt 3:13-17    urlLink John 14:6-10  (I think that scripture could be used as an argument for the trinity idea.   urlLink Acts 7:55-56    urlLink D & C 76:20-24    urlLink Godhead  - in True to the Faith, a church publication

						   So, I am a mental case.  (Yes, I am sure that you already figured that out)  Yesterday, after Sacrament meeting, I got up to go to RS, and sitting a few rows behind me was a guy I hadn't seen before.  He was deliciously cute, and he was making eye contact.  I looked back, but after a second, I looked away.  I could still feel him looking at me, so I looked back, and there he was, eye contact again.    I would like to say that I stopped and talked to him, said something fantastically witty and charming, and now we are going out on Friday night.  However, I was a chicken and kept on walking.  I did see him at the linger longer, but he was talking to a couple of guys, and I didn't feel comfortable walking up to him at that point.  I would have hung out and chatted with people until I had a chance to talk to him, but I didn't.  I can't give an explanation.     Ok, here is my question:  Why aren't people easier to read?  I don't think I would be so nervous to talk to this guy if I was sure that he actually intended to make eye contact, or if he was just zoning out and I misread.  So basically, I have been dying of curiosity about it.  If I see him tonight, I will definitely talk to him and get this out of my mind - it has already occupied enough of my time.  Argh!  Oh, by the way.  It occurred to me that my sarcasm wasn't clear in one of Friday's posts.  My ego is not that huge... that was sarcasm in it's purest form.

						   Ok, I have nothing of import to convey today... hence the random links and quizzes.  (peeve of the day - people who either have excessive typos or type blogs like they would a text message)   urlLink This guy  is strangely intriguing.  I am curious to see what he writes about next.  I think my dog needs a  urlLink website .  As soon as I get a picture, she will have one.    My sunburn finally doesn't hurt, but I am  urlLink molting .   I have said before that I am addicted to Pioneer Quest on PBS.  Last night, the Treadways moved into their new cabin.  When asked if he would miss living in a tent, Tim said "Negatory!"  I about fell out of my seat I laughed so hard.  You had to be there I guess.  I think I am going to go get some pictures scanned this weekend.  The world needs to know what my dog and some of my friends look like.  Also, I hate those Peppersauce Cave pictures of myself.  I think I need an amazingly, drop-dead gorgeous picture of myself for the internet to behold.  Hold your breath, internet.  Here I come. (Yes, I know.  There are some phone camera pictures on my textamerica page... but ain't nobody wants to look up my nose.)

						   I woke up this morning, at 3am according to my watch, because I had too much fluids with dinner.  Yay!  3.5 hours left for sleeping.  So, I went back to bed, settle in, and happen to look up at the one of the clock beside my bed (there are two).  It says 5:15.  Wha??  So I check out the other clock... yep, 5:18.    My $8 Walmart watch lasted a year.  I think I got my money's worth out of that watch, and I have decided to write a eulogy.   oh, cheap, off-brand watch, you have served me well! i know that you were not a swatch, but you kept better time than my dell.  i will miss thy silver band that didn't even turn my arm green! you were scraped and scratched at my demand! you even participated in the movement of the latrine!    you spelunked you biked you did the chicken that funked you hiked  so, with sadness i rehash that a new battery costs more than you. so i have thrown you in the trash. i think maybe i will get a new one in blue...

						   Mostly because I have nothing better to do while I am at work, I find and read blogs all day.  Sometimes I mix it up with a random website, but its pretty much strictly blogs.    Today, Bob of  urlLink Sons of Mosiah  wrote a compelling  urlLink entry on Sins .  Interesting, partly because I have recently discovered that cable miraculously comes into my house for free.  I did not arrange this, or ask for it, I just decided one day to plug the TV into the cable jack to see if it would make the reception better.  It did, and for a couple of months, we had the regular local channels and TBS.  I was happy.  (TBS has good movies)  Then, the other day, I was rewinding a movie, and flipping through the channels using the VCR, and the channels went up higher than they normally do... and still came in clear.  A happy accident on my part.  So, my evenings are now consumed with various combinations of movies, TLC, HGTV, the Discovery Channels... etc.    What a huge waste of time.  (I do have to defend myself by saying that on the commercials, I clean house.  The house is spotless now.  All I have left to do is scrub the shower and vacuum the front rooms... Jobs for tonight.)  I am pretty sure that hour upon hour of Law and Order and In a Fix are probably not how HF wants me to spend my time... especially when my scripture study is seriously lagging.    I heard somewhere that it takes three weeks to make a habit stick.  I beg to differ.  I think it can take 5 minutes sometimes... and 10 years others.  Life is frustrating.    Ok, I am curious what other people do to make sure that they get their scripture study time in??  Comment away people.

						   Ok, so I have this site meter on here, as most people do, that tells me how many people show up to my site, how they got here, and how long they stay.  I have decided to post a few of the more interesting ways people came here, newest first:  Google -  urlLink retarded LDS  (I think they found what they were looking for)  Alltheweb -  urlLink chonies   Google/Blogspot -  urlLink mechanical engineer site   Google -  urlLink retarded geese   Yahoo -  urlLink chonies   Google -  urlLink "ran over her toes"   Google -  urlLink visiting teaching conferences lds   (umm... maybe  urlLink LDS.org  would be a better place for that)  Google -  urlLink pictures of Italian boys   Google -  urlLink ntbk   Google -  urlLink girls are funny   Google -  urlLink manhungry   AOL Search -  urlLink cheek hug   Google -  urlLink girls in toilet  ... nope.  Not here.  On, maybe.  Not in.  Google -  urlLink toilet bowl art    Anyway, that is interesting (and believe me, I censored a lot of it), but I like the referrals from my friends  urlLink Ryan ,  urlLink Sarah , and  urlLink William  the best.  Thanks guys!

						   I received this lovely letter in my email this morning.  I have posted it here it in it's entirety in leiu of forwarding the email on.   HOW TO DUMP A MAN:    Dear ________, I regret to inform you that you have been eliminated from further contention as Mr. Right. As you are probably aware, the competition was exceedingly tough and dozens of well-qualified persons such as yourself also failed to make the final cut. I will, however, keep your name on file should an opening become available. So that you may find better success in your future romantic endeavors, please allow me to offer the following reason(s) you were disqualified from the competition.   (Check those that apply...)   ___Your last name is objectionable. I can't imagine taking it, hyphenating it, or subjecting my children to it.   ___Your first name is objectionable. It's just not something I can picture myself yelling out in a fit of passion.   ___The fact that our dining experiences to date has left MY wallet a little lighter, and YOUR pants a little tighter.   ___Your inadvertent admission that you "buy condoms by the truckload" indicates that you may be interested in me for something other than my personality.    ___You failed the 20 Question Rule, i.e., I asked you 20 questions about yourself before you asked me more than one about myself.    ___Your constant e-mailing shows me you have TOO much time on your hands.    ___You're too short. Any son that we produced would inevitably be beaten up repeatedly at recess.    ___You're too tall... I'm developing a chronic neck condition from trying to kiss you.    ___I find your inability to fix my car extraordinarily unappealing.    ___The fact that your apartment has been condemned reveals an inherent slovenliness that I fear is unbreakable.    ___The phrase "My Mother" has popped up far too often in conversation.    ___You still live with your parents.    ___Although I do enjoy the X-Files, I find your wardrobe of Star Trek uniforms a little disconcerting.    ___Your frequent references to your ex-girlfriend lead me to suspect that you are some sort of psychotic stalker.    ___Your ability to belch the alphabet is not a trait that I am seeking in a long-term partner.    ___Your height is out of proportion to your weight. If you should however, happen to gain the necessary 17 vertical inches, please resubmit your application.    ___Somehow I doubt those condoms I found in your overnight bag were really necessary for a successful business trip.    ___I am out of your league, set your sights lower next time.    Sincerely, _________________    Now, I admit that one or two of these options are a little bit harsh... but funny, nonetheless.  There is a guy at my regular Saturday night gig named Ramon... well, he just came for the first time in a couple of months just this past week.  He is Hispanic, doesn't speak English (just a few words), and comes up to just about paradise level on me.  Generally, he would only ask me to dance the Two Step, but this past Saturday, he asked me to dance a swing with him.  I didn't even know that he knew how, but he was so good!  Rarely have I danced with such a talented partner... and if I did, I would be much thinner today.  I have discovered recently that my idea of an ideal man is amazingly close to my parents idea of an ideal man for me.  I am more attracted to those men whom my parents would approve of... or even like.  I must admit that this is a source of significant mental anguish, of course.  But it is true.  This is possibly the reason for TD's untimely demise... my parents would have approved of his education and prospects, but not his personality.  (and nor did I)    And so, my requirements have in fact evolved past "Breathes and doesn't miss the toilet" to "Breathes, can hold a decent conversation, is spiritual (in the  urlLink religious  sense), is intelligent (far more important than looks), has active goals and potential, isn't rude, wears clean clothes, can  urlLink fix stuff  (at least some of the time), pays more often than not (this is negotiable depending on curcumstances and lots of other things), and cleans up after himself when he misses the toilet."  By the way, if you don't know what  urlLink paradise level  is... think of it in terms of  urlLink celestial prowess .  The level of actual paradise value varies for each girl, but tends to be fairly constant for guys... though only a fairly small percentage of guys are actually at the aforementioned " urlLink paradise level ."  Ok, it's a complex, beating about the bush answer... but it is designed to inspire  urlLink thought .

						   Occasionally, life throws you a curveball.  You have this lesson that maybe you learned a long time ago, but before you know it, you are in the midst of learning it again.    I have ranted and complained about my roomate, Melanie, for the last couple of months, but truth be told, I love her dearly, and I am tremendously dissappointed that we are no longer as good of friends as we used to be.  My feelings are a little hurt in the process... and I am sure hers are as well.    I know that this is entirely one sided, but I feel like she ditched me and our other friends for a guy... albeit a great guy, and I think it is really important to maintain a balance.  If you give up all of your favorite passtimes for a guy, then what?  After a while, it seems, you would loose all of your interesting qualities.  I have been a little less tolerant of her little idiosyncracies lately, and maybe she of mine.  And I have tried to give her some space, and I have definitely needed mine - and that is something that maybe we didn't communicate very well to each other.  I know also that we will never have the same friendship that we did before she was married, and that is a huge loss for me.  I hope that it is as big a loss for her (not in a mean way)  I am a little hurt that she didn't invite me to the reception (I don't know if that was on purpose or not).  So, the question is: Do I find out when it is and go?  Do I ignore it and further exacerbate the problem?  Do I just forget it?  Anyway, so she called me last night, wanting to talk.  I didn't answer the phone (it was the house phone, no caller id). (sometimes, I just need to be left alone... see a little further down for my concerns on the subject)  I did, however, call her back on her work phone (I don't have any other number for her).  I left a mostly blubbery message, apologising for my behaviour and telling her how I am feeling.  We shall see what happens.  It will be a few days.  I am a little embarrassed about the blubbing.  So, since Melanie moved on Saturday, I have been SO looking forward to being alone in the house.  Its been almost two years since I lived alone, and I have two weeks to live it up until my sister gets home.  So, my concern is: what happens when/if I get married and have kids?  I will never have the opportunity to spend two weeks in a house by myself.  That scares me a little (ok, a lot).    Maybe, once I get to the point where I am getting married and having kids, I won't want to be alone for two weeks?

						   I have been following the story of Paul Johnson, an employee of the U.S. defense corporation Lockheed Martin, who was kidnapped last weekend from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.  Mr. Johnson, who was 49, had worked in Saudi for 12 years.   The kidnappers released a videotape of Johnson on Tuesday night saying they would kill him within 72 hours unless the Saudi government released all militants in its prisons. The Saudis have rejected the demand.    The group did not set a specific time when the deadline runs out.    The deadline just  urlLink ran out , according to a report by  urlLink MSNBC .    I am saddened by this report, as an innocent life was taken from this earth by religious zealots who believe that western society is to blame for all of their problems.  However, I believe that the Saudi government made the right decision in not allowing the release of hundreds of extremist militants.  I think that the loss of one life in order to save many lives is sometimes necessary.    I also tend to think that a "racial/religious cleansing??" is in order... not unlike  urlLink Sodom  and  urlLink Gomorrah  or  urlLink the   urlLink Jaredites  ( urlLink here  too)... or the people of  urlLink Jerusalem  in  urlLink Nephi's  time... or maybe even in  urlLink Nephi's  (the son of Helaman) time.  Anyway... as you can tell, there is plenty of precedence for such an action.

						   In keeping with the theme I have set for my blog of late, I have two stories.  I am sure that inquiring minds are dying to know.  Many a moon ago (probably 10 years or so ago), I was riding in the truck with my dad.    Ok, I feel the need to give some background information on my dad.  He is former military, very gruff, very anal, and doesn't laugh.  Few things are funny to him.  We were traveling down a fairly hilly, semi-rural road on a bright and sunny morning, and off in the distance we could see a jogger.  Every now and again, we could see this jogger come to the crest of a hill, and as he got closer, it appeared that he was wearing nothing but his shoes and a smile.    Needless to say, I was enthralled.    However, I did not want my dad to think that I was gaping at this seemingly naked runner, so I glanced at dear old dad to see what he was looking at.  Sure enough, dad had caught sight of the so-called streaker.    Trying to stay as aloof about the whole thing as I possibly could, I said "It sure looks like that guy up there is naked."  "Hummph."  At this point, our au natural jogger is getting pretty close, and heck if I am going to miss a show like a nekkid person jogging.    As we came up on the jogger, I discovered that he had, in fact, made sure that the vitals were covered - with a hot-pink g-string.    As soon as I saw this, I just about gave myself whiplash turning my head to look at my dad.    They say that there are few things in this world that are priceless.  The love of a good woman (or man, as the case may be), for example.  I have to say that the look on my dad's face qualified as priceless.  There are honestly no words to describe the sheer disgust and horror that I am sure my dad felt at that moment, when his 14 year old daughter had just seen a man, jogging, wearing nothing but a hot-pink g-string.  It was hilarious.  I will never let him live it down.  Story #2  This one isn't as funny, but it still has to do with men wearing thongs, so I feel the need to include it.  A few years back, when the Backstreet Boys were still popular, the local radio station (in Tucson) was holding a contest for concert tickets.  The point of this contest was to do the most radical thing that you could think of, and if the DJ's liked it or thought it was funny, they would give you some tickets.    So, I am driving home from work on an afternoon when they are taking contestants, listening to the radio of course, when this man calls in to the station.  He would like to compete for these tickets.  His girlfriend would 'just die' if he won the tickets.  So far, the DJs aren't too impressed with this guy... I am sure that they had heard this story 500 times already that day.  So they ask him what he would like to do to win these tickets.  The man says, very seriously, "I will run down Oracle (a major road in Tucson) during rush hour wearing nothing but a leopard print thong."  The DJs are only slightly intrigued (I, on the other hand, was trying to devise ways to get my dad onto Oracle during rush hour, just so that I can see that face again.... though, in retrospect, I had already be tainted by the hot pink g-string guy, so it wouldn't have been the same), until the man says something that I will never forget as long as I live.  "...and I am not a small man."  Oh, the pictures that floated through my head.    To this day, I don't know if he won those tickets or even ran down Oracle in nothing but that Leopard print tournequet, but I have always hoped against all hope that my man would someday be willing (though I would not want him to) to do such a thing for me, only because he knew that the outcome would make me happy.  And those are my stories about men wearing thongs.

						   Ok, I just have to state for the record that I love, l-o-v-e, love  urlLink dooce .  Our bowels were definitely formed in the same mold, though mine do not require coffee to get started in the morning (the bowl of bran cereal does it for me).     ... ok, two posts so far today #1: underwear, #2: bathroom function (or lack thereof). I have issues, serious issues.  Of those potential husbands mentioned in #1, 99.99999% of them are completely turned off my my anal-retentive crassness and propensity for talking about it ALL THE TIME.

						   Ok, so I get this email this morning from an old, old, old friend.  (and when I say old, I mean young and gorgeous and beautiful).  I sent her a link to this place because we hadn't talked in a while and she was curious about my (non-existent) love life. Anyway, here is what she said (edited only slightly):   hey - that was great!  you should look into a career as a comedic writer!  Although, what exactly are chonies?  And, the title thongs?!  Get me all excited and then let me down!!!  I thought you had finally made the ever so necessary graduation to the g-string.  oh well, in time it will come.  well gotta go now...   Thanks, girl.  You know, now that I am going to use the knowledge that someone thinks I am funny to take over the world.  BWAHAHAH... oh, ahem, excuse me. (I am shameless)    Ok, for those of you who don't know what chonies are: underwear, generally of the grandma/huge variety.  Yes, I wear Nana chonies, for those of you who hadn't already figured that out.  Sorry about the title 'Thongs.'  That was another shameless attempt at sucking you in to reading the post.  (heck, I thought it was funny).    I guess this would be as good a time as any to tell you that I am never going to graduate to g-strings.  It's just not going to happen (for reasons other than the fact that I would look like a marshmallow with a rubberband around it).  Sorry, potential husbands out there, if you don't like the chonies I wear now, thats just too bad because they are permanent.  In any case, if you don't like them, I don't think I can classify you as a potential husband anyway... reasons obvious to those in the know.    ... and that was another post on underwear.

						   Ok, so I occasionally mess up.  These mess ups don't generally affect anyone but me, but they still affect me a great deal.  Sometimes, it seems as if I don't have control of myself and what I do... like I know that what I am doing is the wrong thing, and I really badly don't want to do it, but I still do.  And that is incredibly frustrating.  And I don't know what to do about it.  argh.  Thing two: So, I am at work, leaning over some boxes (trying to figure out who they belong to) when this guy walks by and says, "hey, Granny."  Yeah, my chonies were showing.  This guy is not LDS.  How did he know that what was showing was my chonies?  And really, to call attention to my underwear showing... how inappropriate.  A few Sundays ago, I was sitting on the couch, wearing a long shirt to cover the chonies, reading.  The front door was open, but the iron security door was closed (it was nice outside).  Melanie's Dan came to the door, and even though I knew that he could see me, I wouldn't let him in (due to sitting there in my underwear).  I think Melanie was insulted, but what was I going to do?  I had three options.  Stay where I was and keep the damage to a minimum, let him come in and extend the damage, or get up and walk into my room also extending the damage, because the shirt wasn't long enough to cover all of the chonie that shows.  (by the way, I did not know that he was coming over before church on a Sunday.  Why would he?)  Which makes me think:  is it inappropriate of me to wander around my house in my chonies (big picture window in the front room... but very little to no activity in the front yard)?  Is it inappropriate for my roommate or other girlfriends to see me in my chonies?     Geez... I talk about my underwear a lot.  That is probably inappropriate also.    I have a lot of room for improvement.

						   If I have one lasting love in my life so far besides family, food and my dog, it would be flip flops.  I love em.  I have about 15 different pairs, and it is definitely a good thing that I live in Arizona where I can wear them comfortably almost year round. My feet get very unhappy when they are hot, which in turn makes me cranky (I think my body's temperature guage is in my feet).  I actually can't remember the last time I wore whole shoes to work - though I did force my feet into some real shoes for church on Sunday (first time in a very long time).  So, needless to say, my feet tend to get a little gnarly.  I take measures: pumice, lotion, the occasional pedicure, etc., but at the end of the day, my feet are generally pretty gross.  That would come from living where it is dusty and dry.    The other day at Institute, I was sitting next to Derek during the lecture.  I had one foot on the other knee when I noticed that my feet were particularly gross.  Unfortunately for me, Derek noticed as well.  He leaned over to me and said "Your feet look like my mom's, and she is old!  You know, it's a bad thing when your feet are more disgusting than your husband's."  Thanks Derek.

						   Two things about my day so far that more than qualify as TMI:  1.  I ran out of tops (must do laundry), which leaves me to suffer the day away in the one that was left in the back corner of the drawer: mesh.  For you girls that haven't tried mesh, the bottoms are great, but the tops are cut weird.  Hence, uncomfortableness all day.  But it was either that or a one-piece - and the one-piece gives me a wedgie (something that I gladly left behind with 'regular' undies... been thinking I should buy a 'tall?').  My favorite is the new fabric they have: Dri-Lux.  Spectacularly comfortable, even when it is hot as heck outside.  I recommend.    2.  I just yanked out the longest, most disgusting hair from my chin.  Ew.  Why?  Why do I have a long hair growing from my chin area?  I am a girl, and I am not old!    The other day, for enrichment night, we went to the Phoenix Art Museum.  Since we had to carpool over there, a girl I didn't know rode with me.  I was nearly knocked over when I noticed that this girl had a 5 o'clock shadow!  We aren't talking your normal 'slightly dark on the upper lip' or 'a single blonde hair sprouting from the chin area' girl facial hair here, we are talking 'hasn't shaved in a while' STUBBLE!    What the heck?!    I understand that this poor girl was cursed with an excess of facial hair.  Stuff like that happens.  It's all about genetics.  But what would posess her to  shave   it off???  Why would any girl shave her face?!?!  Seriously, that is why bleach, waxing, and tweezers were invented!  Didn't her mother tell her that shaving your face (or anywhere above the underarm area) is an absolute no-no?  Have you ever seen a commercial on TV or seen any facial shaving products in the market for women?  I think not!  They sell the aforementioned bleach, wax, and tweezers for such an occasion!!  Most importantly, how does she explain this 5 o'clock shadow to a man that she is dating when he complains that he has recieved a beard burn?  Now there is an uncomfortable topic.  I dare say more awkward than a premature DTR.    So, I say to you, girl in my ward and all other women who for some reason have used a razor above the underarm area, STOP IT!  Stop it right now!  I know it's hard, but put down that razor, buy some bleach and wax, and start using it!  Immediately, if not sooner!  Let's cut that whole 'beard burn' situation/conversation off at the pass.  The sooner you stop shaving, the sooner that hair can be waxed.

						   So, I am in Tucson for the afternoon, visiting my family.  I can't wait for dinner!  Homecooked, good food that I didn't make myself!  Yay!  I was sustained for my new calling, which is Temple Prep Teacher... again, totally inadequate for the job.  The other temple prep teacher is Josh.  Tall, good-looking, great dancer.  Turns out that he suggested me for the job.  Maybe this will lead to good things.  I think he is going to go dancing with me next weekend too.  Yay.  I saw "Bridget Jones' Diary" for the first time in two years on Saturday night (edited version, on tv).  Seriously, it should be required viewing for all men.  What woman doesn't want to be told that a man likes her "just the way she is."  This would be added to the list that already contains "Kate and Leopold," and "Shallow Hal."  Rent away, boys.

						   There was a period in my life in which I spent a lot of time on  urlLink ICQ .  Probably not the healthiest social time of my life, but whatever.  At the time, I had a wild and crazy roommate who also used ICQ (among other things) in excess.    This particular roomate, whom I will call Beth (because that is her name), spent an inordinate amount of time talking to a guy from Italy (presumably).  After Beth and this guy had spent an appropriate amount of time chatting, they decided to exchange pictures.  As Beth did not have a picture of herself scanned, and this was before the age of widespread digital camera use, Beth and I rumiated for days on how to satiate this young man's curiosity.    Since this Italian man's picture was of the 'wow, he's hot.' variety (I still have suspicions that the picture was pawned from the internet somewhere, but Beth thinks that it was actually him, in all his Italian Stallion glory), I came to the conclusion that he was probably hoping that he had been chatting with some nude or semi-nude playboy-esque type girl... so we decided to see what would happen when she turned out to be the antithesis of this so-called Hooter's girl.    Side note:  I don't know when I turned evil.  It just happened one day.  I think it was probably in some public school somewhere, in a time where they did not belive that actual stimulation of the brain cells was entirely necessary.  So my brain cells decided that they needed to stimulate themselves by thinking up creative ways to make fun of people.  Over the years, I have learned to harness this creativity in less harmful, yet equally funny ways.    Back to the story:  So I found a quite flattering (if I say so myself) photograph of the lovely and beguiling Janet Reno, saved it to disk, and sent it to our unsuspecting Italian gentleman, with the fairly educated guess that he had never seen this particular beautiful woman before.  I had Beth's permission, of course.  A few moments after I sent said picture, our Italian friend responds with a "Hum, you are a little older than I pictured...."  Then a few minutes of small talk, and a "You know, I think I'm late for work.  Gotta run."    Our story does have a happy ending, even after my evil act.  We came up with a (real) picture of Beth a few days later, and much to Italian boy's relief, she is pretty hot (though she would probably need a boost if she wanted to be a Hooter Girl).    The moral:  Abusing the sensitivities of unsuspecting Italian men probably isn't very nice, but it sure is funny.

						   So, Renada just sent me this quote:   You don't have to pretend in front of a friend.  Renada's addition: "Yeah, but you do have to pretend that you are normal long enough to get a friend."  Touche.    So, guess who has a new calling?  Guess who is just about the least qualified person in the whole world for said calling, possibly ever?    Yeah, it's me. More information on what this calling is later on - probably Monday.  Suffice it to say that my partner in this new calling is someone that I have blogged about before, and yes, it's a good thing.    I just heard that Ray Charles passed away today.  My heart goes out to his family and anyone who was ever influenced by his music - which would be everyone. He will be missed.  And while I am on the subject:  I never voiced my response to Ronald Reagan's passing.  While unfortunately not untimely, President Reagan's death certainly came as a shock.  Even through his crippling illness, the man seemed immortal.  It is hard to say goodbye to possibly the greatest President to hold office in these United States, and it is beautiful that even in death, he has been able to bring the country together and create at least a spark of patriotism in these dark times of war and wickedness.  I can't wait to talk to him in the spirit world, as he is one of my heros in mortality.

						   So, I was walking in to work this morning, when it hit me.  I am retarded!    So, I have been hard up for money lately – almost to the point of serious destitution.  And really, I am too nice sometimes.  I lent my last $30 to a friend the other day, and she hasn’t paid me back yet.  So the night after I gave the last of my money away, I notice that a tire on my car is a little bit low.    No big deal, I think.  I will just take it to a service station in the morning and put some air in it, all is good.    Next morning arrives, I get ready for work, walk out to my car.  Low and behold, that sucker is flat.  Flat, flat.  Like no driving on it anymore flat.  A few expletives came to mind, but none emerged from the lips.    It is my good fortune that I own a bike.  A pretty good bike, I might add.  So I decide to ride said bike to work, which is about 5 miles away, something that I did all winter but stopped doing when it got warm out.    I must say that riding a bike 5 miles when it is 82 degrees outside (morning) is much different than riding a bike 5 miles when it is 100 degrees out (evening).    Needless to say, I was pooped, hot, and sweaty when I got home.  But the instant I walked in the door, Melanie told me that  urlLink Derek  had just called and that he was coming over to be my knight in shining armor.  Yay!  Melanie also had dinner ready, which she offered me – double Yay!  So, a little backtracking.  I took a Pre-Calculus class last semester, for which I have a book that the bookstore refused to buy back from me (Punks!).  Recently, a professor in the department that I work for asked me if I had any math or science books that I wanted to sell him – again, Yay!  So, I sold him a Physics book and I told him about said Calc book.  Since then, he has asked me every time I see him about this calc book – we are talking every day for at least a couple of weeks here.    Enter me, the retarded person.  Hello.  I am hard up for money, yet I refuse to remember to bring in this stupid book so that this professor can give me money for it.  Duh.

This is including, but not limited to, those persons whom I: spend entire weekends with, call when I am bored or lonely, conspire with to leave toilets on people's doorsteps (we gotta do that again girl!), and plan whirlwhind roadtrips with.  That said, sure you bug me now and again.  I am certain that I bug you at times as well.  Its all good.  That is part of life.

						   You ever have a friend that is just so whiney and obsessed with her ailments/problems that you just want to say "Shut Up already!  It happened X days/years/months ago.  Get over it!"  I worry that I am that friend sometimes, but then I realize that there can only be one of those in any given group of friends, and that job is already taken up by someone else.  So a couple of weekends ago, this particular friend and I went on an outing with another good girlfriend and a couple of guys, and this friend talked about a past ailment in excess while we were all trapped in a small car.  If I were a dude, she would be off my list of available chicks instantly.  Since then, I have noticed how much she talks about past stuff.  She tells EVERYONE about this problem.  So this weekend, I lost my voice.  It's actually still gone, but its all good.    I had a sore throat all last week, and it has just progressed downward.  Saturday night, I went out with the girls, and I knew that I was going to loose it at some point.  When I woke up on Sunday, speaking was a thing from the past.  There was just nothing left, and it actually hurt/hurts to talk.  So I stayed in all day and rested the throat.  Its actually been kindof fun, not speaking.  And it has been a learning experience.  Over the last two days, I have had to think more about what I say... mostly to condense it down to as few words as possible.  Needless to say, thinking before speaking is not something that I am known for.  We shall see how long it lasts.  Saturday night, the girls and I decided that the dance was a complete bust, so we went to downtown Tempe to people watch.  I will not take 4 girls people watching in the future, because it is way too obvious... and I will probably never go people watching with Renada again (she is WAY too obvious... she stares at people), but it was SO FUN!!  People watching is a fine art, and it has to be really casual (Renada was too intense).    My trick is to sit at a window table and talk to a girlfriend.  When an interesting guy walks by, I look him straight in the eye and continue to look even after he looks back, all while maintaining my conversation.  It's harder than it sounds... and it is especially hard to do without looking completely weird.  Of course, it's important to keep a pleasant look on your face.  Saturday night, I got a guy to hold eye contact with me and turn his head all the way around while he walked by... almost running into something.  I was actually suprised that he didn't come back by, because I was exceedingly forward.  It made me feel much better about myself... I have been feeling rather un-cute lately.  Note: this tactic doesn't seem to work on LDS guys for some reason.  Anyway... this isn't an advice book, and I suspect that I am revealing my secrets to the enemy.  Use this information wisely, guys.

						    .    I love it.  As I am sure you have noticed, there is a recurring theme in my blog of late: aliens abducting my cat.        Kidding.  That would actually be the extreme, unbearable, I think I might melt, heat.  I cannot promise that this will be my last post about it, as the summer has only just begun, but I will attempt to keep my sufferage to myself after this.    Today, just now in fact, I was forced to make a trek across campus to get a bite to eat, as the 'Oasis Cantina,' aka the 'Roach Coach' was closed for the afternoon.  Since I was famished, and I refuse to eat from vending machines on moral grounds, I gritted my teeth, applied more deodorant, prepared my eau de toilette (to cover the stench, French style), and started my hike.  As I set out, sheilding my eyes from the extreme glare of the afternoon sun, mine eyes beheld a woman of Middle Eastern descent on a bicycle, riding in my general direction.  She was wearing the tradition garb of a person of her ethnic persuasion, the name of which escapes me at the moment, which involves a linen tunic that goes to the knees that is worn with matching linen pants.  This garb always looks very comfortable to me, as linen is cooler than other fabrics, but this particular woman was wearing an interesting accessory: a jacket.  A jacket, people!  Its 111 degrees out there!  What is she thinking??  She looked perfectly comfortable too.  Looks like I am moving.  I have spent the day looking for someone to move in with, and I am not having much luck.  I did, however, talk to a girl that lives way out in the boonies that has a brand new home, rent is in my price range.  It looks good, and I have a good feeling.  Wish me luck in the house hunt!!

						   I just found  urlLink Grace's  site, which has more than a few good points.    I was laying in bed last night, trying to sort things out,  flipping through a  urlLink hymnbook , when I came across " urlLink I Know That My Redeemer Lives ."  I have read this hymn a thousand times, it's one of my favorites, but the second verse really hit me: 'He lives to hear my soul's complaint.  He lives to silence all my fears.  He lives to wipe away my tears.  He lives to calm my troubled heart.'  What am I doing here, wallowing in terrible feelings.  There is someone out there who has already experienced this and wants to take it all away.  The problem now is just to let it all go, easier said than done.  I also just discovered  urlLink KZION  - LDS Internet Radio.  Very nice.  No commercials.  And how great to have the privilege of listening to contemporary LDS music at work... which tends to be a den of iniquity (yeah, that goes without saying, I work for a State University.)  On that note, I love Ryan Shupe & The RubberBand's "Two Year Old Attitude," which I just heard on the aforementioned KZION.  Hilarious.  So... on a completely different topic, many moons ago... somewhere around Thanksgiving of last year (that fateful holiday in which I was forced to bring Bryant home to 'meet the parents'), I got an impression, completely out of the blue - but while I was on my knees, that I already know the person that I am supposed to... well... "the one."  (this will henceforth be referred to as 'the wierd prompting')  At the time, I was just floating along, not sure where I was going with life, and not really seeing/dating anyone (yeah, that Bryant thing was crazy... more on that later, maybe).  I was also not too worried about my love life/future (and I am still not... despite the occasional complaint about guys general lack of initiative) .  I was/am convinced that Heavenly Father has a plan for everyone, and its our job to just live it out in the best way we can, listening to the spirit, and doing what is right.    So, why was I given this piece of information?  Did it actually come from Heavenly Father, or was it me... or worse, was it Satan?  Why is it so hard to tell sometimes?  I know that Satan's promptings are generally repeated several times, but sometimes I still have trouble distinguishing  my   thoughts from the promptings of the spirit.    Anyway, I have kindof let it sit in the back of my mind, but I haven't worried about it too much, aside from the occasional "who could it be?"    Why bring this up now?  I don't know.  It just came to mind when I talked to this guy (R) this morning on the phone.  I don't know him very well, but R is a student in the department that I work for, is LDS, goes to a different ward, and has a GREAT phone voice.  And now that I think about it, last time I saw him I thought about the weird prompting, and I did meet him prior to the weird prompting.  Where is this stuff coming from?!  Is this pure retarded Lyndsay, or is this genuine?  This girl is confused, disfunctional, and generally messed up lately, and feeling completely unworthy of spiritual insight on this subject.

						   A dollar to anyone who can name the song that the above title comes from... and it's appropriate "definition."  It is danged hot outside.  I happened to stop at the restroom in the biology building today during my many travels around campus.  This particular restroom has a thermometer in it.  The thermometer read a brisk 68 degrees (F).  This means that there is a  40 degree  difference between inside and outside today.  I reside in a place better known as "the firey pits of the devil."  Incidentally,  urlLink ASU's  mascot is a Sun Devil.  Fitting.  I found this quote that I enjoy immensely:   I cannot help but notice that there is no problem between us that cannot be solved by your departure.    or mine.

						   Hymn #124: Be Still My Soul  1. Be still, my soul: The Lord is on thy side; With patience bear thy cross of grief or pain. Leave to thy God to order and provide; In ev'ry change he faithful will remain. Be still, my soul: Thy best, thy heav'nly Friend Thru thorny ways leads to a joyful end.  2. Be still, my soul: Thy God doth undertake To guide the future as he has the past. Thy hope, thy confidence let nothing shake; All now mysterious shall be bright at last. Be still, my soul: The waves and winds still know His voice who ruled them while he dwelt below.  3. Be still, my soul: The hour is hast'ning on When we shall be forever with the Lord, When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone, Sorrow forgot, love's purest joys restored. Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past, All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.  Text: Katharina von Schlegel, b. 1697; trans. by Jane Borthwick, 1813-1897

						   This weekend, I went to floating on the Salt River (Very fun) and then went to Kingman, Az to help Renada move (not so much).  I also planned and executed the funniest thing I have ever participated in.    After work on Friday, I went to the DI (Deseret Industries Thrift Store) and bought a used toilet, which I transported home in the back seat of my Honda Civic Sedan.    Then I met up with Renada and we hauled the commode out of my car (its HEAVY!), sprayed it down with Lysol and the hose, then went to Wal-Mart and got some candy.  Then we dried and loaded the toilet back into the car and drove over to our friend Darla's apartment.    Here is where it got really fun:  It was about 12:30am.  Darla's apartment is in the GHETTO, and it was crawling with shifty looking people (I got cat-called!), and it was really noisy.  We scoped the place out to find Darla's apartment.  We figured that we would have to be quick because of all the people roaming around and because there were a couple of security guards on bikes roaming around.  Our biggest forseeable problem was people bothering us and giving us grief as we transported the toilet to Darla's doorstep... but we didn't have any problems with that, and in fact, a woman helped us with the gates.  She didn't even bat an eye at the toilet or ask any questions.   Anyway, Darla lives on the second floor.  Renada about broke down in snorting laughter with only two steps to go, so we got scared that we woke Darla up and ran to hide.  Amazingly, we didn't wake her, so we proceeded.  We placed the toilet right by Darla's door, then we put an old Santa in the bowl and positioned a roll of toilet paper in one of his hands.  In the other hand he held a bell, which we filled with candy, then we put the rest of the candy in the tank with a little note explaining ourselves.  We taped the poem (see below) to the front of the bowl.   Since Darla was our toilet pass-along guinea pig, Renada and I worried that she wouldn't take the toilet in the spirit that it was intended, so we swung by her apartment on Saturday to see if she had seen it.  Darla was outside by her car with a friend (Lori), so I slowed down to talk to her, rolled the widown down, then changed my mind and sped off, worried that Darla or Lori had seen us. (She hadn't, which is amazing because I practically ran over her toes as I drove by).  Sunday at church, Renada and I were searching for Darla when she walked by, oblivious to our prescence.  I grabbed her arm, to which I got an immediate smile.  (phew!!)  The first thing out of Darla's mouth was "So, I got a toilet."    It was a huge success!  I had a blast planning and executing, and it made someone feel good to get it (even if it is a used toilet).  The great thing about the toilet is that no one wants it, so it will be passed on to the next person quickly.  I hope that people continue this tradition... and I, for one, plan on starting at least one more toilet.  The poem:   Alas!  A toilet!  You have been bestowed With a (gently) used commode  Don’t come undone It’s all in fun (and it weighs a ton!)  Where did it come from? A very ‘cheeky’ chum (Whose code word is ‘mum’)  What is the point? Well… it is you we chose to appoint  To refill the throne with care And pass it to friend most fair  So her day’s more silly And possibly a little bit frilly (especially if you include a lily)  We filled this stool with a weird Santa And bag of chocolate the size of Montana  So choose your prey Without delay  Move this potty Using your muscles from Karate (or yoga, as the case may be)  Do it in the dead of night You wouldn’t want to give a fright (or maybe you just might!)  Take it to your friend’s abode Using your nearest paved road  Leave it full of goodies and a little note If you return it to me, I want a pleasure boat (but it probably won’t fit in this can’s moat)  If you require assistance moving this can, May I suggest enlisting the help of a man?   And the note that I wrote to Darla in explanation:   Darla –   You have been designated the inaugural receiver of this toilet!  I have wanted to start a toilet pass-around for a long time, and it’s finally getting started.    The goal is to brighten the day of a girlfriend by filling the toilet with anything you can think of and then leave it in a friend’s yard or on their porch for them to find.  You can use the poem that I wrote and just add a note, or you can think up something on your own.  Be creative!  This is all about fun.  The only thing I ask is that you keep the toilet within the girls of our ward – and that you will let whomever you pass it on to know this.    Why a toilet?  Cause its funny.  Who would think that they would wake up some morning to find a toilet in the yard?  On to the good stuff…   We love you, Darla!  You are beautiful and so fun to hang around with.  Every time we talk, I learn something new that I didn’t think of before.  We hope that we were successful in brightening your day a little bit with this weird Santa (check out his belly button ring!) and this chocolate.   Have a spectacularly wonderful day!!  See you on Sunday.  Much love,    The Two Blondes

						    I am so tired of temp agencies.&nbsp; I have an appointment this afternoon that I thought was with a financial company, but in reality is with yet another temp agency.&nbsp; Between that one and the one I rescheduled from Friday, my total is now 6.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp; Does no one direct hire anymore?&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Ok, I admit to my bad attitude.&nbsp; I will go to the interviews and be charming.    &nbsp;  So, yeah.&nbsp; I suppose I am grumpy this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Its possibly due to the fact that I have a hard time sleeping in my house.&nbsp; If the pervy guy's goal was to make me afraid to&nbsp;be in my own home, then he succeeded beautifully.&nbsp; I decided yesterday to have the place rededicated.&nbsp; I know of a surety that I will be protected by the power of the dedicatory prayer, combined with the 'shield and protection' that my garments provide and a nightly prayer requesting a bubble of protection around my house.&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Evil is strong...&nbsp;and sometimes it presses at the windows to get in.&nbsp; (and sometimes it opens the window&nbsp;and just walks right in).    &nbsp;  Crap.&nbsp; Just sent a resume with the wrong job title in the cover letter... and didn't change the name from "to whom" to the correct name... crap.&nbsp; I probably had an actual chance at that one.&nbsp; (ldsjobs.com)    &nbsp;  Oh, and another temp agency just called.&nbsp; I see them on Wednesday.&nbsp; My question to you sir, is if my resume is so "excellent" then why don't I have any serious offers on the table?&nbsp;     &nbsp;   &nbsp;   &nbsp;  I am a little off today.&nbsp; I have no wittiness in me.&nbsp; I am going to go get something to eat.    &nbsp;  &nbsp;

						   Nothing looked amiss as I walked in the door this afternoon.&nbsp; Maybe I thought Melissa was home, even though that wasn't possible - mostly because her car was not in it's spot.&nbsp; I yell for her to see if she is in her room.&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like someone&nbsp;is in the house - but no, that isnt possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Say&nbsp;hi to&nbsp;the dog, then&nbsp;dump my&nbsp;stuff and go&nbsp;back to my bedroom to change my clothes and take a little pit stop.&nbsp; My bathroom pocket door is almost all of the way closed, which I didn't do... but maybe Melissa used my curling iron or something.&nbsp; Weird, though.  When I&nbsp;am finished&nbsp;back there, I walk back out to the front room to make myself something to eat and sit on the couch to watch TV for a bit before I going to my appointment.&nbsp; About 4 bites into lunch, I hear the pocket door close again and then a loud&nbsp;crash like something fell.&nbsp; I yell for Melissa, my voice growing more and more frantic every time.&nbsp; She must be home - maybe she took her car to the shop and walked home or something. &nbsp;On the verge of panic, I walk into my room to discover the pocket door almost closed again.&nbsp; That is strange.&nbsp; Pushing it open, I discover the bathroom curtains blowing in the breeze.&nbsp;   Police.&nbsp; Police.&nbsp; Don't panic.&nbsp; Where is my phone?&nbsp; Crap.&nbsp; Where did I leave it?&nbsp; Police.&nbsp; Police is under M for Mesa.&nbsp;   "Hello, Mesa Police."  "My name is Lyndsay, and someone was just in my house."  "Where are you?&nbsp; I am sending an officer right now."  "I am in my living room, freaking out. My address is ...."  "The officer will be there in 30 seconds. Go outside in your front yard and wait for him.&nbsp; What do you look like?&nbsp; What color shirt are you wearing?"  "Blonde, Black shirt, jeans."  "Are they there yet?"  "No."  "I show them in the area.&nbsp; They will be there in just a moment."  "Oh, I see them."  "ok, I am going to disconnect now."  I see the police officer stick his head around the corner of the end unit.&nbsp; I am not sure if it is really a cop, since I can't see his uniform, but I walk toward him anyway.&nbsp; He is near the street, and I am telling you that I can absolutely outrun him right now - adrenaline is a powerful drug.&nbsp; oh, yeah.&nbsp; I am barefoot.&nbsp; Maybe I can't.&nbsp; Pain really is no object right now.  Ok, he is a cop... and holy crap, there are about 15 of them.&nbsp; And one of them is holding a sniper rifle.&nbsp; This is serious business.&nbsp; Oh, wow.&nbsp; There are more in the neighbor's backyards... and some across the street.&nbsp;   "No, there is absolutely no one on this planet that should be in my house right now."  "No, I haven't pissed anyone off.&nbsp; No, I have no angry ex-boyfriends.&nbsp; No, my sister doesn't either."   "No, my dog doesn't bite."  Crap.&nbsp; Why didn't I bring Emma with me when I walked to the cop?&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't realize that this would be so serious.&nbsp; I honestly thought that I would sit around and wait for them to show up for like two hours or something.&nbsp; Can I go back and get my dog?&nbsp; Please don't hurt her!&nbsp;   They want to bring in a dog.&nbsp; Wait, no.&nbsp; No dogs are available right now.&nbsp; I am secretly relieved... mostly because I don't want anything to happen to Emma.&nbsp; Would&nbsp;a police&nbsp;dog hurt her?&nbsp; Will Emma get in the way?&nbsp; That is stupid.&nbsp; They wouldn't let their dog hurt my pet.&nbsp; It would be better because then if someone is in there the dog will find it.&nbsp; But I think the guy left already.  Ok, ok.&nbsp; They got the sheild.&nbsp; They are going in.&nbsp; They look like scared little boys.&nbsp; I think some of these guys are younger than me and I am sure that they are in training.&nbsp; They are drawing their guns.&nbsp; Don't hurt my dog.&nbsp; She will bark a little bit, but don't hurt her.&nbsp;   I might cry, but I don't want to look like a prissy little wimp in front of all these guys.&nbsp; Ok, wait.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; They are coming back.  They didn't find anybody.&nbsp; I didn't think they would.&nbsp; I waited too long to call.&nbsp; I should have called the moment I heard the door and the crash.&nbsp; Crap.&nbsp;   Oh, Melissa is home.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think I can be there by myself right now.&nbsp;   A fingerprint specialist is coming in.&nbsp; Maybe this punk that has been coming into my home through the windows has a record or something.&nbsp; Maybe they will catch him.&nbsp; I kind of want him to do it again, because I sure as heck am going to be smarter about it next time.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am seriously considering getting a concealed weapon's license.&nbsp; The windows are locked now though, so there is no way that he can get inside again.&nbsp; I sort of feel like this person is a phantom or something.&nbsp; I heard it, but it doesn't really exist... Even though I know that&nbsp;he absolutely does exist, and he has come into my house at least 3 times.&nbsp; And this time he almost got caught.  What the heck was this person doing in my house?&nbsp; Why would someone come into the house three times&nbsp;and not take anything?&nbsp; Why were we so stupid as to leave the window unlatched?&nbsp; Did this man watch me go to the bathroom and change my clothes?&nbsp; Was he in my closet?&nbsp; My shower?&nbsp; Under my bed?&nbsp; What would have happened if I came across him?&nbsp; What would he have done if I saw him?&nbsp;I could have been raped!&nbsp; I could have been murdered!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;  There are some sick bastards in this world.&nbsp;   The only thing that I can think of (and my cop friend, Jake, concurs) is that this guy is some disgusting perv that gets off on stealing or rifling though&nbsp;girl's underwear... or maybe he gets off on&nbsp;walking through our&nbsp;house when we aren't there.&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Either way,&nbsp; I am washing every pair of underwear that I own.&nbsp; I am seriously considering destroying them and starting over.&nbsp; How disgusting that some strange person might have touched them.&nbsp; Ew!! And with what in mind?&nbsp;   What is all this?&nbsp; I have lived in this apartment for almost a year.&nbsp; We develop a major roach problem (which seems to have abated, thank goodness and the City of Mesa), I suddenly no longer have a job, and now some perverted jerkoff&nbsp;breaks into my house.&nbsp; What am I to take away from this?&nbsp; Am I supposed to move?&nbsp; (Seriously considering moving... except, of course, I have no job.)  Oy.

						   Resign yourselves to your fate kids, I am going to blab on about the job hunt until I find a new job, at which point, I will blab on about either how good it is or how much it sucks.&nbsp; Lets hope for the former - for your sanity and mine.  Today, I have spent the last 45 minutes or so job-seeking and resume-sending.&nbsp; Honestly, I am a little sick of it.&nbsp; It would really be nice if I got a decent call back out of all this effort.&nbsp; I have applied to at least 70 jobs so far, and I am getting nowhere.  Just now, I sat and applied to about 25 jobs.&nbsp;   Ok, I must digress for a moment.&nbsp; I am sitting in the library.&nbsp; I was in an aisle of computers&nbsp;filled with adults when I sat down, now empty except for two 7 year old girls fighting,&nbsp;whining, and (of course) tattling&nbsp;to their happily oblivious mother who is sitting in another row.&nbsp;   Comeon!&nbsp; We only have 44 minutes left! Its your turn!&nbsp; Its your turn.&nbsp; Mooommmm.... Soandso won't take her turn!  Needless to say of course, they are not leaving my row when they do this, so it is noisy and disruptive.&nbsp; Please don't get me wrong, I absolutely love children and I can't wait to have some of my own someday, but I can't stand whining.&nbsp;   We only have 40 minutes left!&nbsp; Hurry up!&nbsp; Mom!&nbsp; Momm!&nbsp; Soandso is taking too long in her turn!   Especially  in a public place.&nbsp; Parents, I impore you: Control your children.&nbsp; Teach them good manners.&nbsp; And don't let them be noisy in a public place - a library for pete's sake!&nbsp; I understand that children can not be controlled all of the time - they have outbursts, tantrums, etc., but seriously!&nbsp;   Moom!&nbsp; Soandso doesn't want to play anymore!&nbsp; Comeon!&nbsp; Comeon!&nbsp; We only have 38 minutes left.&nbsp; Mom!&nbsp; Soandso is using a color that I don't like!&nbsp; Mom!   Good manners are not diffucult to teach, they just require some time and effort on the part of the parents.&nbsp; It is unacceptable to behave in a constantly disruptive manner in public.&nbsp; By the way, the Mom in question has not spoken a single word this entire time.&nbsp;  Not one .&nbsp; Not even a 'shush .'&nbsp;   OOOOOOooooooo!!&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm telling!!&nbsp;   By now, my mother would have taken us out to the car, and we would have been on the way home, well into a lecture on the many virtues of a library - that is, if we had been disruptive in the first place.  Ok, back to the job stuff.&nbsp; I sent a resume to a company that looked to be hiring.&nbsp; As it turns out, it was a Staffing Agency - and someone from there just called me.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp; I already have applied to several, and I am tired of them.&nbsp; It seems to be a waste of an hour.&nbsp; I generally call them 2 or 3 times a week... to get an "I'll call you when I hear something." response.&nbsp; So, anyway, I have yet another appointment with one this afternoon.  So I have 3 general staffing agencies, one that specializes in title/escrow stuff (yuck - I don't call them), and now this new one this afternoon.&nbsp; I am tired.&nbsp; Tired of this search - it feels like an exercise in futility.  Sudden change of subject imminent.  Lately, I have become one of those "Does it on the outside" Mormons.&nbsp; I am feeling rather unworthy, but I   Whoa!&nbsp; Wait a minute!&nbsp; Mom just said - very quietly - "girls, be quiet."&nbsp;   They ignored her.  Ok, but I can't seem to get it back on track.&nbsp; Satan is winning, I know, but I just can't do it.&nbsp; I feel like I am in suspended animation.&nbsp; There are so many things that I want to do and become, but I am swimming in cement.&nbsp; I know that I can't blame other people but I think that part of it is the stuff that my current roomate has allowed into the house.&nbsp; Bad stuff, negative vibes - total lack of spirit. &nbsp;I won't go into specifics, but I have left the room more than once when she has the TV on - 'Will and Grace' would be the best of the worst.&nbsp; She moves out on the 30th... but honestly, I don't think that will help me much.&nbsp; I am slipping - quickly - and I am feeling like I can't get back to where I was.&nbsp; There was a time where I read my scriptures at work in my free time.&nbsp; Where I made a consious effort to keep the spirit with me.&nbsp; Where I felt good about where I was.&nbsp; Now I don't feel worthy of my temple reccomend.&nbsp;   I just had an ephiphany (Spirit!?).&nbsp; Sometimes Satan works really hard on you - for example, I could really feel how hard he was working on me in the months before I was endowed.&nbsp; I was expecting it.&nbsp; I knew it was coming.&nbsp; I was strong.&nbsp; Recently, I have let my guard down.&nbsp; I wasn't specifically aware of his workings.&nbsp; I have a new calling in which I need to be that strong person that I was before, but I didn't consider the fact that Satan would redouble his efforts!&nbsp; Oh, my goodness, and I let him get me down, and take away all of my pillars of stregnth (prayer, scripture study, every day journal writing... oh goodness, even social stuff like FHE and Saturday night Dances!)&nbsp; I have to wonder if Satan even convinced me that I was unworthy of&nbsp;temple attendance... (now I  know  I have stuff to work on before I go back... )  Ok, now that I figured out what I have been doing wrong, what do I do to get it back on track?&nbsp; It seems so simple, but it is so hard!!&nbsp; I have a serious amount of studying... work... repentance to do.&nbsp;   I think I will begin with a strict media censure... along with the standard dailies (prayer, scriptures, etc).&nbsp;   I'll keep you updated on the progress.&nbsp; I teach on Sunday.&nbsp; eek.

						   I spend too much money for someone with no job.&nbsp; (Mr. Walton personally called me last night to say&nbsp;thank you for making 4 trips to his store yesterday.)   I also have too many projects going, which of course would be related to point #1.&nbsp; (my house is finally mostly cleaned up from the major kitchen project.&nbsp; I only have 87 other projects going though)&nbsp; Last night I made flower pens - which brings me to point #3.   I am at a dry spot in my job search.&nbsp; Nothing coming or going.&nbsp; eek...&nbsp; What happens when the money runs out and I have no job?&nbsp; Scary.   Oh, yeah, and I forgot to&nbsp;write (or didn't have time)&nbsp;yesterday to tell about the actual home teaching session.&nbsp; HTS and comp sat and chatted with me for about an hour, then as they got up to leave, HTS initiated a long hug with a lingering&nbsp;back&nbsp;rub afterward.&nbsp; Again I say unto you: What does this mean?  Sometimes it sucks to be a girl - overanalyzation gets old sometimes, but it must be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please help me!&nbsp;   Love&nbsp;your comments!&nbsp; Keep em coming!&nbsp; It makes my daily email check so enjoyable!&nbsp; (finding nothing in there except junk mail and reject letters is depressing).  &nbsp;

						   I freaking hate computers.&nbsp; I had a great, hilarious post, and the server at the freaking library went down.&nbsp; And now I only have 12 minutes left, and that is not nearly enough time to make this recant as witty as possible.  Ok, my home teacher, whom I have a crush on (and have for a while) called me yesterday afternoon.&nbsp; We chat for a bit, mostly dominated by me telling him about my job hunt and my home improvement projects, when it occurs to me that I am blabbing and he is probably at work...  me thinking:&nbsp; wow, HT is so cute!&nbsp; And so smart!&nbsp; I think he actually is interested in what I have to say!&nbsp; Oh, yeah, and he brought me homemade brownies last week!&nbsp; And he always seeks me out at church!&nbsp; Oh, I gotta rein in this crush.  me saying:&nbsp; "So, I am guessing that you actually called for a reason?"  Him:&nbsp; "Yeah, I was wondering if you are free tonight?"  me thinking: no WAY!&nbsp; yee haw.&nbsp; Ok, girly, don't sound too eager!  me saying: "umm... sure!"  Him:&nbsp; "Comp and I would like to come over tonight and home teach you!&nbsp; How does 6 sound?"  me thinking:&nbsp; bugger!&nbsp; buggerbuggerbuggerbuggerBUGGER!&nbsp; What a let down!&nbsp; I should have expected that!&nbsp; (for the record, I dont think he realized what he did).  me saying:&nbsp; "Sounds great!&nbsp; See you then."  Ok, so I am a mental case!&nbsp;&nbsp;Is HT just a really&nbsp;awesome and caring home teacher, is there a little something there, or both maybe??&nbsp;&nbsp; grr!&nbsp; People really should be much easier to read!

						   (I wonder what kind of google hits I will get with that title?) &nbsp; Anyway, I am sitting here, in the public library, unshowered, unshaven, and maybe just a little stinky, next to a guy who smells like an ashtray&nbsp;and is coughing up nasty stuff.&nbsp; And I am feeling sorry for myself because I have been rejected or I have rejected every job that has come my way.&nbsp; I have about 3 weeks left before I get desperate for a job - but too late, I am already a little bit desperate.&nbsp;  &nbsp; So I sit down at the computer and go to check my email, and I have 24 messages waiting in there - 20 of which (of course) are junk mail, 2 are advertising parties in my ward (two thumbs down) and the last two of which almost made me cry (I love you guys!!).&nbsp; I so badly needed an uplifing today (even though I didn't know it) and there it is, in my email box.&nbsp; It is absolutely amazing to me that&nbsp;HF can take one person who I know only via the telephone line and another person who just randomly found my site somehow and have them say just the things I need to hear.&nbsp; I hope that I am in tune enough to know when He is asking me to do the same (sadly, I think I am sorely lacking in that area). &nbsp; So, I didn't get the job I really wanted (obviously from my previous comment) and I didn't get another job that I thought I would but didn't really want... and I have only one more prospect on the horizon.&nbsp; An interview in central Phoenix this afternoon - part time, great pay.&nbsp; Who knows, maybe its the one I have been looking for.&nbsp;&nbsp; And temp jobs suck. &nbsp; Enough about the job search - I am sure everyone is sick of my whining. &nbsp; I started a home improvement project on Friday night.&nbsp; I started to clean the cupboards and walls above my washer and dryer, which are in my kitchen, and I discovered how absolutely disgusting they were.&nbsp; (Backstory - I live in a huge 45 year old townhouse with original fixtures. I have an original&nbsp;pink porcelain sink in the kitchen and an original powder blue toilet in one of the bathrooms, among other really cool things.&nbsp; It's awesome.)&nbsp; This spawned a massive cupboard cleaning frenzy, which included three trips to the Home Depot for cleaning solvent and paint (the whole project totalling about $20, cha ching!&nbsp; ... ok, and 20 hours of hard labor),&nbsp;removal of all of the cabinet doors, drawers&nbsp;and handles, and an incredibly dishevled house.&nbsp; (Ok, I cleaned and refinished the cupboard fronts and painted the inside of the cupboards.&nbsp; I have plans to re-paint the pulls as well)&nbsp; I am most of the way done... just a couple of drawers left to clean and everything to wipe down... ok, and maybe a little bit more painting, and my kitchen looks&nbsp;INCREDIBLE!!&nbsp; I should have taken before and after pictures... Maybe I still will.&nbsp; I am very excited about how good it looks (obviously, I am a freak with ocd). &nbsp; My friend Josiah thinks that I am sexually frustrated.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Anyway, I can't wait to&nbsp;get done and put everything back.&nbsp; I have plans&nbsp;for the rest of the house, and I am  dying  to vacuum and clean the neglected parts of the house.&nbsp; I think I am going to refinish my front door - it's disgusting. &nbsp; Ok, so if frenzied cleaning&nbsp;is a sign&nbsp;of said frustration, then I am officially diagnosed.&nbsp;  &nbsp; But upon retrospection, what Law-of-Chastity-abiding, current-temple-recommend-holding, unmarried, unattached, no-prospects-even-on-the-distant-horizon, has-more-casual-friends-than-casual-dates, every-time-she-goes-on-a-date-she-asks-him, Mormon over the age of... oh, 24.8 or so  isn't ?&nbsp; (for those of you interested, this scenario is WAY more common than one might think, and certainly way more common than one should expect). &nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Watch out.&nbsp; I am not getting any, I am not going to get some anytime soon, and I might cause some serious damage.&nbsp;  &nbsp; When I clean&nbsp;the remaining flat surfaces of my home.&nbsp;

						   I am so tired.    When I said that I had 6 weeks to find a job and that there was no pressure, I was lying.  At least about the no pressure part.  I am seriously stressed out. I believe that I am developing an ulcer.  I had an interview this morning with a place that wants a temp for 3 months.  They want a $14 employee for $10.50 pay... and they want this person to work from 8am to 5pm.  This is all fine and dandy - some pay is better than no pay, but I really don't want to look for a job again in 3 months - and since they want someone to work during regular business hours, I would have to put it off until the job was over.  I was really hoping that they wouldn't offer me the job, but they did.  I am supposed to start on Thursday, and I am really hoping that I get offered a permanent position before then.  I feel exceedingly guilty about this whole thing, but honestly, I have to consider myself first here.  I do have a second interview with the law firm on Wednesday.  This is good - kindof.  The job seems ok, except that it is about an hours drive from my house... probably more in rush hour.  I just heard from my friend Beth that she checked my references this morning - also good.  I wonder how many other people she has a second interview with?  Anyway, my lease is up in a month and a half or so, and I keep finding roaches (more on that below), so maybe I could just move a little closer.  The main problem with that being that the job is in North Scottsdale - highly exclusive, very expensive.    Basically, I am unhappy with all of my job prospects except one - the marketing company.  I was expecting to hear back from them on Friday afternoon or this morning... nothing yet.  Argh!  I am trying not to get discouraged, but it is really hard.  Honestly, I have had so danged many crappy jobs that I really don't want to settle for anything less than the "perfect" job, but I am deathly afraid that I will end up penniless in the middle of August with no prospects.  Another problem: I have a week long vacation with the family starting the second weekend in August.  I can't miss the vacation since my family has already changed stuff around for me - expensive changes, I am guessing.  Plus, I really need the vacation, its been planned for two years, and I am not missing it (It involves spending a week on a yacht with every need taken care of. yee haw)  I feel a serious depression coming on.  You know, sometimes, things come so easy.  Sometimes some of those things are easy, and others of them are really, really hard.  Why can't it all be easy at the same time?  For example - Lately, I am having no problems with scripture study, prayer, going to church, etc - the "sunday school stuff."  But I am having an issue with something else (that I would rather not name specifically in this, or really any other venue).  This something else affects almost every part of every day.  The guilt is overwhelming, and I honestly feel like I am not in control.  Why is it that I can do everything else right, but I can't stay in control in this one area?    Another aspect of this problem is this:  How can I expect or even ask for help from Heavenly Father in parts of my life that I really need immediate help with (case in point: Job Hunt) when I can't even follow easy instructions in this area (case in point: thou shalt not... aka don't do it)?    I guess there is no real answer to any of this.  We all have our struggles, and this is mine.  The point is to overcome this before it gets seriously out of control, and keep plugging away.    Thanks everyone for all of your support.  I love you guys.   oh, yeah, the roach bit.  Many a year ago, my roomate and I had a nasty nasty sewer flood in our apartment.  (that night lives on in infamy, and Beth - I will never part with that coffee table).  As it turns out, it was a clog in the main sewer line which caused a backup into our apartment.  It was rather yucky, and it took them weeks to really get it cleaned up.  After they were done, Beth and I had the occasional roach in the apartment.  Nothing major, just 3 or 4 total, but we were completely grossed out.  How does this relate to anything?  Beth and I were spoiled only finding 3 or 4 roaches.  When Melanie and I first moved into the house that I still live in (Melanie was married 2 Saturdays ago), we found a few roaches.  They were the giant sewer kind, and I attributed it to the fact that the place hadn't been lived in in quite some time.  We covered the shower drains and lived with it, and the roaches stopped after a few days.  Lately, in the past month and a half or so, the city has been working on the utilities in the street in front of the house.  The roaches started back up again - about one a night coming from a bathroom that I don't use (I have been living alone and there are two full bathrooms in the house).  I cleaned the bathroom really well, made sure all of the drains were covered, and ran the water in the sink every night (the sink drain can't be stopped up - its seriously old school).  Last week, my sister moved in with me and started using that bathroom.  We have continued to find about a roach a night in the house - which she kills and I clean up (yes, we have developed a system).    Why this long, drawn out story?  Thursday night, I got home about 11pm (Art Walk in Scottsdale - great fun! I met an interesting boy... maybe something will come of it?)  My sister was home, and there was a guy that I didn't know sitting on the couch.  It didn't take long for them to explain that Aaron (the unidentified guy) had come over to kill the 8 roaches that were in the bathroom.  EIGHT!!  At one time!  We were all dry heaving by the time the roach massacre was over.  They were HUGE.  They were disgusting.  We are talking the legnth of my index finger roaches.  Never have I seen anything so disgusting in my house.  Yes, it topped the sewer flood incident.    I called the landlord on Friday morning to complain about it.  He told me that he would come by and pour some bleach down the drains - um no.  That's not good enough, besides, I poured drain-o down the drains just the other day, and last I checked drain-o is more caustic than bleach.    Yuck.  Might have to move.

						   For some reason lately, I am completely uninspired as far as blogging goes.  It seems like I have a much more active life now, but really, I interacted with more people when I had a job.  I interviewed for a place this morning - a marketing/advertising agency.  I really want the job.  The owner of the company had a lifesized cardboard cutout of Austin Powers in his office.  The moment I saw that, I knew he would be fun and that the office would be casual.  I really want the job (did I say that already?)  I have been interviewing for places that I have just not been all that enthused about... nothing has really been tickling my fancy.  Call centers (2, so far) a law firm way out in the boondocks, a ton of temp agencies.  This is the first one that I have really been excited about.    I hate the waiting.  I hate not knowing what comes next.  The guy I interviewed with said that he was only interviewing 6 people... so my odds are pretty good.  He also said that he wants me to come back on Tuesday or Wednesday to meet everybody (good sign???  Standard operating procedure??  Am I getting my hopes up for nothing???)  Argh!    So, now, I just keep plugging away.  (Someone told me that McDonald's might be hiring...)

						   So, the job search is on.  I officially started yesterday morning.    So far, 3 staffing agencies have recruited me for an interview, and I have gone to my old trusty staffing agency, who has set me up with an interview today, with a possibility for another later this week.    I did come across a company looking for someone with good grammer.  I decided not to apply.  I don't think I can maintain that level of quality.  Everything is pretty blah lately.  I still don't feel all that good, and I forgot how frustrating it can be to apply to a bajillion jobs and never hear a peep from any of them.  Wouldn't it be nice if they just sent out a mass email to everyone they aren't interested in that says: "hey, you suck.  You don't have an ice cube's chance in h*ll of getting this job.  We found someone prettier, nicer, smarter, and with way more education than you.  Move along now, little peon. P.S. Maybe McDonalds has openings?"   My other problem is that I don't know what I am supposed to do to fill the day up with stuff.  Like today - I have finished my resume, printed it out for this afternoon's stuff, applied for the newest jobs posted on monster, and now what??  I feel like it is a giant waste of time and effort to walk into places that don't have jobs advertised.  I have worked at way too many places that file your efforts in the circular file.  Any suggestions?  How did people find jobs before the internet?  I think what I am going to do today is find a list of photographers and mail my resume with a cover letter to them.  (Dream job: personal assistant to a photographer)  I feel a little guilty just sitting around doing nothing.

						   So, since Tuesday night, I have been feeling like death warmed over.  Fever, chills, various gastro-intestinal issues, inability to eat, you name it.  I have felt terrible.  I went to the urgent care on wednesday... got a shot, then went back home to be miserable in peace.    Yesterday, I get a call from the boss.  He has bad news and wants to come over to my house.  I could not sit and stew about it, so I made him tell me what was up.  The department lacks the funding to keep paying me, so I no longer have a job.  Boss vigouously assured me that this decision had absolutely nothing to do with my performance, in fact, quite the contrary... and they are going to keep paying me for the next 6 weeks.    Yuck.    This does however, give me the opportunity to find something in say... photography????  I am a little excited about maybe finding a job where I can actually do something fun all day, rather than sitting around doing nothing.  And, since I have 6 weeks to find something, there is little to no stress about it.

						   I am a negative person lately.  I think this is probably due to the fact that I have been looking for a job for a month now, and stuff just keeps going wrong.  Who knows - maybe its a test.  Can she keep a good attitude when she is living out of her car in a month?  How bout when she has to live in a cardboard box behind the Walmart?  (ok, I am not really that bitter, or that hard up for money... but donations are always accepted.  Let me know if you are interested.)  So, I had a second interview for a job on Tuesday, and I left just absolutely certain that I got the job.  The girl I interviewed with sat down with the boss, and in my prescence said "I feel very strongly that Lyndsay is the right candidate for this position."  Yay.  Wednesday morning, I get a call from the agency that sent me out for this interview, saying that I didn't get the job.  What???!!!  Apparently, they ran a credit report and it came back with something on it that is negative.  WHAT???!!!!   So, I literally ran to the library, ordered myself a report, and took a look myself.  Yep, there is a thing or two on there that I didn't do.  But here is the funny part: the negative stuff on there totals about $50.  I didn't get a job because there is $50 in collections???  How is that?  So, its probably going to take me two or three months to get this stuff cleared off my record - which sucks royally.   And let me tell you this: it is next to impossible to get anything out of these collection agencies.  They do not want to part with any information whatsoever - but they are more than happy to take information from me.  If they think that I am just going to pay them blindly, they are on crack.  Not going to happen.  One company told me that since the problem is so old (1998), I would have to prove to them that I didn't have them as a service.  Are you freaking kidding me?  No, You have to prove to ME that I DID.  Seems to me that if you think someone owes you money that you would keep some records on what that person did to incur the charges.  Just a thought MCI.   Here's another thought: is it any wonder that MCI declared bankruptcy?  Crooks.  Trying to get money from a person that has NEVER (and WILL never) use their services.   Fun stuff.  Needless to say, I am more than a little peeved about the whole thing.  But I did just get a call about another interview tomorrow.  Yay!  I think I accidentally hung up on her though - sketchy cell phone service is to blame.   Anyhow, I leave for Washington on Saturday evening - right after my first Mesa LTD class.  I am excited.  Its going to be fun - and I am not going to think about anything while I am gone.   The lady next to me has a bottle of perfume on, so I am outie.  Have a great week guys (don't think I will write again until I get back).

						   Sorry about the long delay folks.  Everything is fine, I have not seen hide nor hair of the breaker-inner, so I think he is probably history now that he doesn't have an easy way into the house.  I must state for the record that I have lived on my own for upwards of 7 years now and I have never had a problem such as this, and I don't expect to again.  My windows are staying locked from now on.  I was offered a job on Friday, which I decided to take, but today is Tuesday and the job was absolutely terrible, so I bailed.  It paid really well, but not well enough.  I am hoping that I didn't just hang myself as I will have no money coming in after the family vacation next week.  I am praying that something good will happen this week.  I have three interviews scheduled so far this week, and it wouldn't be a problem if it picked up a little bit.  One of the interviews is apparently really excited to meet with me - I am hoping that I like her and that the job is something that I am interested in.  Again - lots of praying here.    Last night for FHE, my ward combined with another singles ward here in the valley for a very nice sit down dinner and then a speaker.  It was one of the best FHE's I have been to in a very long time.  The food was great, the speaker was great, the company enjoyable.  Ok, I am still experiencing a lack of wittiness.  I think its the fact that I spend a lot of time with myself.  Frightening, really.  More in upcoming days.
