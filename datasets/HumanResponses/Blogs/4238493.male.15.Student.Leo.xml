      Movie title: Twins Effect 2, The Battle Of Huadu  Length: App. 2 hours  You'd recognise: Charlene, Gillian, Jaycee, Tony Leung  Summary: The land of Huadu is where all man are slaves and where all woman are in control. This is so thanks to the evil queen (talk about originality!) who reigns over the land. Man are often sold as slaves and are termed "Dumb Bells". Yet there is a prophecy who foretells a man, The Star Of Rex, who will take the holy sword Excalibur and vanquish the Evil queen. (Yawn)  Review: Take the effects of The Matrix, the backdrop of The Lord Of The Rings and finally the storyline from any fairy tale that has an evil queen and voila! You get Twins Effect 2. Despite it's almost lack of originality, it is a great movie! Slow-down effects (called Bullet time in Matrix) are placed well and weapons blend in along with the storyline, but still the effects need to look more natural. Having The Twins to act in this movie might be the only attractor for this movie. I personally think that the character of The Star Of Rex does not suit the style of Jaycee Chan's acting. The storyline seems interesting, everything is there  but in the end it isn't the sword that saved the day but LOVE. No offence against that but... They didn't mention LOVE in the prophecy! Charlene fufills her role very well as the naive, stubborn and childish natured, 13th Young Master. Also, Gillian does a above average job as the stern but trying not to be stern, Blue Bird. Guest stars vary from Edison Chen to Jackie Chan. I personally feel that Jackie Chan shouldn't be roled into the movie. The ending is horrible. Queen dies, Star of rex runs off to have fun leaving the kingdom to Charlene and husband who later gave birth to twins... Thinking that this movie is all serious? NO! There is a comdey side to it some parts are quite funny but they could be improved on.  Effects: 7/10 Good effects and not to mention cool but needs to be made to look natural.  Storyline:8/10 Strong storyline but lack developments in few areas.  Sound:6/10 Nice music that blends into the surrondings but when things get HOT the music is forgotten.  Overall:6/10 Twins' fans, watch this. While the rest watch it only if you want to spend your weekend time.

      Many a times people may ask... what is life? why does it suck so much? why are there bloody suckers who act as gangsters? to me life...is a challenge set by our god...from what i learnt from obs...it's about how u feel in different situations so if you choose to feel shitty about the world then it's shitty... Tough Times Don't Last, But Tough Minds Do- Louis OBS Instructor...those so-called gangsters...they are mostly jus being immatured...i believe that they are sent by god as an obstacle to test our faith...and further on later in their lives, they will b cleanse...that's what i truly think... Whoever gives heed to instruction prospers; and blessed is he who trusts in the LORD- Proverbs 16 Verse 20...then some may go on and ask... what is love? it is simply...A word...like mentioned in the matrix...it's a word that serves no meaning. the true meaning of it lies in each indivdual's heart...true it is that there is no necessary to love...but all humans need love to go on, to give themselves a little push when they need it....i shan't elaborate but i hope i find my true one soon...-OySt3r

      ThIs is da 1st post on da new blog...ehehe...its 2004!!!!!!!!!! LET THE PARTY ROCk! i would like to start off by saying... some things in life are never fair... A gentle answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger-Proverbs:15 Verse:1 Remember...don't be too tough or gentle for someone...leave enough space for him or her to experience consequential learning...being too soft will cause him/her to be too dependant. being too tough will cause him/her to think that you are neglecting their feelings...balance it well... Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam; so drop the matter before a dispute breaks out-Proverbs 17 Verse 14...i hope everyone understands all this and make the world a better place...-OySt3r
