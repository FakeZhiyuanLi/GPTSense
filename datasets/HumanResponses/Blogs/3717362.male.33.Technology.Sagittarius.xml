      Yep, went down to the Ice Palace (yeah, that's deliberate) last night for the DVD preview party. I took my 4 year old, Ethan, who had a lot of fun. The line to get a picture with the Stanley Cup was about 45 minutes long, but Ethan did great. The good news / bad news was that to keep the line moving, you were pretty rushed when your shot came. Regardless, it was pretty cool having my son there, and him showing some enthusiam for this truly impressive trophy.   Of course, he was really hyped about the games that were setup there for the kids. One had kids playing goalie with the full complement of pads, mask, glove, blocker, and stick. They had a machine shooting ten or so pucks at each kid. Ethan loved it -- he even caught a puck with his glove. They also had a deal where the kids could shoot balls at a big goalie poster. Anyway, if I can figure out how to post pics here, I'll do that.   Oh yeah -- T-minus two weeks and counting ... and counting ... and counting ...

      Nice move to pull  urlLink this  off two days early.  It undoubtedly caught the terrorists, who would have loved nothing more than to wreak havoc at the transfer ceremony, completely flat-footed.  This deserves a tip-o-the-hat to the folks involved.  I expect most everyone is pulling for this new government to succeed.

      You never know what seemingly insignificant actions may head off a complete tragedy.    A mentally unbalanced man in Toronto (where I happened to be just last week) was armed to the teeth and intent on a killing spree.  However, he encountered a friendly dog in a park, and it softened his heart.  As a result, he abandoned his plan and turned him self into the police.  You just never know.   urlLink Oddly Enough News Article | Reuters.com : "Friendly Dog Prevents Killing Spree?"

      I am heartbroken and outraged over the unspeakable brutality of the Iraqi militants who have beheaded now three hostages.  This isn't a swift act.  This is taking a victim who is begging for their life, and sawing their head off with a knife.  Inhumane, mercilous, sickening, dispicable.  My heart goes out to the families of these victims, as I cannot fathom the imact on them.  Just attempting to imagine it is overwhelming.  I pray that they find peace through the Comforter, the Holy Spirit.  Only God can judge a man's heart.  But actions in this life earn consequences in this life.  May those consequences be swift.

      Interesting rumors about Microsoft being interested in buying Network Associates, presumably for their McAfee anti-virus software.  MS has made it clear that they intend to provide anti-virus capabilities themselves, undoubtedly to the chagrin of their long time anti-virus partners.    MS certainly is more than capable financially of buying out NA, but it would seem a little out of character. More often than not, they may buy a small technology company, but do a significant amount of their own development on top of that.  In this case, they'd be buying a fairly mature solution, lock, stock and barrel.  Worth watching ...

      RFID, or Radio Frequency Identification, continues to trip privacy alarms in my head.  These little tags will be embedded in all sorts of things you buy.  They will legitimately do a better job of what barcodes do, as well as reduce theft.  But the added observation power they give to anyone with a RFID Reader is concerning at best.  "You" can be tracked by RFID-tagged clothes or other consumer items you carry around.  Where you go, what you do, what you buy, what you pick up but decide not to buy, ...    Not trivial stuff.  And it is coming.  One of the biggest drivers: Walmart.

      More Stanley Cup revelry!!  As with the Bucs' Superbowl victory, there will be a DVD of the Lightning's Championship season, including the entirety of Game 7 of the Finals.  The Lightning will be holding a viewing party down at the Ice Palace the night before the DVD goes on sale.  Lord Stanley's hardware will be in attendance, too.  Might have to go check that out!  Speaking of the Cup, I keep hearing about random appearances at various local bars.  In one instance, a friend from work was there.  Not being a barfly myself, I'm bummin'!  Any REAL friend of mine better call me if the Cup shows up wherever there at!!

      Reading lots about mobile high speed data capabilities planned for late 2005 timeframe.  Sprint and Verizon are expecting performance near cable modem or DSL levels (using EV-DO).  Cingular is going after a different technology (using HSDPA).  Not hearing anything from T-Mobile.  (Grumble, Grumble.)  Sure do like the Number Portability feature!

      Sometimes, the Hurricane football program takes all the sport out of making fun of them.  Nevertheless, we the faithful will follow through on our obligations.  Willie Williams pled "no contest" to charges stemming from a recruiting trip to UF.  The result is one year's probation.  Except, he was already on probation (and has to see a judge about how this matter might have violated that)!  This is the guy that has a police record of some 10 arrests!  And the 'Canes are apparently fine with this.  Just shows you that most of the time we work hard to earn the reputations we get!

      As promised ...    Tuesday, July 13   That's consecutive nights on minimal sleep, now, getting everything together.&nbsp; Even so, getting up at 6am seems somehow easier when you can say "I think we should go to Hawaii today" when the alarm clock goes off.  First stop: Atlanta.&nbsp; First fight: Atlanta.&nbsp; Enough of that -- Stevie needs to relax.  Second stop: Los Angeles.&nbsp; Arriving early is great.&nbsp; But arriving 30 minutes early when you already had a 2.5 hour layover is a bit of a drag.&nbsp; Let's GO already!!  Wahooo!!&nbsp; We're here!&nbsp; Got the Jeep.&nbsp; Now for supplies.&nbsp; Which predictably takes far longer that it should.&nbsp; Sometime shortly after 9pm (Hawaiian time), we head for the rental house in Kipahulu.  This drive goes through the center of the island, along the west side of Haleakala, and then east along the south edge of the island.&nbsp; And the last 15 miles of the drive is on a really bad facsimile of a road.&nbsp; Part of it is asphalt with more patches than original road, and part of it is somewhat graded dirt.&nbsp; But, hey, that's what the Jeep is for, right?&nbsp; Christy called this our Rhino Rally drive.&nbsp; Oh, and to quote Helen Hunt from 'Twister', "Cow."&nbsp; The "Cow Xing" signs are not hypothetical.&nbsp; We're going from one blind hill to the next blind turn to ... cows.&nbsp; In and beside the road.&nbsp; Dozens of them.  Sometime before 11pm (again, Hawaiian), we arrive at Anya's House.&nbsp; This place is just spectacular.&nbsp; Go to www.anyashouse.com to see it.&nbsp; The half mile drive from the main road to the house is yet another good reason for the 4x4.&nbsp; Being this far from civilization, and presently without the moon, the stars shine like I have never seen them.&nbsp; The Milky Way galaxy is just as plain as it could be.&nbsp; Simply amazing.  It was a ridiculously long journey to get here, but we're here.&nbsp; After being up for 25 consecutive ours, we finally turn in at 1am.&nbsp; Hawaiian Time.&nbsp; Whew.    Wednesday, July 14   That internal clock hasn't adjusted yet.&nbsp; We're both awake at about 6am.&nbsp; Maybe it's just the adrenaline.&nbsp; Going back to sleep doesn't seem to be an option now, even for me, so we get ourselves going.  We arrive at the Ohe'o Gulch, aka the Seven Sacred Pools (which is only a mile down the road -- and not sacred in any respect), before the rangers do, and start hiking up above the pools toward the Waimoku Falls.&nbsp; A 2 mile (each way) hike perhaps isn't the smartest way to start a trip like this, but that's what we're doin'.&nbsp; Actually, I didn't realize the hike was this long until we were a few minutes into it, and happened to look at the guidebook ("Maui Revealed" -- excellent book!) for our first landmark.&nbsp; Christy wasn't too thrilled, particularly since I didn't bring the water, but she was willing to stick with it (but it required me hotfooting it back to get the water pack).  We saw the Makahiku falls from an outlook on the trail, and suspected that (what the guidebook calls) the Infinity Pool was at the top of those falls.  Yep, suspicions turned out true.&nbsp; What a cool place.&nbsp; This pool has an effect like the "infinity pools" that seem to have no edge on one side.&nbsp; The water was a little too cold for swimming just yet.&nbsp; So, we hiked out onto the rocks overlooking the gorge for a breathtaking view.  Back on the trail again, we found another set of falls and a pool.&nbsp; Apparently, you can hike up from the Infinity Pool to the falls that come out of this pool.&nbsp; Might have to try that on another trip.&nbsp; This pool has carved a big cave in the far wall of the mountain.&nbsp; The falls feeding this pool are pretty loud, given their height.  Found another set of multiple falls and small pools, which I promptly set out to climbing lots of the rock formations.  Onward and upward.&nbsp; We came to a pair of bridges that cross over some great falls and a pretty sizeable pool.&nbsp; As we walk up, a couple guys are setting up to jump from the bridge.&nbsp; Mind you, the bridge is a good 40 feet above this pool.&nbsp; Apparently the guys had been here the day before doing the same thing.&nbsp; After talking to them, they live in Utah (working at The Canyons ski resort), and along with a few friends, they sailed here from San Francisco.&nbsp; They put on quite a show.&nbsp; Not enough for audience participation, but quite a show.&nbsp; (I must admit, I was a little tempted.&nbsp; But just a little.)  Next, we entered a bamboo forest.&nbsp; Now this was impressive.&nbsp; It makes great noises when the wind blows.  And for the payoff: arriving at the foot of the 400 foot Waimoku Falls.&nbsp; This might have ruined all the other falls we haven't gotten to yet on the famed Road to Hana.&nbsp; Now, immediately, you might want to get right in under the falls.&nbsp; Until you start considering what else besides water might be falling on your head from 400 feet above.&nbsp; But still, you've come all this way, gotta do it, real quick like.&nbsp; So I get in and while I'm waiting for Christy to take the picture, my heart is pumping and it feels like the water level is suddenly surging, sweeping Lord knows what on down with it.&nbsp; Christy gets the shot and I get back in my right mind.&nbsp; No sense in exercising those life insurance policies right away.  Now for the downside.&nbsp; Literally.&nbsp; For 2 more miles.  When we get down, we just veg in the car for a bit -- sitting down is a blessed change.&nbsp; Then we head on down to the 7 pools.&nbsp; Which is a bit reminiscent of the Dunn's River Falls in Jamaica, given the throngs of people.&nbsp; The water is naturally too cold for Christy.&nbsp; But I go hiking around to get to one of the higher pools, from which a few guys have jumped into a lower pool.&nbsp; This one I can't resist.&nbsp; It does take a sadly long period of introspection before I can finally make the leap.&nbsp; But it was worth it.  Being all out of water, and only a mile or so from our rental house, we went back to fill up.&nbsp; Which turned into more of a rest stop than originally billed.&nbsp; Anyway, we headed off again toward Hana.  We stopped at Hamoa Beach, which looked nice, but being this late in the day, it was completely engulfed in shade.&nbsp; Christy wanted to look for shopping places in Hana.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; What (microscopically) little there was turned out to be closed already.&nbsp; (Yes, I successfully fought back the tears.)  So instead, we drove down to Hana Bay to look around.&nbsp; Hana Bay isn't that exciting but there is a little (and I really mean little) red sand beach that you can get to by a trail at the south end of the bay.&nbsp; Christy was done with hiking, so she waited while I checked it out.&nbsp; The trail was short but required climbing and the footing was real loose.&nbsp; But what a great little spot.&nbsp; The red sand was really rich red.&nbsp; I dug it, and I thought Christy would too, but she would hear none of it.&nbsp;  We drove around to where the big red sand beach was supposed to be accessible.&nbsp; Again, Christy waited while I explored.&nbsp; Another really impressive location.&nbsp; The water was particularly turquoise in color, which put up against the red sand and the red cliff walls just looked stunning.&nbsp; We'll have to come back to this one tomorrow when Christy has more energy.    Thursday, July 15   Slept later and took longer to get going.&nbsp; Didn't leave until after 9am.&nbsp; I gotta' keep remembering that this is vacation!  We started out at what the guidebook calls the Venus pool.&nbsp; Fantastic spot!&nbsp; It's part tide pool and part spring fed, which makes for constant temperature change as you swim around in it.&nbsp; And yes, Christy even got in.&nbsp; I continued yesterday's cliff jumping theme here.&nbsp; With the waves crashing at the barrier between the pool and the ocean, and the lava formations all around, this easily holds up as a top spot.&nbsp;  Next stop is the big red sand beach.&nbsp; It's only a five minute hike, but it is pretty steep up and down stuff, so Christy's not so thrilled.&nbsp; The swimming area has a little protection from the waves due to some big lava formations creating a demarcation line.&nbsp; But still the swells tend to push you around quite a bit in here.&nbsp; After hanging out a while longer on the beach itself, we hiked back out.&nbsp; This hiking stuff is falling further and further out of favor, I'm afraid.  Out of this dinky little town.&nbsp; It's off to the Waianapanapa State Park, with it's Black Sand Beach and freshwater caves.&nbsp; The Black Sand Beach is quite a sight, and there's cave you can crawl into that opens to the water.&nbsp; Great little side bonus.&nbsp; Heading down into the freshwater caves, a park employee is walking a couple down ahead of us, so we follow closely.&nbsp; She tells them where it's safe to jump in, and where the caves lead back, and a room that you can get to underwater.&nbsp; I did the jump and I explored back in caves a little, but without mask and fins (which were back in the Jeep) I wasn't up for trying to reach the room underwater.  Next stop is the Blue Pool.&nbsp; Now the book describes the unpaved road leading to this spot as being kinda' rough.&nbsp; But we come across this sign, apparently erected by native Hawaiians, that is decidedly dissuasive concerning proceeding to the Blue Pool. &nbsp;Do I listen?&nbsp; You know better than that.&nbsp; The road did turn out to be an adventure, but the Jeep had no trouble.&nbsp; I'm not quite sure how some of the other cars I saw coming and going did.&nbsp; It turns out to be a pretty unique place, with a nice waterfall and a small pool, all right at the edge of the ocean.&nbsp; Hope the pictures I took with the water camera turn out.  On to Nahiku, which turned out to be a bit anti-climactic.&nbsp; The guidebook described it as being the place where all green things went to heaven.&nbsp; Neither of us could find such grandeur to it.&nbsp; It had a tiny little waterfall at the end with a cute pool, which would have been fun to hang out in, but time is getting away from us.  If we're to complete the drive at a decent time, we can't be stopping at every site for more exploration.&nbsp; Just have to experience it from the highway.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; Especially at Waikani Falls (aka, the 3 Bears Falls).&nbsp; Some kids found a way to hike down from the bridge to the falls.&nbsp; With more time, I'd have definitely been down there.&nbsp; Anyway, the remainder of the drive had some stunning views, including a sleepy little town, way down below the highway that you just wanted to go pinch its little cheeks.  The Road to Hana (or, in our case, the Road from Hana) has been conquered.&nbsp; We decide to take Makawao Road back to Highway 37, to get back to the rental house.&nbsp; This takes us to the nice little town of Makawao.&nbsp; It's a shame we didn't find this place during business hours.&nbsp; A shame, indeed.  Back on that sort of road.&nbsp; With the cows. &nbsp;Just reminds you, even in a car, just how long 15 miles is.    Friday, July 16   Parting is such sweet sorrow.&nbsp; It's time to bid adieu to Anya's Awesome House.&nbsp; We're gonna miss this place.  The good news is that we finally get to see the bumpety-bump drive through central Maui in the daylight.&nbsp; Seeing the conditions of the road was altogether amusing.&nbsp; The whole area, however, turns out to be quite impressive.&nbsp; It's simultaneously both desolate and beautiful.&nbsp; The trade winds blow primarily from the northeast.&nbsp; All the moisture in those winds gets dropped on the northeast side of the island, hence the near rainforest-like greenery of the road to Hana.&nbsp; The moisture can't make it past Haleakala, so the southwest side of the volcano is completely arid.&nbsp; But there are impressive vistas in this area, with lava formations, some making deep gorges and some leading out into the crashing waves.&nbsp; The colors are striking.&nbsp; There are a couple places along the drive where you can drive down to the water and have all the beach you could see to yourself.  Oh, and as badly as you want the guidebook to be wrong about a public road connecting this highway and Makena/Kihei, it's right.&nbsp; Can't get there from here.&nbsp; What a pain.  We drove north all the way up to Kahului, and then south past Maalaea to get to Lahaina, to do some shopping.&nbsp; Christy finally sees some boats, something she didn't see any of in east Maui.&nbsp; Lahaina is a cool town.&nbsp; Quaint shops, funky restaurants, the island of Lanai off the coast, boats everywhere.&nbsp; We'll have to spend more time here on another visit.&nbsp; Alas, we only had 2-3 hours before having to high-tail it back to the airport to fly to Kauai.  Once on Kauai, we're doing the whole grocery stock up exercise again.&nbsp; Which means we don't get to the rental cottage until late.&nbsp; Again.&nbsp; Mix in a little confusion on the directions on how to find the cottage itself on the owner's property, and you have yourself quite a scene.&nbsp; No biggie, though.  The cottage isn't as impressive as Anya's house, but it isn't nearly as remote either.&nbsp; And the impression that I had that a beach was accessible by simply walking down the road didn't seem to be accurate either.&nbsp; Of course, we never stopped to ask about it, so maybe that was our own fault.    Saturday, July 17   Our intention has been to take a helicopter ride and an ocean tour while on Kauai.&nbsp; But we haven't booked anything yet.&nbsp; So the first order of business is to get recommendations from "The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook: Kauai Revealed" (written by the same folks as "Maui Revealed", as you might have guessed).&nbsp; We settle on Air Kauai for this afternoon and North Shore Charters (via a referral) for Monday morning.&nbsp; So with the critical arrangements squared away, we head out for the Waimea Canyon.  Mark Twain was right.&nbsp; The Grand Canyon of the Pacific.&nbsp; Such rich red and green color.&nbsp; And there's one waterfall way off in the distance that doesn't reach the bottom.&nbsp; About half way down, the wind blows the falling stream of water into a mist.&nbsp; Really cool.&nbsp; At the top of the drive is one of the most impressive lookouts you may ever find, peering down a valley and out to the ocean.  Off to Lihue for our helicopter ride.&nbsp; This one holds six passengers, four in the back and two up front with the pilot (who is on the left).&nbsp; The right side of the plane is prime because all the charters tour the island in a clockwise direction.&nbsp; The pilot decides, once everyone is there, who sits where, based on height and weight.&nbsp; Turns out, we get the front, with me on the right -- the best seat in the house.&nbsp; The guidebook tells you the right side is better, but the tour companies try to tell you it doesn't matter that much, but make no mistake, it matters!&nbsp; I felt bad for the lady who was stuck in the back on the right, who later complained about her comparative lack of view from back there.&nbsp; And the guy in the right middle back seat is constantly reaching his camera over his wife (in the outside right back seat) and almost aimlessly snapping photos.&nbsp; But in the front, it was stellar!&nbsp; This pilot has a great routine down, playing Jurassic Park themes, and coming up against cliffs revealing eye-popping scenes timed perfectly to the crescendos.&nbsp; And the whole ride is about as smooth as it can be.&nbsp; The Na Pali coast just has to be seen to be believed.&nbsp; Pictures are wholly inadequate, but obligatory.&nbsp; When we land, we all have the same sloppy grins as the bunch that preceded us.  After this sensory overload, we check out the Wailua Falls.&nbsp; Very nice.&nbsp; Should have hiked down to the bottom, but didn't in the interests of sparing Christy's energy and patience.&nbsp; Maybe next time.  We stop at the cottage to grab some dinner, and then it's off to the Princeville Hotel.&nbsp; Unfortunately, we took too long at the cottage, so we missed sunset.&nbsp; Word is that clouds have been obscuring the sunsets all week.&nbsp; But, wow, what a hotel.&nbsp; The lobby is truly opulent.&nbsp; After walking around the place for a bit, we come across a chocolate buffet, which we were incapable of passing up.&nbsp; $12 for a small plate, one pass, back as much on it as you like.&nbsp; And did we ever.&nbsp; all while listening to a fantastic jazz trio.&nbsp; (I am completely intrigued by standup bass.)    Sunday, July 18   Nothing scheduled for today, so we head out on a beach tour.&nbsp; Originally, I wanted to hike a couple miles on the Kalalau Trail, but I didn't think Christy would have the energy for it.&nbsp; Another time.  We start with Larsen's Beach, not far from our cottage. &nbsp;It requires a short hike with a 160 foot vertical drop, and then trekking along the beach for a better location.&nbsp; The intent was to do some snorkeling, but it ends up a bit too shallow to see much.&nbsp; But we have all kinds of room to ourselves.&nbsp; Heading back, Christy doesn't notice Chief Spread Eagle on the back of the beach near the trees.&nbsp; Just as well.&nbsp; He's been out there a lot, apparently.&nbsp; There were a couple other likely barebacks out there, but they were a little more discreet.  Next stop is Secret Beach.&nbsp; Another hike, dropping a good 150 feet, only steeper.&nbsp; Christy is not enthused.&nbsp; Unfortunate, because the beach is really amazing.&nbsp; The Kilauea Lighthouse is on top of the eastern point, with another big rock just off shore from it.&nbsp; The waves crash on some nifty lava formations.&nbsp; And there's a couple small waterfalls trickling down the cliff wall at the back of the beach.&nbsp; A great way to rinse the salt water off.&nbsp; In one of the vertical flows, someone wedged the stalk of a palm branch horizontally, creating a natural spigot.&nbsp; I try to do some snorkeling, but the seas are too rough here today.&nbsp; On the other end of the beach, there are some interesting lava pools to hike around.&nbsp; There may have been a few more two legged deer (while tailed bucks and white tailed does), but they kept off in the distance a good ways.  By now, Christy is wiped out.&nbsp; I skipped the other planned beaches and went on to a place called the Queens Bath, in the Princeville area.&nbsp; Another short hike, but Christy isn't interested, so she sleeps in the car.&nbsp; Hiking down, there's a nice waterfall, which will be useful for rinsing off on the way back up.&nbsp; This stream leads out to the ocean, where it plunges over a lava formation right into the crashing waves.&nbsp; Very impressive.&nbsp; The Queens Bath is a sort of tide pool among the lava rock.&nbsp; Just a great place to hang out.  After a little shopping around Princeville and Hanalei Bay (great little town!), we head back to the Princeville Hotel for another shot at a sunset over Hanalei Bay.&nbsp; Cloudy again!&nbsp; But there is a 2-3 minute window where the sun sneaks out from behind the clouds near the horizon line.&nbsp; Then shrouded again.&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; We take consolation by availing ourselves to their hot tubs.&nbsp; Soooo relaxing.&nbsp; Especially when you're not paying their nutty room rates.    Monday, July 19   Early start!&nbsp; Had to call the captain at 6am to confirm that conditions are ok.&nbsp; Had to meet at Anini Beach at 7am.&nbsp; BTW, Christy feels cheated to only now find a beach that you can actually drive right up to.&nbsp; And it's the safest swimming beach on the North Shore, due to the reef protection.  This is a 30 foot converted fishing boat, and the captain, Gary, only takes 6 people out at a time.&nbsp; Compare this to the consistent 15, 20 or more people on every other charter.&nbsp; In fact, Gary refers to the others as "Cattle-marands".&nbsp; The other four people on our tour includes a Dad, his 21 year old son (whose birthday is today), his 18 year old son, and his 15 year old daughter.&nbsp; They are great fun to share the trip with.  Seeing the Na Pali coast from the air for part of an hour long helicopter ride is fantastic.&nbsp; Seeing it from sea level for four hours is equally fantastic.&nbsp; Gotta do them both.&nbsp; The cliffs are overwhelming.&nbsp; One of them towers 1800 feet high.&nbsp; Gary points out several parts of the Kalalau Trail -- just have to come back with family so the guys can do that whole 2-day hike.&nbsp; Once again, the cliffs, the waterfalls, the colors, the layers in the rock, it all amounts to the one of the most impressive places I've ever been.  We stop for snorkeling and lunch.&nbsp; This reef we stop at has several large sea turtles, which totally captivates Christy.  After the ocean tour, we explore the remainder of the drive from Hanalei Bay to the end of the road at Ke'e Beach, which is definitely worth the trouble.&nbsp; Several nice beaches for future reference, a couple cool caves (one with water and one without), and another freshwater stream to cool off in (which I do).  OK, gotta get back to the cottage, clean up, pack up, and head to Oahu for -- gasp -- work!&nbsp; This is, after all, the original purpose for the trip: WS-I is having their 2004 Summer Community Meeting at the Turtle Bay Resort on Oahu's North Shore.&nbsp; If you have to spend time on Oahu (the least interesting of the main Hawaiian Islands), the North Shore is the place to do it.    Tuesday, July 20   It's our 13th wedding anniversary!&nbsp; Not a bad place to spend it, even if I have to work.&nbsp; The room has a fantastic view of the bay.&nbsp; In fact, there is substantial water on three sides of the hotel, so nearly all the views are impressive (more so on the higher floors, which we had).&nbsp; Some hotels bill rooms as having "ocean view", but you have to lean out on the balcony to see it.&nbsp; In this room, you have work hard NOT to see it.  We have dinner at Haleiwa Joe's.&nbsp; Didn't get there in time for sunset during dinner, but we caught it on the way there.&nbsp; While we're waiting for a table, we met a local couple, and the husband (big dude) turns out to be a huge college football fan.&nbsp; I mention being at FSU's first national championship game, and he pauses, then rattles off the names of Warrick Dunn and Charlie Ward.&nbsp; I'm clearly impressed!    Wednesday, July 21   Christy goes out for a horseback excursion.&nbsp; Seems pretty happy about it.&nbsp; After my meetings conclude, we head exactly 9 miles west from the entrance of the resort to a beach that locals say has lots of sea turtles.&nbsp; With snorkel gear in hand, we're set.&nbsp; Only, it turns out that we hardly even need to get our feet wet.&nbsp; Half a dozen or so big turtles are in shin-deep water eating green stuff off the rocks in the water.&nbsp; One (the only male we saw) is asleep on the beach (figures).&nbsp; Christy loooves the turtles.    Thursday, July 22   A luau has been planned at the resort by the WS-I folks.&nbsp; Pretty entertaining.&nbsp; The kid twirling fire was probably the most impressive.&nbsp; He was serious.&nbsp; Later, a few guys including myself get dragged up front for public humiliation.&nbsp; (I might as well be up front about it, and undercut the value of blackmail pictures.)    Friday, July 23   The last day in paradise!&nbsp; Fortunately, work has wrapped up.&nbsp; So I'm taking a surf lesson.&nbsp; Now, Christy tentatively signed up as well.&nbsp; But she has heard that beaches east of the North Shore get a lot of jelly fish, due to the winds.&nbsp; Since the bay by the resort hasn't had waves to speak of, we suspect they'll be taking us elsewhere.&nbsp; When Christy calls in the morning, sure enough, they're taking us about 5 miles around to the east.&nbsp; Christy says, "But aren't there jelly fish?"&nbsp; The girl replies, "Not real jelly fish.&nbsp; Just Man-o-War.&nbsp; You might get rash."&nbsp; Christy promptly cancels her participation.  While I'm filling out all the requisite release forms, I hear one surf dude tell the other one "we better bring the vinegar."&nbsp; Not a good sign!!&nbsp; When we get there and walk along the beach, one surf dude ("instructor" just doesn't seem to fit) points out dozens of the little buggas washed up on the sand.&nbsp; Then he dons a long sleeve rash guard, while the rest of us have been given short sleeve versions.&nbsp; All bad signs!!  The good news is that we never encountered any jelly anythings.&nbsp; The bad news is that Stevie was unprepared for the unique physical demands of paddling required by the sport of surfing.&nbsp; After only two failed attempts, I did figure out how to get up, so I can legitimately say I surfed.&nbsp; But at one point, after an extended battle with the breakers, I surrender and drift in to the sand.&nbsp; After resting a while, I did actually take one more shot, got out there, and got up, so it was worth the effort.&nbsp; Christy caught the last ride on camera, so I have physical evidence!  After cleaning up and getting out of the hotel room, we do some more shopping, slowly making our way down to Honolulu for our flight home.&nbsp; Ah, but there's a catch.&nbsp; Delta called on Tuesday to see if we could change our flight to help them out of an overbooking jam.&nbsp; They offered a flight that gets us home about three hours later than planned -- upgraded to first class!&nbsp; Great, but I need to make sure this is cool with David, who has our young'uns.&nbsp; The hitch is that I can't call the Delta rep back directly.&nbsp; She says she can call me back in five minutes.&nbsp; I clear it with David.&nbsp; I tell Christy, who is elated.&nbsp; And I wait for the call back.&nbsp; And I wait.&nbsp; And wait.&nbsp; This is bad.&nbsp; Opportunity blown.&nbsp; But after some persistence, I find a sympathetic agent who puts us on that flight, in first class, just because of the inconvenience we incurred (and, oh, how we incurred some)!  We call the kids again as we make our way south, but now they're at the end of their tolerance for all of this.&nbsp; Ethan is crying and Jared wants nothing to do with the phone.&nbsp; Sorry, David!  Bottom line is, when it's time to leave paradise behind and face real life again, first class makes it a little easier!    Saturday, July 24   "Mommy! Daddy!"&nbsp; Smiles, hugs and kisses all the way around!   So endeth the hands-down best vacation we've taken.&nbsp; We simply have to go back.&nbsp; Beyond that, I'm left pondering just what exactly it is I would have to do for us to live on Kauai or Maui ....   &nbsp;

      The blob has been dark for a bit while I was in the union's 50th state, but I'm back now. Oh my, what a trip!! I'll be getting a journal of sorts posted here shortly.&nbsp; (Bonus points if you can name the title reference -- without using Google!&nbsp; Certain reunion folk are not eligible.)   However, I was inspired to put up a post by an article about Clemson University installing hydrolic goal posts in an effort to improve safety in postgame celebrations. It's both funny and unfortunate. Funny, in the sense that imagining these posts slowly keeling over after a game (automatically? or in response to fan attack?) just makes me chuckle. Oh, and consider the possibility of a malfunction during a game -- or more specifically, during a kick!! Now there's some potential for real howling! Unfortunate, in the sense that bringing down the goalposts is part of college football. Yeah, I know that it is basically vandalism, and that people do occasionally get hurt. In fact, a police officer broke his collar bone and some ribs during such a free-for-all after the 2002 Clemson-USC game. But anyone who ventures out on the field -- and certainly anywhere near celebrant-covered uprights -- should be assuming any risks surrounding the inevitable fall of said goalposts. I've been part of such revelry, and it is an atmospherethat defies description. It's a shame to see it fading into extinction.   One last thing: UM coach Larry Coker is defending the pending completion to the recruitment of 19 year old, 11 time arrestee, Willie Williams -- with a straight face, no less! He says he's comfortable with what Williams can bring to the program, both on and off the field. On the field, sure, he's a heavy hitter who was the number one linebacker prospect in the country. But off the field?? Hmmmm. Maybe he can help re-open some recruiting avenues that are, shall we say, somewhat familiar to the program.... Nice work, Larry.   Can you feel it? It's in the air. Football is almost here!!

      Lance Armstrong is under way in his utterly inhuman bid for a sixth consecutive Tour de France victory.  These guys are just ridiculous athletes, and to be taking a shot at a sixth straight crown is simply incomprehensible!  Go Lance Go!  One ... More ... Week!!!

      Today starts NHL Free Agency, and the most notable Lightning unrestricted free agent is Jassen Cullimore.  (Not to say that capt'n Dave isn't notable -- his issue is whether to play, not who for.)  Last I heard before the deadline, the team was offering $2M and Cullimore is looking for $3M.  That's where talks stalled leading up to today.  So, coming off the Stanley Cup win, the team will gamble, letting one of their most important defensemen test the free agent market.  This happened last year with Vinny Prospal, the team's scoring leader the previous season, who ultimately signed with the Ducks.  I thought the team blew it by letting that happen.  I thought they took a fair step backwards during last year's offseason overall.  But then, Prospal ended up miserable in Anaheim, and was hoping to get traded back to the Lightning before this year's trade deadline.  And all the Lightning did was win the Stanley Cup without him.  So, I guess there may be a legitmate reason Jay Feaster is the Lightning GM and I'm not.  I hope that Cully pays attention to Prospal's experience and gives consideration to more than just the salary.  He's been with the team longer than just about any current player.  I'd hate to see him leave.  Oh, and don't you just love seeing ads for Lightning Stanley Cup Champion gear on all the hockey related web sites??
