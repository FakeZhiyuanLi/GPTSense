      ok, so i don't hate summer anymore.  in fact, since resigning myself to the fact that summer can be enjoyable without having an active social life, i've actually had a good time just reading and laying around.  prom wasn't that bad.  just being around people who were in friendly, positive moods (without even being intoxicated!) made me feel really content.  it was fun, especially because most people were actually dancing.  people you wouldn't expect...like...gavin! and...zack! and...me!  everyone looked really nice.  maybe i'll post some pics.  SF! EEE!  we'll be there tomorrow morning! whooohooo.  we get back on wednesday, @ midnight, and then i leave in the morning to maine.  then i get back on the 5th...and the brehms come...and my driving test...and jewels will be here. busybusybusy.  i should start packing.  i hope anyone who happens to read this is having an excellent summer.

      right now, i hate today.  it was a beautiful morning. i went for a walk, picked up some videos.  but now, it's... B L E C H.  last night, danger took us to IHOP.  hahaha, it was a good time.  but right now, i just want to mope. i hate when i get that creeping suspicion that i care about certain things/people more than i should.  i realize that, through that caring, i usually am screwing myself over because i expect it in return.  fuck expectations!  that leads to resentment.  i don't want resentment.

      I think that Javert is the most compelling character in Les Miserables because he is the most complicated--he is not only a victim of society, but of his own inner conflict.  for all that every other character must endure, he suffers the most from his own tortured past.  he wants to do good, for the law, for God, but he righteously abides by these codes of conduct because of his hatred for himself and who he really is. guilt and self disgust is a bitch.    even the problems of Fantine (who i actually feel the worst for) are atleast more straightforward and one-sided.  she atleast has Cosette to live for.  it sucks for Marius to be torn beween his duty to the revolution and his love for Cosette, and it would also be crappy to be in Cosette's position, what with her shitty past, sheltered life, and having to be in love with someone who could go get killed in battle. and, needless to say, anyone who's experienced the melodrama of being a middle school girl can sympathize with Eponine.   but, yeah, Javert is where the depression is at.  in his life there is no triumph, no meaningful purpose, no honesty about who he is and what he wants, and most significantly--no redemption, making him the antithesis of what Jean Valjean stands for.    school is over, yet i feel like writing an analytical essay.  wha tha faaahh!?   but it's all good, cuz i can analyze what i want to! ha!  i'm trying to decide between learning irish gaelic or more french.  if i choose the latter, then attempting to read Les Mis in french could be part of the project.  but gaelic is so...so...fun...and...irish!  i'm going to go walk to blockbuster and rent zoolander, i think.  it's so gorgeous out.  maintenant, J'ADORE L'ETE!!!!!!!!!!!  oooo i just got off the phone with jewels...we talked for like 2 hours...wowee wow...she's gonna be in town sometime in july.  i miss and love julia chenicek korn, so i will post a poem written by maggie estep, julia's 'theme poem,' if you will, in dedication to her existence:  SEX GODDESS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE  I am THE SEX GODDESS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE  so don't mess with me  I've got a big bag full of SEX TOYS  and you can't have any 'cause they're all mine 'cause I'm the SEX GODDESS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.  "Hey," you may say to yourself,  "who the hell's she tryin' to kid,  she's no sex goddess,"  But trust me,  I am  if only for the fact that I have  the unabashed gall  to call  myself a SEX GODDESS, I mean, after all, it's what so many of us have at some point thought, we've all had someone who worshipped our filthy socks and barked like a dog when we were near giving us cause to pause and think: You know, I may not look like much but deep inside, I am a SEX GODDESS.   Only we'd never come out and admit it publicly well, you wouldn't admit it publicly  but I will because I am THE SEX GODDESS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.  I haven't always been  a SEX GODDESS I used to be just a mere mortal woman but I grew tired of sexuality being repressed then manifest in late night 900 number ads where 3 bodacious bimbettes heave cleavage into the camera's winking lens and sigh:   "Big Girls oooh, Bad Girls oooh, Blonde Girls oooh, you know what to do, call 1-900-UNMITIGATED BIMBO ooooh."  Yeah I got fed up with the oooh oooh oooh oooh oooh I got fed up with it all so I put on my combat boots and hit the road with my bag full of SEX TOYS that were a vital part of my SEX GODDESS image even though I would never actually use my SEX TOYS  'cause my being a SEX GODDESS it isn't a SEXUAL thing it's a POLITICAL thing I don't actually have SEX, no I'm too busy taking care of important SEX GODDESS BUSINESS, yeah, I gotta go on The Charlie Rose Show and MTV and become a parody of myself and make buckets full of money off my own inane brand of self-righteous POP PSYCHOLOGY because my pain is different because I am a SEX GODDESS and when I talk, people listen  why ? Because, you guessed it, I AM THE SEX GODDESS OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE and you're not.

      so, i'm actually really considering doing marching band next year.  at first i was, then i wasn't, but now i am thinking about it again...i made a list of pros and cons...oh boy, i don't know, would i be giving up all my dignity? i'd basically do it for the band-nerd-fun social factor, but is that wrong? i don't know.  it would be a big stretch out of my comfort zone...i'd have to conquer my fear of looking stupid (those freakin hats! uniforms!), and do something that i'm pretty  sure i'm incompetent at (marching--i can barely walk without tripping).    it would definitely represent the breaking down of some of my self-set restrictions.  how funny is it that for me, bustin' out involves joining marching band?

      2 more days...  i didn't go to the crew dinner--too much work.  i hope no one feels dissed.  but i doubt anyone noticed.    i took my math quiz in the math lab today, and then i was going to head to badminton...but i started talking with yelena and wolfy, which was just far too compelling to leave behind.  we talked about so much...i will miss talking to wolfy next year, but i guess that's why it's good that i got a marathon discuss-fest in today.  ha.  then mr. reyes came in for the last half hour, and of course he joined in on the discussivities.  i love those teachers, especially when we talk about the challenges of holding onto your beliefs--a faith in humanity, a perserverence for change, a value for critical thought--in the face of an oppressive system and the temptation of money.    i'm laying down some dramatic rhetoric here, i know.  but the bottom line is that it's incredibly refreshing to see that you don't have to become a drone once you graduate from college and get a job.  it almost makes me want to be a teacher.  as crappy as their jobs can be, it's so powerful to be in a position in which you can challenge and encourage kids to actually THINK and not simply be programmed into only giving a shit about themselves.  wolfy got a grant to go to china for a month this summer.  he's researching the underground rock scene in beijing or something like that....so awesome.  and when he gets back, he's moving to *gasp* south orange!  neema will be excited to hear this news. haha.  i should get my arse to bed.  i have to get up for breakfast with ben tomorrow morning, and then it's back to school for some mckim room fun.    au revoir, tout le monde.

      so, my deadjournal's been DEAD for a while.  and, as much as i'd like to say otherwise, i do miss the narcissistic indulgence of a blog.  so pointless, yet i love blathering on and on for the world to see, then being able to look back on it, and think 'allie, that is stupid shit, why do you write these things?' and then write some more.    i have very little work to do before i am comepletely school-free, but that makes it even more difficult to get done.  i have to make up a precalc quiz tomorrow that i have to do work for tonight...and i theoretically should be handing in my revised thesis tomorrow.  but i think cotter will just have to wait for friday.  my thesis is banging.  i want to work on it more this summer and make it real in-depth.  but then i'm lazy.  my topic is, "A Second Gilded Age: How Housing, Income, and the Wealth Gap Reflect a Parallel in Socioeconomic Injustice." WHOOOHOOO, exciting? indeed.  anyway, as easy as it will be for me hammer out a few more paragraphs for it, and as much as i may want to, the fact that i'm SUPPOSED to makes it less tempting.  sheesh. damn stubborn taurus tendencies.  i want this week to be over over over over over EEEEE.    prom is on monday.  that will be....awkward.  i can't believe the limo is a stretch hummer.  that is so gross to me.  i feel like a hypocrit.  but i will suck it up and hopefully it will be fun.  i think it will be, i just feel bad that i will be a bad date--emily dances, and i...well, i do not.  and also, ben and amanda will be there together.  oh boy.  the uncomfortableness is so severe that it's hilarious.  we'll see, we'll see.  and then...san fransisco with ma famille! + joey flanagan, my ex-love.  he's still cool though.  and then....for the 4th of july weekend, i'm going to maine with the jacobys! so amazing.  i fear that my invitation will be withdrawn, because it just seems too good to be true.  and THEN...i get my license on july 8th, if all goes well.  and thheeEeEenn...i go to brown for 3 weeks.  i'm taking a class in conjuction with RISD, on Art and Philosophy.  should be awesomeness.  hopefully ben doesn't find some maplewood pool hoe while i'm gone.   and then probably homework.  but i hope i find time to go camping.  and play the cello. and learn gaelic.  those were my goals last summer too, but instead i was too busy having anxiety attacks. haha.  except it wasn't funny while it was happening.  who has anxiety in the summer?  only big weirdos like me.  i'm trying to decide if i will go to badminton tomorrow.  i would feel bad ditching jono, but i'm tempted to just go to mckim's room instead.  or make up my math quiz that period and get a pass to gym from wolfy.  i'm thinking i might do that.  because...hey! then i could do the stuff for my quiz 7th period rather than tonight! YESSSS. later is always a better time to work than now.  haha.    i just realized that the past year has been the most emotionally stressful of my life.  i mean, i've thought that before, but now that it's fading into the past it's even easier to see that, deeeyamn, this junior year business was full of messed up confusion, mostly that i created.  i'm glad i survived, but i can't help but feel guilty/remorseful for not being able to have the wisdom of hindsight while all of the crazyness was going on.  the crazyness continues, of course, but just...less.  i miss being friends with people that used to make me happy but who now make me feel crappy, i miss being able to be around pete without feeling like i'm going be a big ass pansy and start crying.  but most everything else makes me happy, especially the things/people i would have never even guessed would have been a part of my life a year ago.  i guess that's life.  the more you live the more there is to miss, but there's also more to be happy about.    shit, allie, you profound.
