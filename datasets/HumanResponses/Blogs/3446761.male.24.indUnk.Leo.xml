      Cincinnati, Ohio--A last minute call up, and Dustin Hermanson pitches six strong innings, earns the win and helps the Giants avoid an embarrassing sweep at the hands of the Reds.  He is the eleventh starting pitcher the club has used this season.  He won’t be the last.  Through the gathering of arms from a number of sources, a loose confederacy of hurlers has emerged in San Francisco, causing mayhem on the road to Fresno, their AAA affiliate.  Yet, judging from the standings, the efforts of the supporting cast have been (give or take some decidedly dodgy base running) truly commendable.  Two youngsters in particular have leant a helping arm in trying times.  Now, as heads start to turn toward October, the organization must whittle the number eleven down to the number four.  As of last leek, a solution may be in sight.  Tailored for those of us who demand quality as well as quantity, number twelve just rolled into town.    Outside San Francisco the pitching problems of the Giants have gone relatively unnoticed.  Discussions of the ball club not involving Barry Bonds tend to concern formidable ace Jason Schmidt instead.  Of the post-season contenders, the pitching vitriol is usually reserved for the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals, whose team ERAs stand at 4.60; seventy-five points above the Giants at 3.85.   Indeed, a look at the numbers does little to betray the prevailing wisdom that the Giant’s staff is in good working order.  The starting rotation stands at an impressive 51-32; the bullpen ERA is below 3.50 (fifth in the NL); closer Tim Worrell has converted 25 out of 29 saves.    Closer to home however, Giant’s fans are slightly nervous.  There is a perceived, and real, lack of continuity in the starting rotation; on this matter there is no shortage of armchair criticism. It doesn’t help that across the bay the staff of Oakland is once again the class of the American League.  In San Francisco, with Robb Nenn also on the sidelines, concern seems to have spilled over into the bullpen, despite its solid, if unspectacular, performance.    The Giants have been solid, if unspectacular, for most of the season.  With a bucket-load of experience in most of the appropriate places, the team ranks third in the Majors in fielding percentage and first in one run contests (18-7).  Unfortunately, whilst steady gloves and narrow victories are often the stuff of champions, they can also be the stuff of smoke, and mirrors.            In addition to using eleven different starters, thirteen pitchers have won a game for the Giants this season.  Only the Padres, with fifteen, have more men in the win column.  This could be a testament to the team’s adaptability or its strength in depth; more likely it is a testament to the team’s instability, caused by a steady stream of injuries to pitching personnel.  Giant’s starters have logged 687 innings in 116 games; only seven Major League rotations have thrown less than this.  Apart from Schmidt, no Giant has even thrown 100 innings.   With a number of key position players also hogging the treatment table, it seems that Alou & co. have done well to avoid a rotation-induced meltdown in San Francisco.  The club have used 43 players this season.  It is the most since 1996, when they finished bottom of the division.            					*  Consequently, on Thursday, a few telephone calls were made and reinforcements arrived.  Bringing with him 14 wins (and a knighthood), Sidney Ponson was promptly anointed by MLB.com as the “second half of the most potent pitching duo in baseball.”   Quite a billing for a pitcher with a career record of 55-58, who has never played in either a pennant race or the post-season.  But you might say with the NL West all but sown up, Ponson has plenty of time to make a good impression.  However, as Bobby Valentine knows only too well, commanding leads come, and commanding leads go.    At any rate, the arrival of Ponson marks a critical juncture in the Giants’ season.  It is at the time when the contenders finish tuning and start revving their metaphorical engines.  With this trade, the Giants are making plenty of noise in the NL West.  In many ways, this signing marks the culmination of GM Brian Sabean’s organizational philosophy, and should come as no surprise to Giants aficionados.  In his development plan for the ball club, Sabean has laid great emphasis on pitching.  In the last three drafts, more than 85% of the Giants’ selections have been pitchers.  In 2003, this strategy has brought results both on and off the field.  Crucially therefore, in spite of the questions regarding the rotation, the organization has ended up trading from the very strength that others perceive as a weakness: pitching.    The lengthy process began, however unwillingly, with the exodus of Russ Ortiz in November, and continued on the eve of opening day when the Montreal Expos were paid $3.5 million dollars to take Livan Hernandez.  Last week’s events could be squeezed into a Sabean model of sorts as the Giants outflanked their cash-strapped rivals by offloading the remainder of their pitching surplus.         It all sounds coherent enough, but the reality is a little choppier.  Because of increasing financial constraints, the roles of GMs are characterized more by reaction than action.  Strategies tend to be as much ad hoc as by design, and risks are seldom without consequence.  Ortiz, for example, could win the Cy Young award this year with the Braves; his replacement, Damian Moss, is no longer even a Giant.  Hernandez has thrived in Montreal, where he has won as many games as Jason Schmidt, pitched more innings than any Giant, and thrown four complete games .    In this fragile, victim-rich environment, the deal for Ponson was sealed just ten minutes before the trading doors were slammed shut for the year.  With quality arms in scarce supply, and plenty of willing (if not able) bidders, the Giants have paid their price – and in blood.  In return for Ponson, they have sent Moss, injured Kurt Ainsworth, and touted prospect Ryan Hannaman to Baltimore.  That means that the Giants have effectively traded Ortiz, Moss and Ainsworth for Ponson.  Considering that Ainsworth was declared by Baseball America 2002  to be the fourth most promising pitcher in baseball, and Ortiz paces the Majors with sixteen wins, this was a heavy price indeed.    There is another, even mightier catch.  In a little over two months, Ponson will be eligible for free agency.  The Giants will be hard pressed to hold on to him, particularly if he excels in the pitcher friendly confines of Pacific Bell Park.  For the moment, the native of Arubia adds a meagre $775,000 to the payroll.  With the bankroll already stretched in San Francisco, Ponson proved a suitable candidate by virtue of salary as well as caliber.  Come the fall, his income should increase by a factor of five.  With reports that, in the off-season, up to $10 million in wages will be slashed, Ponson may end up leaving the Giants for the same reason that he arrived.          					*  The fanfare that surrounds Ponson’s arrival is less a case of collective euphoria than it is something of a collective sigh of relief.  Regrettably, Sidney can only represent one fifth of the rotation.  The other four fifths have been in a state of constant flux; with the exceptions of Kirk Rueter and Jason Schmidt, worthy occupants for the starting slots have been hard to find.  The organization has flirted with a number of mediocre options, including Chad Zerbe, Ryan Jensen, Brian Powell, Jim Brower, and Dustin Hermanson.  Zerbe has spent most of this season travelling from San Francisco to Fresno.  Powell, after one unfortunate start in Colorado, was packed off to Philadelphia – indefinitely.  The Giants picked up journeyman Hermanson only after pitcher depraved St Louis released him.  And Brower was on the other end of the “trade” that sent Hernandez to the Expos.  In making four quality starts in five attempts for the Giants, he is the pick of the bunch.  His knack for eating up innings however has been of greater value, by protecting leads and preserving superior arms.  Afflicted by the irony of the traded – and perhaps eroding the convictions of men like Sabean – the consumption of innings is Livan’s bread and butter.      Meanwhile, after just two starts in April, Ryan Jensen was relegated to Fresno, where he has remained since.  Both Jensen and Moss were successful rookies last year, each winning 13 games.  Perhaps, if they had been members of a ball club that could afford to either lose or wait, they (along with Ainsworth) would have been given a longer audition.  But that is, presumably, what separates the Giants from the Orioles: the contenders of today, the contenders of tomorrow.  Not many World Series winning teams, after all, have had more than two youngsters in their starting rotation.  Thus, when in the spring two more rookies emerged to steal the limelight, the fate of their sophomore colleagues was all but sealed.               To great expectations, Jesse Foppert was the first through the door.  After memorable duels with Kevin Millwood, Greg Maddux and Curt Schilling, the talented right-hander was handed a regular slot in the starting rotation.  Then in late May, Kirk Rueter’s recurring shoulder stiffness created an opening for Jerome Williams, who could still develop into a legitimate candidate for rookie of the year .  He has chalked up eighty-two innings with an ERA of 3.02.  Better yet, he has held batters to a miserly .325 slugging percentage – eighth best in the Majors among starting pitchers.  According to Sabean, it is on these healthy shoulders, aged respectively 23 and 22 that the future of the starting rotation lies.  In the meantime, acquiring Ponson will take some pressure off the youngsters in their quest to perform consistently.        In bringing his man to San Francisco, Brian Sabean has proven as ambitious as he is calculating.  Ponson was affordable, but he was costly too.  The real price we will not know until October, because winning the World Series is priceless.  However temporarily, the addition of Ponson will maximise the Giant’s chances.     It may not be enough.  Ultimately there is a difference between Ponson being a good pitcher and the Giants winning the World Series.  Naturally Sabean has both in mind; as is avoiding a repeat of last October.  Since their heart-rending loss in Anaheim, Sabean has tinkered and tailored with a depleted roster, balancing additions both old and new around the offensive fulcrum of Bonds, the defensive pivot of Snow, the golden arm of Schmidt, and the kernel of composure that only veterans bring to a club house.  By raising the stakes, on a player less tried and tested, and potentially less permanent, his latest move presents much more of a gamble.    Still, the starting rotation has been upgraded if not solidified by Sabean’s antics; the bills are all but unblemished; the best blood has been preserved.  If Ponson really is as good as the Giants' scouts say he is, he may become this year's trade of the decade.  With the decade’s player of all time already on their roster, they ought to do well.  The galling reality is that Ponson may win the World Series, but with a different ball-club.  In that case, only Sabean will have to live with his decision.  But he need not worry.  By then we’ll all be clamoring for a return to the ways that served us best: the twelve-man rotation.

      It is the season of good will, and bad contracts.  At times it has been the stuff of Dickens, the artful Dodger, the pick-pocketing of the slightest kind.  It is a similar tale of the rich getting richer, the poor hoping to catch some low-budget magic, and Oakland GM Billy Beane doing his very best impression of Bob Cratchett.  On Wednesday, the New York Yankees did a little more thieving of their own, on this occasion to the Dodgers of Los Angeles.  And then were the winter meetings, usually a hive of trading activity, used this year as a mouthpiece for the clubs with both the money and the inclination to spend it.  Around Christmas time, talk is big; but as we know, the checkbooks of baseballs’ biggest are infinitely bigger.                    Like the sales pitch of the new GMC – “It’s no more than you need, it’s more than you’re used to” – Miguel Tejeda is off in search of richer pastures.  He joins a two hundred strong contingent of GMs, players and agents looking for a match.  In Miguel’s case he has been offered not a GMC, but a Hummer (plus a cool $10 million signing bonus) should he elect to join Baltimore.  With another bunch of players being made available from Dec. 20th through non-tendering, as many as ten Major League ball clubs expanding payroll and a further ten moving it, some teams will be – and have been – getting good in a hurry.  Throw in the considerable fortunes of, to name a few, the Cubs, the Phillies and the Angels, and it seems that for some fans and some players Christmas has well and truly come early.  In New York and Boston, snowmen aside, it most definitely has.  Locked in a situation described by an anonymous GM as a “Russia-U.S nuclear thing,” we have seen that these two do not change the plan; they just change the payroll.  At present the Yankees bullpen, at $37.5m, easily exceeds the entire budget ($32m) of the Milwaukee Brewers, while their pitching staff in its entirety ($81m) is greater than the collective sum of the Braves or the Giants.  Meanwhile, the Red Sox rent-a-pitcher fund has topped the payroll of the World Champion Marlins ($64 versus around $60).  In addition, baseball’s biggest spenders have shelled out a whopping $75 million for the contracts of Kevin Brown and Curt Schilling, whose combined age is 77.  Now, were the blockbusting A-Rod for Manny Ramirez trade to be completed, the Red Sox could join their bitter rivals in the exorbitant annals of $150 million club.  Come 2004, with their recent acquisitions, the behemoths of the AL East look all but invincible.                  Away from the realm of fantasy payrolls, in San Francisco it is said that money is short, and timing is everything.  A month ago, as of Nov. 14th, seasonal cheer for Giants fans has most likely come and gone.  On this day, to the tune of How the Grinch stole Pierzynski, GM Brian Sabean swooped from the shadows to nab the Twin’s all-star catcher from under the noses of the newly competitive San Diego Padres.  Sporting a career average of .311, a career road average of .328, and an OPS (on base% + slugging%) that reads .763, .773, .824 over the last three years, the 27 year old A.J.Pierzynski will add production, another left handed bat and just $2.5 million to the aging San Francisco line-up.          Unfortunately with Joe Nathan no longer around to play Santa Claus, and Rob Nenn’s little helper, Tim Worrell off to Philadelphia, the Giants need to acquire another right handed reliever.  The bullpen that includes Jim Brower, Matt Herges, Felix Rodriguez, Scott Eyre and Jason Christiansen will be significantly bolstered by Nenn’s precarious return, but at $9 million, he diminishes the club’s spending options.  Last season the seven Major League closers with at least 38 saves averaged a salary of $6.4 million; top man Eric Gagne, who only now has the leverage of arbitration, made a paltry $550,000.  Should the Giants have extended the same privilege to Worrell, who was also a member of the 38 saves club, he would have easily doubled his $2 million salary and, consequently, priced himself well beyond the club’s limited means.    Next, the Giants will look to find a starting pitcher to shore up a rotation that looks a little thin after Jason Schmidt, Kirk Reuter and Jerome Williams.  The memories of Kurt Ainsworth and his successor, Sidney Ponson, are vivid.  Ploughing through the list of free agents, the brass have considered ex-Colorado southpaw Darren Oliver, Oakland favorite Cory Lidle, and San Francisco’s own, Shawn Estes, as potential candidates.  Already gone is Giant slayer Miguel Batista, who would have been an excellent fit.  Durable, consistent and experienced, he signed for the Blue Jays instead for the relatively modest price of $13 million over three years.  The Giants were not involved in negotiations.  Another possibility is Jeff Suppan, who dominated national league hitters last season, and has pitched over six hundred innings since 2001, should fetch around $3 million.  As far as potential trades go, San Francisco is out of options; they have a handful of minor league position players, but they are more solid than spectacular.  The organization is determined to hold onto the few pitching prospects they have left.     The club is also looking to improve its options at shortstop, described by Sabean as “a work in progress.”  The incumbent is Neifi Perez; a defensive whiz, but an offensive pip-squeak.  With only Barry Bonds tallying over 20 home runs in 2003, and would be sluggers Andres Galarraga (12) and Jose Cruz (20) discarded, the Giants are sorely in need of legitimate power.  Despite his impressive 16 home runs and 48 RBIs in 232 at bats this year – the ratio of 14.7 at bats per home run was good enough for 7th place in the NL – it would be foolhardy to pin the offensive hopes of the Giants on the shoulders of Pedro Feliz.  His poor judgment of the strike zone yielded a mediocre .278 on base percentage, and he was the only Major Leaguer to accumulate more homers than walks (10).  Feliz however continues to show promise, particularly in clutch situations and against superior pitching.          Last week, to plug the gold-glove sized hole in right field – and provide Felipe Alou with a few more outfield options – the club signed two experienced players.  It sounds exciting enough, but if you were to ask the Giant’s wily coach about Jeffrey Hammonds and Michael Tucker, he would probably say something that does not include the words “just what we were hoping for”.  Last month in fact Barry Bonds, in the spirit of impunity that seems to follow him, said exactly what every shortsighted Giant fan wants to hear: “It’s time to put up.”   In response to his belligerent superstar slugger, Sabean issued a veiled you do your job, and I’ll do mine plea:                “If he’s got a better way to do this – and I’m saying all this with all due respect – I’m open minded.”                As always, Mr. Bonds is at his best at the plate, not in quotation marks.  Indeed, before lambasting the establishment for its tightfistedness, he would do well do bear in mind that his princely $16.7 million represents almost a quarter of the club’s money-pot.  Judging from his numbers (as well as his arms) that doesn’t necessarily seem unfair, but a modest pay-cut could go a long way toward ensuring a post-Bonds legacy at Pacific Bell Park. Until Bond’s retirement however, his is the only option the Giants can entertain.   Needless to say, asking sports stars to take pay cuts is implausible, some would say treasonous.  It is Oliver Twist asking for more; it is what George Steinbrenner is to Ebenezer Scrooge.   The Giants will improve, whilst honoring their organizational pledge not to throw better money after good.  Accepting that they won’t win the World Series next year, they are not going to be punished for not putting their hands in their pockets.  There is method in this approach.  In contrast to the go-getting attitudes of some GMs, like Theo Epstein, Ed Wade and Arte Moreno, Sabean believes that patience and restraint are the keys to off-season success:     “Time is going to be our best ally," he said. "We've been pretty good [at acquiring players] in January, and potentially it's a buyer's market.  But…we won’t be the only attractive team guys will want to go to."   There are a multitude of choices available, which is causing concern among agents with mid-level players as the days roll by. Talk is plentiful, yet offers are few and most teams, like the Giants, are hoping to save by not overspending early.  In reality, a handful of teams will not be spending at all, let alone early.  The annual turning of the financial screw hits the smaller franchises hardest, as they see their most valuable assets prized from them at either sales prices or via free agency, which, other than saving dollars affords them no form of compensation.  Thus Minnesota’s hallowed bullpen has been stripped of its firemen, Latroy Hawkins and Eddie Guardado, to the delight of the Cubs and the Mariners respectively.    To accommodate the strain that winning a World Series places on a payroll (see last year’s Angels), The Marlins could only afford to keep one of the trio of Mike Lowell, Derek Lee (also to the Cubs) and Ivan Rodriguez.  Next year Florida will also be devoid of the talents of Juan Encarnacion, Mark Redman and appropriately nicknamed Urgueth – “you get what you pay for” – Urbina.  In fact, he is much more than the Marlins are used to paying.  But a closer is unlike the GMC SUV, because everyone is used to having one.  And you can never have too many closers in the bullpen – just ask Seattle, Philadelphia, even Boston.  We all know of teams with dreams that died in September for lack of an ironclad ninth-inning presence.  The Marlins meanwhile, closer or committee, will not be seeing October baseball in 2004, even if Josh Beckett wins 25 games.        Similarly in Oakland, the Athletics have little to shout about.  With Ted Lilly and Ramon Hernandez long gone and both Tejeda and Keith Foulke already with an arm and a leg in the glitzy AL East, Billy Beane and his cronies will have to write more than a bestseller to get out of this jam.  Following the imminent loss of their third closer in as many years, Beane will probably opt for a cheap, dependable veteran to close all deals.  Oakland also needs a catcher with the experience to get the most out of the young and immensely gifted starting rotation.                        Unsurprisingly, Montreal is in the off-season losing column after reluctantly parting with their two best players, Javier Vazquez and Vladimir Guerrero.  There the market, with its abundance of free agent front line starting pitching, worked against Expos GM Omar Minaya, as potential suitors for Vazquez dried up.  After being informed that his ace would not be resigning at the end of next season, and with the game’s elite starters frantically swapping seaboards, Minaya was forced to take the Yankees insufficient offer of Nick Johnson, cash, and minor league entourage.    Back in the NL West, the Giants are still waiting.  Four of the division’s five teams are either downsizing or trimming payroll; it is neither necessary nor economical to chase elaborate upgrades.  At the same time it is both ludicrous and satisfying that the biggest challenge to San Francisco in 2004 could come from retooling San Diego, who finished a colossal 36½ games off the pace in 2003.  During last month – in what has become a critical move – the Padres aggressively pursued but failed to clinch a deal for Pierzynski.  While they pondered their next move, the Giants moved in, adding an all-star caliber insult to San Diego’s injury, and tipping the 2004 scales more firmly in San Francisco’s favor.  Sabean, at any rate, appears confident that his roster is competitive, and moving in the right direction:  “If we can tweak our starting pitching and keep our bullpen intact, with our defense, we’re as good as or better than last year’s ball club, believe or not, all around the diamond.”  Of the thirty Major League franchises this off-season, a third are adding payroll, a third are subtracting, and a third are maintaining their 2003 levels.  In other words, some are adding, some are being divided, and some are subtracting in order to add.   As for the Yankees and the Red Sox, with their multiples of payrolls, it is reminiscent of a certain episode of Itchy and Scratchy.  The two enemies, facing off, take turns to draw ever bigger guns.  Soon, the earth is eclipsed by the size of their weapons.  Next season, with room for only one World Champion, who will pull the trigger?  With so much as stake, it will all end in tears – presumably in Boston.  In the meantime, I hope someone has told Tiny Tim that Keith won’t be coming home for Christmas.  Come March, with his magic returning at first base, the people of San Francisco can at least say there was J.T.Snow in December.    It is the season of good will.  But the season that never ends is baseball.

      Aside from their mediocre starting pitching, anaemic offense and patchy defense, the Giants are suffering above all from the weight of inflated expectations.  When GM Brian Sabean famously referred to some of his teams' critics as a "lunatic fringe" somehow, in the shuffle, the point of their complaint was missed. It is becoming clearer (despite an improving string of results) that they were at least voicing a legitimate gripe: Without the addition of a big bat, otherwise known as Vladimir Guerrero, the Giants could not realistically hope to contend during--and certainly not beyond--the regular season.   Sadly, additions were never in the pipeline, because of that perennial spanner in the works: Payroll. The Giants  urlLink roster  ($82m) is already among the most expensive in the majors. Yet this has little to do with talent, and more with desparation. On the heels of the heartbreaking loss to the Angels in 2002, mistakes were made.   Now the Giant's hands are well and truly tied, as they have been for a while. This is because the decisions Sabean and co. made in the fall of 2002 were predicated on the belief that the Giant's were already strong enough to contend in 2003-4 with only the addition of a few veterans to play key roles. For the most part this worked in 2003, but not without consequences.   Unfortunately, this premise was false, and the repercussions dire. It all started with the run to the World Series: timing their form to perfection, the Giants pleasantly over-achieved in 2002. The assets of this team were then dealt--out of complacency, not thrift. The club lost Jeff Kent, David Bell, Reggie Sanders and Jay Witascik among others to free agency; Traded Russ Ortiz for Damian Moss, and donated Livan Hernandez for a reliever to be named Jim Brower. After being  forced  to let go Ortiz because of his $5m salary, the Giants promptly offered Kirk Reuter a three year $16m extension. Still believing that they could contend in 2003 the Giants added Neifi Perez, Ray Durham and Edgardo Alfonzo at the horrendous price of $16.5 per year.   Because of this, the payroll on opening day 2003 was the same as it had been in 2002. The team was decidly worse, and only the weakest of divisions--and some promising starting pitching--allowed the weakness to go unexposed. In July 2003, at a premium, the Giants bribed Sidney Ponson temporarily from Baltimore, and in the fall the last drop of young blood was squeezed from the system (Joe Nathan et al) in the acqusition of A.J.Pierskyni.   Meanwhile, off the field the greatness of Barry Bonds has also led to inflated expectations. Most fans-- especially  Giants fans--don't seem to realize that it takes more than the second best player ever to win it all. They don't understand that there's a reason why teams can't win  every  year. But the organization has neglected the areas that need the most attention. Now, with a lack of depth in the starting rotation, the offense and the farm system, the Giants are might be in the worst shape since Bonds came here in 1992.

      With Ray "How's my Hamstring?" Durham making his fourth trip to the DL in the past two seasons, the Giants now have a tidy 30% of their payroll twiddling their proverbial thumbs.  The $9m man, Rob Nenn may never pitch again. J.T.Snow, of course,  should  never play again—-at least not outside Fresno.    One the one hand it's comforting to see the Giant's division rivals up in smoke. Take Richie Sexson for example, out for the season, and probably Arizona too. Before the season started, Arizona were considered by many as the dark horse of the division. Los Angeles' offense has been strained once again by Shawn Green's dodgy shoulder. San Diego lost their prize free agent signing--and ace--David Wells, for a month. The plaudits however must go to the Giants, for whom it will take more than a few domestic incidents with  urlLink barstools  to trump their collection of limping misfits.   Since the management shelled out a princely sum of $7.2m per year for his services, Ray Durham has missed more than eight times as many games (80) as he has stolen bases (9); At present, Barry Bonds leads the team with three thefts (as well as every other feasible category). When Durham returns for another spell, Felipe Alou would do well to put him in the No. 5 slot. As well as stealing only nine bases since he became a Giant, he has also been  caught  precisely nine times. With 30 doubles in 410 ABs last year, it's clear he'd better placed driving runs than in getting on base.   As for the lead-off role, who knows, but it's gotta be someone other than Neifi Perez with his on base percentage of 0.260. With Perez's salary ($2.75m) Brian Sabean could buy himself a whole team of Khalil Greenes.

      Not only are our memories short. They are selective too. So it is that Pedro Feliz is the Giant's new pin-up, leading the team with 27 RBIs and showing decent pop with 8 HRs. He also has a team-leading three sons.    The case for the hybrid first-third baseman follows that what separates Feliz from becoming a legitimate power hitter is experience, namely 450 plus ABs in a season. Last year, with him belting 16 Home Runs in 249 Plate Appearances, the leadership resolved to give him his chance. The twist is that he has found himself batting in the No. 5 slot, behind the fellow who happens to get on base around two times out of three.   Unfortunately for the Giants and Feliz, 27 RBIs is merely average for a guy who gets as many opportunities as he does. He has appeared at the plate with runners on base around half the time (46%), and in scoring position about a third (30%). Of his 8 home runs, a grand total of one has driven in Bonds; in games where he has homered, the Giants are 3-5. For those in the jury still out, another look at the numbers might put to rest any rumor that this is THE guy for the clean-up-clean-up role.   *  Feliz has grounded into a ML highest 7 double plays--4 of them     with the bases loaded.  *  He is batting 0.210 (12 for 57) with Runners in Scoring Position.  *  Swing Selection: Averaging just 2.86 pitches per at bat, Feliz's bat ranks     among the most hot-handed in the majors.  *  Thus far this season, Feliz has two walks. Bonds averages two walks  per game.   *  He has struck out 34 times, a K/BB ratio of 17.     At this rate, he's on course for 130 strikeouts vs. 10 walks. Oh dear.   Contrary to popular opinion (aka Mike Krukow) Feliz is decidedly not the plug for the Giants leaky offense. Bonds needs the protection of an elite hitter, one who is able to work counts, hit the ball to all fields and above all, capitalize on pitchers mistakes. All too often Feliz's inexperience, even ineptitude, at the plate will cost the team outs, particularly against the better pitchers who will pitch to him on their own terms. They know Pedro will come out--indeed strikeout--swinging.  In short, he is not displaying any sign of evolving into what the Giants need him to be: A clutch hitter with pop. For that, Felipe Alou would much have someone like his son, Moises, in the lineup.

      Coors Field. In a slugfest more akin to a video game than a Major League contest, the Giants and the Rockies combined for eight home runs, and nineteen runs on Friday night.  It is, therefore, somewhat surprising therefore that the most spectacular abuse of the evening was reserved for the  urlLink Colorado batters  who, over the course of six sumptuous courses of Jason Schimdt, struck out nine times and failed to log an extra base hit in a game that saw eleven of them. The Giants used three relievers, who combined to give up four home runs. Schmidt's performance, by contrast, was all the more impressive on the back of a first inning that took him 36 pitches to complete.   Attributing his Rocky start to  "Trying to be too pin-point" , Schmidt proceeded to mow down the next eight Colorado batters, striking out five. In doing so, he demonstrated-and not for the first time-those battle instincts that only Cy Young candidates are capable of mustering. His  urlLink WHIP (walks+hits/innings pitched) is the third lowest among starting pitchers in the Major Leagues, at 0.98--less than one baserunner per inning.   If only Schmidt's exploits were backed up by his team-mates. Yet the Giant's pitching staff are safe in knowledge that there is usually someone worse: Sure enough, the Rockie's pitching staff is borderline diabolical. But the Giants have done their best thus far to match them, appearing among the  urlLink league leaders  in almost every significant category, including hits allowed, fewest strikeouts, bullpen apprearances and ERA. Giant's fans might be used to seeing Barry Bonds humiliate opponents-and teammates-with his swing, but on this day, Schmidt stood out like a sore thumb on a broken hand.  With seven wins in his last  urlLink eight starts , 69 strikeouts and an ERA of 1.86 in those games, Schmidt-and Schmidt alone-has kept this sodden ship from sinking. If that seems unbelievable, take a look across the Bay: There's a difference between winning ballgames, and not losing them.

      Matt Herges mas 16 saves, the third most in the National League. Unfortunately, that doesn't make him the third best closer. Saves indicate only the ballgames that have been relatively close. At the same time, some saves are clearly tougher than others: Finishing a 3-2 game with runners on the corners and no outs is worth no more than a 3-0 game with no men on and two outs. In short, saves are not a good yardstick for performance.   And just in case you would be led to believe that, overall, the total number of saves can provide a guide to who's hot and who's not, take a quick glimpse at the leaderboard. Danny Graves leads the majors with 21. Eric Gagne, on the other hand, has only 13. Keith Foulke has pitched scoreless ball on 21 out of 23 appearances for the Red Sox, but has only 10 saves.   The numbers however, as they often do, present something of a double-edged sword. For Herges has done a lot more than blow four saves in seventeen chances this season. When the rejoicing over his  urlLink worlds' strongest man  celebration has abated, take a closer look at the Giant's closer. I've thrown in two other soft-tossing closers for contrast: Jose Mesa, the pundits' perennial whipping boy; and Tim Worrell, another player whom the Giant's couldn't afford to keep, and couldn't afford to lose.   . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  Matt Herges  . . .  Jose Mesa  . . .  Tim Worrell  . . .  Opp. On Base Ave: . . . . .  . 370 . . . . . . . . . . 274 . . . . . . . . . 289 . . . . . . .

For them, because of the lack of depth in the rotation, opportunities to win games will be fewer and further between. With Herges on the mound in 2004, there is a 38% chance that any hitter will reach base. That's beyond precarious. It's suicidal.

      Wednesday--a tale of two matchups. On the face of it, few would argue that Barry Bonds squaring off against Randy Johnson is tantamount to baseball in a nutshell. On the one hand, five Cy Young awards, a perfect game and 94 strikeouts this season. On the other seven MVP awards, 63 walks and an eight game Home Run streak in 2004. Men like these are modern gladiators. And it's a travesty that they're not fighting for anything except the wooden spoon.  Instead then, I watched the rising, brightly shining stars of the game as they clashed in a flurry of noise, energy and expectation. Anaheim, CA, and not for the first time. Despite the slow-motion feats of Mr. Bonds and his underlings, the Giants are simply not an exciting team to watch. Casey Kotchman and Pedro Martinez on the other hand duelled for five whole minutes--and sixteen pitches--as if their very salaries depended on it. Vladimir Guerrero, whose  urlLink 9 RBIs  set a new franchise record, is without doubt the most precocious talent in the game: A man whose reach defies the laws of the strike zone, and a superior athlete who strains to hide his boyish delight as he huddles in the dugout to the acclaim of his team mates. These guys seem a lot more excited than San Francisco and their aloof, sullen contingent. Manny Ramirez meanwhile adds a more textbook interpretation to the proceedings, golfing a ball in a glorious arc to center field.    The list goes on, all to the sounds (and cheers, unlike SBC) of fans who have come not only to be entertained, but to enjoy the game in all its joyous unpredictability. Joe Morgan adds depth and dignity to the play. In Arizona on the other hand, to the testosterone-fueled sounds of Krukow and Kuiper, nothing is learned--and even less is worth watching as two teetering franchises rest uneasily on the laurels of their respective unholy player.   Aged 81 between them, this is the summation not only of these teams collective talent, but their collective charm. Dressed in grey, playing to an audience either unwilling or uncaring, these poor fellows look like ghosts among ordinary men. It seems these are the games decided not by great feats of skill, but by mistakes. It's sad to say, but I'm tired of waiting to see whose day it won't be.

      In Texas Hold'em, an Ace is often enough to win on its own. In baseball, most of the time you'll also need a king, a queen and a host of deuces that are wild. Not in the case of Jason Schmidt. The anchor of the Giant's starting rotation Schmidt--despite shoulder surgery--has all the credentials an Ace should need. These include:   *   Throwing long: At least six innings every start. Schmidt has averaged 7.8 this season, third most in the National League.  *   Throwing well, and often: Quality Starts (six innings, three or fewer earned runs) in over 75% of games.    *   Intimidating the opposition: see below.  *   Winning: Regardless of No-Decisions, the team should win two out of three games in which the Ace takes to the mound. Since joining the Giants, San Francisco have won 74% (58-20) of the games Schmidt has started--the best ratio in the majors. This season in nine starts, Schmidt has six wins: In 26 starts Kirk Reuter, Brett Tomko and Dustin Hermanson have three  between them .      Schmidt indeed does all the above, with aplomb. To boot, he strikes out more opposing hitters than he allows hits and walks combined (65 vs. 63). His fastball is a model of consistency, yet witness the Padres, whom he beat with only his curve and changeup in April. And anyone who saw Schmidt's ruthless demolition of the Rockies on Sunday needn't ask MLB Home Run leader Jeromy Burnitz if he's  intimidating  ... .     If there was any question as to who is the Giants most valuable player, let that claim be put to rest. Barry Bonds might well be the most accomplished hitter in the history of the game. The problem is, if he's not on the line up, he can't hit--no matter  how  good he is.     Jason Schmidt, of course, appears only every fifth game. Yet his impact is felt quite literally by the beleaguered bullpen, who usually are spared the standard four-inning outing that follows the rest of the rotation. By the same token, his every start takes pressure off the offense, which has up this point failed to score consistently. In spite of the recent upturn, only the Expos have scored fewer runs than the Giants in the National League. Furthermore, the outlook for offense is cloudy, even bleak. Thus it is essential that the hitters can reassure themselves that, on any given Schmidt-day, two or three runs will be sufficient.     Come October, there may not be any baseball in the Bay Area, even if the A's win 90 games. It will be, in that very likely case, a travesty--and a telling one at that. Before the Marlins, on their World Championship run, ran all over their big-name opponents Schmidt, with an ruptured elbow, threw a three-hit shutout to open the NLDS series. His opponent on that day? A hitherto unheralded stud, Josh Beckett.  urlLink "The Ace of the future,"  someone said--and everyone agreed. Three weeks later, he was picking up his World Series ring, and MVP award. Schmidt, by contrast, will be remembered as the man who seldom lost: and never really won.

      In all probability, anyone with an afternoon to waste would have a hard time telling the difference between the Giants and the Devil Rays. In fact, without Barry Bonds the Giants more or less  are  the Devil Rays--although with considerably less potential. From their flaky offense to decidedly dicey bullpen, from streaky defense to one and a half man rotation, these teams have a lot in common: Give or take the $53m difference in  urlLink payroll . On Thursdsay, with their perennial difference maker on the sidelines (or rather, nowhere in sight) the Giants struggled to break free of their .500 price tag. In games without Bonds in the lineup, the Giants are 4-9.    Not that anyone is asking questions. As of Friday Bonds, and his crippling $18m, has missed almost a quarter (22%) of the team's games. That's not good. It's also worth noting that no team in history has won the World Series with a player who has taken up more than 15% of the team's payroll. Barry's share of the proverbial pie is the same  same as his truency rate: 22%. The only one whose absence is more conspicuous than the No. 25 is Robb Nen. At $9m, he accounts for 11% of the budget--and at least 20% of the team's success.

      The Giants are making the most of their opposition these days. With their last six series coming against the-ahem-Expos, Rockies (twice), D-Backs (twice) and as of today the D-Rays, Felipe Alou's men must consider themselves lucky not to be dead and buried in the NL West. With rumors that less than two weeks ago GM Brian Sabean was on the verge of  urlLink breaking up the team , it has only one scapegoat--Jeffrey Hammonds--to show for it. Said Sabean:   "I was dead serious. We had to do something to stem the tide, and they did it themselves. I was very close to doing something, but they saved themselves from themselves."    Not very encouraging. With the 7-3 win today, the Giants have pulled into a season-tying best two games above 500. After being swept at home by Pittsburg, they have won 15 of their last 20 games, and five out of their last six series. It won't last. Indeed, judging from the  urlLink schedule , the Giants little revolution will be as shortlived as it was improbable. Unfortunately for now, instead of dealing for (among other things) a reliable starting pitcher, the team has been left virtually intact--give or take the rise and fall of a few unlofty prospects. Sabean will be unwilling to make trades because he knows his team is too far behind in the race to catch up. The race for the division is so wide open that the Giants don't  need  to increase the payroll. Sabean then could be sure of at least one thing: without his help the Giants will be comdemned to come completely unstuck, completely unassisted.

      A series at Mile High Stadium can do so much for team--at least part of it. It can, for example, turn Neifi Perez into an 15 homer, 80 RBI man. It can negate forty games of paltry productivity with a glut of hits that turn victories into propagandas routs. Alas, don't be fooled. An RBI in a 1-1 game doesn't beat a grandslam when it's 10-1.    So it is, with the season a third in the drawer, that the Giants go into inter-league play marginally--even miraculously--outside the line of fire. That will change once teams with winning records (i.e. the BlueJays and the RedSox) roll into town. For now, they're stocking up on brownie points.    Before the series at Coors, where the team scored 53 runs on 51 hits with 9 HRs and 30 walks, the Giants offense was  urlLink dwelling in the NL basement : As a team San Francisco was hitting .253, 11th in the league; had scored 203 runs, 15th in the league; had hit 46 home runs, 13th in the league, and so on.   Perhaps most ignominously of all, the Giants have ground into 54 double-plays, worst in the majors. They're on course to break the MLB record of 152 in a season. Yet incredibly, only the Padres have left more men on base than San Francisco (7.7 per game). The Giant's base-running exploits my help explain this. As of June 2nd, they had stolen just 13 bases in 49 games. In case you were wondering, that's also the worst in the majors.   Double plays and stolen bases however are one thing. Timely hitting is quite another. If failure is your standard, then the Giant's exel at all in three departments. With  urlLink runners in scoring position  San Francisco is hitting a ominous .230. Timely hitting eludes the Giants like a plague--without it, they won't make the post-season.

      It’s about that time of year. The Yankee’s lead in the AL East is 3.5 games—and growing. Why? Again?! You might ask.    Pitching, I might answer. Despite the vaunted Boston rotation, the Red Sox and Yankees pitchers appear evenly matched. After 550 innings of work, their difference in WHIP (walks + hits / IP) is disturbingly negligible: Boston 1.32, New York 1.31. They have logged team ERAs of 3.98 and 4.36 respectively, 2nd and 4th in the league. So it’s not just the standings that should make Red Sox fans nervous, because in recent weeks, the Yankee’s pitchers have caught up. And the closer they come, the further they stretch their lead. At the end of April Boston, thanks in no small part to their bullpen, were the best in The Show with an ERA of 2.95—a mammoth 1.37 runs better than New York—and were holding opposing batters to a miserly .224 average. It couldn’t last. It didn’t. (Numbers denote AL rank)    March/April   ______IP___ERA__SV__H__BB__SO_WHIP_SLUG_BB/9_K/BB_H/9_K/9   1.Bos  198.1 .2.95 . 7/8 . 164 .82 . 156 . 1.24 . .  . 347 . 3.72 . 1.80 7.44 7.08  4.N Y    204.0 .4.32 . 9/10 .210 .67 . 142 . 1.36 . .  . 430 . 2.96 . 2.00 9.26 7.26  The month of May was tough on both teams’ pitchers, with Boston’s starters showing signs of mortality, and New York’s offense signs of life. The Yankees’ staff quietly improved on their impressive command (BB/9,K/BB—usually a good barometer for success) while the Red Sox found themselves being hit both harder and considerably more often (see H/9).     May   ______IP___ERA__SV__H__BB__SO_WHIP_SLUG_BB/9_K/BB_H/9_K/9   7.Bos  265.0 .4.55 . 5/7 . 278 .76 . 191 . 1.34 . .  . 416 . 2.58 . 2.40 9.44 6.49  8.N Y    235.0 .4.66 10/13 .251. 60 . 137 . 1.32 . .  . 420 . 2.29 . 2.00 9.55 5.23  This month, as the two staffs find themselves on the brink of statistical convergence, the Yankees have begun to capitalize. With their offensive juggernaut continuing to gather steam, the rotation has begun to turn in stronger and longer performances.  Sometime this week, Yankee starters will overtake Red Sox starters in total innings pitched, despite using nine different ones this year (ten as of Tuesday), including the dicey Donovan Osborne on two occasions. The Red Sox rotation has been less democratic, but no less problematic. Behind Martinez and Schilling (more than 90 innings apiece) the rotation lacks horses as well as performances. Tim Wakefield has been largely inconsistent, while Derek Lowe, with just 63 innings in 12 starts, is probably wondering what he was thinking when he declined the $27m the Sox offered him in the spring.    June   ______IP___ERA__SV__H__BB__SO_WHIP_SLUG_BB/9_K/BB_H/9_K/9   9.Bos  .96.0 . 4.50 . 3/5 . 101 .34 . .64 . 1.41 . .  . 399 . 3.19 . 1.80 .9.47 6.00  6.N Y    111.0 . 3.81 . 8/8 . 113 .27 . .78 . 1.26 . .  . 379 . 2.19 . 2.70 .9.16 6.32  The Yankee’s pitching staff is, ominously, starting to jell. Anchored by Javier Vazquez and Kevin Brown (in that order), and with the return to form of Mike Mussina (unbeaten since April 22) and a healthy John Lieber, that’s a lot of innings. With Mariano Rivera on hand to close all deals, it’s a lot of wins. Keith Foulke, for his part, has a 1.08 ERA yet only 13 saves. The Yankees have 27. In June their pitchers have posted better numbers across the board than have Boston’s, whilst continuing their decline in hits allowed, walks issued, and opposing slugging. If they continue to improve, the race for October could be over by September. Indeed, with little separating the Boston and New York offenses (OBP of .355 and .354; slugging .442 and .457) and pair of reliever corps than are borderline ironclad, the war in the East will be fought, and won, in the rotation. This is perhaps where the numbers perhaps tell us the most. Yankee’s starters have posted a 30-15 ledger. Boston’s, meanwhile have gone 27-21. In the end, quantity as well as quality—probably in the form of a bonafide fifth starter—should emerge to decide this, the tightest of races. It’s a great opportunity for some unlikely heroes. A resurgent Byung-Hyun Kim? David McCarty pitching seven scoreless frames and fielding first? El Duque, anyone?

      Special for  Giant Matters  by  Max Knoblauch        With their tenth win in eleven games, the Giants stand like a Colossus astride the NL West. Strangely unsatisfied--like a pack of rabid dogs--in tonights victory against LA they tried their luck instead at starting a fight. It was a tame affair, with Jeff Weaver besting Michael Tucker over who would get to talk to Bip Roberts after the game.   Now a miraculous eight games over .500, Felipe Alou's men have exploited their weaker opponents with ease both surprising and, at times, clinical. The offense has turned tight ballgames into blowouts, and the starting pitching, led by Jason Schmidt, has elevated. The Giants have won in six of Dustin Hermanson's last seven outings, while Kirk Rueter's ERA is 3.53 over his last eight, and Jerome Williams is quietly fortifying his future in the game's elite, as he puts together both innings and victories.   The bullpen meanwhile lacks both character and focus. Ask Scott Eyre, who suffers from ADD. He says he picks a spot, and stares at it. Nice one. Matt Herges on the other hand is a Collins ballad just waiting to happen. Don't get me wrong:  In Too Deep  is a Bateman favorite, but will it help you throw strikes? Of course Herges enters his  critical  game situations not to the haunting tones of  Silent Running , but instead to the diabolical muzak of  Rush . Herges, not one to be outdone, reassured the media in May that he checked the lyrics  "To see if they weren't dirty, or nothin'."  As usual, he was half right.   But it's not just Itchy and Scratchy in this 'pen that suffer from afflictions of the brain. Opposing teams are starting to realise that the oafish Giants rabble who resemble relief only in name are, from man to man, the very same pitcher. Tyler, Jason, Wayne and Jim all too throw the same pedestrian garbage. Someone should throw in Paul Allen's corpse to make matters a little cheerier. Even Felix "Down the Pipe" Rodriguez looks alarmingly like his would-be bullpen friends (they  really  don't like him), as he suffers stoically--as they do--from the same crippling nervousness. Intimidation has long run dry in this camp. It will have a part to play along the road ahead--just as, no doubt, will  Throwing it all Away .

       &nbsp; A glimpse at the Giant's division rivals always begins with the  Dodgers .  By  Neale Fenn .   Two months ago, the Los Angeles Dodgers came to San Francisco. In the twinkle of an eye, they left town in celebration of not only a series sweep, but also an eight game lead over their arch enemies. All the plaudits went out to Jim Tracy's men, with their Bradley-energized offense and Gagne-clad pitching staff.   What a difference a month makes. By the middle of May it was clearer that the Dodgers, starting with Dave Roberts&nbsp;vs. Juan Pierre, were no Marlins in the making. Juan Encarnacion, sadly, is not the RBI machine the Dodgers hoped he would be. There's more wrong with Shawn Green than his back. Bradley, while clearly not lacking in ability,&nbsp;is an&nbsp;0-20&nbsp;in waiting. All in all, the front office don't think much of the lineup -- and have said so behind closed doors.   This is, after all,&nbsp;an offense that ranks second in the National League in  urlLink Batting Average , yet second  last  in runs scored. The team is slugging .412, 12th in the league. Alex Cora is suddenly leading the line in the  Players to Watch  columns.  urlLink Alex Cora ?   Then there's the starting rotation that features the likes of Hideo Nomo (7.56 ERA), Jose Lima, and Jeff "ease the pressure" Weaver.  As if  LA fans have&nbsp;much&nbsp;to hope for. This team is chock-a-block full of holes. And when eventually Eric Gagne blows a save -- presumably some time in 2012 -- there'll be trouble brewing, even in the 'pen.   In the end, of course, these boys can play well enough to win the division. And,  dare I say it , they probably will. Although there's no shortage of mediocrity in Los Angeles, there's as much room for improvement&nbsp;here as in either San Diego or Francisco.&nbsp;And if it&nbsp;comes down to&nbsp;(as it usually does)&nbsp;the preservation of leads,&nbsp;then it's a simple equation:&nbsp;Gagne, Hoffman or Herges.   Game Over.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Once you get past the idea that Cody Ransom will never be a major leaguer, the Giant's infield has surprising depth. Unlike their division rivals, San Francisco have, at each position, players who can either hit or field. That may be something of a truism, but it's also something of a relief. For this team may not have any virtuoso double-play tandem, nor any bonafide gold-glovers (J.T.Snow doesn't hit well enough to earn one), there is that unmistakable blend of youth, experience, pop and glovework, making the entourage competitive, if not championship caliber.    Behind the plate, Yorvit Torrealba has nothing to prove other than that he can hit above .250. Defensively, he's twice the catcher A.J.Pierzynski is. A.J., on the other hand--whose real name no one seems to know--is no slouch with the glove, unless someone has a stolen base in mind. At 16%, he throws out the fewest runners in the Majors. Up the middle, Neifi Perez has at last been removed from the starting lineup, coinciding, uncoincidentally, with the team's offensive upturn.   But the real difference maker for the Giants is a healthy Ray Durham. He is to San Francisco as oil is to an engine (see Jeff Kent). With Durham in the lineup this year, the team is 25-11. The inclusion of his bat makes the job of Michael Tucker and Evergreen Grissom that much easier. Instead of finding ways to get on base (a difficult task for Marquis, who hits well but seldom walks), these two can hope instead to see many more juicy fastballs over the next three months. And, so long as Edgardo Alfonzo's children continue to read him bed-time stories, and so long as Pedro Feliz concentrates on the whereabouts of the strike zone, not  his  children, the Giants will continue to score runs. That's great news for the regular season, against pitching that makes the mistakes the Giants have become so expert at punishing.  For its part, the outfield has performed slightly better than expected. Defensively, the team has not suffered the loss of Jose Cruz Jr., with Tucker guarding right field with aplomb. Dustan Mohr has spelled in both left and right, earning the respect of fans and team-mates alike with his knack of making gutsy grabs and slamming into walls.    In the meantime the ballclub has defied expectations, and regained the respect of the baseball community beyond the confines of the  Fox Sports Net  commentary booth. The areas of concern, as per usual, remain much the same: The starting rotation is more a revolving one-man show than a dependable quintet, quartet, or even a trio; the bullpen is as weak as it is white; the defense is shaky, but sturdy by yesterday's comparisons. The Giants have made 15 errors in their last 30 games, less than half as many as in their first 30 (31).   As the pitching staff aptly illustrates, Felipe Alou is seldom used to having options. So it must come as a welcome surprise that the infield--just four weeks ago comprised of Damon Minor, Neifi Perez, Ransom and Brian "Dilly" Dallimore--has evolved into a coherent, combatative unit.  Durham notwithstanding (pun intended: Don't hold your breath on that hamstring), San Francisco has gotten the most out of guys like Deivi Cruz, a refreshing surprise--and a doubles machine--at shortstop. Neifi Perez's glove, on the the other hand, always looks better when it comes flashing off the bench, not coupled with another 0-4 line. At first, Snow, Feliz and Minor present a multitude of possibilities, if not worthy occupants for the spot. Ditto third base, with Alfonzo playing at last like his $6.5m salary and Feliz, who's clearly most comfortable defensively when he's guarding the hot corner.     It is often said that it's better to be lucky than good. If recent results are anything to go by, the Giants could have the best of both worlds. For now at least, they find themselves in the driving seat in the NL West. If, as is expected, the outlook is unclear, we can at least be sure of one thing: Brian Sabean is glad he didn't trade for Richie Sexson in the off-season.

       The addition of a quality arm in the rotation would be worth more than a bat off the bench,&nbsp;or the&nbsp;plugging&nbsp;of the (Neifi shaped) hole&nbsp;at short.&nbsp;An innings-eater would take some&nbsp;strain off the&nbsp;bullpen,&nbsp;not to mention the rotation itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Speaking of which,  Brett Tomko  has arrived--albeit three months late. He had a good second half last year in St. Louis (8-3, 3.76 ERA), and has improved recently with the Giants, losing just&nbsp;twice&nbsp;since&nbsp;May 15. At this point,&nbsp;a&nbsp;strong series of&nbsp;performances&nbsp;could see his season turned around.&nbsp;  In 2004,  Edgardo Alfonzo  hit .295&nbsp;with 54 RBIs--4th most in the majors--in the second half.&nbsp;Over his eight-year career, he hits&nbsp;25 points higher&nbsp;during the&nbsp;summer months.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coupled with only moderate production&nbsp;from Monsieurs  Durham  and  Grissom ,&nbsp; it's a viable&nbsp;offense--even if it's&nbsp;without a No.5 hitter.  The bullpen will look different&nbsp;should  Matt Herges  regain his delicate touch in a set-up role, and should&nbsp; Felix Rodriguez &nbsp;be given a little less action and a little less responsibility. Help from the outside&nbsp;is probably beyond the efforts of Fresno, where the likes of Kevin Correia, Noah Lowry and David Aardsma could do with a few more girlfriends before big league contests.    Jason Christiansen &nbsp;should be&nbsp;shown the door in November. While pitching in the Arizona Fall League, he will retire after reaching the personal milestone of a first pitch strike. As for the other diminutive lefties,  Scott Eyre  might have the goods, but can he keep it together? Is  Wayne Franklin  a viable&nbsp;option, or just a career 5.50 ERA pitcher the Brewers didn't want?       Outlook   The streaky yet potent offense backs the renewed rotation. Tomko and Hermanson pool 15 wins, Rueter pulls 11 from his sleeve, and Jerome Williams holds back his critics with a lucky 13. Jason Schimdt, bullpen depending, crests 20 wins by the&nbsp;second week of September. All in all, it's enough for between 88-94 wins. That number depends on how quickly the questions in the bullpen are solved. There are, after all,&nbsp;only so many times a team can rebound from another 3-run blown save.&nbsp;A series of October baseball remains the best the Giants can hope for.

      With the July 31th trade deadline approaching, take a look at this  urlLink piece  from the off-season. Note that the players are much the same; this is the time that money talks.

      The Giant's form in the first half has been erratic. They have won twelve games in a row, and thrice lost four in row. They will go into the All-Star break either in first, or a stone's throw from it. Now the time has come to decide: Can the Giants fashion a realistic post-season charge, or should they steel themselves for an extensive off-season retooling?   Recent history points to danger. Only last July--although it may seem like aeons ago--the Giants made the biggest move at the trade deadline,  urlLink acquiring Sidney Ponson  to bolster the starting staff. This seasons' rotation has fared little better than last year, with Schmidt, Rueter and Williams performing at their 2003 levels, and Dustin Hermanson and Brett Tomko playing Jesse Foppert/Jim Brower and Damian Moss respectively.   The Giants pitching staff needs strengthening, from end to end. Assuming that the purse strings remain tight (the front office are not planning on adding payroll for 2005), the addition of a reliable starter is probably the most Giants fans can hope for. Ideally, a dominating partner for Schmidt would allow the team to contend in October. But without some restructuring in the bullpen, there be only more blown saves, not wins. Urgeuth Urbina is available--albeit at a premium--but there are a number of hard throwing options that Sabean and co will consider before any moves are made.   On the horizon, the changes could be ringing. Something at least to keep San Francisco's ailing fans entertained on that possible, distant road to Yankee Stadium.

       Chin Music , with  Jason Jurgens .    There have been some great walkers throughout history: Moses, leader of the exodus; Marco Polo, Italian traveller and latter day pin-up; John Muir, naturalist and explorer; and pretty much everyone pre-Henry Ford.   What about Barry Bonds?   This year, the venerable 240-pounder has strolled to first a total of 131 times in 325 plate appearances, or 40% of the time. Only two Major Leaguers, Lance Berkman and Bobby Abreu, have as many walks as Bonds does intentional ones, with 71. The top ten most walked players in Major League Baseball, excluding Bonds, have  urlLink 58 intentional walks  between them.    Over the course of his regular season career, baseball's proverbial "Man of the Millenium" has walked on 2201 occasions. With the distance between home and first base being 90 feet, this equates to 198,090 feet--or 37.26 miles--from bases on balls.  Not bad for a guy who barely chases down fly balls. Oh, and lets not forget all the times Bonds has walked to first after hitting a ground ball. Then there's 681 Home Run trots, at 360 feet apiece. All in all, that's at least 100 miles. Not bad, but all in a weeks work for Mr Muir--at, presumably, a fraction of the price.

        Giant's&nbsp;eye series win, October ball  &nbsp;  By  Neale Fenn    &nbsp;  &nbsp;  @   &nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;       It's&nbsp;not just the St. Louis logo that's flashy. Faster than you can say "NLDS", this team&nbsp;has the critics&nbsp;crying "post-season!". Playing in&nbsp;the division that's widely&nbsp;considered the most competitive -- if not the very best -- in baseball, the Cardinals entered play Friday with a ten game lead over the second placed Chicago Cubs.&nbsp;   Their cause is helped by&nbsp;having  urlLink Albert Pujols  in the line up, a&nbsp;man who has a&nbsp;legitimate shot at 700 career home runs. Only three players have in MLB history have hit 30 home&nbsp;runs in their first three years in the&nbsp;bigs.&nbsp;Pujols is one of them.&nbsp;This year, as of Friday, he already has 28. And anyone who doubts&nbsp;his ability should&nbsp;take a look at&nbsp;today's 434 feet tape-measure blast. Hard, even, to tell on which team was the  real  MVP.   Into this one-man mix throw future hall of famer Scott Rolen&nbsp;and his NL-leading 86 RBIs, Edgar Renteria and his 40 game hitting-streak,&nbsp;and&nbsp;veteran Tony Womack (hitting .296), you have&nbsp;quite an offense.&nbsp;Yet&nbsp;that's just the infield -- which also happens to be&nbsp;the finest defensive entourage in the land.&nbsp;Further afield,&nbsp;St. Louis&nbsp;can boast the talents of&nbsp;Jim "check this out"&nbsp;Edmonds and&nbsp;Reggie Sanders,&nbsp;who are virtual locks for&nbsp;35 and 25 homers, respectively. In short, this bunch  bangs .   Today, in the 84 degree Busch Stadium heat, the script was tossed as Dustin Hermanson no-hit the Cardinals through 6  1/3   innings. Giant's pitching coach, Dave Righetti, observed:    "He obviously threw very well. I'm sure he was fired up."    Probably the biggest understatement since&nbsp;rolling juke-box Matt Herges said that nineteen baserunners in 3 innings of work&nbsp; "probably wasn't going to win a lot&nbsp;of ball games." &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Hermanson, along with tomorrow's starter Brett Tomko, could hold the key to San Francisco's season. Ever determined, and&nbsp;lately consistent,&nbsp;these two&nbsp;have&nbsp;the chance to make&nbsp;Giants' rotation look at lot like&nbsp;St. Louis'.&nbsp;Even now, they're not as far off as people might think.   The Giants' rotation&nbsp;has a composite ERA of 4.19. They&nbsp;allow 1.34 base runners per inning, well above the league average of 1.25. The St. Louis' quintent, by contrast,&nbsp;are&nbsp;twenty-one&nbsp;cents cheaper than San Francisco at 1.13 RPI. Their combined ERA however, stands at 4.02.&nbsp;Not bad. Not particularly good, either. That's a distinction bourne out in a game like today's.&nbsp;Indeed, Cardinals' starters&nbsp;may have won&nbsp;11 more games (46) than their counterparts,&nbsp;but they have also lost&nbsp;one more (26). Hermanson meanwhile has laboured through&nbsp;ten no-decisions.&nbsp;He has three losses, as few as Jason Schimdt.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The point is either the&nbsp;both Cardinals' and the Giants' rotations&nbsp;are&nbsp;sound, or someone's been exaggerating. You can't have it both ways. But you  can  win with a good rotation. And you can lose&nbsp;with a good rotation, even a&nbsp;very good&nbsp;one (see&nbsp;Houston).&nbsp;   When the smoke clears, and the Bonds-Pujols golfing contest has abated, it's clearer why the Cardinals&nbsp;are 26 games over&nbsp;.500, and the Giants only 10.&nbsp;St. Louis&nbsp;has the edge in every department: hitting for average, hitting for power,&nbsp;defense, speed, experience, chemistry and indeed,&nbsp;the rotation --&nbsp;although the case for Morris, Williams, Carpenter, Suppan and Marquis may have been overstated. If the Giants are to prevail, they must look first to their starting five.&nbsp;With&nbsp;or without Kirk Rueter.&nbsp;   These guys&nbsp;have already  urlLink raised their game  once, (on May 1st the rotation sported an ERA of&nbsp;5.60) and now they will have to&nbsp;do it again. But even  if  they succeed, it may not be enough. For that hypothetical Cardinals'&nbsp;edge&nbsp;becomes&nbsp;the numerical&nbsp;chasm represented in the standings  only  when&nbsp;we look towards the quagmire that is the Giants' bullpen.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;where the story -- and&nbsp;it seems almost every other --&nbsp;ends.   Until then, kudos to Dustin Hermanson for a job well done, and to&nbsp;Tony La Russa, who decided&nbsp;to let Suppan pitch to Bonds in the seventh inning. After the game, he&nbsp;remarked:&nbsp;   "We should have walked him."&nbsp;    Kudos Mr. La Russa. The world needs straight shooters like you. So,&nbsp;indeed, do the&nbsp;Giants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      Special with  Max Knoblauch &nbsp;  &nbsp;  First thing's&nbsp;first: Playing in Denver is no excuse. From Colorado to the Cape Verde Islands, it doesn't matter where you are,&nbsp;a grooved fastball is gone. Just don't make a habit of it.   Meet Matt Herges, Giants "interim" closer, and bullpen buddy.  Interminable  closer, more like. In today's debacle at Coors Field he faced four batters, retired none, and&nbsp;gave up&nbsp;four earned runs. Later, he conceded:   "I didn't fool anybody."&nbsp;    That's a   pearl, make no mistake. Or rather, make plenty. The round-faced gladiator&nbsp;might have added, in the words of President Bush:&nbsp;     "Fool me&nbsp;once, I'm a fool who can't be fooled again."&nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;  So what's the deal? Why has Herges failed so miserably? Why does he look so startling&nbsp;like a LEGO-man? Clue number one: He's a nice guy, and nice guys don't make good closers. Second, he's a converted starter a la Shawn Chacon,&nbsp;not Eric Gagne. Third,&nbsp;and most importantly, he's mediocre.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Usually speaking in strict hyperbole, Herges is a man of few excuses. But that doesn't stop him from using them, ad nauseum. You start to think he not&nbsp;only expects to&nbsp;blow another save but, worse still, he actually  looks forward  to doing so. With&nbsp;Denver's latest addition to his glowing resume, Herges&nbsp;has&nbsp;surrended a ninth inning&nbsp;lead on seven occasions. Only Danny Graves has more blown saves--or BS--with eight. But he has a total of 36--65% more than the Giant's closer. The&nbsp;secret to Herges' (BS) success? Being full of it. And, of course,&nbsp;telepathy:&nbsp;  &nbsp;  "It was just one of those days where they owned me like they knew what was coming."    Admitting that you're someone else's bitch? Clue number four. At this point, we should probably stop counting--although you could instead try to add up the number of Herges' 1-2-3 innings in 2004.&nbsp;One, two,  three &nbsp;perhaps? (For those of you who really care, it's four).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  For the record,&nbsp;Matt (enough of "Herges")&nbsp;has retired 64% of hitters faced. In 43 oh-so-memorable innings, he has fashioned a delightful 5.86 ERA with 61 hits, 7 home runs, and 26 strikeouts. Opponents are slugging .520 against him. In short, no closer strikes outs as few, or allows as many hits, as&nbsp;does Herges.&nbsp;This is the way things have been. And this is the way things will be.  &nbsp;  Unless the management pull their collective fingers out of their collective arses, and get some help. Many teams far better than San Francisco have faltered down the stretch due a lack of&nbsp; an ironclad ninth-inning presence. Herges, alas, is more ironing board than clad. And he'd be the&nbsp;first to admit it.&nbsp;That's the thing about nice guys. Charlie Brown. This time at least, when&nbsp;Herges  inevitably  comes in last, the joke will be very much on us. He'll go full-time as a columnist with MLB.com. Then I'll go and pitch a no-hitter at Fresno.   The only thing worse than watching Herges, after all, is reading him.&nbsp;

      With  Neale Fenn     By shipping  urlLink Felix Rodriguez , the Giants have wrapped up their case for 2004. The arrival of perennial bench-warmer  Ricky Ledee  might have a few misguided fans nodding with approval (under the Pedro Feliz guise of  " 450 at-bats and he'll drive in 100 runs " ), but back in the real world, Brian Sabean has succeeded only in shedding payroll. The $3.15 million Rodriguez was due to earn in 2005 will now be set aside for an acquisition in the off-season, perhaps even that big bat to protect Bonds. At this deadline, the memory of last year's  Sidney Ponson  debacle was too fresh in Sabean's mind, while the chances of adding a decisive piece to the puzzle were as few as they were overpriced. In short, the Giants were too far behind. Let the Cubs and the Dodgers mortgage their futures instead.  Typically, San Francisco are not getting much bang for their buck. Ledee is a free agent at the end of the season. It should come as a relief then -- and indeed, is probably the  only  relief that's coming -- that Ledee, not being a particularly good player, is not a long-term piece of Sabean's plans. Otherwise, the Giants would have another case of A.J.-itus on their hands. Speaking of Pierzynski, and relief, that's where  Joe Nathan  rears his ugly mug. With a vengeance.  Sadly, the Giants' bullpen is no better without Rodriguez. His 53 appearances this season are sixth among NL relievers. Don't think that  Jim Brower  can handle the extra load. He's second in the list, with 57. Rodriguez has an ERA of 3.43, and a WHIP of 1.39. The other members of the bullpen sport a combined era of 5.50, and a WHIP of 1.65.  On being shown the door, Rodriguez had only  "Get out of my face, all of you"  to say to reporters. Ultimately, the durable right-hander may have failed to endear himself to the Giants' faithful with his 96mph fastball, 96 mph fastball repetoire, but  Jeffrey Hammonds  he most certainly is not. He rejoins  Tim Worrell  in Philadelphia to deepen a formidable bullpen, led by  Billy Wagner . The Phillies in fact could end up pipping the Giants for the wild-card. That would be retribution for Rodriguez.  All things considered however, narrowly missing the play-offs would be a good result for San Francisco. Even should Ledee hit .400 with 20 home runs in 100 at bats, the Giants will still finish only five games over .500. Sabean, for his part, played his limited cards very well. The Cards on the other hand (momentarily in town to display their prowess) have shown how a team  can  succeed with a payroll around $85 million: By taking chances, not Brett Tomko. On that note, the Dodgers added Brad Penny and Hee Sop Choi. They're  already  5 1/2   games ahead.    John Schlegel, ever the optimist, anticipated a different outcome:  "One way or the other, the Giants intend to get their two pressing needs met before the deadline. This was very likely the first step of two."     The "other step" was probably suposed to be Kris Benson; perhaps Victor Zambrano; even Penny. Sabean instead has opted, at last, for the long term. Adding an arm would not be enough. Losing one would not be enough. If indeed the Giants wish to address their shortcomings by  subtracting,  then all the rotation needs is losing  Kirk Rueter . Maybe that's what Mr. Schlegel had in mind.

        Top of the 7th vs. San Diego    D. Cruz ------ struck out swinging (3 pitches) D. Mohr ----- struck out swinging (6 pitches) N. Perez ----- struck out swinging (3 pitches)   There's work to be done by the bay -- beginning, perhaps, with a change in expectations. Calls of a new closer coming to town should be forgotten. It is time to close the door on the 2004 campaign.  The creases that need ironing in San Francisco are beyond the fabled mustering of Brian Sabean. On the back of their success against the worst teams in the majors, the ballclub has limped into contention. Against Colorado, Arinzona and Montreal, the Giants are 8-5, 9-4 and 2-0 respectively. The Giants' overall record of 56-48 is not only third in their division, but  sixth  in the league. Minus Jason Schmidt's starts, the team is 43-41. Even  in  Schmidt's starts there has been room for three bullpen-blown gems -- one each in May, June and July.  Inconsistency, no doubt, will be the Giants' epitaph this season. Tosh. They have played as well as the experts (including  you ) predicted. From the April outset, they have made mistakes in characteristic fashion. In 104 games, they have committed 64 errors, ninth best in the National League. The teams with tighter defense -- Los Angeles, Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Minnesota and Oakland -- tend to end up playing baseball in October.  Meanwhile, the Giants have hit into 102 double-plays. The league average is 80. They have stolen 29 bases. The league average is 50. And despite leading the National League in on-base percentage (.352) they have scored only the third most runs. 561 strikeouts might be the second fewest in the National League, but the Giants need to learn that it takes more than putting the ball in play to score runs. With a lack of selectivity at the plate, and flexibility on the basepaths, this offense will continue to sputter. The addition of a left-handed bat might do enough to convince us that the post-season is still a possibility. It's remote, but it has been done.

      When he turned 40 on July 24th, Barry Bonds had 683 home runs for his career. He is adrift of Hank Aaron's 755 by 72. Aaron, incidentally, hit 42 round-trippers after he turned 40. Carlton Fisk has the most home runs by a player older than 40, with, ho-hum, 72. A little extra incentive perhaps for Bonds to DH with the Angels through 2007.  Deivi Cruz leads the Giants with 19 doubles. His 189 at bats is also the fewest if you don't include the likes of Damon Minor and Todd Linden.  Since arriving in San Francisco in July 2001, the Giants are 66-21 in Jason Schmidt’s starts. His personal ledger of 50-18 is the best among Major League starters since then.

      SBC Park -- A game that a contending team needs to win. A contest that separates the wheat from the chaff. Cue the Cincinnati Reds and starting pitcher Juan Acevedo, with his tumultuous ERA of 6.74.  Yet the Giants fell, 8-7, despite overcoming a 4-0, and then 5-1, deficit. To boot, they failed to harness the momentum of Dustan Mohr's pinch-hit, inside-the-park home run -- the first at SBC.  Courtesy of his own balloon-like 9.24 ERA, rookie Josh Hancock got the win, the second in his career, and his second in two appearances for Cincinnati. Very much in character with the evenings' proceedings.  Beleaguered starting pitcher Brett Tomko's best move of the night was into the dugout. The consolation for his  gopher-balling madness is that without it, the gritsy Mohr would not have earned his place in Giants' history. Nor indeed could Adam Dunn have demonstrated so emphatically the virtues of power and plate patience. His 77 walks are just four fewer than the summation of A.J. Pierzynski (14), Marquis Grissom (21), Pedro Feliz (14), Neifi Perez (20) and Deivi Cruz (12). Dunn's 30th and 31st homer runs of the season were moon-shots: one over the 421 feet sign in right-center, the other a loping arch onto the gang-way in right. Scott Eyre was the ring-leader with a two-run, two out sixth and took the loss. Matt Herges, initially hoping to close out the seventh, continued instead to refine his customary single, obligatory triple, routine.  The Giants have now slipped in 61/2 games behind the Dodgers, after picking up a narrow 2-1 win over Pittsburgh. On the heels of Brad Penny's imposing debut yesterday (eclipsed by the feats of Noah Lowry), the Dodgers continue to ride on the strength of their rotation-- that is, NL relative strength -- and the engine that Adrian Beltre has added to the lineup. He has as many home runs (29) as Barry Bonds, 75 RBIs (7th in the NL), and is hitting at a .331 clip (4th in the NL). Despite losing Paul Lo Duca and Dave Roberts, the addition of Steve Finley means the Dodgers will continue to score runs. Penny gives this team a horse, with post-season success (2-0, 3.59 ERA). His potential could be described as Schmidt-like. The rest, be it 7th, 8th or 9th, will be up to Eric Gagne, who could suffer the loss of wing-man Guillermo Mota. Even should he falter, there are enough Dunns in the Giants' path, and indeed enough demons in their own midst, to curtail a trip to the post-season.  Nomar's coming to town. Again. Except this time he won't be back.
