      Up too late Every night Thinking, writing Keeping awake Getting ideas From being lonely From being happy From no emotion Wondering where It comes from My poetry My heart and my soul I see images Words inside Places and endings Beginnings and stanzas

      Disgusted by the sameness of your vices Infuriated by the lack of quality in your life My issues are a window to a pathway Your problems are excuses for your excess. So I'll save myself from you While being subject to your destructive ways. I will Create I will Think I will Feel And I will Be All the while wishing it were my hand Hovering over the Big Red Button.

      Wishing like hell I could find the fabled middle ground Dreams of compromise And fantasies of grey Peruse the cobwebbed corners of a mind I lost over a year ago. This paper reality and some remembered mistakes Continue to intrude on my ideas Killing them before they can escape Things to do, people to see, money to make- These things can't be done or seen or made If I'm off creating my own happiness.  Coffee and cigarettes and pictures For my words Or no words at all. I don't mind if I don't sleep But being aware doesn't make wishes come true.

      A rift hangs open in the Eastern sky Touching the boundaries of imagination And spirit Dimming the lights from buildings And holding free the pathway Between despair and elation  Have you seen yourself this night? Cradled in the hollow of a crescent moon? Comforted by the pre-winter splendor and Finality of imminent renewal?  Rejoice and mourn and awaken to dance again Your only audience eternity Your only truth held in the arc of light above you Expanding your boundaries of Imagination and Spirit

      Lose your watch And find the time To look for something else. Shattered little pieces Of a wholeness called a heart Soul-searching with wings For a flightless journey Into Yourself ANGEL The beauty dies and The death is interred In a Stone Coffin in a Niche in my brain To be examined when I Feel like exploring The thing once called Fear And I flip the hourglass Upside Down Starting over Like everything else

      Thought processes dampened All I can do is feel Nothing but sensation Makes sense anymore I'm feeding off my own emotion Slowly consuming myself As wave after wave of pleasure engulf me  A transformation begun at the time of my birth Reaching a peak, not ending, but beginning again With realization leading again to the culmination of My personal efforts to simply BE.  Becoming myself all over again for the first time Looking in the mirror and liking what I see But not enough to keep it Transcending physicality Into a world bewitched Where all there is left to learn is everything And Love is the only knowledge we need

      Believing in fate As time becomes meaningless Who would have thought That fairy tales are wishes? My dreams are made reality As the days blur together I am out of sequence I discovered something that was always there And tried to leave behind Something that will always be with me Forever Yours plows through the haze Outstanding as the moon in daylight Meaning is not Matter And my mind's infused with spirit I can feel warmth from the stars I am green with renewal I survive on instinct Because thought cannot be trusted And senses are but amusements For caged imagination I long for forever As I clear away the emptiness

      Breathe the water Drink the air Maybe tomorrow You will live Perhaps today You will die Time incomprehensive To our timeless minds Knowing nothing Knowledge of all I will write Not with a hand Listen and see The words in your head Hear my pen See my voice All the same Where I am A world unknown For all to see Open the eye Beneath the flesh

      Comin' outta someone else's head My thoughts are fake And my brain is dead Pourin' outta yours to mine Like a teapot full of dirt and grime  My fake thoughts are sluggish Like a fog in my mind Dull and distant, but there All ambition is rounded out Like the corner of a spoon Your thoughts for me, are bare  Comin' outta someone else's chest My heart is frozen And no feeling's left Just a bunch of replicated ice Black from dirt, but here Have a slice  My fake emotions leave much to want Some explosives wouldn't hurt (They are) Dull and distant, but there Inside my chest is a 2-D square All angles and no depth But I got lucky 'cause even this much is rare

      There is a hand-held icee pop Floating in my brain Can you feel the fear inside Keeping me alive? Numbness in my pinky finger Keeps me hot inside Warm enough to live Yet cold enough to die That chilly feeling in my breast The melting of my life Almost seems like little flames Burning in my toes My head is nice and toasty And my brain is frozen stiff The thoughts move freely through my mouth Though my tongue can't think a bit

      A nation once fit for a king Now broken and dull Like an old scratched Watch face Talk about time Taking a toll....  I woke up like poetry The hands, the hands, Grasping my mind Wringing words from it Dripping onto paper I saw the broken things The pictures The glass The watch And I thought "Close Enough" As I thought of my heart And the words look like blood Craving, which? Broken city, pollution Words Blood Time Heart I hear everything first Though not in my voice That person in me Dictating, singing The words in my head And all I could think of Was sharing this with you Because, unthinking but feeling, I woke up like poetry

      Too dark to sleep Too much light in here Sleeping with the light on Hiding from the man in the closet Shadowy figures Keep me awake Looming eyes, faceless enemies Taking my night, my life away Trying to sleep with the light on So very very tired of fighting, hiding My blankets protect me Pulled up to my ears Covering the sounds, the ringing The wind calling my name Falling asleep now With the lights on Please turn them off for me Mr. Man in the Closet

      Oceans of black with tiny white lights Blue petal shadows against a white center. Does nothing dare interrupt gorgeous nights? Just flesh filled with blood, warming the winter.  Hunger burns through my veins With a seldom-felt pain. I search through society's trash for my food. The deaths of the unwanted and forgotten my gain Sated, I wander to brighten my mood.  I happen upon a wondrous young lady She couldn't have been but a mere twenty-two. I beg her walk with me and she answers 'maybe' She was staring at the stars as I often do.  I ask for her name and she tells me 'in time' I say "that is all that I have, I can wait." A knowing smile; her pale face is sublime She says 'tomorrow night, make it a date.  I'll meet you here, at the hour of ten.' I smile and ask "but why not tonight?" 'I need time to make plans' and she smiles again. I nod to agree -  for with someone that lovely, I could never fight.  She stood and walked away toward the west "More time with the stars" I thought, "I do the same." She glanced back at me once, my heart felt its own theft My heart didn't mind, and my mind felt no shame.  The following eve' I fed around nine Not the usual feast, if I may be bold. The thief pulled a knife out, the murderous swine The next two were quick, I'd be prompt and not cold.  I arrived a bit early, ten minutes precise Saw her standing in shadow beneath the trees. I thought myself lucky to see her but twice And as I walked toward her, she dropped to her knees.  I stood calmly before her, then knelt down myself Looking deep into her eyes all the while. She opened her mind, and I entered with stealth She laid her soul bare; haphazardly, but with style.  I saw who she was, where she'd been, what she wanted She understood more than most dare comprehend. I said "if that's what it is, I'll give, I won't taunt" She nodded and cried with joy at the thought Of the beginning of her end.  I knew from the start we'd be lovely companions Sorrow fled when her I did sight. She filled in the holes where the others left canyons We set out to share one another and the night.

      Our delusioned minds are filtered through the debris left from our broken lives and ransacked by salvage crews in little white coats. As we fall into the pit of sorrow that we have been hopelessly dangling from since we can remember, I feel the Earth die around us and hear the screams of our souls trying to save ourselves from our own destruction. Then as night falls I see the moon and recall your face reflected in the water and your voice calling to me on the wind and I suddenly know the answers to all the questions I've asked for so long. As I'm wringing my clothes dry from my swim in your mind I can feel my body tingle from the warmth radiating from inside me from some place I've only now really discovered. The clouds above me cry out their torment and I dance beneath them happily and drink of their tears thirstily and wonder if I am the one who made this or if I am just thanking the person who did. And I myself cry out to the creator wishing it a happy birthday and asking if there are any more questions it needs answers to, because I now know everything. Beautiful, is it not? The sand falling, falling, and touching the bottom of the glass? Time. Time is just sand, and I have counted every grain and know now that I wasted my life watching time and not living in it.

      With thoughts like Pearls and Onyx I see Shadows And shades of grey you are blind to. We live in the same box. I think in X-Rays.

      I've died already, and gone to meet my maker. As I stare into the mirror I see its face. If it has one. 'She's back again', I thought to myself, as I wrote the words she says to my soul. 'A muse' I thought, as another had, so many miles ago. She pushes herself into pushing me, and in return I push myself harder. I watch the mirror out on the streets, seeing its every move amongst the fiends and the trees. A game where I learn, you learn, it learns, and we all come back for more even after seeing the brilliant morbidity and dull beauty in a blooming flower. We see our own mortality. Trying to feel deep as we watch the clock ticking and hear instead sand hit glass. The grass is green and brown and green again, and I wonder if I'm the same or if it's the same when it becomes itself again.

      Tired of hiding circuits I want to flip some switches And make everyone see the connection. Feeling a current Filling me with energies Not my own and welcome. You become a part of me Fill in the cracks and crevices Where I couldn't find where I'd lost myself. More powerful than fate Stronger than my personal demons. Touch. Feel. Smell. Taste. Listen And I'll tell you my fears. And they won't scare me anymore. Touch. Feel Me as a part of you. Me in this skin. Touch Your flesh to mine And find my light.

      Meaning has lost merit In the shadows of wire and metal As silicon replaces thought And silicone replaces tissue Graveyards have become junkyards As our respect for people has waned And  things  take their place of honor Evolution has become one path Instead of many As what we once toiled for is taken for granted And diversity has become just a word to comfort us.
