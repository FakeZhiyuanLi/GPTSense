       OK here's my contribution.....   The Three Texans   Three Texas surgeons were talking.... One of them said, "I'm the best    surgeon in Texas. A concert pianist lost 7 fingers in an accident, I    reattached them, and 8 months later he performed a private concert for    the Queen of England."   One of the others said. "That's nothing. A young man lost both arms and   legs in an automobile accident outside Houston, I reattached them, and 2 years  later he won a gold medal in field events in the Olympics."   The third surgeon said, "You guys are amateurs. Several years ago a  cowboy who was high on cocaine and alcohol rode a horse head-on   into a train traveling 80 miles an hour. All I had left to work with    was the horse's ass, a pile of horseshit and a cowboy hat.   Now he's president of the United States."    and on the other side......   This test only has one question, but it's a very important one.  Please don't answer it without giving it some very serious thought.  By giving an honest answer you will be able to test where you stand morally.  The test features an unlikely, completely fictional situation, where you will have to make a decision one way or the other.   Remember that your answer needs to be honest, yet spontaneous.  Please read slowly and consider each line - this is important for the test to work accurately.   YOUR TEST: You're in Florida . . . In Miami, to be exact. There is great chaos going on around you, caused by a hurricane and severe floods.  . . .   There are huge masses of water all over you. . . . You are a Newsweek photographer and you are in the middle of this great disaster. The situation is nearly hopeless.   You're trying to shoot very impressive photos. There are houses and people floating around you, disappearing into the water. Nature is showing all its destroying power and is ripping everything away with it.   You see a man in the water; he is fighting for his life, trying not to be taken away by the masses of water and mud. You move closer. Somehow the man looks familiar.   Suddenly you know who it is - it's John Kerry! At the same time you notice that the raging waters are about to take him away, forever.  You have two options. You can save him... Or, you can take the best photo of your life.  So you can save the life of John Kerry, or you can shoot a Pulitzer Prize winning photo --- a unique photo displaying the death of one of the country's most "powerful" men.   And so, here's the question... Please be honest...   Would you select color film, or rather go with the simplicity of classic black and white?     See..a little something for all of us.  I'm so not in everyone's league at this blog so, I'll resume the role as comic relief.  Like it or not I do have the right to post here.  giggle giggle.

      Man Kerry goes sking and locks up the democratic nomination and the news just stops. It's not like there isn't lots of ammunition. How about the guy Bush put in charge of making more jobs? Yep, the one that had just closed his U.S. factory and closed otu 75 jobs only to reopen in China with 180 jobs.  Dumbass much? I'm not understanding how we're supposed to believe the junk they throw out. I actually heard one of THEM saying that sending jobs overseas was akin to computers replacing typewriters.   COME ON. Have they never studied the logic of argument?   Computers replacing typewriters is a function of higher technology replacing older tech. Moving jobs overseas is about greedy, bloodsucking assholes that care only about themselves and the dollar over the worker. It's about saving 1/4 of one cent so that the stock price can creep up; something that only matters to the rich sons a bitches that own THOUSANDS of shares of stock.   Jobless recovery my achin ass.

        All we want are a few good men and women. Now, dammit.    So, what do you do when your military is dangerously overextended, with 63 percent of the Army's fighting force deployed in the "hot" zones of Iraq, Afghanistan, South Korea, and the Balkans? Oh, and not too many folks seem keen to join your armed forces since, you know, they aren't well treated and most personnel are looking at a stint in a hostile Middle East desert defending BushCo's oil interests?  Baby, you bring the draft.  Think it’s a joke – you know, like   urlLink Bush’s joshing earlier this week about looking for WMD?    (Bet   urlLink Lori Piestawa’s   two small children are going to howl with laughter when they’re old enough to understand.)   It's not.   Reports were recently circulated that a "special skills" draft was on the table specifically for people skilled in computers and foreign languages. The Selective Service countered the allegations with a statement on their website, stating that the Selective Service is merely fulfilling its role and hasn't ramped up in anticipation of a coming draft: "Selective Service is not getting ready to conduct a draft for the U.S. Armed Forces – either with a special skills or regular draft. Rather, the Agency remains prepared to manage a draft if and when the President and the Congress so direct. This responsibility has been ongoing since 1980 and is nothing new."  However, the Bush Administration's military goals cannot be met without forced conscription ....     Read more at  urlLink  "The coming draft'   ... and then tell me again why I shouldn't vote against Bush in November?   Speaking of November, the   urlLink Colorado Democratic Party   telephoned last night to ask for money. The guy went into his spiel about how things have gone to hell in a handbasket in the three years since Bush grabbed power and I interrupted to say, "Tell me about it. I was laid off in February 2002." The caller was like, "Well, being out of work I understand it might be hard for you to donate money but would you be willing to offer $10 to help get Bush out of the White House? Any little bit will help."  "Oh, yes," I said. Ten bucks is a lot of money to me these days but I'm more than happy to throw a token amount into the kitty if it'll help get Kerry -- an actual, you know, war hero and someone who understands that truly patriotic Americans  do  speak out against their government at times -- elected.

      So I heard a fun one today. A county in Oregon is no longer issuing marriage certificates at all. They were threatened by the state attorney general to NOT issue marriage licenses to gay couples because it conflicted with a state statute. The county clerk decided that because the state constitution forbids discrimination of any kind that the only logical thing to do then was to cease issuing the licenses at all. She claimed that when a state statute conflicts with the state constitution she just felt her hands were tied.   This is what comes of mixing religion with law. Referance places like Afganistan and Iran. One should simply NEVER let the dominate religion of a country or state run it's legal system. It will ALWAYS be inherently discriminatory. Simply by deciding to live by one code of moral conduct one must needs reject other perfectly respectable codes. This will simply never sit well with those who follow the other codes, and in a country founded on the principal of acceptance of differences it is simply unsupportable to limit the populace in this way.   Speaking of which, the death tax. Are yall aware that unless you have over $20,000,000.00 abolishing the death tax will not help you? So all of you $20,000,000.00 aires get together and try to convince yourselves of how screwed you are by the system. Take an economics class. There NEEDS to be a system of income reallocation in a system dependent on competition. The only folks that want the death tax abolished do things like own WalMart. Yes, the ones that use their vast income to employ folks at minimun wage, and work them too few hours per week to qualify for benefits. So I'm asking you........ should we reward the greedy bloodsuckers of society so that WE can come up with the trillion dollars over the next decade to replace what they save? Yes, 1,000,000,000,000.00 out of the pockets of the people who are deciding between medicine, and food, and a way to work so that they can continue struggling.  Yes, lets do reward the greedy millionaires.   People are SUCH dumbasses sometimes.

      Don't cha just LOVE the new book out from one of the Bushies employees? For years the word was that nothing ever leaked out of the whitehouse. It's kinda fun to see the assholes that used innuendo and outright lies to impeach the Clintons have to defend themselves against truth from within. And they say there is no justice in the world. OK, if there were real justice poor people would have health care, cars would run on hydrogen, every child would get a real education, and the current U.S. police state would turn back into the land of the free and the home of the brave instead of the land of reality TV and the home of the whopper. There being so many KINDS of whoppers around these days.   If you know what I mean.   Political Caucus training meeting tomorrow night that ought to be fun. I'm hoping that I get out without having volunteered to serve as a sacrificial lamb for a local office. Or maybe that happens the second Tuesday in April, I forget. Truth be told I'm hoping to run for office after I retire from the power company. I'm thinking county commissoner would be a good place to start my run for the eventual office of the president.    You heard it here first!

       urlLink Oppose the New Ashcroft Internet Snooping Request!     Attorney General John Ashcroft is asking the Federal Communications Commission for sweeping new authority to regulate the design of Internet communications services to make them easy to wiretap.  If implemented, this Ashcroft plan would dramatically increase the government’s surveillance power and risk making surveillance and privacy violations much more widespread.  It would force technology companies to build “backdoors” in their systems for wiretapping and thereby create weaknesses that hackers, thieves and rogue government agents could exploit to invade your privacy and conduct identity theft.   urlLink more....

      SO I heard a foreign government official on the radio today being interviewed. He said something that I thought was so obvious as to be funny. What did he say?  People are looking disfavorably on terrorism.  What the fuck? Like it's been such a popular thing in the past and just fell out of fashion? Sometimes the things leaders say just slay me.  At this point I bet Laura can put up lots of stupid things Georgy has said. But one does occur to me.  In a political stop he remarked that lots of high paying jobs are now being created. WHERE? How many? WHEN? Does he mean the jobs that his admistration can't ship overseas fast enough?  Which reminds me.   How stupid are we as a people? Highest standard of living in the free world and we can rush to make our fellow citizens poor fast enough? We all want the house and two cars and the nice TV and the cool computer. ...... But we go to WalMart to get 'em? That means that the manufacturer is making nearly nothing to make the thing and will soon be moving jobs overseas. It means that the people "helping" you make minimum wage, have NO benefits, and work maybe 20 hours a week. Hell, you're probably making up what you save in state taxes to pay for the benefits your "saving" is costing you. So again I'll say it.  How STUPID are we?

       Yep, have to agree with my blog partner. That was a really good article in the link below. Not a bad idea. Equality is about treating folks equally. Quit legislating morality. Quit using the legacy of the founding judeo christian perspective to rule a country made up of so many faiths that it staggers the mind. Believe in the tenents of the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights. Government is about regulating what needs to be regulated, and defending the country from abusive attack. United we stand, divided we fall. Give me liberty or give me death. One people, one country. I can't think of a better way to fight terrorism than to be a united people. Rather than have Texas policemen breaking into the houses of homosexuals to catch them having sex wouldn't those people have been better used by preventing the next Waco? Rather than battling the teaching of the theory of evolution wouldn't the money be better spent buying new text books? Rather than fighting planned parenthood wouldn't those resourses be better used in providing jobs so that the poor economy doesn't work to tear familes apart thru stress and desperation?  Don't be swayed by the pretty yet simple arguments.   It really IS all connected.  And YOU are an integral part.

      I've been invited to assist in Making a Point! I'm pretty excited about this! A place that is just about making a point and not about what I had for lunch today!  As Bill Maher says, it's an exciting time to live in. And I'm hoping that the Democrats manage to find their voice this election season. There is so much good to be done in the U.S. and since we've had the chimp for far too long it's time for someone that believes the U.S. should be on the world stage as a good partner and not the biggest bully on the block.   I'm right now so PUMPED that Salazar is running for the U.S. Senate for Colorado. I would love to see a crack in the republican armor of this far-too-conservative state. And I would love to see the deliberative body of the Senate back in the hands of the democrats. Hell, I'd like to see this country's representatives go back to believing in representative democracy based on majority rule with respect for minority rights and have us move away from representation of the most monied political contributors.   And I'd like to use less run on sentences.

      Having streamlined my  urlLink main blog  down to being only about the things I make, I find I am missing a platform for some of the other things in my life I feel passionate about, namely politics, religion and yep, you guessed it! Sex.  Ya see, I think it is down right irresponsible and poor citizenship to ignore politics-especially so one can "feel better".  I hear people  all the time  say things like, "I do not pay attention to politics" like they are getting their fingernails dirty (you will too!)or it's just so beneath them(It isn't I assure you). This just floors me. This kind of attitude is how we got the  urlLink Resident Evil   in office in the first place. Yikes! Evil of all kinds thrives on our not being willing to confront it. Wantto fight the good fight, leave the planet a little better than you found it?  Pay attention to your elected leaders. At the moment, they are undoing everything I think is good about our country. It doen't make me feel any better to ignore it. It just makes me, makes us,  apathetic, irresponsible and neglectful.

      Which brings me to the big ole flap over pictures of flag draped coffins being delivered to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. As an interesting aside my brother used to be an Air Force Loadmaster, he unloaded these same kind of coffins. My position?   LOOK at the pictures. These people gave their lives for something they believe in. I think it's a really wrong war wrought by the worst misadministration in the history of the United States. But I've been in the military, I know what kind of people are coming back in the coffins.  IF the man that sends them to their deaths can be man enough to go meet them when they come home the very least the rest of us can do is to look at the pictures.   Look. Everything they have is GONE. Their families are paying for it every day and the asshole who sent them to their deaths ships the family a freakin flag, a dead sack of guts, and a final check. Then he counts himself done with the whole messy process and goes on to kill someone elses child.   The least we can do is SEE them. At least once.

      Lately the pundits and comics have been pointing out the oddities of the Bush white house. Like the fact that the whilte hosue and it's minions are claiming the document that came out shortly before 9/11 was simply a historical document. They claem that there was nothing in it to indicate that there was an imminent threat. And they're right, noting in it, but they really shoulda read the TITLE. The thing in the big bold letters above everything else that said Osama Bin Laden intended to attack the U.S. That mighta been a CLUE. Or I suppose it would have been if he were in a country that had huge underground oil reserves.  And now I'm coming up short on ideas, I had plenty of examples when I started out. There's really no end of entertainment value from this bunch of yahoos. They spout the most insane crap and do it with a straight face and hope that the sincere tone will carry it thru for them. Like this whole attacking John Kerry about going to Vietnam and then protesting.   Look at it logically. His government drafted him. He didn't run, he served as REQUIRED. Something that Bush didn't do. Then when he came back he exercised his constitutionally bestowed right of free speech and protested what he thought was a wrong war. That is admirable behavior in my book. And at least if John Kerry sends troops into battle he will know what it is he's sending them into. He's been there.   There's just lots of stuff like that. They keep getting caught with their hand in the cookie jar and then acting like no one shoudl have the audacity to notice. It's really funny, or would be if it weren't so sad.

      I gotta agree with DyDy here. The mistakes just keep piling up for this bunch of hoodlums. And I don't find it at all hard to believe that Bushy can't think of a single mistake he's made. Folks that operate in his type circles just seem to think themselves above petty things like personal responsibility. It's funny, you'd think being president of the U.S. would mean that one would feel incredibly personally responsible. The last one that seemed to think so was James Earl Carter. I suppose Bill Clinton thought some things he did were mistakes.   Speaking of the Bill. I find it odd that the Bushites are trying to lay Sept 11th at his feet. Last I checked the Bush admisistration had been in charge for about 9 months before that happened. Also, if I recall correctly, Bill Clinton put out a kill order on Osama, that seems to indicate his admisistration DID take the threat seriously.   Oh well, it'll sure be interesting to see what happens next.

        The president needs our help.     "At (Tuesday night's) press conference, President Bush was asked if he could name his biggest mistake before or after 9/11. At first he said, "I'm sure something will pop into my head here." But in the end, he couldn't name a single mistake. Bush concluded: "I don't want to sound like I have made no mistakes. I'm confident I have. I just haven't - you just put me under the spot here, and maybe I'm not as quick on my feet as I should be in coming up with one." Help us help the President. This short list of clear national security mistakes made by the Administration popped into our head, and we'd like to know which of these you think is Bush's biggest:  "-- Invading Iraq without a plan for the aftermath.  -- Telling the American people that Iraq definitely possessed WMD.  -- Failing to send U.S. troops into Tora Bora to capture Osama bin Laden in November 2001.  -- Disparaging Army Gen. Eric K. Shinseki when he said more troops would be needed in Iraq.  -- Focusing on missile defense while ignoring repeated warnings of an imminent al Qaeda attack before 9/11."  Practice for November. Vote now  urlLink   here.

      Just for fun, let's look at the present U.S. holy war from some pagan perspective.   Connections with the earth are important. Blood and sacrifice are important. Honoring your god/s is/are important. So there are thousands of U.S. citizens on the sands in Iraq fighting and dying for their masters. Their masters serve the gods of greed and power. The blood seeping into the sands of Iraq feeds the power of those gods.   The locals are feeding the sands in like manner, blood sacrifices to their own gods. The power shifts according to who is willing to make the largest sacrifices.   How well the sacrifice works depends very much upon the intention of the offering. Suicide bombers? Well informed. The kid from Tennessee that joined the marines to escape a world of few choices and little future who is serving while believing the lie fed to him/her from the present gang of thugs in the white house? Not so well informed. Scattered energy gifts, not so well directed.   How do we win? We mix our religous metaphors.   We choose the Buddist method. We want a united, free, democratic Iraq. Well, presently, the Shities and the Sunnies are merging to fight the outsider americans. For just a moment look from outside the box. The unification of differing religous perspectives is a PLUS. They are uniting. Yes, soley to fight us, but unification it still is. USE THAT. Turn your enemies strength against him. Direct the distructive force so that it turns into the direction you wish it to go. This would include us being willing to look like we were getting beaten as long as it continued to serve our purpose. The way of the peaceful and all that crap.   Amazing what could be accomplished if we removed the ego driven, white anglo saxon christian philosophy from the equation. Of course it's much like asking the leopard to change it's spots, but then when the leopard is losing it's ass it behooves the leopard to try something different.

      Saw a bit of the interview with Condi Rice. I just knew what was gonna happen when she insisted upon telling the commission what it was there for in the very beginning. It personified the incredible arrogance of the present admisistration. There are many ways to interpret the proper use of power. The present gang of carpet baggers apparently believe the proper way to exercise the incredible power of the U.S. of A. is to go forward sure of themselves, asking for no help or advice from the rest of the world. Bulldoze the governments of anyone not in agreement with the new world order, install capitalistic systems where they do not exist, and lay waste to any and all that stand in the way of profit. They would appear to have decided that this end justified the mean they chose. That being bankrupting the U.S. government, alienating the entire rest of the world, and raping the rights of the citizens they are charged with serving.   Yes, all that I got from her opening statements. Some folks can garner nothing from an entire set of encyclopedias.   I believe one can understand the universe from reading a gum wrapper.   If you know what to look for.

      So the U.S. is now in a holy war. The Shities that were supposed to be our ace in the hole have apparently decided that they really do want a theocracy. Not a democracy. Ya know, we're the ones who think there is no other good government than the one of democracy. Arrogant isn't it? That system of thought that says what I think must be right. Arrogant, plain and simple.   So now, one day soon, the Iman of the Shites will tell his followers to rise up and throw out the damned infidels. That's what we are in the middle east you know. Infidels. Unclean. Unworthy. Thus easy to kill. The worthless just don't really count. So, since we've invaded their country and now occupy it they have infidels sitting in their holy world. If you have vermin in your home you exterminate them. Look for that to happen really soon.   You heard it here first.

      They're getting MUCH smarter.  Let me lay out this one for ya. The U.S. has basically conquered the world thru economics. We outspent the Russians until they went broke. Communisim didn't fail because it was a bad idea, it failed for the same reason the North won the civil war and the U.S. won WW one and two. The winner simply out produced the weapons and people it took to win. Economics.   SO now OPEC is raising oil prices which according to this mornings news on TV: every penny at the pump translates into one  BILLION dollars in lost spending on other stuff. Why would they do this?   To win economically. They KNOW we're gas whores. They KNOW we'll pay any price up to and including 3 bucks a gallon without changing our habits radically, it's been widely reported. So then what do you do in an election year when one of the guys who is running is prone to getting his gun off? You ruin the economy, raise the unemployment rate, and cause wide criticism of his policies which have led to the high prices. Because while we'll pay it, we complain each and every time the price goes up a penny.   They're learning. If we're gonna start taking over the countries that produce oil they have to, for their own survival, ruin us or fall prey to being our oil bitch.   What do ya think?

      Well, here we are,another military holiday in the land of the free. Funny isn't it? Two of the major holidays of the year are all about the soldiers? One for the living, one for the dead. Of course the 4th of July is really a celebration of the declaration of war. And thanksgiving is the beginning of a war of genocide. So I guess we celebrate lots more death and war than peace and love.   Somehow I wish it was the other way around.   Would it really be so bad to wage peace? To lead with love? To care for the weak, protect the minority, pour ourselves into a rising tide that raises all boats?  Worth a try I think.

      So lately I've been comparing the impact the dominant religion in this country has on the fact that we're waging war on the soil of a foreign land. And an often repeated thought out in the world is that the fact that many of Iraqs folks are muslim is somehow what makes it OK.   It's always good to look in the mirror. Tends to keep the hypocracy to a dull roar.  Last time I checked that big bible book it said things like: Turn the other cheek; Love your neighbor; Judge not lest you be judged; Thou shalt not kill. Stuff like that. And from reading I've seen that sometimes, as the book says, god decides it's time for lots of folks to die. God decides.   Since when did God tell anyone to invade Iraq and bomb wedding parties? George Bush keeps invoking gods name all over the place. But I'm not thinking that spending your childrens inheritance on depleted uranium ammunition really qualifies as ecumenical training that would qualify him to be the mouthpiece of the all mighty.   Heck at least god knows the names of the folks that die. And actually knows the names regardless of their place in the kingdom. Nice thought that, that god knows your name. Shoot, George won't even go look at the bodies of the men and women he's sacrificed in his holy war for oil.  I'm just left wondering, "Where's the outrage"? The guy trashes claims to be doing gods work by invading the muslim extremists lands, and no one calls him on it?  hurrumph.

      I am not Jerry.  Just got back from the State Democratic Convention. Went up yesterday after 3 and got the worst possible hotel room to stay in. Crys made out well, hers was on the side where the courtyard was but mine faced the scenic side of a big ole K-Mart. The bottom of my outside wall was plastic and let in all the light from the cars pulling up out front. One of the beds had a complimentary bottle cap on it. I had to unplug stuff to plug the TV in. The beds were lumpy, the colors were horrid and every jackass in the hotel had to keep calling my room all night looking for someone named Jerry.   OK, maybe it only happened 3 times but at least once the dude was drunk off his ass and wanted to argue that I really WAS Jerry. Now you do understand that you have to convince the drunk that you're NOT Jerry in this case or the A Hole will keep calling back. I finally succeeded. At least until 5:30 AM when he had sobered up and forgot that he'd called at 2:30 AM also.   Ah well. I was an alternate but ended up getting to vote on everything that came up on Saturday! (Today that is) so I got to vote for Dennis Kucinnich like I wanted. And I voted for Ken Salazar for the senate race, but only because I'd promised I would. I've now decided that I'll work on the campaign of Mike Miles. He was simply fantastic. And spoke to all the issues I care about.   It was sure fun, even though I ended up in big rooms full of people all crowded together. Talk about nervous sweat. Goodness but that bath is gonna feel good tonight.   So now there's to be a run off election between Mike Miles and Ken Salazar, Mike got 51% of the vote when he was hoping for around 30. It was really fun to watch.   Oh and Ann Richards spoke there as well. She's wonderful. Told stories, and made jokes and touched hearts. It's a lot more interesting if you hear the whole thing rather than the bits and pieces you see on TV. If they show those at all. Wonderful woman.  We'll just have to see what happens next.

      OK so mostly I talk about politics. Usually not about religion and so far never about sex. Anyone really want to hear me talk about sex? I thought not. :)  Politics? I'm going to the state democratic convention this weekend for a bit. I'm an alternate, and who knows but I might well end up being a delagate and if good fortune shines I might even get a berth to the national. Sure it's pie in the sky but I LOVE pie in the sky. Always tastes better with a bit more atmosphere on it if you ask me.   Then it'll be home for more YARD WORK. The bright spot is, of course, seeing my Lowa. The other bright spot? I'll get to take my shiny new ebay truck to Pueblo and back! Yes, lovely, fabulous downtown Pueblo. What the hell is that about anyhow? WHY do they hold ANYTHING in Pueblo? Sure, sure I know they have a wonderful selling point. ....... Just look at all the empty hotel rooms! Perfect for a convention! Maybe that's it. It doesn't really explain why the state fair is held there, but I guess it's a start.   Why do I think Pueblo isn't a world famous destination spot? Let me count the ways......  It's dirty and it stinks  It's too hot in summer and too cold in winter  The mall is a sad poor excuse for a shopping experience  No Best Buy  It's too far to be close and just close enough that it seems like a good idea to go there instead of Denver for shopping  On the weekend you can count on running into people you know from the valley, there is NO escaping these damned inbreeders.  And lastly? It just FEELS depressed and depressing. Like a pall is hanging over it.  Other political news? I got some unplanned advertizing for the union election I'm in. If I win it means I go to Denver once a month for meetings. Not bad really.   OK, now it's time to talk about sex!  See, I just KNEW you didn't wanna hear about that.

      Laura just forwarded me an article about the torture going on in Iraq.  I've been meaning to comment on this but now I'm compelled. I'll quickly restate that I was in the military from 1978 to 1982. I was in the peacetime Air Force. I didn't have to kill anyone, but I did interact with tons of folks that did. I learned lots about how war works, how the military works, and how indoctrination, brainwashing, and intimidation are commonplace and acceptable methods of the top down management system employed by the folks trained to kill other folks before they can be killed themselves.  George Bush was AWOL during Vietnam. He joined the service in which he KNEW he wouldn't be called on to serve his country. It was the cowards way out of the conflict. Brave men and women went to Vietnam or fled to Canada, they did not pretend to serve.   But I digress. War is hell, you can ask anyone that's been in one. All the rules and regulations go out the window when the shooting starts. You don't train an innocent 18 year old to take the lives of their fellow humans and then get them to make the fine distinction of when to stop. You don't tell them they're fighting satan himself and then make them believe they should play nice with the devil when he appears to be under their control. You don't send people into real combat, who then watch their comrades die, and manage to convince them that they should treat the killers they've been fighting in a humane fashion simply because the murderous devils are now disarmed.   So the kids over in Iraq tortured, raped and maimed the Iraqis under their control.   AND YOU ARE SURPRISED? Can you smell the denial? I knew this would happen. It ALWAYS happens. It is war. In Vietnam they would take prisoners up in the helicopters and ask the first handy one a question. Before he had the chance to answer they'd pitch is ass out the door to die screaming as he hit the dirt. The next one to be interrogated would start answering the second he was picked out of the bunch. And there were things done that were much worse. But then if you stuck your head in the sand and pretended to serve your country then you could avoid seeing the real effects of putting the children of this nation in harms way for the good of Haliburton.  This is my point. Bush doesn't know SHIT about going to war. He's a modern American. He knows how to blow up the hardware with high tech weapons and lazer guided projectiles. What he doesn't know is what it costs. And I'm not talking about the dollars and cents he didn't provide in the first place. I'm talking about lost innocense. I'm talking about teaching children to kill. I'm talking about him sending my fellow countrymen and women to die for oil (because if you still think this war is about terrorism you're not only uninformed, you're just plain stupid). The man is EVIL.  You want to see evil? Take a look at the poser in the office of the president. He says shit like "Bring 'em on" to terrorists and then sends them your children on a platter. He sends your children to die without flak vests, without supplies like proper food, and without thinking about the true costs of doing so. He hid out from war in the Guard and then sends them over for longer than ANYONE was forced to serve in Vietnam. Fucking Hypocrite. He's a fucking hypocrite. An evil fucking hypocrite.   They talk about reinstituting the draft? It'll never come from the rethuglicans. Because then the true cost of war comes home. It's no longer mostly poor people with no choices serving along side the occasional wealthy patriot. Now it's everyone, on every block that can die. Now, sticking a flag on your car isn't enough to be a patriot. It's cheap patriotism that is, no cost. Now, if there's a draft, you might actually have to die for what you beleive in.   Bring it on.

      About 25 years too fucking late if you ask me. Ronald Reagan is dead. I won't miss him. The man that lead the conservative revolution, drove us to the brink of bankruptcy and brought us Iran-Contra. As one of my co workers said today?   "I hated the fucker. I wouldn't piss up his ass if his guts were on fire"  I know some colorful people and thank goodness that they aren't the kind of phonies that pretend to like you when you're dead if they didn't like you when you were alive.   I watched Reagan work what he called supply side economics. It was really spend-yourself-out-of-a-depression economics. Cut taxes and run giant deficits to spend your way out and let the future generations pay for it. I think that must be where the chimp got it.  He was evil, nothing should be named after him, and he should be buried face down because he always wanted the world to bend over and kiss his ass.  We're not the kings of the world. We're people. Just plain people lucky enough to have been born into a pretty free country. I was reminded of this listening to NPR today. Someone was complaining about Iraq and the new government to be installed there. Their point was the role of women. That they should be equal. OK, time for some common sense.  THIS country didn't have equaility for over a hundred years for women and 200 years for African Americans AFTER we won the war of INDEPENDANCE. But all of a sudden the country we INVADED should come out of the cultural dark ages in a couple of years? Are they that much more advanced than we are? I say that because we don't have equality YET. Women don't get paid the same as men (unless they're union and that is a socialist organization anyway). People of color don't get the same treatment and opportunities as white men. You cross the street to avoid confrontation with teen age black kids, don't you? Well don't you? You know that you, yourself, practice the self same acts that tell the other people on the planet that they're not part of YOUR world and aren't as good as YOU are all the time. And if you don't think so then you either aren't paying attention or you're really good at lying to yourself so that you can preserve the air of entitlement about your place in life being what it is because you're SO smart, SO good, SO kind, SO deserving, SO the member of the right religion, SO well bred, SO well mannere. SO FULL OF SHIT.  Wow, that went somewhere I didn't plan on.  Where was I?   OH yeah. Give Iraq some time. IF they want to change they'll do so. Yep, prodding is good, showing is good, examples are good. No not the kind where we torture them in prisions, but the other kind.  Patience. The thing we need to practice is patience. That sure self knowledge that I didn't get where I am over night and I shouldn't expect it of you.   Try it, for just a day.

      Had our first meeting of the upper level of the San Luis Valley regional coordinators for Mike Miles for Senate. See the longer your title the more important you are. We laid out some preliminary plans and geared up for when we get the info we're waiting for to make the contacts we need to make to hopefully get Mikes name in the forefront of folks minds as the August 10 primary draws close.  It was kinda funny though. As we were making plans at the local DQ things just kept falling for other folks to do. Crys is in charge of Data and the administration and prioritizing of how it flows and what flows from it. Bennie is in charge of keeping the democratic party honest during the primary. She's also gonna get us some applications for local fests and fairs. Of course at one point they looked at me and asked, "What are YOU going to do"?   Dang, no slipping under the wire with those two!   I do have jobs. I've been emailing to get info and stuff sent down. I'm starting to contact folks in some of the counties to get volunteers for each county to do the same things we're doing but at a more micro level.   So interesting to read Derbs last post. Sure does make me curious
