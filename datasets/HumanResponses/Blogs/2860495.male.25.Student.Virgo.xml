      Happy day.  Special thank you to the excellent people at the Robert La Follette School of Public Affairs for granting me access to their fine institution.   Maybe I'll be in Madison come August.  The offer has been extended.  They've asked.  Now it's the hard part. LBJ, Kansas, I'm waiting.

      Sometimes, he frustrates me, but then he comes out talking about education policy and talking about how they need to present their policy alternatives and he gives you (me) goosebumps.  He talks about the people who are ignored by the system.  He's just good.  Good, good, good.  Dennis Kucinich says some good things every once in a while, but he also sounds like a broken record.  The debate is fun.

      I wish that he would support more health care spending.  I know that he wants to work to reduce poverty and he wants to spend money that could go towards health care on increasing the wealth and savings of the working class.  That is an extremely important issue.  The wealth disparity is probably the single biggest cause of problems for our working poor.  However, if you spend money on health care, you would reduce the negative effects of poverty on the poor.  The reduction of the negative effects also has an equalizing effect as there is less doubt as well as a reduced burdon from health care expenses.  I see no reason why we can't have universal savings programs as well as health care.  Also, I understand that Edwards was raised in a mill village and saw jobs go away.  I also understand that Kerry is the richest of the US Senators.  And finally, I understand that in the realm of trade, there is no difference between the two of them.  In this case, background doesn't matter much.  Edwards may have been poor, but he's a multi-millionaire now.

      Thank you to the University of Kansas Department of Public Administration.  I appreciate the reason to buy a suit.  I am fortunate enough to begin the next step in the graduate school application process by interviewing with a fine alumnus from Kansas.  It'll be good fun to be sure.  Texas, Wisconsin, you guys are on the clock.

      So, if Robert Reich is my hero, and he is, and he's supporting John Kerry, which he seems to be doing, does that mean I shouldn't be as apprehensive about this surge in Kerry momentum?  Kerry is fine and good.  He's certainly better than Bush.  He just lacks passion and energy.  He doesn't have the presence.  John Edwards has that.  He also has a message that seems to be in line with my personal philosophy.  Whoever gets the nomination has a responsibility to say address some issues that my former Governor Clinton never quite sufficiently tackled.  I'm still waiting for increased funding for public transportation and job training.  I'd also like to see some legislation requiring the broadening of advertising job postings.  Companies are more comfortable and more confident with the workers that they can find in the suburbs so they don't bother advertising job openings in newspapers that primarily serve the lower SES inner city.  Give me public transportation and better access to jobs, and I'll give as much money and time as I need to help get you elected.  Also, I am not interested in emails telling me how to get sex with older women.  I don't know what list I'm on, but I'd like to get off of it.

      Can you think of anything more egotistical than me, some punk ass of whom you have never heard, endorsing someone in the quest for the Democratic Nomination in our upcoming Presidential election?  Neither can I.  John R. Edwards.

      I don't mean to imply that I am some all-knowing sage in the world of American Politics.  I'm not.  I'm just some kid in my mid-20's who's getiing married in a couple of months... Okay, I'm some young adult just hoping to get into graduate school so that I can try to help some people who otherwise wouldn't get the attention that they deserve.  What I am having trouble understanding, is where is the consistency of thought in those who are making the major policy decisions in our nation.  We decide that welfare is bad, so we get rid of that.  We push most of those people into minimum wage jobs, but we refuse to raise the minimum wage such that these people are better off working for themselves.  We don't offer any significant job training programs.  What little we have, we scrap so that some people who owe their wealth and success, in no small degree, to the system can get a tax cut and opt out of the system that they used to their own personal advantage.  How are we helping our workers prepare for the reality of a global economy.  We eliminate their jobs.  We send them to the lowest bidder.  This wouldn't be such a bad thing if we would possibly increase training to those without so that we would have workers skilled enough to work the higher paying technician jobs and higher skilled manufacturing jobs that remain.  I don't know is all that I'm trying to say.  Good times.

      So, it would appear that by the end of the summer, I will be living in sunny Madison, Wisconsin.  I hope that I can learn to reduce poverty and do good things.  That would be nice.

      I love their music and they seem to be nice people, but they're poops.  Stupid poops.  I ask some people to play my wedding and they tell me that they probably will.  This process repeats for months with me asking them when they'll have an idea of their schedule and then I check their website and they have one confirmed show after April and that is on my June 5 wedding day.  Did they notify me?  Hell no.  I still like them, but I'm a touch pissed off.  I'll go see them if they come and play.  I'll hopefully get over it soon.

      I just want to say that, Hidalgo County, you are in good hands with Lloyd Doggett.  He's done a good job representing Austin and the County of Travis.  It's just an unfortunate thing that two incredibly different parts of the state have been lumped together into a Congressional District that will be nearly impossible to represent.  These areas have such different needs.  It's a shame.

      Q: (Egyptian President) Hosni Mubarak is saying the new U.S. policy on the West Bank could escalate violence. How do you respond to his concerns?  BUSH: Yes, I think this is a fantastic opportunity. You know, the fact that (Israeli Prime Minister) Ariel Sharon said, We're going to withdraw from territory, is a historic moment. And it creates a chance for the world to come together to help develop a Palestinian state based upon a solid foundation, a foundation where the institutions are bigger than the people, just like our respective governments are founded.  It's a chance to provide a framework for international aid that will help a Palestinian economy grow. It's a chance for people to come together to work on measures that will enable people to live in peace, security measures.  This is a historic moment. And I think people need to view it as such and seize the moment and help a Palestinian state become a reality, a Palestinian state that can live in peace with its neighbors.  And, you know, there's a lot of talk about the final status discussions and that's all in good. The problem is that people, by doing so, don't pay attention to the moment. And it's a moment we've got to seize.  The final status discussions will become a lot plainer - and by the way, we're not going to prejudge the final status discussions. But the answer's become a lot plainer once there's a peaceful state that's committed to fighting off terror and a state that's capable of providing hope for its people.  I think it's possible. And the prime minister and I have spent a lot of time in this subject, and I'm not going to put words in his mouth, but he thinks it's possible. And we look forward to working together to make it possible.  But it's going to require a commitment by the Palestinian people to find leadership that is committed to peace and hope. And it's going to require a commitment by people in the neighborhood to support the emergence of a state.  This is a historic moment. I appreciate the prime minister of Israel coming here to announce it. We intend to seize the moment and to take advantage of an opportunity.

      So, in case I haven't beaten this one to death.  I am now officially going to attend the Robert Lafollette School of Public Affairs at the University of Wisconsin.  I will be a masters candidate starting in September.  If I weren't getting married in June, I could honestly say that I've never been more excited about anything in my life.  As it stands, I'm really excited.  Finding the perfect companion for myself would tend to trump anything else that could happen and will forever stand as the most exciting thing to ever happen in my life.  So, if anybody reads this and lives in Madison, please inform me of any good grocery stores or movie theatres.  I need this info.

      What the hell kind of person is so scared, so insecure, and so ignorant as to think that allowing same sex couples the right to marry is going to destroy the institution of marriage?  I'm going to love and cherish my wife as long as I live whether homosexuals get married or not.  I don't understand why the Republican Party thinks that it needs to deny rights to a small portion of the population, especially a group that is already being treated poorly.  Love is a good thing.  A state recognizing love for some, yet not for others is vulgar and offensive.

      How is it, that someone can start to get homesick three weeks before moving away from the place that they consider to be home?  I'm going to go ahead and blame the writing of thank you notes to very dear friends whom I don't see enough of as it is.  It's kind of tough, but nobody ever told me that it'd be otherwise.

      I'm fed up with these stupid Dean supporters who act so put out about having to support John Kerry.  Get over it people.  Most of you fancy yourselves to be so progressive and liberal, yet Dean was, after Lieberman, the most conservative of the potential nominees.  We've ended up with a healthy moderate to liberal ticket which includes a rising star with great appeal in John Edwards.  It just wears me out to hear these Dean people whine.

                "There meet in Jesus Christ, infinite justice and infinite grace. As Christ is a divine person, He is infinitely holy and just; hating sin, and disposed to execute condign punishment for sin. He is the infinitely just Judge of the world and will not at all acquit the wicked, or by any means clear the guilty. Though His justice be so strict with respect to all sin, yet He has grace sufficient for every sinner, and even the chief of sinners."  Excerpt from "The Excellency of Christ" preached at Northampton, 1738  Jonathan Edwards

      Okay, if you've ever read this blog, which I know you have, because I am the only reader, then you, I, know how much I love John Edwards.  I find a great deal of common ground with him on the issues.  Like him, I am basically a moderate southerner who cares very deeply for the poor and underrepresented.  Some people dismiss Edwards has a faux progressive, but he's the only politician in recent memory to take center stage and have the courage to talk about poverty.  He's a brave man and he deserves support.  That said, Kerry didn't have to pick Edwards to have my support.  I'm young and am leaning towards activisim of the Democratic variety.  Kerry had my vote regardless.  The pick of Edwards says that he cares about keeping people like myself involved and I respect that.  I will now be passionately advocating for the Kerry/Edwards ticket hoping, in part, that it leads to 8 years of an Edwards presidency following Kerry's 8 years.

      I know that some people really love punch and pie, but for me, nothing is better than tea and toast.  It tastes so good.  Buttermilk toast with strawberry preserves and Yorkshire Gold tea make for a nice afternoon snack.  Plus, I feel nearly classy drinking tea and reading in the corner.  Granted, I'm only killing time whilest waiting to go to work to make the sandwiches, but whatever.  It ends soon.  It'll be different to not do the same job that I've done for the past 4 plus years, but it'll be a very nice change.  By the way, The Roaring Nineties is a great book.  It's great for at least the first fifty pages anyway.  That's as far as I've managed to get.

      So, there's no doubt that I'm going to vote for John Kerry.  I'm going to be very fortunate to do that voting in Wisconsin, a swing state, as opposed to Texas, W country.  I think that Kerry is best man for the job that is still running.  I'm liberal, so that shouldn't surprise anybody.  While I don't disagree with Bush on many things, I don't think that he is evil.  I don't think that he's all that bright or skilled either.  In my opinion, he's trying to do what he thinks is best for America and the world and none of the negative consequences of his actions ever even occur to him.  I miss the days of reasonable people disagreeing about the proper course of action and that not only being okay, but being the preferred way.  They point of politics would seem to be to get groups with a common goal yet different views on how to achieve said goal.  In this arrangement there would be dialogue and a give and take.  That doesn't seem to happen.  While we, the people, seem to seek some common ground, our representatives seem to seek out opportunities to thwart the democratic process.  (Again, while I like to think of Bush as not evil, I'm very tempted to throw that label at Tom Delay).  I, like many people, went to see the new Michael Moore movie this past weekend.  Sure, it is an effective piece of propaganda, but it seems to be another example of accusing a group of being evil because they disagree with you.  Maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe the left needs someone like Moore so that we get motivated to act.  Maybe he is supposed to serve much the same purpose as Rush Limbaugh does for the right.  I don't know.  I never found Limbaugh to be terribly helpful for the state of things.  Anyway, I'm torn.  I find Moore's books entertaining and at least in my little world, he's nothing more than a rabble rouser who's not to be taken entirely seriously.  I find myself distressed when people afford him the same respect and reverance that they afford to legitamate thinkers and political leaders.  If W is a fake man of the people, then what of the millionaire Moore.  What's more of the multimillionaire fraud that is Ralph Nader.  I don't want to talk about Ralph Nader though, because for all of his ego, Moore seems to care much more about the collective good than Nader ever could.  I don't know.

      So, today I look at the New York Times editorial page and what do I see?  Barbara Ehrenreich staring back at me.  So she's going to be replacing Thom Friedman for a few months on the op-ed page.  I prefer to see her as the liberal beacon as opposed to Krugman, who seems to be more about Krugman than about anything else.  Everyone should have read nickel and Dimed.  And, although Beth Shulman and not Barbara Ehrenreich wrote it, Betrayal of Work should have also been read.  Powell's or Amazon or even the wise folks at Bookpeople, where my wife works, should be smart enough to bundle these books together.  They go brilliantly together.  Poverty and the working poor is a problem that should concern everyone.  It is very clear that the typical American, with our willingness to shop at Wal-Mart, Target and the like, is not doing enough to help low wage workers.  These stores don't keep the prices low by getting some super secret deals from distributors that aren't available to your local merchants.  They take it out on the wage earners.  They treat their employees as disposable tools.  It's not right or good.  It doesn't help society.  If this is how we keep prices down, maybe the prices need to come up, not because of inflation though.  The government needs to get involved, raise wages, legislate profit sharing.  I'm convinced that wages could go up and prices could stay low if there were some mechanism legislating the distribution of profits between manager and worker.  It makes sense.  All arguments for keeping the minimum wage low is that increases in wages lead to increased unemployment.  That's true, but aren't  executives compensated?  Don't their monies count as wages as well?  Wouldn't an increase in their wages lead to increased unemployment?  If that's the case, then skyrocketing executive pay should be considered a problem for the public good meriting government intervention.  I don't mean to imply that managers and executives don't deserve to be well compensated.  Surely they deserve compensation for their expertise, experience and education.  But, not hundreds of times that of the typical employee.  That's just silly.  That will conclude my partially completed thought.  The first such post in months.

      So, I've just moved and regained access to the oh so precious internet.  This is what I have to say about moving across country.  Madison is nice.  One problem, I live down the street from a barbecue place.  Strangely enough, they have a picture of Ruby's in the men's room.  Anyway, every night, close to dinner time, the aroma of smoked meats and barbecue sauce enters my home.  I've wanted barbecue chicken every night that we've been here.  It's too much.  Beyond the smells, it's nice.  I seem to have settled on the fringe of the hispanic part of town, which is nice.  I've already found good mexican food and palettas.  It's nice.

      PBR is a serviceable alternative to Lone Star.  That is my conclusion.  It's not as good, but it'll do.  The Capital Amber and Capital Brown are both better than Shiner.  I will miss Zeigenbock.  There is a store here called Woodman's.  It houses more beer than I have ever seen in one place in my life.  It's kind of like a little slice of heaven.  I'm going to struggle to get used to the liquor in the grocery store thing.  That's different than both Fayetteville and Austin.  Be strong.
