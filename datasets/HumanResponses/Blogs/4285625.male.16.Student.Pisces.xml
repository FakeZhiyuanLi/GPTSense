      Yeah didn't do much -looks behind him- yeah, lets see felt weird in English since I got suspended from that class.  GRRRR -charges up- oh andrea is making me mad she dissed on my DBZ which I dont care about because its a gay show I just wear some of the shirts.  Um yeah Amanda and Joey look good together, but one thing JOey is mine A MAN DUH!!!!.  Yeah havn't talk to Frankee she probably wont even look at me -laughs- yeah dont care I'm not a dramitical person and I dont push ppl to do things they dont want to do.   lets see wat did I do I sat in my hosue Bj came over and he left me and richard came back from wallmart.  Um I thought about becca lol, then I was like hmm so I got in my car drove to pick up Jerry *tight kid Lj's lil bro* then I went to the field show thing which looked kind of um "gay".  Saw Summer didn't care thou saw john didn't care...me and jerry chilled with some girls and Will, we then the girls started righting the bull dog which got me very happy and then they all started walking on the roof of the school (dumb freshmen)...yeah I gave summer a letter since she wrote me one and yeah I guess I'm suppose to right one back riight.  Yeah then went to Lj's house chilled with him, andrea, and jerry then andrea a.k.a ajax left then me and lj talked about some stuff.  we talked about why I wont ask summer out, about wat I'm going to do after high school, wat am I going to do this year, wat are my plans, ppl, sex before marriage which I tink your a fool if you wait until marriage to have sex if you like the person and I dont mean like u have to have strong feelings for that person...so its almost like u are on the line of love, but it may not be love yet since u may be confused then do it I say....dont tell ryan or Bj they are gay christian ppl so am I, but some rules are ment to be broken...                                                                             Well that is all Boo just for You

      Yeah went to see Exorcise the beginning yeah I saw Summer in the movie she was the ugly whore climbing on the wall hahahahahaha lol jp jp.  about the ugly whore climbing on the wall actually she was pretty hott when lucifer took complete control of the girls body and she started saying dumb shit.  But, yeah I chilled at Troy's for 3 days and yeah I havn't seen my mom yet so she hasn't talked to me about being suspended yet, my dad is pretty cool about the whole thing.  Yeah I need to get my act together right now me and matt just got back in and Richard came over and now we are watching Arnold on Tv.  Yeah Arnold is such a fag, yeah exorcise is a good movie but some fags were sitting behind me and kicking my seat and Troy and Stefen were about to snap on them.  Oh Pooh yeah we saw him and his hood of his car flew off while he was driving and yeah started crackin up at that shit.  He's hella dumb it probably happens to him every day he should put tape on it or something to hold that piece of crap together.  Yeah I wish I can be cloned that would be (looks behind him sees himself) interesting....(looks next to him and sees himself and looks back and sees more of himself)....hmmm I knew I forgot something
