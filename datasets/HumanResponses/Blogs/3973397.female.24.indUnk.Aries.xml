      i have never thought of this as a resort for me in my relationships, i just don't think i could take the missing part that well. however, last night my bf told me that he had gotten so angry at me at our recent fights that he had considered it. he never did but he thought of it. that was a sting to the heart! in my opinion, if you had promised so much to your partner as much as we both had with each other, then you have to find a way to solve the problem and stick to it. i told him that if he had gone through with cooling off with me that day then by now he wouldn't be able to contact me anymoer 'coz i'm pretty sure that i would cut the communication due to heartache and disappointment. he said that he would worry so much that he would be forced to come over and find out what happened to me.   but that is over now, we are back to our usual happy and "in love" state. everytime that he and i have a fight, we seem to connect even more... there is this sense of openness that we get to have with each other when this happens. we get to appreciate the presence of the other in times of trouble. more so when the trouble is brewed by us! little things that usually would escalate into big arguments, jealousy mainly. but lo and behold, we always end up soothing eah other's pain and finding solace in each other's love. ain't love just grand?! ♥ÜÜÜ♥  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

       get enough of the time that me and my bf text the other night. It came to a point that i got a bit jealous of his time he gets to interact with his barkadas... stupid me, huh!? anyway, nagtampo me... as a result of that i didn't reply to his text messages, thinking, "let him feel how it is to want to text and not be able to".&nbsp; I know it seems childish, i'm not denying that it's not, but that was how i felt. I am a very emotional person, easily carried away by my thoughts and emotions. i hate it! i wan't him beside me, i want him near me always, i don't want to have him far away from me where i can't touch him. silly long distance relationship!

       I am so happy now, last night my bf told me that he may be coming here next week to buy something for their business. Looking forward to spending more time with him again. I truly missed him&nbsp; and his ways with me. Hopefully, he could stay much longer so that we could enjoy having a talk and just going around town. Never mind that he is here to do business, he promised and is excited to be with me that day. Sigh** Maynta ugma naa na! hehehe&nbsp;

       I just feel so empty today, my bf and I hadn't texted much last night coz of lack of budget for load and him getting a flu. Got soaked yesterday from the rain, he and I, but only him got sick. I missed him coz we often text at evenings... and he wasn't there last night. Not only that, problems at home are still persistent. I just want to put everything away and have a happy day for once. But a part of me also wants to just face all of this and have it over&nbsp;with! I&nbsp;pray every chance i get&nbsp;that God would give&nbsp;me strength to pull myself together.&nbsp;As they say, "this too, shall pass." Hopefully, for me , soon.&nbsp;

        After some mind-splitting and heart-breaking thinking about the issue between me and my bf i had finally decided that we should go on with our relationship. As said, Love is a choice, so i chose him.&nbsp;Besides, he is not with her anymore and the baby is not even with him. The stupid girl took the baby with her on a "vacation" and never returned unless he would agree to marrying her! Blackest of the blackest fucking blackmail!!! Good thing he didn't give in, huh?! Ü He and I wouldn't be here now if it did. Whew! And so, here we both go again with our long distance relationship, ironic that the most serious relationship i ever have is this.. I don't know, people may say and I even have said before that long distance relationships are a waste of time and it never works, but it somehow is on the process of working out for me. Only time will tell if it'll ever end up the way that we hoped that it would.     &nbsp;   I am not the most trusting person on this planet, after having been taken advantage of in the past. It was partly my fault because I allowed those things to happen inspite of the constant excuse of being naive and all. A person can only be naive once in life, the rest after that is failure of judgement? hmmm... (Feeling wise?!!) hehehehe&nbsp; Nah! just thinking out loud, as usual. But then the bottomline for me is&nbsp;to at least not fall into situations that I can't get myself out of. There!

      Life can be very unfair at times, i love my bf and he feels the same way about me. There's just one minor problem, i could not seem to get over the fact that he has a baby with another girl from a previous relationship with someone who he said he does not have feelings for. Gosh! old news for most men, in my opinion. I don't really care that much about the woman or the baby but it just feels like that woman had taken away my joy of having my bf's first baby. I know that to other people this sounds preposterous, but hey! that's what i'm feeling right now. A lot of people have problems with their relationships and they are all understandable, i don't know if mine is logical to other people looking in. It certainly is real for me.

      broke up with my bf for a day coz he called me and my friends bad names, he apologized for it and said that he was even shocked at himself when he pressed "send". his sister's been telling bad things about the group, told my bf that what could be her reason for telling him that? if she had thought of us that way even before then how come she goes with us, she even partakes of that "libak" thing going on in the group!!! now, doesn't that strike you a bit odd that she just told my bf that when she herself is having problems with her family? she told my bf that she can't take being "plastic", that just made me so angry. if only she'd know now that i would not force my presence on her or anyone else! when she returns to work, i will not even acknowledge her, let's see how she takes her own medicine!  as you can see, i'm just so angry at her. right now, i'm still blinded by that. and i don't care what she does any more.
