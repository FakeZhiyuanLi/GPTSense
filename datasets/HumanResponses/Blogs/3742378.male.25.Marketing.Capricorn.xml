         Apparently there is a website that specializes in local, slower lower apparel, which I thought I would share with all three of my current readers:   urlLink Slower Lower Delaware.com   Pretty interesting stuff if you ask me.  If you were at all curious about why I'm trying to get out of this dump, this should answer your question.  Also, who knew, but the  urlLink Washington Post  did a big report on Slower Lower Delaware...ain't that grand?  Now who wants some slippery dumplings?  (pronounced, sliprie, dumpin's)

         Clapton is god...of guitar at least...  I don't think another man could have done it.  Clapton's prized Stratocaster 'Blackie' has become the most expensive guitar ever sold at auction, fetching $959,500 at Christies in New York.  That is an accomplishment to say the least.  I would love it if I became so famous that something I touched could be sold for so much mulah.  Maybe my boxer shorts from when I lost my virginity would go for a whopping $450,000, who knows.  Clapton's guitar however is priceless...If I owned it I would idolize it in a vacuum chamber for millenia to come.  It could start a new religion...Claptonanity.  On a plaque next to the guitar I would tell the story of the divine birth of Clapton through the virgin mother "Layla."  And it went a lil' something like this:  One day when the almighty guitar god saw "Layla's" "tears in heaven" and  said, don't cry baby doll, that's no need to do 'Cocaine.'" He sealed the deal when he said, "come to my 'White room...with black curtains.'" So "Layla" did, and the almighty guitar god "shot the sheriff," until the break of dawn and created Clapton, the son of the almighty Guitar God.  Some may say that Stevie Ray was the greatest, or maybe Hendrix, but I think everyone of them has the utmost respect for Clapton.  He's not the greatest most talented musician in the world, but he has his uber-genious qualities about him.  I remember when I was 14 or so, Clapton did his MTV's Unplugged album and it was the first time I had heard him.  Listening to the track "Old Love"  I was almost inspired to become a great blues artist.  Sitting in a smokey lounge everynight of the week, my guitar as my best friend, singing about mad women, bad money, veneral diseases, or illegitimate children.  That's what the blues is about anyway isn't it?  And for some reason , even if you have none of those conditions, you can still love the blues.  If you haven't heard "Old Love" before, or maybe not recently, go grab a copy, pop that in, sit back, and let me know if you think to yourself..."this would be the coolest thing in the world if I were a Blues Man with a veneral disease."  Cause I think undoubtedly it would be...  I've been running everynight, for one reason and one reason only.  I don't want to get fat as I get old.  Sure, I may not be a chunk of meat pie right now, but I believe it is on its way.  So 5K a night with my two boys Jake and Wellwood has proven that we too can be men of stamina, endurance, and great willpower.  We've been running at Killen's Pond which is a slowerlower mecca for cross country runners.  If you ever make it down this way, I highly recommend checking out the course.  I digress...after Jake, Wellwood, and I run each day, we say "good run guys" and slap eachother on the ass like Montana and Rice did back in the eighties.  We've decided we're going to make T-Shirts, FMRC (Fat Men Running Club)  were the motto is, "5K a day, makes the chickies stay."  I think it has  a certain ring to it.  Yet, I think  urlLink tonypierce  said it best when he said, and I'm paraphrasing horribly, "we don't work out so that we can look better, we work out so we can f*ck better."  I believe that probably is the case in the end.    4th of July weekend is coming up, My lady is coming back into town from her Master's of Accounting studies, so if anybody is looking for two people that are willing to party this weekend, look for the overstressed accounting student, and the dental sales guy sipping on bud lights at Northbeach...  party on...wayne, party on garth.

      Since it is morning on Friday, most of you are finishing up your last day of work for the week, or waking up from Thursday night and getting ready to do it all again tonight.  What am I doing?  Screwing with these  urlLink damn laser lights    http://www.matthearn.com  started it all off when he linked me to his  urlLink freerangehuman website , now for whatever reason I'm completely addicted to this damn Laser Light game!  I've made it up to Level 19 all by myself, the password to get there is "ccd."  If you beat it, please post a walk through in the comments of this post and end my insanity.  In other slowerlower news some of you may be asking, what do we do in slowerlower for the weekends?  We aren't too far from Philly, or NYC, or DC for that matter...So do we hop in our cars and head to more populated areas to search out lost souls and found beer?  Not at all...we bring the city to us.   urlLink Dewey Beach  is not just a 2 mile strip of sand and debauchery (think new orleans, but on da' beach mon), it is a way of life.  Go there to find out what's going on this weekend.  Friday night, you may be able to find me at the Rudder, Saturday afternoon at The Cork, and Sunday at Northbeach.  If I'm not there, i'm studying for these pisser tests they make you take before gettting enrolled in  urlLink grad school .  Which is a whole 'nother story for a different day.  As I uttered a line by the great Tom Cruise "This is Maverick and Goose requesting permission for fly-by"...I passed a woman on the way to work today with a license plate frame that said, "My Car Stereo plays MANILOW only."  So if you pass her on the side of the road today, please don't help her, she deserved it...muhahahahaha  Even though no one has read this blog yet, I highly recommend using  http://www.buzznet.com  to post your pics...it's hot.

      What does someone, who has never considered himself a writer...write about...when he decides to start writing?  Maybe I should vent about something crazy going on with the world as you can see at www.instapundit.com.  I could write about my daily rigamorand like at www.matthearn.com...Instead I just got a phone call from one of my friends that I've had for a long time, and she gave me enough material to write about for the entire life of this blog, whether it be one more day, or one more century.  A little background: -I have been friends with the girl since the 8th grade, since I don't care if anyone knows how old I am, unlike www.tonypierce.com, I'll tell you I'm the ripe old age of 25 going on 18. -She and I have never EVER had anything romantic, and the thought of doing anything with my pinky, and her stinky, disgust me. -She tends to attempt to live as if she were a member of Sex in the City, except without the wealth, just the sex and a lot of it -This would be healthy, if she didn't try to overcome her lack of emotional attachment by fucking every man with a wanker and a nice smile...  -So she ran off and did just that on Tuesday night, yay good for her, rinse and repeat, it will happen again next week.  This time, she's emotionally attatched....rinse and rinse and rinse and rinse again, and the shit just won't come out.. Now she's all upset and whiney and overanalyzing because this guy is hanging out with a friend and didn't call her...get a grip on yourself woman!    -You see I am extremely lucky right now.  I have found a woman, who truly loves me for me, respects me, is intellectually stimulating, will make me laugh, will let me cry, and we are together as one.  Our minds have seriously melded, so forgive me if I see my friends little rant tonight as petty.    We are in our mid-twenties people, we are grown up, I thought we could leave this type of behavior at the prom...get over him, if it's meant to be he'll call you, if not, he'll fuck this other chick.  In the end...why does it matter, you're just going to rinse and repeat anyway...    urlLink Colin's

         &nbsp;  So since I last posted, a lot has happened...So today, I am going to list out wonderful things that have happened since the last posting:  &nbsp;  1) I ordered two of the  urlLink Airport Express  wireless base stations for my computadora.&nbsp; Por Que? you may ask if you are of spanish speaking decent.&nbsp; This way I can do three things:  1: I can expand my wireless networkness of my house up to about 5 miles...so I can now be wi-fi on a jog.&nbsp; You can never be too connected.  B:&nbsp; I can wirelessly stream my iTunes music to my living room and to my bedroom speakers, I like having less wires.&nbsp; I also like that with the Airport Express, I can have less wires and more party...very Hefner isn't it?  III:&nbsp;I can&nbsp;hide everything for my speakers and printer behind my desk.&nbsp; This way I don't have to plug in a bajillion wires when I come back from my wi-fi jog...  &nbsp;  2)&nbsp;I have began studying Urdu, and I'm so excited about learning a completely different language and alphabet.&nbsp; For those of you that aren't as secularly knowledgeable as myself (did I just make that word up?), Urdu is the language of Pakistan.&nbsp; It's very beautiful and wonderful and it makes me think of things like birds singing in trees.&nbsp; I like it because one day I will be able to talk to Henna's grandmother about things and she'll be like, "Yo, this kid is pretty cool, even if he is a whitey."&nbsp; I'm still learning how to translate "Yo" in Urdu...updates will follow.  &nbsp;  3)&nbsp;GMAT Studying is crazy!&nbsp; I found out the charge for the exam is $225 bucks.&nbsp; Unlike when I took my SAT's and it was my father's hard earned money, this money is actually coming out of my pocket.&nbsp; $225 can buy a lot of things, 12.5 cases of Bud Light, 18 years of Playboy subcriptions, 1 cold air intake for my car so I too can be a yo boy, 400 rolls of toilet paper, 1 night in a hot hotel somewhere in DC, a cool bling bling necklace, but instead, I'm spending it on my education...I must ace this test the first time, if anyone has any advice to help out, please spread the love, like butter on my educational bread.  &nbsp;  4)&nbsp;I went with Henna and the  urlLink E&amp;Y  crew to  urlLink Busch Gardens  for the weekend.&nbsp; A quick rant...how come I95 between DC and Richmond is jam packed on a friday afternoon at 2 o'clock?&nbsp; Where is everyone going?&nbsp; My only guess could be that there was one hell of a bake sale going on somewhere, or maybe a sweet chickin' and dumplins' at some fire company.&nbsp; The road was backed up forever, and added an hour to my normal 4 hour commute to CVille.&nbsp;  Regardless the trip was amazingly great.&nbsp; We stood in absolutely no lines for any ride, and sufficiently made ourselves giddy with motion sickness-ness by riding the two most hardcore coasters there two times in a row before lunch time.&nbsp; (that would be four times for our accountants out there).  A great moment in sports history was watching Ginelle and Jose on their first ever coaster rides.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apollo's Chariot&nbsp;has something like a 3 mile drop.&nbsp; I swear, I could not breath about halfway down the hill, and almost blacked out 4 times before I hit the bottom.&nbsp; Needless to say, not a good coaster for your first time.&nbsp;&nbsp;I achieved gleeful happiness&nbsp;was&nbsp;when Ginelle was crying after her first ride of "Apollos Chariot."&nbsp; Jose, never cried (because he's a man, and he's "the hammer"), but he did scream with girlish delight, and swore that he would ride any coaster that dare cross his path.&nbsp; After 5 more rides on the "Chariot" and that would make 15 miles of free fall according my calculations, Jose never vomited, never cried, and never grimaced in the face of fear.&nbsp; He's my idol.  Ginelle and Jose both went on all four roller coasters that day.&nbsp; Making their first times last much longer than mine (you all are pervs...but I set you up). &nbsp; 5) I went to a wedding of a&nbsp;friend I've known for a long time.&nbsp; Pictures can be seen over on the&nbsp;right, or ask me to send you the link to&nbsp;my snapfish album.&nbsp; It was absolutely wonderful, and made me all sappy inside.&nbsp; Highlights included the chocolate fountain, which I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;be pulled out of, did I mention open bar?&nbsp; Also, I caught the garter, invitations to my own wedding will follow.&nbsp; Lisa looked beautiful and my $5 - $1 Dance was money well spent.&nbsp; Mark was handsome and made sure my $5 dance was money well spent.&nbsp; Seeing all my highschool friends together and happy made me weepy...All in all a great wedding. Upcoming events:  -This week, Laurie our representative from the west coast is in town for the week.&nbsp; She'll be staying with her family and partying with us.&nbsp; I might try to kidnap her and take her to Kristen and Richie OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO tonight at the lighthouse in Dewey.  &nbsp;  -Henna and I are making a weekend date to Washington DC this weekend!&nbsp; We have tons planned and I will not reveal them all until after the weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;But I can reveal a few:  ...We are staying at the very botique-ey  urlLink Rouge Hotel   ...We will be seeing The Producers on Saturday night at  urlLink The Kennedy Center .  ...We will be eating at undisclosed locations on both Saturday and Sunday  ...The rest of our activities will be of the romantic nature that will make you all puke, I can't wait to tell you all in person and clean my shoes.  &nbsp;  I need a link of the day, so here you go:   urlLink You need more bling?   &nbsp;  All distances and other numerical values were extremely exaggerated in today's posting, thank you to the letters A and J and the number 5 for making special appearances.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      Funny stuff from the guys at  urlLink zug.com   Read on and prepare to tinkel in your doity:  Yesterday I complained about my local Walgreen's drugstore, and my observation that everyone, up to and including the store manager, seems either mentally retarded, mentally challenged, or just mental. This is not a criticism, just a statement of fact. It has bewildering consequences, such as another recent experience I had in the Walgreen's checkout line.  This time the checkout line was being run by a short, squat woman with thick spectacles and an overbite. I suspected she was in her mid-30's, though she had that strange ageless quality of the mentally handicapped. I was buying some Wal-tussin (cheaper than Robitussin, but still lets you "pour a little 'Tussin on it"), and as I approached the counter, she was angrily finishing up a phone conversation. She slammed down the receiver and turned to me. "Guy says I charged him for a Coke. Says he didn't buy a Coke here, says he doesn't even drink Coke. I was like, 'So bring it back, you retard!'" All this she said with a profound fury, as she grabbed my 'Tussin and angrily scanned it three or four times.  You know, you grow so used to the sullen "Hi" or "Hello" offered by convenience store workers, that you forget that they have other options of greeting you, such as yelling. I was struck by her calling the customer a "retard," since I suspected that she was also retarded. Maybe retarded people have a hierarchy? I mean, when a retard calls you a retard, then you know you're retarded.  Next she turned her attention to a plastic bag in front of her. "Where is that woman?" she demanded angrily of me.  "I'm sorry," I said, wanting to savor every moment of the transaction, "which woman?"  She didn't answer, but looked frantically out the front door. "Shit!" she exclaimed. "Where is she?"  "Where is who?" I asked.  "That'll be $11.97," she said, still looking out the front door, absentmindedly clutching the plastic bag. "She had three kids, they got into a minivan. She's probably gone already. Shit, shit."  "I think you scanned my 'Tussin a few times," I ventured cautiously.  "What?" she hollered. "Shit," she concluded, then proceeded to void out the transaction, a process which took roughly the time it takes to write a dictionary. All the while, she kept looking anxiously out the front window, waiting for the mysterious woman to return.  She finally scanned my 'Tussin at the correct price, and I handed over my money. "I'll bag this myself," I said. "I can see you're busy."  "If you see that woman out in the parking lot..." she said, then stopped, gazing out the front door.  "Yes?" I asked.  The customer standing in line behind me moved up to the counter, and I moved to the side, patiently waiting for my clerk to finish her sentence.  "The woman?" I prodded her.  "...tell her she forgot her bag," she finally finished.  Somehow I'm wondering if the woman just fled. I'm telling you, this Walgreen's is friggin' creepy.   John Hargrave, the King of Dot-Comedy, is a world-renowned author, performer, and lumberjack.

      So, I have had at least two people come up to me and ask why I haven't been posting...so that means I have to update....here is a reason why I haven't been posting... 1) I was in Louisville, KY for 3 days of business last week. No computer in hotel room...boo 2) I've been in Charlottesville, VA every weekend for the past four weeks... 3) I'm a lazy slack ass and prefer sleep to typing every night. So here's a quick update...just to keep you posted on my whereabouts in case you would like to stalk me with binoculars and sketchy phone calls. After the weekend adventure with the YMP'ers at Busch Gardens (they should trim and be called "Racing Stripe Gardens" don't you think?) - A weekend trip to Washington DC with Henna Henna...(she's the only woman that can be called by her first name twice and make it sound cool) (also I love parenthetical asides) on this weekend trip we had the most fantastic dinner ever at  urlLink The Capital Grille . After the meal we saw The Producers at The Kennedy Center, which was the most hilarious show I've seen in a while...props to the gay dude who could make you laugh with a simple hand gesture (no you pervs...not that one) -Another weekend trip to Charlottesville, where I found at that US 29 was my most favorite and most hated road all in one weekend. The trip down that usually takes 3.5 hours took 6 hours. For all those reading this, I probably already told you about this experience in one way or another...like the telegraph. So I apologize for bitching about VADOT's ineptness.-I won a promotion at work and was able to purchase three things which are cool cool cool: A Study Guide for the DAT's, I’ll update you on that later A new pair of work our shorts from Adidas with one of those cool liners so I can freeball it. Two new DVDs which will make me spludge all over their musical wonderness... The Led Zeppelin 2-Disc DVD set that includes much never before seen footage. The Simon and Farfunkel Concert from Central Park. I'm all over Mrs. Robinson like ham on cheese. And I know there is more, but I can't think of it right now, and my phone is ringing... That was Justin, he has news about the upcoming trip to Hershey, PA...exciting I know...hold your pee...cause you're leaking with joy. SOOO...I will give you some more favorite sites of mine to browse since mine is updated slower than my brother's...  urlLink Fark is Great, you should know that by now...   urlLink Engadget for all you geeks out there   urlLink Dave Barry makes me wee, and he has great games   urlLink Games for being productive at work  I will have more later....I swear ;-) CONGRATULATIONS YMP CLASS OF 2004...you all rock my world...
