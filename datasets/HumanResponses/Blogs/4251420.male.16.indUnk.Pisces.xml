        This has been the most eventful year of my life. i think it is safe to say that. a lot has happened.i have stepped out of my comfort zone oh so many times and ignored the lump of fear in my chest. lets see wut i did this yr to make me more outgoing and risk taking...lets only include the uh note worthy stuff shall we?     ~ i actually AUDITIONED for Concept after not making it in grade 9 and made it not only to Jazz 1 but to Jazz 2 and tap woot.     ~ i went for ABCD student council for assemblies and made a complete fool of myself by saying TEACHED in my interview adn bursting out laughing after realizing that the word is TAUGHT.but wut is life without laughter?      ~ i dropped dance which i have done since the age of like 4 to do somin so different and challenging: rowing!i learned so much about team work and hard work and omg i do not regret one thing about that     ~ i went to my FIRST job interview all ALONE with my dad 40 min away and my mom 2 hrs away and i BIKED there i mean how much guts does that take?     ~ i am about to start a new skool yr at a totally different skool in a city i dont no and with ppl i dont no. away from everything ordinary. its weird cuz i wished for this to happen way back near christmas.to have a different life.any one but my own.and i have that.and all i want is my old bed back with my mom there tucking me in and all my stuffed animals around me and my puppy. be careful wut u wish for.          Let s see...what are the most important things i have learned this past yr?      ~The right thing to do is most likely going to be the hardest thing you have to do.and you can never to it alone.you need guidance and strength and unconditional love from Jesus Christ and our Amazing God.     ~ Never take your friends for granted.even if they are the greatest friends, at some point they have to let you wander astray so you will know you need them and all they do for you.     ~ No matter how much you want to be different, striving for it and making dumb decisions based on it defeats the purpose and you turn into something you are not and following morals (or lack thereof) you do not live by. never be somethig you are not     ~ have fun dont think too much     ~be confident     ~no matter how hard you try to save your friends from getting pushed in the water, the boys from rowing out number the girls and you will get pushed in whether or not u choose to kick bite and flail around. and just when u think ur safe and u tried ur best to save laura, dave WILL push you in and logan will point and laugh     *ok so that was not generalized but it is a very important thing to remember*
