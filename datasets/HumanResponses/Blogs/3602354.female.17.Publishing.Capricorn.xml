      All my fears related to the little boy are gone, but not precisely in the way i wanted them to go. Its really simples to explain the fact but not the feelings which came along: He dumped me... just like that. He said he didn't want the commitment of having a girlfriend, he didn't want to do all which that implies, it means: call me everyday, be with me the whole day... and all that stuff. But it is nonsense, why? Easy: BECAUSE I'M NOT LIKE THAT!!! I don't ask all of that, because i hate that kind of dependence. But he just imagine he had to do all of that, and got sick of it, although, like i said, i wasn't going to ask him all of that. Of course i would like him to call me, but if he doesn't and i really wanted to talk to him i would call him. Also with the "being together all the time" thing, i didn't ask him, that and neither was i going to. Anyway, he made his decision, so there's nothing else i can do, but mourn and weep a bit and keep on with everything else. Definitely i'll take a big break with love. At the end i always get hurted, if not because of me, because of somebody else, but always hurted. I'm not going to stand it anymore, i don't have to. I know i always say so and never keep the promise, but this time i will, for my own sake. I want to this break to last at least until i go away from here, then it will start another story of my life. I hate love, i really do... but i have to bear it all the time, because of my stupidity. Too bad for me, but i'll fight against it... or at least i'll try.

      Maybe now you don't know i'm talking about you, but as long as you find out you're the only who knows this page, you may realize that this has precisely written for you. (Too many "you's" in that paragraph jaja)  Anyway, let's get to the point. You may think i'm also blind (like you) because until today i didn't realize you had posted two comments, well it was only one but it said there were two, one deleted and one there jaja. Well the matter is that i just saw it today and it really hit me, not in a badly way but in a weird one. When i started reading what you wrote (after the first paragraph, the one with the explanation) i got this feeling, a nice but weird feeling. I really liked you telling me your thoughts about what i had written, it was great to get a friend's opinion, and even greater coming from you, one of my best friends (if not the best of all jeje). So all this is to thank you for writing to me, and telling me what you think and feel about what i think and feel.. And thank you for the comment about buying all my books jaja the first one may come out in a few months, so get your wallet ready jaja. Well, that was all i wanted to say to you: THANK YOU SO MUCH!! See you later... soon i hope.  PS: by the way, you still have something to tell me, remember!

      Finally, i'm with the one i wanted, but there's a bit of a problem... i haven't told anyone, and i'm afraid to. But i don't even know why (like with all my other fears), maybe cause i think it's too much early after the other guy, and also maybe cause i'm may be criticized by hanging out with a 13(almost 14)-year-old boy... i know that in many ways he's still a child, but i really like him, i have a very good time with him... anyway i'm still afraid. The other thing that frightens the hell out of me, is that we are already boyfriend-girlfriend, so i just don't want to hesitate no more, because that end up being the reason of breaking, and i don't want it to be this soon. I really want to last at least a couple of months with him... IT'S ALL I'M ASKING!! I have to trust myself and see what happens. Damn it just seem so difficult, and that's why i'm scared... i don't want to end soon with him, i really like him... (i have already said it twice, it must be something.. no, it may not) I wish i just had someone i could talk about it without repressing my emotions or anything... i even had to lie to one of my best friends!!! Just because i was afraid of telling her the truth about him, that i like him and that we are already together. Anyway, now i'm WITH him, so i have to enjoy it without worrying about it.. looks hard but i'll make it!.... hope so.

      Sometimes i see my life like through a glass to give me the chance to appreciate all the things this fucking life has given to me.. and i can see that i have too much to live for, i guess. Any way, sometimes i feel extremely worthless and i don't care about those things, i just want happiness fallen from the sky... which isn't gonna happen. I'm a mess, no doubt about it... what the fuck am i doing?? I don't even know what the hell is going on with me!! I just have this feeling of being lost and going nowhere. I just want to do something that fills my life, but i feel it so goddamn empty! I want out of here, somehow... don't know! Why am i so scared of everything?? Sometimes i think i just want to be like those "risk-takers", those who doesn't care what's gonna happen next, they just do what they want... but for some reason i'm not like that... i'm always afraid of what may come next!!! That just sucks! I'm sick of being afraid!!! Fear has become a part of my life, and i don't want it to be here any longer... what is for me to do!! I wanna cry forever and don't give a shit about nothing!! I want to love, to dream, to write, to sing, to do what i like... without boundaries!!! But that's just not gonna happen.. it really sucks!! I SUCK!! Well, i shall better be going, i don't want to get angry nor hate me.... i just hope it isn't too late...

      What on earth am i doing?? One minute i was begging for love, in the next one i was leaving it behind. Anyway, it isn't the worst part of it all: everyone is getting weird ideas into my head, but why am i listening to them? I really have to work hard on that, i can't let them tell me what to think or feel. We are not so like the perfect couple or anything... that something i have to get clear. We are too much alike but that's exactly what makes us so different... what a crap! Sometimes i just wish i could be kinda normal... but when i think deeply into it, i realize i really don't wanna be so, it's nice to be weird, to be a freak... although it causes me so much troubles sometimes. Again the subject has suddenly changed... scheiße! I'll shut up my mouth for a while, i think that's better

         That's the real me..&nbsp;but because&nbsp;i like more Tarja's picture than mine that one is in my profile and not this one.   Getting back to important stuff... I'M HARDLY WAITING FOR TOMORROW AT 8PM!!!! (or is it 9??) i really think i'm gonna cry... well that isn't too hard to guess since i've cried in almost every concert i've been to... jeje i really get excited. Let's see how everything goes... meanwhile i shall make a stop...    (doing the laundry)   i'm back now... let's see, where was I?? ahh well the concert theme is over i guess. My mantra!!!!!! Cradle of Filth&nbsp;- Satanic Mantra...  Ahh i really don't know what to talk about, i have too many things in my head and i'm not thinking very clearly... so for everyone-who-read-this-thing's sake i shall shut my fingers up...  Don't die... or die.. as you please, right now i don't care.... well i do, so don't die

      My&nbsp;heart is killing me... or is it my mind?  It doesn't matter, at the end it is just the same: pain I know i won't die for loving you, i'm still alive I know i won't cry for your love, it's already mine The only truth i know is that there's darkness around us bluring our sight and blinding our souls. I also know my aim is to be at your side feeling your warmth and breathing your life. But&nbsp;i had been cursed with an eternal tormented love. I'm afraid of bringing your life down into ruins i'm scared of ripping your heart with my unmercyful hands i&nbsp;don't want my despicable soul to be in touch with yours i don't want my acid&nbsp;tears to melt down your body I'm under the spell of fear and despair but underneath both of them, i love you. I will just love you in the darkness of&nbsp;death... were i'll be able to.

      Lacrimosa is coming!!!! Just thinking about the whole scene of being there in the middle of their music makes my heart beat out of its place...  Although i'm tired... exhausted really. Taking care of my mother was harder than i thought.. it's not that i wouldn't have done it, i would have anyway, but its horrible to sleep at 12am and wake up (or being waken up) at 7am or even earlier... well, i don't want to talk about my awful days, it has been enough by living them.. i'm just pleased that my mother is getting better, its a great relief.  I just wanted to talk about something... write about something. I'm sick of this, i think i want to die after the concert.. it would be the most amazing death i could get.... aaggrrhh no!!! i won't talk about my death though those images are coming up to my head again... hate it!!  Let's talk about.... my writing.. i hate it too, but there's nothing else to talk about. I'll write down here somethings i wrote the last week:   "...sentí&nbsp;mi alma cayendo, congelada, a los pies de la esperanza (...) dentro de mí había un espíritu lleno de fragilidad, al borde de la desesperacion..."   "El corazón dentro de mí derramó una lágrima de ira pero se contuvo de gritar su dolor. Me sentí tan sola, tan abandonada, sin una mano de ayuda ni un brazo de apoyo. Sólo mi madre y yo; ella sufriendo, yo agonizando; yo cuidando de ella, nadie cuidando de mi."   To end this writing i'll say my mantra to give me strength:  "Archangel, Darkangel,  &nbsp;lend me thy light  through death's veil  until we have heaven in sight"

      I'ts been a while since i haven't written anything in here, but i've been out of this business a litte. I just want to post something to remember i have this thing.  A couple of minutes ago, searching for my nickname i found spmething kind of nice somewhere inside my mind: "Alone and afraid... breathing despair and walking beside death... With no one to love... nevermore." Sad but true.  Since some days, i've wanted to cry with someone, because crying alone does not calm me down anymore, at least this time it didn't. Bad luck, there is no one to cry with, no one who can listen to my sorrows, no one to hug me... just no one. The only thing i can do i wait in here, wait for that which i know will not come.&nbsp;I'll&nbsp; try to be strong and bear my pain. I've been longing for some hope, for perfect love... such a foolish illusion! Anyway&nbsp;i know i'll be here waiting for some of it to come, a little hope, a bit of love. Meanwhile, i'll be trying to carry on with this process of time called life, or&nbsp;trying not to die...&nbsp;or at least enjoy the effort.

      Some quotes not from me:  &nbsp;  "She imagined a specter who told her that, if she wanted, she could still walk to the square, she could still find a man who could ask: "Do you want to be my girlfriend?" But the silence and the night inside her house said: No one."  &nbsp;  "The world's last explosion. My blood splattered on the wall. My body, my shattered head, fell on the floor."  &nbsp;  "Almost in silence i say: "love". The word hovers before me for long into the night, amid sounds, amid gestures."  &nbsp;  "The word stops and i remember you like a penetrating knife. The infinite blade of a knife infinitely thrust into me. An eternity has passed since you left me alone among the shadows of the night."  &nbsp;  "Now, in this moment. I don't know where you are. I imagine you doing so many things. I imagine you not remembering me."  &nbsp;  "I saw you leave. Your footsteps drawing away from me. You entered your house as if you were leaving me forever. You were leaving me forever."  &nbsp;  "I lost myself in the dreams we had. I gave myself up. Never again will we be able to dream. Never again."  &nbsp;  "I see you. I don't know if this face is you or the imagine of you in my memory."  &nbsp;  "So much to live for. So much to die for. If only my heart had a home."  &nbsp;  "If you have no one, no one can hurt you."  &nbsp;  "Suchte ich der Herrlichkeit der Zweisamkeit und fand nur der lächerliche Einsamkeit."  ("I searched the splendor of the companionship and found only the smiling loneliness.")  Some of my own:  &nbsp;  "Amor mío, eres tan frío como la luna, tan etéreo como un dios y tan falso como mis sueños."  ("My love, you are as cold as the moon, as ethereal as a god and as fake as my dreams.")  &nbsp;  "No estás en mi memoria, ni lo estarás. No estás en mi presente, ni en mi futuro. No eres nada, tan sólo tristeza y soledad, la mía."  ("You are not in my memory, neither you will be. You are not in my present, nor in my future. You are nothing, but sadness and loneliness, my own."  &nbsp;  "..otra noche más de tantas, sin mayor valor que la de ayer, sin menor esperanza que la de mañana..."  ("... one more night, with no more worth than the last one, with no less hope than the next one...")  &nbsp;  "¿Cómo puedes sostenerme siendo la brisa más sólida que tú? ¿Cómo puedes mantenerme viva siendo la muerte más real?"  ("How can you hold me if the breeze is stronger than you? How can you keep me alive if the death is more real?)  &nbsp;  "Pensando en tí olvido todos mis pesares, pues tú eres el más grande de ellos."  ("Thinking of you i forget every one of my sorrows, because you are the biggest of them.")  &nbsp;  "Es difícil sostener una promesa, pero más difícil es vivir con la culpa de haberla roto."  ("It's hard to keep a promess, but is harder to live knowing it&nbsp;has been broken.")  &nbsp;  "Daría mi todo en soledad para ser la nada junto contigo."  ("I would give my everything in solitude to be the nothing with you.")  &nbsp;  "Yo puedo pensar en una idea pero una idea no puede pensar en mí. Yo puedo amarte, odiarte, idolotrarte y olvidarte, pero tú no puedes ni imaginarme."  ("I can think&nbsp;about an idea but it can't think about me. I can love you, hate you, worship you and forget you, but you can't even imagine me.")  &nbsp;  "Te amo, te odio... y para tí, ni siquiera existo."  ("I&nbsp;love you, i hate you... and for you i don't even exist."  &nbsp;  I share these words with you (whoever "you" are) ... i hope you enjoy them as much as i do. By the way, i thought&nbsp;they would be&nbsp;a few, but&nbsp;there were too many of them that i like. &nbsp;

      This was a nice day, i can't deny that... but i was really excited about that "party" (if i can call it so). Despite the fact i wanted to get a bit drunk hehe... i wanted to go there.. i don't really know why but i was excited about it. I went to the movies, again i got there before almost everyone... so i sent a message to that girl to see if she was going to stay at my house tonight... but oohh surprise!! There wasn't gonna be any party!!!! Damn it!! I wanted it!! Anyway, i put my disappointment aside, and waited for the others to come. After a while people started arriving... we saw the movie... not bad but not so good. I was a funny day... its really amusing to see people watching us like freaks hehehe really funny... just like scaring little boys haha poor of my children... that's why i'm not planning to have any... hahaha. I'm laughing a lot, and i'm alone.. i may look like a madwoman.. but i don't care, i'm worse than that hehe. Well i don't know anymore what i'm talking about... i'm just writing because of writing... I'll finish this here, before my friend falls asleep waiting for this to be published. "Good night, good fight" (I remembered this quote from Celebrity Deathmatch", how great was that program hehehe the best of MTV-shit)                            THE END

      It's been a while since i hadn't posted anything. Not because i don't have anything to say, it's just that my living schedule has been a little weird. I sleep early in the morning and wake up at midday, so everything changes for me... i write too much a couple of hours before sleeping and in the whole day i have no inspiration. Anyway, i said these where going to be some quick words, so be it.  Tonight another letter shall be written, for the Uncoming One. Tomorrow a movies-afternoon and later... some drinks.. hope so. Now, i gotta get started with the 3rd letter to... that guy... or whatever it is.. or may be... hmmm i'd better shut up. See you later.

      Hey you! You've really let me down... somehow i thought you wouldn't do that to me, you looked so sure about not doing it, that i actually believed you... bad for me, i shouldn't have, i should have known this would happen... in fact i knew, but i just blinded myself from the truth. I wanted you to stick around forever, and be there when i needed you to be there... but i was so selfish, and now that i think deeply into it i see that i really don't want you to be there just for me, that's stupid... it's better (and healthier) for you to be there for somebody else. You've been there for me too much time, more than anyone could bear, so i thank you for it from the heart of my rotten soul. I think it may be appropriate to ask you not to get stuck on me again, it's been too much for you and i don't want that to happen to us again (i hope you know what i am talking about) I think our friendship gave what it could, and it went as far as it could go. Thank you for everything, but just forget every feeling you may still have. "Ich danke dir für all' die Liebe ich danke dir in Ewigkeit!"

      Everything seems to go with the flow. Time passes by and looks back and sees me -the one behind everyone else-. He points at me and laugh... he goes faster and leaves me alone. So here I am, in the middle of the darkness of my mind, no warm no light... no time. Blessed by the demons of the night, cursed by the eyes of the Great One above me. I can see my fate beyond me, so hazy... so sad. I don't want to keep moving, i want to be here in this nowhere... in here i'm safe, so far away from everyone. "Oh Death! Thy power so great! Release me from my pain and lead me into the burning flames of endless peace! With thy unmercyful hands rip my heart to love no more! Tear my skin to shreds as i don't want to feel any more! Smash my body and let my soul be thine... forever" In the darkness shall i remain until time comes back for me, to raise my body from the dead and give my soul new life... therefore i will reign over the shadows of my mind.

      I don't need to know any kind of witchkraft to forsee this would happen... it always happen, even when nobody wants. When one of my friends, even my dearest and closest friends, get "connected to someone" i see myself moved aside. It is something inevitable, it is something that comes in the "next-step-relation pack", so what can i do but accept it and moving on. The only thing that bothers me the most is that it was such a nice... thing. Well i shall say no more, there's nothing bad about it. It was meant to be. And for the sake of every one of us it is better like that. It's not healthy to impede something that has been written in the pages of the fate... I'm glad that it happened, i just wish the feeling to go away soon... before anything happens with me, in me. Things are better now, the sacrifice has been done, there's nothing left to do, except watch time go by...

      Robots... since i remember people has always thought about robots and all those cybernetic issues. I don't like them at all, when i was a child i could, because they were something like fascinating to me, but now i really appreciate natural life. Could you imagine getting into a building and hearing a voice who welcomes you and tells you what to do next?? I would became absolutely insane!! Even more... is that posible? I would kill myself before getting used to it, some weird humanoid telling you what's best for you, or helping you with everything... aahh!! How useless would the human race become!! I understand now why the machines would raise up against humans... they would do everything, so they would controll everything. That would give them the right to rule over us... what a fucking mess!! I insist, i love living in this time... i guess it is better than how it may be.. or at least like they show it in the futurist movies... Anyway, i 'm writing stupidities, i don't even know well what i am writing.. i'm almost asleep, so i shall better go to bed, before one creepy humanoid robot comes to tell me to go to bed, because it is not healthy to be awake at 1:39 a.m. See you, and beware of the robotic artificial life...

      It's broken!!!!!! At last... i had to bear the truth: there was no way out, it was going to break anyway, no matter how much i take care of it... :'( I was so sad.. more than 1 cm!!!!! I got a new record!! But i wanted it to grow more... or at least not to break so much!! Anyway, it has already happened... i'll just have to wait for it to grow again. So i hope i'll see it that long again in 3 months or so. Too sad but bearable... i guess. Well there's something good about fingernails, they're always growing...

      Why do i feel? Why do i think? Which one is the best? Sometimes i believe i think too deep; some others i believe i feel too much. When i think i see only for myself, what's best for me, what makes me feel better and more comfortable... i think about  me . But when i feel i just worry about the other people involved, what's best for them, what may make them feel better and more comfortable... just worry about  them . So what the fuck is going on with me??!!! I know everything comes from the same place: my mind. But then, why is it so much trouble with two "things" which come from the same place?? Why can't i think and feel just what's necessary; think when i have to and feel when i want to. But life can't be so beautiful, nor my mind. I have to be complicated then i wouldn't be a woman, right?? Or rather wouldn't be a human. Anyway, this is me... this is my life, so i'd better get used to it, used to the continuous fight between Feelings and Thoughts...

      No words for it.... absolutely wonderful, magnificent.... i guess the best concert i've been to! Just amazing... everything was great, unbelievable. Having this genious a few steps away from me was so exciting! The music!! The voice!! Everything was perfect!! But when they started with "Ich verlasse heut' dein Herz".. my goddess!! it was incredible! I was shaking like if i was having an epilepsyc attack jeje i screamed like if someone was gonna rape me... well not really, no one has ever tried to rape me so i don't know how that scream would be... Anyway, that song... and the other... and everything was awesome... i loved that concert! Everytime i hear one of the songs they played i inmediately remember the whole scene and everything so beautiful... if i die one of these days i woulnd't do it so sad and miserable jeje i'm getting better. Although, i don't want to die yet.. too many other concerts to go to
