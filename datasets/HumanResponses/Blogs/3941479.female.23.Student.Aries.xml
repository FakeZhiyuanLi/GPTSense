       Okay so becoming a Christian hasn't meant I've given up everything that is 'bad' but I have really made an effort to not go any further with a guy than maybe a kiss and a hug. Not because I feel that I have to but because it's really pretty logical no that's the wrong word to use but I'm not going to think of another one... because if you jump straight into bed with each other everything gets complicated and there isn't really any surprises anymore. If im honest with myself I'd have to say that sex changes everything, if I sleep with someone straight away I'm usually less inclined to really get to know them. Where as if your not going to sleep with them you can actually get to know a lot more... like the little stuff that I never really bothered to find out about my ex, just stuff that you find out when you are talking with a person till all hours of the night rather than getting hot and sweaty. Don't get me wrong I did still have a heart to hearts with my previous partner but the information I found out I should have already known. That's just my thoughts on the subject.       But back to the tempting bit, I guess I'm finding it hard to resist going back to the oh this'll be fun kind of attitude, it's not as easy as it sounds to just not get together with someone you actually have to work at it :-) I mean I figured I would but just not this hard. Why do you males out there make it so difficult?       Ah well guess I'll just have to come up with some new strategies any ideas?

         You leave your umbrella at work and it's forecase to rain the next day    You just want to talk to another human being and noone is around    You forget to do those readings that are 'so important' for your next class     Ah the great wonders of&nbsp;life.&nbsp; Well no not really, I've sucessfully completed all fo the&nbsp;above today&nbsp;flippin fantastic.&nbsp; Oh well I'm still&nbsp;smiling so it can't be that bad right?&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually had a decent day at work today,&nbsp;kids seemed reasonably happy and were pretty good at following instructions which isn't a usual occurance for the great afterschool&nbsp;crowd, maybe they'd been blasted by thier teachers or something I don't know.     Anyhow life goes on, nothing much else to report today :) &nbsp;

       Well it's been an interesting few weeks.&nbsp; I've completed my block course in science and assessment :) Yahoo!!! Now we're on to the rest of the semester, not looking too bad although the workload is up on last semester.     I still can't believe how much God is working in my life at the moment, he just gives me what I need to carry on and I really think he's reaffirming that teaching is one of the purposes he has for my life. It's reassuring to know that I actually have a direction in life, finally!&nbsp; I feel really settled and I hope that everyone has sometime in thier lives when they feel as full as this because it's awesome!!  I was reading over a few things I jotted down before I became a christian the other night the change I've experienced has been pretty steady over the past few months.&nbsp; I guess I haven't really noticed it but when I looked back over what I had written my words are quite different now, my whole attitude in my writing seems to be a lot more focused, a lot happier and less worried about things that I have no control over.

       Welcome to my little blog on the net&nbsp;...  This is my first&nbsp;post yepee!&nbsp; I haven't quite decided exactly what I'll&nbsp;use this&nbsp;space for yet, at the moment it't just a place to blab about anything and everything do&nbsp;join in :).  I've got no holiday left :( yesterday was the official last day of school holidays it's back to college on Monday... good and bad things go with that move... good I get to catch up with everyone, bad more work more study more stress hrmm lots more bad than good there at the moment.&nbsp;  Oh well I'll live.&nbsp; That's all for now folks as this is getting rather uninteresting.&nbsp;
