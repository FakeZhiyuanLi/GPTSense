      My first steps to Athens happened today as I saw the Olympic Torch pass through Venice, CA.  The Flame has a long road ahead before it reaches Athens but I have a feeling that date will come much sooner than I would like.  The Flame and I are about 2 months away from settling into our temporary home in Athens, Greece for the 2004 Summer Games!

      Another day stuck in the office.  It is really getting hard to stay awake all day in this chair but I’m doing the best I can.  Last night and today were very windy outside and there was lots of talk of rain.  Judging by the blue sky and sparse clouds I would think it is not going to happen.  Not too much else to report.  Hopefully I can find my way into a more exciting day this week.  I have to keep my readers happy.   Maybe I will try and sneak over to the pool to catch Thorpe and Phelps square off tonight.

      If I thought I was tired yesterday I didn’t know what I was talking about. I worked from 8 AM to about 1 AM and was an absolute wreck when I finally made it home. Getting into the office at 9 AM this morning was a chore in itself. But everyone is pulling together nicely and sucking it up.  Last night there was a pretty big power failure over at the Olympic Club and some surrounding areas. Nothing alarming just a normal surge of some sort. Also, apparently some British reporter has been sneaking suspicious packages into some of the venues in a vain attempt to test security. This is unbelievable that someone would pull a bonehead stunt like this. One of his false packages was discovered and thus forced a large area to be shut down for a few hours. In effect shutting down many buss lines and forcing many people to change accommodations. Asides from these bumps I’d say everything is moving smoothly. Since I have been inside all day, Eugene gave me a day pass to have dinner at that same club that had the power failures. I hope everything is straightened out because the food there is supposed to be excellent.  P.S. I have to confess I am starting to feel like Doogie Howser with this little journal thingy. It’s probably just the insanity kicking in, but I’m not going to let it stop me. Thus of course I start seeing Vinni Delfinno climbing in my window at night.

      It is very odd to for me to be calling Day 1 of the Olympics Day 10 but for our purposes this will do. Today was an incredibly unexciting yet busy day within the Getty office. With Mary out on location I have been imprisoned at my desk taking edit after bloody edit (damn Brits are rubbing off on me). As an editor I understand this is my job, but being short one full body made this a very arduous day. The upside is that I work for the greatest photography company in the world. And the bulk of the pictures I looked at today were from last nights amazing (for us TV watchers) show. If you have not looked at some of the pictures from the opening then you are missing out.   I cant make a direct link but you can find them at:   urlLink http://editorial.gettyimages.com   If you dont know the site you may have to look around for them.   I apologize for the straightforward day without much gossip or grit but we are all a little tired from the very late night last night.

      Today started out with a Visa Sponsored event at Polis Park near downtown Athens. Unfortunately I got early phone calls saying the event was pushed up and we had to get there much earlier. This turned out not to be the case so again I sat around for nearly 2 hours just waiting for it to start. All the while thinking about the breakfast I missed and how hungry I am. This event was an art competition for Olympic related art created by 9-13 year old kids. I was really impressed by the quality of some of the work, probably better than I could do. There were some big names at this event; the Prince of Jordan, Prince Albert of Monaco and some of the Greek Women’s Track Athletes.  After returning to the office I learned that Lisa’s grandmother passed away and unfortunately has to leave for home right away. This is a big loss for Lisa and for the Getty team. Mary and maybe I will be filling in for her at some of the events, and we are all going to have to muscle up to cover the slack. We all wish her and her family the best.  Beyond that, tonight is the opening ceremonies of the games. I must admit I am a little upset I only get to view this amazing event from the TV next to my desk. Regardless Im sure it will be one to remember.

      After about 4 1/2 hours of sleep I woke up probably still drunk but able to pull myself together and get to breakfast. After eating I drove off with Matt Stockman to a Speedo Volleyball Clinic and BBQ. I was hoping to meet Kerri Walsh and other pros but none of them decided to show up. This caused us to have to sit around and twiddle our thumbs until they could come up with another plan. It was set a beautiful private beach owned by Speedo. Eventually they convinced me and some other media into participating in the clinic just so they had some people on the courts. I felt like a fool playing out there with Matt shooting but anything for the team, right? After that the Greek women’s team showed up and took the stage. Matt shot them and then shot the BBQ. Apparently they didn’t get all the model shots they needed from the other day so they called one of them back to finish up out on the sand. The model they brought in was huge and didn’t fit into all of the suits so they absolutely conned me into squeezing into the one of the Body Suits. If that wasn’t bad enough it was a Swedish suit. Sorry Denmark you know where my love really is. That was humiliating and very painful. This is what you may call taking one for the team, you’re welcome Getty. (It must be noted that this picture will not be released) In the end I shouldn’t be complaining after spending the day at the beach.  p.s. Chris Chambers got 1/2 of his luggage and we got our A/C fixed, maybe his luck is changing!

      Well as expected the Getty dinner was quit an adventure.  It was set at some back alley restaurant that had the most beautiful balcony and view I have ever seen.  Nearly the entire Getty crew sat out under the stars and the acropolis to a great dinner and lots of drinks.  When midnight rolled around and the buss was leaving only about 5 people got on it.  The rest of us drank for free until about 2:30.  We all spilt up into cabs and proceeded to create the Athens Cannibal Run back to the Village.   Needless to say our cab smoked the rest but maybe a little too fast.  At one point he was doing 120 km/hr through traffic.  None of us enjoyed that but we got home in one piece, drunk and stumbling.  As I was checking into my apartment I witnessed the police giving Doug Pensinger a ride home because he couldn’t make it up the hill alone.  The next morning I heard one of the U.K. guys got his head split open after someone threw a street cone at him.  Isn’t that lovely!

      Only 7 days in and it feels like a month.  Funny thing is the games have not even started.  Today consisted of mainly office work with a few events to edit.  Not a whole lot to report.  Tonight is the big Getty team dinner at some swanky restaurant overlooking the acropolis.  This is going to be one of the best nights yet.   Although there has been signs of bad luck going around.  My roommate, Chris Chambers, still has not received any of his luggages, our A/C has not once worked (I blame his luck) and today he went to the hospital after hurting his ankle.  Another member, who will remain nameless, had taken very ill to some food he had last night.  I ate with him but thankfully my stomach remains completely intact.  I am going to be a bit more leery of the foods I eat.

      Today started out very slow, or should I say I started out very slow.  Had a bit too much to drink last night because the entire Getty crew showed up and had a welcome celebration.  Judging by the looks on a lot of their faces they had as miserable travels as I did.  Nevertheless Getty knows how to party under any condition.     The rest of the day was spent in front of my laptop making Sponsor Athlete Schedules and editing some Party photos.  Aside from being attacked by the Olympic Mascots not much happened today.

      I started today thinking it was going to be a boring office day but instead I got sent out with Matthew Stockman for a Speedo Model shoot.  The location was an outdoor nightclub settled on the beach over looking the Aegean Sea.  Wow, this was a spectacular shoot.  Although it got very hot in the sun and the models were very unprofessional, I had a great time.  The models caused this to run very long but they loved our work and asked for us to come back later in the week for a Speedo Athlete shoot.  Now I’m back in the office working on the pictures.  The rest of the Getty crew is arriving now so it should be great to go have a beer with the whole bunch!

      Later that night, I went with a small group downtown to a street side restaurant just below the Acropolis for dinner.  The view was amazing and so was the food.  This was the side of Athens I wanted to see but won’t have many chances too.  Let’s hope for more!

      It has been a pretty straightforward day so far. I woke up feeling like hell from not sleeping at all, damn jet lag. Our AC is not working so we had to arm wrestle the staff to get their tools out and fix it (still not sure if they have). After that it was into the office for boring desk work. Just before lunch I took a stroll around the Olympic Plaza with Jennifer Johnson and Matthew Stockman. Although it was amazing to see these massive structures it was a bit sad. The construction is really far behind and I can’t imagine how it can be ready in 4 days for Opening Ceremony. There are boxes, fences, cranes and other construction junk everywhere. I’m sure when it is aired on TV they will be able to mask garbage but for those of us here the Wizard is obviously a dirty little guy behind a very small curtain.

      This is my first full day in Athens.  Woke up early to a great free breakfast and a fairly reasonable buss ride to the Main Press Center (MPC).  This is a beautiful building with many floors of various stores and work areas.  Our office area is great.  Everything was set up and ready for us when we got here and there is lots of food and drinks.  After toiling on some boring office work (which should be most of my daily work, sorry) I was sent out with 4 others back to the airport to pick up some rental cars.  This was great.   It is difficult to call these things cars being as small as they are but were more like large go carts.  The drive back was very exciting.  We caravanned these Euro Go Carts in and out of traffic and had our own little European car chase.  After returning it was back to boring office work which filled the rest of my day.  I’m off now to dinner and hopefully sleep (so tired still).

      Not too sure I can call Day 2 a day at all but for our purposes here it is.  The combination of 1 hour naps and changing time zones has completely altered my sense of date and time.  Beyond that I have thankfully arrived into the great city of Athens.  We have been graciously taken in as part of the Olympic Family and are being treated like celebrities.  They welcomed us at the airport and swiftly moved us on our way to our housing accommodations.  Chris Chambers (roommate, oh wait Europe, flat mate)  found out quickly that we have NO WORKING A/C in our sauna.  Aside from that I am very impressed with the housing.  After a quick unpack we moved up to the outdoor dining area and ordered up many Heinekens.   Off to bed (not to sleep but rather toss and turn and attempt to right my slept schedule).

      LAX Airport It is official now, I am off and running to the ruined and apparently rebuilt city of Athens. Fortunately for my coworkers I left my loincloth at home and packed 2 full bags of clothes and electronic toys. To escort me on my travels I have been bestowed the honor of carrying one of my fellow coworker’s equipment bags, which was so eloquently described to me as very small. Small yes, but unmentioned to me was the bags surprising weight. Apparently it is not so difficult to stuff 60+ pounds of equipment into a very small bag. Lucky me, thanks Donald.  Flight from LAX to Kennedy If you find yourself sitting near an open seat on an airplane with 5 minutes left before takeoff you might think this is a good thing. At least I did, until a 250 pound Rabi decided to waddle his way down the aisle and squeeze himself into the chair beside me. Unfortunately these chairs were not designed for men of his “statue” so any overflow was taken upon by me. I didn’t see my right armrest for the entire 6 hour flight to New York. I’m sure it would have been nice to be able to change the channel on my TV but instead of fighting my holy friend I told myself sitting with a rabbi was good luck and I should enjoy watching VH1 instead of the many new movies that were being offered. Some New Yorker on the far side of the plane made a point of yelling across to me when the Rabi left, claiming that I deserved the Gold Medal for handling this. So I guess I will be leaving the games with a medal. MOST TOLERANT TRAVELLER MEDAL!
