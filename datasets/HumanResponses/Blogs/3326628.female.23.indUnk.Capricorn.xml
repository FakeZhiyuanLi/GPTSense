      Man, I love this show.  The writing is pretty tip top, but the actors and their deadpan humor make the show genius.  Hopefully the American version will do the Britich original justice.  Don't count on it with the censors we have to deal with.

      I just listenend to the new Wilco album that is due out June 22.  It is simply an amazing listen.   Now, this is a band that plays music simply because they have no choice, they love doing it for themselves and their fans.  They release their albums online months before commercial release and still hundreds are lined up on the day of the album's release to buy it.  That's what you call trust.

      ACNE!!!  I have had it since the onset of puberty, but very minimal and normal like any other teenager.  Last fall is when it took a turn for the worse.  I think it had to do with the fact that your body changes every 7 years, and my time of change had come - just not the change I had expected.  You think your acne will go away along with your teenage years, but no, my acne got worse, the kind that are deep, painful, and leave red marks for weeks.  I was clueless on how to deal with it.  It wasn't a simple matter of hygiene or diet, it was infection and pain - both physiological and physical.  I tried Proactiv, toothpaste, neosporin, everything over the counter for a couple months and finally went to the gynecologist to see if the birth control pill could rid me of this hormonally linked problem.  I started on that, but no changes in my skin had taken place.  I graduated college a couple months later, and went home in the middle of winter depressed, but with an appointment to a dermatologist at the suggestion of my mom.  The derm prescribed me a oral antibiotic and 2 topicals.  I saw some results after 6 weeks, no more deep and painful lesions, but the persistent acne was still there.  I was still was so hopeless and alone.  I really don't think people know what persistent acne sufferers go through, unless they have had it themselves.  It has nothing to do with vanity.  It goes so much deeper than that.  Anyways, I came across a website (I have become very proficient in this area) called  urlLink Acne.org  which basically suggests a Benzoyl peroxide regimen.  Well, after regular visits to the site and further frustrations with the doctor's medicines, I tried the regimen.  Let me just say, it worked within a week.  It was my miracle.  My face is about 99% clear.  I don't know why I hadn't tried it earlier.  All I know now is that in some sort of odd way, I am thankful for my experience with acne.  It made me even more humble and more aware of others in similar situations.  Every time I am out and see someone with bad acne, I want to shout out "Acne.org".  Suffering isn't overrated, but one can not do it forever without going mad.

      but blood, toil, tears, and sweat."  Winston Churchill said this 64 years ago today, as he had just been elected new Prime Minister of England three days prior.  He also inherited a world war, further ensuring his fellow allies that victory would come "at all costs, victory in spite of terror, victory however long and hard the road may be."  Yeah, I know it sounds familiar.  I'm sure something similar has been said at numerous times throughout the history of wars.  It's the only rational way to go about such an event.  I doubt very much that  urlLink Abraham Lincoln  put a casualty maximum or time limit on the Civil War.  He kept fighting.  Victory ensued.  The country was reconstructed, slavery slowly abolished, but not before the 16th president of the United States was shot and killed, along with numerous others.  The first presidential assassination in American history had occurred and was thus the ultimate price to pay for victory.  Perhaps the dramatic reminder of mortality sealed his immortality.  Is death, suffering, and pain necessary for victory, for triumph, for peace?  Does one's life have to pass before our eyes before we get it?  I don't know.  Clouds rain upon the ground, and we end up with floods  and  the alleviation of famines.  There isn't a clear cut argument for or against war.   urlLink $50 billion , however, is nowhere near the cost of one casualty.  What do we have left to win when we have already lost so much.

      It really isn't a question of whether or not to do so, but rather a question of where and on what.  I have blogged every day for the past 23 years in my thoughts, essays, and arguments.  It is now time to put it into a modern medium, a more colorful and legible form.  So here it is, a page dedicated to me, myself, and I, on what I love, even if it will never love me back.
