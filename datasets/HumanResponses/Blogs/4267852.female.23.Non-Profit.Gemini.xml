      Am I the only one who can't seem to get into Friendster? People wax philosophical all day long about the benefits of connecting with others through this site, but it has never really worked for me. I don't have a million "friends" and no one has ever written me out of the blue to see how I am doing. I stopped checking out friendster regularly and I have A LOT of time on my hands during work. So what does that say about me? Am I repulsive to my friends? Do they repulse me? I don't know. I just can't get into the whole idea. What is the point? In a fit of anti-friends rage---I joined myspace. Damn. It is just like friendster and yet oddly I am more into it. It is kind of slutty, which is more up my alley than the clean, white bread nature of friendster. Plus, people actually go looking for me or someone like me. Okay, they don't go looking for me because I am "in a relationship" which translates into I probably won't let you into my panties. Why? Because I am good girlfriend, that's why! Then, in a complete mental lapse---I joined a yahoo group for my high school in MN. What was I thinking!!! I don't want these people to "find" me there. I mean, if they were looking for me it better be on something cool and hip like friendster or myspace and not some lame-o yahoo group. I am unsubscribing today. I can't be that girl. Not today. Not ever.  On a side note: Boy wrote me a lovely testimonial on friendster today. It reads:  "Whether you'd rather believe that I'm HER man-toy or that she's MY lady, doesn't matter. Fact is she's the Princess. When at night she turns away from me, what may seem like cold rejection is really her calculated scheme to get me to rub her back. And in lieu of lullabies, she prefers my fingers softly combing her hair. Make no mistake, folks, Mindi never sleeps. I could massage her until the sun breaches the horizon, and she'd never quit of her quiet, little, adorable moans. You have to hand it to a woman who wants what she wants and gets it. Right now she's got me thinking about a manicure. Sometimes my nails are jagged and they hurt."  Damn, is that sweet or what?!  Maybe I will keep my friends(ter) after all.

      I have never liked going to Little Italy. I can't figure out which restaurant has better pasta and the hosts pleading for me to eat at "the only good restaurant on Mulberry" never helps. I'm not even sure Italians still live there. It seems that the only time I ever head down that way is when someone comes in from out of town and wants to see "Little Italy". It deserves quotations because that is how they say it to me. I can practically feel the Midwest drip out of their mouths as they exclaim excitedly about "Little Italy" and maybe even a trip to "Chinatown" for a fake Louis Vuitton! Last night the boy and I met up with a friend from out of town and her mom to experience the wonders of fake bags and overpriced pasta. Strangely though, I had a good time. Perhaps it was the quiet knowledge that mom would be paying and so I didn't have to find the only pasta dish on the menu that went for $8 and inevitably had peas. No, last night I ordered the special, which always means more expensive. But, I didn't order a salad so I felt justified in my, I mean her, splurge. It was a beautiful NY night. We ate outside, laughed, talked, and drank lots of wine. Suddenly, Little Italy didn't feel quite so bad. In fact, I was starting to enjoy myself when suddenly I remembered that we still had to pick up the fake bags next door.  *sigh*

      You didn't think that I only worried about apartments and employment all year, did you? Nope, because I am starting to realize that would have been easy.  And  easy  and  New York  are never synonymous unless a trust fund rolls into town.  Seeing as my parents are just your average "go to college, but you will have to take out loans and get scholarships" kind of folks there was no such fund established for my eventual emancipation. Sure, I could have lived at home in stunning MN--land of artic winters and "Ya, Sure, Ya betchas", but then what would I tell the grandkids?  I did what most people do when they first decide they want to move East....I moved to Ohio. Ohio was as East as I could make it at 18 and I paid for that decision every day I went to class and passed one conservative Republican after another. So, I had a small detour in my dreams of the Big City before I finally made it here. Okay, I had two detours. The morning I went to catch my flight on Sun Country from MSP to JFK I missed my plane. MISSED IT!! After some tears I thought I could just catch a flight later that day. No such luck, because po-dunk Sun Country wasn't flying to my new home for 2 more days. I hung my head in shame, went back to the middle of nowhere, and waited for my mom to come home from work and see me sitting on the couch staring at the wall that I shouldn't have seen again until Christmas.  Four years and two days later I made it to New York. And I wouldn't dream of being anywhere else.

      July 2004 marked my first year as a New Yorker. Okay, okay, so I still forget to say "soda" instead of "pop" and I will be dammed if I can remember that it is "on line" instead of "in line", but I am working on it. Off topic? Maybe. But I am getting to the important stuff: namely, how I ended up living in 5 apartments and having 3 jobs in a matter of one year.  I moved to New York after graduation from a small liberal arts college like every other Midwestern with half a brain to do anything with their life. A good friend took me in with my two suitcases and less money than any sane person should bring with them when they are moving to a new place with no job and no home.  My first three weeks of living in a dining room in Inwood produced one job that lasted three days. I hate to admit it but I paid a steep price in karma when I canvassed for Save the Children. It was I who asked you for your money and it was you who turned me down everytime. Needless to say that I look at people who shove flyers in my face differently. My karmic dues are officially paid for all the times that I held my hand up to someone trying to sell me something. Afraid that I would end up starving in my new home I went to the Gap to find employment. I walked in and I simply couldn't do it. I continued for a walk trying to convince myself that I should turn around, go back, and ask for an application. Before I could move away from the New York Look quickly enough: a summer dress inticed me in. After browsing for a minute and realizing that my no job, no apartment self could never afford anything in this store--I asked for a job. The next day I was a commission bitch. I hawked over-priced clothes to housemoms and soap stars. Sure, Yoko Ono came in once, but really I was a slave to my sales and in constant war with the other "personal shoppers".  After a week of working, I moved with my boyfriend (also a new New Yorker) to a three room apartment in Gramercy with 3 Irish students. In typical "I'm broke and living on bagels" fashion--the shower was in the kitchen and the Irish didn't ever wear pants. And if you think that my Finnish skin is pale than you have never seen an Irish person sweat, half-naked in the August heat and humidity. I shudder to remember. After two years of dating my boyfriend we almost called it quits on those unbearable nights in a twin bed.  Fast forward a month, boy and I still together, and now I am moving across the street with a pregnant British woman who doesn't work, but has a sugar daddy. It turns out that she broke up with her baby's daddy before she realized that she got knocked up. Fair enough, but after the test was positive she comes to find out that daddy (the baby's, not hers) is married with numerous children. And the drama begins. Sure, if I had a bedroom I could have come home and shut the door, but I was sleeping in her living room. About midway through September I come to my senses and got a new job that had benefits and stable pay at the "University" as it will be called from here on out. Pregnant British woman decided to move back home to the other island and give birth to her baby. I wish her luck and hope that her sugar daddy will still pay her bills from across the world.  Move number 4: Off to Harlem I go. Perhaps the most depressed I have ever been was the four months that I lived there. For my own sanity purposes let's just say that I lived there, it was awful and I got the hell out at the first opportunity.  And my final move to date...7 months of happiness and bliss all rolled up into a tight little Chelsea ball. After months of transition and upheaval I finally found a cute studio apartment for a steal. It pays to know people who love their boyfriend enough to move in with him and sublet their own space to you indefinitely. Since the last snowfall I have been really living in New York. Going out. Playing. Exploring. Shopping. So, maybe I have only really  lived  in New York for seven months. Then again, no one said this was going to be easy, but damn has it been fun.  Oh, and in case you are wondering, I still work at the University--a year later. More on that later, because next week I am transferring within the office. Would that mean that I have had 4 jobs? Yikes!  Now, you know part of my story. And there is only more to come. If that was my first year...I can only imagine what my second year holds. Fame? Fortune? Who knows? Well, maybe my psychic. She says that good things are going to happen in early September. Sit tight for that excitement.
