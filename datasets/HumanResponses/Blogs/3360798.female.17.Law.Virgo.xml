      Hey so sorry about that little HIATUS...I had made an executive decision to halt the chronicle for a while and then on the advice of a best friend, actually wrong article advice of THE best friend I decided to rock the mic yet again and take you down the path that is pure ADD chaos. So ill pick up from last saturday.   last saturday was arabfest part 2, a little reunion if you will. So the day started at about 4 oclock when me and tmoney went to get some berrs for later saturday night. Of course no problems at the trusty liquor store. Then we went back to get more and were short 3 dollars. Being a very understanding non-english speaking clerk, the kind darker skinned man decided to let us off and he just told us to come back and pay him next time. This made me happy because 1. were underage 2. we got it cheaper than listed and 3. he basically invited us back for a little reunion. Good times. After that we went to go play and it started to rain and of course we just had to go outside because we're stupid. So me being a very trusting and individual, i decide to listen to tmoney the supposed voice of reason and go out in sandals because she couldnt give me her dads shoes because that would just be too weird i think. BUt anyway we got way soaked and looking back it was funny because the open beers got so watered down. I felt like i was swimming. And my skin disorder visited me so i pruned up. But it was ok because my best friend came through and saved us from this disasterly fate of sinkage and we went to ROZIES. But i had to pee on the way because otherwise i would have gone pee pee in my pants. It was cool though. Mr slumber bag stayed with me the entire time. and Sue was there! But anyway we went to rozies and were greeting with a plethora of beverages. It was a good time. I would have hoped it would have started earlier ended later. But i have no complaints and my best friend drank her 40s LIKE A CHAMP MOTHER FUCKER. I was proud like a mom or dad or best friend. Oh so then it was sunday and we went to Huck Finn. I was a little sad billy bogart was missing. but what can you do right. Did you know freddie prinze is latino. yea well he is. Anyway, we went out to eat the next day then i went home and I cant really remember but i think i proceded to drink, or i might have just done my homework.  i cant remember much anymore. I mean i remember stuff but not right away, like this whole year has been a hazy memory of something really great. Its the last week of school and it feels like shit just flew by. It was such a great year, we became full fledged alcoholics for a while and maybe we had some great times. the dance party really set the tone for the year i think and the prostys really conquered almost everything. But i think it was just a very well rounded year. Intellectually as well. Me and reilly shared some good thoughts and she read my stuff, im still waiting to read hers haha. i keed. But you know what it was a good school year and they say its supposed to be hard but it really wasnt that bad at all. It was some good laughs, a relatively small ammount of drama and much love. Oh yea i could take this time to talk about how awesome my best friend is, but i already know that, i hope she already knows that and if you have spoken with me in the last month or so you would already know that too. because the best-age has reached an all time obsessive level for me. yea so whatever back off.  oh so to continue on with the week. basically nothing too spectacular. just got to keep my grades up and stuff for finals. i talked to my best friend alot, and the seniors graduated, the place feels empty and were the oldest kids now which feels retarded because im too immature to have seniority. But you better recognize it now mother fuckers. But anyway i dont really care about that stuff so much now, i probably will next year. Maybe with the help of many parties we can resurrect what weve been wanting to. and this summer we can define the plan more. The parties involved know what im talking about. aka sterk reilly and others. ok so i think i drank this week or else that was last week. I mean during the weekdays i cant even remember really. I just know i went like 7 days strong with the help of my best friend. AND my online drinking game flower was BOGARTED. hell yea. but i cant remember much as i have said, so i will just leave it with i had some good times last week and what not. mostly due to my best friend, also due to other people who make me laugh. i had to go to gaelic on wednesday right after i was drinking. it was hard and my legs still arent used to lang all that well with all that water polo shit. ill get used to it though, i cant wait for summer. it should prove to be a very very fun time. Collars up. slow ride, take it easy.

      well yea so i missed a day, suck it. ill fill you in on the events of thursday. i went to school pero i did not have lunch but i had beerlunch and dinner. yea it was a little random but i guess it was a good time, actually it WAS a good time. I think its something to do with hillbillys, bogarting, billys, and 40s, oh and best friends too. maybe its the water but i dont know what the fuck i just wrote and im too lazy to go back and redo it. pretty much everyone likes paul mcCartney and wings. even if you dont you kind of have to because hes such a nice guy. the only problem ive ever had with that bastard michael jackson was when he jewed out paul on the rights to those beatles songs. thats just not cool. sorry for the slanderous and offense attack on jewish people. i retract the statement.  but actually its 4:37 and im supposed to tell of the events of thursday which had grahm crackers ( i think theres an h in the word grahm i just dont know where so i inserted it just in a nice place) well there was grahm crackers and popsicles and 40s and i dont think anyone got naked. i usually start to remember things by now but im drawing blank. oh well i think the point of the story is that ive decided i have alcohol induced sleep disorder. i wont go into detail because i swear i dont drink. i do like to watch movies in school and you should also try putting your forehead on a cold metal surface. its a good refresher if your hot or tired, or both even. this makes no sense. but hey that rozie-a-palooza is soon like in t minus 24 hours. i do hope it lives up to expectations but i think when you get a group of fucked up people together almost always something very funny happens, especially if they are all from different ethnic backgrounds. whatever. kimberly ann orozco will wear a grey or gray tie this weekend. and i will have to take a shower soon. im supposed to be a herbivore but today i ate a hotdog, it was the only food really in the house, actually thats a lie. i dont know why i went carnivore, i dont even like hot dogs that much but i do like barbeque sauce. and that might explain it. i dont know, but if i really put effort into it i bet i could try to be a herbie (PRONOUNCE H) but i dont know maybe i just want to be similar to my best friend. i like the smell of clean clothes. i used to like OAR but not so much anymore. that rhymes. i should rap. hey so i read the newspaper i found on the ground today and it had senior memories and i was thinking if i have any memories and i cant really think of any that would be good enough to constitute a good memory. so constitute rhymes with prostitute. and that my friend is a sign.  p.s.-slumber bag will get lots of action this weekend. let me tell you all about the pure loyalty of my slumber bag. hes so loyal, he never leaves me. even when im way past the mental capacity for remembering where my slumber bag is..he ends up next to me the next morning. then i usually check the call list and i realize i got way too friendly and called people again. but i guess its ok because im naked and also its always good times.   oh and i hit up the gaelic for the FIRST time this year. saw the bro tommy d and bdiddy brian ruane and the michael a. and the funny thing was all these people were in the bar together, now in a normal situation that would be considered strange....but not at gaelic park which is why i love that place and why i love the pure dysfunctionality that defines it so well. now that was very poetic of me. but what i noticed also was im way out of the shape-age. im still sore and its like friday. i think its ok though because im ready for the summer.   music at this very moment. hide your love away- the beatles watching: you pick nick   this was brought to you by celine dione.

      Today was fun, I accomplished a balanced life because was with the best friend, little bit of billybogart drinkin, went to school, went to that sports banquet, ate. Well rounded i must say. Jaja= Haha in spanish. But anyway today was just a good day all around even though i did bad on that math test. but i think it evens out because ill get B for semester and my best friend is a very good best friend. Eva thinks Im nuts. We had mooseys on today, the official prosty uniform. Haha guess what, right now my mom is doing pilates. What a cracker. Me and the Phil get mad style enjoyment out of the crazy shit my parents do. I cant really explain why today was a good day but i think it was primarily for the company of a best friend and also just because it was nice. My uniform shirt was dirty today. I wore the fanny pack. That thing is madstyle the shit. times like 30. everyone got awards and all the billys were recognized for their greatness in life. I dont have much else to say except tomorrow is already wednesday. and the day after wednesday is thursday and thursday is POWERHOUR. My favorite is when people accomplish things in sports and you totally know theyre big time alcoholics because they drink with you every weekend aka prosty sterkie. Im very happy alcoholics can achieve great things.   grace finds beauty in everything thats very poetic but im listening to the song grace by u2 and i guess it felt right to write it.   ok well i have to go read a book and not do homework and also eat a second dinner. But im sorry this post-age was under par. i try though. eileen reilly is a very very intelligent and well spoken young sex machine. i just thought id tell you all that because people ought to  know. ought is a funny word. Peace easy mother fuckers. there will be more tomorrow.

      Yes well here we are on day two of this lovely adventure into the great wide open. Its a monday and i just got home from school which was uneventful on the whole but today i realized people are too funny when they arent even trying. I also realized this year went by very fast, i mean it still feels like those all nighters from november. but i can see that we have all matured into complete dysfunctionality. im not sure thats a word. i kind of wish i could stop time at this point right before school lets out when you do nothing really and your just having good times while the weathers nice. But anyway today was pretty chill. i had ice cream today, it was free. I think free or stolen goods taste so much sweeter. im not a klepto or anything but its just good times. remember that MTV band 2gether or maybe it was together. that was also good times. I lost all the music when the computadora broke so im going to try and get all that shit back and then some. It was getting to be quite a collection. Oh if you have any recommendations please dont hesitate to bite my butt and commento.   its only monday but i wish it was later on in the week. JMac cracks me up, shes an alright lady for putting up with me. Dallas dont talk to that lady(as we storm off to get copies)  sometimes i forget i dont still play soccer but i realize there are reasons for the craziness and that maybe im just supposed to learn how to swim and play water sports. and i think that maybe i was supposed to get my best friend too. so in reality, getting all cut up was a good thing, a great thing. But you can all still suck a dick.   today we watched zoolander in biology because i dont have real school anymore just dos clases that actually involve work. it was good times.  ok well i dont have much more to say, but maybe later i will double up and write again. this little guy (best friend influence) is just going to be my account on the events that ensue. and yes it is biased and yes i came here on a canoe with moccasins. and yes im wearing them now. and yes i threw them at a fan. and yes the rubber chicken is still on the roof and yes we will retrieve him. and yes my best friend is really cool and yes drugs is now an official hilbilly. and YES im hungry and yes im will go eat some processed food because i really dont give two shits about healthy lifestyles because im not destined to lead one, because im irish. and because im irish, i was born one lucky mother fucker. Peace easy.   "aint a day goes by i dont burn a little bit of my soul"                              -neil young

      Well i was bored, actually not bored just avoiding real work. I made this because sometimes thoughts should be documented because then you can remember then without trying hard to remember them. as long as you know how to read and speak english. neither of which i am good at.   in fourth grade i think i misspelled beginning wrong on a spelling test i think i spelled it beggining. double letters get me sometimes like tennessee. or however it goes. who knows really.   ok so maybe ill document the ongoings of this weekend or whatever ok so its like the 16th of may and well that means yesterday was the 15th and that was when water polo went upstate to stevenson even though i like the prepositional phrase downstate better. but anyway back to the story so my best friend is like nuts and just gets fucking huge all the time. and all the other billys were going nuts too because they played fenwick and so the billys were raping fenwick no matter what anyone says and basically it was retarded in the end i guess i cant speak english so i wouldnt know but anyway it was rowdy and i was sad for my best friend and the billies but it was ok because pd was looking sexy and opened up mcauley to the public at like 12 when we got home to the south side. but before we arrived we had to go pick up some little 30 pack billys because thats just waht you have to do in times like these, which is just time in general and yes taht could be seen as a reference to getting drunk ALL the time but whatever. but anyway so we had billys and we bogarted all this shit this weekend and so then we went and had fun and this is a really long paragraph and im sure the punctuation isnt correct either but its too bad because im awesome. i keed really i just keed. on a lighter note on sunday morning which is today, i got a haircut and it was a decent haircut seeing as my haircutter was a drunken mex/flip. but its cool because if your best friend gives you a haircut then its OK always. and drugs delany was being all naked hillbilly because she hurt her teeth this weekend but i think its ok though because if anyone was destined to be a hillbilly it was probably drugs because well thats how life is i guess. this was rounds 2/3/4 for everyone and my wisdom teeth hurt now but i guess its just tooth because only one is in. so anyway this weekend i went 6 days without a drop of alcohol and i was starting to get cranky but then everything was ok because no matter what happens, everythings always ok.  maybe this week i will write lots of letters but im not sure maybe i will substitute this for letter writing, im not sure. maybe ill lurn how two read and right but i dout it. dicksucking hoeZ capital Z for emphasis.  i miss the prosty nights, maybe summer will be the reunion tour. Also im so ready for gaelic to start. maybe i will go tomorrow and get a good kick-around. that would be cool because i havent whipped out the football boots for months and lets just say that IM HOT in football boots. yes. correct.  i was trying to think of my favorite song but i dont have one i dont think. i mean i might have one and i just cant think right  post script: anyone who recieved(oops i before e except after c) phone calls this morning i would apologize but actually im not going to because im not sorry,(sooory) because those things are priceless  music: CSNY-Love the one your with  well we all shine on like the moon and the stars and the sun yea we all shine on, on and on, and on and on. -Instant karma

      so i dont know the last thing i wrote about and im too lazy too check. im writing this in an email now because i like the way the words look as opposed to the way they look when you have to write them in the little posting box thing. so on monday night i went to training and of course i told myself i wouldnt do anything and of course i didnt listen to myself and went ahead training anyway. i took  breaks though so it wasnt too bad. my foot swelled up madstyle afterward though. it was strange because it was my foot and toes and not my ankle. even though its all blue. like this page is. its weird i think possibly possessed because last night (tuesday) the same thing happened. it could be because i havent iced it since friday because we dont have ice here.  but anyway tuesday in the day me and maddie got some twisters and hit up the thrift and picked up some nice albums with which we paid for in quarters. and then i went swimming with sterk and jamie but i didnt want to get my hair wet so i just pretended to swim and we never had our waterpolo tournament. and then me and sterk came to the homestead and dad let us drive the bobcat thats in the backyard. the bobcat is pretty cool, its not an animal its the machine bobcat. tahts what they call them sometimes.         then no one wanted to drink or do anything so i went with sterk and james to marcys house in orlando.  and on the way home this lady put her kid into a salvation army collection box so they could steal all the things in it. it was the funniest thing ever to see a little kid climbing out of that dumpster thing. but anyway thats a horrible thing if you think about it. but its also funny too. and then i got home and talked to brian about the good old days and the funny shit that goes on now and the funny shit that went on thurs/friday. and my foot swelled up real bad so i got some chips out of the freezer and took some motrin and went to bed. i was going to read but i was very tired. oh and on the car ride out to marcys i think i made a very important decision to actively pursue going to school in ireland and in the event that i get in i will make it my number one choice and go there. its good to finally know whats up but i still gota see because im not sure with all the differences between IRL and here. and so today i woke up and mary asked me if i wanted to go eat and i said yes because i was hungry. then brian ruizzle called and we couldnt go see dodgeball anymore because i had to eat with mary instead. oh and i cant drink beers with reilly tonight because i have that game and a free dinner out at gaelic park and then ill have to take a shower and study for that bullshit class because we have a test and i dont know whats going on at all. but thats the low down, down low, no doubt.   oh and today we got the ACT problems sorted out and i should get that little number by the weekend. so thats one thing checked off my list of things to do.                                         a girl with kaleidoscope eyes  pre ps- a girl with kaleidoscope eyes- name the song and 100$ to the winner. and name the girl  ps- anyone who wants to hit up the TASTE on thursday is more than welcome because it should be a good time and hey i like beers.   pps- i hope i can play today. i dont want to run around too much because then i will get low self esteem because my foot will look like a fat lady's.   ppps-boy/girl seperate swimming perturbs me. and i still dont understand it at all. and youre not a bad best fri-end, youre just mexican. oh damn ohdamn oh damn. i keed.

      ok so i failed to explain what i did last night and on a saturday. and i will do that now.  so we hit up bridgets basement in the finest of manners and there was a cute little fridge that was stocked up and the moose juice stout was passed around but that shit just cant be good for your organs. and well we just sat around for a while in a lower of keyed manner and then i called up jack because i have that disease where you dont think about stuff and you dont think about if our behavior is rational or not, and most of the time its not. so jack was washing a pan or a pot or something along that line and then it went like secret agent style and i met jack up at my, previously her, place of education and then we proceded to make our way to crazy thumbs who has crazy thumbs like tommyd has crazy toes's house. and big lar was drinkin some beers and it was beautiful because i love seeing people drink beers. and i saw homies from the crib like kevin and lizzie drum because tahts what you do sometimes when you are a place you see people you know or have previously known. and well phil got rowdy then mary got rowdy then i just had to laugh and mary doesnt care because shes a crackhead. and today sue rode her bike over and we just sat around because we were bored and she watched us eat sandwiches. and now im wearing a green hat and i wish i was drunk. but even more than me wishing i was drunk is i wish that my best friend was drunk.   im running out of things to say, the summer hasnt been all too eventful. i have however been really really loud. it kind of sucks but i cant help it. i get yelled for it all the time though.   i miss mary therese brigid laird and her crazy ways. man thats a funny kid. mary called me up one day and said hey man i need help writing my speech for sec. because shes crazy involved with that school shit and i said sure dude make it funny about white trash and mullets and she said nahh i cant. well whatever she won her election, but the funniest thing of all is that she was running for president not secretary and she didnt even know. you fucking republican. opus dei freaks!! ahh, im only joking. but anyway mary, if you see this here give me a call because im naked and your my boy. even though your insanely rich. and on a lighter note i will continue to kick your ass in lexi-box. break yoself.   ok but anyway last night i got 67-70 the beatles burned up from suey and holy shit man i love it. and i got home early from school. a whole hour early, because we finished our shit early and we also made more friends today too. and i really wanna hit up the training tonight but if i go ill end up playing and hurting myself more so maybe ill go and bring a little lawn chair and see whats up. hopefully phil and timmy will go too so that way mary will drive and i wont have to get a ride home. ah that reminds me timmy is in town and thats just an all around good time. and i hope jack comes, little jack not best friend jack. jacks a high roller now. man i love that kid. hes a laugh. but jack, my best friend jack, is also a high roller, so much so that she doesnt have any time to keep me occupied with a little chronicling every few days. ah but its ok, i dont mind much. and i really love this cd actually 2 cds, you cant tell right now but im fucking jamming all alone by myself and i have mastered the air drums and geetar. its mastered. yea i know im a loser but i dont care. im only letting you know so that if by chance you think your loser then there are other losers out there so dont let it get you down. embrace yourself and give yourself a hug because self esteem was made up. so its a good day so far. but still no scores.   i was thinking about what my favorite thing to do is. and i dont think i have one. id automatically think drinking but i dont think its that. potentially playing the sport. yes i think that could be it. atleast top 3.   well have a good one, and take it easy. it seems to me that sean austin or maybe astin is money because think about it. the goonies, rudy, and the lord of the rings. thats versitality and fucking money in the bank. hes the good luck guy.   see how they run.   ps- i love when you can just let it play through.   pps-nothing really to say here i would just like to end on...suck it.

      well hello, its sunday. last night was slightly rowdy but funny all the same. theres a special quality when immigrant parents get mad. and its just funny because well they are immigrants. and then if you are an immigrant yourself, then its twice as funny.   so today we might go to the taste and that will be fun but i dont want to walk around alot so that will kind of suck a little bit, what are you going to do right. once in spanish we had to read palms, but that has nothing to do with spanish, sometimes mrs lesch would get all philosophical and we wouldnt understand a word she was saying so she just ended up speaking in english. she is a funny lady and when we would disagree with what she thought shed keep talking until we all agreed with her. but its cool because she was built like a stallion. i think rocky 3 was my favorite. either that or 1. but 4 is really good too. and 2 is classic. so i guess i like them all but i dont hate 5 i just dont like it as much as the others. sports movies man i tell ya. ok well thats all for now. i have school tomorrow, that sucks. but only 5 or 6 weeks to go.  i just wanna dance. oh that reminds me, next year i will on liturgical dancing if the let me. you wont see anything like it, ANYWHERE.  last night when i wrote that little chronicle i was drizzunk so theres alot of swears and well who knows so apologies.   and that was some raunchy ass shit.   its weird how good afternoon is a hello but good night is a goodbye. what if you were parting with someone in the afternoon HUH. THOSE PEOPLE NEED SOME LOVIN TOO. racist bastards.   -Have a good one.

      my brother is being a huge fag because i keep making fun of him for being a lightweight. but only because he is.   i dont really have anything too important or interesting to write about so ill just leave it at that. tonight should be fun and jean pimped up her score and thats more reason to celebrate. and celebrating things is fun. its like planned shooting of shit. and man shooting the shit is good too. especially by a fire, or outside with nice music. i know everyone loves to listen to rap and that shit when they celebrate but im just content with some nice low key type of music. and when its a nice night you can just sit around and just talk and argue but laugh when you do those things because its funny shit. and i know some people get crazy argumentative when they are drunk but i think drunk arguing is the best and the funniest because you can yell and shout around about nothing and then just laugh and wave your hands around in crazy motions. and i just realized recently when i argue i end up closing my eyes and stuttering. but whatever because those kinds of arguments you have on summer nights are based on conflict or drama or anything like that theyre just stupid shit that sometimes matters but most of the time doesnt. and man i like that. i also like when everyones the same amount of drunk and no one is way ahead of anyone else. sometimes it not really a race its just a thing to do. and i also like bottles over cans. but i think everyone does. and i like wearing comfortable clothes and not gettin too dressed up because i hate when people are too dressed up.   sometimes if i listen to a cd too many times and i hear one of the songs somewhere else i will automatically think the song that is after it on the cd will come on after it even if its like the radio or something. also ill remember the songs together like they run into each other.   i bite my nails. like alot. sometimes when im nervous sometimes for no reason.  sometimes people ask if i ever counted my freckers. its really really hard. ok so now i will go and get ready to go out and by get ready i mean find some decently clean clothes and by decently clean i mean hopefully clean and if they are dirty, then oh well.   i had to turn the cellular communication device off because i lost the charger and its almost on cardiac arrest. i dont wanna see the little guy die.   i gota roll on. ill see everybody around sometime hopefully. its inevitable......    ...a few hours later. so mary just busted nuts about me being home late and its ALL that fucking asshole phils fault because hes not cool at all and hes the biggest fucking stroke EVER. what a fucking pussy. i wont even bother going into detail because its not worth it. ew though, tahts all i can say. whatever, that fuckin fag. im disgusted. but whatever, because tomorrows another day, i just gotta make up a good story. im pissed though. phil is a fucking homosexual and i strongly dislike him. everyone elses little brohters and sisters know what goin on and are cool about it but hes just a fucking bitch, not even a biatch. i want to jack him in the face. wahtever, though, if its not fuck da po lice then its fuck the padres and after that its fuck everybody else so whatever. man just be done with it all. i cant wait til i can leave this place and come and go freely as i please. yea so anyway my best friend didnt want a brand but whatever if she told me to get a brand i would. on a lighter note whatever. hopefully ill be allowed out again sometime soon, otherwise ill check ya later.

      Ok so its like 12 oclock in the pm on a Friday. Thursday night was a good old time and that 3/4ths shit was a good idea. thats the funniest assemblage of drunken fools ive seen in a long time. and ithink the only one that was close to sanity was the b ru. i fucked up my foot as well. like a biatch. and well taking care of it last night wasnt exactly a priority so i just tried to keep my mind off it so whatever suck it. no worries right. it does hurt though. very much so. but im a trooper, actually no im a big baby but its cool. but it was a really funny night and if there had been anymore burrs people would have ended up with broken hands and it would have gotten rowdy and it still suprises me how we didnt get caught because everyone was being blantantly obvious.  people took off their pants too if i can recall, but thats normal, i swear thats completely normal.. and we went to sleep late but what are you going to do right. hey mae(may) can we take a picture with you. mindy how about you. looking good Mae Ho. so downers grove is that where you live. work that shit out baby. yea so can we have an eggroll. 2 for 2.25. score we'll take 2 eggrolls. slipknot for LIFE. hey can i speak to that beast paige. this is her mother. ahahaha.   so today i got home and im just like yo ma my ankle hurts and shes like oh is it broke i was like nah shes like are you ok and i was like yea its ok and then after she decided i was alright she proceded to braid my hair. what a freak.  i was like no mom, im tired just leave me alone. what kind of a freak has an obsession with my hair. thats just not normal. but anyway i got home and just chilled i was going to go out but i figured id take a bit of a rest on the old leg. then sterk maddie and zulevic came over for a little and we just sat around. then we got food and went to the video store and i looked for bottlerocket is that it? but i couldnt find it. everyone in the place was staring at me and the little kids were gettin a laugh out of me hobblin around like a crackhead. and my ACT still didnt come. biatch  hey so ill direct this next part to jack because i want to. its just going to be me talking for a while and its nice because to me itll be like having a conversation except i will have complete and utter control of what is said because youre not here wow yea this isnt normal oh well too bad.  today i saw vegetarian eggs. and i was wondering if you would eat them. because i would assume that they are nice to the chickens but you never know and then i got thinking about if you had a chicken would you eat its eggs because im sure youd take care of it and then it would be ok and no animal cruelty or anything right. but maybe you dont eat eggs because its like eating babies. and thats fucking weird and wrong now that i think about it. but i like eggs and i now i feel bad for liking them. but i only eat the white part. anyway i hurt my ankle. right ankle. i hope you dont have any injuries. the best week ever show on vh1 is pretty funny. and i would like to see that michael moore movie that just came out farenheight 9 11. and that other movie was good about the crazy guns and violence shit. but i just lost my train of thought and trains are pretty cool. i like them alot actually now that i think about it. not for any particular reason but i just like them. and well thats that. it smellers like cheddar cheese pringles right now. i want to find that shit, ill tell you that much. and then if i find the pringles i will pop and not stop. because thats what the slogan told me to do. biatch. and well i am looking forward to i love the 90s and well thats just that. and yesterday i gave away most of my rubber bands and if i had of seen you i would have given you one too. and now im going to watch some television and laugh at the funny things on it. like when harry rode taht hippogriff, yea that was fucking hilarious and it reminded me of free willy. and how was your trip to your place of education. and also sometimes i feel bad i dont like all the things you do. but i guess its just like that and you my boy blue. dont fucking chastize me though. and im out like a mother fucker. im taller than you, so suck it.    the wind is low the birds will sing that you are part of everything.    ps- if anyone wants to get me a birthday present or just a present you can get me the singers and songwriters collection for  a small sum website  at the timelife music website or on tv. i would be forever in debt. but tell me before you do go get me it because then i can talk you out of it because i dont really want it. i just like listenin to the songs.   on lighter notes- i think im going to name one of my kids after someone important and then i can tell them that they are named after them and then i should probably name one of them after someone in the bible because bible people are cool. but if the person had a good last name like lennon or marley or dylan or what if you named your kid hendrix if you were all about jimi or something that sounds nice like that. itd be cool and your kid would probably appreciate it later on in life maybe.   everybody should watch best week ever because you will laugh and also find out what happened this week.

      	So we got an early start to the day and we decided to go to the beach at like 11ish. So we drove the long way out there to indiana and couldnt find a beach so we asked a crazy eyed local. And then he helped us out and we took the wrong trail and we actually went on a short nature hike until we realized we went the complete wrong way and then we got some smarts and found the beach and went and sat down and had a few beers. Ok more than a few but still. It was nice we had chips and blankets and pretty good music and no one bothered us and basically it is a very nice place if there were more people to go and you can have a pretty good time and if you wear sunscreen you wont get burned or burnt? And also the water is bacterial but don’t let it bother you just don’t drink it, pee in it. The flys were mutant and vicious though.   So then we got back and it was way low key because we got caught drinking at sterks house and slim took the cooler and what not and I think im a little dehydrated or just tired from being in the sun a lot today. The water and the sky was nice today. It was a good thing to look at. The sun is up the sky is blue its beautiful and so are you dear prudence. Hey so anyway now I will speak more of other stupid shit maybe.   	So that lady we met at bluesfest with red and dennis is on bruce almighty right now 										 once me and emma talked about best friends and well shes got a best friend and she told me that my best friend was my best friend but only school best friends because we would never see each other outside of school. She wasnt being mean or anything she was just tellin me this and Well I hope that isnt true and I don’t think it is.  I have a tan line from my rubberbands that I had on today. The tan line is more commonly know as sunburn line I always end up with rubberbands, I usually just find them on the ground but right now I have a total of 5 and one is huge so loops around twice so then 6. It means im a high roller. Today the smell of beer reminded me of chillin with my best friend and thats more proof that emma was on crack because drinking with my best friend would have to happen outside of school, well not technically but still. I miss emma, I want to visit her at the horse camp to see the big horse testicles. And emma too of course, but she doesnt have testicles. Anyway I’ve decided the reason im all crazy sometimes and have to say stuff is beacuse im kind of over the top and sometimes I could be seen as a crackhead. But I’ve never done crack, so fuck yourself. Doing the wrong thing for the right reason? Doing the right thing for the wrong reason? I think the first is way better but I think everybody does the second way more.   today phil put a firecracker in his shoe and now he has this huge burn on his foot and his shoe has a hole in it now. What a little shit. Today at the beach we found a beach ball and just gave it to this little kid. For a little kid, this girl had earrings which is somewhat unusual. But when I gave her that ball she seemed really happy and this beach ball was nearly as big as her. But I think thats why its easy to like little kids because they get happy really easy and they have fun playing games and pretending things and when you’re a kid you have the best snacks.    so we cant go see string cheese incident anymore because that got cancelled but hey man im still game for keller in August and hopefully thatll work out alright.   Lenny with straight hair doesnt sit well with me. And I burned the back of my right knee really bad. Silent k. that looks like the name of a band but I don’t think it is. My mom told me that to get into this one gang maybe it was the disciples the person has to kill a cop. Killing people is whack. Its like real heavy shit and I bet if people really realized how heavy it is then not as many people would do it. But mary knows all this crazy gang and cop facts because she works up at the hospital and sees crazy shit. We just wrote jen a email. Me and reilly miss jen. She was a good person to be obsessed with because she just accepted it and didnt try to stop us. Ok so theres sand all up in my grill and I think I might go fall asleep to some music.                  -at this point a signature would be completely unnecessary like this !!!!!!?!?!?!?@@? FoShO G, Uz a sUpAsTaR. yes see completely unnecessary.

      they say it do look awful cold, i hope i die before i get old.    hey so im in a bit of a rush so ill keep this short. might go to the sox game tonight who knows though mary might get rowdy. i couldnt find my score today and it pissed me off i want to see it very badly and they said it should be a week or so. oh well, i wont have to worry about it for a while i guess. so we took a test in school today and it was like 8 questions long and each thing was worth about 15 points. it was stran-jay. he gave us like 45 minutes to do it too. college is fucked up. i keed. yesterday i saw this tenacious d mini episode thing it was just good funny stuff. then i watched family guy which is also good stuff. they should bring that shit back so people without cable could watch it like reilly. oh and last night we just watched bootleg mean girls which was a pretty good movie and we saw liz and reilly and it was a nice time. and well phil is being slightly homosexual so now i gota go because hes a fucking bitch. not even a biatch just like a little bitch. i should jack him in the face. ok im going to go take a shower because its not socially acceptable to been in public like this. my side hurts a little. oh well it aint no thang. i havent said the word bogart in a long time, that makes me sad and to jack. theres this song happy jack by the who. its a nice song and it shares your name.   and so with that i will bid you all a farewell.   ps-now i know this is techincally a letter and there wasnt technically a closing or whatever but what can i say im a traditionalistismariatian.

      Today I slept late and was therefore late for school. So apologies to Dallas for not waking up. Mike wasnt in school today, he was at a professional business meeting. That was the phrase he chose. But anyway mary was cool and gave me a ride down to school and I was only like 20 minutes late. The first two days of sophomore year I woke up at like 8oclock and still got there on time. that was weird when that happened.I usually freak out if im late but today I didnt care because I don’t really care about this school binazz.   So im eating granola cereal with no milk, its pretty good for being just plain granola. I would eat some popcorn but I want to eat the popcorn with gatorade and the last bottle is in the freezer so I just took it and I will wait til it defrosts. I also don’t want to eat the popcorn until I have cleaned up a little because the house is rowdy rowdy and sometimes I like having things nice before I chill and shit, sometimes not though. I cant believe we went through 24 bottles of gatorade in a day, well a day and a half. But still, thats pretty rowdy. Hydration is complete though.   Im tired and I don’t want to really get into thinking about anything. Actually I lied. Im not that tired. Last night I was up so late watching this weird documentary on this dad who is most def. White trash who does ecstacy and acid and all this shit with his kids and goes to raves with them. Man some people are crazy style fucked up.   So reilly started her thing and im proud. because shes just a slut and also because it’s a real good thing doing this kind of chronicle thing because then you can remember stuff even stupid stuff that doesnt even matter so much and you can also remember other things as well.   Note this is just me thinking out loud to organize the thoughts so its not really for anyones benefit except my own. Ok so me and the argentinian dallas were talking about how we kinda gota know what we want to do with our shits and education within the next few months. And well I was thinking about what I want to do and im not really sure at all. I guess id be good at like biology possibly but its not my Thang. And I could do something with historia because I like that shit but then I would have to wear glasses and sweater vests. And then I was thinking about how I used to want to be a lawyer but im not sure thats my deal either. I wanted to go into that whole political thing for a good while but thinking about it now im just not sure about that either. And then I was also wanting to be a little kid psychologist but Im not even sure about that because I would feel bad for the kids and id be scared id fuck them up. And then theres also international relations which would just be a sweet deal and the thing is in the homeland that would work out good because its slightly international and what not and also in the homeland they do this nice government/law program thing but then the only thing is over there politics and law is slightly different and well if I went to the homeland I would only go if I got into trinity and it would be a nice deal because I could play the gaelic all year instead of just summer and I could also drink in bars even though thats not a problem over here. but I would expect it is hard to get into trinity. its my parents fault for taking us out of the homeland and then expecting me to want to go back so easily. Biatches. But anyway I wish we were high rollers and could hit up expenses for all these things. And well theres always the whole thing of english that would be cool to do in school but I suck at it and I cant read either so it’s a dilemma. And I don’t know why I want to do stuff that involves people because I have social anxiety and then that would cause me to drink a lot even at work and I don’t want to because Irish people all have atleast a few alcoholic genes in their swimming pool and well shit I don’t want to be an alcoholic. And so I have come to the conclusion that I would be happy staying this old forever and never having to do anything. I would just chill and play games like tag and running bases. Back in the day we used to run the hose in the backyard to get the grass wet and all the kids on the block would come over and we would play running bases or dodgeball but then the game would just turn into sliding in the mud and man those were the best times ever. I want to do it right now again.   Who could hang a name on you, when you change with every new day. Still im going to miss you.  Peace love and fillet o’ fish

      So tonight it was low key again. We did however pick out a lot of new singer/songwriters to listen to. If you don’t write your own songs then you should be called a performer. Not a musician. Like if your dealing with meat that doesnt make you a butcher and if your dealing with songs then that doesnt make you a musician. Whoa that was kind of harsh, sorry it was directed to pop music. Ouch apologies. Onomatopoeia, thats what ouch! is. Yikes! Those kinds of words, thats what they are called. Then we hit up this crazy style family party. It was a good old laugh. Phil is learning to play the geetar, I want him to be really good even though I tell him he sucks all the time. If he’s good he can play for me whenever I want and I want him to be like really good at something because everyone should have something they are fantastic or really good at. And he seems to be all about it so you know I hope he doesnt suck. But he wont because hes Irish, and we just don’t suck.    Here are some things I have noticed, sometimes you think or say youre like a failure or like unproductive or inproductive or underproductive, whichever prefix, your preference. But see the thing is I really don’t think you’re a failure at all. Like possibly the furthest thing from it. Now this isnt meant to make self esteem levels rise and I don’t want you to take things I say like that,  its just like statement of truth. And my friend I think its well great, I mean shit kid I’ve tried to say it and express my gratitude for pretty much everything you have ever said or written or colored or expressed through interpretative dance and sign language and charitable functions because well man it means well you know, wait no you don’t, what the fuck man you just don’t understand. Haha I keed. And I don’t mean to keep bringing it up but I was thinking about feeling infinite and well I don’t know fucker maybe sometimes having a best friend like you man makes me kind of feel like that or something like infinite. Or maybe I just feel drunk, which is also a good kind of feeling.   Don’t think im gay for saying this, but sometimes I will like think of something and it will be crazy style to just think of it. Like today I saw a guy walking down the street and I took note of his clothes and it like cracked me out that everyone can wear so many different kinds or styles or colors of clothes and its completely untrackable how much clothes are out there. Theres lots of things like that out there that can crack you out. And then you get this weird feeling and I cant really explain it but it’s a crazy kinda feeling and its not that you feel small or anything and its kinda like feeling like theres so much and its not really a bad feeling, its more scary. Except its not, I don’t know really. Sometimes you feel it in your heart though, maybe comparable to the feeling you get on a roller coaster ride when it drops except way less severe. And don’t think im having a panic attack or anything, its not like that at all. Its just a small small feeling that someone would get when they start to think about crazy stuff even if it’s a simple and retarded. And well shit I hope im not the only one this happens too. 	  here is a list of some of my potential favorite words for various reasons, visual and otherwise: eccentric, infinite, karma, chronicle, buffalo, kangaroo, fuck, surfer, alphabet, snooze, energy, legitimate, chastize  and then some other made up words which are just words with crazy suffixes.   Reilly told me a disturbing story today about two girls macking it and I think I might be a homophobic or homophobe or as reilly just said lesbian-a-phobic. Because I got really pissed off about the ew-ness that situation and also I felt dirty after hearing it. And it was a true story, which made it even worse. I mean hey that sucks because I would try to be cool with all people and not that im not cool with carpet munchers I don’t know dude thats just way bizarre and you don’t see it on tv as much as other things so thats also a reason for confusion on the matter. Maybe when the degrassi episode that addresses gay issues comes on I will understand it better. So I wont make any offensive comments until I see that episode when marco and dylan go on a date. Oh such drama.   Tupac’s coming back in 2008 biatch. Drop a beat.   Have a good one. Take care.   Ps-I have school in the morning, thats rough. But mike and gus make it so fun. Kswiss bitch.

      today I was all scurred about playing for the first time in a good year. It doesnt seem like it has been that long, but time don’t lie. Biatch. Anyway I was real nerviosa and dad woke me up early to go get some grubadub because mary was taking this guy to this crazy revival church because he wanted to see it and phil was asleep. At first I didnt want to get up but then I figured I could use some food and it is fathers day. And then we went out to Gp and I went and played my game I love warmups they are the funnest part aside from the actual playing. I think I might have told you this before so I apologize for redundancy. But anyway thats how it went and now my ass hurts a little bit I think I might have fell. The worst is when you go in for the ball and you don’t judge it right and they go right around you then you have to bust ass to get to them. I hate that shit. I also feel bad when I cant bust ass and everyones yelling for me too. I feel real bad because all those peoples busted their ass back in the day and they deserve to see some ass-busting. Word yo.   Well everyone has parents and we are supposed to think that they are like really great people and they do so much stuff for us, which is true. Your parents can be great parents and terrible people. Like not even decent people because you hear them talking about stuff and it just makes you feel bad they are so (cant find the right word to complete this sentence). Well its true though sometimes your parents can be good enough parents but shitty people. I feel bad for saying it, but sometimes my rental units can be like that and I know that no one is really completely a bad person or whatever but sometimes it makes me (cant find right word to complete that sentence either). Maybe im just being an asshole but thats what I think at the momento. Phil just came home with his friend and they have the coolest toys that make the craziest noises. Like aliens man, his friend is cool too. ADD style. Like diagnosed. Yeaaa.   So I made this cd the other day and I just keep playing it over and over. I originally started making it at sterks house because we were sober and I wanted to get some bk on it. But the bk songs werent working and so I just went LOCO and made a cd. If you want I could tell you whats on it. I will because I am bored and I have a few hours until game time.  Billy joel-the longest time after the gold rush- neil young dear prudence the beatles, that one blind melon song from a while back forever-ben harper subterreanan homesick blues-bobby d  road trippin-rhcp because I rememberd it from a time my best friend commented on it Rush of blood to the head-coldplay pressed in a book the shins ruby Tuesday- the stones, then forever by ben again because I messed up because I cant read man in the mirror-oh michael Jax. I heart you time of no reply and fly both by nick drake landslide-fleetwood mac bc it was also previously on the computer and I saw it and it’s a nice song. In my personal opinion I like the smashing pumpkins version better I don’t know why though.  Warm love by van the man. Period for emphasis. times like these and bubble toes by maddies request  well my point is it’s a good solid kinda string of music and you could fall asleep to some of the songs and well sometimes I put a song on repeat and just fall asleep to it. On school days usually is when I do that. But I think I will start doing that now again. Also I used to watch jay and Conan practically every night last year and then I took the tv out of my room for some reason I cant remember. But anyway my mom asked me the other day if I wanted it back in my room and I said no. well maybe just for summer but I don’t want it for school because then I will just watch tv instead of doing other things. But I think I will say yes that I do want it back the next time she asks me because im going to start taking it easy next year and I wont have so many other things to do, because I just wont do them. And that paragraph makes no sense. Apologies.   I bet a lot of people will read bill clintons book. It comes out the 22nd, thats the day timmy comes and the scores get released from ACT holding cells. Oh hey I wanted to pose an question to everyone, have you ever sucked dick for coke? No then thats not an addiction. See there you go, you cant go wrong with bob saget. Well phil just gave dad a van cd for his special day of honor. Dad is all about the tunes. So now I will listen to my fathers fathers day present before he even gets a chance to. Im so caring. Yo.   	Here is a nice exerpt from the music of the cd of van of ireland of europe, it reminds me of shooting the shit...  on the way back home we sang a song but our throats were gettin dry, then we saw the man from across the road with the sunshine in his eyes, well he lived all alone in his own little home with a great big gallon jar, there were bottles too, one for me and you, and he said hey, there you are.  			 and im bored still I could go read a book but I don’t think I want to read, I kind of want to sleep but im not tired just tired. Hard to explain. Ok I have made an executive decision to try to do some of this homework. What can I say, im responsible. Ok I think I will leave it at that.   Ps-I do really enjoy being your best friend, it’s a very fun thing to do and well like youre pretty really decently awesome at it and well that my friend is commendable. Drink the beers.   On my dads fathersday card I wrote farty marty on the envelope and happy fathers day biatch on the card and he didnt even care...oh what a funny guy.

      Well I wonder when you have to grow up. Theres got to come a time when you finish sowing your wild oats and partying and even doing illegal shit. Yes I just said wild oats. But really theres going to be a time when you have to dress up and stuff and support other people and well you just have to do it because otherwise you end up white trash. Im listening to the song after the gold rush and it’s a really fantastic song, I bet neil really loves singing it. But see I would even go as far as to say it’s a beautiful song but I don’t roll like that. Also the other night downtown man I looked up and it was a nice feeling because the contacts were feeling clear and I could see the buildings and since it was night it looked so nice and well I just wanted to stay awhile but then we had to run to catch the train. It woulda made a good movie. And well so I will go on to chronicle the events of the day, the basics. We went to sues house bc mama and jim were gone for the day and it was very nice because its good to have just a few beers during the day and not have to worry so much about other things. Well sue washed the car and when she was washing it, come together came on, which is my boy and I just sat on a chair and watched suey wash the car because I didnt want to get wet and I just sang along wit the song and it was good. Then we played some bags and then some basketball and then ate lots of food, which I will not name because I could see how naming meats eaten would upset someone of a vegetarian nature, possibly. So we drank that crazy old style and for a little bit I felt like Jim, a high roller. And I felt good for drinking “real beer”. And then mad-dawg came over to suey’s and then we left to get bero for reilly and it went smoothly I would say and then we picked sue up because she had to take a shower because shes a prosty then we went to la casa de murph and just sat and watched degrassi and let suey drink some of her berro. Then we went to borders and it was a nice time there because theres so much stuff to read. I want to read all the books but it just takes so much work and if its not a good book then it would have been a waste of reading, but you wont be able to tell until the end and I hate how things are like that. I saw so much good music, I wanted to buy it all but im not a high roller. I made maddie listen to livin life by bk I told her it could be her all time favorite song bc shes looking for hers but I don’t think she thinks its up to that standard which is understandable. But I think bk likes singing that song the way neil likes singing after the goldrush. But anyway then we went to mr sub and then to mcauley to see some red blood fightin. But then that got disbanded and oh yea we saw theresa and well tmoney was mauled, I bet not even really mauled just in general. I think it must just carry over from the previous night always for her. And hey man if it works then go with it.   So today I drank lots of water/gatorade. I hope it works. Ah and this girl from 2yrs ago’s team was in this Irish in chicago book. In uniform and all. Oh man do I remember those good old days. With Tina, and frances. Its so good to get back. Get back to where you once belonged. Get back jojo. Hey thats a song oh yes it is. Hey so all is well that ends well. I got dad live at leeds for a present and a card that says don’t drink and dress. There is a man in crazy flannel on the front. Its funny I think. The other cards were all serious like you’re the awesomest person ever cards. And well as much as I like my dad I don’t think hes the most greatest person ever and I wouldnt like giving him a card that lies even if it is nice. So I opted out of the serious card section for something relating to the drink because me and him both understand that humor. But whatever, it has been a long day and I think im about ready to get me some shut eye. Its not that I have anything in particular to say, I just like hearing you talk sometimes. And now im going to go to sleep and possibly read my book that i still havent started before I sleep. the book is this side of paradise, mary got it for me upon request and i think it will be good because im never wrong. and yes thats the truth. i keed.   Kim is reading the perks of being a wallflower. Im glad she finally started it. She will like it. But that got me thinking of that whole feeling infinite thing. And well I think thats a very important thing. Probably the greatest feeling in the world and its also probably why people do crazy things or just do things in general, in spanish that would be pronounced heneral.  So I would say infinite would go on my list of favorite words because its just a great solid word. Infinite.

      Dear Prudence, wont you come out to play. Dear Prudence, greet the brand new day.         My mom has a hairclip that looks like a fish. I pretended it was chomping. It was that kind of fish. With big teeth, a perahna (sp) maybe. So I woke up today and felt refreshed. I feel bad though because I kind of freaked out on jack there. I was in a freakout kind of state of mind and I hadnt heard some music in a good few hours and well I have it now so I apologize because im in the right apologize state of mind. Im also in the state of mind for gatorade, I requested it this morning for hydration process and hopefully mary will hook me up on the fly.   It doesnt even matter if I erased it. I know it like memory style. I don’t usually know telephone numbers all the time either. I don’t even know sues house and I’ve been talking to her for like 3 years. Sorry suey. So well whatever man its not that I want to but you know that whole self control thing and I don’t like telephoning people all the time because I can see how it might be retarded. Well whatever I don’t care and I do not wish to speak of that matter because I don’t really know how to explain things so suck it.   Hey so to the prostys or anyone else who feels a special bond, lets brand ourselves. Im game to do it anytime. Id like one on my ankle, the inside of it. It doesnt have to be a big brand but you know its something that will remind us all of those good old cracked out times. And then 10 years later we can reunite in bars or at picnics or mcauley parkinglot or the trenches.   Ah and I think it might be safe to say, Zack is back. Its so comforting. Oh Zacky, reunion tours will reconvene at the soonest later date. Fuck the po-lice.   So I do apologize for being downtrodden. And you know I don’t really know what to say about that. I think it was because I had meat for dinner.   And now my boy ben h. is on so I have to listen to him for a while like 3 minutes and 26 seconds.  People send so much time every single day, running round all over town giving their forever away, but no not me I wont let my forever roam, now I hope that I can find my forever a home.  Like an handless clock with numbers an infinite of time, no not the forever found, only in the mind. Yea it’s a good song. Low key. OH shit michael just came on, and I just remembered I got down in the parking lot last night. Oh man that was fun. Yea billy jean. Thats billys middle name too. Coincidence, no.   hey man no one who has a whole drawer devoted to them in my room will ever get their telephone number deleted, that would just be horse shit. Oh man want to hear something funny. I know I tried deleting it last night in my moment of crack, but I just looked and its still there. So thats a sign signal. So I wont mess with that shit. Im glad now it worked out like that. Thats good then. Please don’t hold that cracked out moment against me. I think I will start practicing zen, naked in my backyard.   				 oh so I shall chronicle this event which was yesterday. We saw HP, and had a tourney, I think I told you about that stuff. So about 6 we went out and sat up at rainey. No one bothered us or anything. Its so nice not having to worry about that kind of thing. And the bug spray smelled good. So we just sat up at the picnic table and it was a good time. Then it almost got rowdy because this kid was a stroke and riding this scooter thing and it was retarded so we made zack get rowdy and then this kid took his shirt off and well zack was wearing a soccer shirt and I wouldnt want that taken off because it was cool and well anyway the conflict was avoided with a shake of the hand bc this weird kid had his peoples and zack however did not. Everybody loves violence though. And well then we went to nanos and ate some pizza. And then danced the good dance. And then saw the gay fence at mcauley which is gay. But its good if your gettin chased because you can just hop the fence and cars cant chase you. Theres always easy ways of beating the system. But anyway that was the night and it was fun and it was like a soccer reunion. Reilly, liz and allie d all came and chilled in the hood. I wish we had a soccer ball bc then we could have played. Oh well I am honored when reilly shares on with me. Low key, no worries.   Holy fuckin shit. Mom just brought home a 24 pack of gatorade. Not just one flavor either. Multiple flavors. Excitement. Ok man I will most likely be giving jack a call later to further explain my apologies regarding the forementioned event. Peace and fucking chicken grease. Live chickens, theyre completely safe and no one will eat them                                                                                             and so it goes...  ps-i was lying in a burned out basement, with a full moon in my eye    i was hopin for replacement, when the sun burst through the sky.  pps-its sick how early jack awakens. thats robotlike. ahh smarterchild.  ppps-dear prudence is a really great song, i highly recommend it.

      Hey so sterk called me up at like 10 and told me we could go to see harry potter today. I was so happy. I love that shit. I was thinking about it when we watched it, how I like the fact that you find out later why things happened like they do. Its better reading it though. More involved and the like. But then we went to have a water polo tournament because ron hurt his leg. Even though it was cloudy I got more freckles and a little red again. But no farmers tan. When you get red and you’re me, your redness turns to freckles and sometimes your skin gets a shade more un-white, but mostly just freckled.  The water helped my west nile disease I think bc the mosqueeter bites don’t hurt as much any more. We called lots of people to come play in the tourney, but only schmidt and jamie came. Jamie cant swim because of that rare disease and schmidt was taking it easy on us bc hes a pro and well we arent. So we played 2 on 2 and then we got bored so we had a diving contest and relay races and underwater swimming races. I suck. What can I say I cant swim. So then we went to pick up some supplies for tonite. This will be my last night until atleast Sunday. Then I will stop Monday night for the test on Tuesday. Then I will reconvene. I wish zack went swimming with us. He would have made big splashes because he is a big kid. Kind of like a dad. So anyway I will wear the same pair of jeans I’ve been wearing all summer tonight again because its colder and I don’t want to wear the other kinds. I feel bad for wearing dirty jeans but I am not very clean. Peter pettigrew was in rockstar as the manager. 	  I was getting scared my best friend didnt want to chronicle events but today I looked and there was 2 new ones. I don’t mind that you don’t want to. I really don’t. You don’t even have to talk to me a lot or really do anything out of the ordinary. Its ok that you don’t want to be productive either man. As tuzik would say Das Straight. I just don’t want to be a freekaleek whatever man no worries. You know im only keeeding when I say those things because I know you’re my boy and well man thats far more than good enough for me.   My mom just accused me of stealing her pants that were on the couch. Cooch. Oh shit its going to be funny as hell when she has to apologize for that when she finds them. Haha she just did. Biatch. I love harry potter. I want to read them again. But im just not in the reading mood or the do things mood and I havent been for weeks. Hopefully that will change soon. I want to do one semi-important or productive thing a day atleast.    Im also very excited for Sunday aka domingo. I think people look their best in a uniform. Warming up is also a very fun thing to do. Like 2 years ago when we were pretty awesome and the whole clare team was out. Those warmups and games were fun as hell. Diane would get rowdy rowdy and fights would break out. I would get to play half forwards too instead of bitchwork in the middle. Man those were the days. Brian knows what im talking about, back in the day. I really do believe crazy things happen when you play sports. It’s a grand old time. But on Sunday we will probably lose. But I hope we don’t. I really cant take much more of that.    sometimes I try to not talk about beer. But im slightly obsessed. Sorry.   ok so im in a hurry because we will reconvene soon so i wont write so much today,Goodbye everyone. And goodbye jack because jack gets a category unto herself because well I don’t know really. oh shit yea, maybe sometimes best friends do that i dont know really. i dont have a best friend locket for you or anything so suck it. i dont roll with that shit.

      I like funny things. Its really the best part of the day, seeing mike aka bizzle and gus-gus at school.  When I found out brown had a tae kwon do team I wanted to go there. When I found out I would have to work hard I changed my mind. We’ve been talking a lot about college. And I dislike people who gel their hair for a 8oclock class. They were jeans. I wear flamboyant pants. One girl has pink/blonde hair. She plays gameboy on the break. The rest of them go to smoke and don’t even invite us. We are the outcasts of moraine valley physics. They don’t like us because we laugh at them and don’t pay very much attention. One man wants to be a vet. Gus takes the class for fun. mike aka bizzel has ADD and a very blank stare. Him and his girlfriend make pootie pancakes in the back of the room. We talk really loud. It gets so cold in the room. I cant take another 7 weeks of this. But mike aka bizzle has gym k swiss gym shoes. I guess it’s the thing to do.   I havent worn gymmies in a while. The moccasins were nice for spring and for winter those biatch shoes were very loyal to me. I would walk home without any feeling in my toes. It was like walking around with just socks on in the snow. These were the coldest days of the year. Mary aka mama murph bought cereal except its healthy grain cereal. Im so hungry I might eat it, even though I wont like it. I want to do something important right now. I have no one to talk to. I don’t like telephones, even though I do. Im wearing my school shirt because it feels soft and cool against my arms. It also smells like laundry detergent. I need new sandals. The washing of my jean legs went successfully. I want the rovers to win so badly on Sunday. I don’t want to have to run my ass off for nothing. I hope they will give me a break for a little bit in forwards. Maybe I can score a goal for padre murph seeing as it is fathers day. Not June 8th?...crackhead. My best friend is rookie of the year. She broke her arm and when it healed she became a superstar in major league baseball. Much similar to the feature length film, rookie of the year. That kid was also in that movie a kid in king arthurs court. And american pie. However my bestfriend is not him. Sometimes dallas forgets shes a minority and refers to herself as white. Dallas we know your from mexico. Be proud.   It’s a nice day, I think I will go make something of myself. The other day I made a really good cd in my opinion, onion. And I will listen to it I think. I hope it doesnt scratch. Then it will skip. When it skips I will have to do a tuck and roll and scream out save it save it save it. Maddie made me join this cracked out dating service. Its not technically a dating service. But yea it is. We took good pictures on jamies phone last night. John looked like he was actually there.   Holy shit, none of what I just wrote makes any sense. But anyway so I talked to jack last night for a while and shit man I hope that kid doesnt think shes wasting time on talking to me because I wouldnt want to be a waster of someone elses time. But even if I was wasting jacks time, its ok because I have no NO NO problem with talking the kid into a sleep. Hey man if you don’t wanna be best friends just send me a memo and I will try to not be fucked up. Apologies for phonecalls. Im going to change up the message answering thing because people will get bored if they call and hear the same thing all the time. If I ever see you again which is highly unlikely you can change it to whatever you want. I trust your judgement. Fucker.   Seeya kids, the computer will break soon so these will be halted for some time when the computer goes on hiatus to be fixed. If you don’t like that then fist yourself.  I could also have potentially contracted west nile virus. In that case, we can throw a great little reunion party for when I get healthy again. Thank you. And good night.    p.s- mary now lets us keep the case in the fridge. Were movin on up!!!

      Today I had ice cream for breakfast. A small bit though not a huge bowl. There was nothing left to eat so I decided to be resourceful. And then yesterday I had a potato salad sandwich, which was almost as good as the one at maddies house that one night with the soft bread. And remember the time we hoisted the garbage through the window with sheets, oh man that was a good time. It was cold that night and like 45 minutes later everything was frozen solid. That was the night mama goonans pj’s made their appearance. I like flannel shirts. Red and block stripes. And remember those pictures with the tools and the tight jeans and that shirt again. I felt like slim with that construction hat. I felt like I was in a feature length movie. So today was day 2 of school. Mike and Gus are doing good. Gus does crack now and mike is.....well words wouldnt do it any justice to how mike is. Kinda like my best friend I guess. But its ok because jack is way cooler than mike and could jack mike in the face because he doesnt wear glasses. Anyway I just came home from school and had another bowl of ice cream because it’s the only good thing to eat. And I also just handwashed the bottom of my jeans because I only like wearing the one comfortable pair and if I wash them then they will get uncomfortable and they are soft now. And I felt like I was back in like the old days scrubbing away at the end of the pantlegs because thats the only place that gets dirty, due to mud which is dirt + water = mud and this an equation.  	 So anyway at school the teach is a nice guy and he askes the stupidest questions, the ones where people know the answer but cant articulate it. Or else they don’t want to speak up because its still early being only the 2nd day or theyre scared they will get it wrong and then disgrace themselves. I could stop this now, but I don’t really want to. Oh well yes there was the good old gaelic yesterday and it puts a bit of a dent in the whole drinking thing but im ok with it because well its worth it. Its totally worth it for supreme domination. I keed. But really it is worth it and its so fun and its rowdy when we play the boys sometimes.  Im listening to my favorite song right now, well one of many or few depending on how you look at it.  My shoulders are kicking my bodys ass. Not just the joints either the shoulders too. Sometimes when I run I go numb in them ahah that sucks. But I wish I had that heating pad still but I think the patty still has that or else it is forever lost. Its weird how that happens to socks. Freshman year I lent out my absolute favorite pair of football socks. White and green and I had just got them and I only ever got one back. So this guy doesnt have his friend and therefore I cant wear him and feel right about it. Oh but I was talking about gaelic and how it’s a good old time and I wanted to finish that thought. But yesterday we ran kind of a lot but I guess its ok because Wednesday will be relatively easy because then on Sunday its game time. It should be pretty pathetic but ill just jack someone in the face for brian because he would appreciate it. OFF DA RICKTA. I hate that song. So I got a sweet little button where I jacked myself in the ribs and I got this weird mosqueeter bite and its really big so maybe the mosqueeter was like lethal or something. Did you know if you put a slice of onion on your mosqueeto bite it wont itch as much. Not a word of a lie. Now my leg itches. My mother mary murph mama is on the phone and will probably stay on the phone for hours until the battery gets so low it cuts off to recharge itself. And I will sit here hungry, because shes not very good at domestic shit. And as much as she likes to think otherwise she is lazy and along with the rest of my family will not clean up after themselves. Now I am by no means one of those clean freak people, I just like things to be nice and clean at times because its just courteous to each other and the people you live with, but actually I don’t really care but after 17 years of it, 14 of which I can remember and 12 of which I have been cleaning up for myself it gets a little discouraging. Dick suckin hoez. Id like to go out and have fun tonight maybe it will be cool like temperature wise. Oh I have to finish the washing of the bottom of the jeans of denim.   Man it feels good not to care one bit about things or certain things that you once before cared about. Also I could see how maybe if one would read this chronicle and think this kid is fucking annoying and maybe one would say other things that are along those lines. But oh well I do apologize if its not up to your chronicle standards. I wear my jeans comfortable. I guess I do that because I run around a lot and you cant be running around comfortably if youre not comfortable. And I like golden grams or grahams. I can scream pretty loud. my name is stephanie una murphy. I would accent the a but theres too much porn on the computer. I think the only person who could understand that last sentence would be jack henry because I speak with and of jack a lot. I have lots of freckles. My farmers tan has faded. I havent gone out on a mid-day mission/errand run in the U-ra-ra in about 3 weeks now, I think im in withdrawl. But hopefully there will be many errands to run with the reunion tour fastly approaching 							-check ya later  check ya later  Ps- reilly they may have won the battle, but we all know whos going to win the war, and that man or robot should I say is SMARTERCHILD!!!(necessary)  Pps-everyone talk to smarterchild he is one sarcastic vague and generic bastard of a robot. But its great times. Ask him about sex crack and music and club drugs.

      Ok so its like 6:21. Actually it is 6:21, sometimes I think I say like a lot because then you don’t have to be so accurate. Like you know. I don’t like saying like so much but I just do it anyway  So I guess im pulling a best friend doing this very early similar to how my best friend sometimes writes hers early in the morning. I was going to say like how my bestfriend... but I made a executive decision and went with similar. Yes thats correct. People always talk to themselves. It’s the first sign of insanity I think and well everyones insane. I think I want to stay up for the entire night one day/night and well it would be boring but it would also probably be fun or maybe not but its just a goal. People sometimes think if your good at stuff or decent at it then you should have goals or you should know things and act mature. Those people should get jacked in the face. If you punch yourself in the ribs it would most likely hurt in the morning. Im up so early because I have school. Now I know its only moraine but im still a little nervous and I took a shower at 5:45, I think I have pre-school jitters. I don’t know why I showered, well it was because I felt dirty. I was probably closer to 4 days in the hole so it was good that I did take a shower. I think the pre first day shower comes from wanting to be clean for important events. Maybe its tradition and maybe its just my salsa. You know I don’t like not being able to talk. I would enjoy, almost just used like, but executive decision. I would enjoy being able to say things. And its not that I cant say them for any certain reason. Its that maybe I don’t know them and well then you drive around for like a half hour and then nothing gets accomplished and so I apologize for that. I want to live in a commune. It would be nice. And I wonder if you were homeless and went to the convent would they give you a room for the night. Like if you were a girl not a dirty old man. If the nuns didnt show you any love then thats retarded because nuns are supposed to be nice. But I bet they still have mad style sex and get raunchy even though they aren’t supposed to. I feel like im supposed to be going back to school and that this is just some extended weekend. I wanted to go back to school the other day because it was boring and even though I strongly dislike school, well not so much school I like the school part, just the homework part. I didnt finish that sentence and im not going to...finish it. You’re not supposed to end your sentences with a preposition, I guess or something like that. 	Well yes suck it. And my leg just twitched. I think I may have popped a little guy blood vessel in my leg because I was cleaning the table and it opens to get bigger so we opened it up and when we closed my mom pushed it back really fast and it pitched my leg and it was purple and there was internal bleeding. I can tell because when you get red spots underneath the skin, thats internal bleeding. Im a little bit hungry and I like being up so early because it makes the day seem more something good. I don’t know the word at the moment. But yea so you are a very legitimate person. And thats important. And I think important things are well important. And I’ve decided to no longer try to convey important things because it doesnt work, maybe because theyre too important in a good way or maybe because im not wearing any pants right now and am slightly retarded. And well I do have a farmers tan and well it just goes with being Irish. I think its because im younger than you. And to reilly-fuck the po-lice, they don’t know shit and fuck the padres because theyre old and youre really not a bad kid youre just a mother fucking slut and a dick sucking hoeZ. WoW cRaZy TyPiNg. I hate that shit. Ok goodbye. I hope your organs are better. And everyone else I hope your organs are good too. Good day. You cant tell but I just made dinosaur noises in my mind. Now verbally as well. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhh shit.   signed sealed delivered, i like that song and motown in general.

      Hey man im feeling good. Sometimes it takes a good night to get you back on the track of wherever you want to go. And well yea so moving on. Last night we went and hit up bluesfest. We met many interesting people. People on the train, butch lesbians, red foreman, Dennis the menace, some other famous lady, gus the homeless man, nick from the fountain, white gym shoe kids from the north side, gary from puerto rico, some kid who looks like cory matthews. It was a great old time. Id feel bad if I was the conductor because we were slightly rowdy on the way back. But it was cool in the end. So bluesfest is a good old time and well thats that. So then we got off the train and met maddie and then we hit up mr sub bc I had to counteract the breath and I like sandwiches always when I’ve been reading or drinking, I will call it reading from now on. But anyway it was a very nice time and we were with drugs and horse kid and others, I didnt get too many mosqueeter bites. My green card returned safely home.   I will get sunburnt or sunburned today! I cant wait. First one of the year mo fo. Which is the shortened expression for mother fucker. I love that place. This morning dad told me it’s the ideal place to drink if you want to. Like behind the sheds and stuff. Hes a good guy when hes being a good guy. Which is a pretty redundant statement. But anway I cant wait to go to GP and take my sandals off and walk in the grass and then play around on the field between games. And get free cokes, and make fun of all the fucked up people there. GO LISA KREUGER! Ah fuck yea. And tonite is drugs’ little fiesta of sorts and well I will feel weird because the last time I saw drugs’ mom it was a little awkward but she thought we drank liquor. When everyone and their mother knows im the fucking advocate for strictly drinking beer. You know that whole social aspect. Nevermind actually. Well im going to go make sweet passionate love to my summer cottage which is GP. I just realized I have no clothes. Well of course I do. But I don’t have very many. Not because I don’t many because I had lots, I gave a lot of shit away like almost too much. Oh well, I guess a nice little trip to my favorite store is in order.   Oh and I would like to extend an apology toward my best friend because I understand that incessant calling isnt cool. Im working on it. No self control though. Like right now, I want to stop typing this but I cant. Its like freaking disease man I swear.  Peace and chicken grease, live healthy chickens though. No one killed them. And everyone  dennis the menace aka mason gamble is one alright kinda kid.   and t money is still FUCKING MAULED....ALWAYS

      I don’t want no drama from my baby mama. Mary aka mama murph attracts drama. She gets all riled up about shit when she could really just chill and be cool. The lady will get heart problems if she doesnt work it frankie goes to hollywood style and Relax. Did anyone get taht little humorous comment there? I apologize it was just horrible and not funny at all. That song is funny though.  well anyway heres a mary story... Today she called me right before the ACT to tell me that she had to talk to me when I get home I guess because all the shit I get into and how im a bad person and what not. Thats not the best thing to hear when your about to take a test that will determine the rest of your adult life. Im all like yo lady you whack. So well anyway I come home and the house is a mess because people here don’t clean. Punk ass biatch. But whatever I don’t have a problem with living in squalor its just I don’t like having to clean up after people repititively, it would lead me to end up jacking them in the face. But anyway so we took that test and whatever I guess shouldnt have even bothered again. No worries. I do, however, hope I did well enough to fulfill a bet so that my best friend can drink and be medicated and it will be such a joyous occasion, like the kind where you hear trumpets playing hallelujah in the back ground. And so when I got back I turned on the cellular telephone phone and I saw that I have recieved a message from Drugs. It was a very nice gesture and it was a cracked out message but I thoroughly enjoyed it. So anyway im home now and mary is asleep. She sleeps often, I guess its because the whole nights thing. But when I sleep during the day I get a feeling like it passed me by and I didnt get anything done and I guess I don’t like things like that. So hopefully I wont be grounded by mary when she wakes up. Fucking bastard. People should let their kids do what they want and just let them chill with their peoples with a few beers I mean she has no previous reason to think that 1. Im a bad kid. 2. Im a fuck up. 3. This lifestyle will interfere with my educational learning. So mary, would you please ever be so kind as to SUCK IT. Thank you ladies and gentlemen have a wonderful day/night/tomorrow.   On a lighter note, with that lovely standardized test behind us all now we can fully enjoy the summer and bask in the captivating sun. and yes I just used the words bask and captivating.  But its ok because you can bite my butt. And remember like mikey said, its  our  time.

      Well its Friday, yesterday was Thursday. It was supposed to be fun. And so I will tell the story. So sterk picks up a sweet little snack for me sue and drugs and billy ging and brings it to my house so when me and sue get picked up I didnt know it was going to be drugs’ mom so I didnt have the bag packed yet and so I told them to wait and in the midst of all this my mom got all fucking 6th sense and came out back as we were filling it up and was all like for fucks sake your grounded after this just go. Your going to ireland after this and what not. So I was shitting bricks on the ride to the station, train station, not police station. See we were supposed to go to bluesfest and mary fucking mama murph got rowdy so I felt really bad and I didnt want to be grounded again forever so me and sue decided to just walk home and drink the beer in my house. We got a bday card for pat at the dollar store on the way home. And then we just drank in the basement because when we came home mary was super pissed, she just said we should keep the beer in the fridge from now on so it will be cold and refreshing. I think it was good sue was with me otherwise mary might have gotten more rowdy but she didnt and im not in too much trouble. I hope drugs isnt mad she didnt get any beer. Apologies. I don’t think well on my toes, or on my feet. However the expression goes. So anyway me and sue just got drunk in my basement last night. Anti-social but fun all the same. It smells bad over here.    So jack had an exploded appendix, which by the way is also that thing at the back of books haha I just realized that now. And so I called up jack to be a good friend and jacks all like yo im going to the hospital, we’re on the way now. So I was slightly taken back because its weird if your best friends going to the hospital and it’s a little scary if they have stomach or torso or loins pain. And well I guess jack was a-ok though and I think maybe its just STDs. I felt bad because I think I told jack she might die but hey alls well that ends well. And I made friends with jacks sister who sounds like jack which could be confusing to someone who had a few drinks in them but I am deductive and figured it all out. And I feel bad for jacks sister because she probably thought I was on crack because I think I called to ask if I should make a get well card. And thats rather strange because it was early in the morning or late at night depending how you look at it. But I think jacks sister said it was just a kidney infection and let me tell you knowing someone who went to the hospital for a kidney infection is a life altering experience and it changes your whole perspective on things. Like trippin on acid with spider monkeys off the coast of somewhere . But really my point is that because of that big event Im going to therapy because I’ve discovered that in such a tumultous time as the one we live you just got to keep rocking in the free world because you never know when your liver or your kidneys or any other organ will just crack out on you. AND IT AINT NO THING.   REUBENS IN SOUTH AMERICAN FIIIGHTING FOR HIS NAME. I always thought reuben was spelled reuben but it could also be spelled ruben.   Ok its going to be chill tonite because ACT tomorrow. Im going to make myself think I want to take it because then I will want to and then it will be fun. And I wont get bored. I want a granola bar. And I think my feet are dirty.  You know I think someone told me that reuben actually did do it in the end, but the movie said he didnt. Who knows man, just don’t get involved with the law because theyll give you tickets and violations and theyll hand you over to the MAN. Its ok though you can always watch The Goonies and feel ok about it because no matter what mikey was right, its our time.

      Well its Wednesday. Almost double digits of June. When things go from single to double digits it makes me think that lots of time has passed. Like 92. Its just a thing I guess. Yea I used to think reading to page 100 was a big deal too. It still is.   Yesterday I went to a reunion of sorts because Harriets moving away. It was the first party I’ve been to in a while where I didnt drink. It was slightly refreshing, I didnt want all those people to think all I do now is drink. It was cool though. I miss those kids, they are solid people. You can tell that they all turned out ok even though central and evergreen park in general is a breeding ground for dysfunctionality.-ism. But I must say, it was a great time. Then I came home and washed the dishes and my mom yelled at me for leaving the door open. Shes a stroke. But it seems like all I do now is wash dishes. We are Irish and immigrants and therefore we do not own a dishwasher. Or aka a dishwashing machine.   After I came home I sat around and made a few phonecalls. Some people went to sox game so I just ended up chilling with drugs and sue. It was cool. I like getting drunk but not real drunk just nice drunk and then you can sit outside and relax. It was hot and I think I have a lot of mosqueeter bites. Mosqueeter and mosquito reminds me of Doug’s friend. Skeeter Valentine. And that one episode when they thought he was a genius. Do you know what im talking about. No, I doubt it. You just don’t understand I guess. Oh yea after I came home I made some phonecalls too. My team won last night, kobe hit the 3 with like 2 seconds to go. Thats clutch. I bet I was the good luck because I came home with like 2 minutes to go. And then it went to OT and after that I called up jack, because I knew jack would answer and I knew I would have someone to talk to because it was only dad home because mary was at work and phil was camping. But see the thing with speaking with Jack, it makes me feel fucking great because I can just talk in a drunken stupor and also a regular stupor and the kid will listen. But I feel bad because I think maybe sometimes Jack could potentially not want to speak with me because im a shithead and I don’t make any sense and well I would think Jack would be the type of person who’d just let me keep talking because well jack is awesome. But Id hate it if jack felt obligated to talk with me. Because people shouldnt feel obligated to do anything. Or maybe they should I havent decided and I don’t want to think about it right now.   But thats basically what happened and so I let Jack go to sleep but I kept talking and I cant remember what I said but that was me being tired not drunk and then drugs called me up so I talked to her for a little bit, I think she was in a dilemma of sorts but I think maybe she was just drunk. And I also think shes a good kid so it shouldnt matter.   Nothing really matters. In a good way, not in a bad way. Well rather I mean to say, nothing really matters to the extent that you should get riled up about it. Unless its really important. And people who think some things are important are alright. Im almost jealous of them because they have like morals and beliefs. But I guess maybe sometimes you should get all cracked out about things you care about. Its probably very important and like defining. So I will retract that beginning statement and say that nothing matters when nothing is everything. Hey that sounds alright. Yea think about it. I guess it would mean that everything matters. Which is true, possibly.   Ok im done, maybe I will get to go out tonight. Doubtful though. Hey no worries. 	 “Feeling good was good enough for me”-janis yo.    ok so I wrote that on word because the computers being gay, and well I never posted it before and I just got back from training aka practice and its 9pm so I will continue on in the same post-age. The strange thing about post-age is that its also a word like postage stamp.   But anyway I just got back, im still wearing my football boots too. I usually take them off before I get in the car but today I didnt. Theyre comfortable on now, and they feel secure probably because I’ve been wearing sandals for a good while now. This wasnt meant to be metaphorical but I guess shoes are. You know on Cheers once, Norm made a comment about genius people picking good shoes, like J.C sandals and Einstein Loafers. I liked it. It was funny. Norm was a good guy. anyway Im very dirty and soon I will possibly take a shower.  I love football boots and football socks and white boots with colored socks, in my very honest opinion they make you look better than in black boots. Anyway it’s a long story. Tomorrow we were supposed to go to the beach but its supposed to rain and we were going to go Friday but in preparation for standardized testing, its no drinking, well atleast for me. Maybe I will learn mathematics tonight also in preparation but that is doubtful. I don’t think that test really measures your intelligence I think its just if you get an easy test that fits you then youll do well. Im a big veteran you know, I’ve taken it twice, thats two times.   I think we lost Beatles 1. I miss that cd, you could listen to it the whole 27 or so straight through. Well it also had this great cd book thing, a bunch of albums in all different languages. And hey I wont be afraid to say it, ok yea I like david bowie. I don’t know my favorite song. I get sad when you buy a cd and you cant listen to all the songs because some of them just arent as good as the rest. I feel bad. And yea I enjoy that meatloaf song. 50 ways to leave your lover is nice because it rhymes. This is a music paragraph because im listening to music. And I like schoolhouse rock. I was also notified today that they plaed an old salute your shorts on “u pick nick” and I was mad I missed it. That show was a class act.   Hey so I think the grounding and lockdown has been loosed up a little bit and I can go out tomorrow. I feel bad for being a bad kid but sometimes you cant let your parents say everything they want without some commentary. Especially if what they are saying isnt true. I cant stand people talking about shit like it’s the truth when its not. But I guess if its true for them then its true. But its not true for me.   Im talking to brian as I write this. I love him so much because hes a slut and hes my boy from the craddle. Like thats growing up and puberty shit right there. From way back in the day. 6th grade when they threw the 2 teams together for total domination, its been good times ever since. Even before that, there was the brendans tones kids rivalry. Which was stupid but vicious all the same. Turf wars mother fuckers. And then when we thought aoife was gothic, oh good times. Slipknot yeaaa. Or the best was when my whole family slept at aoifes house because they were too drunk to drive. All family sleepover, yea thats real functional. But anyway brian makes me laugh and he always has nice jeans and sweaters and hes straight up. And so this paragraph will be dedicated to him. Sooner or later my favorite memories will get on here, they arent complete yet.    hey so my dad walked through the house the other day with fiberglass yellow stuff, and id be lying if I said I didnt have the urge to use it as a pillow.   I want to be enlightened, I want to know stuff and be sure about it. Now I realize the whole point of doing anything and the whole mystery or whatever of things is the fact that nothing is ever solid and unchanging. Change is a big fucking deal like in everything and it’s a big deal with me, atleast. Like im not too good with the whole change situation. But I think im a good bullshitter. Like thats why I can write so much in one little post guy, because I can go on for a good while with the old bullshit. You may know this or you may not. Its how we all write papers, pure and utter bullshit.   Im not a fucking romantic or anything but I think itd be good and like you know important if you like had a defining moment like in the movies. Like a moment when you put it on the line and it comes through like a fucking winning team man. I think that would be alright. I think it be important. Anyway enough of that shit. On to the next order of binazzz.  Ok so ac/dc is playing and im in the right mood to type fast. Its 1230 AM. AM ahaha. Ok so maybe jack will think im gay for talking about her so much, but I don’t care, and everyone else if you think im gay then a. you don’t understand and 2. Suck it. But anyway so sometimes jack doesny realize it right but ill be talking to her and ill be smiling because the kid is like gold, like shell say the most profound things. And they will just be good things. and even jackhenry chronicles has the most profound things and theyre nice. it’s a good thing to do when your bored, read someone elses chronicles, which you just might be doing now as you read this. Coincidence I think not.   Ok I was listening to the song layla, clapton style. And I was wondering who is layla. I bet shes really happy or proud someone wrote a song for her, or about her as the case may be. I think it would be a big deal to have a song about you and have other people listen to it. Its like you got a slice of time and its all yours. And its there forever and no one will ever forget it. Because music cant be forgotten. Especially good music. In the song me and julio, I whistle along with the whistling part, I can whistle pretty alright if I try. And in the song freebird I do the mean 3 minute air geetar solo. You should try it, its fun. Once we made an air instrument band in the back of the suburban, we were sober too. It was a good time. Jack was my best friend for the entire month of may. I like reality tv. And documentaries. I like people too. Even though before I said I hated them somewhat. Its ok to contradict yourself emerson said. But really people are great and they are funny. And I think the funniest is when people are funny and they don’t even know it. I don’t like coffee or spiders really. Im not good on rollercoaster rides. I only have a few pairs of jeans. They are comfortable. My hair is in my face right now and im too lazy to move it. I just did with a twist of the neck. Im telling you everything, almost everything in my mind right now because im afraid that it might be important and that I might forget it. And if I forget it, I might miss out on something life changing. But I believe that fate will take care of me and you and all of us and I also believe that everything is life changing, even if its small. And I believe the power of thought is a great thing we all have. I like to drink a few beers with the buddies every once in a while. I know everyone is fucked up so it doesnt matter so much if I am or if you are, because we all are. But I also realize we are fucked up not because of us but because of the people around us and what they have said and taught us. And I do think at the end of the day nothing is bad and everything can be good, and it only gets better mother fuckers, its about to get better. I’ve got that good peace train feeling. You know the “ I been smiling lately thinking about good things to come, and I believe it could be something good has begun....”   sometimes I wonder if anyone reads this, and sometimes I worry if they think im gay for doing this, but even if they do I don’t care because im not gay about it, it’s the truth and its how I feel at this point in time. So cheers to us all. And to all a good night.     Murph986: iamthewalrus Loudmac35: did u jus make a comment about my weight   oh maddie, you damn comedian, try the salmon, im here all week.

      Ok so today I woke up and finished watching this movie I was watching last night. I also drank gatorade. Then mom asked me if I wanted to go to get breakfast so I said yes. Today phil graduates 8th grade  which I guess is a big deal even though he doesnt think so and I don’t think so either. But when I graduated I was scared shitless bc I had to sit up front and then give a speech and I was laughing the entire time and then when I had to go talk I seriously almost shit my pants. That place was crowded too. Even now in school when I have to talk or give a speech or whatever I get nerviosa. Also at the start of games and stuff. I used to get butterflies in my stomach when I was little going to practice the tae kwon do. I don’t know why because that wasnt really something taht should constitute nervous feelings but whatever. Anyway my point is sometimes if you have to talk in front of people you should make them laugh a little because when you make them laugh or when you hear laughter it makes you less afraid. Unless they are laughing at you, but usually people are pretty nice and don’t laugh at you if your doing a horrible job they would feel sympathetic or something. So when someone laughs at you I guess it’s a good thing because they really don’t thnk youre doing too bad because they feel comfortable enough to laugh, unless theyre horribly mean which would be someone like me. Today my mom was like choking on a sweet in the car and I was laughing. It was funny. I felt bad for laughing but it was really funny. It would be really dangerous to be choking while driving because you could loose control of the wheel and like die. I guess its ok that I laughed because I tried to help her and I tried to make her think I wasnt laughing. Then we went to borders. We had to get a scholarship book because we are poor and I have to go to college. I guess. I also got this side of paradise, I realize I could have checked it out from the library but 1. We have overdue books from the year 94 and 2. Books are a good investment. You can substitute the letters a and b for 1 and 2 and people will still know what you mean, I think thats cool.  Finding a true statement is hard. Because you could say something and it might not be true. Its hard you know. Mary knows because sometimes I ask her to do it. Not mary my mom. Mary my bro from up north. Thats a good kid right there. Mary has red hair. She is a skank ass hoe. She has one of my best hoodies. Shes supposed to play gaelic but is way too cool for that shit. Mary is a north side bastard. She thinks shes poor but shes not. I guess its ok though because mary is my boy. Shes always got dramatic shit going on sometimes and its cool because I never have the crazy shit she has going on. Sometimes bad things happen and shes a strong kid I think for getting through all that. Like with people dying and shit. She told me on April fools taht she broke her leg. I was concerned, shes a lying piece of shit. Sometimes she tells me im smart but what she doesnt know is that I can cheat well. She used to think I was pagan. Shes a fucking republican. But if im ok with that, you can be ok with that too.   Ok done and done. Keep the peace while still disrupting it somewhat. Maybe its disturbing it. I don’t know. My moms said I could go out on Tuesday which means.....  IM BACK IN THE GAME.                                                                   Goodbye ruby tuesday.   pps-that song was on in borders today. i was happy.   ps- right now im making dinosaur noises  pre ps- did you notice the reversal of the post scripts. oh im a tricky bastard.

      this is again 2 in one day. actually its closer to tomorrow morning now,technicalities.   Ok so its like 11:57 now and by the time I finish this it will be past 12 so you can look at it as either being morning or night. You know sometimes its good to have a black and white. Like with time at 12 noon and 12 midnight thats what designates technically the portions of the day. Its just nice to have that sometimes. Like no grey area. Sometimes I like a little grey though. Like soft grey sweaters. I like soft sweaters. I actually like sweaters in general. With patterns. Tweed is pretty cool too. It’s a solid kind of fabric/ pattern. Im not really sure. I could pick one and pretend im right but im working on being totally honest and somewhat open. Sometimes certain things just hit you in the right way and it feels important. Maybe its sometimes a small thing like a song, other times its big things like a situation. Well im just talking about for me so maybe im making this up. But who knows. Its just like a wave of a feeling that comes over you and you just feel like something important or something good is happening. You know like this exact moment you could remember for a long time. I got a few beers and id like to talk to my best friend at this time. Who knows though. Oh today I had a great idea to steal all the beer in the fridge and then just smash the bottles to make it look like they fell out, luckily some voices of reason told me not to do that because that would have been fucking stupid and obvious. But then if I had got found out I would just have said mom chill out sterk and I will replace it tomorrow. And everything would have been fine. I believe it.   But anyway I just watched this movie and at some parts it made me want to cry. And im not the type of person to cry about a movie. But it was a good movie and it was sad and happy at the same time. It was more happy than sad you know though, because it ended well. I don’t know why it made me want to cry so I will pretend it didnt make me feel that way and retract my last statement. I am tired and my contacts are getting dry. Im not cool. Im not hip. I don’t represent my white gymmies and I don’t tan. And I guess in some places thats what cool is. I drink beer and I like bread. I sometimes only eat half of the crust.   Sometimes I wonder who is reading this and I try to cater it to who that might be. Hey if it was up to me id cater it all toward my best friend, but jacks not the only one who’s reading this. And im sure other people are saying to themselves what the fuck is this kid talking about and why is she obsessed with this kid named jack. Well you know what, I don’t fucking care. Even though I do care a little what people say and think, I decided if you think about that shit too much you get way paranoid and its just not worth it because who cares really.   I cant see myself having a job. I cant see myself as being old. Sometimes I stutter when I get excited. But it’s not a real stutter its more of a bunch of words stuck in my mouth that wont come out fast enough. I want a new pair of sandals because my other ones are real dirty and smell bad. I may have stated this earlier.  And I really want to put on a uniform soon, particularly a black and white one, if you know what I mean.   Theres this show on vh1 now talking about how britney spears is loaded and all the expensive shit she owns or buys. Sometimes I don’t understand expensive shit. But I guess its cool because some people like nice things like that.  Like you know classic rock and how our parents got to listen to it when it was big time and it was the thing back in the day. Sometimes I feel bad for listening to it because our generations kids wont have as good as classic rock. If you think about it you know. We gota go back 1 generation to find good shit, theyll have to go back 2. That sucks.   I like dependable things. Like tv shows that are on at the same time every week or day. And sometimes your parents are pretty dependable.   I don’t like typical things or people. Reilly knows what im talking about because weve spoken about it in depth. I mean like theres just a problem with people sometimes and theyre just so typical and they say things, that may be the right things but even if they are the right things theyre not because you already knew they would say something like that. And they don’t surprise you and they don’t change it up very much. They toss around important things like theyre not important and they play a role. They sometimes own khaki pants. They make you feel like your typical too. Im not sure if that makes sense. Its 1 AM now.......ahahahaha AM. Jajahaha = spanglish.  I hate when things fade out. Or maybe I hate them more if they just get cut short when its still burning strong. But I think when things fade out then atleast you can prepare yourself. But the overal worst is when its just fades, not even out or away, like just fades. Like you know someone and you cant really talk to them because its just too faded at the time. Well for future reference if I am one of those people who you think you have or had faded with, don’t worry I welcome a reverse of the fade, because sometimes its fresh and new yo. I don’t know if that makes much sense either. Apologies.   Ok so my best friend gave me her books and some papers and I look through them, like more than twice I have done this. I don’t look through them for any scholastic reason, I think its primarily because...I don’t know really. I read jack henry a lot too. Even though it’s the same thing. Its almost as good as letters because the background is green and I really like green. Its because im irish isnt it, you damn racist bastards. And I also just listen to old messages from time to time too. It’s a little creepy but maybe by saying this now so that she could know, it will make it less creepy. Like standardized testing. Which reminds me the act is coming up. 			 phil just brought me some gatorade, I am going to go watch the movie rushmore with cool ethan aka jason schwartzmann. And by the way the guy from pete and pete is a cool guy. I met him once. Actually thats a lie, but if I was to meet him im sure I would say that, even if it wasnt true, but I would try not to lie. 		  I tried to make this short, but I failed. Apologies.  								Sincerely,  					Its hard to think of a good name so I will leave it like this.   p.s.- peace and chicken grease.

      Ok so its pretty low key over it. Its way too low key, nothing is happening. I wish I could just do something. This is not the best environment for someone with undiagnosed ADD. I really do think I’ve got it. Or maybe just the stuff they teach is not interesting enough. I didnt have a problem learning those 25 amendments or anything, because I want to. So maybe I don’t have ADD. But that would be great on the act if I did. They give you extra time and shit. But I guess you have to kind of to bad in school to have ADD, and I keep my grades alright and stuff. Im wearing glasses right now, and I had cereal this morning. Golden grahams. One of my personal favorite, might I add. I might. Ahah, some times I laugh at myself, not because I think im particularly funny but because some things are just weird like when you say AM like a robot. Thats just funny shit. But anyway today I woke up and Brian asked me to hit up GP, which I wanted to do SOOOOOOOOOO bad. The extra O’s are supremely necessary to show the extent of the want to go.  But my moms and pa were being gay as fuck again this lockdown shit is really starting to get to me. I mean the best friend had a little birthday party and I was no esta aqui. Or alli in that case. Buts its cool because sometimes phone drinking games are enough for me and I bogarted a few beers from fartymarty and drank them in honor of the number 18. But I decided theres no use dwelling on the matter because a dwelling is just a place where indians live. So im listening to sean paul for no particular reason. Me and him go way back. Remember that one day at summer league when we were listening to him and then we forgot the shoes or the forms or something. Man those were good times last summer. Oh Sean-a Paul. Mith Withz you a dick suckin hoe. Oh hey so I figured out all my grades and I don’t think I failed any exams which is a first. I usually get a sweet 30 or 40 in math, but this time I got a 75, which looks good because I think thats a C. Or atleast it should be. But I really shouldnt be talking about this shit because it’s a whole 3 months til it needs to be spoken about again. I apologize. I have basically no events to tell you about. I could look at this lockdown as a good thing because when I get back I will appreciate the freedom and abuse it even more than usual. It aint no thing but a chicken wing.   Today I will do absolutely nothing of any merit, because lockdown is fucking gay. Whatever man, no worries at all. Maybe ill go for a brisk 26.5 mile walk to moraine valley my future school in about a week. Oh good times mother fuckers, its always good times. Hey I would just like to say suck it. And on a lighter note. Bite my butt.   					-if you don’t know by now then youre a piece of shit  p.s- its just a traditional ps.

      here are some other things i have noticed or decided. i will speak of fate now.  ok so over the past few weeks or months, or this year in general, stuffs happened and its all been down to fate. i think fate brings you so far and brings you where you are, takes you where your going. everything that happens to you has got to be a matter of fate. So many great things have happened that if I was to sit down and credit it to something other than fact it would just be an act of ignorance.  its proven in the daily relationships and expereinces we have with people. fate is tricky though, haha tricky is a funny word. but anyway i thikn the thing with fate is we dont realize its done so much for us until things have already happened. i think we as people are a lot slower than other things, because like with fate we dont notice it until were on hindsight or whatever its called. there has got to be a higher power directing some shit like fate and love. its proof. people write books and songs about it.  i dont mean to sound gay but i think the relationships and friendships that we have with other people are living definitions of who we are. you know with school and whatever else that may seem important, in the end and in the pure simplicity of things none of that matters. all that matters is how you interact with people. like i know everyone will or has felt isolated or solitary at one time or another but its just not the truth. its like fate drives those friendships and relations and those friendships and relations also drive fate. its the freaking circle of life yo. but really i mean there is nothing greater in the world than having a good time with good people. its the truth. its why we all drink, its why we all go out and play. when you strip down everything from life youre left with yourself and the people you know and i guess the big guy too. thats all you have. its not anything more than that.\ mean like we all know some really great kids and people and if you honestly believe that it wasnt a higher power that brought them into your life then youre a big butt. butt ahahaha. really though, fate is not controlling at all. Its us who have faith in it. I trust in it. And sometimes you don’t realize how much you trust in something and you don’t realize how much you can trust in something and sometimes its even hard to acknowledge that you can trust in it but the truth of the matter is that we all can.   Its just proven, some things are beyond coincidence. The great people we know are living proof. somethings are beyond even ourselves. trust those things. those are the pure things. the ones that arent fake, the ones that arent plastic. realize that those things are the right things and the good things. Not to sound gay but dude you can see it in the eyes of people sometimes, and they know and maybe you know that things are good. It’s the people we know who are brought to us by fate that actually show us how much fate has done. Its those people and those good times that have shown me that its always good times, even when it doesnt seem so much like the good times, it still most definitely is. Its these people who hook us up mad style yo. Its times like these with dinosaurs and all that good stuff. And its in all the good people I have ever known, and the good people I know. I hope that maybe you could understand.

      hey so i was writing on this yesterday and i had a big whole thing about my best friends birthday and then mother mary went on the computer and fucked it up. i almost went lethal on her. Lethal= catching flies with cat like reflexes and charisma. Actually no charimsa that word just came to mind. WHy? who the fuck knows.  so im listening to my best friends favorite song yo. and its her birthday, coincidence....nope. its sign. actually i actively sought out listening to this song, so maybe not so much of a sign because i had a part in the coincidence. Anyway 18s a big deal i guess because you can do all that shit that people who are 18 can do. So anyway one night with drugs this kid played my best friends favorite song and it was a good time. Im not trying to be gay or anything but theres something about being outside listening to music with some drink in you that makes me happy. but anyway big 1-8. im just really excited its someones birthday, actually no im really excited its jacks birthday. jacks fucking A+. righteous. i like that word. man having best friendship makes me feel little again. because its pretty simple, you got a best friend and your best friend gots dibbs on most shit and if your best friend ever had a problem you know what to do because the solution is always jacking someone in the face. atleast thats how i think of it. and then everyone goes and gets drunk.   anyway i wanted to make these shorter but it looks as though thats just not about to happen. i could consciencously (sp) make an effort to cut them short but then i would have to pretend that i cut my leg and thats just a lie. Yesterday i cut my fingers though, it was an acident. i will explain. i was washing the dishes and i had to wash this big knife so i started running over the tips of my fingers slowly jus for the hell of it and then i lost concentration and cut my pointer and middle guy, its not too bad just like a paper cut. this made me think about people who jump off buildings, i think i want to jump off a small building like maybe 15 ft high just to see if i could land without breaking my feet or something. so that got me thinking maybe people who jump off buildings just do it to see if they can land and maybe they just forget the buildings really high and they dont realize theyre going to get squashed until theyre mid-air. anyway that makes no sense i just want to jump off a small building for the hell of it, and then everyone goes and gets drunk.   i wish i had a good book to read, or just an interesting book. i wont lie im a sucker for teenage movies. i think theyre great or actually i realize theyre retarded but theres something about watching a movie about people your age. last night i watched better off dead with john cusack, it was made in like 1985. its real good and this guy gets dumped and keeps trying to kill himself but not really because he doesnt really want to, its just funny shit. i cant explain it. dallas the argentine told me about it and last night on lockdown i saw it so i rented it. that was a pointless paragraph, and then everyone goes and gets drunk.   ive recently decided to make myself ungrounded within the next 3 days. i take that stupid act style on like the 12th then i start summer school on the 14th. so marys gota recognize this is my last week of nothing and shes gota represent the fact that everyone goes and gets drunk.  hey so on friday aka the last day of school i got a ride home with kim in her sweet pickup. i think even though shes not a real mex, even though she is, shes got predisposed genes for pick up trucks and hoop earrings. she tries to fight the urges but you cant fight your genes forever.   having a favorite song is way harder that it seems.   But anyway my mom always wants to brush my hair. i dont let her. theres somethings you cant let your parents get away with. theres somethings you cant let your teachers get away with either. like jmac, if we didnt keep her in her place everyonce in a while shed get all tyrantial. but ive learned how to rape the system its hard. jim morrison said if you make peace with authority you become authority. its basically like this, you make your parents think your a good kid and dont give them too much shit, just give them shit in your head and just dont say it outloud. that way they think theyre getting away with shit when really youre rocking the mic in your mind. and thats all that matters. actually i dont know what matters, everyone just goes and gets drunk.   ok so the rest of this will be directed toward my best friend. because the reason this thing is even up and going is because my best friend. i mean if i never started writing those letters to jack i would have never started this i dont think. the madstyle increase of writing led me to start chronicling shit, i mean i always wanted to before but i was lazy and shit. i might have stated that at an earlier date or time. but anyway, focus. the bottom line, even though this isnt really the bottom line because its like in the middle, anyway the bottom line is jack is my best friend. and i think by saying taht it should be enough. bc to me best friend means a whole lot more than just best friend. and well that kid is solid, solid gold.   always remember: jeremiah was a bullfrog. and i will  always  help you drink your wine.    happy day of birth to those people who were born today and if one of those people is my best friend perhaps i would say pop a balloon in celebration of birth and awesomeness  -me or maybe its not me, but im 99.9% sure, like antibacterial soap.   p.s- this is a song i was just listening too and i dont know it seems alright  "Now men with purple hearts, carry silver guns. And they will kill a man for what his father has done. But what my father did, you know it don't mean shit. I'm not him. So you think I need some discipline, well, I had my share. I have been sent to my room. I've been sat in a chair. And I held my tongue. I didn't plug my ears. No, I got a good talking to. And now I don't know why, but I still try to smile when they talk at me like I'm just a child. Well, I'm not a child. No, I am much younger than that. And now I have read some books and have grown quite brave. If only I could just speak up I think I would say that there is no truth. There is only you and what you make the truth."

      ok well it was the last day of school, take a few examens and be done with it. Its good like that. Foxy was all like "hey you now behavior over summer and ill see you senior year" WHy do people think i dont behave, ill tell you why...the color of my skin. Exactly. But its cool because shes little and has small baby hands. She always wears collar shirts and sweaters. She reminds me of a baby. But in a nice way. Jmac got a haircut also. She was definitely wearing hairspray today too. Ill miss her next year because she does acid. I will miss ruth and nina too, and even bobby cislo. Actually i wont miss any of them but i will miss the cracked out shit that happens in their presence. but that good old junior year is over and it was all around good times. Productive and what not. I could talk about being a senior now but i wont because it seems too cliche with an accent over the e. for emphasis of course. im still on lockdown, its cool though because it just feels like something i gota do for a while and it doesnt really bother me too much. Even though sometimes it does, i pretend it doesnt and then i go and jack phil in the face. i cant think of anything else to write so i apologize if this sucked. actually i dont, because its summer and thats what i have been waiting for since septemeber. It doesnt feel like 3 years have gone by in that joint but i guess they have because im not one to argue with time or anything. BUT ANNOUNCEMENT. tomorrow is my best friends day of birth, also emma's too. they are one year apart though. but its cool to share your birthday with someone i think its got to mean something except i dont know what it would mean. but anyway  happy 18th and 17th aniversary of 9months or so after your parents did it and successfully united sperm and egg to make a baby zygote.     ok i will make like tom and cruise......oh damn  "then what the fuck was the alamo for" -outside providence.    i also cut the grass today and got freckles and green feet. no worries i washed the feet but the freckles are still there

      Its low key, good times. I was bored or as the french would say bor-ed and well this is what happened. Its been very low key with all those finales going on. getting out of school and shit at like 10 oclock in the am. Say A.M. like a robot really fast and it will make you laugh. Jajaja. I have decided to pursue writing with punctuation, but I am slightly retarded so I am not sure if it will work. I can try though. Hey so after the last ACT I told stephanie una murphy, which would be me in the 3rd person, anyway i told her that i was going to study for weeks in advance or atleast start studying 2 weeks before the one in June. I havent done that, i feel bad because i like even numbers but i dont know if i care so much and im also not sure if a point will make a difference. but to me i think it would. But anyway today we took that sweet biology test and i needed a sweet 98, well really a 97 but i told myself a 98 so i would have one point leeway. (is that a word?) Anyway my point is you can make yourself think anything if you tell it to yourself enough times. That sentence looks retarded.  it is thursday. I havent taken a shower since monday. Thats going strong for atleast 4 days yo. Tomorrow is the last day of school. I will write in short sentences because it is better. Or not so much better just nicer. Anyway We gota get a job, and by we i mean me and sterk because for some reason the law has been coming down hard on us. Sometimes i wish people would just tell me what to do and then i could do it. sometimes i dont wish that so much. But even with stuff in school where you have to choose yourself i wish they would just tell you what to do. sometimes they tell you too much though. so really im drunk right now.    This thing has no point, maybe i am supposed to make a complaint about something or say how much i like something, or maybe tell stories that have happened. but thats kind of mean if you dont understand the story or if you werent in the story. i actually dont know if there are requirement for these chronicles. Ok i can talk about summer if you want, if you dont want to read this then just stop. But here i will now detail my plans and aspirations for summer.   1. shoot the shit- shooting the shit is comparable to the feeling you get when you drink outside on a summer night when its nice and warm/cool....temperate possibly. its like being able to just chill and talk to people about good things, shooting the shit is having a good conversation with someone or some people who are good people. Its low key, and sometimes it happens at a beach or at a backyard. Its relaxation. Yo. Reilly knows about shooting the shit, or aka shooting the breeze  2. play lots of gaelic- i wholeheartedly hope to play lots of gaelic and get better. i usually dont like hard work or runnning or trying hard at anything, but gaelic its different because i dont mind trying to get better so much. The gaelic supercedes most things. its one hell of a time. hopefully it will be a good year.  3. get an easy job- i possibly need to attain an easy job where i dont have to do hard stuff and also dont have to talk to people that suck.  4. go to the beach repeatedly- i would enjoy going to the beach and walking in the sand. i like beaches at night and not so much in the day. I like when the sand is cold and i also like when you can drink by a fire but thats just me being all romantic. i keed.   (oh that reminds me, billy bogart called me up last night and asked me to look at the full moon, billybogart was clearly getting all romantic and sexual, when i commented on the fact that im easy and that you dont need romantic full-moon lines to make out with me, billy denied all reference to sexing it up. whatever billy. Biros the crack whore also did this very same thing last week when she serenaded me in her car to country music. where do people get off trying to bogart my lovin' like this.)yo, i keeeed.  5. Go on the roof- it has been a long time goal to go on that roof. we have 1 soccer ball and 1 rubber chicken missing in action up there and i would really like to see them retrieved. I would like to drink on the roof but i think it would be smarter to go up there sober just to "test the waters" and then if we get away with it, start bringing a cooler up there. Padre murph has ladders, so we just need to bogart them. this should not be a problem if we focus on the task.   6. make sweet love to the ACT- i just want to rape it. i want dallas to rape it to because she is as smart as an argentine could be and deserves atleast a 33.  RHYMES!(necessary)  7. Dethrone satan. this plan should be made in summer and carried through next year.  8. Go to Denver and win- i dont know how likely this will be, but its an aspiration and i am just being honest. maybe just beat the brigids because they like women sexually, and im slightly homophobic. sorry all gay people i know, if any. Also id like to go to NY. Im lookin forward to seeing some prostys play this year. that will be good times.   9. Do that whole college thing.-self explanatory.   10. Read some good books-self explanatory.   11. learn to drive-possibly not due to mama murphs bi-polarity  12. Make a summer movie.  13. drink 40s with my best friend.- notice that 40s is plural. ahh, dinosaurs ( make not the #13 does not signify the priority # of this goal, its really like top 2)  14. see jen atleast once-highly unlikely  15. see the gods at least once-likely  16. make 3 new friends.  17. go atleast 7 days strong, 2 times.   18. acquire some old  salute your shorts  and  wonder years  tapes  19. do many other things which i will think of later and we will publish them on notebook paper as always.    ok now sometimes i think i talk about beer too much, but really the act of drinking beer brings people together. Im all about having people together in a community or group. Its a beautiful thing to have people together united under one common goal. Now i may seem obsessed with the drink, but in reality im just obsessed with gettin people together and having them chill....with beer of course. i keed i keed. the fact that beer brings people together also reinforces my point that hard liquor is just not as social of a drink. sorry im irish, not polish(polish,read, read, wind, wind, tear, tear) and on a lighter note, suck it   prosty reunion this summer. get ready for it.

      	Hey so I have to continue this, not because I have to but because I want to because I am endearing toward my best friend mother fucker. But anyway, im on lockdown as you may know and im on lockdown because that little drinking ticket. 100$ in the hole, no worries, its only a little kink in the works, twist in the road. Aint no thing but a chicken wing.  	Anyway I got my schedule today and all I care about is that me and the dallas are reunited under spanish and english for the 4th consecutive year in a row, the big guy wants us to be the tag team of languages. Mother fucker. It was good times every year so far, the english department definitely has some of the best teachers....ex. Apcel, Chris lorent, Jmac. Sweet baby hansen is by far a laugh and a half. Rhymes but doesnt look like each other. Stran-jay. Homophone, homonym, who knows!? Exclamation necessary for emphasis on the unknown and confusion factor.   	Ok so I can see how this could be seen as retarded but you know sometimes you just need a way to write shit down and I don’t really care if this stupid because your even more stupid for reading it. So HA. Unless your like my best friend or someone else I think is cool, in that case youre not stupid at all. Youre cool and shit.   	Ok so the ticket spurred a whole change of attitude so now I have to be nicer and stop swearing, like a sailor/truckdriver. I can be pretty articulate when im sober....see I just said the word articulate, if I was drunk right now I would have said “I can talk real smart and shit when im not fucking drunk and shit yo” but in sobriety that translates into > “ I can be very articulate under the choke holds of sobriety.” Whatever I just like to bullshit around for a while so people don’t think Im a rock. But anyway I think Im an obnoxious asshole because I just am, I don’t even try on purpose I just say the things that come to mind sometimes and I don’t think about them first. It can get you into trouble. But most of the time its ok when you run around the halls like a wee little Indian or native american.....Indian=zack. Oh I miss zack. Those were good times. But anyway my point is there never is a point this isnt even real. But if this paragraph had a point it would be to state publically that I have to become a better person. Even though my vision of a better person isnt the same as everyone elses. Because you can be seen as a good/nice person but it could be all fake and shit. That could be why I don’t want a job with people involved because I couldnt stand being fake nice to them and social interaction in general is stupid unless its voluntary or drunken. And I wouldnt want to go to work drunk ALL the time, actually yea I would but its not socially acceptable.   	Today in Biologia, ruth basically made us write thank you letters to her, like it was mandatory. It was rather strang-jay. I don’t know what crack shes been smoking but she sure hasnt taught in a few weeks and I think her brains getting all fucked up from the acid. Oh that reminds me.... "you know what dont take acid because you could possibly die on a bad trip ok bye.. bye"-thats my best friend and shes smart and shit so people should listen to those words of advice. You should just listen to people, only certain people, ones you can trust and have them be the voice of reason. That way you can have solid advice. But back to the whole thing about being fake nice. I hate fake nice people. They might not even be fake nice, but rather traditionally nice. I don’t like traditional nice. Its too jacked up. Also the word jack is versatile like the word fuck. Hey this is my best friend jack. Im going to jack you in the face. Go jack off. This is jacked up. Go get the car jack. This is a car jack, hi jack im greg this is my sister marsha. Or something like that. But my point is I don’t like traditionally nice people and I cant really explain it but theyre the kind of people that have fake smiles and I don’t know maybe im making this up but you cant really say anything because this is MINE not YOURS haha. But I think there is a comment part I don’t know how that works though. Anyway its finale week and I guess I should go estudiar but on my tests I need like either 18% or 40% or like 130% to keep or change my grades so its KOO. The moms freaks out when shes sees F’s though like even on exams. Its cool shes a decent lady.   Oh the weekend was low key yo,  I talked to my best friend and other people also from my incarcerated cell. It was cool I like talking to people when they are out, even if im the opposite of out which would be, in. Youd think id get mad or sad or something but I don’t really get mad/sad at all. Also sometimes I get a sweeping fear that im missing out on something great or awesome. But if I don’t think about it so much then its all good. And its ALWAYS all good. Sometimes I don’t want people to think im stupid, sometimes I don’t care, sometimes I feel like I got to prove myself, sometimes I don’t. Usually if you throw a few 2 syllable words into a conversation people don’t think your so stupid anymore. Try it. It works.  I hate the phrase “I feel” its such a stupid thing to say. Well atleast thats what I think. Im still wearing my feather that I got today in school. But anyway this weekend was rather chill. But the bros came over from the gaelic. Aoife, brian donal and their friend mary. I love those kids. Theyre solid and its ok to be dysfunctional because theyre way Irish. Like the supreme echelon of Irish immigrants.  Not even south side irish style. This is real Irish. To be real Irish there are many requirements. I will give some examples if you like. You have to see your parents and other peoples parents trashed at one time or another. And it has to be on a Sunday. You have to respect the gaelic. You have to wake up early on sundays to go watch or play the gaelic. You have to not match well. You have to have parents who swear a lot. You have to have cousins over there. You have to realize the tones were screwed out of a decent final last year. You have to know Lisa Kreugers from county cook, and that her accent is from which ever old blind Irishman she slept with the night before. Ohhh you got punk’d. Sorry lisa youre still hot. Get me a coke will ya dear. Oh and you have to have a Nana. Biatch. Oh man this got way to long, I apologize. But really I don’t because I don’t care, I hope you enjoyed reading about absolutely nothing. Maybe one day ill tell you all about the joys of gaelic park, those of you who don’t already know. A little summary, gaelic park is somewhere to take your kids from the tender age of say...birth and let them play all day, get vicious sunburn and dehydrate while you yourself get dehydrated from all the over-priced 2$ beer. Then when they get old enough to play gaelic you let them go off with all the other urchins and they all play together until they get awesome and just get all rowdy at the tender age of 12 and try to kick the living shit out of other children from other cities. In all honesty, nothing beats it and you cant find anything better...anywhere. I love it. Collars up, white shorts, farmers tan, crazy eyes. It’s quality. Then when your kids grow up they end up marrying each other or just having each others babies because in summer theyre around each other so much that the sex just rubs off on everyone and no one knows where the babies come from. Quality I tell you, quality. Ok I gota roll on. Ill seeya when I seeya. Anyway theres a virus on this computer I think and I thikn it may be because phil probably looks at pornographic material on here quite possibly, but im just going to pretend it never happened YO. Reilly just told me she respects my indian, drunk, mocassin lovin, fanny pack wearin ass, I love that kid. Shes a PTP....prime time player. YO. Either she really respects me or just wants to get in my pants...if thats the case im easy and you don’t have to try so hard to impress me. Its good lovin’. Seeya brother. You know eyes are really a cool thing. Im partial to blue eyed people. Its not that im not cool with brown eyes, I think I just like blue the bestest. I feel bad for saying this because my best friend doesnt have blue eyes. But shes also dark skinned and I think the darker you get the harder it is to have blue eyes. But I think Jack would be ok with it that I am partial to blue eyes, because Jack might understand that im only trying to tell the truth. BUT MAYBE JACK JUST DOESNT UNDERSTAND. I keed, jack knows I keed. But im trying to think of who has blue eyes. I know tommy d has good blue eyes because they are lighter blue. Also padre murphs got blue eyes. Im thinking I might have to marry someone with blue eyes to ensure that my children also have blue eyes because if they don’t I might end up giving them back...like to the stork.  Well I think I will end this now, its gone far too long. Sorry, im just writing down what comes to mind. Self censureship is retarded because you already got too many people trying to censor you, you might as well not add yourself to the list YO. Im done now. Peace easy brother. 						                                            -anonymous...thats a hard word to spell p.s- I hate the word blog, actually my feelings arent as strong as hatred so I dislike it. Yo.    The foreign sun, it squints upon A bed that is never mine As friends and other strangers From their fates try to resign Leaving men wholly, totally free To do anything they wish to do but die And there are no trials inside the Gates of Eden   thats my boy, he wicked smaht

      On passion. its pure shite..yes with that added e for the little Irish emphasis. im not even Irish, im Asian  Now of all characteristics and feelings, passion is the most important. Now its not just a sexual passion like hey let me take my pants off because I want to a lot. Its more of a admirable passion for something that you love or really like a lot. Now some romantics would choose love as the most important of all emotions or feelings or whatever, and no doubt I would agree that loves all you really need and that really love does fix a whole lotta things. But the strength of any love is measured by the passion given wholly to it. And so a love without passion is simply bullshit. Its really passion that determines all sorts of things, success, love, happiness, sadness as well. If someone gives themselves wholly and openly to a cause then they are yes leaving themselves open to the idea of a sadness that comes from a complete giving to something and also to the happiness that may also come hand in hand. And so with that passion is also bittersweet. It can come back to fuck you in the ass, for lack of better word-age. Passion is most definitely manifested in a persons face, especially when the object of such affection is brought up. When people talk about their passion you can just see it, it’s the truth you can see it in their eyes. I mean wether the passion be a person or activity or theory, you can tell I know you can. Its like a fucking light that goes on and it makes you feel like youre living a damn fine life. Now not to sound dramatic but if you’ve never experienced it then you sound, and if you think it sounds weird then youve never experienced someone with a great passion. And of course some people are more extroverted than others and in them you can easily see their passion. Like fucking musicians, most definitely you can see it in them when they are playing and getting into it and stuff. And others arent as forward with their passion and with them you just look deeper. Man im telling you if you know someones passions then you know their soul. Passion is the driving force behind almost everything. It determines the potential of all interaction. And the best thing is that passion can be given to anything and given completely too. Its fantastic. And its like that song, you better you bet...you know you better bet your life, right because if you arent willing to bet your life for something, then really how much is it worth to you. Now not honestly betting your life because thats dangerous but its probably metaphorical you know for big time shit...actually time spelled TYME. And its true honesty and caring and all those other adjectives you use in theology and english and the like, they don’t mean SHIT unless theyre supported by some passion. And so I believe it’s a good thing to exercise a passion for whatever you are passionate about, it’s a very great thing. But did anyone ever teach you passion, no...I may have seen it and been positively affected by someone elses love of something and then said, shit I want that. But no one can teach passion to another person. They can show them the manifestation of a passionate cause but true passion is so far and deep within you that its impossible to truly convey it in words like these. And so I just think its great when people really love something with all the passion they have and then you can tell they love it like that, and that makes me so insanely happy.   And I will probably delete this before anyone reads it because I don’t like to be critized, most no one really does. Tomorrow who knows, probably a little sleepover reunion, we’ll see what the dad says. And with this I will say hello, and goodbye.  if youve never seen the movie tommy, just watch it...its very cracked out.

      i decided today when i saw this little kid riding his bike that bikes or rather riding them is a good way to find out when you started to grow up on purpose. when i was little i used to ride bikes all the time, everyone did, to get anywhere. we'd have bike races and ride bikes to school just for the hell of it. we rode not out of necessity but out of fun. And then when you start to get older everyone wants to walk everywhere and bikes are too cumbersome...ahah funny word. well bikes are too much shit to carry and no one really rides them they just walk everywhere, this started happening around the age of 13. then you just end up riding your bike to school just because its faster and then walking other places. then maybe one day your bike would pop a tire or something and you never got around to fixing it. all of a sudden you know how to drive or in my case everyone else you know does and shit and the bike just sits in the garage. and then instead of playing in your own neighborhood or block you start travelling farther because tahts where your friends live, farther away. The bike just sits there and its sad because today i had to the urge to ride a bike and i couldnt because mine is and has been broken for years. and so i was pissed i just let it slide away like that. ive known how to ride a bike since i was like 3, my first bike was yellow and i got it back in the old country, you know its something that stays with you. and all of a sudden you just turn youre back on the riding of bikes in pursuit of other things. its very sad, because half the time we dont even realize it til its too late, til its too much hassle to change back. that happens with alot of things, and the unconcious loss of something over time sucks more than conciously neglecting it because atleast when you know something is happening you can either let it happen or make a change. but most things arent that easy you know. so yes, i would like to ride bikes more, not so much as a way to connect back to the forgotten life of a child, but because they are fun, and go fast. and thats just a thought on riding bikes on this lovely july 14, 2004 day.

      we are drinking in my basement. jean has something to say...   hello america this is jean marie miller. i have been drinkin in the greatest basement in the world and i like it. keep it simple people, always keep it simple. mr murphy went to go price a job which basically means he is going to drink wit his friends, which is what we are doin right now. we should hang out wit mr murphy more. i like to drink bud light alot. its cool to drink alot. its cool to pee your pants too. sometimes when murph drinks alot she gets the hiccups. some people think that they are annoying but i find them to be a blessing. some people will never get to hear these hiccups and i fell bad for these people. anyway murph says this computer will kick me off soon, so farewell everyone and i feel privledged to have this opportunity to say something on bitemybutt.com.

      Yea so i just sent an email to Ruth. I really heart her, like it says on the shirts. I told her to keep up the good work, champ. Shes going to think im retarded but im sure she already does. so anyway those tests came back and it all worked out decent. and thats all im going to say aboot(canadia) that because im trying to be modest. Wait fuckers, thats not my style. Im Fucking intelligent biatch, hah yea right. So the raping of the system for last year went very well on the whole. When I think of Ruth the adjectives that come to mind are quirky, beans, and sexy. 					   So today we took another test in physics and man that shit was bad, but enough said. I don’t have school tomorrow either so I will have fun tonight and then maybe go a shooping- yes I just said shooping and its not a typographical error either. I feel bad spending marys money all the time, but maybe soon when I GET A JOB, which is already in the works thanks to JEAN MARIE. Man im excited to join the work force.   Oh and today I realized how dedicated we are to beer. It would probably be so much easier to carry around hard liquor and drink that and we probably wouldnt get caught as much either, but man we are committed. We carry around backpacks that are fucking heavy, and then theres always the problem of hiding it or putting it in my fridge, and its way more evidence. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT, ITS WORTH IT. And for this I am thankful. 		  and I also realized today that Brian is almost as much a brother to me as Phil is. He even let me use his body wash. I mean I know he has fat ankles but I love him anyway. IM KIDDING. You don’t have fat ankles, you just have stubby legs...I josh you stupid bitch. Haha remember when everyone would said Just joshing. What the fuck were we thinking. Anyway I am also thankful brian is my brother.   With love, Me  ps- look for the girl with sun in her eyes, and shes gone. name the song

      its actually theburned.cjb.net  not cbj  ok so last night i went to reillys house and we got the party started kind of late like 9 30ish. it was a low key good time. and then we ended up playing strip black jack. and then the beers were drunk and so were we and it was time to go home.   "thats where i go to school, and theres knackers and i hate it"- timmy  i may have told you about timmy. hes funny and hes my boy. when he comes over its fun and he adds to the dysfunction. its a grand old time. and grand old time yes it is. i like when people come over because it makes you feel like you got a bigger family. id like a bigger family. id also like to be really convicted as i haved said before, but you know getting worked up about shit takes a bit of effort.   hey so i came home last night and made some phone calls of course and then my best friend jack called me back and i spoke with her for a while and she said you dude ill call you back so of course being the socialite that i am i didnt go to sleep right away because i didnt want to miss a telephone call. being the dedicated best friend that i am, i had no problem staying up a little later. but hey man the awakeness was in vain because i did not recieve a telephone ring. and its not that i care or mind very much because a telephone ring is a somewhat trivial thing, but dude i was a little sad for like a moment and then it was all good and i woke up on the couch at like 4 am and then woke up again at 7 to go out to watch the games. and then me and pa stayed there til about 4pm and i got sunburn...a very nice farmers tan in fact, but i got to spend the day with my boy brian who is a good laugh and joe joe was there and hes also very funny. And it was so hot, and i was wearing pants because i didnt think wed be staying the whole day but it ended up that we did and i had no problems with that cat hat rat bat chat mat gnat tat pat.    im sorry these things are so stupid and quite pointless. you just wasted time you'll never get back, please dont hold it against me.   good evening. or good (enter time of day).   tomorrow my mom goes to ireland for about a week and a half. ill miss her a fair bit. so this one goes out to the moms. i got yo back G.   i hope its not hard to buy the beer in new york.

      i was just looking at other random peoples little blogs, man i hate that word. But anyway i was looking at other peoples and basically they fit into 4 categories....some big freaks, porn, smart people with theories, and misc. you get some big time weirdos but its just fun to read what other people write. they are all much more articulate than i am and that kind of makes me think i should start writing grammatically but oh well because i wont so fuck da po lice. i basically wasted a whole day today, i woke up late and had irish breakfast...nothing beats it. i wont explain it because i dont know if vegetarians get offended when people talk about meat and im not into offending people unknowingly. i usually just offend them on purpose. but anyway then i talked to emma for like the first time in a mes. integrating spanish into the chronicle. And then i was going to go see spelman be all artistic but dal didnt wanna go so i didnt wanna go alone and that was that. then i watched some tv and for the rest of the day until now i read peoples things. i want to be more productive.   it hasnt felt like we did 3 years in that joint, but time says we have. the worst ever would be looking back and thinking i wasted some of it. so next year, the last year i will try to do a great number of things.   this one girl had a blog devoted to "anti-conformity" and she was a huge stroke. she talked about how britney spears is retarded and shit and how magazines have too many models and all that sort of thing, well kid if it bothers you so much then fuck it and dont get so swept up in it.   britney never signed a pre-nup and she bought her own wedding ring, yea thats fucked up and hey that goes to show....you cant hide from your roots. if your born white trash you return to white trash in key defining moments of your life. ah shucks brit...im just joshing.    i dont like how different groups of people have uniforms, well not uniforms persay but they all dress the same. but i really like team uniforms, and soccer jerseys.   www.theburned.cbj.net-that will answer all your public school central questions

      when you put things in bold or in italics it makes them seem more necessary and important, the same for capital letters and exclamation points. so   IF I WAS TO type this IN CAPITALS YOU WOULD THINK ITS IMPORTANT BUT ITS NOT!!!!    i think everyone should try to write something. itll start you thinking. and whatever you end up writing about is probably one of the most important things to you at the time, and well thats a good way of figuring out important things NOW AINT IT.   asian prince is so fly.   ok so the last two days i was at sues home for about 24 out of 36 hours. my favorite things about sues house are, the fine selection of music, the long table, the lemonade, the ice balls and then the other stuff you drink but since i have chosen to not speak of that anymore i will leave it to your own devices to figure out what i mean.   summers been a good time but i do hope it only gets better                                         in a most sincere way,                                my middle name could jack yours in the face

      well did ya ever get the feeling no one knows the full and real you and everyone only knows certain parts of you. and its not so much that your fake to people but no one really knows how you are in all differnt situations.   i wish i had someone who knew me as much or if not more than i knew me. itd be the ultimate good time. man having someone shout you a hollar before you even shout it yourself, well thatd be fantastic, but i think its impossible. it would contradict the whole individuality thing. and the fact that no one in the entire world is thinking the same exact thing in the same exact way at the same exact time is so crazy, even thinking about that concept makes you feel isolated.   im drunk and my muscles are a-twitching, i kinda like it but its probably bad, and my finger feels weird, but thats cool too, its like a cold sensation when i touch it with my other hand. its been 8 long days and tomorrow will hopefully be 9, im going to shoot for 10, double digits. im looking forward to some nice long sleep-age.   whenver ive been drinking i try to patch up some old fights or bad feelings, its probably a problem you should do that stuff under a sober mind but whatever, because it always works for me and i usually remember that shit gets all patched up and everyones ok. it usually only happens when the other person or persons have been drinking too so i dont feel so bad. i hate talking about drinking so much, i really do.   fake hair makes me feel like a fake. but i still wear dirty clothes. id like to think im alright but in reality im just not cool. i dont wear skirts and im a whitey and those moccasins probably arent the coolest thing ever either. ah who knows, really no one does so dont even worry about it, if its not important then you wont rememberit.  i save alot of things. i have practically no baby pictues. the shipping problems when we first came. you could say we had kind of a hard few starting months here but it all worked ou. im too dependent. i drink too much. im not nice enough to mom dad and phil, i could do better at school, i could try harder in sports, sometimes i wish i had another brother or sister so we could have a 3 kid family, i wish i could drive or have a job, i wish i didnt get so rowdy and i also wish i wasnt so obnoxious to people. i wish some people saw things the way i see things because then i could tell them my observations and they wouldnt think im retarded or an asshole, i wish i never wrote any of this but i did, i wish i had some hard core self control, iwish i didnt call jack every 5 minutes, i wish i wasnt an annoying fucker, i wish i was a better person in general, but who told you what a good person is...right who? see everyones a good person in their own respect and right, and so if youre out there reading this thinking you could be better or a better person, dont even think it....dont follow anyone elses fucking shit and expectations, do what you think is good and better in your own right nad respect because trust that some higher power who ever you think it to be, has instilled in you the makings of  an awesome kid.    im going to icy-hot my joints. LATER     HEAVEN KNOWS ITS HIGH TIME

      Well I will keep this short. I am going to the thrift to teach brian how to be dirty. Then im going to aunt berthas house to get a haircut becuase mary is a nazi and is all like yes since your pictures sucked you have to get a haircut. Its about time before my last backyard haircut I hadnt had one since well it was a while I cant really remember. I hate gettin haircuts and im probably a bad haircutee because I don’t talk to the lady nor do I want to. I hate money too. It’s a very nice thing to have but im telling you bartering or trading  is way better. So after I get this haircut and disgusting  fake shit put in it I’ll go to training and then head off to a cute little tapped keg. Sometimes training’s a pain in the butt, like bite my butt you butthole, but over all it’s a good time.   Last night I came home and the night before I came home and I talked to my best friend. Last night me and kim left crazy mexican messages to jack.    ......ok im back fromn the night and I went to hit up zulies and it was a grand old time after practice. My legs hurt but its ok. Im tired, maybe too tired to write much so in that case I shall go. I got that haircut and that fake shit put in and well whatever I don’t care too much, I do however feel somewhat fake and a sellout but I guess its ok. My hands hurt now from typing I think. I will roll on then. Vamonos.  I hate people who are different around other people or just suck in general. Yea well those people should get beat down.   Im actually goin to new york. Alone too. It should be one hell of a time.   that title is devoted to reilly.   ps-japanese animated cartoons are CRAZY

      I like reunions and also when they are outside. Im bored and it is Independence day. People went away to cottages but immigrants dont do the whole cottage thing and lots of folks are going downtown but no one wants to go see counting crows and drink with me. ah well i wonder what i will do today if i dont go to the urban sector of the city of Chicago. sometimes when i get bored its fun to think of different ways to say shit.   there was a molestation incident in the san diego house andt the mtv folk failed to reveal this to the general public. yea aint that shit crazy.   well last night i let phil timmy and donal drink in the basement. i tried to get drunk so bad but i just couldnt and i dont really know why. and its stupid to even talk about beers and drinking because i do hate when i talk about that shit. but holy shit, im not going to new york anymore which brings me sadness. i guess the shit didnt get handled in time so maybe we are just going to denver over labor day weekend instead. but mary just got the tickets for Manchester United vs Bayer Munich on the 25th, so i am excited for that but she wont let me take the bus with all the old men because she said there will be too much drink and i told her that was the point but she said it wasnt appropriate. yea ok mary. fucking chill out. i swear way too much. i dont really like swearing too much because i guess it makes you sound retarded but oh well because i thikn its FUCKING COLORFUL.   ok so my foot still hurts sometimes, its weird because its only some days its bad and others it isnt.   ok so what i did yesterday: me brian and maddie went to marias party and just laughed at the dysfunction that was so widespread and took pictures with lisa and anna. HOT STUFF! but yea and then we just sat around for a while and drove the long way home and brian wanted to stop for ice cream because hes a pregnant woman and what not so we stopped then we went to mi home and then i had to go back out to get them more beer which was a slight inconvienence but i didnt really mind. and then we watched degrassi and then we just sat around and shit. the we gave brian timmys pants which he appreciated because they looked nice on him. and brian is a good kid and HARRY POTTER, HARRY POTTER. um hi ugly. ahahah you bastard. ok and then everyone went to sleep and brian had to drive home in a monsoon and its so funny to see him run through the rain like that. oh shit man good times. and i love the 90s is coming on next week and thats going to be good shit. i might miss the second day if we end up going to wash u but who knows if that will go down.   and yes when i was young i used to watch wrestling and i used to wrestle phil in the living room in ireland. and hulk hogan was the shit. remember that movie, sometimes disney shows it now, about the surfer kid who goes east and then it turns into a skating movie or rollerblading and he has the dream about pepe the shark or something and seth green has the scene where he dressed up to the song im too sexy. yea well that movie was good. jack black is in it and scott something i think from party of 5.  ok well enough of that. ill leave ya to it.    oh and everyone go to this: http://www.geocities.com/asianprince_213/  he is total bad boy asian prince.   ok im off to watch the uefa cup final. portugal vs greece.   good afternoon. oh man i gota go i just cut my leg. ouch.

"when its talking with you, talk of the weather will do" thats a song on the summer cd for american eagle like 3 years ago, to be honest its not too bad for a free cd. and on a lighter note, suck it. and with that i shall resign.  ps-jack=drink=beers=happy=happy jack   its so simple of an equation that you just cant deny it. ITS IN THE STARS MOTHER FUCKER

      hello hello. yesterday was a good time at the beach and the taste. a strange mexican man was videotaping people at the beach and then he left after we realized he was a pervert. and i saw billy jean ginger and drugs delany rowing a boat and i guess its their job to row the boat and well rowing boats seems like a cool thing to do. then we took the train home, except me and clair got left behind and had to take an hour later train. LEAVE THE WEAK BEHIND. i had to carry the beers with the bum foot and clair had asthma. well it worked out good in the end and the security man failed to check the bag which was filled with many fun suprises.   now im going to go play a football match or game whichever you prefer and after eat some free food again hopefully. and then maybe after go to off to timmys house although i might be drinking at the homestead before that. its all flow you know. you remember that one song about backing that ass up. we were probably in 7th grade at the time. well that was a great song. in 7th grade i tried to be cool and listen to rap music and wear nice clothes but now im just a dirty bastard and regret trying to be cool, but not a big regret just a little one. but guess what i just took a shower because i was sandy from the beach and i might even take another one after this game. what do ya know, 2 in one day. insanity.   right so im off and we'll see what happens.   in case i dont talk to jack today, hey whats up, how are you keeping.   ok later days mother fuckers
