      The Jollyblogger points out....                "My point, ..., is simply that a church that is driven by an expository ministry will be more biblically grounded. If the ministry is expository-centered it should produce a hunger for the Word of God and sense of accountability to it in their lives."               I guess after a period of assessing what the essence of ministry should be, I am coming to terms with the limits of the main activity, preaching.  I, of course, am stealing my title from  urlLink Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones .  I read his classic while I was 18 the first time.  I was looking for the wrong thing at that time in my life.  Now that I re-read it in my 40's, I see how vital preaching is to the church.  You are right in your comments.  I was dealing with more of a self-centered issue for myself, that is how does one address those who are sitting in the pews but not following the excellent exposition.   The temptation for myself is to look at the limitations and get frustrated.  Sorry if I misrepresented the Jollyblogger's position.

      "Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of understanding will draw it out."   Proverbs 20:5:  "They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search: both the inward thought of every one of them , and the heart, is  deep."    Psalms 64:6:  In  urlLink 1 Samuel 6 , the Philistines set up a little truth test.  They were suffering plagues, they thought it was a result of the presence of the ark of the covenant.  While this is their suspicion, they want to check it out for sure, so they tied a cart to cattle who had calves.  Cattle who have calves will not normally wonder far from their young.  They put the ark on the cart.  If it returned to the Israelites, the God of the Israelites was the cause of their trouble.  If it did not, there was another cause.  In this way they tested their theory.  While the Philistines in this passage are evil examples for the most part, the principle of cross checking really isn't a bad one.  Our hearts are complex and we really don't understand them.  Instead of juxtaposition our thoughts and emotions we should see how they fit together.  We do this with our senses all the time, we hear a noise, we look to see what it was.  Our emotions and thoughts should cross check each other also.   urlLink My friend the Jollyblogger talks about the complexities of mind and emotions in our experiences and the validity of each.  I encourage you to look at his article.   In response to the old Campus Crusade illustration, I say that it fit a particular problem, emotionalism being used to judge facts.  For that particular problem, the illustration fit, but the illustration breaks down, as all illustrations do.  (Or else they would not be illustrations!)   The illustration does not address the whole of emotional life, nor does it address the complex and sometimes baffling relationship between emotions and thoughts.    Some Observations (or Opinions) On The Subjective experience  1.  In a court case, the verdict is often an extremely emotional experience for the accused, but the verdict is based on the facts.  The New Perspective on Paul criticisms the Reformed View by saying that the legal language used to explain a right standing with God is too sterile, too tied up in legal language.  I actually think they are thinking of hypothetical courts, not the kind where you or I actually receive a verdict.  Courts are an excellent way to explain our position with God.  We will be judged by the facts not a mere feeling or thought.  God judges rightly.  I wanted to write more about this in  urlLink my paper on the New perspective on Paul  but it did not fit my thesis.   2.  The fact that Jesus died on the cross is true whether my thoughts or emotions acknowledge it or not.  In this sense, both my thoughts and emotions need to recognize the fact.  Who would go to a concert and not want watch the movements of the orchestra as they play.  Their movement and expression are displayed as they express the whole of the piece.    3.  In our education of our youth (and ourselves) we must train their (our) affections.  Post-modernism says that anything I (or someone)  likes  is  ultimately unarguable.  While most youth who argue from this position would not recognize the statement, what they are saying is that ascetics is more important than epistemology.  In reality, our emotions and affections are sinful and must be trained, just as our sense of morality and our minds must be trained.  The big flaw in our post-modern world is that we stopped training our sense of morality and our affections and let them run ramped.  (I am making an artificial dichotomy between the three for the sake of discussion. Integrating the three in discussion makes discussion messy.)    4.  For the existentialist, creating valid subjective experience through acts of the will is an important goal.  While there are some positive things going on here, I see it as too self-centered to be Christian.

      Reading Spencer Burke in his chapter in the  urlLink Stories of Emergence: Moving From Absolute To Authentic , he defines Christian Ghetto.  He says it's "where real people with real problems are kept at arms length".  That is a little different than how I defined it earlier, but I'm not arguing against his, I'm even affirming his idea.  The Presley song about the Ghetto talks about an "angry young man".  Burke echoes the same anger and disdain I have seen in the underprivileged.  While he may have, humanly speaking, things to be angry about, I see expectations as part of the issue.  But the other issue is simply the phrase that children use when a sibling, perhaps a year or two older, becomes pushy.  They shout in a very emphatic tone, "YOU ARE NOT THE BOSS OF ME".  That seems to be a lot of what I'm reading in the emerging church literature.  While they are seeking to be authentic, they are authentically independent.  A part of genuine Christian community is mutual submission.  It sounds like to me that the emerging church has forgotten our not so distant past.  The place where I saw the most inauthentic communications was in the mainline church I was a part of where pastors hid their true theological positions in fear of loosing their jobs.  In the evangelical church we must work to let people question and explore and at the same time maintain adherence to true doctrine.  It is possible to do both, you will need the Holy Spirit's guidance, trust that he will do a work in the hearts of young ministerial students and not be lazy in the task of leadership development.  I also was surfing  urlLink Open Source Theology  site.  There they have a poll which asks why people are drawn to the emerging church, 39% are looking "theological integrity and creativity".  Where the evangelical church as a whole has failed, we should repent and again find the grace of God.  We must be careful about movements that are bolstered by anger and which fail to understand that freedom does not means we are free to NOT love our brothers.  I get the feeling that the emerging church will just be a retelling of the story "Animal Farm".  Absolute truth is not at odds with authentic life styles.  Authentic life styles are not at odds with absolute truth.  It seems that it is more about style and power rather than a heart that is seeking God authentically and a community that is a true covenant community.

      I wonder what kind of software pastors need in other countries where mission work is being done.  Pastors in overseas countries are often balancing another job.  They work extremely hard at both jobs to make it all work.  I wonder if a church management software suite would help them or if they would say they would rather have a pastor's library on a CD-ROM.  Gathering the data of needs on the mission field would be difficult and would take wisdom.  A lot of times I find that when you are attempting to define a software requirement, people have an extremely difficult time understanding their own needs.  They also have a difficult time understanding the cost associated with a whim.  Articulating what they desire is a challenge. No answers today, just questions.

      I encourage you to check out the Jollybloggers tribute to  urlLink Pat Tillman .  The part in the creed which says that a Ranger will never embarrass his country is something I found especially true.  While in a Middle Eastern country I asked a young Ranger some questions to find out about some rumors.  He was extremely polite, and extremely professional.  Being in the Rangers is hard work.  It requires true dedication.  I'm impressed with the organization and the professionals within.

           Reading  urlLink  Jollyblogger's entry on "Another Sign of the Apocalypse" , he addresses the issue that if a church is in conflict, then there may be a lack of biblical expository preaching.  The preacher, as a messenger of God, has a tremendous responsibility.  But the amount of time that the preacher has to exposite the Word of God is limited.  The "drip method" of instruction is something that my wife and I use in our homeschool.  The  urlLink drip method  comes from an illustration where an Israeli  urlLink kibbutz  farmer saw that an orange tree was growing under a leaky faucet.  He later developed a drip system for irrigating the orange grove.  As the story goes, it was very successful.  I'm not sure if this story is true, but that's the way I heard it. I attempted to find the source but could not.  In our homeschool we have several subjects where we do a small amount each day.  For instance, we use a grammar text called "Daily Grams".  Little by little the kids have learned grammar.         The weekly Sunday morning sermon needs to be reinforced with other scripture intake.  The Scottish reformers took seriously the idea of family worship times.  More modern efforts have looked at personal devotions as being the answer.  Christian radio might have some role in putting the Word of God in people's daily life.  Small group Bible studies also can have an important role too.  By the way, the weekly sermon is the main event in the life of the church.  It's where we listen to God as His Word is preached.

      "Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid."  Matthew 5:14  ""Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him"  1 John 2:15  Today on the way to work I listened to a urlLink  radio story about Noi , a film about a Icelandic student who is trapped in his isolated village. The story mentioned that the father in the movie is an Elvis fan and " urlLink The Ghetto " figures big in expressing how the boy is caught.  Since I had just written about a Christian ghetto, I started thinking about another  urlLink ghetto  I had visited.  While in  urlLink Germany I visited the Juda Gasse in Worms .  Worms was as a part of the SWM; Spyer, Worms and Mainz, the three cities along the Rhein which had sizable Jewish populations.   I can't remember whether it is Yiddish or Hebrew but SWM means "onion".  The Juda Gasse was a Jewish Ghetto.  The Jews in Worms did not choose to live there. It was imposed upon them.  In contrast, the Christian ghetto is self-imposed.  One of the marks of the ghetto is containment.  In the Presley  song the young man turns angry from his environment. Our self-imposed containment need not make us angry.  If we step back from something in the mainstream culture, let us be pleased to do so and not be angry.  In other words, we need to maintain a sense of humor.  Humor is seeing the obvious in surprise form.  If you define humor you can't see it.  I don't think I'll be seeing the movie just because I doubt it's my genre.  At the same time, I thought about the Christian ghetto and wondered with it really existed and whether we could really engage our culture with the gospel message.  Oh,...its time to park and get out.

      A few years ago, Christian ghetto was a common term for the state of Christian books, music, radio and other media.  Searching the web on google , the term is still being used, I just don't hear it (read it) in my normal wanderings.  The term is complex and multifaceted, but one aspect of the concept is that Christians have attempted to create their own baptized versions of the worlds media and products in order to step out of the mainstream media.  The criticism is that these baptized versions of media lack creative excellence.  I think that some of that has changed.  Personally, I think Contemporary Christian Music ( urlLink CCM ) has improved (i.e. identified or deveoped more creative excellence) but the book market has gone down hill by over emphasizing trendy books.  Obviously romance is a Christian topic due to the inclusion of Song of Solomon in the scripture, but I don't believe that should give rise to the Christian romance novel industry in it's current form.  The  urlLink world wide web  has at times had its own ghetto effect, lack of creative excellence.  By and large Christians have emulated secular models.  The web in its early days was full of home grown web pages which showed personal interests and personal creativity.  Academic types produced quality pages to support their teaching function.  Then someone got the idea that they should make money on the web and for me, that is when a vast ghetto was created.  Instead of personal creativity being developed, broucherware became the norm.  Selling something, anything, everything became so pervasive that it's strident tones blocked out all other voices on the web.  Speaking of strident tone (webbing here) the other thing that shut down creativity was strident tones.  A large number of those who continued to create web pages were those who used strident tones in their communications.  With the advent of blogs, I see a new chapter for the web and for Christian use of the media.  We have a new opportunity for excellence in communication.  Blogs are really just content development and management systems, but they are text centric for the most part.  The Christian message is verbal vice visual.  While there is a place for Christian video, movies, etc..., the verbal media of blogs has tremendous potential for excellence in creative communication of the Christian message.

      " 4 Carry neither purse, nor scrip, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way. 5 And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house. 6 And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon it: if not, it shall turn to you again. 7 And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the labourer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house. 8 And into whatsoever city ye enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you:"  Luke 10:4-8 (KJV)  Talking yesterday, a woman mentioned that her church is debt free.  Her church is considering building an additional structure on their property and they intend to remain debt free.  Debt and real estate are common in the American church.  The church has a lot of its wealth tied up in real estate.  A years ago I read a book called  urlLink Problem of the Wineskins: Church Renewal in Technological Age  by Howard A. Snyder.  The writer advocated using the wealth of the church in other ways than building programs.  Having attended at least three churches which adopted this model, I see that ministry is often slowed down by not having a building.  The churches eventually out stayed their welcomes in school lunch rooms, and despite being a source of income for the school districts, they were asked to find another location.  The rental properties eventually had problems too.  While in the short term, investing in people rather than real estate seemed more "godly".  Finding the best use of funds, real estate or programs, is far from simple.  There is no one answer and individual churches must find individual answers to the problem.         There is a sense, when Christians seek to use modern communications tools to spread the gospel message, funding sources and means are not ideal either.  In the case of modern communication tools, rather than stating an ideal state, Christians merely adopt a funding model emulated on another organization.  Some of those organizations are so big and influential that people adopt the model by assuming the model rather than conscious evaluation and embraceable.  When using the Internet, do we allow click through advertisements?  Do we pay for the communication means through a line item from the church budget?        A few years back my family and I subscribed to a tape club put out by  urlLink Nest Entertainment .  They produced quality animated videos, at first on Bible stories and later on heroes of history.  Eventually they wanted to produce a movie and after they had almost completed the Swan Princess they were in financial trouble.  Another Christian video producer,  urlLink Big Idea Productions  who make the Veggie Tales, were solid financially until they attempted to leave the video sales and get into a full production movie.  I hope both have recovered, perhaps they have, but still the business model which they adopted was one that was different than how they had built their business.  Both are excellent communicators of a Christian message, but both needed to focus on what they do best and quit emulating larger media companies.  Success may have been their worst enemy.        One area that Christians pioneered in media and finance was creating the first infomercials.  I don't watch much Christian television any more but in the 80's when I did, some Christian programming on broadcast television was 80 - 90% pleas for giving.  This is one of the low points of the modern Christian use of media.       How do we finance our communications?  We have choices when we establish a new work, but when we inherit a ministry or business, it is really difficult to change the funding model in mid stream.  Paying off a debt may not be humanly possible with resources on hand.  We can depend on God month to month to pay the mortgage or we can depend on God for a single pay off.  Personally, I have tried to keep my debts to a minimum.  I paid for my cars from my savings.  The only major debt I have incurred after my wife and I got married is a mortgage.  It takes  dedication and principles to stay debt free.         Communication tools are expensive.  If we use them to spread the gospel, how do we pay for them.  Do we sell subscriptions to every kind of Internet information service possible?  Are click through ads really all that effective at funding quality content?  I respect the work of a couple of organizations.  One is MIT's  urlLink Open Courseware  project which publishes educational materials from their courses on line for free.  The other is  urlLink Crosswire Bible Society  which has produced such things as The SWORD Project.  Both this secular institution and volunteer Christian organization use another funding model than the normal one used.   I'm not saying I have all the answers.  I'm just saying that we need to make decisions about how we set up our finances when we attempt to communicate the gospel message.

      My good friend the  urlLink Jollyblogger  has inspired me by his blog.  I've been reading someone else's log, its not a blog because it was prior to the days of computers, but none the less it is a discussion his thoughts and life,  urlLink Augustine's Confessions .  If he could Augustine probably would have had a blog.  He would lead the bloggers.

              urlLink  Which one is your strongest Multiple Intelligence?      Linguistic   Gets a lot out of just reading text. Expresses in both speech and writing with much sense, clarity, effectiveness, efficiency, and insight. Makes a good writer and speaker.  urlLink        urlLink   Click Here to Take This Quiz     Brought to you by  urlLink  YouThink.com   quizzes and personality tests.       I think the test is right in regards to my leanings but I just can't cpeighl.  It's probably an ogrnazational thing.   I just finished scanning an article called the "Myth of Multiple Intelligence".  I looked it over  urlLink Barnes and Noble in the Inner Harbor . By the way, its a great place to hang out.  The author was an educator was pretty critical of the theory.  His premise was that the theory did not do much to change education except make for some strange methods of teaching on odd occasion.  He points out that all students need to learn spelling and physical ed regardless of their aptitude.  There is no reason to learn spelling with a squirt gun, Jello, and sand to make tactile spelling projects.  (Yes, I made that last one up.)  While this author was very critical of the idea of seven intelligences, I would like to say that teachers and other types of mentors can over look a child's strengths if they don't match the curriculum or the leanings of the teacher.  The theory might not do a lot to change teaching methods but it does allow teachers to step back for a second and to not be dismissive of students who do not fit their preferences or natural leanings.  A well rounded curriculum does include more than math and language skills. But at the same time we don't have to do silly things to teach simple things.  You know my motto: I love to learn.  Thanks  urlLink Jollyblogger  for pointing me to the quiz.

       urlLink Chris Seay  in  urlLink Stories of Emergence  juxtapositions propositional thinking and other ways of thinking, like web thinking or circular thinking.  He is right in thinking that there are other ways that people thinking about truth.  He points out that Ecclesiastes is circular in its line of thinking and he says that Proverbs is web thinking.  I agree that there is a level of literary sophistication in those books which is not easily caught in simple one liner summaries and the techniques of flash back are used.  I'm not sure I see a lack of linear thinking in the book of Proverbs.  There are topics that flow in my mind from proverb to proverb.  And perhaps Chris would observe the same flow from proverb to proverb.   I'm not sure we disagree so much as I think one does not have to throw away propositional truth in order to affirm the value of web or circular thinking.  On the other hand, one must acknowledge that linear thinking is an aid in expressing clarity of thought.  Web and circular thinking are about complex relationships and gaining the interest of our audience. The first attribute of complexity is essential in communicating the gospel.  People often test truth by seeing if it will hold up to the complexity of real-life.  It is sort of like difference between a laboratory test and testing something by using it in the real-world.  The second attribute if used as a stand alone function amounts to tickling the ears of the audience.  Story telling, proverbs, pithy sayings, and other communication techniques are good.  But placing the techniques ahead of truth is dangerous.  A story can be used to support many different points of view.  It all depends upon the details put in or left out.         One other point that Chris makes is that he affirms the Apostle's Creed.  I think one of the points of the emerging church movement is to leave behind one dimensional Christianity.  I affirm the goal of experiencing God in multiple dimensions : mind, will, etc...  One reason for shallow, one dimensional Christianity in America though is the creed that 'truth must always be boiled down to it's minimums'.  The lowest common denominator is helpful if one is simply looking for a starting point for beginning to cooperate.  It is a poor way to convince people that the scriptures have answers to life's problems.  I don't think Chris would be an advocate of simplistic answers.  But his affirmation of the Apostle's Creed is more of an effort to minimize flack from the traditional church and maintain connection with it.  The point of affirming the Apostle's Creed it seems to be intellectually safe.  That type of safety is what the emerging church seeks to leave behind.

           The Bible we have is not the original text.  I think the common notation for the original text is MS. I know of no scholar who believes that any of the ancient texts we have are original. Instead we believe some are copies of the original.  I believe the notation for copies of the original is MSS.  Few of the ancient manuscripts are MSS.  The manuscripts that we have, MSS, can not be copywritten in my humble opinion.  I'm sure the images of them are considered museum property.  Greek texts like the UBS are really a scholarly weighting of which of these public domain documents are closest to the original, since we don't have the original.  It would be nice to have the original text preserved by an objective, devote groups of scholars.  I think that is one function of groups like the United Bible Society.  The debate a couple years back on the gender sensitive translations makes me think that perhaps Bible societies may not be able to hold the line in preserving the text.  If Bible societies are unable, who then?   In a sense I don't want each individual denomination to do this work, nor do I want publishing houses like Zondervan to do it.  I believe the PCA is a great denomination because they have taken ministerial ordination seriously.  The place to hold back false doctrine is at the ordination examination.  The group of men who examine are a check against error.  How can this be done in preserving the original text?  Obviously we don't want to have doctrinal tests for those who are responsible for preserving the original text.          The  urlLink Jollyblogger talks about how some from the "emerging church"  are using alternatives to the traditional Bible.  While there is benefits to videos based on the Bible, illustrations of Bible stories, and other artistic works, in the end these are not the Word of God.  God choose to reveal himself and message via the written word.  That written word contains content that is of a certain nature.  God even forbids the use of images in representing himself.  The commandment which forbids images in one sense says that the content of our belief can not be conveyed via video, painting or visual art.  The content of the God revealed religion is verbal and must be conveyed in written and spoke word.  The words are not arbitrary either.  If someone retells the story of the three little pigs, I will not quibble with a rewording for the modern or post-modern. But it is possible to leave the original text and instead of translating the Bible, the person is writing a Bible story book.

       28 “What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’ 29 And he answered, ‘I will not,’ but afterward he changed his mind and went. 30 And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, ‘I go, sir,’ but did not go. 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?” They said, “The first.” Jesus said to them, “Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.   Matthew 21:28-32 (ESV)          I listened to this passage this on my Sony Walkman as I was riding my bicycle this morning.  (Soo early 80's! I should be using an ipod I know.)  I had never noticed that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go in before the chief priests and the elders.  I always thought in terms of the religious leaders not getting in at all.  Perhaps we should not read into the verbiage that they did or did not make it into the kingdom of God.  Because the next passage is about the  Parable of the Tenants  which points to the religious leaders being destroyed by their lack of faithfulness.  The real point of the  Parable of the Two Sons  is that the repentance of the tax collectors and prostitutes is an example for these religious leaders.        Those who have been to seminary or lifelong members of the church need to remember that those new to the faith are examples to them.  At least from the context of this parable, it is not the other way around.

      I'm still trying to figure out a little quandary.  How can a corporation like Zondervan, Holman, or Crossway copyright the Bible?  In one sense I see that they have an investment in the publication.  If they made it public domain all their competitors would benefit from the publication of the same scripture version.  At the same time, how can anyone own the rights to the Bible?  How can the United Bible Society own the original Greek and Hebrew?  Of course if you take away the revelatory nature of the book, its easy for me.  The real problem is that God has given us the Bible, so who can say that they own the publication rights to it?

      The  urlLink Jollyblogger wrote a blog on emerging church leaders who are critiquing the seeker sensitive model of worship .  If I get it straight, he is responding to a New York Times article on Alt-Worship: Christian Cool and the New Generation Gap.  The scripture talks about multigenerational praise for God.    Psalm 45:17 I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever.  Psalm 79:13 But we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will give thanks to you forever; from generation to generation we will recount your praise.  Psalm 102:18 Let this be recorded for a generation to come, so that a people yet to be created may praise the Lord:  Psalm 146:10  The Lord will reign forever, your God, O Zion, to all generations. Praise the Lord!  Daniel 4:34 At the end of the days I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven, and my reason returned to me, and I blessed the Most High, and praised and honored him who lives forever, for his dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom endures from generation to generation;   Teen rebellion does not have to be.  There are some real issues going during the teen years, but rebellion is sin regardless of human growth and development.  The idealization of youth rebellion opens the door for letting loose.  By the way, in many cultures, children do not have a separate culture from their parents.

      Reading the book of Nahum, I started thinking about his prophecy about the judgment to come on Nineveh.  He declares that their sin has caused of the coming doom.  I can see how if I were to declare some misfortune to be the result of sin, some people might think I was merely being opportunistic.  It is power flexing not declaration of the Word of God that they hear. I have heard a pastor talk about God leading him to start a building program.  I find it hard to believe that God was in it since there was no finishing of the project and the pastor left over moral issues.  God judges sin, but we have become hesitant to say there is any judgment in this life.  We postpone everything to the after life.  I see some of our national crisis as judgment which means we need to repent, but declaring that without sounding like a power hungry or delusional prophet is increasingly difficult.

      One of my family members was reading a commentary on Jonah.  The commentator gave following reasons why the Old Testament book of Jonah should be obviously considered a parable:  1.  Chapter 3 verse 2 says that Nineveh "was an exceedingly great city of three days journey".   The city has been excavated and shown to be three miles across.  2.  The short sermon having such a great effect is obviously hyperbole (3:4).  3.  The history of the region would have been much different had this event taken place.  I hold the Bible to be the inerrant Word of God.  That does not mean there are not difficulties.  To the first claim, I hold to the classic conservative position that the size is not a reference to the actual city walls but to the outlying areas too.  I grew up in a rural area and we always said we were from Lebanon but in reality we were 15 miles from the city line.  Right now I live in the Baltimore area, but in reality, I live in a suburb in the next county over.  Do I live in Baltimore?  The real answer is both yes and no.  It just depends which direction the conversation is taking which is correct.    To the claim that the sermon was too short to have such a great effect.  The ancient writers, not merely Biblical writers, generally summarized speeches.  (I forget which ancient historian of wars explained how he summarized the speeches of the generals.)  The message of John the Baptizer was not merely "Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand".  He had a few more things to say besides that is fairly obvious.  But as a summation of his message it is accurate.  In Act 2:40 the writer says "40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this untoward generation."  So the writer explains about Peter's sermon and we can conclude that he summarizes with the rest of the sermons also.    The final claim about the course of history being different sounds like the commentator is reading more into the "revival" than necessary.  Of course there is some truth that Assyria was not a worshippers of the God of Israel.  The repentance of Nineveh is apparently a short term thing that did not have lasting impact.  A lot of the nationalism that followed 9-11 has grown cold.  We are in the midst of war and people are taking our circumstances as common place.  Sort of funny.

I know the  urlLink Jollyblogger  does the Friday Five and so I've decided to do my own.  My five favorite radio stations:   urlLink WRBS  - 95.1 FM - Christian Radio in the Baltimore area.  Music is CCM.   urlLink WETA  - 90.9 FM - NPR news on the way to work.   urlLink Car Guys  on Saturday, and  urlLink A prairie Home Companion  on Sunday afternoon. Oh, yeah, Classical Music during the day. Washington D.C. station.   urlLink C-SPAN  - 90.1 FM - Congress, press briefing from the Pentagon, White House, etc... Strange that a bunch of gals and guys in suits could be so interesting.   urlLink KenRadio  - Technology news which only broadcasts on the Internet.  I wish I could listen in the car but I don't have the gear to play MP3s in the car.  His sponsor is Windows Media.     urlLink WNKJ  - 89.3 FM - A great hometown station in Hopkinsville, KY.  We used to listen to this station all the time when we lived at Ft. Campbell, KY.  I would love to hear anyone else's favorite stations.

      Years ago I read Peter Jenkin's book  urlLink Across China .  He describes how a common phrase used at American dinner tables really made America seem heartless.  The phrase was eat your dinner, there are many starving Chinese.  Jenkins described how a political officer interpreted that saying to mean that mothers were wanting to eat to ensure that the Chinese would starve.  Of course this sounds ridiculous to Americans, but there are times when a misunderstanding can not be set right.  The recent use of the photographs in the media to tell the story of the abuse of prisoners in Iraq could actually be a part of the degradation of the individuals who were photographed.  Often times victims of rape do not want to let it be known that they were abused.  In a sense our media might be adding to their shame.    Do we appear to be rubbing it in their faces when we put the photographs on television? (Even though that is not our intention.)  What do the photographs tell that legal terms like "sexual harassment", "sexual assault" and "sexual abuse" could not carry by way of content of the crime?  Rape is not a word that has been used to describe the abuse thus far, but the point is that there are a range of phrases that could be used in place of the photographs.  The military press release did not inflame the rage when it was originally released.  Just because the photographs exist does not mean they need to be published.

While the story is about the technology, I was a little more interested in the aspect of blogging on the move.  Are those blogs fresher?  Do they lack depth?

      Long story, short; I grew up in a small rural denomination church and have moved to a more conservative denomination.  I still have many good friends in that church.  Just to assure you, I'm not against my former denomination. My evolution from where I was to where I am is not a neat and organized story.  At times my heart longs for connections to my past.  But I'm glad the road that God has taken me down.   For a long time I was concerned that I had obligations to the denomination.  The people had supported me through some trials in my life.  They had provided scholarships for college and accepted my flailing attempts at ministry.  We had relationships and loyalties.    Due to my job, I moved from location to location.  I wish I had a more noble reason for moving denominations.  I was really in disagreement with the church's stand on the authority of scripture, abortion and the move away from the historic confession of faith.  So when the opportunity came to change denominations, I looked for a more Bible believing denomination.  I was not looking for the perfect denomination, instead I was looking for godly congregation where the Bible was preached.  That is not a bad thing to look for, but what I found was that the denomination does affect the local congregation.  I found that merely addressing the issue of Bible believing did not necessarily mean that the pastor knows how to interpret the Word and apply it to the here and now, nor does it mean that they read grace in the scripture.  If someone wants to participate in ministry, in the end you have to find a group with whom you can partner in ministry.  I will talk about some lessons learned from the various congregations and denominations I have been a part of.     Theological Definition  For a while I attended a great church.  When I asked the pastor how to solve a Bible interpretation problem I was basically told that it was not important passage.  In one sense, he was right, the passage was minor.  But my real question was how to interpret the scripture accurately.  A phrase that was the rule of thumb was, "Major on the majors and minor on the minors".  I really thought this was a good idea, but how do you determine which is which.  Obviously, my minor issue could be your major issue.  We do have to some how sort that out.  My desire was to preach the Word of God.  Do I just preach on "major topics"?  How does that fit with preaching the whole counsel of God?  Here I was in a Bible believing church, but I could not trust the theological position to competently handle the Word of God.  I did not leave that church, my work took me else where.   Lack of Oversite  For a while we lived overseas.  While there we attended a military chapel.  From one week to the next we got a lot of different chaplains.  One week we might have a Bible church chaplain, the next a Christian Scientist, and the next a liberal Lutheran.  We had some great Bible studies and fellowship, but a lack of Biblical standards really made for a rough ride.  We were not there a long time.  Since one of my friends was moving at the same time, we followed them in looking for a new church.   Legalism  When we came to the next church we found a pastor who could preach "like the house afire" (that means really well for those of you unfamiliar with the phrase, the "was" is left out for effect).  The congregation was small, Bible believing, had the ability to be decisive on theological issues, and had some good oversite mechanisms.  In the end though, they really missed the grace of God.  A subtle legalism governed the spiritual life of the church.  The pastor fell into some sin.  He ended up leaving the ministry. My wife ended up being very hurt by the environment.  I was working a lot so I was less effected by it.      Grace In Finding A Church  In attempting to find a church I relied on my own strength.  I thought I could find a church for my family through my own strength.  My method was that when I moved into a new area, I would find the best congregation.  I would meet someone who was godly, or call in the phone book.  I'm not saying that was an evil method, but I am saying that I was walking in my own strength.  When I moved the last time we were going through a difficult time.  We were hurt by our previous church.  We did not know which church to choose.  Instead of finding a church that I thought was a great church, we just went to church.  I did have some standards, but I felt inadequate to find the best church in the area.  God brought us to a church that is not perfect but they are Bible believing, have theological definition, have good oversite, and are dependent upon the grace of God.  I'm definitely not calling this a method of finding a church.  I was simply attempting to find a congregation to take my wife and children. I found a denomination that I trust.

      It is a much-repeated phrase that “Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.”  Most people take this statement at face value.  The idea is that one person likes one thing and another person likes something different.  And there are a lot of differences in taste of what people like.  But people’s preferences are not necessarily related to the idea of beauty.  In fact, people often prefer the edgy, dramatic and ugly over the beautiful.  Few people would argue that a rose is not beautiful.  I might like  urlLink Albert Durer ’s woodprints, but they are provocative and edgy, not beautiful in the same sense that a rose is beautiful.  Beauty is something that is easily recognized but is best not defined.  Rather than define what is beautiful, we describe what beautiful.  The difference between someone who recognizes true beauty and someone who does not is often a training issue, not merely a preference. As discussed in the  urlLink Wikipedia article on Beauty , a person who has mastered a discipline has a greater sense of what is beautiful than others.  For instance a carpenter easily sees a building that is out-of-true.  In fact they can discern a half a degree off, which is not the usual for the rest of us.  If you want to know what the ideal dog looks like, go to a dog show and talk to those who spend each weekend there.  As them about their about the best dogs at the show and be prepared for more information than you can handle.  I can’t prove beauty is real, nor is there a single objective standard.  But that is not the route to take in talking about aesthetics.  Since we can’t talk about a single objective standard,  urlLink aesthetics  is an oft-neglected field of endeavor by Christian theologians.  The failure to talk about this issue is to fail to connect where people live.

      At my daughter's sport banquet, a former football coach from Severna Park talked about making a list of 100 things to do before he died.  My wife and I are following his example by making our own lists.  To get to 100 things on the list has been a little bit of a challenge without throwing in weird things or things which are versions of the other.  What is the purpose?  I think for myself it is an effort to live life to the fullest.  An attempt to use the gifts God has given me to the fullest.  It is easy to select a movie.  A little harder to do something.  I read a book in my youth which explained that the ideal date to take a girl on was an active date and not a passive date.  A passive date would be something like watching a movie while an active date would be something like play table tennis.  Sometimes I find myself passive in life.  So I'm writing out a list of 100 things to do before I die.  Some may be unrealistic, but perhaps I will find out in preparing to make progress on the list, other things about life, myself and those I love.  These things are not in priority, nor is my list static or complete.  1.  Travel To  urlLink Tangier Island  I saw a PBS program on the history of the English language.  Tangier Island has an interesting dialect of English.  The isolation of the Island being in the Chesapeake has kept some older forms of language.  Since I'm language nut, this seems interesting.  2.  See a  urlLink Space Rocket Launch  As a kid of about five years old I wanted to be an astronaut.  I've sort of given up on the dream of going into space for some other ideas, but still space and technology are pretty cool.   3.   urlLink Bicycle Across The United States  I read a book by  David Lamb, Over the Hills: : A Midlife Escape Across America by Bicycle about his adventures of riding across America.  It seemed more doable than Peter Jenkins Walk Across America.

      The  urlLink Jollyblogger wrote a blog on Translation Issues II .  In it he discusses whether we should translate the scripture formal equivalents or use dynamic equivalents.  I’ll let you read his blog to get the difference.  In discussing the Jollyblogger’s blog on Translation Issue II, my good friend Keith asked, “How do we know what the meaning of the ancient words was any way”?  This is a good question because in talking about translating a text with either one, we still have to know what the words or text meant in the first place.   There was no ancient dictionary.  The first dictionary for English was published in A.D. 1656.  Dictionaries are relatively recent phenomena.  And besides, a dictionary’s authority is only as good as the academic scholarship work that was put into it.  Of course for the most part, we should not argue with the dictionary.  To address the issue, how do we determine word meaning from an ancient text?    1.	Word Usage In The Bible Text How words are used in a context helps us determine original meaning of the words.  Checking how the words are used in not only one context but also in similar contexts.  A concordance can be used to find how a word is used in various passages of the Bible.  We should not just check out the word, but also a phrase.    2.	Word Usage In Other Relevant Ancient Texts There are other ancient writings that we can look at.  For instance, the use of the phrase “works of the law” was not a common phrase, but from examining its usage in a document found with the Dead Sea Scrolls it is quite evident that it means a ceremonial righteousness.    3.	Ancient Translations Lastly we can look and see how the ancients translated the texts in their own day or in the centuries just following the writing of the scripture.   The  urlLink Hebrew Old Testament was translated into Greek  in the 3rd Century B.C.   There are also other ancient translations the Bible, like the  urlLink Syriac Version .  Then of course there is the  urlLink Vulgate  version.  These all add to our knowledge.    In the end, the name of the game is context, context and context.  That means that it is more art than science in determining word and phrase meaning.  At the same time, that does not mean that we don't know anything about the Bible's content.  To decide what a passage means, read it.  Context, context, and context.

      When I go out to eat, sometimes I order an entree that is unusual.  One time I ordered goat.  The waiter laughed at me.  I've had ostrich, alligator, and frog legs.  I like to explore geography with my stomach as well as my feet.  My wife read that most men order the same thing every time the go to a restaurant. I started asking around and indeed a lot of people order the same thing every time they return to a restaurant.  It isn't just men either.  People tell me that they don't want to take a risk of not liking something.  Others say that if they know what they like, why mix it up.    As we listen to the radio, we know what style we like so we select the station.  However, the DJ helps us out, he or she selects the particular songs.  (Well, actually the program manager.)  With the DJ mixing in new songs we get a little variety in with what we like.  With the advent of such things like the i-pod, I wonder if people will stick to what they like and in this way loose the introduction of new songs their listening.  If DJ's are taken out of the role of introducing new songs to a person, perhaps a database, much like Netflix and Amazon suggestions can do the same for music.    While I'm on the topic of music, if I've ever bought a vinyl, cassette, or 8-track of an album, shouldn't I be allowed to down load a legal copy from the record company.  Perhaps I could get a certificate if I mail in the original media.  I guess that would probably cost more than its worth.  But still, did I buy the medium or the recording?

      I listen to  urlLink C-SPAN  on the radio.  I think the Washington D.C. area is the only community that carries the programming through radio.  The format carries the Congressional meetings, DoD and Presidential press conferences, and the morning programming is often a discussion of news articles and such with the public via e-mail and telephone calls.  The programming is high end, despite decidedly non-spectacular way that it is presented.  News from the same press conference when carried by other news agencies is more edited and an interpretation.  I would propose that the Christian community needs a similar type of broadcast, perhaps on the Internet or perhaps on cable television.  While there are many good exceptions out there, the typical televangelist is more of an infomercial.  A lot of religious programming appeals to "a sense of self" rather than engage issues and community discussion.  I, for one, would like to see that change.

      The following are some of my thoughts on how to be a godly father.  How To Be A Godly Father   Read the following passages of scripture:   urlLink Exodus 20:1-17 ;  urlLink Matthew 5 :1-20;  urlLink Galatians 5   Define The Problem  	The question of how to be a godly father is not something we would normally hear outside the church.  You would probably think it is easy define what a father is, but in today’s society, that is probably harder than it should be.  What are some definitions of father today?  There are several approaches to this question; for instance, we could discuss what are the right things for a father to do.  (Provide financially for the family, stay with the children’s mother, remain sexually pure, attend church with the family, not being violent in the home.)  The main thing we want to address in this workshop is the role of a father in teaching godly character to his children.  The bottom line up front here is that you can’t do that, not without the help of God.  It takes a supernatural act of God to transform our beings, or in this case to transform your children.  Having said that, we still have a responsibility to teach our children godly character.  An hour and a half is not long enough to deal with this topic.  Hopefully we will spur you on toward your responsibility to teach your children to be godly.    	What does it mean to be godly?   The idea of godly character for the Christian is tied up in our ideas of morality.  We all have ideas that influences how we think about what is right and wrong.  Often these ideas are very under the surface, we are not articulate about them.  I’m willing to bet, oh wait, I might have just broken a moral principle that some of you are holding.   What I am talking about is different approaches to morality.     List of Do's and Don'ts   A simplistic version of morality is a list of Do's and Don'ts. Don’t smoke, dance or chew; or go with girls who do.  We teach this to our children when we don’t tell them why we have rules    Might Makes Right -    One approach is might makes right.  This idea says that if I’m able to enforce my will, or I’m powerful, or if I can get away with something, then its okay.  There are ways that we teach this, perhaps unintentionally.  When we tell our children that they are to do something because we are in charge.  We don’t have to only say we are in charge; we might communicate the same message through non-verbal communication.  If we as fathers rule the roost mere by our force of personality, then we can run the risk of creating an environment where something that I call card holding takes place.  What I mean by that, is the children don’t adopt our values, but they have a plan.  The plan is that if I wait, I’ll be out from my father’s rule.       Don’t Stump Your Toe Approach: Utilitarian – Mitigate Results   	This approach looks at the commandments in the Bible as merely God telling us not to stump our toe.  For instance, the command about not eating pork is explained as related to the disease triganosis found in hogs.  This is a parasite that is harmless if the pork is well cooked but if you eat under cooked pork you might catch this parasite.  While there may or may not be any connection between health and God’s command, people often look at God’s commands on the bases of God protecting us from bad outcomes.  Certainly there are connections between doing evil and judgment, sometimes brought on by an apparent earthly cause and effect relationship.  Once the cause and effect relationship is understood though, then one might figure out other ways to get around the effect.  Isn’t abortion an issue that is partly about mitigating effects caused by certain behaviors?  If we explain the prohibition in the OT about eating unclean animals as merely a health issue, and now we are more able to negotiate those health concerns, what about other commands.  We may teach utilitarian morality to our children when we use punishments as our sole means of instilling morality.     Norms (relativism) –  	Rather than talk about morality from a system of right and wrong, some people look at what is accepted and rejected by the group.  The person who holds to this type of morality sees world as something might be right in one setting and not right in another.  We teach this to our children when we have practices in the home that we change when other people come to visit our homes.  I have found in Arab society that if the group does not know something, it is fair game.     Rights –   	“We hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal, endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights.”  What rights to we have?  Some parents tell their kids that they need to stick up for themselves.  Not only do we teach this by our words but also how we deal with customer service at the store.     Virtue –   	A virtue is an ideal type of behavior.  One is not merely not stealing, but also respecting the property rights of others.  Attempting to find the owner of a lost item.  And virtues also manifest themselves in not    Teach Children a multideminsional Picture   Children adopt a lot of these ideas from our actions, and can have an inmature view of morality.  So when we teach we need to ensure that they progress from stage to the next in their moral development.  This means having a Biblical worldview regarding morality.  Unlike philosophers how argue one theory over another, the Bible sees morality as a multideminsional picture.  The Bible does not teach simplistic one aspect of morality, but teaches propositional truth about morality.  It teaches rules and teaches virtues.  It teaches that there is judgement, and God is the ultimate power.  In that sense and that sense only, might makes right.  The key is to have good in the might and only God is good.  The scripture teaches that even when "the Gentiles who have not the law, do by nature what is in the law, they are a law unto themselves".  In a sense, even moral relativism has an aspect that is positive.  The Gentiles in this way find out their need for grace by entering the "school house of the law" and find their need for a gracious savior through that school house.     E-mail From My Friend Scott.....   Terry   I wanted to post this on your blog but was unable to because the comments must be under 1000 characters. So maybe you can post it.   I enjoyed the topic on how to be a Godly father. About 15 into the talk I was not sure how this was going to end up, but at the end it all came togeather. I loved the part about posting the 10 commandments in the house. Last night when I was saying good night to Steven he was asking why I went away this weekend and I told him I learned from other men in the church on how to be a Godly man, father and husband. So I started to talk about the 10 commandments to him. I asked him if he new any of them he said I think so. So we started with the one that gets him in the most trouble “Honor thy father and thy mother” We read the commandment together then we talked about it for about 5 min. He was excited to listen on what I had to say about this. I was trying to talk to him like a 5 year old and this helped, he said” he would try to do what this commandment says and if he is having problems with this he would ask Jesus for help”.So going back to the basic with your children is great starting place instead of saying “do as I say not as I do” “do as the bible says and has Jesus has done”….Thank you Terry.

           I was asked to write a blog on cats.  So here it goes.     urlLink Cats ! I don't have one.  I used to have one.  But that was really my fault.  But back on topic here, blogging tools such as Blogger, are really about content management systems and easy content creation.   urlLink Cats  on the other hand are content creators.   urlLink Cats  are cool because if you really don't know what to write about on a blog you can always write about your  urlLink cat .         I guess I could write about other  urlLink cats  in the neighborhood since I don't have my  urlLink cat .  But actually I like writing about theology, communication, and ideas.  I know ideas are not as cuddly as  urlLink cats , but then again,  urlLink cats  are not as intriguing as ideas.

      During the Vietnam era, the U.S. Army started something call a  urlLink Civil Affairs  unit.  The unit's job was build or develop infrastructure for the villages in Vietnam.  While doing these projects, like drilling wells, health clinics, and schools, the Civil Affairs unit would look to win the hearts and minds of the local population.   I'm convinced the church likewise needs a conscious effort to win hearts and minds but not only providing some sort of social service but also employee other deliberate methods of engaging the culture.  My hypothesis is that each church needs to incorporate the five different elements in order for the congregation as a whole to engage the local community; Mercy Ministry, Apologetics, Evangelism Training, Media Ministry and Arts Ministry.  Not each of these needs to have a separate committee or organizational structure.  For instance, a man named Smith in my church functions as the resident apologist, (besides my fine pastor of course).  A church choir may function as the Arts Ministry with out ever thinking that it is doing this.  Justifying each of these as Biblical category would be difficult, but none the less we see elements of all these in the scriptures.  I would view these thoughts as a strategy and not theology.  I do have some theological perspectives which helped develop these five in my thinking, but these are  not  universals for all churches in all cultures for all ages, but merely food for thought.     Mercy Ministry  - My belief is that all churches should have some ministry to meet practical needs, whether it is feeding the Hebraic and Hellenistic widow (from the book of Acts) or building homes for the poor.  Other options are include educational ministries, food assistance, drug rehabilitation, counseling and health clinics.  Each church needs to do this in order to show love visibly.     Apologetics  - The modern church has many competitors for the hearts.  Some of these are false teachers.  While it is possible to see a false teacher behind every magazine article and sermon, we must be careful to address doctrinal issues without attacking everyone and everything.  There should be some sort of help available in every congregation for people attempting sort out the ideas of the cults and modern trends, such as The Da Vinci Fiasco.  Each church needs to do this in order to fight for the faith and so individuals do not fall victim to the enemy.   Evangelism Training  - The general statistic from Evangelism Explosion International is that only about 10-15% of a congregation can really handle EE training.  I would agree its not for everyone, but without that 10 - 15% you have a congregation who is by and large inarticulate about their faith.  Without a solid core group who can explain the gospel message, the things done to win hearts and minds becomes unclear why it is done.  Each church needs to do this in order to have a genuine grass roots expression of the faith.   Media  - There are so many means of communicating today, mass media and personal media.  The church can re-enforce its message through the use of good media resources.  Ideas for this are tapes, websites, literature, e-mail lists, radio programs, lending libraries, CD's of the church choir or praise group, and a host of other things.  These should be used to share with visitors.  Each church needs to do this in order to make their massage accessible.   Arts  - Every church should have people who express their message creatively.  This has many forms also, from decorators to singers, from craft artists to thespians.  While this does not have to be fine arts centric, it must show competence in the expression and refinement in message.  Each church needs to do this in order to show creative and lively expression of their message.

      I took another Myers Briggs test in the early 90's.  I got the same profile.  Visionary is something that is pretty overt in my leanings without a test telling me so.  Hat tip to  urlLink Rebecca Writes  for the test.              ENTP  - "Inventor". Enthusiastic interest in everything and always sensitive to possibilities. Non-conformist and innovative. 3.2% of the total population.

      My DSL line is back up.  For those of you who visit, that means I can blog at will.  Turns out an old wire broke when it was moved slightly.  The cost of repair was one hand crafted garden stone with butterflys on it.  That's a long story but my advise is to keep lots of garden stones around for such repairs.  Butterflys are particularly interesting.

      	Futurology is a study of current trends in technology or society and how those trends will play out.  Writer's like  urlLink Alvin Toffler  in Future Shock and Power Shift take an academic look at the possibilities of the what is the logical conclusions to certain trend that can be observed.  The trend is usually predicted to continue when it comes to technology and social change.  Some futurologists would predict that technology like the bar code and scanner system in grocery stores will expand to be included in you future kitchen so that the  urlLink grocery list can be automated .  You could keep an accurate inventory of your refrigerator and cupboard contents in a object-oriented database which would tie into you budget software, create a grocery list, perhaps order the groceries for pick or delivery and finally create a health index report based on the diet you have eaten the past week, month or year.  Or talking about a social trend, the success of Internet dating services has inspired attempt to build other  urlLink social networks  on the Internet.  And of course we are talking in this case about the success of the social trend of meeting people on-line, not the technology which creates the social opportunity.  When the trend involves the environment or natural resources the analysis is usually pessimistic.  There are usually equations which show the current or the predicted exponential rate of consumption and the known amount of that particular resource which yields the date that the resource will be depleted.  The obvious example of this our modern dependence on fossil fuels.  In general, predictions about technology and social trends tend to be optimistic while predictions about the environment tend to be pessimistic.  The most notable exception to this is the Y2K problem which created an artificial resource problem, the lack of a large enough date field.  While the equation to describe the similar limits to social trends and technological advancement would be more complex and perhaps defy quantization, these limits are often overlooked.  The reason for optimism is not so much the facts and equations but  motivation of the speaker to put forth a new idea.  In sense the speaker can speak positively so that his prediction is a self fulfilling prophecy.  There are at least three types of self fulfilling prophecy, the ancient Greeks thought of self fulfilling prophecy as a prophecy spoken which caused people to react to the prophecy in order to defeat the prophecy.  The classic example is the story of  urlLink Oedipus  who is sent away to be killed because of a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother.  The his parent's, Laius and Jocasta, effort to avoid this great evil are the very actions which set the stage for the event prophesied.  The servant can not bear to kill the child and gives him to a shepherd.  The child is eventual adopted by Polybus.  When Oedipus hears another prophecy that he would kill his father he leaves the town so as to avoid the evil of killing Polybus and ends up meeting his biological father, Laius, on the road and kills him.  This type of self fulfilling prophecy is capricious and ironic; the product of fate.  There is a type of self fulfilling prophecy in the scripture where a prophet makes a prediction and the people of God respond to that prophecy.  For instance, when Abram was promised the land, it caused generations after him to keep their focus on their possession of that land.  The prophecy kept the people of God looking to the divine promise and its fulfillment.  The third type of prophecy is the more modern type.  A business leader or a social activist can talk about a vision and the shifting of paradigms.  They declare that a trend is going to happen and people respond, if they see validity in the claim by adopting the trend.  Sometimes people understand their vision and that they are shaping the market place of ideas by their declarations, at other times the person is unaware of the process they are spawning.  The Emerging Church was one of the themes of this year's  urlLink National Pastors Convention  in San Diego, CA.   While the ideas of the Emerging Church are as varied as the players, the basic premise is that the post-modern church is re-inventing itself into a new form.  The movement declares that its communication style, church structure and theology are quite different from the modern church of the 20th century.  My postings will not examine whether those who are declaring a new age of the church are self-aware in an attempt at self-fulfilling prophecy.  However, I will not assume that movement will necessarily continue in growth simply because it has been declared.  There are limiting factors to which are likely undiscovered about the movement and of course equations by social scientist who study religion are premature at this point.   On the other hand, a forum as large as the National Pastors Convention is really too big to allow the church to be dismissive of the trend even if the declaration that a new form of the church is emerging smacks of a type of certainty that is usually avoided by the movement as a whole.   Certain criticisms of modernity have merit, and where the modern church adopted unbiblical positions from the philosophy of modernism, we are to repent of the error.  The Emerging Church emphasizes being authentic, organic and genuine, which are all fine qualities, but these all speak about a theology of revelation and sometimes as applied by the movement are in contradiction to that of scripture. I will share in future posts, pun intended, some of my thoughts on such.

      I've been reading  urlLink Beowulf .  I read the Michael Crichton's version of Beowulf, urlLink  Eater's Of the Dead  a few years ago.  While I can see the correlations between Crichton's book and Beowulf, they really quite different and I really like the original better.  I am impressed by the character development, who Beowulf is.  A lot is left unsaid.  Not like a modern novel.  The flow of the story is not exactly clear or linear.  The themes though are noble and inspiring.  We don't write poetry like Beowulf today.  Perhaps we can not, but I would say we need to do so.  One of my daughters said that Beowulf is the first Christian fantasy.  I would not disagree.  It does have fantasy themes, dragon's and warriors.  However, I don't get the same feel from the story as from other fantasy.

      Comments on the  urlLink Jollyblogger  made think about the gender roles in church.  He was talking about the marginalization men in the church.  I think there is a tendency to marginalize either men or women.  In the church that I grew up in, men were marginalized, women were the real power center of the church.  In my current church, I see a problem that women are sometimes marginalized, not by design, but by insecurity.  Since we do not allow women to teach men or serve as officers, women know that there are limits what they can do.  Instead of recognizing that they can serve in almost any other fashion, they tend to be hesitant in doing many other things.  I'm not sure how to solve the problem.  Neither gender should feel marginalized, or should I say, be marginalized.  If a church allows for women officers, men are often marginalized.  The usual way that I see to keep women from being marginalized in an all male leadership church is to have a women's ministry which has a separate but not so equal status.  This separate organization within the church serves as an outlet for women's leadership gifts.  I'm not sure that is the answer in more modern churches since this is less palatable to younger women, they are used to leadership in the work place.  Answers and suggestions to the question welcome.

      I just got through taking the class called Introduction to Reformed Theology.  There we discussed the nature of God, that he was independent which is in contrast to man.  God does not need creation to exist.  Growing up I was always taught the theology of choice.  That is, we are being called by God to choose him and if we will only make the choice, we will be saved.  I believed this up until I found the logical limits of determinism.  Determinism comes in many forms: biological determinism (we make our choices based on our biological programming), chemical determinism (we make our choices based on the chemical process in our body), and psychological determinism (our choices are determined based on the psychological motivations).  In a sense this type of thinking started breaking down my idea of a theology of choice.  I did not adopt determinism but I starting thinking about the logical conclusions of choice.  I started thinking about the limits of choice in each person's life.  Teachers will say things like, "You can be anything that you want to be."  It is good to inspire children to their own potential.  However, there are limits to human ability.  I found that in my career choices, I really did not have that many options.  In many things in my life, I had few choices.  I was not only limited by my own hard work, talents, and attitudes; I was also limited by the environment that I was living within.  The very context I was living within had limits.  If there was so many things limiting my choices how is it that God would use the freedom of the will to save mankind's souls.   This past week in looking at the nature of man, he is inherently dependent upon God for his physical subsistence.  We constantly need food, sleep, warmth, and a host of other things to keep us healthy.  Adam and Eve were dependent in their nature to eat and sleep just as we are.  If God made us so dependent upon him for our physical natures, how is it that he would make us independent in the area of our will?  Long story, short.  Our will is dependent upon the grace of God, just like our physical body is dependent upon God's common grace.

             Several years ago I was wondering around the library in Munich, Germany.  Frankly, I was looking for free Internet access so I could e-mail my wife back in The States more cheaply than the  urlLink Internet Cafe  that I had been using.  Of course most of the books were in German and clearly out of my league.  But as I got to the Religion section, I found a book  of Martin Luther's tracts that he had written and printed.  The printing jobs were beautiful by the way.  While most of the book was Luther's German tracts, the introduction was in English.  The printing press was a new invention and the tract was the new media for religious expression.  I had not thought of the tract as important to the history Reformation as a movement but the book made the case for just that.  Notice how many times in the following article on  urlLink Luther  the word tract is used.           This week I took a class with  urlLink Dr. Powell  on Introduction to Reformed Theology.  I forget the context, but during the class he said, "A call to preach is a call to write".  He mentioned that on his  urlLink own church's website  he publishes sermons both audio and text.  I usually think of preaching as a spoken communication art.  But I could see how a pulpit ministry would be enhanced by having printed copies of select or all sermons.  Perhaps the tract is not a dead medium but a solid one, perhaps it just needs a new face.  In Luther's day, person could speak in a new way to influence many.  The blog allows the small pulpit to speak to a wider audience. Luther printed his tracts, should every preacher have his website and blog?  Has the pulpit ministry made a turn?         My wife and I attended  urlLink Calvary Chapel of Monterey Bay  and the sermon tape library was taken very seriously.  The pastor preached through the Bible expositorially and so when someone missed a Sunday people really wanted to listen to the part they missed. I think part of the success was that the medium of cassette tapes was still in vogue.  Tapes are less popular today but still used.  MP3 files are not quite reached a critical mass as a medium, there are a few people out there with i-pods.  The medium that has the most players is probably the CD, but I have not seen a rapid reproduction machine for CD's like we have for cassette tapes.         Dr. Powell said his comment is not exactly original, but a variation on the theologian  urlLink Turretin 's comments on the apostle's call to preach was a call to write down the New Testament books.

      Recently a lady at church asked me about the Da Vinci Code.  One of her relatives had criticised her Christian faith by referencing The Da Vinci Code.  In one since he was using a fictional account to attack the Christian faith.     urlLink Christian History  magazine did a good write up on the Da Vinci Code from the point of view of history.  I highly recommend their article.    The organzization  urlLink Answers In Genisis  gives a good answer on the formation of the Bible in relation to the Da Vinci Code.    The  urlLink Tekton site has a review  of the Da Vinci Code but is a little involved.    So that is three different approaches to answering the novel.

      Let me start out by saying, I offer the following musings in a friendly tone.  Discussion of the nature of the Bible (translation authority and text preservation) should be encouraged.  Those who are not willing to discuss it perhaps don't know exactly what they are defending.  I see the recent posting on  urlLink Parablmania  as a health examination of the topic.    There is a phrase used when someone is recommending a theological related work that is technical and difficult.  The person will say something along the lines of, "This is not something you are going to use in your  urlLink devotions ".  The message is that the rightful audience and use of the textbook or theological treatise is NOT the common Christian in private worship.  The larger context, the person is saying that the heavy book should not be used to intimidate Christians who will not or can not appreciate the more detail nuanced expression of theology.  Also, the speaker might be indicating that those who do have a grasp of the more technical aspects of the faith should not take themselves too seriously and become puffed up with pride.  The turn of phrase is used as a light hearted way to keep our sinful tendencies in check.    Jeremy Pierce, recently mentioned his thoughts that paraphrases versions of the Bible are acceptable for use devotions.  (Oh by the way, I wanted to link to Jeremy's blog, but I'm not sure what it is. Is he Parablemania?)  He defined devotions as reading those books which have a passage or verse of the Bible and a short message to help the reader appreciate the text.  I have used these types of books quite a bit.  I have found them very helpful, even foundational to my early walk with Christ.  I think a key element to the genre is that it is short enough to read through in a comfortable, single sitting.  Often, perhaps even of this genre is warm in its emotional tone.  It elicits an emotional response from the reader with a relevant issue or touching story.  Often the writing is very personal in nature, addressing the reader directly.    Okay, there is a genre of literature out there designed for devotional reading.  That is true, but I think the literature follows the practice of private worship.  That is the Christian worshiping God alone in private prayer and private Bible reading.  Private worship is something each Christian should do.  The genre of literature follows the need to make this practice not to be burdensome (too long) and keep motivation of the Christian high.  Thus the length and personal, emotional nature of the content.  Jeremy Pierce is not the only one to tell me that paraphrase versions are acceptable for devotional reading.  While in one sense I'm not totally against paraphrase versions of the Bible, I'm hesitant to agree that they are acceptable for devotional reading.  Getting away from the concept of devotions being short and addressing personal needs, I propose that devotions should be really thought of as private worship.  Our worship is something we do to honor God, not find self fulfillment. Often my motivation is false and self-seeking, however, the Holy Spirit is the true empowerment that allows me worship from the heart.  I'm not saying that private worship should be boring, a trial, stuffy and impersonal.  However if one focuses on self, he or she is not focusing on God.  Worship should be when we hear from God, He speaks in His Word.  In public worship it is in the public reading of the scriptures and preaching of the Word.  In private worship we listen to God by reading, studying, listening, singing, memorizing, meditating on the Bible.  He does speak to us.  When He speaks, it is authoritative.  Paraphrases are never considered authoritative, even by those who created them.  One should know that the Living Bible was very important in my walk with the Lord early on, and I'm grateful for how God used it in my life.  However, to me, the rightful place of a paraphrase is sort of like a commentary.  It is a rewording of the Bible in vernacular in order to explain the text.  It is not the Word of God.  My conviction is that we should use a solid translation for private worship.

      Just read about the Alexander the Great. He struggled greatly to maintain the loyalty and motivation of his men.  He ultimately could not gain their motivation when they saw no end to his appetite for conquest but he could use his own personal example to drive the group.  He took enormous risks in order to achieve.  His risk taking ultimately set the stage for his demise.    The thing that distinguishes the excellent athlete or warrior from the average is a determination which causes them to take themselves to the very limits of their abilities.    In the movie miracle which chronicles the U.S. hockey teams efforts to beat the Russian team, the coach pushes the team to be the best conditioned.  "Legs feed the wolf", is his motto and so the athletes skate until they are all skated out.  Injury and trouble does not mean quit.  There is a time to count the costs, but if the cause is righteous and blessed from heaven then there is no stopping.  I know working in the kingdom of God is different than competing in athletics or on the battlefield.  However, pushing myself to my limits is exactly what I need to be able to do.    "I press on to the prize..."

      The  urlLink Jollyblogger  tipped me off to Parablemania's  urlLink review of Bible Translations .  A while back one of my family member's wanted to know if the New King James Version was a good version. I see several criteria for selecting a Bible translation.   These are similar to, but not identical to, Parablemania's criteria.      1.   Faithfulness to the original text  -  In a sense I would guide people away from using paraphrases.  There is a part of me that says, let's just quit the whole attempt at paraphrasing.   However I have to think about my own walk with the Lord.  He used The Living Bible, a paraphrase, to draw me nigh to him.  While I really liked Parablemania's article, I really don't understand using a paraphrase during a devotional reading.  I think there is a sense that people want to connect more on an emotional level with the scriptures during devotions.  I hold that there should be whole person engagement in devotional readings, engage all faculties; mind, will, emotions, spirit, soul, etc...       2.   Reading Level  - Bibles have different reading levels.  If someone has trouble reading, they should pick a Bible that has a lower reading level.  If you have trouble with this one, you should probably ask someone to help you.  Take their suggested Bible translation, sit down and read three chapters from the four gospels.  If it feels difficult, try another translation that is easier.  If you think you might appreciate a more challenging text, pick up the New American Standard Version (NASV) or the English Standard Version (ESV).  Then do the three chapters in one sitting test.  It's sort of like trying on a pair of jeans.         3.   No Theological Agenda  - The translators should focus on being faithful to the original text and not their church's theology.  This is difficult to do.  The New International Version and several other modern translations selected translators from several denominations in an effort to check one another.  The New World Translation is driven by theological agendas.  Someone pointed out to me that my criteria is not friendly to Catholic translations.  Well, okay, I'm Presbyterian (PCA) and I would not recommend a Catholic version to any one, but I'm not throwing stones at them.  I have a great deal of respect for the Catholic scholars I have read.  While publishing houses have taken on the job of gathering a group of translators, I prefer that a Bible Society do this work.  This organizational structure is somewhat independent.  Organizationally this is preferred, however, the ESV is a response to a group attempting to make gender neutral language a translation standard.  I have to say that my preference for Bible Societies has been challenged by these events.          4.   Selection Of Original Text  - Though it has died down somewhat in recent years, there has been a big debate over the King James Version (KJV).  While I can not treat this debate with fairness here, let me say this, one foundational issue for the advocates KJV point is use of the best original text.  Textual criticism is not an easy discipline.  At the risk of over simplifying, there are two schools of thought in textual criticism.  One says we should use the received text, also known as  Textus Receptus .  Those who advocate  Textus Receptus  point out that we should not use the oldest text but the one that was used most by the church.  In their way of thinking it was used because it was reliable.  The other school of thought looks at a modern scholar or set of scholars who examine all the texts that are out there and select the one they are convinced is the original.  Sometimes the selection of a text comes down to a vote.  (Bible by committee does not sound like revelation but politics.)  Personally, I am a part of the school of thought which appreciates scholars examining all the texts.  I used both the United Bible Society (UBS) text and like texts.  I use  Textus Receptus  on computer because it is free but that is not my preference.         5.   Public Reading  - The translation one selects is something of a choice, I would be very careful about making one translation the official translation.  However, there is a sense that public reading of the scriptures is one important means of experiencing the scriptures.  For this to be the most helpful, the translation should be authoritative and clearly understood from public reading.     Pastoral Responsibility   The textual criticism is not for the average layman.  Most people in the pew want the pastors and Bible scholars to hand them a trustworthy text.  This is as it should be.  When we put textual criticism in the arena of the lowest common denominator we get some strange things.  In my humble opinion, the KJV only crowd do some real over simplification for convince sake.  The position that they take is one laymen can comprehend because it solves all the complexities of textual criticism in one fell swoop.  Textual criticism in my opinion must be tackled one text at a time.  There should be two levels of expertise that are needed.  The first is the scholars who translate the scriptures must be competent in this technical field.  The second is that of the normal pastor who preaches in the pulpit.  He need not be an expert on the same level as the professional scholar, however, he should, as a part of preparing for the message study, understand textual issues in the passage.  (You can see my thinly veiled preference for expository preaching.)  Like issues of original language usage and technical issues of historical context, he should know the issues well, use them to clarify his own understanding of scripture and bring depth to his own grasp of the scripture.  While he should understand the textual issues very well, he should hardly ever or possibly never mention directly textual criticism issues from the pulpit.  Pastors have a great deal of responsibility in explaining the text of the Bible and preserving the text.  This can not be outsourced to Princeton or the United Bible Society.  I know this is a difficult issue to deal with when pastors are going to get little or no interest from their congregation on the issue, but none the less, pastors are responsible not only to explain the Word, but evaluate the work of scholars.

      I have decided to change this to a more positive title.  I have been posting my goals a few at a time and calling it 100 thing to do before I die.  Our death will happen, but perhaps it sounds a little dark to put it in the goals.     7  Connect GIS and Ministry   I would like to connect ministries with the tools of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) like  urlLink ArcView .  The idea is that Christian ministries could identify community needs and plan strategies for expansion of the kingdom of God through GIS.   8  Create a project for open source pastor software   Pastors in the developing world could use high quality software for their ministry.  I would like to see an  urlLink open source  or a free software project to help pastors of small congregations in the third world.     9  Publish a Bible gazetteer   Rather than publish a book, I would like to publish a whole database.  I've started on this one a little more than the other two.  Check out my webpage on the place names in the  urlLink four gospels .

      Relationships are fundamental to godliness in my understanding of true piety.  The New Testament has a lot to say about relationships in families, the work place and the church.  Relationships are important to my understanding of practical theology.  In order to pass down ministry skills, I believe the New Testament teaches doing it through relationships.  While these ideas are very important to me, I find myself a relationship klutz.  (I'm really not sure I'm worse than the next guy or gal, but in relationship to the ideal expressed in the Bible, I'm a KLUTZ.)  So when I notice something about people, it may be common sense for others but a revelation for myself.   Recently I have been noticing people making decisions based on their relationships and others who make decisions based on goals.  I'm not sure that the two categories are really universal, but seeing this has helped me to understand people who are not goal oriented.  I would put myself as much more goal oriented.  I have had a difficult time figuring out those who make decisions based on relationships.  One of my children seems to make a lot of her decisions based on how it would affect others in her life.  (i.e. I'll not do this or that because it might hurt someone's feelings.)  Another one of my children is much more goal oriented.  She makes decisions based on the end state, but I still see her give a lot of consideration to relationships.  I was confused at certain decisions being made and so I started asking about their motivations.  It seems my children taught me that not everyone is wired the same way that I am.  I had always considered that there were two criteria that people used for decisions: objective, rational criteria and the other was subjective self interest.  I had not considered that there was the more subjective criteria of how others would perceive or be affected by a decision.  I put this in the subjective side because sometimes I've seen the decision based on what the person would anticipate the other person would feel, not actually what they would feel.   I started examining how people, adults and children, were making their decisions.  I found a lot of adults who are relationship oriented in their decisions.  So if the relationships around them do not address the decision, then the decision does not get made.  I have often found myself in the role of helping people decide what they want in regard to career, ministry and other things.  When they were indecisive I always considered it a issue of the thought life.  Now I find out that it might be an issue of the relationships in their life.

      Pat Tillman was killed by "friendly fire".  As I understand it, it was an accident.  By the way, it makes him no less of a hero in my humble opinion.  Friendly fire incidents are also known as fratricide.  The Army teaches soldiers how to fight side by side.  When one digs a foxhole, one of the considerations is who and where are the soldiers to the left and to the right.  The idea is that you don't want inadvertently shoot the soldier to the left or right of your position.  Likewise, you don't want them to shoot you either.  This is not only true of individuals, but also true of each unit.  The platoon needs to know which platoons to the left and right of its own position.  The same is true of each larger unit too; company, battalion, brigade, division, etc...  The idea is to reduce fratricide and work as a team.  Even when people are doing all the right things fratricide still occurs.  Reading  urlLink "Stories of Emergence " I noticed that a lot of the issues are about hurt and angst.  It seems from the tones that they are victims of friendly fire and at times they they too turn their weapons to toward their brothers.  I'm guessing that they are not aware that they are doing this.  I'm not sure of the answer of how to help without making it worse.

      We shut down our room with our internet connection in order to paint.  My wife and daughters have worked hard.  I've tried to help during the evenings.  My book during the evening has been a book by a post-modern man who makes a religious pilgrimage.  He walks on a ancient road to Santiago.  He spends a lot of time explaining that he is not a religious sort of guy, but he is none the less, taking a pilgrimage.    One of the interesting points of the book is the fact that in the Middle Ages people on a pilgrimage had an international status.  Pilgrims had special rights.  They had special clothes which identified them as pilgrims.  There were laws against impersonating a pilgrim.  Today we take vacations, not pilgrimages.  Vacations are about relaxation, pigrimages are about discovery and dedication.  A book I read many years ago was  urlLink Walk Across America .  The author  urlLink Peter Jenkins  walked with a purpose of discovery.  As he walked it was a discovery of his country.  Peter Jenkins walked part of the Appalachian Trail on his walk.  The Appalachian Trail of course is the great American unattainable hike.  Most people don't make it.   urlLink Bill Bryson 's book,  urlLink A Walk In The Woods  actually was about walking just parts of the Appalachian Trail.  Walking the whole Appalachian Trail was just too much really do.    I'm trying to plan my own sort of walk.  I don't have a quest or a destination, but I know I want to do this.  Any suggestions are welcome.

      In 1987 I was facing a decision to become a student pastor at a country church or re-enlist in the U.S. Army.  The decision was very tough since I really wanted to become a pastor, and still do, but I just felt led of God away from that particular ministry.  So I re-enlisted, not knowing just exactly what to do.  The Army gave me a little bonus money for that decision.  Sort of a consolation prize to myself I decided to buy a computer with that money.  I had been using an Apple II at the library.  I did some research and asked around about what type of computer was best for education.  The answer resoundingly was Apple.  I was also taking a course on computing for my degree program.  It was an introduction to computing.  It was a computer course on the computer.  There was a lab assistant there who ran the place.  When he was not watching the computer lab, he taught computers.  Everything pointed to the type of computer that I wanted was an Apple.  This decision started me down that path.  I did not know it at the time, I was becoming a computing rebel.    In the next few years, people would be buy computers like crazy and most of them would be asking a different question than I was.  I was asking about the best design for a particular job.  They were asking, what do I know already about computing.  Come to think of it, one of the first computers I ever worked on at my job was an Apple.  It was my introduction to this feild which has become so much a part of my life.  So I went to my local post exchange (PX) and bought my first Apple II GS.  I kept it running for much longer than I should have.  My experince with computers was much different than the typical computer owner in the late 1980's, early 1990's.  While everyone else was learning DOS and later Windows, I was learning how to program in BASIC and trying to figure out why I had fewer software choices than my Windows counterparts.  I went to Apple User Groups a few times and bought a lot of magazines on Apple II.  I really did not understand why everyone was attracted to computers which were built for business and less for home use.  It seemed to me at the time that the market driving forces were simply wrong.  Buy a computer built for your needs.  However, I think computer education was driven for most user by their work environment.  The key factor was not design and features, but how comfortable people felt about a system.  They used computers at work and those are the systems they knew something about.  If they had a problem at home, they could ask somebody at work about the issue.  Instead of going to a user group, the water cooler became the  de fato  user group in the work place.  Eventually all my friends were talking about reloading their system over and over again all the while I was espousing the philosophical merits of my system.  My bottom line, pick the best designed system.  The herd's bottom line, don't leave the herd, its safer that way.  When I was not using a Apple II GS at home, I was often using a Unix system at work.  Eventually I wanted to keep purchasing newer software and little was being made for the Apple II.  So I decided to buy a new system.  My friends who were having trouble with thier Windows 3.1 machines, I decided to buy an Apple Mac.  It was a great machine.  That is about the same time bulletin boards were maxing out their usefulness and ISP's were taking that nitche market.  On-line communications were new and clunky.  That is when people started sending me attachments.  MS Word documents meant that I would spend a whole lot of time down-loading a friend's e-mail just to find out it was a Word document which would not be readable by my Claris Works word processor.  That is when I became an advocate of cross plateform portability.  Again I was stumbling onto technology that I liked but everyone else was doing something just a little different.  My adoption of Windows into my home came in the form of a gift to my daughters.  One of their relatives decided that he could give them his old machine.  That was only the first step.  The second step was a gift of a digital camera.  There was a Windows machine in my home and a camera that would not work with it.  In order to allow my daughter to use their camera, after a lot of frustration, I bought a Windows XP machine.  It really is a good machine and I don't have crashes or other plagues that bothered it's ancestors.  I no longer have any Apple machines running my home.  I think their still cool so don't worry.  But Window has finally won in a sense, but I just had to build a Linux machine so that I have not "given in to the dark side".    Things I have learned or values I have gained by my unorthodox journey.    1.  Technology really stands on training and social relationships.  The best tool is not always the one adopted.    2.  The early adapters of a technology learn a lot more than those who wait, but then they become vested agents of the technology.  Sort of like that unofficial Wendys guy.    3.  At a certain point, to maintain your technology outside the mainstream is painful.  Some say that when 15% of the work force adopts a technology, like say broadband, others almost forced to follow.  If they don't, the cost of not having the tool become painful to the non-adopter.  4.  Technology gave promises of enhancing education.  This is really still being worked out.  Technology used to attempt to be a nice tool for drill.  But drilling on a subject one has not knowledge of is pretty useless.  Simulations are expensive to create.  The real value of computers to education is that they are good for research and producing papers, graphics, presentations and other media.

      Of course my title in tongue in cheek, so don't take it literally.  The leadership in my church is called a Session.  As Presbyterians we have an elder form of church government.  As a group of elders, what is our job?  There are many models of leadership that people bring into the church.  Occationally the coach model is brought into the church. Ususally the leadership model comes from our employement.  Teachers I find tend to lead through schedule and procedure.  Those who work for the government tend to work off a policy manual.  There is nothing wrong with schedules, procedures and policy manuals inherently.  Some people who are used to writing policy, when reach a position of leadership in the church want to use that as a means of good leadership.  However, when I look at the Biblical model of eldership, I don't think a policy manual should be the main activity.  The main thing church leaders should know is God and scripture.  Good decisions, including those in a policy manual, should come from a deep prayer life and knowing God's Word.   urlLink Dr. Powell  says that a Session's job is to interpret the Bible not write law.  He says that the Session is a church court, not a legislative body.  While the term court has more legal connotations than I am comfortable with, I do agree, the job is to rightly apply the Word of God, not write policy.  In providing leadership, one must actually make decisions, and what is the difference between that and policy?  Well, policy is merely well thought out decisions.  So to be totally consistent, one really cannot rule out making a policy manual as a part of maintaining good order, but my real issue is the mindset that church leadership takes.  The main activity for church leadership is really applying the Word of God to the life of the congregation.

      What is a nation? What is a country? What is the state? What is the government? People define these different ways. My good friend the Jollyblogger has written another great article regarding the religious right, " urlLink Is This Land Our Land? ". In it he addresses several issues, one being can we have a Christian nation. Another is whether we had a Christian nation and some how it was stolen out from under us and now it has to be taken back.    Warrior Terminology   While I like a good, clean debate, I find myself more in agreement than disagreement with Jollyblogger's critic of those who want "to take back America". This type of rhetoric is used to inflame Christians who feel that they are in the minority. If Christians want to be salt and light in the culture, it is not because they are going to rule the culture but because Christians serve their fellow mankind.     History Of The Nation        I read several years ago  urlLink The Light and the Glory  -- by Peter Marshall, David Manuel. This book takes a fairly optimistic look at America's history and the thesis is that America had a Christian heritage. Those who have a secular worldview will find this book a trivial work which is the result of a bias on the part of the authors. The strength of the book is that the authors take at face value the evaluations of those who lived through our nation's history. They interpreted their own history. The founding fathers were not inerrant, nor even inspired in the sense of scriptural revelation. The weakness of the book is that it really is much too popular in its tone and composition to have an effect on anyone but the evangelical community in America. In a sense though, the great tide of interpretation of American history by secular historians has declared that America was evil and the powers that be are evil. The authors of The Light And The Glory are too optimistic about our nation's heritage, but their claims of God's providence in our history as Americans is not unfounded.    Francis A. Schaeffer    urlLink Francis A. Schaeffer  talked about in his lectures and books about Christian culture vice a Christian individual. Christian culture is that which has developed in a Biblical worldview. In his book " urlLink How Should We Then Live? " he says...  "Not all individual men who laid down the foundation for the United States Constitution were Christians; some, in fact, were deists. But we should realize that the word  Christian  can legitimately be used two ways. The primary meaning is: an individual who has come to God through the work of Christ. The second meaning must be kept distinct but also has validity. It is possible for an individual to live within the circle of that which a Christian consensus brings forth, even though he himself is not a Christian in the first sense. This may be true in many areas - for example, in the arts or political thought. Some of the men who laid the foundation of the United States Constitution were not Christians in the first sense, and yet they built upon the basis of the Reformation either directly through the  Lex Rex  tradition or indirectly through Locke. To whatever degree a society allows teh teaching of the Bible to bring forth its natural conclusions, it is able to have form and freedom in society and government."    What is a Christian family?     A Christian home has at least one parent who is a beleiver.  "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy."      I Corinthians 7:14   We pass the covenant from one generation to the next. It is a inherintly sloppy process to pass the covenant from one generation to another. Some children do not place their faith in Christ; some men and women turn from the faith they once embraced in their youth. Some have attempted to clean this situation up and it really makes each generation stand alone without intergenerational connections. The God of the Bible is the God of Abraham, Isacc and Jacob. The God of the grandfather, father and son. He has revealed himself as an intergenerational God. But not all of Abraham are truely children of faith. But a family which does not have an ideal state, Christian father, Christian mother, and Christian children, does not mean that the family is not Christian.    What is a Christian nation?   If we say the nation is the people, not the government as an institution, then a Christian nation is one which has Biblical thinking and values as the worldview of that society. Again, a lot of sloppy things happening when this does exist.  How would we get a Christian nation?  Not through politics that is for sure.  That is a sure path away from a Christian nation.  To get there, we need to preach the gospel.  That's it.  Yeah, I know, it is difficult to engage the culture and all that, but a winsome preaching of the gospel is the core activity of the church.

      My lovely bride gave 4 out of 5 stars to  urlLink Spiderman 2  . I gave 4 stars also. The special effects are great and so is the character development. Well, great character development for a super hero movie at least. One of the themes is that Spiderman can not seem to get it right because he does not have a great sense of his purpose and who he is. While there is something to understanding one's purpose, not everyone has to have a high sense of purpose. It has taken a while for me to figure this out, some people are driven by their calling and other people are faithful to thier calling. I for one am more of a driven by my calling. It has taken a while for me to understand those who are less driven.

       urlLink Joe Missionary has some interesting thoughts on the definition of a missionary.   In the end he says that both home and foreign missionaries are good.  He emphasizes that we should not put missionaries up on pedestal.  I like his post and agree, especially on the issue that we should not create layered system of a Christian, a saved-n-sanctified Christian, a wholly sanctified, ....., ta-dah; THE MISSIONARY!  This is true, however, the mandate to "make disciples of all nations" must not become usurped by an over summarization of what he said.  While there is no difference in the individual soul of someone overseas and someone on the home mission field, there a sense when God is especially glorified when His gospel is spread through out the world.  He is especially glorified when His name is spoken by every tribe, tongue and nation.  This is not a more important ministry, but it is obedience to the specific call and will of God as expressed in the scripture.  It is like the glory given to God when one generation praises His name to another.  It's that His glory transcends time, social barriers and geography.

      The following is a Sunday School lesson I wrote.  The College aged audience wanted to study depression.  Their topic, not mine.  Polling the group, the most troubling issues they faced was relationships.  So King Saul meets Judas the betrayer in this tongue in cheek play.    Scripture Lesson:   	Matthew 26:1-5, 14-16; 27:1-10 	1 Samuel 18:6-9; 19:1-10  Main Idea:  Some of the most poignant conflicts in life are from those who are supposed to be on our side; both those who we are supposed to be supported by or to whom we are giving our support.    A Reader's Theater About Depression   (Two patients at a mental hospital, Judas and Saul,  go out under the tree to smoke.  They strike up a casual conversation to pass the time as they puff on their cigarettes.)    Saul:  Hello. I am Saul.    Judas: How's it goin'?   I'm Judas.  ... (mutters to himself.)  Why do they have to put this smoke area all the way out here?  (Looking into his cigarette pack he sees that the thing is empty.  He ensures he is visibly disappointed.)  Man!  I'm out and they don't sell my brand here.    Saul:  I can perhaps help you.  Here you go.  (Flips a cigarette so Judas can pull one from the pack.  Judas takes one up.)  Judas: Thanks man.  I'll pay you back.  Saul:    Don't mention it.  Nice day out.  Judas:  Better since my boss left.    Saul:  Your boss visited you here, at this place?    Judas:  Yeah, he drives me crazy.    Saul:  How so?  Judas:  Well, he is always doing things, you know.  I mean if you’re in charge you gotta take the bull by the horns sometimes.  I was hoping we could complete this acquisition of another software company.  He let it pass without so much as even trying to put in a bid.    Saul:  So you are in here because you are disappointed that your boss did not take advantage of an opportunity to purchase one of your competitors?    Judas:  No, I'm in here cause I tried testing out the harakiri thing.  The cops frown on that, especially if you do it in a public area.  They want you to do it all private like.    Saul:  I see why they brought you here, but I'm a little lacking as to the reason that you are all up set with a failed business opportunity.  Judas:  It's kinda complex.  I have this 401K and a little nest egg.  The stock in this software firm, CosmicLogos, was bottoming out like.  I saw that it would be dirt-cheap.  So I took all my 401K, my nest egg and even some of the assets of my company and bought up almost 40% of their stock.  I knew it was a sweet deal.  I showed my boss that with just a little more cash, we could own the whole kit and caboodle.  My boss new I had risked every thing, but he was unsympathetic.  Something about not our business line.  Anyway, I lost seven years of savings when no one bought controlling interest in the firm.  Instead of being a great opportunity, I lost everything.    Saul:  Let me get this straight.  You used your company's money with out talking to the boss.    Judas:  Yeah, I was allowed to make purchases up to $100,000.00.  That was sweet.  I had 96 grand of my own.  But the thing was, the obvious choice was for him to kick in an extra 80 grand and we would have had controlling interest in that dinky outfit.  If only he would take a little risk.  This guy!    Saul:  Sounds like decent fellow if he is visiting you here.    Judas:  I wish he would just quit all this nice guy stuff.  You seem like you have a good head on your shoulders.  How did you get in here?  Saul:  Well,...I had an altercation with one of my employees.    Judas:  Come again...?  Saul:   I was having a bad day.  I was really concerned about the new composition of the board of directors.  David comes in.  He is an intern.  He starts telling me how nice my office looked, and kept going on about my Bose stereo.  This guy wants my office I tell you.    Judas:  What's this guy do for you?    Saul:  Like I said he is an intern from one of the MBA programs.  He does a little of everything.  He gets me coffee, but he also has typed several proposals for me.  To tell you the truth, he wrote a better proposal for the board of directors than I could ever have hoped.  He seems to have a lot of natural talent.  I could see how he wants my office in the executive suite.  The water cooler talk is all about his red hair and fantastic leadership abilities.    Judas:  So what does altercation mean exactly?    Saul:  I had a decorative sword on the mantle, a Samurai sword given to me by a Japanese customer.  He said he was trying to cheer me up.  I just could not listen any more to his lusting after my office.  I took the sword and thrust it his way.  Security came, I was taken into custody on assault charges, and the judge could see that I was an upstanding citizen so he and my lawyer came to an agreement.  Judas:  Who was trying to cheer you up?  The Japanese customer or this David dude?    Saul:  David.    Judas:  So you came after this kid because......  Saul:  Yes, it seems quite trivial now.  He is so young, not nearly a man of my stature but to be frank and honest, I'm fretfully jealous of him.    Judas:  It seems we both are having people problems; you with David and me with Mr. Nice guy.  And they say we have an illness.  I would say we have both been injured.  Where is the hospital for those nursing their pain?  Let’s blow this joint and go there?  (Both men laugh.)

      	 Recent History Of Religious Strife In America  	In the early half of the 1900s, the church in America had a number of denominations.  The ideas of liberal Christianity were in many if not most mainline denominations.   Labels to describe those inside and outside the movement developed.  The more liberal camp(s) were called modernist, liberal or later neo-orthodox.  Those in the more conservative camps are divided into the fundamentalists or evangelicals.  At the risk of oversimplification, this posting will NOT attempt to distinguish too much between all the variants but generalize into two segments; liberal and conservative.  By conservative I do not mean political conservatives, but those who would attempt to retain the basics of the faith.  In the early part of the 20th century the liberal type of Christianity did not attempt to establish new denominations or congregations, but mostly grew within the mainline denominations.  The ensuing debate between liberal Christianity with more conservative Christianity was over the basics of the faith and it was the conservatives who instigated the debate by and large.  Those who were a part of liberal Christianity were careful to not express their ideas directly to the wrong crowd so as to keep their employment and were content to patiently teach their doctrines from within the church.  It is not that they did not teach their doctrines, it is that they kept their cards close to their chest so as to be able to play the best hand.  Bold moves were made when the risk was low, more moderate positions were expressed when risk was higher.  The conservatives were the ones framing the debate and attempting to bring out the issues, often in strident tones that disenfranchised people with a disposition that embraced politeness and civility.  The debate was about the basics of the faith; the authority of scripture, the deity of Christ, the existence of hell, and the origins of the human race.  The result was that the conservatives by and large left the existing institutions to the liberal competitors and formed their own conservative denominations, conservative seminaries, conservative mission agencies and conservative congregations.  While these debates developed over a number of years, conservatives eventually felt forced to draw attention to the issues and act.  Few today are debating whether liberal Christianity is right or wrong, for the most part; liberals are kept in their corner and conservatives in theirs.  However, in conservative denominations there developed an examination at the beginning of a pastor's ministry to ensure the candidate for ministry adhered to the basics of the faith.  Apparently, prior to the liberal versus conservative debate the examination for the ministry focused on an internal sense of call.  Both liberal and conservative leaning candidates for ministry could express a sense of call.   	In a separate story line, small groups of Christians arose who had no denominational affiliation.  These groups were sometimes evangelical and at other times fundamentalists, but they wanted to follow God.  Strong leaders who had no accountability to an outside denomination usually led these groups.  The idea was to not get sucked into a denomination.  In the seventies, any small splinter groups that were controlling or had doctrinal error were labeled a cult.  Apologists who specialized in examining a splinter group's teaching and exposing their draconian practices arose to counter the many small sects.  By and large the method of countering their teaching was to focus on the basics of the faith like the deity of Christ and the Trinity.  (This also was used against larger sects like the Mormons or Jehovah's Witnesses who did not stick to the basics of the faith.)  In essence there was an unofficial list of those who were a part of some other broad umbrella label and those who were not. There are/were a number of broad umbrella labels used; the evangelical church, orthodox Christianity, or historic Christianity. 	 Recent Nullification Of The Means of Accountability  	The Emerging Church is an outgrowth of a wide variety of churches.  If the ministry is the result of splintering, it is often an issue of style or an issue regarding power.  But the most of the time, splinter would be an overstatement.  A quiet leaving for a different venue is the most common description of the event .  Many in the Emerging Church, like the web site Vintage Faith  (www.vintagefaith.com) affirm the traditional theology while expressing it through new media, thus the name “Vintage Faith”.  They seem to be an intentional church plant with the blessing of their sending church.  Again, we are taking into account the wide spectrum of ministries under the heading of Emerging Church.  The web site The Ooze (www.theooze.com), established by Spencer Burke, purports to “affirm traditional teachers and new artists”.  Spencer seems to be of the quiet leaving type.  Others are quite quick to affirm the Apostle's Creed.      In contrast with the previous debate over the basics of the faith in liberal versus conservative brands of Christianity, those in the Emerging Church want to affirm the basics so they can move on and address issues of life.  To discuss doctrine is to be too up tight; to share your own story is to be authentic.  The Emerging Church as a whole avoids the trap of not affirming the basics of the faith.  After a cursory affirmation, they move on to the more important issues of life.  To say that the movement has no doctrinal position is exactly what they would like to say, however, doctrine simply means teaching and they do have teachings.  Attempting to pin down a unified position of the movement is exactly what they want to avoid.  Their attempt seems to be to transcend doctrinal issues with authentic life.  While the liberals of the past avoided stating their true beliefs if the environment was not welcoming, the Emerging Church seems to quickly agree with their would be opponents on issues of the authority of the Bible, the deity of Christ, etc.. and move quickly to new,  more important issues like a persons struggles with doubt.  The mechanisms conservatives developed to counter the liberal infiltration are ineffective in holding individuals from the Emerging Church accountable. By and large it is not an infiltration of existing structures.  In fact, the technique of building a separate institutional infrastructure used by the conservative Christian community is also the means for the rise of the Emerging Church.  The new congregations, or should I say communities, which are being developed are affirming the basics of the faith, thus avoiding being put on the unofficial list.  They are also avoiding accountability and debate.  Note: I'm NOT calling the Emerging Church a cult, however it is clear that the plain examination which holds a group accountable to the larger body of Christ is missing.  In order to address the issues pertaining to the Emerging Church, one must examine issues that they raise.  Just because someone affirms The Apostle's Creed does not mean that his or her other teachings are okay.  Throughout the ages of the church, creeds were developed to respond to movements, individuals and teachings.  So creeds addressed different issues in different periods of history.  While it is good we can agree that Jesus was born of the Virgin Mary, it is also important to discern what is meant by that statement.  On an Evangelism Explosion visit my wife met a couple that had visited our church.  The wife was a believer who had just given birth to twins.  The husband was an officer in the Coast Guard.  The husband expressed and interest in becoming a Christian.  When the team started to clarify the commitment, the wife started to clarify for the team what her husband meant.  He believed religion was merely a social institution that aided society in passing down morals.  He did not want to actually accept Christ; he wanted to become a Christian so that his wife did not have an “unbelieving spouse”.   In other words, he wanted to be nice to his wife and become a Christian for her sake, though he thought the whole issue of accepting Christ was a non-issue.  If assent to a belief becomes something other than what everyone understands it to be, clarification must be made.  Assent to The Apostle's Creed, or any other Creed, if it is the test of accountability to a larger Christian community, must not be usurped by a different understanding of the nature of truth. The issues of style and form that are by and large the identity markers of the movement, those are matters of preference.  Often style is merely a matter of artistic form, but where it is transformed to become an actual part of the theology, it must be examined on its merits as theology.

      Years ago I read the book  urlLink Lessons of History  by Will and Ariel Durant.  They talked about in one chapter that liberals are those who have new ideas and conservatives are those who stand for the old ideas and test the new ones.  In a sense, both are necessary.  So an innovator is a liberal, for instance Newt Gingrich is an innovator, though he be right wing in his political persuasion.  Also, James Dobson and Jerry Falwell are actually innovators, not conservatives.  In the 1980's when the conservative Christian community started getting involved in politics, they were innovators. (Politically conservative that is.)  Especially in the fundamentalists circles, Jerry Falwell was a real liberal.  He was actually trying to be a part of the process in America.  With his Fundamentalist style, he thought he would become a part of the solution.  America said no by and large.  His innovation was by and large a failure.    Another segment of the conservative Christian political movement in the 80's, the pro-life movement, decided that it should adopt the same techniques as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., civil disobedience.  This adaptation of Ghandi and Dr. Kings techniques also failed by and large.  The civil disobedience of Martin Luther King Jr. was not blessed because he was such a skilled leader, because he used the right techniques.  He may have been a great leader, but the righteousness of his cause was really what made his role in history so important in the civil rights movement.  God did NOT bless his efforts because he protested the right way, but because the African-American community was (is) oppressed.  Civil leaders in our US government were not totally impressed with his techniques, but his cause.  They knew several power issues were at stake.  They could have attempted to continue to surprise the cause.  Instead they choose to quit opposing the civil rights movement.  When the Christian-Fundamentalist community looked for roles after which to model their own community involvement, they could not look to anyone who was a part of the system.  The pro-lifers were by and large Fundametalists and Pentecostals were outsiders to the political process.  Martin Luther King could be pointed to as a successful outsider.  So they adopted his model as their model for enacting social change.  But the civil leaders in the 80's were not duped by the use of civil disobedience.  Pointing to Dr. King and being willing to suffer just did not cut it.  The debate about abortion was still on going.  (I'm fully pro-life, however, I see the issue is indeed complex.)  The pro-life movement lost their innovation of using political activism.  Losing the period of Christian activism in the 80's also showed the sovereignty of God.  His hand of providence did not falling short.    What can we say we learned by the failure of Christian activism in the 80's?    1.  We need the grace of God, not activisim techniques which show the strength of man. 2.  God limits our power. 3.  God does not work on our schedule. 4.  Most political leaders expect people to make the system work. 5.  Most people expect people to make the system work. 6.  Strident tones in discussion gives people indigestion. 7.  The opponents of righteousness will attempt to dress up their cause as righteous too.      Comments welcome.

      Have you ever read one magazine for about 15-16 months to find that it is repeating itself?  I love to read magazines.  Okay, sometimes I'm ashamed, I go off and buy a secret issue of, you guessed it;  urlLink Linux Journal .  Some of the articles are a little over my head, but cool, I'm in there with the real geeks.....or am I?  While there are many exceptions to what I'm about to say, I think people often buy magazines for the sake of bolstering their image to themselves.  Sort of like driving a SUV to say that your a big outdoor type of guy, even though you have not been camping, fishing, boating or off the Interstate High way in a significant way in a couple of years.  The expense and being seen in the rugged vehicle tells not only the world who the guy behind the wheele is, but also is pretty convincing to one's self.  In regard to magazines, I see people reading magazines that does not quite fit what they do.  Guys who don't work out reading exercise magazines, gals who don't take care of themselves reading  urlLink Glamour , guys who drive heaps of junk reading  urlLink Road and Track  seems to be more than a common occurance.  Since the content is repeated every few months, and the photographs are variations on the same thing every month, and the main thing that really changes is the date of publication what is really sold to the consumer.  I think it is image.  Image that the kind of person who reads this magazine is the kind of person I'm hoping to become.  So instead of reading a new issue of Linux Journal perhaps I should finish that database project using PHP and MySQL.  Instead of checking out the latest issue of  urlLink Backpacker  magazine, perhaps I should plan a hike with my five daughters.  Instead of borrowing an old issue of  urlLink Christianity Today  from a co-worker, I should actually do something to help someone who is struggling financially so that I am living out my faith in both the public and private sector.  Maybe the real answer here is that someone needs to put out a magazine about people who  transcend image and actually are the type of people they would like to be.

           In my own family, my grandma Beulah is the kindest, most gentle, nicests, and godly matriarch.  She is the example of a Christian to me.  In fact, women were the real leaders in my church growing up.        A few years ago the church Session on which I sit had to make a decision.  Do we allow women to teach Sunday School?  Our former pastor took the position that the teaching excluded by 1 Tim 2:11-15 was that of the pulpit ministry.  Anything else like Sunday School teacher or small group leaders was okay in his opinion.  He felt that those positions did not have the same authority as the pulpit.  A situation came about that a woman started leading a video series as a Sunday School lesson.  That is when we got a letter from one of the godly elderly women of our congregation.  She explained kindly and gently that we should not be allowing this.  The Session started discussing what we believed was the Biblical position.  I read on my own the following books:   urlLink Women in Ministry: Four Views  by Bonnidell Clouse, Robert G. Clouse       Clouse and Clouse did not really give a convincing conclusion.  I really wanted to be convinced that women should be in ministry.  Even though Clouse and Clouse sound scholarly, I was never quite settled. It really did not answer the Sunday School teacher question.      urlLink The Role Relationship of Men and Women: New Testament Teaching  by George W. Knight       Knight was good too, but there was no answer to the Sunday School question.   urlLink Women In The Church:  A Fresh Analysis of 1 Timothy 2:9-15  by Andreas J. Kostenberger, Thomas R. Schreiner and H. Scott      Kostenberger and crew took the high road in exegesis; linguistics, archeology, context of the passage, etc... In the end, no answer to the Sunday School question.  The real issue addressed was women in pulpit ministry.  This was the most convincing work about the women in the pulpit issue.  I highly recommend it.     urlLink Biblical Eldership  by Alexander Strauch      This book does not address women in ministry directly but is an excellent book.  The issues addressed help me come to my final position.    After a long study we came to the conclusion that those who teach Sunday School to men should be men.    A few weeks ago I informed my class of college and career Sunday School students that the women of the class could not lead.  My 19 year old daughter was the only one present.  One of the young men of the class came to her defense.  She told him that she actually agreed with the Session's position.   A new blog recommended by  urlLink Rebecca Writes  addresses women teachers.  I also highly recommend Sober Minded's article on  urlLink Madame Teacher .  I think for this issue to be settled, women of the church will have to take a stand.  I have a stand, but of course being a guy is a problem.  When I read the scripture, people think I'm prejudiced.  Neither Rebecca nor Sober Minded have my blight.  So write on Sober Minded.

          Again, my good friend and pal the Jollyblogger is discussing Christian strategy for influence in the Western culture in his posting  urlLink What We've Lost .  I agree with almost everything in his posting.  Two exceptions I would take.   1.) I'm not sure the European common man can not be won.  Having lived in Europe, it is a strange mixed bag.  Europe is not necessarily its academic institutions.  Europeans as a whole have a better liberal arts tradition.  Their is an amazing amount of good, Bible beleiving Christians there. The institutions are as you say, lacking in a Christian worldveiw.  (Oh by the way,  urlLink Sweden has an offical state church .  We may disdain it, pun intended, but there is a tie between church and state.)  But back on topic, it will take a supernatural work of God, but Europe is not  a lost cause.  With God all things are possible.  Having said all that, Os is right about the state of the Western civilization as a whole; the common man in America is the last bastion of Christian influence in the West.    2.) Protesting is not necessarily bad.  I guess by protesting one means someone is being obnoxious, that's a sin.  I think I have committed that sin a couple of times.  If it merely means speaking against something publically, is blogging a form of protesting when it includes that element?  Of course, formal debate is something that can be cordial or obnoxious too.  Just because someone is polite does not mean that they are neccessarily nice.  (Of course, again, I think of myself again.)  Making all Christians stop protesting, or protesting against protestors will really not make them nice people either.  There is a character issue at stake.         In our tribalistic society, it is easy to turn on our fellow Christian.  It is easy to distance ourselves from our brothers in Christ, because  we are not a part of them .  We are the  other  kind.  It is easy to put them in a category of Christian that does not merit a hearing.  Of course, they may be impolite but right.  The same principles should apply to obnoxious Christians as apply to the nice ones.  Assume, for the most part, they have a point.  Assume at the begining that they are not contradicting themselves.  Understand their message from their point of view.  Attack the issue not the person.  In other words, teach them how to debate in a cordial manner by example.

      By the way, I just called Focus On The Family.  I let them know that publishing Mr. Moore's home address might actually cause people to harrass him or do more.  They simply said that was not their intent.  They gave a well formed answer but did not back down from their position, which is what I expected.

      My good friend and pal the Jollyblogger has written an  urlLink insightful piece  on the recent Focus On The Family newsletter which encouraged a grassroots effort against the recent Michael Moore movie, Fahrenheit 9/11.    Some food for thought:   1.  Political activism seemed to be a panacea for Christians in the 1980's to solve the irrelevance that the church felt.  In a sense, we did not know how to be a part of public dialogs.  (By the way blogging is a part of public dialog.)  We were sloppy at it.  When we lost we did not know how to be a gentleman or a lady and loose graciously.  Without the ability to loose graciously we are left with tyranny, even if its done by the "good guys".  However, I'm not against political activism, but its not the job of the church.  The job of the church in context of the nation is lead it in the spiritual formation of the people, individual and corporate.  In other terminology, disciple the nation.  But as citizens of our nation, Christians should be activists, but ones who show love and are competent in discussing issues without slinging mud.    2.  Focus On The Family is not a congregation, a denomination, or a mission agency.  I'm not sure I see how their only sphere of influence is to go on the defensive if Christians are being persecuted.  I'm not sure that is the role of church leaders in general.  I'm frankly confused by that line of thinking, I think the idea is that if it was the case that Michael Moore was attacking Christians for the cause of Christ, then we would love him as someone made in the image of God.  Since he is merely attacking a politician, we should ...     3.  I have to say that I disagree with Focus On The Family's publishing of a personal mailing address is irresponsible.  If they wanted to get this information to Michael Moore they can do so without putting him at risk.    4.  Michael Moore is not playing fair.  That does not mean we need to stoop to his level.  Where is the technically competent, artistically excellent film which gives a balanced account of the war on terrorism and the Bush administrations handling of it.  I know they are not perfect.    5.  I understand that the left would like to take the tax exempt status of select conservative non-profit institutions.  From my understanding of history and strategy this is not an attempt at making a level playing field but a power play.    6.  We have to be careful as Christians that we don't fall into the strategy.  For instance they want to say religion is the sphere of the personal.  Politics is the sphere of the public and never shall the twain meet.  Religion and politics are both public and personal.  My behavior in my own home is not outside the sphere of the law.  Nor is public policy outside the transcending law of God.  (Note to all who see these, I'm not in favor of a theocracy.)  So in summary, the role of the Christian in public debate and politics is complex.  Simple solutions will usually cause us to get cornered by our adversaries.  A thinking Christian who is also virtuous is what is in demand.  Let our hearts be affectionate for truth, justice and liberty.  Not a mere motto, but real ideas that can make the nation great.

      Thanks to  urlLink Rebecca Writes  who clued me into the  urlLink Christian Carnival  hosted by Messy Christian.  I had read about the Christian Carnival but not really understood what it was all about.  Oh by the way, Messy Christian claims to be disorganized, I think she is just comfortable with loose ends.  She also has a great blog.

      Looking at the Emerging Church, often what I see is that the Emerging Church is both an expression of identity and resistance to an over simplified identity.  What is a person? At our essence, are we merely genetic material?  Are we the product of our own choices?  Can we really choose to be anything we want to be?  Can I choose to be an eighteenth century traveling Dutch minstrels who sings German songs in the Italian countryside?  (No, primarily because I have a hard time carrying a tune without some accompaniment.  The German language thing I could work on.  And time travel does not seem to be working out either.) In reality my context does dictate some of my identity and I have choices on how to play the proverbial cards I have been dealt.  It seems to me that the Emerging Church have become quite competent at being creative at not being normal.  In other words, normally they attempt to not be normal.  Demographic segment has become a major issue that those associated with the Emerging Church at the same time emphasis and despise.  So there is an emphasis on pointing out the collage that makes up one's life.  I think most people could as a matter of form describe themselves in terms of disjointed things thrown together.  One writer for the Emerging Church describe herself as "a female Lutheran teaching theology at a Catholic college".  And that would be accurate.  I could also describe myself in colliding terms.  I'm grew up in a rural community which valued working with your hands but I love the study of foreign languages and philosophy.  I spend most of my time in meetings and behind a computer.  I grew up in a family which ultimately valued the practical, but I love the abstract.  In one sense, the emphasis on demographics is actually tipping the hat to modern thought on marketing studies, where marketing specialists define a market segment.  What could be more suburban and modern than to classify one's self in these terms.  By reacting to a demographic category, the reaction actually agrees with the modern definition that we are our demographic sector.  They agree with the assumptions of the category and attempt to somehow transcend it in small victories of apparent category contradiction.  But even with the conundrums, the person is really being influenced by the definition of the category.  (Note, we must also recognize that many people want to transcend their demographic group but face the prejudice of others that truly holds them back.  This is quite different than emphasizing a certain style of worship, or music in worship.)   Sure Jesus was a Galilean, but did he really want to advertise himself as a single, 30 something male of Hebraic Jewish origins with a working class education.  Enjoys quite strolls along the beach at sunrise, etc... However, as people made in the image of God, the demographic category need not be the controlling feature of our existence.  I'm suggesting that our demographic category should have less, not more emphasis, in the church.  The church should be from every nation, tribe and tongue.  The church crosses generational lines so that one generation shall praise his works to another.

      Just got back from vacation.  On vacation I visited Tangier Island, VA.  To get there we took the ferry from Crisfield, MD.  On the way back from the Island one couple noted how neat and clean the homes and yards were.  The couple had visited Smith Island and said there were a lot of junk cars and things.  I suppose disposal of items would be problematic with no land fill.  But the couple attributed the cleanness of Tangier to the religious nature of the community.  The idea that a people's Christian morals could make a difference visibly in a community intrigued me.

      I one time asked someone if they had a book on  urban ministry .  I was taking a  urlLink course on urban ministry  and was required to read a certain number of pages.  It was funny that the person thought I was using the phrase as a euphemism for Afro-American ministry.  Perhaps he was thinking of  urlLink Tony Evans ' radio show, the Urban Alternative, which by the way I recommend.  But what I really meant was a book about ministry in the city.  The city is where most people live today, but we are resistant to embrace the city.  New Yorkers are probably the only people I see saying they love their city.  Movies like "You've Got Mail" can idealize New York, but Dallas is idealized by living several miles away on a big ranch. By the way, a lot of people have contrasted the suburban and urban experience.  I've come to the conclusion that there is no need to do so.  America has a romance with the outdoors, but really lives in the city.  Our lives are disconnected from our idealized life we wish we had.  The suburbs are an attempt at a meaningful middle ground, city and rural.  If a pastor today is going to embrace the city, they do so to embrace the people.  Isn't that what cities are all about, people?    The lectures by Glenn Smith were formative in my own ideas about urban ministry.  He works in a ministry,  urlLink Christian Direction Inc. , Montreal, Quebec.  The "big take away" from the course was that we need to understand our context by studying it.  Then pray and adjust our strategy for ministry on the community needs.  I have come to discern a slight error in how the call from ministry as I understood it growing up.  Growing up we talked a great deal about a sense of call from God.  There is another part to the call that is important, a sense of need to do God's work, regardless of talent, and the need in the community.  I'm not discounting that subjective experience totally, but subordinating it to the need for people to hear from God.    The city is a place where there is a mixture of many messages and needs.  To adequately address the needs in the church needs a clear understanding of the message and plan how to get that message out.  We need to counter the false messages that are going out which actually put people in bondage.  Referring to yesterdays posting here, we need a full spectrum communication: mercy ministry, apologetics, personal proclamation, media and the arts.  This strategy must never try to replace preaching, but all should re-enforce the preaching of the Word.

      1 Samuel 9:2 He had a son named Saul, an impressive young man without equal among the Israelites-a head taller than any of the others.   A preacher many years ago used the phrase "head and shoulders" as a description of the government Israel had under Saul because Saul was "head and shoulders" taller than everyone else and because he depended on his own smarts and strength.  To a certain degree the preacher mentioned "head and shoulders" as a way of refering to the shampoo in order to make it easy to remember.  I have no problem at all using the phrase as an attention getting devise, but on the other hand, I don't see the connections between the description of Saul and the type of dependance on human strength that was exibited by Saul.  I'm not sure that this is good exegesis, but it seems to fit anyway.  While it is very conveinent for the preacher to point out the correlation between Saul's description and the his spiritual state, is that what the original human author meant and is that what the original recepiants of the text would have thought of by the text.  I'm quite tempted to use the teaching myself because Saul's life does show one while blessed of God in some ways, but also shows a dependancy on self instead of a dependancy on God.    I often find people who look to human forms of power as ultimate power.  Power is fleeting.  I remember a story by a Army officier who retired.  He went to the military hospital and gave his ID card to the new solder behind the counter.  The soldier said, "How can I help you buddy?"  Of course those who know the military, this is very inappropriate way to address an officier, but the young soldiers saw the man as a retiree, not an officier.  One day, "Sir, yes sir".  The next day, "How can I help you buddy?"    God's power is not fleeting.  His strength is not for a moment.  His wisdom will not disapate due to alzheimer.  His wealth will never be depleted.  I want Christ as my head and lean on His shoulders.

        You speak eloquently and have seemingly read every book ever published. You are a fountain of endless (sometimes useless) knowledge, and never fail to impress at a party. What people love: You can answer almost any question people ask, and have thus been nicknamed Jeeves. What people hate: You constantly correct their grammar and insult their paperbacks.    urlLink   What Kind of Elitist Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Hat Tip to  urlLink Uncle Sam's Cabin

      Verse 1 – 2:   Who is the author here?  While it really does not identify him specifically, the person that the early church would have thought the context is Jude, the brother of Jesus.  Why does he not say that?  The same as James, the brother of Jesus who does not call on his kinship, but says he is a servant of Jesus Christ.  That is the most important aspect of his relationship.  Matthew 12:48  The letter is not specific about how the destination is.  The tone of calling the Dear Friends suggest that this is not a general letter to everyone.  The men who have slipped is a specific event.  Though one could argue that it was happening in multiple congregations, the simplest way to interpret the text is that this is written to a specific congregation or set of congregations which had a relationship with Jude.  Called – How we came to be Christ's  Loved – Our current state with him Kept – What will maintain our relationship with God  Mercy – Being given a break Peace – Not at war, internally or externally Love – Strong affection or desire for someone  Verse 3 – 4:  The faith that Jude is wanting them to content for is not an official confession but the teaching that they received.  This teaching came in the form of the preaching of the gospel.  Preaching is the authoritative declaration of the Word of God.  What is the distinction?  The main point of the letter is that there will be false teachers, but it really does not address specific doctrinal error.  The core issue is the false teacher phenomena.  That this phenomena is expected.  The false teachers can be identified by two things;  teachings which change the essence of the faith and a life that is not godly.  While the book is teaching the audience and therefore us to contend for the faith, it is not teaching us to be contentious.  We as well as the early church must distinguish between different forms which do and those that do not maintain the essence of the faith.    Verse 5:  Jude starting in verse five begins a long list of references to scripture, other Jewish literature of the time and analogies from nature.  The two non-biblical Jewish writings are The Assumption Of Moses (9) and the Apocalypse of Enoch (14).  These are somewhat problematic.  Is the writer saying these are on par with scripture, were they left out of the cannon?  Well, I would point out that Paul quotes in Titus 1:12 Crete's own poets.  In this passage, Paul is quoting for a point of reference for the people.  So we need to be careful about reading into the passage more support for these writers than necessary.  I might quote Augustine or Chuck Swindoll but that does not mean that I hold them as inspired in the same sense as scripture.  Also, the analogies from scripture are not thought to be revelatory but merely points from which discuss the

       1 Samuel 1:1-2    	  Elkanah Is A Devote Levite From The Days Of The Judge        Cross reference (cf.) With Judges 13:2; 17:1; 19:1, 1 Chronicles 6:33-34. Ramah means hilltop as in hilltop fortress town.  Elkanah was not Ephraimite by tribe but by geography; the same way Bethlehem was in the tribe of Judeah's region but in Ephrath (cf. Genesis 35:16,19; Ruth 4:11; Micah 5:2).    1 Samuel 1: 3-8    	  Elkanah Is A Devout Levite With A Disfunctional Family 				       cf. Genesis 4:19, 16:1-16; Genesis 21:8-21; Genesis 29:14b-24. The phrase “better than 10 sons” may have been an idiom used to comfort.  (cf. Ruth 4:15)    1 Samuel 1: 9-18    	  Hannah Pours Out Her Soul ; Eli Observes Her Heartfelt Prayer  				  1 Samuel 1:19-20    	  The LORD Listens To Hannah's Prayer 				       Samu – El = Listen – God  =  God Has Heard    1 Samuel 1:21-28    	  Hannah Gives Her Son To The LORD

      In my small group we are studying "post cards of the Bible".  I took the title from a series of Chuck Swindoll a few years ago.  That is the only connection between his series and my own.  We are studying all books in the Bible under three chapters long.  I may make it under five chapters if we are still enjoying it.  The book of Jude is mostly about warning about false prophets.  It does not seem to address a particular false teaching or practice.  I know a lot of groups are very inward focused and narrow.  I started to encourage the group not to be that way, and I realized I was starting to talk them out of the meaning of the text of Jude.  So by talking about the difference between being too narrow and letting a false teach harm us we did keep our balance.  There is a lot of teaching in the New Testament about false teachers.  For us, I think it is problematic to teach these passages without pointing fingers at a particular group.  In reality, false teachers talking about in the scripture are from within.     2 Peter 2:1 But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you.

      I read a  urlLink blog  which asked questions about role playing games.  The young man who wrote the blog was offended at the harsh tones used by some to denounce Dungeons and Dragons.  I have not had much experience with Dungeons and Dragons.  The last time I really had any discussions with anyone was my Senior year in high school so I'm not sure it really is the same game that it was then.  Since I am under qualified to discuss Dungeons and Dragons, I leave that alone for now.    When people are trying to decide right from wrong, many people attempt to make a list of things to "do" and things "not to do".  This is usually in the form of don't drink, don't smoke, don't watch R rated movies, don't dance, don't etc.... Often these lists of "do's" and "don'ts" address issues which are not directly addressed in the Bible.  People do want to know the bottom line, can I play Dungeons and Dragons or not.  In reality, the list becomes an additional law besides the moral law, the 10 Commandments.  We need to be careful about adding to the list. On the other hand there are a lot of things that have moral implications which are not addressed in the 10 Commandments.  While I believe in one sense they are addressed, in another sense things like illegal drugs, pornography, movies, gothe clothing and a whole list of other topics are not addressed in their modern form.  The underlying issues are not new but the forms are.     Role On Brother   The core to a role playing game is that it is a game that involves the imagination.  Some people enjoy that but others don't.  Role playing takes a lot of forms besides those in a game.  For instance, there are plays, skits, opera on the artistic side of the house.  But on the more practical side, astronauts, pilots and soldiers go through simulations and exercises which are in their essence people playing roles.  Firemen, ambulance drives and policemen also go through similar training.  We even do this when we have a fire drill.  Sometimes we play roles to have fun; sometimes to practice for life situations.  Playing roles is a human activity that few people could really say is sin.    One thing about role playing, a person can act in a way that he does not normally get to do.  This is the point of a fire drill.  However, in the world of fantasy, many people like to change their persona through costume or role playing in order to do things they would not normally be allowed to do.  While not everyone who goes to a night club is in this category, some people who would normally dress and act quite conservatively, once they dress the part, they act outrageous once properly in the role.  In other words, playing the role helps them loose some inhibitions.  If loss of inhibitions helps someone overcome a fear, that is an healthy thing.  My creative drama teacher told the story of how as a teacher she helped an extremely shy little girl.  The girl would not say a word to anyone.  The teacher used an orange sheet as a prop for her class.  The teacher gave the sheet to each child and asked what they imagined they were.  One girl wadded it up and held it like a baby, she was a mommy.  A boy draped it over his shoulder, he was a Roman soldier.  When the extremely shy girl's turn came the teacher threw the sheet in the air.  The teacher let it fall on the girl and she said, “I’m a pumpkin".  The world of make believe helped her to participate in the group.  But loosing inhibitions is not always healthy, especially if the inhibition keeps one from sinning.  It is not unusual to used role playing as a way to engage in illicit sexual behaviors.  Violent angry feelings are played out in certain games.  Another area that people would not normally avoid but when playing a role allow themselves to dabble in is the occult.     Deuteronomy 18:9-13    Detestable Practices   9 When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. 10 Let no one be found among you who sacrifices his son or daughter in [1] the fire, who practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, 11 or casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. 12 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD , and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. 13 You must be blameless before the LORD your God.    My own exposure to Dungeon's and Dragons is when my good friend in high school got involved.  He was smart and a good Christian.  His playing the roles made him comfortable with going to a fortune teller after his SAT.  (He wanted the fortune teller to tell him what he made.)  While I'm not saying that everyone who plays D and D will do such a thing, dabbling in the occult is more acceptable once the it is done repeatedly in a game.  And I want to again say that I do not know how much the occult is a part of D and D anymore.  It might be a very different game than it was in the late 70's/early 80's.     Conclusion   It would hardly be possible to remove all role playing from our lives, nor would it be desirable.  When we do play roles, it is okay to do so to have fun and for training purposes.  However, we should not allow ourselves to let role playing be an excuse to sin.

       urlLink Joe Missionary  has a blog swap with  urlLink Spy Journal .  I'm not sure how to reference the recursive nature of his blog swap, whose is it any way.  I like this posting on Joe Missionary by Spy Journal, and I wanted to expand on a particular topic. I agree there is some worthy management techniques, but we should be careful how we go about employeeing these techniques and embracing these techniques. That issue in particular that IMHO needs expanding is the development of church vision statements.  In the 80's and 90's there was a lot of seminars, books, training sessions on building vision in the business environment.  Often times this was merely a lot of hype about having a directed discussion which made people a part of the process.  While discussion and dialog are good ways of envigorating thinking, of course not everything everyone says can be the direction of the organization.  Not everyone has sound ideas and not everyone should direct the group.     How does someone develop mission and vision?           Mission   Starting with a mission statement, a church does not develop its mission, it is something received from Christ the head of the church through His inspired Word. I used to attend a church that brought in an outside consultant to help develop its mission statement.  After a lot of questionaires, small group meetings and discussion, the church leadership developed a mission statement which said,"...blank church...mission is to glorify God by building Biblical disciples".  Not a bad statement, but I really beleive that making Biblical disciples is a core mission for all churches.  There was not nothing distinctive about this statement in comparison to other Bible beleiving churches.         Vision   In regard to vision statements, not every congregation needs a transcending vision that stretches every one.  Some churches are stable in their life cycle.  The members are regulars.  The hopes for growth are limited by populations of the community.  Such churches are good and glorify God.  But planting a new church which seeks to reach the unreached for Christ does need vision; vision and strategy.  When Paul was seeking to reach the Romans "he long to come unto them" and "often planned to come unto" them, but was prevented.  God gave him vision to "preach where Christ had not been preached before".  Rather than being built on a vision building techniques used by the business world, I believe that the man of God who is called to establish a new work needs a burden from the Lord to do the work.  The effort must be bathed in prayer.  These pioneers who do things like plant churches or establish Bible translation missionary organizations are those who I call driven by their calling.  Those who maintain an established work, day in and day out are what I call faithful to their calling.  The visionary is driven by the burden to preach God's word where it has not been preached before.  The pastor who is faithful to his calling cares for the people in fair and bad weather alike.  God has given different gifts to the body and both of these are essential.  Those who have a burden for a new work do not necessarily have a clear written statement, but they do have something clear in their mind that they can communicate to others.  Vision statements are helpful if leaders use them to communicate to the group where they are going.  If stability is all that is called for, then a vision statement is merely management fluff. Those who do not need a vision statement should ignore the fad.  Those have a vision for a new work of God may benifit by clarifying that vision in the form of a statement and build understanding of that vision through directed discussions and gaining insights from the wisdom of the group.
