      There are many arguments that can be put forth about the commercial advertising of tobacco products in Kenya. I for one feel that the Kenyan public should not be exposed to such kind of advertising. We have seen kids as young as 15 years old smoking in public because the commercials can explain much better on how smoking is fancy than a parent can advise his or her kid on the effects of smoking. It is with such maneuver that we have witnessed and experienced family breakups.   Of course I am not against people smoking, but I am very sure that this very group will agree with me that smoking in Kenya among the youths under the age of 18 is on the increase than any other age group, and it is doing so at a very alarming rate. It is essential that if the tobacco companies stop advertising their products on Television and Radio, there will be a less percentage of the problem that I am bringing up here.  Give your take.

      I Like Blair. I listen to his speeches in the House of Commons a lot more that I listen to Bush at his ranch in Crawford. I do believe that he is a born leader out to make positive progress. As I was reading the BBC news online about him accepting that there may be no WMDs in Iraq, I see the leadership feature in him. But as I continue reading on how he was taking question in the House of Commons and it comes out that he supported the war in effort to get involved in the Middle East peace process, I see fault.   It is like a business. Barter trade if you like, exchange of good for good, or exchange of services for services. It sounds like a fair deal but one of the receving end is far much better than the other one.

      A woman in a store crying foul that it could be wise for the US to pull out its troops. She believes that now that Iraq has a new Government in place, at least majority of the men and women in uniforms should be brought back. The old lady was happy that her son who served during the 1st Gulf war came back home alive and uninjured. The Bush administration going to war was unjustified in the first place, she says, and we are fighting for oil and occupancy. After watching the Fahrenheit 911, she believed the implication in the movie that the Bush family is linked to Osama bin Laden is true.  Arguable, isn’t it? You can either agree that the Iraq war was justified or not. Was it? I don’t think the evidence that was tabled to the United Nations when the US was seeking a UN resolution to invade Iraq, it was arguably convincing. When Collin Powell showed the whole world on the capabilities of Iraq to produce WMDs, no one ever knew that it was all like a movie being directed, only for the men and women in uniform to be used as its staring actors.   Given that now that the US is in Iraq, all work has to be accomplished. But eyebrows are being raised on how long it will take for them to get out. There are more and more cases of soldiers dying, and yes, some are being beheaded. But it has to be taken into consideration that the number of deaths that are being reported should not be related to the success that the US has done. In any case, the Iraqi people are free, and the former President is facing the justice that he denied to many.

      One question. Why did the cow cross the road? I am sure you know the answer to that. And now to what I am trying to get into, why did Kibaki win the Presidential elections? Rhetorical question it is but if I guess right here, all Kenyans, young and old, poor and rich, tall and short, fat and skinny, males and females voted in the December elections to oust the Kanu regime which had been given a mandate for 24 good years but left all stones in every aspect unturned.  As much as that is a fact, the Kenyans who choose for vote in the mysterious 2002 elections did so with the hope that Kibaki would turn things around. Two years later agony is still the same ol same ol. The New Constitution that was promised and prioritized has been relegated to non-priority. Is it because Kibaki and his cronies fear and relentlessly think again and again on who the post of the prime minister will end up to? I am sure that if the current president was promised the seat of the Prime Minister there could not have been any whining. It is only that when the name of Raila Odinga pops up as the preffered and widely respected figure on that position does the Murungis, Murungarus, and what have you do they reserve to verbal cholera. Not forgetting to mention the infamous first lady that Kenyan has ever had.  I do remember with a lot of passion and anger when Kenyans were reduced to mere animals when the Moi regime used the unprecedented method that the whole world witnessed on the 3rd of July this year. It's been like ever since the NARC government assumed power, tit for tat has been the mechanism that is in place of tranquility. We have so far witnessed abhorrence in place of adoration. There has been compromise in the corridors of power. Vices which every Kenyan considered history.  What difference does it make when all Kenya did was change of leader's names. How promised are we of a better Kenya and just to use the Former US president a Land shining on a hill.

      A friend of mine, bearing the fact that I am a friend of me, was trying to hook up with another lady in Kenya. She was damn fine and the friend of mine feels inferior towards sawa chics, and so when she sent him her picture, the jamaa kinda laid back for a moment. That was two years ago, and still the jamaa is laying back. But then again, that is not the only thing that the jamaa needs some advise on.   See the lady was attending a college in Kenya and she had a field study. Her field work was on the street children in Nairobi and she really needed help financially. Since the jamaa was in the US, he promised the lady that he was gonna help her on that. But as time moved by, with the jamaa taking his time laying back, he completely forgot his promise to the lady. Been two years and he still thinks about it. Please post some solid replies.

      A few days ago in the Newspapers we were reading on how the abortion mystic was unveiled. But right now it seems like Kenyan needs more journalists. The vice seems like a century ago and it needs some revistation.

      There are very uncommon mistakes that Kenyans are witnessing today. Some of the mistakes were either a forgotten case given that President Moi is no longer the ruler, while some of them are because of some of the leaders commannding power for the first time.   For instance, have you ever thought that Chris Murungaru is either sick or weird? He is always running his mouth talking about something he knows he should be serious about. Example, remember when he was commenting that all ladies should not wear trousers? There are many statements of his recollections that can prove otherwise.  According to you, who makes you sick to the stomach?
