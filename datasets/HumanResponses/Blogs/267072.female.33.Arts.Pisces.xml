      The man thinks God speaks through him. He reportedly told a group of Amish, "I trust God speaks through me. Without that, I couldnâ€™t do my job."  Huh? So now he is a prophet???   Riiiiiiiiiight...  What a fucking asshole!

      Get used to it, this man and his ego piss me off.  He was asked in today's debate with Howard Dean how he planned on getting enough electoral votes to win this election. First he runs on about how he can, then he drones on about how this is about beyond November.   Ok Ralph, yeah this election is more important that how many votes you can collect. It is about what happens after November. This time around it is way too important to get that idiot out of the white house so that what little civil liberties we still have now, we will still have four years from now. Stop being such an egotist!  Then at the end of today's debate, Mr. Nader promoted his new book.... is that what him running for office this time around is really about? Selling books... must be since he knows damn well he can't get the votes to actually win!  What a fucking asshole!

      He makes this list because well damn it the shoe fits...  No, he is not my ex as in we were once married. We went out in high school when I was 15. I broke up with him back then because he kept going out with 13 year olds at the same time. Mind you he was 17 and a few months from being 18 at the time. Yes, this was before I had any children. I guess no one actually sat back and thought about the fact that I had a child by someone else before I had a child by this loser. The very good reason behind that is because I didn't really want anything more to do with the cad who always cheated even back then. I got pregnant by someone else and had my heart broke by that same someone else and the jerk I dated before him took advantage of the situation and left me to raise not one child by myself, but two. He was an asshole back then too.  So why does he make this list now? Well because he told his current wife that I'm jealous because he never married me. What a fucking ego! I could have stayed with him in high school if I really wanted to marry him. The only time after I had a child by him that I expressed wanting to marry him was out of despiration when I found out what a monster my husband at that time was. Unless you count the time that I told him I would not raise his two sons K&C unless he married me so he better get that notion out of his head.   Anyone who marries that man is fuckin stupid if you ask me. He has sired ten kids now and he doesn't feel he should have to help support any of them. Who in their right fucking mind would want to marry a man who shirks his responsibilities like that? Not me, that's for damn sure and it's damn egotistical to think that I would want to. Once upon a time maybe I thought I did but that was a long time ago... disgust and contempt have left no room for any such emotion from me for him ever again. He deliberately hurts anyone who is stupid enough to love him. Including but not limited to his blood family.   Yes indeed, what a fucking asshole!

      Oh yeah, if you know me well, you knew this was going to make it here and possibly wondered why he was not the first asshole I wrote about. Well that part is simple, the GOP assholes pissed me off first today.  So what has Nader done to piss me off this time? The same ole shit. Ralph Nader isn't for anything except boosting Ralph Naders ego. Yes, he has done quite a bit for the consumer but that has jack shit to do with running for president. Have you heard some of the bullshit he has spewed in his bid for prez this time around? UGH what an egotistical idiot! Then when it was pointed out to him that in places where it mattered the most for Kerry to win, Nader was actually taking more votes away from Kerry than Bush and his answer to that was that Bush and Kerry were taking votes away from HIM!  WHAT A FUCKING ASSHOLE!!!!!

       You know, the ones who although there was a surplus when Bush took office now claim they inherited a recession from the previous administration. WTF is up with that? How in the hell were we in a recession if there was a surplus and the economy was doing so good Bush felt he could give all that money back to the people? Did I miss something? Our economy went down hill  after  Bush and company were asleep at the wheel while Al-Queda flew plans into the WTC Towers and Pentagon as I recall.    And now just two days after Kerry announces Edwards as his VP running mate here we are again with the undetermined threat announcements. *sigh* Oh yeah, we have nothing new to report, no new threats specifically but it's ganna getcha. I'm so sick of the GOP using terrorists as the modern day boogie man every single time they want attention. These fuckers are more paranoid than crackheads!  Fucking Assholes!

      Today I was sitting on my couch and discussing random people with my husband. Over and over the same theme kept popping up... I kept ending with "what a fucking asshole." Then I told my husband that I should start a blog with that name and so here it is.  What A Fucking Asshole! The Blog.
