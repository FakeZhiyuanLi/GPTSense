      I am known to do some really dumb things every now and then.  Paul will often ask, "So what was your Jessica Simpson moment today?"  I of course get all offended and tell him I am not that dumb.  However, there is a huge list of dumb moments in my life. You can do something dumb once and be excused from it, but do it twice and you are in trouble.  So one day quite some time ago I went shopping.  I went to what we call "the cheap store", a food for less kind of store.  I like apples but I like them to be really shiny and no spots or dents.  I was picking out some apples, all of which were not up to my standard.  I reached for one way in the middle of the pile and I heard a rumble.  All of the sudden all the apples came tumbling down onto the ground.  I wanted to crawl in a whole or run away.  Unfortunately I was surrounded by apples, there was no escaping.  A worker guy came over, very upset and began to pick up the apples and put them in carts.  When he was finished there were three shopping carts full of apples.  Of course I didn't want any now, they were all bruised.  So the other day I am at the same store looking through the shabby selection of apples.  I had three in my bag already when I heard that little rumble.  At that point I made a quick get away and decided three apples was all I wanted.    I have learned my lesson, only pick apples from the top!  I am really L A M E

      Everyone is capable of making the world a better place...so what would you do?  I am on a mission.  I want to make my life better.  I want to wake up every morning and jump out of bed eager to make a difference. However, I am still trying to work out the detail...like how am I going to make it better.  Picking up trash is not really my thing.   This may seem really lame to all two of you who are reading this, but I don't care.   You got to believe its getting better, its getting better all the time.

      Since I have been on vacation for about a month now, I have been doing a lot of nothing.  Don't get me wrong I really enjoy doing nothing, at times.  However, I have discovered you can't do nothing forever...or at least I can't. I am looking forward to returning to work and feeling normal again.   I did have some excitement in the beginning of my vacation. I went on an awesome vacation with Paul's family to the East Coast. It was a great time. Paul's dad drug us all around New York and we saw everything!  It was a blast!  Since then I have not really done much -- taking some online courses ....pretending to be a college student again (terrible), and spending time in my new house (which I love).  I have had some time to think while unplugged from reality. I have figured out that life is what you make it...it can be good or it can be bad.  Yeah, I know this is not rocket science...but it is me trying to be somewhat DEEP.  So what is it for you?  It is good for me.
