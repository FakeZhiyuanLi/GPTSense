       Hi there guys, Please could you pray for our little church, I don't know how many people I have spoken to about this, so forgive me if I have. As a church we have been meeting in a youth centre for the last 13 years. 2 years ago an Old church building in the centre of Welshpool Town went on sale, with the Lords amazing provision and guidance we have purchased and renovated it. We are moving in this weekend!!! From next Monday to Friday we are opening up the church to visitors from 10 am to 2pm, then having evangelistic meetings at 7.30pm. Then having a Thanksgiving service on the Saturday at 3pm. Please please pray for us.... That we will be ready as a church to recieve non believing visitors into our building and know what to say and how to say it, and that people will come to the special meetings, and that the Lord in His mercy will save people. We are so thankful to God for his provision, and we are now so aware of the responsibility that now goes with it. Lots of people have been interested in what we have done, especially as some of the older folk from the town remember going there as children, or have even got married there. This is a great opportunity to invite them back, and for them to hear the gospel. Any way, thats all for now, will try and update you as the week progresses. Love and God bless, Ruth.

       Reviewing what Carole wrote reminded me to comment on our family mealtimes. It seemed for a while that we were eating together even less often than we had been before the holiday - we spent a few days away with friends (who incidentally were eating together more now - their son is old enough to mess up the "grown-up" mealtimes they used to have once their children were in bed - so that was progress for them [and also incidentally we met Aidan Severs and Alison at St. Thomas' in Lancaster when we went with our friends on the Sunday after Carey - should have mentioned that before - small world {or big family}]).  But then when we got home, we just didn't sit down together at all, it seemed. So we made a slightly more conscious effort - which did lead to some times of "family tension", notably on the Sunday (what is it about Sunday lunches? I know - it's that they are an hour later than normal, and people's blood-sugar gets low. Either that or it's a good time for Satan to undermine God's gift to us in the preceding couple of hours. Or both.) but did at least have us eating together! We have used the opportunity of the Olympics to have "family fun" in front of the television, which basically involves us all cheering "Freddy! Freddy!" or "Teddy! Teddy!" at any British competitors that are taking part, with the odd scream thrown in for good measure. What a blessing a detached house is.

       Thank you for having me/us.  First, Carey was excellent, again - we really value the chance to talk through things with wise other Christians, to be challenged, to be taught, to sing and so on - particularly in our more isolated Christian situation. As I said elsewhere, I found John B. on Acts 2:42-47 particularly helpful - though the fact that I was looking after Charis in bed on the Wed evening meant I didn't get to hear the sermon that everybody else is talking about. I'll listen to it over ironing soon .... yes, some men do iron! (occasionally)  Secondly, can I make a suggestion? If you have the internet nouse to do this, you could also contribute to bulletin boards. Did you know there are boards out there where people are still able to debate real things as though opinions matter - even argue? Very non-post-modern! For a long time, I haunted  The Independent  argument board, and was able to get into discussions about morality, sexuality, science "vs" religion etc. It was a real meeting place of ideas - a modern areopagus. I even set up my own bulletin board at areopagus.co.uk for a while - but it never really attracted any attention, even from the Christians I told about it. So.... if you feel you can argue for Christianity, go and find a bulletin board to talk on as well. Fellowship is great - and the fellowship we have had through Carey is amongst the best we have known - but we are called to evangelism as well. Let us know how you get on! Let us know if you need help in a particular discussion!  Paul F.

       As Andrew King reminded us at The Concert, I need a clean break. I have gone back to where I really belong: De Eside. I will try to resist the temptation to make further postings to this Blog for at least one year ... in your dreams!  Z

       Hello people! Sorry for the delay in inviting everyone to post but there were a number of technical hitches, now sorted. If you were at the CFC this year and Dave J had your email address then you should by now have received an invite to post. Apologies if you haven't, but it may be that we only had an old address - contact someone who has our email, update your contact details with us and you shall receive an invitation to the ball!  We are now looking forward to a mini reunion of Careyites in York at Emily's concert on the 30th, though it would be helpful if we knew where and what time the concert was - perhaps someone can post details!  My life has been taken up since last Friday with the new addition to the Jarrett family - Kitty - no, not a kitten (don't I wish) but a pony. She's an Arab Cob cross 14.2 hands high, chesnut, and spoiled rotten. She is proving to be quite a challenge - claustrophobic and nappy (nothing to do with what goes on the rear end of babies). I am experiencing a sharp learning curve and getting used to such expressions as "skipping out" (no ropes), "fresh", "de-botting" (this involves a sharp knife) and other such wonderful phrases. At the moment Leah is taken up with all things ponyish and intends entering the Usk Agricultural Show - particularly the fancy dress (as Postman Pat and Jess his cat - and Leah is Jess). I, of course, will have to work out how we turn a small horse into a postman.  On a different note, Simon went off to EMW under canvas camp today with Sam Holland. Since Ann's talk on family meal-times together we have made more of an effort, particularly reading from the Bible and catechising. A talk on providence (What are the providences of God?) was a good opportunity to bring home the gospel. Please pray for Simon as he experiences camp, and for Leah, that they would find the Saviour for themselves, and particularly for Andrew - my 20 year old - that my talking to him about Tim Wells conversion may have started him thinking. (Tim and Andrew were last at Carey together 5 years ago.)  Well, time to finish - I have to be up at 5.45am to pick up Andrew from his night-shift at Festive Productions. He's making tinsel for Â£6.00 an hour. He comes home with his pockets full of tiny bits of the stuff which end up all over the house - it's like Christmas without the fun bit.

        Having just had a peek at Careyteens I feel a bit like a voyeur! "Seeing" teenagers speak is weird, after all they mostly grunt at home and never express personal feelings, so seeing them confessing their deepest, darkest longings is sooo strange.     I must admit that I tend to get PCF (post-Carey Frustration) as we return to a diet of 18th and 19th century hymnody. If I want to taste the music of the earlier part of the 20th century we have to turn up 20 minutes before the service for a time of chorus singing.  I also get PCR ( post-Carey Resolutionitis ) when I make firm decisions to be able to play the drums, electric and/or bass guitar, recorder, piano, etc, etc to at least grade 6 by next Carey.Once again Carey (FC) came and went...the coming took oh such a long time the "went" confirmed it as the fastest week of the year (moan).  The ministry, music and meeting of folk was awesome (to pinch a teenage expression), and I still think on AK's preaching on Ps 2 which did result in that overwhelming sense of the presence of God which kept us fixed to our seats and silenced. Ann and Cora were also fantastic - practical and wise. It gave us ladies a chance to share problems and ask questions.  As usual the Carey Concert proved to be a hotbed of talent - oh, our young, young people! What with Jacob, Lauren, Georgina, Robert.....teens watch out the talent is closing fast! Tom K as Peter Cook sounded just like his dad! There was a good balance of music this year - it wasn't dominated by any one particular style or family!  Fellowship with folk was excellent. How good it is for brothers (and sisters) to dwell together! What more reason to look forward to next year's Carey, it's biblical! To catch up with people's news and to see answers to prayer from the previous years CFC.... Pat and John and their new son Aaron, Andrew and Sarah and their new daughter Bethany, God is good, and we played a part in our prayer support! Amazing! The ladies time of prayer was good too - a first for CFC since I've been involved - it was an opportunity to bring those more personal things to the Lord. We will continue to remember Debbie, Susan, Emma and Giselle before Him.  Well this ends my first entry. Haven't got a clue what I'm doing really, just feeling my way. Apologies to Larry Norman for messing with his song title as the title for this posting!
