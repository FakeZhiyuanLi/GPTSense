      not a perfect person i never meant to do those things to you and so i have to say before i go that i just want you to know i found out a reason for me to change who i used to be a reason to start over new and that reason is you i found out a reason to show a side of me you didn't know a reason for all that i do and the reason is YOU*cue*[SCREEEEEAAAAMMMMMM ARGHHHH THAT SONG ROCKS!!!!]* i'm happy again!and here i come!returning to you,sweet blog,with a freaking big smile ahhaha.... well coz exams are like half-over..oh wait.pmr's not over yet.oh well later le.=p compared to yesterday when i decided to write a VERY bleak blog and hit 'publish post'..i changed my mind and came back writing a happy one lol. one thing though..i really do miss him.i mean..i don't wanna take too much of anyone's time i know it's not nice..everyone needs a little time alone..well that's what they say. aikz.at least i got to see him today..even though it was just for a short while..i can't imagine how much i miss him.less and less time to spend with each other due to EXAM and..this year would be so busy!sigh..have to do something.need to get that message across.need to feel him there with me.it's not that i don't..i do know he's there.just that it's abit far away.hmm well it felt TOTALLY better today!haha..i guess it's coz the way he does all those little things for me..like waiting for me after school and everything.i wish cheer 2004 would be alright..hope that it'll turn out fine..hey,another day to cheer and celebrate togetha before going back to study..ugh.  STRESS!! eheh..and then germany HAS to lose.sigh. i've been a good girl lol..these few days i guess.been studying.and now here lying on my stomach with my elbows propped up to type this.ooh..starting to ache. okay..wonder what he's doing now? ya know, at the end of the day..that smile of his is just..rewarding..and whenever i look at him i think 'yeah..that's my sweetheart,that's my guy..'...

      someone used to tell me(still does actually)that i'm still young, and i DON'T know what a romantic-love relationship is.CRAP.can't stand it when they start that.who says i..or we don't know what's that about?don't know why older people think of us like we don't know what we're doing and we're STILL VERY VERY YOUNG...like we haven't been through anything before.guess that statement is SO wrong...and i can bet alotta ppl like me will feel the same.ish! =p .I believe in a thing called love.no reason.simply coz there's a reason for me to love..and get loved in return 2..eh..guess there ARE a lotta different kinds of love....mmph well define them yourself , d.aight..in tune with everything going on in my life now..it would be pretty tough without God helping me and him.and a few other people who care for me.woah.what a long week i had.but glad to have a space to write stuff..rather dunk it all here then inside my heart.do me a favour and send this to him - je t'aime - had a lovely talk last night..well actually this morning haha.i just didn't realize how much i miss him already!  i love dreaming! =)*wink^angel**  God bless--

      my gosh i'm aching all over. back pain, totally tired..and headache's still here.i tried resisting to write in you bloggy, but guess i can't. coz i know once i blog in you i'll be breaking down again.what the heck. i'll just leash it out here. Look..i've tried my best. i hope that we're still together..and i'll give him all the freedom he wants and needs. It doesn't matter about me..i just want him to be happy. I don't know what to do...i try to cheer him up..try not to seem like a over-freakish girlfriend who doesn't know what a crap to do. ARGHH DAMN IT! my heart really like..hurts you know?yesterday when it happened i could feel my body burning up..and it so scared me! i never felt like that before! never felt so scared in my entire life! i could practically feel something burning inside..arghhh...i feel my tears every night now. it's so dumb..so unreal..i've never been so hurt and felt so rejected ever before in my life. and to think that besides God,he was the closest person to me here. He never did this to me before..back then when i blurted everything out to him he could take it...the way he does it he always has a way with things. and suddenly everything just changed like that. i wish i didn't have to start about it last night. if we didn't talk about it none of that would've happened and i won't be here trying to find a way to cry my heart out online.i've cried so much i've already dried up inside...and i found out scars on my body i never knew there was. it's so scary..God gave me strength to get through all of this..and he gave me a special angel to take care of me.that angel---->him.i remember everything..when i said' you're my angel, dear'..he just smiled and he understood.what happens now?i've tried my best..tried to make it work..but nothing seems to come out correct anymore. before this everything was so wonderful..everything just seemed so beautiful..all the more..everyday i see him i feel so blessed..that if i could only hear him speak to me for a second i'd be happy enough. i know God loves me..more than anything..and i'm glad i'm never alone.not for a second. even through the terribly hard patches of my freakin life now..my Father up there's taking care of me and loving me. It's just so hard to feel this..to take it all in..i don't know how long more i can stand this. i thank God for such a wonderful guy in my life..a sweet boyfriend to love me and to take care of me in every way. that God is so wonderful,i love you so much Jesus. It's times like these i feel so incredibly lonely..and the pain is so hard to bear!i keep hearing the words in the morning..i remember clearly every morning when i wake up angel's name would be the thing in my mind..and this morning when i woke up, i nearly broke down. i couldn't believe how much i actually loved him..more than i ever knew. i realized that it wasn't a dream..and i knew i how deep i'd actually fallen for this guy. God knows what i have to do now...i'm trying to study..my calling. i'm trying to concentrate well on my sch work..my calling. i'm trying..i really am..but it really makes things hard to know that someone i love doesn't feel the same way anymore. i don't know what to say. what else can i say?i can't say anything..except pray and wish that somehow..God would show me the light and tell me whether i should still go on doing this. it hurts..everything. even when i dried my hair today..and when i switched on the fan to full blast..and..walking into my house. if i turn my head left and i see the couch...i feel just a stab of pain..like..broke my heart like crap. well..what to do?we'll see where this takes the both of us..and somehow..that he'll be able to love me again..love me..for me.for what i am.coz you know what?i love him so much. i should've told him how much. he doesn't know..dear..i'm sorry.my weakness caused you pain..my fault again.i love you so much..

      i couldn't seem to concentrate properly today!i just can't get him off my mind!!!mmph..my poor dear..i hope he gets well soon.can't wait to go visit him...although i don't know how am i gonna do that. i miss him so much!!arghh!!!wish i could be there now holding him.=) anyway..it was really funny today...i was late for science period with my friends and the teacher made us stand near the door ahhaha..and when she asked us why we were late and wanted to write the blue card and all..my two other friends kena but me n my other fren didn't kena know why?heeh coz i said i felt like throwing up(after that *puke* wayyy too sweet orange juice from the school canteen at recess) and my friend said she was with me.and we got away like that..hehe..but i feel abit guilty lah. oh well...it was quite a slow day...most of the time i was so sleepy....it was such a drowsy day...missing him like every second =/ God bless , dear!je t'aime *muahX*

      i started writing already.for the mph competition thing..you know?i'm getting a little chilly here right now.sitting on the little stairs next to my phone.mmph.what a day..ahaha...first thing in the morning it was SO nice.just wish he was there though.and it was raining and raining and raining.hehe..cold...and cosy...sigh.i'll tell you something though, when i was there right beside him that day..it felt so right.guess i've said this many times before...but that's what it is.i watched him as i sat awake..and he looked so sweet!i felt like..it was forever that kinda thing.people fall in love and stay in love because they want to make the love work...i believe that.it's like the reward at the end of the day to work hard over the week and to be able to sit side by side telling each other our feelings.=) i'm not complaining about the time now...i know he's busy..i've been busy myself too...sigh..what with all the exams coming up...but me will learn to cope better with it!knowing the fact that he loves me already means a lot.well..guess what happened today.found a couple in a class when i walked in.ehhe..how embarrasing..ish..i dunno whether i should be embarrased or them ahahha... it's interesting to see what motivation can do!i've been starting to throw myself into my work now, writing more than ever..well at least trying to hahaha...and hoping to catch up better with all the school work i've missed.mmph. know what?he&nbsp;MELTS me! &nbsp; oh gosh..i miss him so much..

      bloggy, i keep dreaming about him. often now. feeling him beside me, knowing he's there. do you know? yesterday was one of the hardest things i ever had to do in my life. he called me 'wei'. my gosh.he never calls me that..i mean...usually it's pet names..i was so shocked.. just to hear that voice call my name again..and argHH!i mean, if he had said it the usual way we call each other it'd be fine.but yesterday..it came out sounding like a stranger..what happened?how can a relationship just break down like that? i guess it's my fault..i'm sorry dear won't you forgive me? it hurt. so badly.when i had to just turn away..i wanted to smile at you..wanted to say hi back..but i couldn't..i just couldn't...it felt so strange talkin to you like that. why?? i know my Father's listening..i know He's hearing me... please..get me out of this...

My friends signed my wall when they came to my house that day..but nothing beats the big 'je't aime'..with that big signature beside. i wish..someone would tell me this is all a big nightmare. i see him smiling and laughing along with his friends...like nothing happened.i'm happy,and freakin sad at the same time. happy that he's able to smile like everything's still fine..and sad to think that he had given up so easily.. sigh..none of this is working out bloggy.. drama practice sucks...i don't know what to do to make it better...and studies...trials are in two weeks time..when's his?i hope he's studying well too..i so wish i can sms him to encourage him...but i think it's better to lay off now for a while..sigh.

      I figured something out today. After coming home from church, i sat down beside the stereo, played FGA's tracks and cried my heart out. Everything's going freakin wrong in my life now, but there was one thing i realized.. As FGA youth put it: "Though i may stumble..though i may fall..you'll NEVER give up on me."such a revelation.God's there for me..i know He's understanding what i feel right now.I felt him especially nearer than ever before, coz' this patch of my life is one of the darkest times. I have a guy whom i hold dearly in my heart. A total God-loving, God-fearing guy.My guy. Met him a year back, and we became so close..prolly even closer than any real sister and brother.Besides God, he was the only other person who was willing to hear me out and hear my cries everytimje some guy broke my heart or what. And now, when it's him who did it..i'm totally lonely.feeling sucks.For me, falling in love with a person that deeply..it's like a starting of a blissful and sweet chapter in my life..for love itself brings that much joy into someone's life.And the extra bonus was this sweetheart of mine is a true believer of God.He helped me more in my walk and faith spritually, and i felt so unbelievably blessed to have a person like him to love.Everyday when i wake up i can smile knowing that Jesus is right up there watching over me, and that He has blessed me with the fact that i have a special someone to share my life with. I guess..time accounts for most of the things. imagine..your own boy comes right up to you and say 'i don't know whehter i love you'. how MUCH would that hurt? just think! someone you love, so much, who you hoped would always stand strong in the love relationship you have together, suddenly just crashes everything down in just 5 seconds of typing. Tell you honestly..i wouldn't know how to put it into words how i felt-or how i feel now. All i can say is, the pain is so bad i can feel it physically.like something burning inside my body.What do i do konw?where do i go from here? even when i close my eyes and like,dream..i see him.that smile. the times we spent in each other's arms. and it's a shock..i wake up crying like crap..i don't know how to stop. i can't believe this is happening.. I'm really suffering now..but i try my best not to show it. i've lost my appetite..can't eat anything much. it's so unreal! Been crying every morning every night,when i think about it, and even when i pray about it. I've..never been so hurt before in my entire life. i thought he would've known...he would've known how deep the hurt would be...after being through so much with me.. But all this while i know that God is hearing me, and i've prayed..loadsa times before..for a way out, and..is this what you want for me Lord? Do i continue in this..? I keep waiting..coz i'm sure He'll answer my prayers. I asked for love before, to give others more love, and he answered my prayer- send mt with an angel in form of a loving boyfriend. But now that..well, he decided to..take time off..everything's just different. I..really love this guy. I know that it's not going to be easy...and i'll try to get through this. I've made a decision.. wanna hear? - If i still love this guy..i'll just continue loving him. i won't try to force myself to do otherwise.If this is what he wants..or what he feels it's right, let it be. Only God knows what He wants for the both of us. To my Father in Heaven..thank you for being there for me every step of the way and loving me..i love you more than anything else in this world.  and..to my sweet angel out there..i don't know what you're doing now, i just hope you're safe. i know that God's looking after you..and..hope your arm will recover soon.you may or may not know this..but i still love you, always have and always will.i still dream about you..and that day when i walked in the park..it was drizzling..[remember you said you dreamt about that scene with us in it before]all i could think of was..why?You said i'll have to be prepared for anything that happens in a love BGR relationship...i'm ready. check this out.."...never to awaken love before it is ready."song of songs 8:4. I'm leaving everything in God's mighty hands.
