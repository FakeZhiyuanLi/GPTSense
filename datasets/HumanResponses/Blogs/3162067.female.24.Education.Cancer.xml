						   I feel it in the water; the crystal vibrations of my mother's beating heart. "Chihiro-chan" she says to me.  "Why have you forgotten us?  Why do you block us out from your mind?" In each cherry blossom I see the ghost of her sad, dark eyes coming alive with a moment of recognition.  'My daughter, my daughter," she sighs with the wind, and I turn away.  I am not hers.  I haven't been hers for so long now. I am the daughter of the Tameha-okiya now; the beloved first daughter of Gion. Kyoto holds me at night now; closely, but not too familiarly.

						   I was five years old when I last saw my parents. Their faces are no longer with me. The passage of time means that they are but blurred shadows now, dancing in the edges of my sight. My father. My mother. Lost to me. When I was a little girl, they called me Chihiro-chan.  I was their youngest, their miracle. My mother was an old woman, I'm told. I don't remember her age. I don't remember. I have a sudden attack of doubt. Perhaps it is wrong of me to be speaking out so. Perhaps I should retreat back into the Flower and Willow world, and keep my silence.  But my world now is dying: what is there to lose by sharing my life.  When I am gone, this will be the only part of me to live on.

      It has been such an annoying day today. I woke up this morning in pain and knew I couldn't make it into work. I was really annoyed as I desperately feel ready to return now and I'm actually missing my job. I miss my pupils too. Anyhow, I made a doctors appointment and after an hour of waiting he saw me. He phoned the hospital to find out my test results but they hadn't been sent for analysis while I was there (er...what's the point in doing them then?) They now no longer exist so my diagnosis, whilst being likely, of a kidney infection is not definite. My doctor thinks it could also be problems with my spine that is causing me pain, but again he's not sure. It's really reassuring isn't it, when you're in pain and no-one really knows why. What he was fairly sure of was that I had been prescribed with too strong a medication, which, if I did have a kidney infection, would have cleared it up. However, it's also likely that in turn that medication is causing me the pain I'm currently in (think of 2 common conditions women suffer from, then add to that that the doctor said on examination that it's the worse case he's ever seen, and you get the picture.) A side effect of these antibiotics, apparantly. Considering that the doctors at the hospital knew that I have a history of these complaints, you'd think that they would have prescribed me something milder, or at least warn me in advance. So there we have it. Nobody knows for sure what's giving me this pain, the medication has made it worse, there's a lot of guess work going on and nobody's entirely convinced how to make the pain stop (although my Doctor thinks stopping the antibiotics will make a positive difference.) Filling out my sick note is going to be fun! As a diagnosis of Kidney infection was given, my Dr thinks we should work on the assumption that that's what I had; especially as the antibiotics did make a bit of a difference. Personally, I'm not too bothered on knowing the medical name, but I would certainly feel a lot happier if they could tell me the pain will stop. Doesn't the medical profession fill you with confidence? I'm going to lie down now with a couple of painkillers and a hot water bottle, and hopefully the pain will soon subside.

      Still off work, but planning to go back tomorrow as being home alone is actually giving me rage and making me feel quite down in the dumps.  Thankfully it seems that I don't have Norwalk at all: I phoned the doctor and he said that I didn't have enough of the symptoms. What I do have the symptoms of, however, is someone who has recently had several different dyes and medications injected into her. So it's just a side-effect of those tests they did on me. Phew. Although, to be honest, I do feel a lot better today. It's still uncomfortable to breathe in too deeply, but I should be ok soon. I never thought I'd say that I missed work, but there we go. Bronte was a little too rough with her playing today and clamped her teeth on either side of my finger. It didn't hurt in the slightest - she literally wrapped her whole jaw around it and I could feel her teeth meet on the other side, but she's never done that before. I think she was getting too excited. Just typing up some worksheets to help my year 9's with their SATs revision. I'm not terribly hopeful about that class, but their attitude is largely to do with it. Anyway, I'd better press on.

      Ooooh, I never should have discharged myself from hospital! The pain in my stomach is just as bad...well, I tell a lie; this morning it was ok but last night agony, I feel, would be an apt word. I'm off again today and will be tomorrow too, though I'm determined to go back in on Friday. That's the horrible thing about being off sick: the longer you're off, the more difficult it is to go back in. Plus the knowledge that i've missed out on the last few pre-SATs lessons with my Year 9s has upset me a lot. But what can I do? I think I have caught the Norwalk virus. According to the news yesterday, there was an outbreak in the hospital over the weekend, whilst I was there. In terms of my health, there is really nothing to worry about. It's basically a stomach bug which is certainly making things interesting. But it's a big problem at the hospital as it means nursing staff are absent and, obviously, it's quite unpleasant if you've elderly or already very ill. At any rate, I won't be allowed back while I've got it. The irony is, I was joking to Si when I went there that I would catch it. I didn't realise there had actually been another outbreak. So yeah, I've been taking it easy. Si almost had to physically restrain me to stop me from doing the housework. I've been writing more of my rat stories, which has been fun. I've had some really good ideas. Reading them to my Year 7's has certainly helped me, as I now know what sort of things they responded best to. The character of Dervel got the best response, particularly when he says something stupid or completely irrelevent. His line of "I wanted to be an assassin" has achieved cult status almost overnight. I think what makes that line particularly funny is that he is such a hopeless, clumsy, stupid, dozy little thing. I'm very pleased with the characterisation of the rats; they seem to have caught my class's imagination. Snitch (Stitch) the evil despot/genius of the story is one of my own personal favourites, and I'm enjoying developing her character. I've just written a story where she breaks into a school classroom, takes over the class and leads the students in a revolt against the teachers. Makes me chuckle. I read this in the Mirror this morning and it made me laugh, so i thought I'd include it here:  BOOB CASH BID NIPPED IN THE BUD A busty shopper tried to sue mall chiefs after her boobs got trapped in a revolving door. The cheeky bid was among the failed claims revealed yesterday by bosses at Manchester's trafford centre. One chancer demanded compensation for swollen ankles - blaming lack of carpets in the centre. Another wanted clothes after spilling nail varnish on hers while sitting on a mall bench to apply it. And a mum tried to sue for new glasses after her child's coin rebounded off the fountain into her specs.  Doesn't it amaze you. People really astonish me sometimes; the innate ability to be sooo mind-numbingly stupid and greedy has led to such a rise in the compensation culture that common sense seems to have all but deserted the world. This whole 'blame someone else for anything that happens' attitude is ruining the world. It is no more evident anywhere than in school.  Aaaargh. Need to compose myself or I'll get rage, and then I'll sue the newspapers for exposing me to such maddening stories that my brain implodes. Oh - some good news. got accepted by a very good job agency in London that has been highly recommended to me, so that's an excellent step.

      Well, she lives! (despite the best efforts of her doctors). Yes I'm back under my new domain name as the other one disappeared. Now it's only a question of letting you all know the new address and bingo! Bob's your uncle. Weeeeell, I'm off work again, which is beginning to annoy even me.  The reason this time is because I've just spent a rather tedious and painful few days in hoptipal, being prodded, poked and generally examined by doctors. So, while I was out having fun, what were you doing? I'll try to deal with this chronologically. On Friday night I had bad stomach pains. they got steadily worse and I was very uncomfortable. Not much fun for me! I was quite worried as on Saturday I went to Newton Abbot for my falconry experience and I was worried I would miss it. Well, on that morning I decided to go anyway: I'd been looking forward to it for such a long time. Me and Si caught the train to Newton Abbot, then got a taxi to the garden centre where the event was to be held. It was a gorgeous day: the sun was shining and everything looked so beautiul. The garden centre also was very nice. There's something about spending a day in a garden centre that makes you really feel like you're an adult. Despite the fact I have no garden to speak of, we nearly bought a whole heap of plants. Luckily I resisted. The Falconry centre was charming. There were approx 42 birds and sadly security was a bit good, so I couldn't run off with any of them. This in itself was a shame as I was quite taken by the Kestrels. I was surprised at how butterfly-like they were in their movements. Of course, i do want a falcon but they look kinda difficult...so I might one day start with a barn owl. Anyhow, the experience lasted about 3 hours. I got to fly a very talkative Barn Owl (who was chatting to me the whole time), a tawny owl (I want! I want!) another barnie and a harris hawk. The Harris Hawk was a baby and not a good flier. He got frightened and ended up falling on the floor and crying. Then he got tangled up in a tree...what a fusser! Couldn't help but laugh. I also had the experience of an Eagle owl flying into me...it missed my glove and landed on my arm. Ouch. Now, and Eagle owl is very very big (hence the name).  My arm is very little. My arm is now bruised. BUT IT WAS TOTALLY WORTH IT!!!! Now, when I got back my nether regions were still hurting. then I noticed blood in my water. I phoned NHS direct, who told me to ring the out-of-hours doctor. I did so, and went to see him on Sunday morning. After a rather uncomfortable examination he admitted me straight to hospital (to my very great surprise!) and Si got to push me around on a wheelchair. I was taken to a ward in SAU (surgical assessment unit) as they thought it might be appendicitus. It wasn't, thankfully. Then I was subjected to lots and lots of tests, including x-rays, and given some painkillers, then I was pretty much left alone. Si stayed with me a lot but eventually we were told I was going to be kept in overnight. This did not make me very happy. I was distraught when Si went home and had an ok night, attempting to sleep with a big needle in one arm. At about midnight a Scots bloke was brought in and I kept hearing him shout 'Narse! Narse!' which confused the hell out of me until I realised that he was calling the nurse. The next day even less attention was being paid to me. I didn't know what was wrong with me and I was lonely and bored. Scots guy was replaced with scary crusty old guy who kept shouting at the nurses, making unpleasant noises in his throat and kept messing himself. i did feel sorry for him a lot: he got told of by the nurses for shouting at them when it was clear that he only shouted because he was deaf and in a lot of pain. Even his own family seemed to treat him as a burden. But it wasn't very nice. I was allowed to eat by about midday (about 40 hours after I'd last eaten) and they finally decided I'd probably had a kidney stone and passed it, and that had caused a painful kidney and bladder infection, which had also affected my tubes. They put my on antibiotics and left me to it. By the evening I was straining at the bit to get home. When the doctor said I would have to stay in another day I nearly had a fit. No no no no no no! I made him let me go home, by promising I'd come back if the pain got worse and technically perhaps I should have stayed in a bit longer...the pain hadn't cleared up as much as I implied it had. But I was feeling very unwell from just being in the hospital and was desperate to get home to my home comforts. Besides, what's the point in staying in hospital when the only thing being done is that I take one tablet three times a day? Well, I'm happy to be home now but also looking forward to returning to work very much. Hopefully I'll be back on Friday.

      And the road goes ever on and on... Things are getting progressively better, although I can't believe there's still a week left at work before the holiday. I've been thinking about holidays; in a sense I have been spoiled by having so many breaks, and I don't know how I'll manage when I don't have so many. Ha! Poor me. But I strongly suspect that, having reclaimed my evenings and weekends, I won't need so many holidays to recover from term time. The great news is that Marcelle got my job yesterday. I'm am thrilled to bits for her: she deserves it. It's wonderful to know that she finally has a well-deserved permanent job. So reassuring. But it's a very final thing for me. It's sad to think that the department will go on without me; we've been such a team for the past 2 years, and I'm abandoning it. Dammit, I'm fed up of being tired all of the time. My quest to stop drinking caffeine has definitely contributed to this though. I just have to stick with it. Three more jobs to apply for next week, so that as definitely lifted my spirits. Now I will write a lesson for A-level.

      Admittedly a better day today, although it could hardly be getting any worse. I was so exhausted I could barely function, so am about to zonk out on the sofa. But I killed any nastiness with serenity and kindness, which threw the pupils of guard and they were nice to me as a result. Which is good.

      Another crap day. Seriously tempted to not bother going in tomorrow, although I probably will. Keep hoping I'll catch the flu or something so I can stay at home but, regardless, it'll still look poor on my job references, and I'm having a difficult enough time as it is. Sigh. Today's hot discussion in my Year Nine class was whether I had a large vagina or not. Can you believe it? It's an absolute disgrace. I'm so knackered that I can't even be good-humoured about it; it really upset me that they talked about me in such a crass and unkind way. Too tired and defeated to protest or do anything much. Going back to the doctors tomorrow.

      I'm feeling quite nervy and panicked lately. It feels like there's so much to do, and just not enough time. I have so many things I want to do, but I never have time to do them. Drawing, reading, socialising, embroidery, writing (I have about 5 books and 3 short stories I want to write). It is making me feel extremely frustrated and panicky. I know this is largely because of my teaching i.e. I can never do much at the weekend, or relax, because I know I have a lot of planning and marking to do. So glad I'm leaving, but now the transition time is starting, and everything is so unsure. Can't seem to keep still. On Friday I went into town and a starling flew onto my shoulder. I don't know who was more shocked: it or me. It sat on my shoulders for a few seconds, staring at me, then it began to squawk. It looked very annoyed. After a few minutes, it flew away. Daft thing.

      Yawn, it's quite early in the morning. I'm not saying that it's ridiculously early but, considering that it's the weekend, it's earlier than I care to be up. For the last couple of days I have been waking extremely early; it isn't fair, it's the weekend! I managed to change my printer ink yesterday, and the new one is working to an extent, although it's a little pale and for some reason printing takes longer than it used to. It will probably settle out soon. I'm going to go back to bed now and have a bit more of a sleep.

      Just a quick post before I run into town to do battle with WHSmiths and try to get them to replace my printer cartridge for free (ink won't come out any more). I have to disguise the fact that it's been lying around the house for a couple of months, but that's not the point; it didn't work before then anyway. Going to go for a drink with Si when he finishes work. Feel very tired, but quite content at the moment. Nice weekend coming up, and I've just had a good day at work. All is good with the world.

      You know, I was genuinely excited this morning to wake up at 6am to find that the first series of the Animals of Farthing Wood was on tv. I felt about 13 again. And it was the exciting episode, where fox is swept away by debris! Thrilling. The question is, do I want to wake up early again tomorrow morning? More shock at the news of my departure today. I do feel very sad at the thought of leaving, but relieved also. It feels like it's 3am and I'm tired, and I can't go to sleep for a few hours but, when I do, it will be the best sleep ever. I was thrilled to just receive an email from TFPL agency asking if I wanted to be put forward for a job. It looks like a good job too; the only problem is that it's temporary. If there's a possibility it might lead to something permanent I'd go for it. I'm torn between going for it anyway because I as yet don't have a job, or holding on and waiting. Does look like a cool job though. I've gone all day just drinking water. I'm ever so proud of myself. I am now deliberately leaving my purse at home so I'm not tempted to nip to the shop to get a bottle of coke. Dammit, I will beat my caffeine addiction this time! I can't let it beat me. Ugh, stiff neck. Might go and bake some more Anzacs now. Last night's batch were yummy (but a bit burnt) but then again, the recipe was new...

      Well, hello there again. It's a rainy Tuesday afternoon and I'm feeling more than a little braindead after yesterday's incredibly long day. We got back at about 9pm but, bearing in mind that I hadn't actually been asleep before then, I was aching all over, covered in bruises and deliriously tired. Thankfully a good nights sleep seems to have put paid to all that, although this morning I was doing my very best zombie impression. A good day at work. My classes (except my lower year sevens) were really well behaved. Bizarrely, my year 9's responded very well to the classical music I played them (I want them to write a story in response to 'O Fortuna'). They really enjoyed it. I guess they never really have the opportunity to listen to it at home. My year 7's, though, were evil. Not my good group of girls: they're always nice, but the rest of them were pains! I made one girl cry by shouting at her (of which I am not proud) and also made another girl clean the whole classroom after she had been messing about (which I am proud of). One lad said to me: "Miss, would you ever throw a blackboard-rubber at me?" I replied of course not. When he asked why I thought I'd play Miss Nice Teacher and said "Because if it hit you it might hurt you and that would upset me." He thought for a second and then added "and I'd sue you." Nice. Incidentally, he's one of the worse behaved kids in the class. It's always the badly behaved ones who bandy around veiled threats of 'I'll sue you' if you so much as say anything to get them to calm down. Funny that. After school my two 'writer' students came to see me. Dan has written an excellent short story, which I fully expect to see published one day. Considering he's 15, he is very talented. I like mentoring those two. It feels like I'm passing on my few remaining pearls of wisdom.

      Hmm. Blogger has been busy making some changes and I'm really confused. I don't know how it is at your end, dear reader, but I feel a little on the lost side. At the moment it's 1.20am on a Sunday night. What the hell am I doing up this late? I hear you ask. Well, I could ask myself the same question. It's a good question. All I want to do now is sleep. But at 3.45am Si and I are catching a bus to London to have a few agency interviews, and I just know that if I go to sleep now I am unlikely to wake up in time. So instead, I will sleep on the bus. Dear God, I hope I can sleep on the bus. We plan to arrive early so we can get a decent seat. I'm kinda banking on the fact that there won't be many lunatics like us who are contemplating travel this early in the morning. I had so many plans of things to do to keep me awake, but now they all seem to be dissolving. I think I'll have a bath. Well, a shower might be better, as there's less chance of me drowning in a shower. God, I'm getting old. In my pre-teacher days I would have thought nothing of staying awake 'til the wee hours. In fact, going to bed at 2am was the norm. Even quite recently (well, a year ago) I could happily stay awake 'til at least 1am, and not even feel tired. Now I'm just about ready to pass out. Think a cigarette and a caffeinated drink might be in order now.

      I am at home in the afternoon again! Makes me so mad. Today my pain was very bad, so I taught my lessons at work and then came home at lunchtime. I had no lessons this afternoon, and I will go to work as normal tomorrow, but I will not over-exert myself. Well, my return to work hasn't been all that bad, you know. Apart from the incident of the vile student with a vendetta against me (which I feel has set my recovery back a little as I was beginning to be on the mend), I've quite enjoyed a lot of it. My lower set year 10s and my year 9s were, ugh, soul-destroying, but the rest has been ok. VM, in my tutor group, has even asked me to bring back my rat story book, so she can read it herself. This is such a big thing for her: she is so painfully shy it's without a doubt the most she's ever said to me in the 2 years I've been her teacher. It surely makes the heart swell! The one sad thing is that the news of my imminent departure is slowly seeping around the school. Two of my favourite pupils overheard the receptionists talking about it and boy; are these girls not happy with me! They are devestated. Another year 8 girl asked me about it today. I'm not sure quite what to do now. I didn't really want to break it to anyone before I went. Oh well. I'm going to go and have a bath now.

      Much as I have wanted to return to work, having been off sick for so long I now find myself very very anxious at the thought of returning. I've just spent a couple of hours planning my A-level lessons, and I'm about to mark some homework and do the rest of my planning, and about a thousand things are running through my head. Must remember to do this; must remember to speak to so-and-so about this, what's waiting for me in my pigeon-hole?, what stuff do I have to prioritise? I must admit that it makes me feel quite sick. I'm just about to email those two job agencies with regards to my interview next Monday. The thought that this teaching life will soon be behind me is virtually all that keeps me going, although I'd feel a whole lot easier about it if I had a job.

      Good God, I'm famished. Think it's time to turn on the oven and cook up some ultra-fattening ciabatta bread! Well, I got home from Exeter about 2 hours ago. I think the journeying really took it out of me: i was very pained on the way home and just got in a taxi from the bus station to take me straight home. Si went to his dad's to email his cv to a few people. I'm exhausted now, but have taken some painkillers too. Ken Dodd was very funny. Me, Si, mum and nan went to see him perform in Torquay last night. He was really very good, but I couldn't laugh too much because it hurt! His show went on for so long! It was 2 and a half hours before the interval. We'd heard that the show would go on until about 1am, but none of us could stand sitting there for so long, and I was in agony, so we went home. It was already about 10.30pm by this point. The drive home was a bit scary. There was so much mist and fog that at times I was a little...anxious, shall we say (no disrespect to mum's driving skills.) Those winding, leaf-covered roads...I could well imagine that at any time we might drive out of the mist and find ourselves in 1952, like Brigadoon. Si and I spent all too short a time with the family before coming back today. We mooched around Exeketer for a few hours and Si had to use all of his skills to prevent me from buying an army of mice (sooo cute and scruffy). I doubt Dervel would have appreciated the competition anyway. Spoilsport. I did, however, buy a skirt from monsoon, which now means I have a whole ensemble. Hurrah!

      Today has been a very sweet, settled day. Relaxing. Carol (my boss) said some very nice things and we laughed together. She is a very friendly boss to have, and very approachable. She said that she would have to put up a barrier to stop me leaving and that the school would hold me hostage. I was glad to reassure her that I was devestated to go which, despite some decidely shaking moments, I will be in my heart. I've enjoyed a lot of my time with the school and severel times a day I'm told by a student that they will miss me. Today I have had a pretty day: one of those days where you glide through life on a cloud of beauty and rose water, receiving compliments left and right with the graceful air of a fairytale princess. These days don't happen often enough but, when they do, it's quite nice. Did make one of my students go flustered though: I'm too beautiful. Tonight I will do no homework and no housework. Instead, I will write out a few job-applications and I will write some of my book. It is so much what I want to do in life.

      Well, my back is finally beginning to feel better. The osteopath did some crunching and some acupuncture and it hurt like hell immediately after (although, strangely, not at the time...) But over the weekend the pain has definitely been easing off, so that's good! My neck is stiff now though, so I won't spend much time on the computer. As it is, I have some exam papers to mark anyway.

      I have discovered Krispey Kremes donuts, and the lord proclaimed: they are GOOD! I found them in Harrods yesterday when I popped in to see if I could buy any of those sausages from Jimmy's Farm (unlikely, as I couldn't remember his name) and bought a box for me and Si to share. They disappeared quickly. Well...my interview yesterday. I can honestly say I don't know how it went, which probably means it didn't go all that well. Let's face it, if you're not coming out of an interview filled with confidence it's unlikely you got the job. The first bit went well, when I was telling them about my skills and qualifications. They seemed impressed, and I even made them laugh a few times. Then when it came to job-specific skills they started asking me such basic questions that I was a little gob-smacked. I'm sure there were lots of awkward silences as my brain desperately asked itself: is this a trick question? I probably came across as a complete moron. I think I did ok on the skills test though. All I can do now is wait. I should know by next week. I also have to finish my on-line application form for the market researchers job, but I can't remember the web address so I'll have to search for that one. Other than that, I popped into the British museum for an hour and saw the costumes used in the film Troy: they were cool. I also visited my houses of worship: Monsoon and Lush. They symbolize cool London living to me. I played a few rounds of my least favourite game: tube hopping (where you get on a tube then off at the next stop, then realise you got off at the wrong stop and wait for the next one.) The train ride home was ok, although I didn't get back 'til gone midnight. Having said that, I wasn't very tired. See, I can cope with the London lifestyle. Today was a good day at work. Everyone seems so relaxed and happy. I've found the kids to be very pleasant company. I think I'll miss them more than I thought. I know they will miss me. Today was also the lesson I'd been planning with Carol. She came in and gave a lovely speech about how great the class was, questioned them about their recent work and they did me proud. Then she revealed she was wearing my 'Snitch for President' t-shirt, which got a big cheer. Then we handed out bars of chocolate and awards to the students: I gave out the fimo rats I'd made some students. They were incredibly touched. It was very heart-warming. Right, I have to go back to the osteopath now (and not a minute too soon).

      Tomorrow is the day of my big interview, and suddenly I'm very nervous. I've just printed off a load of history for the company and today I have been refreshing my memory with regards to Powerpoint and Excel. I am now convinced I am not going to get this job. Ugh, and an early start tomorrow. Wish I already had a job. A nice day at work today. The students were very well behaved and there was a lot of joking and courtesy. Admittedly, a boy also set fire to a girl's hair this afternoon...my school really is unbelievable. The sad thing is that this incident failed to shock me. Well, I am going to do a little marking then attempt to relax. I want to be nice and refreshed tomorrow. I hope I get this job. Wish me luck!

      My hair has looked good all day today! I styled it curly this morning before work, which means I'm now knackered as I was up an hour before schedule, but it's looked lovely and natural and tidy. I hate it when curly hair is brittle with hairspray. Ok day at work today, although quite exhausting and the less said about my bottom set year 7's the better. Just been exhausted and back-achy. So much I wanted to record on here but, when it comes to it, I'm just too tired to post too long a message. This reminds me why I am quitting my job. Had a really rough night last night. I developed a migraine at about 6pm and painkillers weren't touching it. It got progressively worse and made my brain go a bit funny. I started seeing things and hearing things and went on a bit of a looper, convinced something was trying to get at me. Seem to recall trying to attack my bed at one point, but the damn thing had it coming. I remember crying for at least an hour and the flowers that Si bought me made me cry even harder as I thought they were moving across the sideboard and it frightened me. I have decided to put this episode down to exhaustion and migraine, and not the mental disorder which it probably is :)

      Well, I bit the bullet and got my hair cut. I must say that I love it very much: it's a fashionable style and it looks great when it's straightened. However, as I discovered this morning before work, it's a pig to straighten. Luckily I still managed to get it looking good and I had many many compliments at work today. Which was nice. I saw the osteopath this afternoon: I have to go back on Friday. He says my ligaments are very inflamed, which is effectively making my spine stick together. Luckily, it's unlikely to be a long-term condition and it can be treated. He's surprised I put up with it for so long. So am I. Unfortunately, I had to have a pin stuck in my bottom for him to come to this conclusion. Have some school work to do and some emails to write, so will sign off now. G'night.

      Hurrah, it's that weekend feeling, coupled with that bad-back feeling which has made me lie on my desk at work today, mush to the amusement of my classes. My back was much better this morning, but now it's aching with the pressure of a long day behind it. Today, having said that, was quite good. Again, it wasn't what you'd call challenging (I'm beginning to like Fridays a lot more now that year 11 are no longer with us). My year 9's were ace this afternoon: apparantly the supply teacher they had while i was off sick was an absolute bastard. He made them work!! Shock horror!!! But he shouted at them quite a lot, made several cry, refused to let them use dictionaries and told a dyslexic student to 'have a guess' at a word she wanted help with. Suffice to say, they realised how lucky they were to have me as their teacher and they were very good, worked well and made me promise not to be ill again until the end of term. A promise I'm very happy to try and keep as I hate taking time off work when I feel I shouldn't. Well, I'm going to attempt to clean the flat now as mum and Alex are popping in tomorrow, before we go back to their house for the weekend (dammit, now I've spoiled the illusion: my flat isn't always tidy!!!) I'm having a bridesmaid dress fitting tommorrow (and I'm paying off a huge hunk of my wedding dress too) and I'm having my hair cut in the mrning. I'm in two minds about this. Part of me wants an image change. Plus, my hair needs to be shorter so that I can style it nicely for Anna's wedding, and I have lots of split ends, and it's so difficult to manage and I want it to look stylish for my job interview, and it rarely looks good these days. It tangles easily and I have no time to spend on it. But I like having long hair. It suits me. But then, my hair hasn't looked great for ages. But I want it long for my wedding. But my long hair looks fab in those photos i had taken last year. God, how vacuous am I?

      Well, I have some more excellent news! I have another job interview: this time with a company I really want to work for. Naturally, this has made me very happy. Even better is that the office is across the road from the British museum: heaven! Culture AND good shopping (plus the £22'000 a year doesn't hurt.) My interview is Thursday 24th, so wish me lotsa luck! My back is killing me, but it is painkiller time so I should have known better really. Can't wait 'til the osteopath's appointment. Today I have Period pains. Just thought I'd share that!

      Somehow I did manage to get some work done yesterday, but it wasn't easy. It's so nice to have that first day back after the weekend under my belt: I feel like I can relax now. Horrible incident at work today as we were driving out for a cigarette. A group of year 11 boys shouted at Flo "french c*nt." Obviously this was due to the football yesterday, but it sickened me. Flo tried to brush it off, but I couldn't. These kids are monstrous and they shouldn't be allowed to get away with it. I reported the incident to Ian, SMT...he was as disgusted as I was. I still feel angry for her. She's my friend and racism is sick and wrong. Other than that, things were ok. I am so looking forward to not being a teacher, particularly to my bottom set year 10's and 7's.  I had one of my agencies contact me today with details of a job. I said go for it. Fingers crossed (good pay!).

      The internet offers access to a bizarre world. Take www.subservientchicken.com ; a bloke dressed up in a chicken costume doing whatever you ask him to do. Also there's a site called www.biddycam.com Both are excedingly bizarre. I love the internet. My favourite site at the moment is www.whowouldbuythat.com  which is just a collection of mad stuff found on ebay and other auction sites. Putting them here so that I remember them really. Today has been a really easy day at work. Year tens, then 20 minutes exam envigilation, then 1 hour free, then year 7s then...well, then that was it for the day. Pretty unusual though. Did have a mad panic when I came home though: a job application for a national trust job had finally arrived but the closing date was today! Phoned them up straight away and after being put on hold for 30 mins I got through to a very understanding lady who emailed me the job application form, and I completed it on-line. I hope I'm not prejudiced against because of a crappy postal system!

      I don't wanna do any housework, I don't wanna do any marking!!! You see, this is why I generally dislike the summer. I'm not really an out-door person and being hot makes me very reluctant to do anything except watch DVDs and eat chocolate. The countdown towards the end of my teaching career has started, and I am feeling sort of wistful (it'll pass haha). My interview date is now on 8th July (which is a bit of a bugger as it means I won't be able to teach my a-level class, but as their exam is over now it will probably be ok). Just had Cilip ring me for an interview (it's a job agency) and the woman seemed really positive. I've also just found another job I want to apply for, so I'll do that now, before it's too late (and my painkillers kick in!) Love to everyone xxxx

      Another hot sticky day. I seem to spend my whole life in the shower these days. Still, at least the skies are nice and blue. Work was all right today. Nice and contented. What really makes me happy though is that my Doctor has finally referred me to an osteopath to get my back treated, free on the NHS. Oh, and my lovely rotary watch has broken, so I must get that fixed. Quite annoyed about that actually.

      Ugh, it is soo late (for me, anyway...my hellraising days are FAR behind me) but Si is asleep (finally: he stayed up last night playing on his PS2 and I'm surprised he's stayed conscious all day.) Me...well, I just don't have the tenacity any more, I need my sleep and warm milk. But I did want to post, to all who may be reading, that I found out an hour or so ago that I have a job interview!!! and as this blog is supposed to be following my lifestyle change, I thought I'd better mention it. Hopefully I'll remember to elaborate on it further when I wake up.

      I think that I need to take a break from replying to Job adverts. This is one I just emailed (in my defense, the wording of the advert was humourous and I decided to use the same approach)  Dear Sir, I am writing with regards to a position advertised within the Guardian Jobs Paper: Insight co-ordinator/Trainee Planner, working in your London office.  I am a highly imaginative person with a strange desire to work very very hard in order to justify my existence. I would consider myself to be fairly level-headed but with a good sense of humour: an asset when perhaps a day's work borders on the stressful side of things.  For the last two years I have been working as an English teacher in a Plymouth Secondary school. I am now seeking to move away from that particular career path as I would rather be involved with using my own skills as opposed to passing on skills to others. However, having been an English teacher I have developed many skills which would be well suited for this position.  I am highly adept at presenting information in an eye-catching way (if I am allowed to use PowerPoint then so much the better), I am easily able to adapt my manner and speech to different audiences, I have no inhibitions about speaking in front of crowds (be they well behaved or otherwise) and as I am able to control classes of up to thirty-five rowdy teenagers then it stands to reason that I must have a certain amount of charm.  My written and communication skills are of the highest standard. In my spare time I like to write children's books, which require a high degree of research, planning and preparation. Every facet of my being is centred towards the ability to plan, research and write well. As such, I believe that not only would this position be a fulfilling one, but that I might also prove to be an asset to your company.  My ability to research and find out obscure facts and details, whilst remaining highly organised, has lead my colleagues to term me as being quite anal at times. But it does also make me successful at pub quizzes; my capacity for trivia is unrivalled and my memory is equally impressive.  I am by no means against hard work. Whilst I would be at loathe to compare myself to a donkey, I believe that my persistent and hard working nature, and the ability to keep my mind fully occupied, would make sure that any initial 'donkeywork' is met with no resistance.  At university I studied, as my minor subject, Media Arts. I focussed particularly on advertising. As a result of this, I have a good understanding of the advertising world and I am frequently chastised by my friends and family for picking apart every advert that I see.  I hope that you will consider me for this position.

      And it's another nice and sunny day. I am getting a tan, which is always a novel experience for me. Sadly, the countdown to going back to work has begun: just four more days of freedom. However, as this is to be my last half term as a teacher, I am not going to let the job piss me off any more. Yesterday I applied for 3 jobs and today I have another 2 to apply for. It would be nice to be called to interview this time! One of the jobs I'm applying for I'm really hopeful about. One thing has cropped up into my mind, which concerns me. My back. Over the last few days my back has been killing me. It feels like the bottom few vertebrae have completely fused together (which, according to my doctor, they probably have) and I can't bend over without intense agony. Spent most of yesterday curled up on the sofa. This does worry me: as a librarian I will be required to do some book lifting from time to time. Not sure what to do about that. Having a bit of a moral dilemma: own up about my back problem and I'm reducing my chances of getting a job. Don't own up and I could end up doing more damage. Really bad period pains (sorry dad, skip to the next paragraph if you're reading this). Yesterday they were so intense that I collapsed on the way home from town: my legs just gave way under me. Plus I have toothache, which is very unfair considering I have now virtually eliminated sugar from my diet. Yesterday I made a t-shirt. It has a cartoon picture of Stitch (my rat) on the front with the words: Snitch for President. Snitch is her pseudonym in my book, which is going quite well at the moment. I have nearly finished the 5th story: halfway there. I have plans to write a sequel: where Snitch attempts to take over the world. It's the sort of thing that she would do. Right, let's get these other blooming job applications sorted. Then I'm going to clean the house and do some marking (sob sob sob).

      Well, as many know now, I didn't get the job. This is getting me down a little. I feel, to be frank, a big useless lump. I need job security. It's difficult to remember right now how exhausted teaching made me feel.  The house is a tip, the animals smell...I think I'm turning into poor white trash. All I need to do now is bring in the patio furniture and I'm set.

      Chihuahua! For some insane reason this stupid song from the Ministry of Mayhem is trapped in my head. Me and Si keep texting it to each other...because right now, I really need to jazz up my phone bill! Jees my feet smell bad. If only I could take them off and put them through the washing machine. First (proper) day of the holidays.&nbsp; I've been to the dentist to get my two fillings replaced (which didn't hurt at all, although now my mouth feels very crowded. I've been living with two gigantic cavities for too long) and now I'm sitting glaring at my mobile, willing Jayne to ring and tell me if I got that job or not. I'm so nervous. I really want this job and the longer I go without hearing anything the more I feel that the news is not good. Knowing my luck Jayne's off sick today. I'm finding it very difficult to motivate myself to do anything until I know. It's kinda like savouring that last moment of relaxation: if I get the job I'm going to have to immediately start a wild flat hunt and if I don't I'm going to have to resume my wild job hunt. Ring, dammit, RING!!!!!! Oh and Haru, if you're reading this, I've lost your email address: please email me :)

      That's it then. Over. Done. I am 'Miss H' no more. No longer a teacher. Hmmm. It's been an emotional drain of a day. Right now I'm torn between relaxing and getting very drunk. I think relaxing will win. I abandoned my untidy desk completely because I just had to get home AND RELAX: it's been a long week. Only 6 of my tutor group managed to make it in today, which is laughable. I was given another sweet little pot-plant as a present from one of my pupils; then we watched the final assembly which, although very long, was great. So much creativity. I cried at the end when my leaving announcement was made and I was absolutely thrilled by the cheering I received (which, rather than them cheering that you're leaving, is the way the school show how much they love you).&nbsp; There was screaming and stamping on the floors, which made my heart swell.&nbsp; Then I cried some more when students came to hug me goodbye and cried again during my final briefing. Carol said some truly wonderful things about me.&nbsp; I think it's only when you leave somewhere you can reflect on it and realise how much it's meant to you.&nbsp; I made a speech which got a few good laughs and was given a lovely silver bracelet which I was thrilled with. It's a lovely memento.&nbsp; Then I cried some more, because despite all the hard times the school has given me, it's given me a whole host of wonderful memories and it really has felt at times like one large family. It was such a shame that Colin, Chris, Matt, Justine and dear Marcelle weren't there. I will miss everyone dearly. Now I feel very tired. It's such a lot of people to say goodbye to all in one go. I feel quite empty and almost meaningless. I hate the fact also that I'm technically unemployed. I don't quite know who I am at the moment. Maybe I should start calling myself a writer. Or maybe I should stop defining myself by a profession and just be me for a change: a 24 year old woman with her whole life ahead of her. And onwards to the London adventure.

      I've been at a local theme park today where I did absolutely sweet F.A. except sit in a cafe writing one of my books. It was sooo dull, although I did get to see some very cute animals (including an adorable litter of kittens) and I got my face painted. Tomorrow we're off to Birmingham, which means I have to get up at 5am, so you'll forgive me for making this posting short. I have another job interview on Thursday. I'm feeling very hopeful for this one but I am quite concerned that it might be a maternity contract. We shall have to see.&nbsp; Did email the person who's set this interview up, but she must have gone home.

      It feels like I have just had the longest sleep in the world (oooh, just noticed a load of new features have been added to my blog, must play with them later!) I woke up finally (after having many dreams that I was heavily pregnant) at 12.30pm: well over a 12 hour sleep and by god I feel refreshed. Very frustrated that I can't find 'Crank it up' as a ringtone download. Grrrrr. Yesterday was the most wonderful of lazy days where me and Si did absolutely nothing. Today will be pretty much the same except that I will reply to some emails and tidy the flat, which has gone back to its bombsite look again. Friday was my last proper day teaching (although this week I still have to go to work to do activities week). I received lots of wonderful pressies from my tutor group and a few other students and it feels like I have spent the entire day crying. They made me feel so special, bless them. I'll miss my tutor group so much.

      Oh good God, I only have one day of teaching left!! (tomorrow's sport's day and next week is activities week.) There is so much going on in my head at the moment that I feel like my brain is going to fuse. With that borne in mind, I'm sure Si will forgive me if I pinch a Krispy Kreme. At the moment I am looking up traditional folk tales on the net, for my next children's book (note to self; finish one of the others first). I've always loved fairy tales and I think I have a talent for reworking them, but that's been done so often. Now I have instead turned my attention to folk tales as they tend to be more neglected and I'm going to rewrite them in a very humourous, Tony-Robinsonesque style.  But it's been surprisingly difficult to get hold of traditional folk-tales on line. Bloody Hell, a whole paragraph that had nothing to do with teaching or job-hunting. I'd better right that wrong straight away! A quite frightening event happened today at work. We were all in the English office when we saw hundreds of kids running past: a sure sign that a fight had broken out (which it had). And I'm talking hundreds of kids. The way the office is positioned, we're between two doorways, and suddenly a huge banging could be heard. We literally jumped up and raced out, splitting naturally into two groups (to tackle the the doorways.) John, one of our staff, was being slammed against one door by the mob (the only real word to describe it!) and I had to hold back the mob from the other door along with the other teachers. It was like a scene from Hillsborough. They were bashing on the doors and screaming at us, and the maths teachers literally poured down from the top corridors.  We tried to lock the doors but they wouldn't let us. One teacher had to literally shove the kids back. We locked ourselves in and yet no senior management. If we could have got hold of Chris or Matt they would have been on it straight away. Afterwards we holed ourselves up in the English office and went into shock a bit. We were all shaking and admitted to each other that we had been really scared. The kids were like animals. Oooooh, I've just found a site which gives you free on-line access to hundreds and hundreds (if not thousands) of actually books which have been typed up!!! Excuse me while I have a fit of excitement.  Can't type any more, must search the site for free books!

      I'm not quite feeling myself today. I have a terible sore throat and earache and I'm torn between wanting to go to bed and staying on the computer all night. The latter will probably win as I have 2 job-application profiles to complete on-line and a story to type up, both needing to be done tonight, but I'm feeling a little ucky, and I wanna cuddle but Si's in London and won't get back home until 11.15pm. School was rubbish today: I had to do literacy with year 7's all day and, whilst I was glad that I didn't have to teach my grotty year 10s (and never will again!!!!!!!) I had to contend with year 7s: a year group who, by and large, are absolutely vile! We wrote poems and I really couldn't have cared less about the whole deal. Sigh. Must ring my osteopath.

      I am, as ever, exhausted. This time, my neck is really aching as I've been at the compuper for many hours doing schoolwork type stuff in preparation for my last week. I'm gonna be doing so much marking for my holidays! Went home last night for Anna's hen-night. It was so much fun, dressing up and going out with the girls. We went for a chinese and a drink, then everyone else went out clubbing except me, as my back was killing me! It's still killing me, but at least I can lie down in a minute. It's horrible being in pain when you're at home. I've just written up a help-sheet with regards to my tutor group, to give to the teacher who's taking over from me. It makes me feel so sad to go over all the names. Or at least it did. Now I'm tired and achey and I want to go to sleep, which means I'm very glad not to be working as a teacher soon.

      One more week to go, one more week to go!! Thank GOD because I am almost faint with exhaustion at the moment. Had an ok time in London yesterday. The job looks like it could be quite enjoyable, although I don't think the interview went spectacularly well. I'm sure I'll do better once I've broken up from work as I'm always so shattered come interview day. Went to Harrods for more Krispey Kremes (had to queue for 30 minutes!!!!) and went to the Natural History Museum to take a picture of Dorcas for Si...and was very scared by all the animals. Got back at about midnight feeling suddenly overwhelmed by all of this, and having spent at least an hour on the train fighting back tears. This morning Si and I overslept. This evening, we're planning our wedding!

      Computers give me such headaches!!!! And rage. Trying to do a very simple thing, but it's taking forever. Dammit. Well, I have two job application forms to print up, should do that now really.

      According to my pupils, my listening to Jazz Legends CD on a continuous loop is a sign of my vast pretenciousness (my words, not theirs...which perhaps compounds this fact a little...) Well, can't say that I disagree with them. I think it's been another pleasant looking day. I wore my new Monsoon top in bright Fuschia. The lessons were good, although my bottom set year sevens nearly made my brain bleed. However, my other lessons were a good success. 8 more teaching days to go.....

      I have had the most fantastic weekend, and I have been spoiled absolutely rotten! So I want to start off by saying a very big thank you to EVERYONE whop sent me birthday wishes and birthday presents. I am touched beyond words at the thoughtfulness of the gifts I have received and I must have cried for every pressie that I opened. And I still have Anna's and Phil's presents to look forward to! Thank you again. I, of course, will be thanking people individually (this isn't my lazy way of getting out of thank-you letters), but I want to say an especially big thankyou to my darling, sexy Si (akage no inmo hehehehe) for the wonderful day he gave me. He bought me such wonderful gifts. I have a brown and white panda toy (just like in my dream), a Shrek 2 sticker album (hours of fun), a brand, spanking new CD walkman (so so cool!), Jazz Legends CD and an art deco trinket box which is too beautiful for words. I am the luckiest girl in the world to have such wonderful, generous family, friends and boyfriend. I love you all. Si and I, yesterday, went to Lorenzos to have a meal (Coco Chicken...note to self, must get the recipe) and we went to see Shrek 2, which was hilarious. I can't recommend it highly enough. I spent all day on a very happy high, and that high is only just starting to fade now. Today, with my mum and dad's birthday money, I bought a top from Monsoon (in fuschia pink, all ruffles but is actually office-smart) and I upgraded my mobile phone to one that takes pictures. It's brilliant, but I don't have a clue how to work it yet. Now I must job hunt, then tidy up the flat. Then I might try to figure out how to work my phone.

      It has been such a lovely day today. Kids being sooo nice to me. I got a birthday card from Sarah A, who is a darling and it touched me, and also a bunch of flowers from two pupils who were late back from lunch and bought me them as an apology. Nicked, no doubt, but it made me smile a lot. I also got some gorgeous pressies from the English crew: this most elegant notepad (from Monsoon!!!!!!) and a really cool rat model (although, due to the spikes it has, I wasn't entirely sure what it was at first). So thoughtful. Plus a beautiful card made by Kathryn: she is so talented, they are absolute works of art and it has taken pride f place on my mantel. I'm going out for a drink with some of the crew tonight (although not the English dep.) and that means I will not see my baby for a few hours. So darling, duckling, I love you more with the passing of each day, and I long to hold you in my arms when I return. Miss you, love you, forever xxxxxx And get well soon Ally-pally.

      The shower has taken on a life of it's own again, veering wildly between fantastically hot and fucking freezing. Every now and then I hear a scream and have to run into the bathroom to see Si cowering away from the watersaying "can you just adjust the taps for me honey?" Oops, there he goes! Trip to the dentist was uneventful: my fillings are still under guarantee so when they get done in a few weeks I won't have to pay! Hurrah!

      Finally got some feedback on the job I went for 2 weeks ago.  I think it's quite positive. We liked G****'s CV - it was very clear, contained all the relevant details and her statement of intent was excellent and a very useful summary.  When it came to her skills section she might consider bullet pointing this so interviewers can see everything at a glance.  As for the interview, she came across well and answered all the questions clearly, we also liked her honesty when it came to her teaching background and the reasons why she left it.  Unfortunately, there was a stronger candidate for the post. So at least I'm not totally useless. Very lonely right now.  The morning and late afternoon is always a time when I miss human-interaction the most.  Yes, I have the rats to keep me company but I do miss my friends.  And I feel a bit headachey and dizzy.  Gonna go now - this PC stuff ain't gonna help my bad back. Oh, and thanks to Blogger for taking my comments on board.

      I'm trying to have the world's most productive day today.  I'm typing up one of my rat stories, doing a cross stitch picture, playing with le ratons, sterelising the bathroom and kitchen, doing 2 washloads, hoovering and dusting and general cleaning and answering about 15 emails from my ex-pupils. A tenner says I'll pass out by 3pm!

      On Friday night I had the fun task of trying to sort out the mess our wild shower had created. Yep, the water pressure caused it to veer wildly out of control, flooding the bathroom and soaking the ceiling of my neighbours who live below my flat.  Naturally, he was not best pleased...and neither when I when insurance figures started floating before my eyes.  Luckily it all ended well the next day when I went down to speak to him; he's going to fix the damage himself.  But what a pain that was! Going home for an evening tomorrow to have a few last-minute bridesmaid stuff done.

      Nightmare day on Friday. In the evening, before me and Si were about to go out, I had a shower. There was a surge of water pressure that scorched me, I leapt back, the shower span out of control and flooded the bathroom. It happened so quickly! I called Si and, as I did so, there was an urgent knocking on our front door. The water had gone through the floor and flooded downstair's ceiling and light fittings. Naturally our neighbour was very angry, although his wife was more understanding. He thought we'd done it on purpose. Naturally we offered to pay for the damage and he calmed down, but he still gave Si a hard time. I was devestated. Saturday morning I went down to speak to them and he'd calmed down a lot. He apologised to Si for being so angry, appreciated that it was nobody's fault and, as he's a builder, he's repairing the damage himself.  So thankfully no harm done. Last night me and Si managed to go out and we saw Spiderman 2. It was actually a great film; I really enjoyed it more than I was expecting to. We also had a lovely meal at our local restaurant, which was excellent as usual. I've decided to apply for some jobs at the local council.  It seems naive not to try and get a job as nothing in London is forthcoming as yet. Neither of us would be unhappy to stay in Plymouth for a little bit longer - it would give me a chance to rest and also we could save more money. So I'm going to apply tomorrow and hope for the best. It would certainly give me valuable admin experience.
