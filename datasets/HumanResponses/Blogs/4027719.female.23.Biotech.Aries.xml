      RE: urlLink unterseeboot130  's posting on 27 July 04:  crying is definitely healthy for us. I cry a lot, too much sometimes. My mom always tell me crying is only for people who are weak. She hates it when I cry. so I tried to control myself all through teenage years not to cry. but i think she is wrong, crying comes from a sensitive heart, sensitive to sin, sensitive to pain, sensitive to other's needs. I just had a good cry yesteraday, from my cry, I realized my selfishness and the pain I've caused for someone. My heart is still filled with guilt, regret and pain, but after the cry, after I said sorry for so many times, I know everything will be ok.

      Have you ever been to the beach alone late at night? It was quiet an experience for me. I was tired of crying at home last night and was in desparate need for some fresh air. I thought I'd go to the beach where we had one of our fellowship activity nights, but I got lost. didn't want to call for directions, 'cause I didn't feel like talking to anyone. So by the time I got to a beach on PCH, it was already after 10pm.  You have no idea how many people come to the beach at that hour. There was a long line of cars parked along side of the road. Couples were out by their cars drinking wine and whispering, peolple who came alone just sat in their cars quietly looking out to the ocean. Amazingly, nobody was down at the beach. Maybe it's too dark or something, which is perfect for me. I slowly walked down to the beach and found a rock to sit on.  Looking aimlessly at the ocean, I realized I don't really know why I am there.  What is it about the beach that attracts me and so many others to come this late at night? I guess I was looking for a place to forget, to get rid of the guilt, to find clearity, to sort things out, to find courage and strength from above. But I ended up sitting there having no thoughts in my head, just enjoying the tranquility of the night. Perhaps that's why some people come here, not to think, but to forget thinking. Somehow, the stillness of the night, the vastness of the ocean, the crushing sound of the wave, the mysterious yet clear sky, the reflection of the moon dancing lively on the water, the sparsely spread lights from nearby houses and cars all created a perfect harmony for us to calm our agitated soul, to make us unable to think. This is when your feelings can become one with the nature. All the thoughts, rationalities become so unimportant and minuscule compare to the greatness of God's creation.  It got a little too cold after a hour of mindlessness, so I migrated into my car. Put on some light music, it's another Yi(4)Jing(4) (ha, I really need to work on my English vocab). It was a very comfortable feeling, like watching a drive-in movie. A movie about light in the darkness, about sources of sound together creating heart warming serenity, about variations seen through stillness. Everthing just seems so perfect.  I didn't want to leave, but my eyes were starting to warn me around midnight:"I have to get up before 8am tomorrow". alright, alright, I'll give you a break, i've already tired you out today.

      We went to BJ's for lunch again today, twice in three days, this time is for our ladies' lunch. Don't you notice that ladies have more needs for social interaction than men? You don't see men gather together just to chitchat about nothing. We have a woman's affinity group at our company, but I've never heard of a man's affinity group. Just an observation.  My old officemate and I carpooled there. It's funny how we talked more today than we've talked in the six months we shared office together. I used to be so intimidated by her, I don't konw why. But after we moved to our own cube, I actually missed her and want to get to know her better. And she seems to be more friendly and open to talk to me now as well. It's really weird. I think it's the same with my parents and I. when we lived together, I couldn't stand to be around them. I literally escaped here to LA just to get away. But now, even though there are still disagreements and a lack of understanding, I find myself care and worry about them a lot. I am not good at expressing my feelings, but I think they can still feel my change. I don't know if it's just me, i have to be physically apart from some people to appreciate them. huh.... intersting...  oh, I also had an interesting conversation with one of the QAs. She does horse dressage, also called "horse ballet". She can make horse dance. She has already been trained for nine years to compete in the 2008 Olympics. I didn't even know there is a sport like that. She is so enthusiastic about it too. She has to fly her horse to Beijing, which cost about $7000. I really admire people like that, they'd pursue their passion at whatever cost. Not because of any worldly values, but simply because they enjoy it so much. My old Pastor's son is like that. He likes playing basketball so much that he would work for a little while to make enough money and he'll quit to go play basketball. And when he runs out of money, he finds another job and quit again. I know it sounds stupid, his mom worries about him a lot, but I think it's great that he knows what he wants to do and has the courage to do it even though it's against all conventional thinkings.  Anyway, we had dessert at the end. It's called "bazuka? bazuki?". It' s a huge thin cookie topped with ice cream. The combination of hot cookie and cold ice cream brings out an unique texture in the cookie. It's very good. The lunch lasted for about 2 hours and now there is another party going on. I guess I am not going to get any work done today.

      This is R's last week working here at Amgen.  We went to BJ's for his farewell lunch.&nbsp;I sat there watch him talking, a sudden sadness came over me as I realized that this could be the last time I get to see or talk to him. It's such a strange feeling. I didn't know I still&nbsp;care that much.&nbsp;   I know he is&nbsp;just a passanger on my life train, and this is his stop to get off. I see him now only as a&nbsp;friend&nbsp;I&nbsp;truely respect and admire, nothing more. I am glad I got to know him in the short time we worked together and appreciate all the help he offered. My feelings for him went through so many different stages in the last six months or so... but it's all good. It worked out for the best. prayer really helps if you are not sure, emotion is&nbsp;a tricky thing, really.  Maybe I shouldn't share too much on this, I just want to keep a memory of him and say:"Thank you for everything and best of luck to you". Like the AC Sandy said:"He will be successful whereever he goes", yes, I am sure he will. And he will surely be missed by everyone here.

      Sometimes, God makes&nbsp;us&nbsp;wait a long time to answer&nbsp;our questions/prayers. Not this time.&nbsp; You probably read my post about happiness. I was actually a little depressed after posting that, I guess I was confused. The more I think about that topic, the more I feel my life is a mess.&nbsp; I went to bed early last night, around 10pm. But couldn't sleep, so I picked up&nbsp;the book Livia had&nbsp;left outside of my door the night before. The book is called "The Purpose Driven Life".&nbsp; I know most of you had already read that book, and I heard a lot of good things about it. But I never had&nbsp;the chance to read it.   First chapter, first sentence:"  It's not about you  ". Wow, such strong words. Read on:" The purpose of your life is far greater than your own personal fulfillment, your peace of mind, or even your happiness...... The search for the purpose of life has puzzled people for thousands of years. That's because we typically begin at the wrong starting point - ourselves. We asked self-centered questions like What do I want to be? What should I do with my life? What are my goals, my ambitions, my dreams for my future?". &nbsp;   There it is, there&nbsp;lies the simple yet&nbsp;definitive answer for my problem. I realized how narrow and selfish my thoughts are. I've been thinking too much about ME. I've made my happiness the goal of my life. If I don't know what hapiness is, I have no goal, no purpose. A life without purpose leads to no motivation, no energy, no hope. No wonder I am confused and depressed. Our purpose can only be revealed when we turn to the creator Himself. He has his purpose in&nbsp;each of our&nbsp;lifes when he created us. Our purpose is not self-defined. We can't make up a purpose/goal (like I want to be a&nbsp;lead BA in five years) and thinking that if we reach that goal, we'll be happy. We can't really define happiness either. Happiness is not a goal, it's only an illusion.&nbsp; I feel happiness is like a lot of beautiful bubbles in the air,&nbsp;they are&nbsp;only beautiful beacuse of the reflection of&nbsp;light from outside and because it's hard to grab ahold of. Each bubble can be each one of&nbsp;our 'dreams'. But when&nbsp;we actully get close to it, it looses its beauty and we'll start to pursue another bubble.&nbsp;The bubble itself is empty, it cannot fulfill&nbsp;us.   It's not that I didn't know we should seek for God's will in us before. I often ask God to lead&nbsp;me to walk on the path He has designed for me. In my knowledge, in my conscious, I know only God's will is the best for me. But I think subconsciously, a big part of me is still very self-oriented. I want to be happy, I want the things I like, I want God to help me get what I want. THIS IS VERY WRONG. Another quote from the book:" Many people try to use God for their own self-actualization, but that is a reversal of nature and is doomed to failure.  You were made for God, not vice versa, and life is about letting God use you for his purpose, not your using him for your own purpose ."&nbsp;  We shouldn't pursue happiness, but we&nbsp;will find true happiness when we find God's purpose in us and when we do our best to fulfill that purpose with God's help.   I woke up at 7AM today. "yeah!"&nbsp;Nothing has changed in my life. But I did feel an excitement in expectation to find more and more God's purpose in me each day. I believe God puts me where I am at each moment for a reason. And He has His way to mold me to be used by Him. I need to learn to put my complete trust in Him and to be patient and flexible(like a soft clay). I'll try to stop thinking too hard trying to make sense of things myself, and I really need to learn to let go of things that don't belong to me.   Today is a beautiful day, a new day, a day filled with hope. Thank you God, thank you Livia.  haha, this was meant to be short, I really need to control myself. it's like I am writing essays.

      Have you ever paid attention to those Latino (usually) workers&nbsp;who mow the lawn, trim the bushes, and spray fertilizers on the side of the road? I&nbsp;see them almost everyday when I go on one of my walks on Hillcrest. &nbsp;Everytime I pass by, they would give me&nbsp;this bright,&nbsp;happy smile and say:"Hello".&nbsp; It's not one of those phony office&nbsp;smiles, I can feel the sincerity and purity in that smile.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, I wonder why they are so happy. They have to work under the cruelty of the sun most of the day and receive minimum pay. But as I watch them help each other, play, joke around with each other,&nbsp;I can't help but feel a sense of envy towards them. It's hard to explain, I don't know why.   When I got back to my cube today, the BA/PM of the project I am working on walked in to&nbsp;chat. Once again, she complained about how unhappy she is at work and how unbearable those dirty office politics are.&nbsp;That's what she talks about everytime I see her. It's so sad.&nbsp;You work so hard to get&nbsp;an advanced degree in order to spend more than 1/3 of your day feeling unhappy and conflicted.&nbsp; I am sure she is not the only one around the office feeling that way. They are not happy, but they all continue to do the job, for what? money? prestige? or perhaps they just don't know what else can make them happier.   What about me? Am I happy? I asked myself that. Do I wake up excited every morning to face my day? No..... but why? I have a very nice working enviornment, flexible hours, a understanding boss, very&nbsp;kind, almost protective&nbsp;coworkers who treat me like their daughter/grand-daughter. I have nothing to complain about my job. But it's lacking something. Again, I don't know what.   I remember one summer in high school when I worked as a waitress, I had this excitement everyday before I go to work. I loved the longing glance of the customers at the kitchen door waiting for me to bring their food; I loved the "I can't wait to try this new dish" expression when I put the food down on the table; I loved the satisfying smile people have after they finish eating; I loved to say:"Is everything alright, anything else I can do for you?"; And I loved the "Thank you, the dinner was wonderful" as they walked out of the door; And of course, I loved to see how much tip they left, not only for the money, but&nbsp;as an indication of how my service was. Maybe&nbsp;this is&nbsp;very self-absorbed, but I felt I made people happy with that job, so I&nbsp;was happy.&nbsp;Everyday&nbsp;can start with this desire to make more people happy. Of course, there are difficult customers, and the bike ride home late at night was quiet scary, but it doesn't compare to the joy I get from everything else.   I keep thinking about something priskalivia wrote on her blog. something like "it's not about&nbsp;doing what you like, but like what you are doing". I liked that phrase a lot and I tried to practice to like what I do now. But more and more, I find liking something is a feeling. It's not logical, you can't force yourself to like doing something you really don't have the desire to do. ok, it's like that with people too, right?&nbsp;Don't you find that you like&nbsp;one person over another for no apparent reason, sometimes even against all reasons? You feel distant and disconnected to some other people, again, for no logical explainations. well, at least that's how I am. Is it a conscious choice? No..... i don't think so.   ok, ok, I think I am going too far. I am coming back to&nbsp;try to find out what make a person happy. Yesteraday in&nbsp;the sermon, Pastor Micheal said "Happiess is to follow Christ". I think this is the ultimate&nbsp;answer for us Christians. But&nbsp;this phrase is too high level and abstract for my little brain to comprehend. what does it mean and how? Maybe what I have now is the best for me ( I know this job is from God), I just need to change my attitude? Maybe He is trying to teach me things at this job, and I am just too absorbed in my own world to see it. uh(sign), I don't know. from time to time, i just want to change my career completely, but.... oh, never mind. I am too tired to think now, and very hungry. i can keep rambling on forever with no conclusion. But hey, this is the place to do it, to dump thoughts out, who cares if it makes sense or not.   If you are still awake trying to read this, I applaud you. And thanks for your patience. Now you know what I meant when I say I don't know when to stop thinking and writing.&nbsp; Alright, I am going home now.

      I was sitting at church going through&nbsp;things in my bag&nbsp;in attempt&nbsp;to find tissues, instead, I&nbsp;found my old watch sitting alone in a dark corner. It suddenly struck me, I haven't worn that watch for so long.&nbsp; I remember&nbsp;not long ago in college&nbsp;when I&nbsp;simply cannot live without&nbsp;that watch, every minute was so precious to me. I had to plan&nbsp;each day well to fully utilize the 24 hr given to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to know exactly how much time I have for what I am doing and when to start the next activity. I was always very punctual, and always in a hurry.   But look at my life now. I don't need a watch. Everyday is the same routine: wake up, go to work, lunch, get off work. The question of what time it is&nbsp;becomes quiet irrelevent in my daily life. What happened? What's so different from school and work? I don't like this lazy, unenergetic self. It's really tiring to be lazy, you know what I mean? I feel I don't have motivations to do anything, I don't really care any more for the things I used to love.&nbsp;I know there are so much I can do, like reading the bible, drawing, get more connected with family and friends...&nbsp;These are all the things I wished I had more time for in college, but now that I have the time, I am not taking the&nbsp;&nbsp;advantage of it.   I think God must be pretty mad at me now. Everynight before I go to bed, I tell Him I'd wake up early the next morning to spend more quiet time with Him in prayer and reading His words. But every morning, I wake up telling my alarm clock, five more minutes, ten more minutes until the last minute...... hummmm... I wasn't like that, my dad told me when I was little, I used to wake up one hour earlier than I needed to just sitting in my bed waiting for him to call me up.   well, each day is another new day. I pray tomorrow is a new beginning for me to start early with full energy and a grateful heart. I am wearing my watch again now. I don't expect it to change me right away, but hopefully it'll act as a constant reminder that I need to change the way I am now.... to use my time more wisely in accordance with God's will in me.  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      I can't believe I am finally starting my own blog. I have been resisting this blogging idea in fear of exposing too much of this inner self, not only to the public, but also to myself. There are things&nbsp;in me that even I am afraid to find out. So as you try to walk in the maze of my mind, please use extreme caution,&nbsp;put on&nbsp;protective gears, and most importantly, know when to stop reading. 'cause I have this incurable disease of not knowing when to stop talking, when to stop thinking, when to stop feeling, when to stop writing.....   This is going to be quiet an adventure for me.&nbsp;An adventure for me to&nbsp;discover who I am. I just found out recently that writing is an incredible tool to&nbsp;dig out the deeper side of oneself.&nbsp;&nbsp;That's probably why I decided to&nbsp;embark upon this self-discovering journey.&nbsp; It's not meant for the pleasure of the readers, only a plain, simple and truthful GAOBAI (sorry, i don't know the English word for this).

      I just had One-On-One with my manager. He came to my cube this time to check out my code. I showed him what I did with the RNALabel page and started to tell him about my confusion and how I think it's quiet impossible to accomplish what was proprosed. His immediate reaction was:"Nothing is impossible. Our job is to make what's impossible possible." He then asked me patiently what the problem was and started to help me seek a better solution.   I guess I was too into my own way of thinking, I thought going through each probe is the only reasonable way to check and update everything. But everytime I need to check for counter probe in a hyb, my algorithm becomes extremely complicated. He suggested to go through each Hyb and find pairs of probes. "Ding! Ding!" Why didn't I thikn of that? "I don't know if it'll work. You might run into another dead end. And this will make things more complex. It means you need to build very sophisticated data structures. and the checking process might need a major refactoring. But don't try to change the requirements. Conquer them instead!" He said.  His "Conquer them" keeps ringing in my head.  "Programming is all about creativity. " A friend once said to me. "No, it's all about logic." I rebutted back. But after a while, I know he is right. Logic only gets me to run into a brick wall(When I think too deep in one direction). It's creativity that turns me around and try to find another way out. It might not work, but that's the fun of programming. To be creative, to conquer a challenge. I haven't felt this excited to program in a long time.   Looks like a busy day for me. Back to work......

      Such a teary night.... I watched 'The Miracle Box' and 'Tuesdays with Morrie'. Both movies are about love and death that brings out life. I definitely recommend you watch these two movies if you get a chance. Especially 'Tuesdays with Morrie', I have to watch it again. After that, 'Good Will Hunting' has to go down one spot.   Try to jot down some notes so I don't forget.... -Life is not about longevity, what truly matters is the impact we have on others for each day that's given to us. "We must love each other or die" What does it mean? What if we never learn that lesson?  -Some people never stop their busi-ness and ask:"Why am I doing this?"  -"Love is the only rational act"  -What are your fears? fear of death? fear of crying? fear of silence? fear of being afraid? fear of being number two? fear of commitment? fear of being touched? fear of receiving love? fear of losing those we love whole-heartedly so we shy away from love altogether? fear of being touchy-feely?...We are constantly trying to run away instead of facing our fears. Only after Mitch realizes his own fears, he is able to battle and defeat them.  -Even the strongest person, the one you think has everything all figured out, has fear. He has his weak moments, he too needs a hug, a shoulder to cry on, a caring look, a encouraging smile....  -Don't take anyone for granted. We never know when we are going to lose them because of our selfishness and fear.  -"If you can have 24 hours of health, what would you do?" Mitch asked. Morrie's answer is so simple: eat good meals, be with loved ones, enjoy nature, do what you feel passionate about (in his case, dancing). "That's it? it's so easy" I believe was Mitch's reaction. Yes, happiness is very easy to find if we treasure everything we have. What would I do if I only had 24 hours? Would I still be a greedy sleeper? Would I feel resentful for something someone did long time ago? Would I watch meaningless TV all day? Would I be hesitant to make that phone call because of stupid "what if's"? Would I..... How about live each day like it's my last day.   -Morrie's comment on dependency:"I depend on others for everything.... culture says I should be ashamed of that..... When we are infants, we need others to survive. When we die, we need others to survive. But here is the secret, in between, we need others even more." No shame in needing and depending on others.....   There are a lot more great lessons that touched me deeply. But lessons are dead, I think what I'll remeber the most is Morrie as a person. So full of life, even near death, so real and so true, so discerning that he sees right through a person, so soft that you can't help but love him.   Special thanks to U-130 for lending us thoes great selections.

      Seeing one of my development areas is to gain more domain knowledge from my review, my manager pulled out a book from his bookshelf - "The Cartoon guide to Genetics" and said:"This is your assignment for the day". It's such a fun and informative book. Now I think all introductory science book should be written in cartoon format intermixed with idiotic jokes.   There is also "The Cartoon guide to the Computer" by the same author. see if I can find it, should be interesting too....

      As I was driving back from work today, an alarm went off in my head. It's not one of those small alarm clock type which you can snooze it off, it's the fire-truck going 70 mi/hour to put out fire somewhere type. I was thinking about something that has bothered me for the whole last week. I just suddenly realized I was so frustrated with the problem because I didn't respect a friend's feeling, her choice of living.  Just because she confide her emotion and confusion to me, I thought I need to help her to sort things out. The more I think about it, the more I feel her life is such a mess, the more I want her to live the way I thought would be the best. so? so... I am turning into my parents! you see? I screamed in my head. That is exactly how my parents make me feel, only their way is the best for me, there is no respect as to how I want to live my life. And now I know, only if you really care about that person, you would bother to try everything you can to make that person 'happy'. But who am I to know what makes another person happy? The only way to really care for and love a person is to try to understand that person. Even though I've known her for so many years, I don't think I've really made an effort to get to know her. I've always self-righteously thought I was a good friend, I did everything I could to help her whenever she needed. But is it out of love? Or is it just to make myself feel good? I started to question my motives for a lot of the things I did.   I called another friend (call her B)yesteraday to ask her advice to help that friend(call her A). I found myself complaining more about how I don't approve A's life style than really trying to help A. B just said, "sometimes, all we can do is listen and pray for the person. God has his way, his timing in each of our lives. We don't know what God's plan is for A. Just be a friend and let her know that you are always there when she needs you. Sometimes, doing nothing is the best thing to do." I was so busy yesteraday, I didn't have time to digest what she said. But now, everything starts to link together. I feel pressured and burdened by my parents' love because I feel they don't understand me. But isn't that how people around me would feel if I try to 'love' them my own way? What I think would make them happy might actually bring them pressure and make them feel uncomfortable. I think I did a lot of that recently. sorry... I didn't respect others enough, even though my intentions are generally good. ok, next time when I try to do somehting 'nice' for someone, I'll try to think about what the person's real needs are rather than what my own plans are. I am very sorry.... for those of you....... I know how aweful it feels, crushed by too much 'care'. I don't want to turn into my parents, at least with that respect, but I think I now know how they feel. It's only because they care too much.... yea, I should really communicate with them more often, who knows, maybe one day, when God's timing comes, we'll learn to love each other the 'right' way.......

      oh, man, I feel I am back in school again. My record in college is three days without any sleep and only crackers to fill my stomach. That was the horrible compiler class project.... I remember everyone came to school the next week with red eyes. yeeee.... I had dinner with two college friends last week, I feel college is so long ago now, we couldn't even remember our professors' names. I am getting old, my eyes can't stay open, and it's not even midnight yet. maybe I should just go home and start fresh tomorrow. I think I am sleep talking now.....who is making all those noise down the hall. somebody else is here too? ok, at least i have company.....

      "Hi, Y, I have a question on saving labeled RNAs." I walked into the project manager's office thinking that was the last bug I need to fix before Thur's presentation. "oh, thank god you haven't left yet, you are just the person I am looking for." She lifted up her head as she was sorting out a mountain of paper in front of her, "I just got off the phone with the clients in Seattle, they finally reached a concensus as to how they want the RNA labeling page to behave." She then proceeded to explain what changes I need to make. "oh, man, that's a lot of changes in the backend. The logic is completely different from how I implemented it." As I was listening, complaints started to flood my head,"you are the project manager, you are supposed to give me the final requirements before I start coding. It's not my fault that you didn't do your job. I'll never finish if you keep changing the requirements. you lay this on me the last minute, it's not fair".  I think my face must looked very stressed at that moment, she paused a little and said:"Do what you can, if you can't finish, it's ok. We can schedule another demo". "no, I can do it." I said unwillingly.   She looked at me like a mother looking at her child with an unbearable task to complete and started to tell me that she found out earlier today one of the scientists(Sumedha) we worked with was diagnosed with Leukemia. I was so shocked by the news "What? When? How? Why?". I just saw him a couple of weeks ago when I was taking a walk, he drove by and asked if I needed a ride. I'll never forget that friendly and energetic smile. He gave me so much encouragement when I first started working on his project. Even when I screw up, he was always very understanding. He is very humble and easygoing despite of his high position in the company. We all loved him. I froze there in the office, didn't know how to react to that fact."You know, H(one of our coworkers)'s wife also died from Leukemia two years ago.... Life is unpredictable." She said, "you don't know what's gonna happen tomorrow. but how you want to live today is your choice."   She also told me a story about a guy from her church. He fell down the stairs and injured his brain nerves. The doctor announced he'll be a vegetable the rest of his life. However, God miraculously healed him and now, he is living everyday for the Lord. Everything he has, he attribues to God, especially his health. I can imagine how the change took place in his life. Sometimes, God will use extreme measures to turn our hearts back to Him. "What would it take for you to live your life for me?" This question appeared in my mind after I walked out of her office. "I don't know, God. You know me better than myself, you know I have the heart, but I don't know how. Teach me at whatever cost." This is my lame yet truthful answer.   I am sitting in my cube trying to work now. I feel so silly that I got upset over such a small thing earlier. just because I have to work late for couple of nights? many people who are out of job would do anything to have the chance to work late. I should be thankful for my job, and for everything else I have. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but I can surely make today count while I still can. And I will pray for Sumedha, pray for healing, pray for courage, pray for wisdom, pray for his family as well. I hope to see you back, Sumedha!
