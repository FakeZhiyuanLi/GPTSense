      I was just wondering if any of y'all have advice on how to deal with bad attidudes with in a youth group.  To give some background to my question. I have a young lady (I hesitate on the lady part) in my group who seems to be nothing but a problem.  She is contantly mouthing off to myself and the other teens.  Her home situtation is not good.  Her Mother is a single parent who doesn't attend church and is a bit permisscuace.  I feel the need to reach out to this girl but can not figure out how. She has turned off most adults in the congregation with her attitude. I am almost to the point of asking her not to come back, in an attempt to not hinder the other kids. What do you think?

       urlLink Travis Stanley  had a link to see what theologian you were like. I thought it amusing. I was an Augustine. He was my favorite personality my Intro. to Christian Thought we studied at  urlLink LCU .         "God will not suffer man to have the knowledge of things to come; for if he had prescience  of his prosperity he would be careless; and understanding of his adversity he would be senseless."         You are Augustine!   You love to study tough issues and don't mind it if you lose sleep over them.  Everyone loves you and wants to talk to you and hear your views, you even get things like "nice debating  with you." Yep, you are super smart, even if you are still trying to figure it all out. You're also  very honest, something people admire, even when you do stupid things.        urlLink What theologian are you?   A creation of  urlLink Henderson

      Sunday in Bible class I asked my junior highers to define what the Gospel is. I put them in groups, and had them list what they thought the gospel is. They all knew it meant "good news." But, I was pushing for more depth (not always an easy task with junior high kids). Here are some the responses on their lists: 1. a type of music 2. good news 3. something that involves Jesus 4. something that involves us 5. The first four books of the New Testament  I had them turn to 1 Corinthians 15:1-8, and had them read there, and then asked them to tell me what the Gospel is? They were surprised at what they found out. That Jesus' death on the cross for the forgiveness of sins, burial, and resurrection three days later constitutes the gospel. I had them do this exercise because in church they hear the word "gospel" often, but often aren't told what "gospel" is and as we are embarking on our journey through the book of Galatians, the Apostle Paul uses this word often.   Knowing why the good-news is good-news is important, it's foundational to living as a Christian. I suggest we all spend some time reflecting on the gospel and what it means for us in everyday life. But, don't take my word on it. Read 1 Corinthians 15, and see if you come away with a clear picture of the Gospel.

      Doug and I were talking last Thursday about salvation, and through the work of Down in the River to Pray, and just examining our own experiences in church, and in our walks with Christ, and the Word of God, we discussed whether or not salvation is an event or a process.  I have to be honest, I first learned about salvation in the context of "event". Repent, and be baptized, and brother you are saved!  But, my question is baptism all there is to salvation? If it's not, then there are a lot of sincere brothers and sisters who have been duped into believing that baptism is it.   So, for the sake of our forum. Share you thoughts on baptism, salvation, and what it means to become a Christian. This should make for an interesting conversation.

      Just curious to see if ya'll are experiencing the same thing I am. Have you noticed an increase in youth group tension when new teens arrive, and are active right away? And if so, have you noticed an increase in tension if the new youth group member also begins to date around in the youth group?

      Have any of you read the book by Hicks and Taylor entitled, "Down to the River to Pray"?  I just finished it this past week.  I thought the book was incredible and reflects a hermeneutic that is really in touch with God's intentions in Scripture.  However, some of the thoughts presented in the book would be considered radically oppositional towards traditional church of Christ perspective on baptism.  Some might argue that Hicks' view of baptism is lower than it should be, but I feel, however, that the view presented of baptism in the book is one of the highest that I have seen.  Does anyone have any thoughts or input?  Even if you don't agree with everything, this book is a must read.  I can't say that I agree with all of it, but I loved the challenge it presents.

      I am not an expert on post-modernity, but I am acquanited with the topic a little, and it effects all those who minister to youth. My question, to hopefully engage us in conversation is, since one of the trends in our postmodern youth is to follow a set of beliefs that work, or something that's practical, how do we as the church effectively minister to teens to show them that being a follower of Jesus works?

      Make time for God. I know we all are busy, but make spending time with Christ a priority. Sometimes, I feel that us postmodern Christians have lost the art of solitude, fasting, meditation, etc.   What are some ways that you make spending time with Christ a priority?

      Just a question:  Do you have an increasingly difficult time getting away from church things and church people to spend time with your family, your spouse, significant other, or family? If so, let's talk about how we can minister effectively and then also be available for the other important relationships in our lives.  &nbsp;

      This year being my first full time in ministry has been full of twists, treats, and surprises. Tonight after church, I held a VBS meeting. Overall, it went well. Sometimes, in a meeting of any size with people with differing views, some toes just can't help but to be stepped on.   Toe stomping, anyone?!

      Late Modern or Postmodern Theology: Blessing and Curse for the Church Today An Essay by Jason M. Retherford  	I will begin this essay with the affirmation made by Dr. Patty in the course announcements for this week, that “postmodernism is very often horribly misunderstood.” I confess with reluctance that I  have often horribly misunderstood postmodernism. From conversations with peers, and reading outside of class, I understood postmodernism to primarily be relativistic. While, there may be relativism in certain segments of postmodern thought, I have been challenged to rethink the way I perceive postmodernism. One of the difficulties for me in coming to grips with the term postmodern is trying to define it’s essence. Doing so also required an attempt at understanding of modernism being over, and from my readings in McGrath, Introduction, trying to apply precise definitions to either of these terms is elusive.  So what is postmodernism? Postmodernism is understood to be the period of time that we are in. I am not sure how accurate I am at on this point, but it seems to me that postmodernism is a transitory phase in human history. I say transitory in that with the pace that Western society changes, I am not sure where we are headed. Postmodernism is an attempt to frame a worldview apart from long standing institutional definitions of such.  Postmodernism is a reaction to the straightforward linear approach of reason and experience characterized by the “modern” period.  Postmodernism and all that this term appeals too seems to be more global in nature. Global in the sense that it appeals to a wider world of reality than any one definitive worldview, so in this sense postmodernism takes on a relativistic nature.  To aid in the misunderstanding of postmodernism is societal religious pluralism and irreligious dogma in light of a post 9-11 world. To give various religious traditions a voice in the global situation has accelerated in our postmodern world. It’s not that religious dialogue among various faiths haven’t taken place, but with the situation Western society has been thrusted since 9-11, it seems that there is an appeal to explore the motivation of other religions, especially in matters of love, justice, and mercy. Where does Christianity fit into this ongoing debate? With the wholesale rejection of Christianity in certain segments of the Enlightenment and subsequent modern period, I think that now more than ever there is a need to distinguish the particularity of the Christian message.  Postmodernism rejects grand narratives or metanarratives, these were seen as authoritarian (McGrath, Introduction, 114). I find it fascinating that where the postmodern philosophers reject metanarratives, our society thrives on the language of story, and the theology of postliberalism incorporates such metanarratives. Is this the great paradox of postmodernity? A wholesale rejection of narrative by a society that in mass flocks to movies, is fascinated by fiction and history, engrossed in music and the arts? At this point, I am again inclined to say that at best postmodernism confuses me. Confused as I maybe, there is indeed a movement that may be understood to be reactionary within Christianity to identify itself in light of our postmodern plight. With the exploration of the Church’s future it becomes increasingly clear that that theology in the postmodern period will best be that which transforms the world instead of trying to explain the world (McGrath, Reader 1.28). As far as the Church is concerned, postmodernism is a blessing and a curse. Where postmodernisms has been a curse is that it is often misunderstood to be something entirely it is not. Church leaders, at least in my experience within the churches of Christ in the United States, have typically lead from a modern mode. Church leaders in the older generations that are often in leadership positions as elders have lead from the more linear approach that likes tidy, back and white ideals and with a firm foundation in the experience of tradition handed down from the previous several generations. This rationale in the Church has met conflict as two competing worldviews have collided. Postmodernism is perceived to be scary and disconcerting to the established order. I think what postmodernism offers Church today is a wholesale rejection of doing church just for the sake of doing church. Let me elaborate…with postmodernisms’ rejection of “yesterday” it is clear that our present situation or crisis, however it may be deemed, that a dialogue is needed to discern the direction of the Church. A dialogue that would serve to clarify the salient points of postmodernism, and attempt to pacify fear of the unknown in attempt to discover the common ground that exists between both competing philosophies and discard the rigidity of the established order where it has produced lifeless spirituality. Indeed, the 21st century is a Church in transition. I doubt that postmodernism will be solely responsible for helping the Church find it’s way in a new world, but I do think postmodernism can serve a higher good, and that higher good being finding that which is lovely, true and praiseworthy in our day and age.  The readings this week, weren’t vastly different from the readings of last week. However, on the whole, modern and postmodern conversation, especially in the arena of theology is vastly different than it’s previous predecessors. I say this because in the other periods that we examined at least up to the Enlightenment, in that theology was written and practiced in a generally Christian culture, whereas beginning with the Enlightenment there was a rapid increase in the secularization within society, I like the verdict of Bonhoeffer on this matter, “Man in challenged to participate in the sufferings of God at the hands of a godless world” (Radical Theology and the Death of God by Thomas Altizer and William Hamilton). This godless world is an ever-increasing reality, in which the task of theology is defining its central message. I think in defining this message, theology will help to transform a godless world, by becoming the hands, feet, and voice of Jesus Christ.

      Post-modernity? What is it? Trying to define it goes against the very essence of PM. The problem with most of us, and our churches, that we are stuck right smack dab in the middle of modernity.   "Doing" church in our post-modern era just doesn't cut it. Seekers are looking for authenticity, relationships, and spirituality. What are we giving them?

      I signed for up for classes the other day at Lubbock Christian. But, right now I am looking forward to taking a break this summer. Wait, a minute, I am in Youth Ministry, I don't get a break! LoL!   Thought of the week borrowed from LCU.edu: A proud man is seldom a grateful man, for he never thinks he gets as much as he deserves. A proud man is always looking down on things and people. And of course, as long as you're looking down, you can't see something that's above you. -C.S. Lewis    Blogging where no man has blogged before!   Ya'll, I need serious prayer!

      As Easter is approaching, I challenge us all to spend some time reflecting on the Passion of Jesus!   A word from the Word: Read Isaiah 53  "He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,  and as a sheep before her shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth." --Isaiah 53:7  Food for Thought: Just Another Friday…      Ponder Good Friday for a minute. Good, hmm, stark irony to a Friday long ago. An angry mob. Mock trials and mockery. Beatings after beatings. Bruises and blood stained skin. The blood-thirsty crowd wanted him dead, and now. But why, what crime did he commit?      Well none. His death sentence may be the greatest mockery of justice ever. Isaiah said that the Messiah would be numbered with the transgressors (Is. 53:12). Those that gripped the tightest the doctrine of God's law claimed that this man, this Galilean blasphemed God by claiming to be a king, by claming to be the Son of God. But not once during his whole life did his words contradict the words of the Father. Not once did he raise his hand to strike a brother. Not once did he covet what he did not have. No, the One who stood before Pilate is the One who has stood in the hallways of Heaven in the presence of the Father. The hands that were bound were the ones that touched the untouchables.. His words spoke of the promise of life, but now the words of his accusers were those that would lead to his death.       The verdict was pronounced, and now the Author of Life was marched to meet Death. The walk from Pilate's palace to hill of Golgotha would be a death march. A few days prior, throngs of people lined the streets of Jerusalem to welcome Jesus, to welcome the Messiah. They sang Hosannas, now they hurled hate-filled words at One from Heaven. Yet He marched on. He knew His mission, and He knew His Father was watching. Reaching Golgotha, the Roman soldiers executed their orders and they executed the carpenter from Nazareth. It was hear at the place of the skull (Golgotha), that the Bread of Life was broken. Innocent, the Lamb of God was slaughtered.  Oh the pain He endured! Oh, the wretched pain.   The pain of betrayal…          Hours earlier disciple's kiss lead to His arrest.              His friends, His closest companions fled into the night.                  The people who once praised Him, now cursed Him.  The pain of death…      Nails ripping through flesh.          Bruises from beatings.              Scars from scourging.                  A crown of thorns ripping through His forehead.                      The mind numbing agony of crucifixion,                          And the horror of grasping for each breath   He endured the pain of sin…      Every thoughtless word.          Every selfish deed.              Every hand raised in anger to strike another.                  Every sin from The Garden of Eden to Golgotha to you and me.   He endured the pain of separation.       For all eternity the Father and the Son had enjoyed constant unity.           With the sky blackening, the Father looked away.              Any wonder the cry from the cross…"My God, My God why have you forsaken me."                  Jesus died alone, soaked with our sins, and soaked with His own blood      What will you do with this Friday. A Friday that is unlike any other. Will you run and flee like His closest companions or will will stay near the cross like a few of his followers whose love for this man brought them near even in the face of death. Choose to spend time near the cross. Reflect on this man's life. His words, His love, His compassion. His death though tragic, leads us to follow Him still. Follow Him beyond Friday. You're in for a treat. Amen.

      You Have Saved The Best Till Now...      This phrase jumped out at me from John 2 and verse 10, "...but you have saved the best till now." The scene is a wedding in Cana in Galilee. The guest-list includes those residing in the town, along with Mary, the mother of Jesus, Jesus her son, the carpenter, and Jesus' ragtag buddies he met a few days prior. Sometime during the wedding celebration, a crisis occurs. There is no more wine! Poor planning on the wedding parties part is about to turn into a major  social embarrassment. What a way for a bride and groom to begin their new life together.      Mary's role in all of this in unclear, but she brings the problem to her son, and he responds. Jesus the carpenter becomes Jesus the bartender, he has the servants fill six large stone pots to the brim with water, and voila, poof, water has become the blood of the grape. This not just fermented drink. No, for we are talking vintage wine. The best of the best. The master of the banquet is impressed at the quality and timing of such a drink. For it was customary to serve the choice wine first and then once the taste buds were tingling, the host served the cheaper wine.      I think the point of this story is summed up in the last part of verse 10, "...but you have saved the best till now." Hasn't God done the same? All the great men and woman who have come before were like the choice wine being served first at the wedding. But God has saved the best till now. The person and work of Christ is heaven's best. God's love doesn't get any more real than what is revealed in the person, work and words of Jesus. Jesus is the best of what heaven has to offer. The inner thirsts of our souls are quenched when we drink from the fount of God. Will you drink at the fountain? Amen.     3/12/04 -- Friday  Jason M. Retherford

      The final exam to my Introduction to Christian Thought class was canceled, all our class work has to be in by May 5. I am done. I e-mail Dr. Patty my research paper last week. It's all good.   I just have to finish my last book review on the Hobgood book, and then write my semester project.   This weekend, I am teaching a class at a Bible Teacher's workshop here in Duncan about how to make your Bible classes spiritual and interesting. I am nervous. I have never taught a Bible class to adults other than preaching, and secondly, I have never taught a class about teaching to fellow teachers. This weekend should be rather interesting.

      Anyone with children knows that teething is a bad deal. My daughter has been going through this ordeal for some time. Her gums are swollen, and she is just uncomfortable. The worst part of all this, is not knowing how to make it better, well that was until last night. Several days have passed with a very irritable 9 month old, screaming relentlessly late at night. Last night, we found baby ora-gel. It numbed her gums, and she went to bed earlier than the night before. Poor thing. I know she hurts, and it hurts her mommy and daddy to know she hurts and we can't take her pain away. I would trade her spaces in a moment. Oh, howI wish I could take her pain, and discomfort on myself. Isn't that what Father's do for their children? I can think of One who did exactly that, and more. He put on garments of flesh, and lived among us. He bore our pain, our hurts, felt our deepest sadness, and took on our most yucky moments on the cross. He became a curse for us (Gal. 3:13) so that we might have life. God is good.

       Food for Thought:    This qoute comes from the book, Welcoming Resistance by William Chris Hobgood, page  45,"... the congregation without initiatives is mired in mediocrity, racking up reasons to be called irrelevant and heading into decline. Yet the impulse of all systems, congregations included, is tot maintain stasis, or balanced stability. In spite of the latter, we find that biological systems change-a fact as natural to them as the stability impulse. Smiliarly, social systems, like congregations, change just as much as they need to maintain stability. Neither biological nor social systems will stand still, however powerful that impulse may be ."

      With the stormy skies behind us, I can relax a bit. Duh, tornado alley, what'd you expect?   Anyway...I am preaching Sunday morning, and Sunday night. I have both lessons done with powerpoints. Today, is devoted to catching up with school work. I've got two weeks or so left in the semester, and I will be glad when the semester ends.   I've been reading some about the history of the "Restoration movement." Why is it that the men like Thomas, and Alexander Campbell, as well as Barton Stone and others seemed to be okay extedning the hand of fellowship to those in other religious tribes, but when we, or should say any one in the churches of Christ, tries to reach out to the larger Christian community they get shunned. What started as a restoration movement, restoring New Testament Christianity, somewhere in our history has shifted to a conservation movement.   When we become more interested in what "other" churches were doing instead of seeing the needs in our community.   When our leaders preached condemnation to anyone out side the "Lord's Church" instead of seeking and saving the lost.   When congregations stopped seeking the Living Crist, and the excitement and expectancy that accompanies worship. When we began to perform the five acts of worship as if we were they only ones who had these five acts just right.   No more questions were asked, no more opinions were allowed. If you don't believe like us, you must not be one of us.   When sincere members sharing their faith preached a Gospel that equals be baptized only. In other words, when we started converting people to the church and not Christ.   I know this list is not exhaustive, but I think it is illustrative of some of "our" hangups as a religious tribe. I have heard many sincere Christian people, week after week get hung up on the five steps of salvation. Brothers, and sisters there is more to our Christian walk than these things. It's like many of our people are stuck just drinking milk. I am not saying Baptism isn't important. It's illustrative of our Lord's death, burial and resurrection, it's where come into contact with the blood of Jesus and is ESSENTIAL, however, how many times can we have the same conversation. People in the world don't care about our neat little five acts of worship or five steps of salvation. Paul writes in Galatains, "...the only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love" (Galatians 5:6). The people outside our church walls need a Savior not a sermon. They want to see us living an authentic, genuine Christian life.   Please don't misunderstand, I dearly love the Churches of Christ. I just feel that we have lost a sense of restoration, and have chosen conservation.

       Close One...   This evening, I experienced my first real tornado warning, and threat. An actual tornado touched down just several miles west of Duncan. We had torrential rain, hail the size of quarters, thunder and lightening, high wind gusts. I am used to thunderstorms, however, tornado alley thunder storms are a whole new ball game. Was I scared? I'd be lying if I said "no." I was scared. One thing was constant, and un-moved by strong winds. My God. His love for us is fixed securely on the objects of his love. It's the cross that secures God's love.

      I mentioned the other day a little about the letter to the Galatians. I have enjoyed this week of study, and worry, and wonder. I think now, after spending all the time I have this week, Galatians is one of my favorite NT books.  The title of my sermon on Sunday is Galatians: Reaffirming the Gospel of Grace. Paul's whole purpose of writing this rather short Epistle is to remind the Galatian churches that they were saved because of the cross of Christ not because of circumcised flesh. In addition to preaching the first lesson in a new series on Galatians, our church, is also going to be studying the letter to the Galatian church in some detail. Our emphasis this year has been on grace. Galatians fits well with our emphasis.

      Tonight in my class with the teens we are going to explore the concept of grace and what it means in our lives.   Here is a foretaste of what were are discussing:  "Grace means no mistake in my life disqualifies me from receiving God's love or being God's instrument."

      Here is a story that was sent to me via e-mail:  WHEN THE WINDS BLOW ~  Years ago a farmer owned land along the Atlantic seacoast.  He constantly  advertised for hired hands.  Most people were reluctant to work on farms along the Atlantic. They dreaded the awful storms that raged across the Atlantic, wreaking havoc on the buildings and crops.  As the farmer interviewed applicants for the job, he received a steady stream of refusals.  Finally, a short, thin man, well past middle age, approached the farmer.  "Are you a good farmhand?" the farmer asked him.  "Well, I can sleep when the wind blows," answered the little man.  Although  puzzled by this answer, the farmer, desperate for help, hired  him.  The little man worked well around the farm, busy  from dawn to dusk, and the farmer felt satisfied with the man's work.  Then one night the wind howled loudly in from offshore. Jumping out of bed, the farmer grabbed a lantern and rushed next door to the hired hand's sleeping quarters. He shook the little man and  yelled, "Get up! A storm is coming! Tie things down before they blow away!"  The little man rolled over in bed and said firmly, "No sir. I told you,  I can sleep when the wind blows."  Enraged by the response, the farmer was tempted  to fire him on the spot. Instead, he hurried outside to prepare for the storm. To his amazement,  he  discovered that all of the haystacks had been covered with tarpaulins.  The cows were in the barn, the chickens were in the coops, and the doors were barred. The shutters were tightly secured.  Everything was tied down.  Nothing could blow away.   The farmer then understood what his hired hand meant, so he returned to his bed to also sleep while the wind  blew.  MORAL: When you're prepared, spiritually, mentally, and physically, you have nothing to fear. Can you sleep when the wind blows through your life? The hired hand in the story was able to sleep because he had secured the farm against the storm.  We can secure ourselves against the storms of life by grounding ourselves in the Word of God. We don't need to understand, we just need to hold His hand to have peace in the midst of the storms.  ...I hope you sleep well!   If you liked that story, you will like this one from Max Lucado:  HE SAID IT! ------------------  by Max Lucado   God’s efforts are strongest when our efforts are useless.   Go back to Bethesda for a moment. I want you to look at the brief but revealing dialogue between the paralytic and the Savior. Before Jesus heals him, he asks him a question: “Do you want to be well?”   “Sir, there is no one to help me get into the pool when the water starts moving. While I am coming to the water, someone else always gets in before me” (John 5:7).   Is the fellow complaining? Is he feeling sorry for himself? Or is he just stating the facts? Who knows. But before we think about it too much, look what happens next.   “‘Stand up. Pick up your mat and walk.’”   “And immediately the man was well; he picked up his mat and began to walk.”   I wish we would do that; I wish we would take Jesus at his word. I wish, like heaven, that we would learn that when he says something, it happens. What is this peculiar paralysis that confines us? What is this stubborn unwillingness to be healed? When Jesus tells us to stand, let’s stand.   When he says we’re forgiven, let’s unload the guilt.  When he says we’re valuable, let’s believe him.  When he says we’re eternal, let’s bury our fear.  When he says we’re provided for, let’s stop worrying.  When he says, “Stand up,” let’s do it.   I love the story of the private who ran after and caught the runaway horse of Napoleon. When he brought the animal back to the emperor, Napoleon thanked him by saying, “Thank you, Captain.”   With one word the private was promoted. When the emperor said it, the private believed it. He went to the quartermaster, selected a new uniform, and put it on. He went to the officers’ quarters and selected a bunk. He went to the officers’ mess and had a meal.   Because the emperor said it, he believed it. Would that we would do the same.   Is this your story? It can be. All the elements are the same. A gentle stranger has stepped into your hurting world and offered you a hand.   Now it’s up to you to take it.  _________________________  From He Still Moves Stones  Copyright 1999 Max Lucado

      This evening, Jennifer got a rare treat. We had a dinner with another young couple. It seems that being in Youth Ministry that having a life outside of church is very difficult. Jen has done a much better job at meeting new people, and hanging with those she has met. I on the other hand, am somewhat of a recluse. I do fine around the teens, but when adults enter the picture, I don't seem to do so well.   I was blown away today, I was invited to come speak at a local High School at the Fellowship of Christian Athletes meeting next Thursday. Wow! I don't get asked to be the guest speaker much anywhere.   I guess I am off for now. I am going to go hang with my wife.

      Update on Leonard:  I got an e-mail from our preacher today from Slovokia. He was at an internet cafe, and had access to e-mail. Him, and Liz are doing well. It was sure nice to hear from him.   The more we talk, and the longer I am here at  urlLink Chisholm Trail  the more I feel like one of the family!

      I am currently engorssed in a study of the book of Galatians. I am enjoying gleaning insight from far wiser, and far more godly men, than I.   Galatians has been referred to as a condensed version of Romans. Though smaller in number of pages, definitely not any lighter in it's theology or it's appeal to the cross of Christ as central to our justification, and reconciliation. Galatians is quite a hum dinger of a book. The Apostle Paul is combating legalism, and does a marveouls job at once again pointing the Galatian Christians back to the cross as the starting point, and ending point for our salvation.

      This morning at church, we had a guest speaker. Harry Riggs from  urlLink Sunset International Bible Institute  preached for us, and then during class talked about all the ministry endeavors sunset is engaged in. I didn't know Sunset was involved in so much.   This evening, our congregation hosted the area wide worship. Six congregations in our county got together for an evening of singing, worship and fellowship. Afterwards, we hosted an area wide teen devotional in our teen building. I don't like to dwell on negativity, but there was one sour moment to the evening. This was an area wide teen devotional, so one of all black churches came to fellowship with us. There were about six African-American teens that came to the devotional. Six black teens amongst 30 or so white teens. Not one of my teens, or any of the teens from the other churches intorduced themselves to our black brethern. I did walk over and talk with them a little, introducing myself, and trying to make them feel welcome. It broke my heart though as the evening went on, that not one of the white teens went over to the black teens, to even try and make them feel welcome. One thing is for certain, I have a lot of work to do teaching our teens about welcoming visitors. Why is it so hard for us to make strangers feel welcome? It's not just teens, and not just church settings. We have all been out and about and passed by a stranger, someone who didn't dress like we did, or come from the same part of town as we do. When we will cease in letting these things hinder us from being Christ's ambassadors? If I was one of the black teens walking into a room of 30 white teens, and no one came over to talk to me, I don't think I would want to go back.   "Lord, help us to look past the color of a person's skin, and see them as your children. Help us not to keep ourselves segregated in our social, and racial circles, but help us Lord to reach out beyond our comfort zones, and not to fear the unknown. Forgive us for the times we let opportunites go by to reach out our hand and welcome the stranger. I Jesus name, amen."  The school semester is coming to a close. I have enjoyed my studies this semester at  urlLink Lubbock Christian University . But with the end of the semester comes term papers, and finals, and in this case one final book review. Also, this week, I am preaching Sunday morning, and Sunday night, and teaching class Sunday morning. All in all, I guess you could say this week is a busy week. I can defintely use your prayers to get through this week, and the next two with God's gracious favor.

      "A righteous man may have many troubles, but the LORD delivers him from the all" --Psalm 34:13  I don't know about you, but us fellow strugglers need a verse like this to remind us that troubles though they come, aren't all that bad. Sure, no one is particulary found of hurting, but in those moments of utter helplessness we can be assured one thing..."The LORD is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit" (Psalm 34:18).

      Our VBS theme this year at church is going to be "Elijah." There have been many fine people this year already that have volunteered to help. I was just e-mailed our skit. One of our members, has a brother in law, who writes VBS skits. Anway, it works, I am downloading it as we speak.   This time of year, Spring, and with the summer approaching, Youth Ministry gets really busy. It seems like I can't find enough hours in the day to do all that could, and needs to be done.

      Just an update...  my grandma has to have more tests. The doctors have found more spots on her lungs. For any that come across this blog, please pray for grandma and my family. Mom, her brother, and sisters, need to know God is near in the tragedy, and fear that surrounds sickness and death.   I have been reading some other blogs out there is blog-land, and there are quite a few that I enjoy reading. Fellow bloggers, keep it up.  Tonight, I am hosting a boys' all nighter. By the time I get to bed Saturday morning, I will have consumed several pots of coffee, tons of mountain dew, eaten a lot of pizza, and played tons of x-box. Sounds like fun?!

      Soteriology, Christology, and Anthropology  	I will begin this essay with a brief definition of what each of the three terms means. Soteriology, is derivative of the Greek work for salvation. Soteriology in this paper will refer to the doctrine of salvation in Christ. Christology is the study of the person and work of Jesus Christ. Anthropology is the study of man, and in this case, the sinfulness of man. These three areas of theology have been hotly contested issues through the ages, in the theological development of the Church. There is the closest of connections between Soteriology and Christology. I see a close relationship also between Soteriology, Christology and the objects of this salvation, being found in anthropology. 	My understanding of salvation is grounded in my relationship with Jesus Christ, and my confession of Him as Lord. The Bible is clear in Acts the fourth chapter and verse twelve, that “Salvation is found in no one lese, for there is no other name under heaven given to men by which we must be saved.” That name, being of course Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is central to salvation. His mission is clearly stated in Luke the nineteenth chapter and verse ten, “For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost.” What was lost? Man’s relationship with God. Genesis chapter three, reveals how sin entered into the human narrative through the deception of Eve by the serpent at the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and her subsequent inclusion of her husband into this sin. God had instructed that man was to avoid these trees, they were not for food (cf. Genesis. 3). Needless to say, sin entered the picture. The perfection that existed between God and man was now marred by sin, and the situation intensifies as one continues to read the Genesis account. By the time you get to chapter six, and verse five and six you read these words, “The LORD saw how great man’s wickedness on the earth had become, and that every inclination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil all the time. The LORD was grieved that he had made man on earth, and his was filled with pain.” Sin separates man from communion with God. The Apostle Paul makes mention of the stain of sin, and it’s global nature in Romans the third chapter and verse twenty-three, “for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” Because of the sin problem of man, God took action. Encasing himself in human flesh and subjecting himself to mortality God entered the picture as a man, and yet retained His divinity. This notion of Jesus being both God and man, has too been the subject of much debate. The author of this paper takes the view that there is much about God that will remain mystery.  The cross is where God effectively deals with the sins of man. Salvation is effected by the blood that was shed by Christ Jesus. The Old Testament promises that God would deal with our sin problem. The author of the Hebrew epistle quotes from Jeremiah chapter thirty-three and verse thirty-four, “For I will forgive their wickedness and remember their sins no more” (Heb. 8:12). How God does this is through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross. “…without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness” (Heb. 9:22). God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself (cf. 2 Cor. 5:19). In addition to Christ’s death being a sacrifice, it is also a substitution, “God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God” (2 Cor. 5:21).  Isaiah the prophet also makes mention of Christ’s substitutionary death when he wrote these words, “But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, and by his wounds we are healed” (Isaiah 53:5). That God would go to such a great length to redeem man, and restore a broken relationship reveals the love that motivates God to act in such an irrational and illogical way. The Apostle Paul comments on the irrationality of the cross in the first letter to the Corinthian church in chapter one and verse eighteen, “For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.”  For the Christian, all that encompasses Christ, his work and person are central to the life of faith of His followers. Our sinfulness is the cause of his journey. Whether or not, the Augustinian concept of original sin is true, the Apostle Paul states that “all have sinned…” and even the Psalmist in Psalm 51, writes in the fifth verse, “Surely I was sinful from birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me.” From the time we are born, we are bent towards selfishness. Even though Christ triumphs over our sin at the cross (cf. Col 2:13-14), we can like Paul say, “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me…” (Gal. 2:20). There are times when my flesh wiggles it’s way off the cross. So, I see salvation as work in process, and an event. This is known as sanctification, of which there are two parts. Positional – who are are in, and because of Christ’s death on the cross, and progressive, the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives to conform us to the image of Christ (cf. Romans 8:29).

      I had lunch today with the Middle Schoolers at Marlow Middle School. They are fun bunch of kids. I got to exercise my mad skills on the basketball court today at lunch. Sixth graders made me look silly. Anyway, it was a lot of fun.  As for now, I have been trying to log on to my course work website at LCU, and the server must be down or something, because I can't log on. Arrgh! Technology just complicates life. Doesnt' mr. cyberspace realize that I have a discussion board post due tomorrow? I guess not.   Since these are random musings of a Youth Minister, here goes...  My brother in laws, are being shipped overseas soon again. Both of them are in the Marine Corps. Thank you to all the service men and women who are daily in the line of fire, protecting our country. God bless.  Jen and I might be traveling to Yuma, AZ in a few days to help out Jeff and Heather.   The business of the church is serious business, it's time we get serious about the buisness of the church, and not just be busy doing church buisness.  If a woodchuck could chuck wood, what happens to the little fellows teeth?  Why do we say we are going "to church" when "the church" is people?

      I was reading in the Gospel of John, and the account of the woman caught in adultery in chapter eight along with the lengthy dialogue that follows between Jesus and the Pharisees, has long been one of my favorite stories. Actually, it's not just this chapter, it's the whole Gospel. Jesus makes some revealing statements that angered some, and ignited interest and devotion among others. In John, Jesus is presented as revealing His God-self not just through His miracles, but in His words. The One standing in the Galilean dirt equal with God? Why, God doesn't' have blisters on his hands, nor callouses on his feet. Does he? Surely to think of God standing face to face with us sin-stained souls absurd. We like a God that makes sense, one whom operates within the realm of logic. But for a group of people who believed God created the heavens and the earth, gave two wrinkled bodies a baby turned the Nile into blood, parted the Red Sea, God becoming a man was beyond their ability to accept. Is not God God. He can do that which is impossible for us to even fathom,and yet we complain when He does. Who do we think we are anyway? For some of us, we think we "god." May we not lose the notion of mystery that surrounds God.

      Sometimes I wonder if what I am teaching in class is connecting with my teens. Last night was one of those nights. We were talking about balance and priorities, and I just felt like I was boring the pants of my kids. It's time like that, after class, I go home, and wonder I am in Youth Ministry to begin with. I am not just trying to dump on myself. I think ministers go through times when the wonder if they are doing any good.   For now, today, is a brand new day full of opportunities, and surprises. My prayer is that I will notice God's gentle nudge as I go about my affairs.

      My little girl is the sweetest little thing. She is so full of life. Her smile can turn mr. grumpy pants, and into a happy camper. She has no worries. She doesn't question whether or not, her mommy or daddy are going to be there when she needs us. She isn't concerned with name brands, and nice cars. No, her life is centered on her parents love.   Jesus told a story about children, and how we are to be like them to enter the kingdom of Heaven. Nine months of watching my daughter has opened up this Scripture.

      After several pots of coffee, and a couple of hours of sleep, I am back to being able to write. My wife and I, this past weekend were in Tulsa with our teens, and young kids and their families for the LTC convention at the Tulsa Convention Center. This was my first year attending an LTC convention. It exceeded my expectations. I was encouraged by seeing all those young men, and woman using their God given talents, and abilities for His glory. LTC 2005, should be prove to be once again, a truly remarkable weekend.  On a side note, our group will have many stories to tell. The emergency roadside stop along Interstate 35 will forever live on in my mind as one of the funniest, grossest, and saddest road trips I have ever been part of.

      From the ash heep to the accident. Every where from prison to the prom. God's message in the incarnation is, it doesn't matter where or what, because I love them, I will come. So He did, and still does.  His arrival has left the world divided into two halves. Before and After. His coming shows that God will do what it takes to be near His people. His death is a demonstration of the Father's devotion. His resurrection assures us that His coming was not in vain, nor is our faith. For if the resurrection is a hoax, our faith is worthless. My faith is not worthless.

      It's easy to teach my teens that God loves them and forgives their sins, but why is it so hard for me to accept that same love and forgiveness that I proclaim to them?

Christianity is God coming to men and women through Jesus Christ, offering them a relationship with Himself". -Josh McDowell

Our pulpit minister and his daughter are preparing to travel overseas for mission work in Slovokia and they will be gone for about a month. I will get to be more involved in day to day ministry at the church. "God what are you up to"?

      Our service project went well. Our kid's were exposed to the "other" side of our community. The "other" side being of course, the place where people struggle to pay their bills, aren't sure where there next meal is coming from. The place, where children don't always enough to eat.   I am proud of the Youth Group kids that have come on a regular basis to serve even in small way. Teens, your service is a ripple in this big pond we call the world.   Tonight, I hosted our Youth Group's Thursday Night Bible Study. We've been studying the Gospel of John. We focused tonight on John 6, and Jesus' astonishing words, that He is the true bread from heaven. Serious theology!

      The other day, my wife and I were bathing our incredibly cute and wonderful nine month old daughter in our kitchen sink. Our daughter loves her bath time. She discovered how to splash. She would hit the water, and her mommy and daddy would laugh. She made a mess! After we took her out of the water, her mommy dried her off, and daddy cleaned up the kitchen. Haven't we done the same in our lives? We've discovered how to make messes, and boy  do we mess. What's cute for a baby is not cute for those of us who have ever lived in rebellion. But, our loving Father does what any dad would do after his daughter's bath, clean up our messes.  I think there is a double metaphor here. The second one is this: We come to God, stained with sin, grief stricken, and burdened by life's bad choices, but in the water (baptism), we come into contact with the Father through the Son, and His blood cleans up the messes we make. This doesn't discount faith or grace. For heaven's sake, Baptism is a passive act. It's a strange thing really...You would expect something greater knowing the God revealed in the Old Testament. A booming voice from heaven. Parting the baptistery, or something miraculous. But baptism, it's so, so simple. Baptism is about dying to self, and living for Him.   "Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life" (Romans 6:3-4).

      One of the greatest joys I have thus far experienced over the last 27 years has been the birth of my daughter. She is almost 11 months, and I can't quite describe what it's like to know that God has entrusted me to father this little girl. It is just amazing!  Next to diaper changing (after several hundred dirty diapers you better have a sense of humor), seeing my little one crawl, hearing her say Bible, watching her reach out her hands for da-da, holding her, the most precious of these moments to me is watching her sleep. She is just so peaceful, and knowing that she can sleep in my arms ignites a yearning for my heavenly Father like never before. Holding her tonight, I was flooded with emotion, and this thought, "she will see her first picture of God through me." How do we cope with such responsibility? I think Jesus would advocate the one day at time approach. Bathe the whole process in prayer, absolutely, but just enjoy each day, and the time that we share. The greatest gift we give our children is our time. Thank God that He doesn't turn us away because He is too busy reading the world news, or watching the angels play the demons on HSPN (Heaven Sports Network). When His children call, they are the most important thing in the universe. Now that's a father.

      I have a hard time believing I am not dreaming sometimes. I have a beautiful wife, an adorable daughter, a great church that pays me to be their youth minister, some truly remarkable kids in our youth group, and have seen doors of opportunity open that I never dreamed possible. I marvel at all of this, and wonder how this can be? I am constantly in awe at God's gracious hand, and His leading. I want to share a quote that sums up the last year of my life. This quote comes from Rick Warren's Purpose Driven Life pg. 174-175, "When Joshua was faced with an impassible barrier, the floodwaters of the Jordan River receded only after the leaders stepped into the rushing current in obedience and faith. Obedience unlocks God's power. God waits for you to act first. Don't wait to feel powerful or confident. Move ahead in your weakness, doing the right thing in spite of your fears and feelings."   I didn't grow up in the church, so I when I consider at where and what I came out of, I just marvel at God. Being in Oklahoma is one of those God orchestrated events that only He could have planned.   This next little devotional piece was written shortly after Jennifer and I moved from Ohio to Oklahoma last August.  I have to admit, I was facing a crisis of faith. I heard the call of my Master, and though the wind and the waves were pounding the boat, I stood up, placed one foot over board, and soon the other one followed, and I was walking towards Jesus. It never occured to me that I was walking on water until, I took my eyes of Christ, and looked at the waves, then I realized that the wind was howling around me, and I was terrifed. I lost my confidence and I began to sink. Just before going under, I did the only thing I could do, I called out to Jesus. In typical Savior fashion, He reached out His hand to catch me at the right time.      The little exerpt above, could have been a journal entry in Peter's peronal journey. The story of Jesus calling Peter out of the boat, and Peter's subsequent water walking feat is recorded in the Gospel of Matthew. But isn't Peter's experience similiar to our own. It has been for me. No, I have never walked on real water, but I have been called by Christ out of the boat, and like Peter, I was walking just fine until I took my eyes off of my target, off of my Jesus. I was drowning, the waves of doubt and wind of fear were all around me, and I felt alone. Like Peter, the Hand that reached to rescue the sinking apostle, is the same Hand that reached  down to rescue me.       Recently, I was feeling alone, and dreading some changes, but thankfully, I had several wonderful people not give up one me, and more than that, my God did not give up one me. Isn't it funny, how sometimes, we fret over trivial things, but somehow, the devil knows just how to tweak these experiences to fill our hearts and minds with doubt and fear? This morning at church, the pulpit minister delivered a message that was right from the heart of God. See, this morning on the way to church, I asked God to let me know that He was near, and that everything was okay. I was floored at the timely and relevant message. The preacher talked about facing future fear, and how even though there are trying times, our God has not abandoned us, but has gone before us to help us through.       I learned yet another lesson in fatih and trust in God. It is easy for me to tell others to trust in the Lord, but I have been like Jacob a little to often, wrestling with the Lord. You would think by now, I would learn not to wrestle with God. I am thankful, that He puts up with me, and has used this most recent situation to lovingly instruct me about where I put my trust.   "Thank you Father, for your loving kindness, and your unwillingness to give up on me, even when I feel like giving up myself. I ask that you help those who receive this e-mail who may be struggling in thier walk with you. Help them not to fear, but to trust you. Help them to see your goodness, and Father, like you did for me this morning, show yourself to be very near to your children, in Jesus name, amen."  In case you were wondering, I had a hard time adjusting to being away from family, and all that was familiar. I have learned what the Apostle Paul wrote, when God spoke and told him that "his power was made perfect in our weakness." Now granted, I don't have it all figured out, but one I thing I do know, God is good, and actively working out the deatalis of our lives for our own good of course, even if life and our circumstances don't make sense. God's goal for us is Christlikeness.

      Here is list of the things that are church is preparing to undertake. Most of these will be youth ministry specific.  1.  urlLink Camp  - In this case I am going for two weeks, one week of high school and the second week is grades 4-12 2.  urlLink Wilderness Trek  - a great time of spiritual renewal, and the great outdoors 3.  urlLink Won by One Concert  - The a capella singing froup from Pepperdine is going to perform a one night concert for us 4. VBS - This year's theme is Elijah 5. Teen Mission Trip to Ohio - Our kids are doing some work at Midwestern Children's Home, and also build relationships with other teens that live, and worship in Southwest Ohio.  Needless to say, youth ministry is a very busy ministry. There is a struggle that I think every minister battles with regardless of his ministry focus, and that is one of balance. I leave the office, and head home, and there are several cares, and burdens from the day, or that the teens are going through that I could lend my time too, but I have a family, that needs to know that I love, and cherish my time with them. So, in the crazy, and exciting world we know as ministry, I think the best medicine for now is to bask in the Savior's presence.

                          "Who is he, this King of glory?                           The LORD Almighty-                           he is the King of glory. "                                  --Psalm 24:8   A word from the Word: Read Mark 2:1-12  "...Who but God can forgive sins!" Mark 2:7 (NLT)   Food for Thought: Who but God...    Who but God? The question was asked by the Religious elite. Those with PhDs and MDivs. "Who but God can forgive sins?" They were right in their theology, but they weren't about to admit that a carpernter from Nazareth was God incarnate.See, they had God figured out. They knew how He would operate, and to whom He would operate for. Salvation was an honor to be received for those who worked really hard to be religiously righteous. Now this day their time tested truth was challenged. Standing before them was the One whose word they taught. As was the case when Jesus went to a town to teach, the place became packed. Let's look at what Mark has to say about this scene.    "2 Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there wasn't room for one more person, not even outside the door. And he preached the word to them. 3 Four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat. 4 They couldn't get to Jesus through the crowd, so they dug through the clay roof above his head. Then they lowered the sick man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus. 5 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "My son, your sins are forgiven."  6 But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there said to themselves, 7 "What? This is blasphemy! Who but God can forgive sins! 8Jesus knew what they were discussing among themselves, so he said to them, "Why do you think this is blasphemy? 9 Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man, `Your sins are forgiven' or `Get up, pick up your mat, and walk'? 10 I will prove that I, the Son of Man, have the authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, 11"Stand up, take your mat, and go on home, because you are healed!"  12The man jumped up, took the mat, and pushed his way through the stunned onlookers. Then they all praised God. "We've never seen anything like this before!" they exclaimed."    Despite the grumbles of the Religious leaders, man who had been lame was made well. He was lowered on a mat into the middle of the room. A mat where he spent most of his life lying and watching children run, lovers dance, and countless others walk. This day would be different, this day he was going to see Jesus. Surely news had to have spread to this man's home. Maybe he thought it was a long shot, but he found a way to meet the one others were calling the Christ. One touch from the hand of God. One word spoken from the mouth of God. And stiff, rigid legs began to have feeling. First a tingle down the left leg, and then suddenly a burst of sensation as nerves were made new, and muscles made strong. He came to Christ as a cripple, but he left via the front door, mobile and made new.    Don't we come to Christ that way? Maybe we're not crippled physically, but the pain of the past, coupled with the burden of guilt we've been living with has crippled us in a spiritual sense.Unable to enjoy life. Unable to walk with confidence thatr our lives are directed by the Master's plan. What is crippling you? Is it fear? Whatever it is, we cling to our mats. We cling to the familiar. It may not be  the best place to be, but it's all we know. We've been there so long, we don't know how to walk anymore. Deep within, there is a desire to get beyond our mats, but we're afraid of what's out there, so we stay there.     The onlookers in the story praised God for the healing of the lame man. Theydidn't seem to have a faith problem linking the power of God with Jesus. The religious leaders asked "who but God can forgive sins?" With actions that said, "Your right. No one but God can. That's why I am here. Because I can!" The onlookers had witnessed a wonderful act of love. They learned a lesson that we need to learn everyday, when Christ is near, expect the unexpected.    Though the question was asked, "Who but God can...?" It's a good question to cnsider when we find ourselves stuck on our mats. God can, even when, no especially when we can't. Together, with God's touch, we can. See, when God shows up on the scene there is no room for crippling fear or paralyzing doubt. Amen.

      If the church is to be one, why are we so divided?  If the heritage we share as the "churches of christ" was started as a unity movement, how come some of our brothers would rather hide themselves in self made barracks then join in the fight against the evil one?  What's with the "brother in error" label? Aren't we all humans susceptible to being in error at some point?  A question from one of my teen girls last night...Why does God allow bad things to happen? Don't we wonder this question alot. Job may have wondered aloud all the bad happened to him, but instead answering the mystery, God gave Job himself. Is that our answer today? When we need details, God reveals himself. I would rather have God, than all the inner workings of the world's problems.  Are we all going to be the same height in heaven?  How many licks does it take to get to the center of a blow-pop? Does it even matter?  My dad's favorite...if a canoe had wheels how many pancakes would it take to cover a dog house?  Why does God put up with humanity? I know He loves us, but have you ever stopped and thought about this? Most of the world lives like He doesn't exist, those that do believe in a higher power have convulted His truth so much, that much of the religious world is even divided over who, what, where, this God is. We lie, cheat, steal, murder, commit adultry, abuse drugs, abuse each other, and how this must hurt God's heart. Thankfully the answer to deepest longings, and our sin problem is Jesus. I can think of no better way to spend my time, or use words to mention that in the person of Jesus Christ, God has revealed His heart, and enabled us broken down, messed up sinners to spend eternity with Him. It's just simply amazing.

      Youth group started like most other youth group gatherings do. Teens talking, laughter, typical teen stuff.  Last night we began talking about "temptation." We had some good conversation, and we used as our initial Scriptural introduction, James 1:13-15. I also had the kids list the top temptations that teens are faced with, and then tried to narrow it down to the top five. Here are the top five: 1. Sexual temptation 2. Gossip 3. Swearing 4. Disrespect to parents 5. Drugs/Alcohol/Smoking  I don't know what the top five teen temptations would be across the country, but I'd be willing to bet that they are pretty similiar. What I think is also interesting, the older you get, the top five tempations change. Don't worry, I am not going to list my top five, but if you were to make a list, what would they be?  The teens don't know this yet, but where we were last night in conversation is moving us closer to a couple important truths. 1. The mind is often the greatest battle ground of tempation.  2. Tempation is not sin 3. The characters in the drama of Scripture were human beings, who     didn't always make the right choices, and that if God can forgive     them, He can, and will forgive us when we fall.

      On a more serious note, I really do think it amazing that 27 years ago, God allowed two inexperienced parents to give birth to the likes of me. Their upbringing, and love would mold me into who I am today. Born and raised in Southwest Ohio, now living in Southwest Oklahoma. It's weird, and mysterious how God moves, and guides our lives.   As a boy, I wanted to be either He-Man, or my dad, who by the way was the closest thing I saw until I saw pictures of Arnold Scwarzanegger (sp), and then I wanted to be like Arnold, until I met Jesus, now I want nothing more than to follow in His footsteps, and hope that one day when my little ones say that they want to be like me, I can breath a sigh of relief, and tell them about Jesus, and why I am following Him.  My fondest brithday memory was probably around my 18th birthday, when my parents gave me 1992 chevy s-10 pick-up truck as a birthday present, and an early graduation gift. OKay, that's not entirely true, any birthday with chocolate cake, ice-cream, and my family was memorable. What does my wife have up her sleaves this year? Hmm, chocolate cake anyone. A freind of mine,  urlLink Jeff Slater  mentioned he may begin running today to get back into shape, "Jeff, just one thing, do you want a piece of my birthday cake first"?

      I don't know why, but there is stangeness in the air today. Yesterday I was four years away from 30, this morning when I woke up I am only three years away from 30. Yikes! Pull out the wrinkle cream, and order me some cholestrol medication. What is it about getting older that bothers people? I am not really bothered by my turning 27, it's just that in 1095 days I will be 30. My twenties are all but almost over. What shall I do?

       urlLink Travis Stanley  had a link to see what theologian you were like. I thought it amusing. I was an Augustine. He was my favorite personality my Intro. to Christian Thought we studied at  urlLink LCU .         "God will not suffer man to have the knowledge of things to come; for if he had prescience  of his prosperity he would be careless; and understanding of his adversity he would be senseless."         You are Augustine!   You love to study tough issues and don't mind it if you lose sleep over them.  Everyone loves you and wants to talk to you and hear your views, you even get things like "nice debating  with you." Yep, you are super smart, even if you are still trying to figure it all out. You're also  very honest, something people admire, even when you do stupid things.        urlLink What theologian are you?   A creation of  urlLink Henderson

      The short conspiracy...  I am not very tall. I probably only stand about 5 foot two. I am taller than my 10 month old daughter. Anyway, being that I am short, I have trouble buying clothes that fit. Yesterday, case in point, I was trying to buy some new shorts for the summer, and well everything I tried on is so long. It looked like I was trying on capris (sp). After an unsuccessful day of clothes shopping, I have decided that retailers are biased against short people, so I am going to draft a bill for my senator that would give short people equal access to quality clothing, and while I am at, maybe also suggest that all manufactures make two set of product, one for the average in height, and the other set for those of us who are vertically challenged. By the way, I prefer "short" over vertically challenged.

      Discipleship 101...  Getting out God's way and letting him take first place in our lives is the essence of discipleship. John Baptist, when asked about the lamb of God, and the ministry of Jesus in John 3:30, said the "he must increase, I must decrease." I would say old John the Baptist hit the nail square on the head. Discipleship involves abandoning self, and the little pseudo-kingdoms we hold so dear, and allowing the kingdom of God to reign in our lives. Jesus told his followers in Mark 9:34 and following, "If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it. What good is for a man to gain the whole, yet forfeit his soul? Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul? If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his Father's glory with the holy angels."  I know that for me some of the toughest language in Jesus' words were the words deny self. It goes against our nature to deny ourselves. At least in this country where we are so used to getting everything we want. The very concept of denial is foreign to our way of life. That doesn't mean that Christ's words are any less important because the American way of life is in complete contrast from His way of life. Jesus' declaration about what it takes to be a follower of his are strong words, strong words meant to separate half-hearted followers from real disciples. The shock value in Jesus' words would have no doubt been just as strong in His day as our own, but still his desire for whole-hearted, self-denying, unashamed Christians to follow Him still stands.

      Yesterday in Bible class I asked my junior highers to define what the Gospel is. I put them in groups, and had them list what they thought the gospel is. They all knew it meant "good news." But, I was pushing for more depth (not always an easy task with junior high kids). Here are some the responses on their lists: 1. a type of music 2. good news 3. something that involves Jesus 4. something that involves us 5. The first four books of the New Testament  I had them turn to 1 Corinthians 15:1-8, and had them read there, and then asked them to tell me what the Gospel is? They were surprised at what they found out. That Jesus' death on the cross for the forgiveness of sins,  burial, and resurrection three days later constitutes the gospel. I had them do this exercise because in church they hear the word "gospel" often, but often aren't told what "gospel" is and as we are embarking on our journey through the book of Galatians, the Apostle Paul uses this word often.   Knowing why the good-news is good-news is important, it's foundational to living as a Christian. I suggest we all spend some time reflecting on the gospel and what it means for us in everyday life. But, don't take my word on it. Read 1 Corinthians 15, and see if you come away with a clear picture of the Gospel.

      Sunday...  Some Sunday's seem almost to ordinary. I hate to admit it, but I know there have been times when Sunday seems almost too routine. Church starts at 9am, there is usually three songs, and opening prayer, two more songs, and then communion, contribution, followed by Scripture reading, song before the lesson, the lesson, followed by the invitation, closing prayer, and a dismissal song. When every Sunday is the same, it's hard not to get into a dismal routine of mundane worship. I am not sure that alot of us know it is to prepare ourselves for worship. A dear brother in the Lord has a great post about preparing yourself for Sunday, on Saturday night. His words convicted me. Check it out at  urlLink www.russellheil.blogdrive.com   Yesterday was one of those awesome moments, when you have a need, and God speaks through the message to bring about life change. The topic dealt with marriage, and families. Jen and I had a conversation on Saturday night that was one of those emotionally charged moments where two people don't see eye to eye, and eventually we were able to reconcile our differences. So, Sunday morning was a surpirse. Can you say convicted? I was. I needed to be reminded of my role as a husband, and the God ordained idea of marriage is to leave, cleave, and weave (Gen. 2:24). I have learned that at times I haven't totally leaved, and cleaved.  The point of all this is to go to church expectantly, not dismally. God speaks when you are listening. Are you listening?

      The kiss of heaven?  Wednesday night in our youth group meeting we finished our section on trials, and I got to share some of my heart with my kids. I love them, and would do whatever it takes to help them with their problems. Somehow the conversation turned to looking at how God is working in their lives, and I talked about noticing the flowers blooming, the green grass, the wind, and I asked them if they stop to ponder creation. "No", they don't have time to stop usually. Anyway, I told them, the next time they are outside, and a gentle breeze comes out of nowhere to imagine that as God blowing them a kiss. I thought they thought I was crazy (which is only partially true), but after class one our adult volunteers thanked me for that analogy. We all need to be reminded that behind the scenes lies a God is living and actively working out the details of our lives. He has not abandoned us, He is the God that never sleeps (Psalm 121), and works all things for the good of those that love God (Romans 8:28).   Ah, can you feel the gentle breeze?

      They made it home!  Yesterday, I got to see my wife, and daughter again! They had a nice visit with family in Ohio, and boy, I am glad that they are back. But Rachel, still under the weather. She is congested, and coughed a bunch last night on the way home. She was hurting, and frustrated, and sounded awful, and after each real big cough she cried, and finally fell asleep in the car. 3.5 hours in the car wasn't her idea of a good time, but she did well.

      20 Then Jesus entered a house, and again a crowd gathered, so that he and his disciples were not even able to eat. 21 When his family heard about this, they went to take charge of him, for they said, "He is out of his mind."  22 And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons." 23 So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: "How can Satan drive out Satan? 24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. 25 If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. 26 And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. 27 In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house. 28 I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. 29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin." (Mark 3:20-29)  An observation pertaining to this passage...Jesus mentions that a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand. His application of this statement follows charges that He was possessed by the devil, and through Satan's power was driving out demons. On the flip side of the coin, what about God's kingdom? How much damage has been done to people who have killed, pillaged, and destroyed others who didn't adhere to the same religious doctrines as the party elite? In Christendom, our story is all too tragic. Since Martin Luther, individual groups have fought for equal air time, but in doing so, cut off those who weren't from the same mold. In our modern restoration motiff, we have seen nearly two dozen sectarian groups emerge from what started as a unity movement to unite the Christians in all the sects. Now, our unity movement is one of the most segemented religious groups in the country. A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand. Since we cannot stand, let's join one another on our knees and plead for revival, but may we pray like the dear Chinese Christian who prayed for revival too, only that it would begin with him.

      I know that sin is deceitful and destructive. I wish it wasn't so, so, well fun at times. I appreciate those who have plodded along before me, and are honest about the struggle they have with their flesh. It seems that Christians like to pretend they don't struggle, and that everything is squeaky clean. I read a quote from Rubel Shelly in his commentary on the Fruit of the Spirit, he talks about how we are dead to sin, and that like Paul we have been crucified with Christ, but there are times when our flesh finds a way to wiggle of the cross. Can you relate? I know I can. I don't want to sin, I don't want to speak angry words, and loose my temper or look to long at something that isn't wholesome. But in total honesty, there are times that I loose the battle. I slip up, and fall. I am learning that this time after the fall is crucial to the building up of my faith. In the days after the fall (add your sin here_________) the most important thing to do is to not give up. Repent, confess your sin, and remember that " ...he (Jesus) is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because always lives to intercede for them. Such a high priest (Jesus) meets our need - one who is holy, blameless, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens. Unlike the other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices day after day...He sacrificed for their sins (and mine and yours) once for all when he offered himself" (Heb. 7:25-27). And so go to God, broken, honest, and wounded, and confess your pain, your guilt, and sin, remember that the sin you confess, is obliterated at the cross. "Let us fix our eyes on Jesus..."( Heb 12:2), especially after we sin, his love for us is bigger than the ugliness of your defeat, and His blood shed at Calvary makes you clean. No ands, ifs or buts, just cleansing.

      Jen called me later this afternoon for a daughter update. Rachel is acting more herself. I do miss my wife, and daughter!

      My daughter went to see the doctor today. I couldn't be there. Her doctor visit was some 900 miles away from where we live. She has a viral infection, and her ear drums are depressed. I guess the deal with her ears is due to flying. She is also teething, I guess her first tooth has finally surfaced, and with a new tooth comes a temperature, and discomfort. It hurts to see our little ones hurt. I would give anything to trade her places, and take all of her pain and discomfort on myself. I can't wait to see her soon. Daddy is praying for you honey!

      I realized something about myself this week. I don't handle stress on my own very well. I know all the right answers, and all the right words when my teens have a crisis. But, I leave little room in my own life for dealing with my own failings, and shortcomings. I have found then when I live day to day in my own strength, I don't last as long with my batteries having been charged by Jason rather than Jesus. This weekend was no exception. I spent less time on my knees, and doing ministry, that I totally wasn't ready for the fiery darts of the evil one when they came. And boy did they come, and I was caught off guard.   After my fall, I went through a whole range of emotions. Anger, guilt, shame, fear, despair, etc. In these moments of utter weakness, and despair I need to be more open to the grace of God, and His forgiveness. I have a hard time accepting His grace when I did something I shouldn't of, or spoke words that shouldn't been said. The Bible is clear that where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more, and while this is not a license to sin all you want, it sure does make me feel a little better to know that when I mess up, God is there to apply the salve of His grace and mercy. It is that hope after a defeat that I cling too, that this God I serve, and strive to imitate daily will accept me in my sin, and weakness and apply His healing touch to a wounded sinner desperately in need of His reassuring word.

      I am alone. My wife and my daughter are spending the night with her grandparents, and they are catching a plane to Ohio to spend time with Jen's brother before he goes back to Iraq. My wife and daughter fly home on Thursday. I don't like being alone. You get used to being around people, around the ones you love, that even for a few days any separation is not a joyous time.   I don't know what it is, but I could have been nicer today before they left. Stress about our Senior Reception, sermon preparation, lack of sleep, one final day of decorating, and the tension of having to say goodbye all caught up with me, and for a little while this morning, the ugly side of Jason surfaced. The side that has no patience, is rude, and selfish. If you're honest with yourself, I am sure all of us have these moments, moments when the monster surfaces. Thankfully, my wife loves me despite my failures, and foibles. Her selfless love for me echoes a love much deeper and more amazing than spousal love. "But God demonstrates His own love for us in this: while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Romans 5:8). I don't understand why God loves us, even at the moments of our worst failings, but the God I read about in the Bible is faithful, even when we are not. I may not always understand, but I don't have to understand the complexities and mystery of God's love to be thankful for what I do not deserve. Thank you Jesus!

      I have a confession...  I am a fan of Survivor, actually addicted to the show is more like it. I have been hooked from the first season. I am trying to convince my wife to let my sign up. But, I don't like bugs, would starve to death if I had to eat bugs and rice for 39 days. But still, maybe one day?  I was glad to see Rupert, the gentle giant, selected as the all time favorite Survivor, and the winner of the additional million. Go Rup!  Some things I have observed about Survivor is that the closer the participants get to the final four, greed takes over, and it seems morality is put on hold all in the name of playing the game. After all, the motto of the game is "outwit, outlast, and outplay." Where does morality come into play in a reality tv show, when the carrot they dangle in front of you is a million dollars. In this last season, lies were told, alliances broken, freindships fractured for what? A check, and a title? Hmm, being on the show is sounding less appealing. Will I watch Survivor in the fall? You bet your last bowl of rice I will. I told you, I am addicted.

      Wednesday's are a special day.   A day when my teens are gathered together. We are working on the being a family thing. But they are together for one hour. They come from a variety of schools, home situations, and life experiences, but still they come.  Our church family eats together. Since Jen and I live so far away from our folks, the church has become our family. We need family time.  Our elders meet, and pray, and share their warmth and love, and it's contagious. I have never seen eight men  so selfless, and dedicated to the Kingdom of God like these men.

      Food for Thought:  Jesus said I am the good shepherd. You are short sighted sheep. I’ve named you, I’ll care for you. Come and follow me. (quote taken from the  urlLink LCU  start page).  The concept of a shepherd may sound a little foreign to us post-modern techies, but the central point of Christ's words is that He is worth our time, our focus, our energy. As we trust Him to lead us, He will care for us, meet, no exceed our needs. We may not be used to the shepherd imagery, but it's a picture that if we allow ourselves to glimpse even a little bit of this rich idea, we will be blessed. Psalm 23, though a little psalm, packs quite a punch. I know many of us have grown up having memorized this psalm, but re-read it, and try to place yourself in the text, as the one being lead by the Lord...  1 The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.       2 He makes me lie down in green pastures,       he leads me beside quiet waters,       3 he restores my soul.       He guides me in paths of righteousness       for his name's sake.  4 Even though I walk       through the valley of the shadow of death,  I will fear no evil,       for you are with me;  your rod and your staff,       they comfort me.   5 You prepare a table before me       in the presence of my enemies.  You anoint my head with oil;       my cup overflows.  6 Surely goodness and love will follow me       all the days of my life,  and I will dwell in the house of the LORD       forever.  Psalms 23:1-6 (NIV)

      Sunday we are honoring our graduating seniors. The behind the scenes prep work that goes into making this day a joyous day for families, and the seniors is quite tedious. My wife, is experiencing major stress. Next time I will ask her before a planning meeting, if she is interested in spear-heading the decorating committee. Some of you are probably saying, "duh," I know better now. My wife and her team have some great ideas, and everything will fall into place.   I am preaching Sunday, and as always about this time, I feel completely inadequate to lead the congregation from the pulpit. In moments like these, I am most needy of God's presence, and reassurance. I do believe I have read somewhere that God's strength is made perfect in weakness ( 2 Cor. 12:9). God sure is strong, because I sure am weak. I am going to present the seniors with what maybe the first "F" that they have encountered in school. Actually, it maybe more near six "F's".  1. Face your fears 2. Forget your failures 3. Follow your faith  Also, as a side note...I covet your prayers for a teen in our youth group who has had a rough year. She is currently in a hospital receiving treatment for severe depression. This young girl and her brother have become precious to my wife and I. Despite her condition, and the miles of recovery ahead of her, she wrote me a note last week that talked about how she  knows  that Jesus is near, and is able to help her through any problem or face any fear that she encounters. One of the items that she brought with her to the hospital was her Bible. "Father, I ask you to surround her with your loving reassurance of her position in your family, and help her see that she is special for who you created her to be, not for who the world expects her to be."

      There is a word found several times in the Book of Colossians that intrigues me. The movement that birthed the churches of christ doesn't like this word much. What is it you ask? It is the word.... mystery. The gospel enshrouded in mystery? Sounds sort of mysterious doesn't it? When we will admit that there are just some things that we won't ever figure out, like the soverignety of God, or the inner workings of the Trinity? Ahh,  but the seemingly unexplainable aside, God has blown aways the smoke in the person of Jesus Christ. While mystery intrigues me, Jesus intrigues me more.

      Last night at our Thursday night Bible study, we had a great night of questions and exploring a side of Jesus we don't like much. What about Jesus could we not possibly like? Good question. In John 13, Jesus is having a meal with his disciples, and gets up from the table and washes his disciples feet. Foot washing was a task for the lowest person on the social chain which usually was your slave. The creator of the heavens and the earth bowing before the Twelve's feet, washing each foot delicately. The same feet that would hours later flee his side. What kind of image of God do we get from Jesus stopped down scubbing the dirt of Peter's gnarly toes? Jesus is reavealing a side of God we need to be more aware of, that He would go to any length to demonstrate His love and devotion to us. But, footwashing. Jesus was a King, why in the world would a king wash his followers feet? Onbject lesson of the first degree. Jesus gave them, and us by the way, an example of the kind of humble service we are to offer to one another. No task is to unimportant for Jesus, and since we are His followers, no task is to unimportant for us.   Also, last night a few of my teens and I went to serve at the Compassion Center. The Compassion Center is a ministry of our church that serves food, provides clothes, and medical care on a weekly basis free of charge to those in the community who need such help. I love to bring my teens into a situation that is different from the nice neat and clean atmosphere they are used too. Our mission as of late has been to once a month bring two big platters of cheese and crackers. The people who have come for help love it, and my teens who have come on a regular basis also enjoy helping others. Jesus said in Matthew 25, that whatever you do for the least of these my brethern you have done for me. I am trying to instill in my students that when they serve food at the Compassion Center, they are really serving Christ through what they are offering to the people at the Compassion Center. Two of the teens who went last night to serve at the CC, came to Bible study and the scence of Jesus washing the disciples feet came alive as they realized how service is connected to the person and work of Christ.

       Wednesday Night @ the Trail   The teens and I began a discussion this evening about the power of words. The timeliness of the topic was just right. Our group has been struggling with rumors, and put downs, and well, other things teens struggle with. Tonight though, was one of those rare moments when I was less concerned with whether or not I had prepared a home run of a lesson, and just let the truth of God's Word collide with the worlds my teens live in. I know that they are affected by the words they use towards others, or words that have angrily been slung at them. Sin is for sure the great equalizer, "all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God" (Romans 3:23). Tonight was a good class.   Good class aside, I still I find myself struggling with this generation of teens. It is difficult to come up with creative ideas, and lessons that engage their attention long enough. My prayer is that I will continue to connect God's truth with their pluralistic visceral worlds. In order for Youth Ministry to continue to thrive in our churches there has to be a seismic shift in the way we do ministry. I am not sure of the details, I do know that the postmodern world has caught the church off guard. When we will wake up? I pray it's not before it's too late.

         He Thought It Well Worth While “ "He was not merely a man so good as to be ‘like God' - He was God. Now this is not just a pious commonplace; it is not a commonplace at all. For what it means is this, among other things: that for whatever reason God chose to make man as he is - limited and suffering and subject to sorrows and death - He had the honesty and the courage to take His own medicine. Whatever game He is playing with His creation, He has kept his own rules and played fair. He can exact nothing from man that He has not exacted from Himself. He has Himself gone through the whole human experience, from the trivial irritations of family life and the cramping restrictions of hard work and lack of money to the worst horrors of pain and humiliation, defeat, despair, and death. When He was a man, He played the man. He was born in poverty and died in disgrace and thought it well worth while.” Dorothy Sayers said that! Quote taken from  urlLink Jim McGuiggan   As we continue to follow our Savior, we can't deny we are drawn to Him. The more time we spend at His feet, the more we want to know Him. This is one obsession that I am not ashamed of sharing. After all, what other obsession can be healthy and give life now and later?

       Finals are finally over!  I just breathed a sigh of relief. I just completed the final week of course work, and took my final exam. A book review, semester project and a final exam. I am glad the semester is over. It's been a very rewarding, thought provoking semester. It may sound a little odd, but after reading all the books, and chapters this semester one of the things I am looking forward to the most is reading. I am currently reading, Our Heritage of Unity and Fellowship by W. Carl Ketcherside, and Leroy Garrett, edited by  urlLink Cecil Hook . I am also reading Student Ministry that Leaves a Mark: Changing Youth To Change The World by Gary Zustak, John Mouton, Kevin Greer, and Josh Finklea and Rumors of Another World, by Philip Yancy.

      What's it mean to be a good dad? I am sure there are a variety of answers, but if you are a father has it ever occured to you that sometimes you don't send the "good dad" vibes to your wife or your child or children? I know sometimes I fail as a spouse and as a dad. Two very special women in my life look up to me to be a provider, protector, poopie diaper changer, prince charming, etc. I love my wife and my daughther very much. I am learning how to be both. Jen and I have been married 19 months or so, and I have been Rachel's daddy for ten months. I don't have it all figured out. I still melt when my wife looks at me a certain way. She is even more beautiful, and attractive today then when we first met. My daughter captured my heart the day she was born. Yes, I am wrapped around her little finger. Being a husband, and dad is hard work. It's a never ending job, and yet it's more than a job. It's a calling. It's a role that mirrors the role of another Husband and Father who stirs within us all the desire to see Him in our human relationships. Can you see God in the people you love?

      I was reading in the Gospel of John today, and came across the raising of Lazarus from the dead. I pray that as we read the Gospels the miracles that Jesus performs don't become common place, or dare I say to "churched." What struck me today was that Lazarus never asked to be raised from the dead. Sure his sisters pleaded for their brother's life, but Lazarus was a victim of Christ's compassion. Jesus is full of surprises, and this miracle is no exception. A four day dead man, walks out of his tomb. Only possible because of the Galilean, with callouses in his feet, and sweat on his brow. I am not sure why the religious leaders wanted to kill Lazarus along with Jesus. I know John records in John 12, that because of what happened to Lazarus many people were believing in Jesus. I was reminded that we all have a story to tell of how we've been touched by the Savior. Not all of us grew up in the church, or were raised in a good home. Some of you reading this could say that you have been through hell and back, and maybe so. But, all of us who have been touched by the second chance of grace has a story to share. Our best witness in this world, as great as our stories are will be the life we live after we share our stories. How are you living?

      Our pulpit minister and his daughter returned home safely from Slovokia. It is sure nice to have them home. Church just hasn't been the same without them. I know the teens were glad to see Liz, and talk with her.   On Saturday, I taught at a Bible Teacher's workshop here in Duncan, over at the Eastside Church of Christ. It was the first time I was called upon to teach other adults how to teach teens. I was a nervous wreck. I am noticing my worries in matters of speaking are really silly. I am learning to trust the gifts God has placed within me. It is a slow process, or I should say that I am a slow learner.

      Our weekend visit to see Jen's grandparents, and her cousin was nice. The funny thing is, on the way to Collinsville, my cell phone seemed to ring more than usual. When I am in the office the phone doesn't ring that much, but when I get out of the office, watch out!  A couple of things I have learned this week, and this evening as well. Putting out fires is a lot of work. It's better to deal with the issue, and look for any deeper systems problems than trying to bury the fire with dirt, which never fixes the problem to begin with. Secondly, tough love pays off. I don't particularly like calling parents to tell them about their child's bad behavior, but when the situation warrants, phone calls are in order. Third, tonight an area wide teen devotional called Sunday Night Live, I had the good privilege of sitting next to man who is mentally retarded. He is a neat man. He loves the Lord, and recently I was asked by Him to baptize Him into Christ Jesus. I was honored. I think I learned more about faith from him than I have from those who are viewed by society and the church as normal. Tonight, during our worship time, this brother, sang from his heart. Being in the condition he is in, the words he sang weren't the words the teens were singing, but he sang anyway. His enthusiasm for Jesus is contagious, and spending time with him makes one wonder who really is teaching who. Thank you Clarence.

      After re-reading yesterday's post, I felt it was a bit negative. That wasn't my intention. It's an observation I have made for quite a few years now. I think the way we do church, or for some of us, the way we play church on Sunday's needs to be re-thought out. Why are we meeting, and for whose benefit? Just some more questions. No, again, let me be clear...I love the church, and am astonished that the Lord has allowed me to be a part of it. After all, I feel I share the brunt of Paul's words to young timothy about being the "chief of sinners."   I want to turn our attention today to ministry. My primary area of concern, and my passion is youth ministry. I love working with teens, and teaching classes, and planning events, and all the other wonderful things youth ministers get to do. Sadly, far to often, we are the only spiritual encouragement some of our teens may receive. Some home situations are such that do not allow for spiritual conversation. Youth Ministry, like every other ministry in the church is a never ending saga. However, after a conversation last evening with one of our teens, I am convinced more than ever that youth ministry is one of the toughest challenges in the church. Case in point, the influence of non-Christian spiritual influence, and the impact of our secular society has created several generations of young people that share what was said about the generation that followed such great men of God like Moses and Joshua. "After that whole generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation grew up, who neither the LORD nor what he had done for Israel" (Judges 2:10). In this climate of moral relativism, and the like, ministry must be approached differently than at other times, but maybe we have more in common with the first century church than we realize. Thiers was a highly paganized society where spirituality came in a variety of flavors. Paul, especially looked for ways to connect with his audience through popular culture, (ie. Acts 17). The point of all this, is that society is changing, our kids are presented an unprecedented number of choices of what to believe, and we still have the task and privlidge of sharing the Good News to a culture, and a generation that has grown up not knowing the LORD or what He has done for those who have gone before us. Some could see this as a dreary moment in our history. I see this point in our history being ripe with opportunity. May we be bold enough to accept the challenge.

      I don't know what it is, but Sunday's frustrate me. Now, before any one jumps on the "Jason's a hertic" bandwagon, at least let me say this...I am tired of seeing people come to church hurting, burdens weighing them down, and weary from the pounding they have taken the week before, and leave the worship hour with little or no change in thier dilema? Why do we allow people who are hurting to just pass us by? When did church become a place of proper etiquite, and nice dress? If we are the community of Christ, then shouldn't we be an open place where problems, sins, and struggles are shared, and Christ is encountered through the wounds, and comforting words of others?

      This morning I got the oppotunity to send off 16 of our teens and chaperones. They are headed for Wilderness Trek. This morning I talked about mountain top transformations, and how they were about to embark on an adventure and see sights that a very few of our population has ever seen.   I wish I could have gone, but a surgery about a year ago has limited me to the remain in the Great Plains. Maybe next year?!  I want to turn our attention to sitaution I encountered yesterday, a tragic situation. I have never heard a parent openly admit they have told thier children that they were tired of them, and would like to get rid of them. I confronted the mother, and asked if she realized what those words do a teenager, let alone anyone for that matter? She answered that she did not, but wasn't willing to change her feelings. My heart sank with grief for the two teens who are in a home situation that is just awful. Thankfully, my wife and I have the opportunity to continue to provide a steady stream of love, and support when thier homelife takes a nose dive. I covet the prayers that come across this blog, pray for the family I've mentioned, and that God would make a way where there seems to be no way.

      I want to give a special thanks to the a capella group from Pepperdine Universtiy, Won by One who put on a live show for us last night at Fuqua park. Thier harmony, and lyrics were moving, and we had a decent turn out. About 140 plus came out last evening, to hear some great singing.  My wife, and I, along with the pulpit minister and his wife went to dinner with the group after the concert. They are a good group of college kids. We are kinda partial to the group, one of our former members is in the group, and he has grown a lot as a result of his time out at Pepperdine.

      I can't help but ramble on about camp. Twice during the day, first thing in the morning, and the last thing at night, the campers and the staff would gather around the flag pole out in front of camp, and we would sing, and listen to some great thoughts by some of the godliest men I have ever met.  But the singing at night, underneath the stars, no city lights, just the expanse of the heavens and us. The singing was extra special. It's one of those moments that you're glad you here, but the joy, and awe of the moment make you long for home.   Cellar singing. Who would have guessed it, but on one occasion I got to listen, and sing with the teens in the camp storm cellar. Talk about awesome acoustics. It was the most powerful, heartfelt singing I have ever heard. I couldn't help get caught up in the emotion of the moment, and I wondered what worship was like for the first century church. If they often had to cramp into a tiny hidden room to worship freely? I am sure they did, but cramped spaces aside, praise and worship supercedes any discomfort or lack of a beautiful auditorium. We were there in that cellar united in Christ, and united in song.

      I have to be honest, I was a tad bit apprehensive about going to camp for two weeks. I have never been to camp, and had no idea what to expect. My experience during the last two weeks of camp exceeded any expectations that I did have.   week one: This year out at camp Lu-Jo, a ropes course had been built to help promote group building, and the course was amazing. The high schoolers by the third day that week had become a very close knit group, and they were encouraging to watch cheer one another on. One young man stands out to me, as one of the highlights of my week. About midnight on Wednesday, three boys came over to my bunk to talk about Christ, and ask questions, by 1:30 am one of the boys having not yet been baptized was on the phone and tearfully, and joyfully sharing the goodnews to his dad about his decision and desire to put on Christ. I was blown away that God would allow me the opportunity to share the message of the Gospel even with one hungry young man. The week got better. One of my teen girls, no doubt stirred by the happenings of the week, was spiritually stirred to consider her life, and how to become right with God. Many prayers were answered as this teen girl who just a week before was borderline agnostic, accepted Jesus as her Savior and also put Christ on in baptism. Prayer changes things!  week two: I was exhausted from week one, and after our first staff meeting, I was asking myself "what am I doing here?" But, I turned the reins over to Christ, and made myself His servant, and I was blown away at the opportunities God had given me to share Christ with teens. As I began to encounter the campers on Sunday, and into Monday, I wasn't sure if I would be able to really get close to any of them, but just being there, and having fun with them allowed them to accept me into thier world, and five boys and another girl from my youth group were stirred to study the Scriptures, and I got to share Christ, and His love for them with them. All six of them responded to the life changing message of the Gospel, and I was blessed once again as I was asked to baptize all six them.   I am still in awe at the opportunites God presented to me these last two weeks. For the very thing I wanted to do as a brand new Christian, God is allowing me to do, and that is sharing Jesus Christ and Him crucified to teenagers. There is no other job I would want to have than to work with kids.   I have learned that being there, a positive attitude, a sense of humor, and prayer really do make a difference.   "Thank you Lord Jesus Christ for allowing me to be here in Oklahoma, and for the oppurunites that you presented me these last two weeks. I don't understand how or why you allow someone like me to do things I get to do, but I thank you nonetheless."

      I just couldn't leave the office today without blogging one more time. I don't know what has come over me, it's like I am addicted to blogging or something. Do any of you know of a blog-a-holics meeting I can begin attending. "Hi, may name is Jason, and I am addicted to blogging." Hmm, anyone reading this entry, is probably thinking, "that poor boy, has lost his mind." Maybe I have, but then again, I do suspect that anyone that loves to spend time with Junior High kids is kind of nuts.   Until next blog, may His best be yours, and "let us keep our eyes on Jesus..."(Heb12:2).

      Today will be the last blog for a while. Saturday I am heading to camp for two weeks, and I won't have access to a computer.   So pray for me.  Pray that all the bug stories aren't true, or at least not as true as my teens have made them sound.  Pray that God would move in a special way these two weeks of camp.  Pray that God would help the teachers, and counselors prepare for their time at camp.  ------------------------------------------------------------------- I had to share this story about my little girl. Yesterday she turned 11 months. Where has the time gone? Jennifer called me yesterday after llunch to tell me that Rachel was brushing her own hair. She loves to have her hair brushed, and in her Bible class on Wednesday and Sunday, they sing a song about brushing your hair. I just amazing how much little ones are learning in class. Rachel can also say Bible, and I tried to push the envelop last night and see if would say church, she was trying I think she was making the "ch" sound, and then became interested in her reflection in the mirror. One month from now she will be one, and my folks, and Jen's folks will be in for a week. We are looking forward to our visit, and celebrating Rachel's first birthday.

      Yesterday I had one of those conversations with one of my teens at church that youth ministers long for. The teen told me he needed to talk about something serious. He began his story with what I assumed would turn into a crisis of faith, but I was surprised by what happened next. He told me that for the first time since his baptism that "he knew Satan was at work in the world, and working in his world to try to get him to turn away from Jesus", and then he said, "so I began to think about the cross, and I realized for the first time how personal Jesus' death on the cross was for me". It's the moment that all youth ministers long for. When the months of ministry pay off. I wish each of my 60 or so teens would share  in these grand moments, when they catch a gllimpse of Jesus that  they had never seen, and because of His love they are transformed.

      I know faith is vital part of the Christian community, but sometimes good Christian people just sort of fake faith. As crazy as that may sound, I know far too many brothers and sisters that are faith-sick if you will. They suffer from the world's pressures, and aren't able to cling to the cross long enough to see their God as sufficient to help them through whatever comes their way. I write all of that to say this, our elders are men of great faith. I love to hear them pray. I know that they are just men, but I really feel that our Wednesday night meetings are as about as close to sacred as one can get. When they pray, they move mountains, and to hear them talk about how God moves, and the power of the Spirit is just refreshing, and inspiring. Thank God for good elders.   Ah, but there is such a difference across the board in elders. Some come from a business world mindset, and want to manage the flock of Christ like they would a corporation. The Church is not a corporation, but an organism, and needs elders to shepherd the flock. A shepherd that smells like sheep is more effective than an elder who micro-manages everything from a weekly meeting.   Whatever you current situation with the elders at your church, pray for them. For they do have a challenging task. Caring for souls is not an easy job, and definelty one that should not be taken lightly.

      This morning I was awakened by footsteps on the roof. In my early morning fog, I had so dearly wished it was Christmas morning and the pitter patter I heard was eight tiny reindeer and the big guy in the red suit, but as I came to my senses, I realized where I was. I made my way to the front window and saw a pick-up outside. One of the elders last week told me that an insurance adjuster would be sometime in the near future to check our roof for hail damage. I am waiting for his judgment.  I got to thinking about how easy it is for us to go through our normal routines, day after day, and week after week with little or no thought about our Lord's return. Doesn't He say that He will come like an insurance adjuster in the morning? Or was it a thief in night? In any case, the point of Jesus' words was to be ready, and not to be caught up in this world's affairs that we totally ignore out of this world happenings. Are you ready for His return? Have you ever heard people pray for the Lord to speed His coming? Have you ever considered what in essence they are asking? I'd like to hear your thoughts on the second coming of Christ.

      For several months now, I have watched other children my daughter's age crawl, and do things that she hasn't yet done. One of the big one things that she hasn't done yet that other's were doing was crawling. This week changed all of that. She gets around like an old pro. Her new mobility has given her a new sense of freedom, and new confidence. I am sure most parents can say this, but man she is into everything. It's cute now, but in a couple months when she begins to walk, and really starts touching stuff she is not supposed too, I wonder how cute seeing her little hand grab for things that are off-limits will be then?  In the meantime, I am soaking up the joy of watching her crawl. Rachel has a new favorite game. Actually two, she screeches, and waits for us to screech, she laughs and then does it again, and waits for us to repeat her. And last night she was tampering with the corner of the couch, and looking at me and grinning, she seemed to be testing me. I jumped off the couch, and she laughed, and took off. She wanted daddy to chase her. So I did. I love my little rug rat!  All of this makes me wonder about how God views us. If we are His children, then it must bring Him joy to see us learning new things, and putting those new things into practice. He is always there to remind of us things not to get in, and picks us up when we bump our heads. I am convinced that He loves to hear our laughs, and even enjoys chasing us around the carpet a time or two. I believe parenthood is a mirror, or even a doorway in which God allows us to peer into His relationship with His children. I have sensed more God-moments holding my daughter, and watching her sleep, changing diapers, and chasing her around the floor, than in the last several years as a Christian. Praise God for children!

      Sunday during our song service, several of us sitting in the west overflow smelt an awful odor. I thought it was me, but as the song continued finally someone looked up, and saw white smoke pouring out of the overhead light. We evacuated the overflow, and thankfully there was no fire.   Later that morning, my wife and I went out to eat lunch at a popular local restaurant, and several of the employees were excitedly shouting obscenities about the raging fire in the kitchen. Again, thankfully no one was hurt.   After lunch I began to wonder if someone was trying to tell me something?

      I am approaching my one year anniversary of youth ministry at Chisholm Trail, and well, I'm loving it. Now granted the last year hasn't been a walk in the park, but it's been educational, and pregnant with oppurtunities that I didn't have in Ohio. On this side of year in a new place, it sure isn't as scary as it once was. I am thankful for the changes and the transitions that have taken place in my life over the last year. I have a great church family, and a wonderful group of teenagers. I am amazed that I get paid to do what I love to do. Thank you Lord for this work that you have given me.   I want to turn my attention to home for a second. Jennifer and I adore our little girl. Being a year old, I sense that her life is taking a new approach. I see her personality, and her attempts at independence, and I am thankful that she is still a baby. I know that devolopmentally she will continue to pull alway from Jen and I, but right now she needs me. I love when I come home, and she hears my keys in the door and she begins to grin looking for her daddy. I don't know how you describe those moments. I love when she falls asleep in the evenings on my shoulder, and how she is somehow comforted by daddy's lullabys. I see my little one, and marvel at how truly alive she is, and how much of her mother and I see in her. I am in awe that God would grant me the privilege to raise children, and to think that she will learn more about God through my relationship with here is huge. So, my prayer this morning, and really every morning since she was born, is for God's help in being a godly Father. I want to be like you Jesus, so that one day when my kids say they want to be like me, I can smile knowing they see you in my life.   By the way, Jennifer, if you read this today, know that I love you!

      I just finished a book titled, Toxic Faith. Written by Stephen Arterburn and Jack Felton, it brings the reader into the world of religious addiction. I had never considered religion to be an addiction. Sure I knew of cults, and cultish practices, but what Arterburn and Felton do is they allow you to see some of the skewed beliefs, and the motivations behind those skewed belief systems. The scary thing is, is that you don't have to be involved with a cult to have a toxic faith.   In my early days of my Christian walk I had some skewed beliefs, and I have learned through several years of ministry that many the people that sit in our pews have theologies that aren't based on reality and actually are quite harmful to thier spiritual well being.  In any case, Toxic Faith is a must read. If not for you, maybe for the benefit of someone you know or someone you will encounter who has a religious obsession.

      I try to keep my lawn mowed. Due to a busy youth ministry&nbsp;and the hectic summer traveling schedule, my lawn at times was wild. However, I have a neighbor whose yard looks like the Amazon jungle. If I let my daughter crawl outside, she would get lost. I am even afraid to park my truck in it's normal spot, for I have to walk through my neighbor's yard to get to my door, I need a maschete!   Do you have a neighbor or neigbors like mine? I have to confess, I am compelled to just mow his yard, but then I don't want to be confused as the homeowner. Whatever shall I do?   Dear neighbor, please mow your grass!  Sincerely, the grass nazi

      I have debated whether or not blogs are the right place for political debate. It seems with some of the blogs I have purposefully read, and others by accident, that the blogosphere is used to rant and rave about anything.   I have had an interest in politcs since I was in Junior High. As I got into highschool, I even toyed with the idea of pursuing a political science degree in college. But then it struck me, the definition of politics says alot about the nature of some of the political bologna that occurs prior to an election.   Politics: Really a combination of two words.  Poly,  meaning many  & ticks,  blood sucking creatures .  Just kidding, I thought that those that find this blog by accident or on purpose might appreciate my attempt at political humor.   &nbsp;

      Why I don't have all the answers to above question, I have observed some spiritual people and some not so spiritual people? Maybe the better question is what's it mean to be a Christian. Unfortunately, 2000 years of using the "c" word has dramatically altared it's meaning. You mention Christian at let's say&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Democratic National Convention, and people are ranting and raving about the&nbsp;"Christian Right" and it's fearless leaders Pat Robertson, James Dobson, and Jerry Fallwell. Maybe I am overgeneralizing a bit, but the point is, the word "christian" evokes different meanings for different people.&nbsp;Even in the realm of Christendom, the "c" word&nbsp;elicits different meanings. My particular religious tribe tends to define "christians" as those who adhere to their party line, and I&nbsp;am sure most religious tribes define "christian" the same way. &nbsp;To be spiritual and Christian should go hand in hand. I am not talking about mystical experiences, I am talking about the thrust of our lives as they are enmeshed the life of Christ. Maybe, we aren't spiritual enough? Or maybe being spiritual isn't our problem at all. Maybe it's surrender? Maybe if those who bear the name of Christ lived surrendered lives there wouldn't be a question as to whether someone is spiritual or not?

      My youth group and I just returned from our first mission trip together. I don't know how one defines success on a mission trip. But, if your group of kids is supposed to gel, if the chaperones are supposed to help lead kids closer to Christ, if the devotional times are moving, then I would say that our trip was successful. Being that this was our first extended trip together, I will say that the trip from a planner's perspective was educational. My group didn't grumble any more over some of our rules than another group would have. My kids got to see me vulnerable, and they responded with an outpouring of emotion that won't be forgotten.  I had a great group of adult chaperones, one of them being my wife. I couldn't have asked for more from a chaperone. From cooking to laundry, to cleaning, Jennifer taught me about being a servant, by putting the needs of others above her own.   It was tough to say goodbye again to some special teens from my old church, but you know, one year has provided many oppotunities for growth. And although it was hard to say goodbye, it wasn't as hard because of the teens that I serve now are just as loving, and generous to my wife and I as were the old gang.   It's good to be home, and back with my church family.

      By it's very name it leaves me wondering, "who is on vacation?" I wish I knew, for the director of our church's VBS (your's truly), preparation for this event is no vacation. The last few days have been rather hectic, and stressful. I know of several occasions where my helpers are grumbling about this and that, and the only one who is talking to me about frustrating people or things is my lovely wife, who by the way has helped me greatly to retain my composure at times when we discuss VBS in our house.   I focused on this thought yesterday, VBS is not about me, or any of the other adults in the drama or teaching classes, it's about teaching children about God, and His faithfulness. Why do we adults, complicate ministry. Some of the grumbling I have heard have been along these lines, "if it doesn't go my way, I quit." Where is the Christ-like attitude we are told to have in Phil. 2:5? Making demands is definetly not Christ-like, so stop it! I know that any large event a congregation does increases the liklihood of congregational stress and tension. Not all of this tension we experience in churches is bad. As a matter of fact, tension and conflict can reveal a deeper congregational issue, one that can affect overall congregational help. Boy wouldn't it be nice if people got over themselves, and we started functioning as the church was intended? Could the root of some of our problems be that we don't understand the notion of ekklesia? Aren't the called out ones supposed to be different than the world? The church is a community of sinners touched by the grace of God, in need of His tender touch each day. Shouldn't community be what we are striving for? A place where we stop pretedning to be okay, and allow ourselves to be vulnerable with our brothers and sisters, and more importantly with our Lord?

      Good-byes aren't easy. I still get a little choked up when it's time to say good-bye to my folks and brother after a week together. I know that I will see them in a couple of weeks, as we come to Ohio for our mission trip, but the 900 miles plus that separates us is at times enough to drive me to my knees and seek Heavenly comfort. I long for home, but in these times of longing for home I am reminded of another longing for another home out of this world. A place where there will be no tears, no pain, no death, no tragedy, no sin, just 100 percent in the presence of God. So, as a fellow traveler and follower of Christ, I long for home. I realize my citizenship is in heaven. While I love this land that I call home, it is but a temporary residence, for all those that belong to Jesus Christ are citizens of the kingdom of God.   We had a great week together. Rachel's first birthday was a joyous time. Seeing her get so excited about all the balloons and presents will be one of my fondest memories. Seeing her master stair climbing was also one of those precious moments that I cherish. She only started crawling maybe a month and half ago, and she is already climbing steps, and pulling herself up on things. It shouldn't be too long before she takes her first steps. Yikes!  Jen's parents left last night to spend a few days with Jen's grandmother. I love spending time with them as well. We have a good relationship.    Well, that's it for now, I got to get ready to go to the office.

      I have always liked the letter to the Ephesians. I like it even more. Chisholm Trail is using material from Tim Woodroof this new quarter in our Bible classes on Ephesians. I have only finished studying the background material and part of the first lesson, and wow! Not only is brother Woodroof a gifted Bible student but he presents the content of each lesson in an easy to understand way.   I never considered before just how much the early saints and us 21st century saints have in common. This letter to the Ephesians has really intrigued me because there have been many times over my spiritual pilgrimage I have had a hard time grasping that God's grace is even for the likes of sinful me. So, it stirs great excitement within me to consider that the early saints shared a common struggle. I say all of this to point like brother Woodroof does, that Ephesians is a relevant message for us today. I would like to read any of your comments/thoughts on Paul's letter to the Ephesians, and the relevancy of Scripture to us today. This should make for some good conversation.

      My folks, and brother are in from Ohio. I haven't seen them since March, so you can imagine I am thrilled to see them. They are here to celebrate my daughter's first birthday on July 3. One year ago today, I was working as an Associate minister in Middletown, Ohio with a very pregnant wife who at any moment was ready to pop (sorry hun), and wondering about my future as a father, and as a youth minister in a state I had only visited twice.  Boy how things change. A lot has happened in a year. I am not the same person I was a year ago, neither is my wife, nor our new addition to our family. But the change is a good one. When the going got tough after we moved, and didn't have the support of my family and close friends, I had to rely on the promises of God. That He was faithful, and in control, and that this seemingly difficult circumstance was for His glory, that I would see my folks again, that I would be a good dad, and that the impact I would make in Duncan would make a difference.  On the other side of all that happened, I am thankful for painful circumstances. For in pain, where have to go? I can think of only two options, one of them doesn't get you anywhere, and the second option is the only one that works. That is surrender to Christ. I think that is one of the most difficult aspects of our walk with Christ is surrender. It's easy to recognize Jesus as a Savior, but He is also our Sovereign, and life lived surrendered to the Master produces more blessings. Will hardship come, you bet it will. But I am convinced that there is nothing my Lord and I can't handle.   Last night my folks came to church with us, and ate with us at the fellowship meal before church. My folks are amazed at good the people here in Duncan treat my wife, daughter, and I. They are glad that in their absence that there are many that are taking care of us, and that makes them appreciate the Church more. My brother and dad sat through my Bible class last night, and really that was the first time they had heard me teach a Bible class to teens. I am a little un-orthodox at times, but I think it comes with the territory, teens don't like lecture, but the more animated I can get within reason, they more I gain their attention.   Hopefully, everyone will be getting up soon, I am waiting patiently for eggs, sausage, and biscuits. Have a blessed day!

      Yeah that's right, seven book reviews before September 20th. Why? I am tkaing a graduate counseling course at  urlLink LCU  this fall. I am enjoying the reading. I am being stretched in an area I would like to learn more about. Counseling and youth ministry go hand in hand, so I am trying to approach this class as valuable training that will benefit those I minister to. As you come across this blog, please say a prayer for me, that I won't get bogged down with workload of graduate classes. Thank you.

      Isn't it something that we have access to God at all. After all, considering our sin problem I wouldn't blame God at all for being a God of wrath. But there is more to the story than that. It's amazing that a Holy, and Just God would even consider loving the likes of sin stained humanity. Not only does He love us, that He offers that life changing, soul cleansing love free, even to the worst of sinners. Sounds almost to good to be true. I have heard of some people that stop there. God's free gift of grace is to much. Surely He demands more than just surrendering our lives to His will. There has to be something more? Doesn't there? No. And that's the beauty of grace. Undeserved merit. Nothing we can do can make God love us any less or anymore than He already does. I still find it amazing.  What's even more amazing is that it is the Church where God made all this possible. Reading through the book of Ephesians leaves no questions in my mind that God indeed has a special purpose for thier church. In Ephesians 1, 2, and 3, Paul mentions a mystery that in ages past was kept hidden, but has found fulfillment in Christ. What is this mystery? That Gentiles and Jews are reconciled into one body (the church), and have fellowship with one another and with God is amazing. 20 centuries removed from this letter's writing, we may not understand the impact of Paul's statement. Jews and Gentiles were enemies, long time separated by the expressed intent of God, to create a people to himself, and now to include Gentiles in all of this is absurd to a first century Jew. A people long time regarded as God's own treasured possession now witnessing the inclusion of differernt races into God's fmaily. Wait a minute. It's almost to good to be true. But why?  I have been challenged the last few days to consider the importance of the church in the world. 2000 years ago, a message of reconcliation was preached, Jews and Gentiles heirs together, and sharers together of eternal life through the message of Jesus Christ. The Temple is a good picture of the division of Jew and Gentile. The outer most court of the Temple would have been designated for the Gentiles, as a matter of fact, there were division upon division upon division. The Gentiles were only allowed so far, women were only allowed so far, men were only allowed so far, and the Levite priests were only allowed so far. God seemed distant and at times un-approachable. Then Jesus died for sinners to bring peace to a divided world, the walls of seperation were demolished creating a new community of Gentile and Jew, slave and free, male and female, astonishingly all have equal access to God. No more did common folk have to wait in line, or wait outside, they know because of the precious blood of the lamb could approach the throne of God. Wow! Something revolutionary has taken place in the preaching of the gospel. Think about the impact of the gospel today, if we the church realized the importance given to us by the cross, and the impact we can have on the world today to demolish walls of seperation that exist in our world today.  From here, let's re-examine the nature and function of the church. Let's take Paul's message to heart that in Christ there is no division, and may we come to a place where division, and demoninationalism ceases, I pray for the day when the blood of Jesus will erase all such demarcations.
