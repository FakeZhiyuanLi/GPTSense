      I went to go see Dodgeball today. It was pretty funny.  Stephen Root was in it too.  I didn't know he was til I saw him.  He's a pretty funny actor, I've liked him since NewsRadio.  But he wasn't as funny as the other's in the movie, but he made me smile a few times because some of Bill from King of the Hill and Milton from Office Space came through.  Vince Vaughn was pretty funny too, but his charater kind of bored me.  Not really sure why, but he just didn't entertain me.  Ben Stiller was pretty cool in it.  I've watched alot of movies with him lately and the character he played is alot diffrent then usual (most notably his character in Along Came Polly, where he was just weird).  Rip Torn didn't have his goatee in it, so that was weird, but he was pretty funny too. "I don't have to drink my own urine, but I do because its sterile and I like the taste"  Thats one of his lines.  Lance Armstron, Chuck Norris, William Shatner, David Hasselhoff all have small roles in the movie too, without distracting from it.  They all play themselves too, except for Shatner and Hasselhoff.  But what weirded me out the most is that I thought Jason Bateman was Jerry O'Connell.  Anyway if you like funny movies, check it out.  If you like any of the actors in it, check it out.

      I had posted a review of Spiderman 2 last week after seeing it in the theatre, but my internet connection crapped out and it never got posted.  Then I read a good one in Rolling Stone Magazine that is better then mine.  So go here, but beware, there be spoilers there.  http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie?id=6184934&pageid=rs.Home&pageregion=double1  Anyway the week that I'm only supposed to work 40 hours turned into 45 or so.  The only good thing about that is Sunday was pretty slow I just sat around at talked with the other guys working about....various guy things...yeah.  Worse part about it was that being on salary I don't make extra money for those extra five hours.  But I get two days off in a row, been a long time since I had that.  King Arthur comes out tomorrow, and I want to see it, but might be a while.  F 911 is still on my list of movies to see also.  Maybe rent.    Thats about it.  If you all want to hear a good band, that has tons of CD's (some with just two songs on them) check out Modest Mouse.  There new CD rocks.
