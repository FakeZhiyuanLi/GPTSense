      I've been lazy, which is why I haven't posted in a while.  Anyway today is Memorial Day and it's pretty ugly outside.  I've been working on my Blackjack final for programming.  I am almost done, I just have one more thing to do.  That one thing however, will be a bitch to do.  The Stanley Cup Finals are pretty interesting.  I am having a hard time watching, due to what happened in Game 7.  Calgary leads 2-1 though, Calgary really deserves the Cup.  They've played with basically an AHL defense, rookie goalie, and being the underdog in every round.  The Lakers should wrap up their NBA Western Final series, while Detroit and Indiana might go 7.  After the NBA and NHL Playoffs, it's all baseball until September.  That's it, I'm feeling sick, gotta go.

      Last night was one of the saddest moments in my life.  I watched the final seconds tick away from the Flyers season.  I'm upset that they couldn't pull it out, but looking at it, they got farther than they should have.  They beat the defending Cup champions, the Devils, and The Maple Leafs w/o some of their top defenseman and a rookie goalie.   They took Tampa to 7 games, while having to use basically 4 defenseman.  I'm proud to be a Flyers fan right now, and proud of what the team accomplished.  Hopefully their won't be a labor dispute and guys like Jeremy Roenick, Keith Primeau, Mark Recchi, John LeClair, and many others will be able to lift Lord Stanley's Cup.  Thank you Flyers for giving your fans a hell of a season.  This team will no longer be laughed at for wilting under pressure.  They will be respected for willing their way to Game 7 of the conference finals, while staring adversity in the face.  I don't think I'll be able to watch the Cup finals, knowing that my team came within one game.  This was a great season, and hopefully just a sign of what is to come in future years.

      2 Hours till gametime and I'm on the edge of my seat.   Anyway, it's been a very quiet day.  I didn't get to go shoot pool this week, but next week will probably be good.  It's pretty hot here today, but....boy this entry sucks.  I may as well rant about something that irks me.  My target, people who think they're original because they follow a lifestyle hundreds of others follow.  You know who you are people.  Take goths for example.  I have nothing against them, in fact I know quite a few, and they are some of the nicest people ever.  The reasoning for some is really retarded though.  I live this way to be different.  When people say that, my bullshit detector goes off.  It's only different if nobody else does it.  Nobody is original in their lifestyle, because somebody else already did it.

      Game 7 between Philly and Tampa is tonight.  I'm really nervous right now and there are still roughly 8 hours until game time.  I'm too anxious to type anything interesting, so I'll just post something later.

      Last night was a helluva night.  The Flyers force a game 7 and I am happy.  I going to post some lyrics that I wrote .  Here's one of them.  I'll post them all over time. This is called "History Repeats", and is more of a story I guess, but they're lyrics I wrote.  "History Repeats"  A young boy of ten  laying in his bed hearing his parents unaware of the situation  A young boy of thirteen traumetized by the hatred his father a drunk his mother a victim  A young man of sixteen angered by the treatment this night will be the end he picks up a gun and points it at the man that destroyed his mothers life  His father lay there dead his mother grabs the gun and as she cries takes her husbands sins out on herself  There the young man sits  tears in his eyes cops at his door thank god this night is over  A man of thirty married to a beautiful women two kids in the house nothing could be better  A man of thirty five taking after his father he grabs a gun  and history repeats history repeats  Will this cycle ever end Will this cycle ever end

      Tonight is Game 6 between the Flyers and Lightning.  Hopefully, the Flyers can force a game 7.  My finger is killing me, in fact, it's blue and swollen in places.  I think I sprained it yesterday.  I'm in a rush, so not many details.  I'll try and post later more in depth if I get a chance.

      I know, I'm posting quite a bit today but I really have nothing better to do at the moment.  On to the topic: I know I don't have perferct grammer, but why do people feel the need to abbreviate  everything!   I recently read couple articles on a website that will remain nameless and I could hardly understand what the hell they said.  Here's an example of what I mean [EXAMPLE] i dunno what to do prolly bc j dont no cuz hes got a prob wit his gf over sum biz.[/EXAMPLE] Now what the hell is that.  How hard is it to type with a little bit of intelligence.  I understand the abbreviations like, w/, but that stuff is retarded.  Honestly, typing in understandable sentences isn't that hard.

      It's official, this week sucks balls.  Last night my Flyers lost and I punched the wall, so my fist feels all weird.  Today in gym class, I screwed my finger up playing basketball.  I thought I jammed it, but it hurts really bad, so I don't know, maybe it's broke.  On top of that I have a huge history test tomorrow and a programming test.   If this week gets any worse, I don't know what the hell I'll do.

      Last nights game was bullshit.  There is no way the Flyers should lose this series.  Tampa hasn't gone through any adversity, and the haven't paid their dues.  The Flyers now have to win Game 6 at home and Game 7 on the road to advance.  I can feel the ulcer starting to form already. I will make a prediction though, The Flyers  will  win game 6 and will force a game 7.

      Tonight my beloved Philadelphia Flyers take on Tampa Bay in Game 5.   I hate games that mean so much, since they really grate on me.  Anyway, I realized something today.  Out of all the people in the USA, most of them suck. I'd say the percent is probably about 65% who suck and 35% who don't.  I'm sure most of you realize that alot of people suck, so this is nothing new.  I gotta go, make sure you cheer on my Flyers tonight.

      My friend told me about a band called Epithet.  They're not for everyone, but they're not bad.  Go   urlLink     download Perfect World.   If you like rock music, you'll probably like it, if not don't bother.  I also suggest giving a listen to HIM if you get a chance.

      Just a welcome message to anyone who for some reason, would read my blog.  I will post whenever I get a chance.  I really have nothing to say at the moment so, except that the Philadelphia Flyers will beat Tampa Bay tomorrow in game 5.  See ya in the next post.

      Well, I posted on the 19th, and it is now the 29th.  Anyway, I will be going for my license in about a week or two.  Then watch out people, I'll be blasting my stereo and driving to all kinds of places.  I shot pool again on Friday, and with every shot I improve.  I'm going again this week, I just don't know when yet.  I'm hoping Thursday and Friday, but who knows.  The Yankees are on a roll, and I get to watch two out of the three upcoming games w/ the hated Red Sox.  Anyway, I really have nothing to talk about.  I promise to post with more regualarity(is that even a word), so until then.... see ya.

      I know I haven't posted in a good amount of time, but I've been busy with exams and stuff.  Anyway, last night was awesome.  Me and four friends shot some pool, played some basketball, and some football.  Pool has turned into my third favorite thing to play.  Behind hockey and dodgeball.  Anyway, their is nothing more satisfying than setting yourself up on the table for an easy shot. Basketball is not my specialty though.  I'm good in the post and average on mid-range shots.  I'm more of an assist guy.  Football isn't bad, when I'm quarterback.  However, all the running that comes with being receiver, that just isn't me.  Anyway, thats it for now, I'll post on a regular basis, now that school is out.

      School is almost over.  I have a full week this week and then next week I have to go Monday and Wednesday for exams.  Only about an hour and a half each though.  Then, the first week of July I will go for my license.  I have to say, I am going to miss seeing some of the people from school.  I'll still see my close friends, but not people that I talk to everyday but aren't people that I hang out with usually.  Hopefully, I'll run into them over the summer or something.  I also hope to buy my brothers old car for about $1000 dollars.  Insurance payments are going to suck though.  I just about finished my C++ final, I just need to add a few features.  I'm done now, I'll post more often after school is done for the year.

       I finally go to get my license on Saturday.  I've been a nervous wreck for the entire week.  If I fail, I'll probably go into a deep state of self-pity, followed by another week of nervous impatience, since I'll have to go again.  I think that if I can calm down, I'll pass without much trouble.  That all depends on what I do that morning.  I go for the test at quarter to nine.  I plan on getting up at seven and taking a 20+ minute shower to wake myself up, then I'll probably try and release some tension (how I'll do that, I have no idea), then it'll be gametime.  These are the things that determine the men from the boys.  If I pass, then the joy will not be wiped from my face.  If I fail, then torment will envelop me for at least two days.  I will try my best.  Hopefully, that will be enough.

      Happy 4th of July everybody.  Today is a day to celebrate the freedom that we have.  As my friends know, I have a very strong opinion on the current government, but let the whole nation unite today and remember those that died to give us our freedom.
