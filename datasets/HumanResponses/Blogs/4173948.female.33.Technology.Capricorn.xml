      i've been in scotland for 5 years now and haven't had a decent rpg session yet! seeing as i was heavily involved in our monthly vampire larp and had a weekly (sometimes bi weekly) table top game at my house you can imagine i'm not to happy about that.  had to leave almost all my books at home (can you hear my sobs from here, bet you can!) but i've just got my hands on HOL and Buttery Holsomeness and i'm itchin to find some players...  so if you're interested by all means leave a comment for me and/or email me at HumanOccupiedLandfill@hotmail.com

      well after that amazingly grueling day i could really use a hug... come to think of it, i bet if all those cranky arseholes that called me today had had a hug or two BEFORE they decided to 'grace me with their presence' (yeah right!) maybe they wouldn't have been such eegits!  you know, i once read that to be a truly happy person you need to have 12 hugs a day...12! how many of us get even half that much, honestly? no wonder we're a miserable bunch of gits eh? maybe doctors should stop prescribing prozac and start prescribing hugs... maybe the nhs could save some funds if they had a staff of 'hug volunteers' in fact, i think we could start a medical revolution..... or maybe i'm just dreaming, but while i'm fantasizing i think i'll be imagining this particularly charming and handsome spanish guy i work with filling my hug prescription on particularly bad days.... now there's some medicine that won't require a spoonful of sugar to help it go down ;-)

      you know, i really hate mondays... it's not just that i've only just caught my breath after a (hopeful) 2 days off of work. it's not just because i'm tired and after having 2 days of freedom finally realise JUST how crap being a wage slave really it... quite frankly it's that every moron on earth has decided during THEIR weekend that the sky is going to fall on their heads if they don't get their problem fixed...right away, on the dot regardless of what it is, who they are or however vauge they may be.  honestly, don't these people have better things to do all weekend then stew about minor problems until they make them unsurmountable in their feeble little minds? you'd think i was responsible for half the world crises and maybe even the bubonic plague or at the very least WWII (forget the fact that i'm only 33) to hear these people yammer on at you non stop from 9am monday til whenever you can sneak out of work!  i know i'm not the only CSR (cust ser rep right... more like cannon fodder!) that feels this way... what happened to manners, what happened to logical thought processes...what happened to intelligence in general?  i actually LIKE helping people... i'm told i have a very soothing voice and manner about me. i tend to believe it after i've had so many folks get free psychiatric care from me, i seem to be a magnet for people that need a shoulder to cry (or bitch) on. however, i do have my limits and if people were at least decent about their approach to me i'd be happy to go out of my way to help them. for the precious few that do treat me pleasantly i always DO bend over backward to help, even if it hurts my performance levels . but having done this kind of work 10 years ago and doing it again now i can tell you that somewhere in the last decades manners and common sense went completely out the window!  don't these people realise that you catch more flies with honey than vinegar? why would anyone in their right mind do any more than the basics to help someone that had it out for them from the start even though they know absolutely nothing of that person? i know it's unlikely to change which is most unfortunate, but i can't vent my spleen to them so i'm doing it here...  ahhh now i feel a bit better... but it's monday and i am sure the sky is falling somewhere so if you get through to me you'd best be at least civil or i'll let it fall on your head whilst i conveniently use the trapdoor i've built for this appearantly inevitable occurance!

      some people just have nothing better to do with their time eh? oh well, tis mostly just a place for me to blow off steam and to piss around on at work when i should be doing something more constructive...if it entertains you in the meantime then kudos for me and hey maybe i'll get some good karma bonus points or something!

       urlLink    This is an image I created for a webpage I was planning on building (unfortunately life happened and it was scuppered) Just used colourize on a closeup shot of my eye and then used the cloning tool to clone in a picture of space from NASA for the iris. Placing the star in just the right spot was a bit tricky but well worth it for the effect.  urlLink
