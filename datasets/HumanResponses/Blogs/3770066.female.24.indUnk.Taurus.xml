      So today, I'm up at 6 am to trudge off to downtown Atlanta for my Diversity training. I don't mind the hour and a half drive. . . actually I like the drive. Gives me time to think and all that. What I hate is the traffic (which is why it took me an extra 30 minutes). I have a HUGE road rage problem. I think my job has caused this. . . I seem to have turned into a real bitch since I started it. So I get to Atlanta and wait for someone to tell me where the hell the training room is. The Atlanta office is so big and so easy to get lost in. I finally get to where I'm supposed to be and I see a friendly face. Yay! My pal from my side of town, Dwight, is taking the class with me. Dwight cracks me up all the time. It was so great having lunch with him today. We never get to bond outside of work. He's very funny and very interesting and very cute. Of course, he's taken. Been with the same woman for almost 6 years and he plans on proposing later this year in New York City. *Sigh* Oh well, another guy that I can't have. Story of my life. Of course, I do partly blame him for my dislocated knee (Note to self: if Dwight says to work out instead of sleep, just SLEEP!). Anyway, he said I should get an apartment in downtown Atlanta. . . says it's more my kind of environment. Probably so. Anyway, Diversity training was actually cool and kind of interesting. I feel really bad for all the male bashing I've done in the past. So, if I've offended any man that I know and/or love because of this male bashing, I apologize. So it was interesting and I met some cool people that work in our Atlanta office. And even though it was supposed to last until 5, we are let out at 4. Yay! On the way home, I call my grandmother to finalize plans for this weekend. We somehow get into it about Michael Moore, gay rights, and politics. I think that I may be too opioniated about that stuff. Is that a bad thing? I think I may need to tone it down. I mean, opinions lead to anarchy and all that. Who needs to form their own opinion.? But my grandmother said she doesn't like politics because it pisses her off. And even though she's supposedly pro-choice and pro-gay marriage, she's still voting for Bush. And she couldn't even give one specific example of why she disliked John Kerry. She was very vague, which I found interesting. I mean, if she were a true Bush supporter, wouldn't she have specific reasons for voting for him?? Oh well, whatever. I'm just too political, I guess. So anyway, I come home and my Internet connection (which was not working this morning) is still down. So I spend an extraordinary amount of time on hold with the phone/Internet company. Finally, I talk to a very nice guy and we reboot the router or something like that. And yay . . . I'm online again! Whoosh. . . going through withdrawals alreasy. And then, it's a wholesome snack of Teddy Grahams and milk. Yum, yum. And now it's all about mindless TV time and precious sleep. If you haven't seen the WB show, "Summerland," you should. It's got the Full House chick in it, Lori what's-her-name. Anyway, it's that, Will and Grace, and then sleep.

      Well, it was my first Monday off in a long time. I woke up early to go to my doctor's appointment at 9:45. Of course, I am sore from all the walking yesterday and my knee is killing me. The receptionist acts very smug in telling me that she tried  several  times to call me and tell me that my apoointment was canceled. Yeah, I've gotten no messages on my cell phone and apparently, there was one call on my home phone and someone never gave me the message. Ugh. I could have slapped the receptionist. She needs lessons in customer service. I just want to know the results of my MRI so I know if I need knee surgery or not. I also want to know when I can get this damn brace off. Is that too much to ask. I also want to know when I can exercise again. I was exercising 2 hours a day, 7 days a week. But it's hard to do cardio with a knee brace. I guess I'll just work with weights. . . my upper body needs toning anyway. So I get up early for nothing and go to the grocery store, only to realize that I've left my checkbook, ID, and debit card at home. Of course, I do have enough cash for an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's. Yay. I then come home and spend an exciting day watching soap operas from the 70's. Oh, the joys of satellite. I also burned CD's for my sister and did homework for my diversity training class that I have to take for work tomorrow. Who assigns homework before class anyway?? I'm sure Dos would say that it's a joke having diversity training in Georgia. I mean, there are tons of white people. But Coca-Cola is a very diverse company. . . they were even sponsors of the Gay Pride Festival. At least at Coca-Cola, I do work with more than just white people. I think I've had my fill of close-minded white people. I also registered for the AIDS walk today. Yay for me. Seth and I plan on doing that together. Of course, we know that we're not going to make it the entire 10 miles. But whatever. . . we'll do what we can. And it'll be fun. And it's not till October. Hopefully, my knee will be better long before then and I can train. Seth said he hopes it isn't cold by then. My response is that this is Georgia and it'll be warm until December. I miss Rochester. . . actually, I miss the snow and the people in Rochester. I don't actually miss the town. Crazy talk is what that is. Okay, now it is time for my usual nighttime ritual of Will and Grace before bed. I can't miss a night. And tomrrow it's an early day to face rush-hour traffic in downtown Atlanta. Fun, fun, and even more fun. Bye for now!

      Okay, so I finally gave in a created a blog like my pals in Rochester. . . apparently that's the only way we can know what's going on with each other. So the last day of Gay Pride was bittersweet. Gay people really are the best of all the people. Today was the parade. I saw drag queens and biker chicks and I didn't realize how many gay people there were in Georgia. I mean, dude, what the hell are they doing here??? I don't even want to be here. It was very sweet to see the PFLAG people and all the young kids. Seth and I got a little teary eyed. People are so open and accepting in Atlanta. . . especially during Gay Pride. I especially liked it when they shouted anti-Bush slogans. Bush does suck. Oh, and I got checked out by lesbians, which is nice. At least I know that if I ever get fed up with men, I would have options. We got free condoms too. But Seth gave me his, saying that I would need them before he would. I certainly hope so. Of course, then the flood came and halted the parade. Seth and I got drenched and shared an unmbrella with a lesbian. Good times. Seth is such a good gay husband. I had taken my knee brace off and had to walk in the flood for a million blocks to where we had parked. He was very patient in helping his crippled straight wife. Luckily, my knee didn't pop out of its socket again. FINALLY, we made it back to the car and headed back home. Seth was a little depressed because he knew he had to go back to Cornelia, Georgia, where there are nothing but stupid, close-minded rednecks. But we had some Mexican food and watched Love Potion #9 (which Seth had never seen) and things were good. We had a good laugh at all the pictures that I had taken and then I was sad cause he had to go. And I finally caught up with the adventures of Luke and Cindy. I feel sad now cause I'm not with them enjoying all the fun. Hopefully, they'll be glad to see me when I come up and we'll have a blast together. Okay, so I've rambled for long enough. Must shower and prepare for an early doctor's appointment tomorrow. Hopefully, he won't tell me that I'm dying.

      Okay, so I really meant to go to bed early on Thursday. However, I started cleaning and then called Seth and we talked for an hour. We haven't spoken in forever. . . a lot of meaningless crap has happened since we last spoke. I finally go to bed at midnight and I'm up at 7 to get ready for work. Work is good. At the very end of the day, my boss informs me that he wants us to have more e-mail-a-thons on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. So of course I volunteer to work 12 to 12 on all three of those days. Also, one of our clients has 400 e-mails that are older than we need them to be. And the bigwigs wants us to have them done by Monday (yes all of them). And he said that we're up for contract negotiations with them pretty soon and this is not the time to fall behind. Problem? Ha! I thrive on this kind of pressure. And it's nice to work on something besides Chick-fil-A. I work till 9:30, I'm home at 10:30, in bed after 11, and up at 5 for work. Oh, and somewhere in between, I run into the biggest mistake of my 24 years. Oy, what the hell was I thinking? I am way too tired to deal with him. And Saturday, I leave for work before the sun comes up and I am the first to arrive. At least it'll be a normal day though. No overtime today.  &nbsp;  The day goes by quickly enough and I get to leave at 3:00. YAY! And Seth gets to my place around 4:15. YAY Again!! We head down to the Mall of Georgia (yes, that's the mall's actual name) and get some very fattening spicy chicken at this Cajun place in the food court. We then head to the Mall's movie theatre and see "I, Robot." Fabulous movie, by the way. It was very intense and you got to see Will Smith's butt. It was also a little disturbing, but all in all, it was a great use for my money. Then, we went shopping to my favorite store in the universe, Charlotte Russe. Could the shorts get any shorter?? Seriously, who has the body for that crap. Seth and I had a great time trying to figure out what items were tops and which were bottoms. . . sometimes it was a little tough to figure that out. But I did find a great dress and a great top to wear to work. I also found a cute new purse. And I had a $100  gift  card that I had gotten for Christmas, so I didn't pay for any of it. We then leave the store and head to Cinnabon for a fattening snack. For those of you who are unaware, Cinnabon is found in malls and sirports and there desserts are so bad that they don't post the nutritional information on their website. However, because my company also does customer service for them, I do have access to that information. Because of that, I get the low-fat strawberry minibon (probably has a million grams of sugar). I had never tried one before and I never should have. . . it was  soooo  good. I also had a bite of the really fattening one that Seth got, which probably contained about 300 calories (seriously). Then Seth and I head to Barnes and Noble for some book browsing, one of our favorite pastimes. We spend about an hour and a half in there. I decide to buy an Idiot's Guide to Investing. My company has an investment plan and I might as well take advantage of it while I'm still there (seriously, I do  not  want to be there for much longer).&nbsp; And can you imagine it. . . me buying stock? I am  such  a grownup! I also bought Michael Moore's latest masterpiece, "Dude, where's my country?" I read the introduction and I'm already hooked! I love him so much. Hmm. . . maybe this would be a great birthday present for my father. Hehe. And now the sugar from my minibon has caught up with me. Migraine time. Since I went on my health kick, I'm not used to eating that much sugar at a time. Fat maybe. . . sugar no. We head back to my place and I get Seth to finish pumping air in my balance ball cause it was a little too mushy. We watch some Mad TV, I lay down, and I pretty much pass out.  &nbsp;  The best part of the ENTIRE day?? I do NOT move for 8 and 1/2 hours! Woo-hoo! I feel wonderful!! While I'm waiting for Seth to awaken, I watch Jessica get laser eye surgery on Newlyweds (so weird) and then I watch about 4 episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210. It's so weird to see Jason Priestley circa 1993. How old were they back then? 30?? Seth finally awakens at 11:30, we eat and get ready to head to his  car  thing. We get there and it's pretty awesome. Seth gets to drive a BMW, a Subaru, and a Volvo on 3 different courses. And the object is pretty much to go as fast as you can. My God, Seth knows how to do that. We were actually riding on 3 tires a couple times. Actually, I think we were riding on 2 at one point. It was awesome though. I didn't really want to drive, even though I could have. Like Seth said, "Cindy likes riding." Hehe. After that, we decide to go eat Mexican. The host and waiter are so hot and we are distracted. Then we come home and it's time for Seth to leave. Damn. I watch some TV. I also have this "10-minute Clutter Control" book. I'm attempting to Feng Shui my life. And apparently, I learned that clutter on your nightstand can confuse your love life and disturb your sleep. Hmmm. . . so  that's  why I'm alone and tired. I did manage to de-clutter my desk and my nightstand. We'll work on the rest later. Whatever, like anything's going to change. Right now, I need a massage. I have this huge knot right under my shoulder blades that's been building for about a week. It's very painful. I'm also very sleepy. I may go to bed now. Don't expect a blog from me anytime soon. . . I'm working 12 to 12 for the next 3 days, so I'll be unavailable. Check in on me to make sure I'm still alive!

      Today was just another day of work, work, work. I was up at 7 am to fight traffic yet again. Oh well. . . gives me time to think. I get to work and get started. So many e-mails, so little time. I know I've said it before. . . but I am  sooo  over this week. There is this cute new guy, but I am totally over him. He's hot, but he's got strikes against him. &nbsp; Strike#1 -- He's Georgian. Strike#2 -- He's super religious. Strike #3 -- He's 20 years old. (Dos might like 'em young, but I don't. . . at least, not anymore) Strike #4 -- His name is Jason. (I don't do "J" names. . . at least, not anymore) &nbsp; He is hot, though, and he can sing. Oh well. I'm not having it. I've been working too hard. The day passed rather uneventfully. I did a ton of e-mails (like I always do). I also got pissed off at my coworker, Wendy. Apparently, it's unfair to start giving prizes to the most productive people. Whatever, she's just pissed that she'll never, ever get one.&nbsp; We all also discuseed the possibility of another e-mail-a-thon. They say they've barely recovered from the last one.  &nbsp; Me: I am totally up for another e-mail-a-thon. Dwight: Yeah, but you're on something. I want whatever you're taking before the next one. Me: Don't worry, I'll hook you up. I'll have my guy call your guy. &nbsp; I was planning on working till 9 tonight. However, I felt like a migraine might be coming on, so I left at 7, my usual time. Leaving while it's still daylight. . . what a concept. And I've felt this migraine coming on for the last 2 weeks. I wish it would just get here, debilitate me, and leave me alone. I fought traffic, came home, finished off the turkey chili, watched TV, and did the dishes. Now I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted and I need a good nine hours of sleep.

      So yesterday, I get up to face a day of work after my relaxing weekend (first one in a long time). It turns out that my supervisor DID need me to come in on Monday. She said that she meant to call me about 15 million times, but she was mad busy. I guess I should have called her back, but I enjoyed my day off. I wasn't planning on working overtime last night, but they just needed me so bad. So I worked 11 to 9. It was very quiet at work today.   Me: "I am soooo over this week." Dwight: "What?? It just started. . . this is like Monday for you."  Blah, blah, blah. Everyone's testy because of the millions of e-mails that we have. I'm so tired of work. Thats all I do. And I volunteered to work 11 hours three days in a row this week. But Seth is coming over this weekend and we'll go shopping and to the movies and to his car thing. I'm so proud of him. He finally found a place to put his car business, so he'll be able to apply for a dealership license soon. I haven't seen him in weeks. I can't wait.   So today, I'm up at 5 am so that I can be at work by 8. The moon is still out when I leave. I am so not used to that. And I hear on the radio that the temperature will be 95 degrees today, but it will feel like 110. Ugh. Georgia weather sucks. I don't care what season it is. Traffic makes me mad. I hate people with the passion of a thousand suns. It is nice actually getting a parking space right by the door. Score! I actually get work done today, which is nice. I'm actually caught up. The rest of the company is another question. I get to send out an e-mail telling my coworkers what e-mails to do since I'm the first one there. Aaah. . . I feel so important. My boss sends out an e-mail saying that we need all the help we can get, so feel free to volunteer for overtime. She also said that one of the bigwigs wants us to organize another e-mail-a-thon to get e-mails done. Oh joy. We've barely recovered from the last one. Of course, what the hell am I thinking?? I work 11 hours a day with no sweat anyway. What's an extra hour?? So I volunteered to work like 60 hours next week. And I told my boss that I would be up for another e-mail-a-thon. I also reminded her that I would be UNAVAILABLE the weekend of the 30th. Thank God I'll get out of here. I need a break. . . badly. I work, work, work some more. I had planned to go shopping after work at 7. However, I was too damn tired so I went home. And of course it starts raining and traffic is a nightmare. I get home, eat some turkey chili, and watch "Quintuplets." (funny show) Then I worked out to Denise Austin for an hour and I feel great. Then I watched Will and Grace and now it's time for bed. I'm up at 7 and I'm tired. But then again, I'm always tired.

      Today was beautiful. My supervisor never called me back, which meant she either didn't need me today or they wouldn't approve the overtime. Either way, it meant that I got to enjoy a second day off. . . so I had an actual weekend! That has not happened in a long time. So I lounged around in my pajamas for several hours. I made a pot of turkey chili to take to work for lunch this week. I think it came out okay. I can never get it just right though. Oh well, practice makes perfect. I also tried a Slim Fast Potato soup, which I didn't like very much. Too powdery or something. I think I'll stick with Campbell's. It's got less calories anyway. I also watched an old Dallas rerun. I saw the one where Pam realized Bobby's death (and the whole previous season) was all a dream. Yeah. . . stupidest storyline in TV history. I also had some Healthy Choice Rocky Road (yum yum!) and watched a Buffy rerun. Then, I worked out for an hour. I did Denise Austin cardio and then Denise Austin's "Shrink your female fat zones." It was an intense workout. Right now my arms are sore from the weight exercises. I also used the balance ball for the first time with Denise Austin's workout. It was interesting. And by interesting, I mean hilarious cause I had to work so hard to keep my balance. So glad I was by myself. It really worked my abs though. I can feel that too. This was my first real workout since I hurt my knee. I had forgotten how good I feel afterwards. Then, I finished cleaning, vacuuming, and laundry that I hadn't had a chance to finish yesterday. I also bought the tickets for Seth and I to go see "Chicago." Yay!! I can't wait. For dinner, I had another Slim Fast meal. This one was Fettucine Alfredo. Not as good as the real thing, but it's okay. Not bad, actually. I watched some Seinfeld, some Friends, and so much Lifetime TV it's a little pathetic. I also worked out again. I did the Bellydancing thing. I was able to get through the whole workout this time. The 3 minutes just flew by. Tough moves though. And now I'm finishing up the Lifetime "Movie of the Month" and Will and Grace at the same time. I'm also hungry. And I have to force myself not to eat. Eating at night is bad. I've been a little slack the past couple of weeks and I want to maintain my weight. Actually, I want to lose more. So no food after 9:00. Besides, I know that my entire weekend at Rochester, I'll be eating late and eating good things that are bad for me. So I have to prepare. I can't wait though. I can almost taste the Golden Port now. Mmmmm. . . so hungry. I wish they delivered to Georgia. And even though they have Taco Bell, Denny's, and McDonald's down here, it'll still be great to go to those places with Dos and Luke again. Now, I'm reminiscing. Good times, good times. Hmm. . . maybe I miss the food more than them. Hehe. I jest. Have to go now. It will be bedtime soon and tomorrow is all about Chick-fil-A e-mails.

      This weekend started off rocky. On Saturday, I was supposed to wake up at 6:30 and instead I woke up at 7:55. And considering the fact that I just got 9 1/2 hours sleep, I feel remarkably unrested. Of course, I managed to shower, dry my hair, and get dressed in half an hour. How good am I? I get to work with 10 minutes to spare. I came in at 10:00 to work an hour of overtime, so I really didn't need to rush to get here. But I'm a total work horse. At least, that's what they tell me at work. I worked 10 to 9 on Saturday. It really paid off too, cause when I left, Chick-fil-A had only 327 e-mails. Woo-hoo!! Stupidest w-mail of the day: white guy who was discriminated against. Ha. What a loser. The day was long and brutal, so I decided to treat myself and pick up Mexican food on the way home. Mmmm. . . I love their cheese dip. When I got home, I fully intended to get stuff done. I had cleaning to do, laundry, balancing my checkbook, blah, blah, blah. But I was way too tired. So I pigged out on Mexican food and watched mindless Lifetime TV programming. And I didn't do a damn thing. I went to bed around 2:00 and slept till 9:30. I woke up, watched TV, had leftover Mexican food for lunch, and I did manage to do some cleaning. I took my time about it though. I did the dishes, my laundry, vacuumed, etc. I also called my supervisor and left her a message. I told her that if they needed me to come in on Monday, I would, even though it's supposed to be my day off. I am such a glutton for punishment. Whatever, I'll be grateful for it when I get my paycheck. That night, I decided to do a little exercise. I put in my new Bellydancing fitness DVD. I wasn't able to get through the entire thing. It's more of a grueling workout than you would think. It's fun though. And then I did my Kathy Smith weight lifting DVD. Now that's a workout. I need more muscle though. I also blew up my balance ball. It took forever! But now I have a new toy for my home gym. My mom and my sister also came over for a few minutes. Jenifer had to drop off some money for Dad amd mom wanted the grand tour of my apartment cause she's never seen it. She really aggravates me. She's such a bad mother. Whatever, I'll be civil. Jenifer told me that she's found a house and will probably be moved in by August. Oh, joy. It's bad enough that my sister will be only 15 minutes away, but my mother will be too. Of course, I did like seeing Jenifer just because she's gotten bigger. For the first time ever, I am smaller than my sister. I think it's funny that I'm getting smaller and she's getting bigger. Luckily, her and my mom didn't stay very long. Then, I wacthed the Simpsons and caught up on my e-mails. And then it hit me. . . the stupid migraine that I've felt coming on for the last week. It came on fast too. One minute I'm fine and the next minute, I can barely move. So I went to bed at 9:00 pm. I woke up at 6:30 this morning, so I got a pretty decent night's sleep. I still feel wiped out though. No matter how much sleep I get, I still feel tired. I need a vacation. So now I'm watching Golden Girls and I plan on balancing my check book since I didn't get to that yesterday. I also have some more cleaning to do and laundry to finish. I also plan on buying tickets for Seth and me to see the musical, Chicago. His birthday is in September and it's coming to Atlanta in early October. Since we both loved the movie so much, I think we'll enjoy the musical too. I hope so anyway. Gotta go now.

      These past two days have been exhausting and hectic, so excuse me for not keeping up with my blog. Wednesday and Thursday, I worked 12 to 12 for our "E-mail-a-thon." Every one of the clients that we handle had major, major e-mail volume and several of us volunteered to work 12 hours to try to get them done. And we all took a 2 hour break to watch dinner and a movie on those nights (paid for by our manager). Wednesday's movie was "Office Space" and last night's movie was "Fifty First Dates." Both of those are very excellent movies. And on Wednesday, one minute before our shift was over, Dwight kindly reminded me that we had been there exactly one year. Oh my god.   Dwight: Today's the 7th right? You know what that means. . . we've been working here for          exactly one year.  Me: Really?? Gee, I don't know whether to congratulate myself or throw myself off a cliff.     What do you think Dwight? You wanna push me off a cliff later?  Dwight: Hmmm. . . as tempting as that is, that'll just mean more work for me tomorrow, so          no thanks.  Isn't Dwight awesome? But Rachelle sang "Happy Aniversary" to us (sung to the tune of "Happy Birthday") That was sweet and she has an awesome voice too. Thursday's e-mail-a-thon went pretty much like Wednesday's Of course I ate junk food for dinner both nights. I better be careful. I don't want to gain back the weight that I've lost. Wednesday and Thursday actually ended with all of us listening to Loveline on the radio while we worked. Good times. That took me back to the days when I worked my stupid 4 to midnight shift. And of course Dwight was rubbing it in everyone's face that he had Friday off and we all had to work. Of course, I switched to a later shift. I really didn't want to get home at one and then be back at work at 11 the next day. So I decided to switch to the 1 to 9 shift. I have the ability to sleep till 10:30 today, but do I?? HA! I wake up at 8:45 and I think I overslept. Then, I can't go back to sleep. That's okay, though. I watched some Golden Girls and Nanny and relaxed before work. It was nice not having to rush to get ready. It's so hot out today. The high is 92 degrees. Of course, it starts raining later. . . . because that's what it does. It rains super hard for fifteen minutes and then it's clear again. The day passes rather uneventfully. I am so happy because Chick-fil-A now only has 435 e-mails! Woo-hoo! We are finally making a dent in these things. Our Project Manager is panicking because the big head honchos from Chick-fil-A are coming on Tuesday and lord knows, we can't have all those e-mails in there. Ugh. I hate it when they come. . . I can never get enough work done. Anyway, the night ended with a bitchy, stupid man who claims that previous operators hung up on him. Whatever. He's rude and irritating and demands a supervisor, yet he won't let me put him on hold to get one. He didn't think I was being apologetic enough and he got pissed that I did apologize. After 25 minutes of this, he finally lets me put him on hold and then he hangs up after 30 seconds before I can get anyone. Good riddance. Well, I handled it well. I totally kept my cool and was extremely patient with him. Anyone else would have hung up on long before that. Thank God my shift is over fifteen minutes after I finish dealing with him. I can't do anything else for the rest of the night. Now I'm exhausted and I actually volunteered to work an 11 hour shift tomorrow to help make some more headway with the e-mails. What the hell was I thinking?

      Saturday. . .  Okay, this was a long and crazy weekend and I'll try to catch everyone up with it. On Saturday, I'm up at 5 am to head off to work. Oy, so exhausting. The day goes by fast though. Of course, the day wouldn't be complete without an idot customer on the phone. First, he calls me "honey" and "baby." What the hell is that about? I don't even know this guy. He's complaining about Chick-fil-A and he keeps talking about how much money he spends and how he spends $200 a week at Applebee's. Okay, Applebee's isn't even that good! And I'll I'm thinking is: please go to Applebee's and stop bothering me!! I maintain my calm though and 30 minutes later, he's off my line. The rest of the day passes rather uneventfully and I'm off to my grandmother's. I walk in the door and I get the greatest greeting from my grandmother. She says, "My God, look how little you've gotten!" And my sister comments about how my butt is smaller. Excellent. And then the conversation inevitably returns to my sister and her baby. We begin to talk about the fact that my cousin is getting married because his girlfriend is pregnant. Apparently, Jenifer (my sister) believes that my cousin's girlfriend got pregnant simply to take the spotlight away from Jenifer. She doesn't even want to go to the wedding because no one will be focused on her. Can you say, "self-involved"?? Anyway, Jenifer, Dad, and I go out to dinner and the conversation turns to politics. It's so interesting to discuss politics with a Republican. They don't really care about anyone but themselves. Oh well. We do agree that we are perfectly okay with the legalization of drugs and prostitution. Yay. Then, we're back to my grandmother's, where we watch Office Space (fabulous movie). Of course, I get a terrible migraine in the middle of it and by the time it's over, I'm ready for bed.   Sunday. . .  YES!! 8 hours of uniterrupted sleep and I don't have to work today!! How happy am I?? We all get up and head off to breakfast at McDonald's and then we're going to Sam's Club so I get a membership. Apparently, the DVD box sets are so much cheaper there. So I get my membership and also a couple of new workout DVD's, including one on Bellydancing. Yay for me. Then we're off to my dad's for a 4th of July cookout. We get there at 11:30 and they are no where near ready to begin cooking, even though we were told that we would eat at 12. My sister is seriously bummed because she wanted to go to my uncle's pool and we probably won't get there until late. And Jenifer is so immature she keeps blabbing about how much she wants to go work on her tan. My God, get over it!! My grandmother starts feeling ill because she is still getting over the flu and we all leave early. This makes Jenifer extraordinarily happy. Of course, on the way home, it begins raining. . . for the millionth day in a row. This makes Jenifer unhappy. We go inside to wait out the rain and Jenifer and my grandmother begin gossiping about Sheila, my dad's bitchy girlfriend. This goes on for way too long and I get sick of it. So I ask them nicely if we can talk about something else. And of course, my pregnant, hormonal sister blows up and accuses me of trying to change her, acting like I'm better than everyone else, being selfish, blah, blah, blah. Basically, she's accusing me of being just like her. So she does her spiled brat thing, threatens to go home (please do), and then eventually the sun comes back out and all is forgiven because Jenifer wants to enjoy the sun. We go to the pool, where Jenifer begins joking about how she was unconscious when she got pregnant. And my cousin's friends are there and she's never even met these guys. But she says that she doesn't care about what people think of her. Well obviously. We swim, there's rain, we leave, my Dad and Sheila come to bring us food. We talk, go swim some more, come back, and get into a major fight. Sheils acts like a bitch to Jenifer, my dad starts screaming at her (I swear she'll drive him to another heart attack), she insults Jenifer, my grandmother throws her out and threatens to call the police if she doesn't leave. Drama, drama. Sheils is so drunk she's falling down. I hate drunks. Eventually, we get her to shut her up and my dad takes her home. I really wish he would throw her out on her bony ass. We then head back to my uncle's for fireworks, late night swimming, horseshoes, and alcohol. . . lots and lots of alcohol. Woo-hoo. Good times, good times and my migraine is back so it is off to bed.  Monday. . . Another 8 hours of sleep makes me happy. My grandmother starts the day by cooking us an extremely fattening breakfast. Yeah, she spends years telling me how fat I am and now she wants to make me gain back the weight that I've lost. And it's a gorgeous day so we head off to the pool to get some sun. We spend a lot of time playing in the pall and hitting each other with water balls. And I actually doze off in my chair for a few minutes. Luckily, I have remembered the cardinal rule of applying sunscreen and then reapplying at frequent intervals. The day ends with me getting a little color but not getting burned. Score! We head back to my grandmother's for some food and dry clothes. Then, my dad and mom come to get Jenifer so that they can take mom to see the house Jenifer wants to get (which is just 15 minutes away from me). Jenifer is finally gone!! It is so much quieter without her here. I know I can get loud sometimes, but she screams when she talks. Not to mention the fact that she speaks in one long, continuos sentence. My grandmother and I watch Dr. Phil (I love him) and then head to my uncle's (yet again) for a cookout. My uncle swims and the rest of us talk and catch up. One of my aunts gets drunk off margaritas and is so funny. I throw my grandmother in the pool while she is throwing water balls at my uncle. She's not too mad though and everyone is amused. I then play a game of Scrabble with my drunk aunt, her husband, and my grandmother. Guess who wins by more than sixty points?? Yep, that would be me. We eat a nice dinner of chicken and grilled potatoes and we laugh and have a great time. We then set off even more fireworks and the day has been a good one. It's then back to my grandmother's for TV and bed. Tomorrow it's back to work. Joy of joys.   Tuesday. . .  9 hours of sleep and I am ready for a day of e-mails and bitchy customers. I shower and take off for work. Traffic is great, which makes me happy. Work is good. It goes by fast, and we're making a little headway with the e-mails. Thank goodness. I work , work,  work and head home on time for a change. I come home, watch TV, check e-mails, and spend forever catching everyone up on my blog. I must prepare for tomorrow's e-mail-a-thon (working 12 to 12). I plan on working out for the first time since the dislocation of my knee. We'll see how that goes. Talk to everyone later.

      Wednesday. . .   Okay, so today was my first day back at the office in 4 days. Ugh. I was not looking forward to that. Since I had worked close to 60 hours last week AND the week before, I desperately needed the time away. So I come in and Chick-fil-A now has 674 e-mails. Argh!! It was at 550 when I left. . . what has everyone been doing?!? I'm just so glad I don't answer e-mails from Sonic since they have over 2,000 e-mails. I actually felt guilty about eating there this weekend, just knowing how swamped they have made us. (Note to self: if Luke ever comes back to Georgia, introduce him to the fattening world of Sonic.) Anyway, so many e-mails, so little time. I would stop eating at CFA cause I'm so sick of all this work. However, they have the best chicken in the world. Of course, you Rochesterians have no idea what I'm talking about (except maybe Luke, of course). My supervisor was thrilled when I volunteered to work overtime tonight and tomorrow. I am the only one who works OT anymore, but hey, at $21/hour, it is  sooo  worth it. So the day goes by fast and I don't have too many stupid people on the phone. And it rained today again. Dreary weather and I'm tired, even though I got 9 1/2 hours of sleep last night. And I'm here from 10:30 to 9:00 pm. I then talk to my sister on the way home and she is pretty much moving down here to be closer to all of us. And you know what that means? Yep, my mom is coming with. Oh Joy. Oh well, I'll just avoid her. My sister is also talking about getting a job with me. We'll see if that works out or not. At least that will mean plenty of quality time with my niece or nephew. Let's hope the kid grows up just like me and nothing like her mother, right? So then I arrive home at 10:00 pm, only to discover that the Internet is down AGAIN! My dad tells me that something is wrong with the line and the Internet people are supposed to come tomorrow to check it out. I hope they do it soon. Oh, and I discovered that I've lost my debit card. Dammit! So I'll call the bank tomorrow. For now, it's Will and Grace, Golden Girls, and sweet, sweet sleep.  Thursday. . .   Wake up today to a doctor's appointment. . . FINALLY!! And joy of joys, when they weighed me, they discovered that I have lost weight. How is that even possible?? Must have been that 5 mile hike through downtown Atlanta on Sunday. Oh well, 17 more pounds till I reach my goal weight. Yippee. The doctor (who is so hot. . . looks like Luke Wilson) says MRI looked good (which means no bone chips or cartilage floating around in my knee and nothing is torn). There is still a lot of puffiness and some "abnormal motions" happening when I move my knee, but it doesn't look like I'll need surgery. I still have to wear the brace for a month (eek) and then I'll probably have to do physical therapy to strengthen my leg. But he did say I could resume treadmill and Taebo (yay!). I just have to go easy and wear my brace. Oh, how I've missed cardio. Sounds weird considering I went three years with no regular exercise, right? So I make my follow up appointment for August (day after I return from Rochester actually) and head to Target since I don't have to be at work till 12 today. Okay, so I only go in for like 3 items and I end up spending way tooo much money on stuff I didn't even go in there for! How did that happen? Oh well, I can afford it. No biggie. And then I'm off to Chick-fil-A for lunch (I loved their Chargrilled Chicken Sandwich with Buffalo Sauce on it. . . you know me and spicy!) and then it's off to work for a 10 hour shift today. And of course it's raining. . . for the ninth straight day in a row, I kid you not. But we were in a drought, so I guess we needed it. And I get to work and discover that I was not given croutons for my side salad (okay, so I never eat them. . . it's the principle of the thing. And my lettuce is brown and my chicken looks like it has a tail! Weird. But it's still tasty and I put some Buffalo sauce on it and I am good to go. Yummy. And now I'm catching up on my blog on my lunch break since I have no Internet at home. We have been so busy that this is the FIRST day in 2 weeks that I have not had to work straight through lunch. I feel lost cause I can't catch up on Luke's blog and I have no idea what anyone is doing. It suddenly occurs to me that it's been exactly 6 weeks since I last spoke to Kim. Actually, I've been thinking about it every day. She's my best friend, but ever since our fight 6 weeks ago, we have yet to speak. Well, I didn't do anything wrong and if she's not concerned with losing her best friend, then what can I do? It's just sad. I realized the other day that Seth and I have been best friends for exactly 4 years and Kim and I have been friends for the same length of time. It's amazing how time flies. I guess there's nothing I can do about Kim. . . if she wants to lose me over this stupid fight, then that's her deal. Okay, 12 more minutes for my lunch break and I'm going to balance my checkbook. I'll check back with everyone later.

      Okay, I know it's been a while since my last blog, but it has been a hectic few days. On Friday, I went to work and it was fairly uneventful. I still hadn't heard from Kim and I was getting a little worried. But on the way home, she called me. It turns out that she thought she had e-mailed me and she has spent the past two days waiting for me to e-mail her. That's funny. I was on my way home from work and since I had not reached her exit yet, she asked if I wanted to come over to her place and talk. When I got there, Dave (asshole boyfriend) was there, so we didn't really get a chance to talk. Instead, we caught up, ate dinner, and I played with the kids. It's amazing how fast kids can grow in 3 months! They're also the cutest kids in the world. Anyway, Kim had to go to Wal-Mart to get some things, so we left the kids with Dave so that we could go and talk. I'm not really sure if she understands that she did anything wrong, but she said she would try to watch the fighting with Dave thing and try not to do it in front of me. That's all I ask, I guess. We spent a little time at Wal-Mart and then we went back to her place. Since it was close to 10:30 at that time, I went home. I ended up not going to bed until after 1:30.  On Saturday, I got up bright and early to go to work. I got a lot of work done and it was kind of slow. After work, I had to go to Wal-Mart to get some things. I was starving, so I ended up spending a lot more money than I intended. Oy. Then I went home, ate, and watched LIfetime TV. I chatted with Luke a little and also I heard my dad and his girlfriend get into a huge fight. They were yelling like crazy and she was crying. She was probably drunk and had pulled some stupid stunt. He finally left around 2 am. God, I hate this crap. I finally went to bed around 2:30.  On Sunday, I woke up and got ready to go over to Kim's Her friend was having a baby shower so we had plans to go to that and then go to the American Idol concert. I went to Kim's place and waited for her to get ready. Of course, she was running late. Hehe. Finally, we left and went to her friend's baby shower. I had only met her friend a couple of times, but she's nice and we had fun. Kim and I helped decorate beforehand. We ate lunch and played a few baby shower games (which I lost, of course). We left in plenty of time to get to the concert. Of course, we spent 15 minutes looking for parking. One parking lot wants $20 for parking! As if! We finally found a parking lot that only wanted $8 and it was only a couple blocks away from the arena. The concert was totally awesome! Everyone (even John Stevens, who I normally hate) was awesome. Thay all had so much energy. The concert was totally sold out. Of course, I'm in Diana's home town, so that's normal. We had really good seats on the floor, so we were able to see the stage really well. The concert lasted about 3 hours and then we fought thousands of people to find the exit and our way to the car. Our ears were both ringing from the noise and our throats were sore from all the yelling. And it was raining. Joy. Luckily, we weren't parked that far away and it was only drizzling, so it wasn't so bad. Kim and I were hungry after that so we went to Krystal's for a late-night snack on our meager budget. We got home after 11 and ate our dinner. Dave was watching Schindler's List (which we had never seen), so we watched part of that. We watched the first half and then we went to bed cause it was really late and we were exhausted.  Adrian woke me up a couple of times in the middle of the night screaming bloody murder. Man, I have no idea how Kim puts up with it all the time. I woke up for a good about 8:30, a few minutes before Dave left for work. Kim woke up soon after, as did the boys. We pretty much spent the rest of the day hanging out and doing nothing. Of course, we did watch, Barney, Elmo's World, Sesame Street, and other quality PBS programming. I played with the boys a lot. I gave each of them so much attention, it was crazy. Christian was so sweet. He just sat in my lap while he watched TV. I swear, if I didn't know how hard kids were, I'd want to have one right now. But I think I can wait a few more years. . . at least. Dave got home from work that night and we decided to move a lot of stuff over to their apartment that they will soon be moving into. They had picked up the keys already, but they have till the end of the month to be out of their current apartment. They loaded stuff into my car and theirs. We get there and Kim and I start a concersation with some hot guy living in the same complex. Of course, the guy has a girlfriend. Dave got pissed and began bitching at Kim. And once again, they have a screaming match. Great. She really never learns. After an hour of this, we leave him to go back to her place. She called me on my cell on the way back and said that she would understand if I never wanted to speak to her again. It would be really easy, but I can't do that. She did say that she has a temper and that's not going to change and I'm just going to have to accept it. Great. I tried to explain to her that she should be more worried about what she's doing to her children than me, but I don't think she got it. Anyway, I'm just tired of thinking about it. I left her place around 9:15 and headed home to my cozy bed. I was just hoping that my dad and his girlfriend weren't going at it again. Jesus, everywhere I look, I practically trip over a dysfunctional relationship. Is it any wonder that I'm still single?? I unpacked a little and cleaned and then went to bed.  Today, I woke up a little groggy. I felt like I hadn't slept very well. I headed off to work and all day, I felt a little off. . . kind of migrainey (yeah, sure that's a word). And Dwight was kind enough to remind me that my midyear review thing crap is due tomorrow. Yikes! I haven't even started. Oh well. I looked over it and realized it wouldn't take that long to do. He also asked me where my trashy romances were. He said it was weird that I got political all of a sudden and that I acted like I was too good for them. Ha! As if I would ever be too good for trashy romance novels. I left work at 7:00 on the dot and headed home. Traffic was good. I got home, had a nice dinner of cocktail shrimp and crackers. Then I spent forever catching you people up on my life. I don't even know how many people read this, but feel free to comment and drop me a line. I'm tired now and I have lots to do before bed.

      These past three days have been very blah. On Tuesday, I did. . . stuff. . . I just don't remember what. I know that work was involved. And eating and sleeping. I know that I finally balanced my checkbook and that I have more money than I thought I did. Yay. I also e-mailed Kim to tell her that we should end our fight already. Then, I slept.  Wednesday. . . I woke up, went to work. Work was busy, but uneventful. I came home and made myself a dinner of spaghetti with whole wheat pasta. And I made the sauce from scratch, thank you very much. Okay, so I took some plain Hunt's tomato sauce and added my own spices. Whatever, same thing. It was yummy, too. Then I chatted with Luke a little. He's awesome. He may come see me in October. Double yay. I hope he brings Laura with him. It's nice to show people that Georgia isn't a complete hellhole. The more people that know, the faster word will spread throughout the country. And Independence Air flies from Washington to Atlanta for only $59 each way. Hint, hint Laura. :) Then I did various things on my computer (no dirty stuff, I promise). Then I chatted with Dos. I told her that I could come visit her in LA for her winter break. I can hardly wait. I need another vacation. . . desperately. I'm looking forward to all the food. Hehe. . . figures. Then I got totally pissed off (not at Dos). Okay. . . question. Do I have the word "slut" tattood on my forehead?? Or can you just tell it by speaking to me?? This online guy (who I've never met and have only spoken to a handful of times) is coming to GA from CA in September for five days and he wants to "meet" me. And I'm pretty sure he doesn't just want to hang out. What makes him think that? And here's a tip: if you've never even met a woman, don't call her "baby." God, that pisses me off. I can't even tell him off. I don't have the guts. Yech. I am so sick of straight men I could throw up a little.  Oh yeah. . . still no word from Kim.  Thursday. . . I am such an idiot. In my pissed off state last night, I set the alarm for SEVEN instead of eight! Argh! The alarm goes off and I'm like, what the hell?? I do manage to fall asleep again for about 15 minutes. I didn't even go to bed till after 1:30. The day pretty much goes downhill from there. I get stuck in traffic because idiots feel like slowing down to stare at an accident. Oy. Customers piss me off at work, managers piss me off, and the computer pisses me off. Notice a trend? My computer system actually went down for well over an hour. So I'm pissed off and tired as well. All of these factors made for a very unproductive day. I spent time thinking about the winter trip to LA. I know that it's early, but I realized that if I didn't ask for vacation time soon, I might not be able to go. December is a crazy time and everyone will be wanting to go out of town. Hopefully, Dos will let me know when her break is soon. Hint, hint Dos. Hehe. I love her, but she's a last minute kind of girl. Seth called me at work. We chatted for a while. We decided that if Kim didn't call me by Saturday, then we would plan on him going to the concert with me. Good cause I spent $100 on those tickets. . . certainly don't want them to go to waste.  Work finally ended. I came home and made myself some leftover spaghetti and salad for dinner. Then I just worked on the computer and watched TV. I'm going to make myself get up early and work out. We'll see how that goes. Now, I'm going to watch Friends and Just Shoot Me before bed. Hey, it's not much, but it's all I've got.  Oh yeah. . . still no word from Kim.

      Okay, so I'm a lousy blog updater. Bite me. :) Saturday started off with a trip to Target for a birthday present for my sister. Of course, I spent way too much money, which is usually whasent happens at Target. I bought my sister's present (Friends DVD box set) and several other odds and ends, like a photo album, hammer, nails, etc. Weird combo, I know. Then I hurried to work and it was kind of slow. This allowed me to catch up on so much work that I was behind on. And except for the fact that the computer system went down twice (argh), it was a pretty decent day. I left work at 10:00 and got stuck in a little traffic due to an accident. When I finally got home, I had a snack, watched some TV, and wrapped my sister's present. I went to bed around 2:00 and woke up at 9:00. I took a shower and Jenifer (my sister) arrived a little after 10. My family decided to have a birthday cookout at my uncle's pool. My sister and I went to the pool and my dad went to get the food to be grilled. Jenifer and I were the first to arrive and we just hung out talking. Eventually more people showed up and got in the pool. I mingled. Seriously, my family pisses me off sometimes. We ate dinner, had cake, opened presents. At around 5:15, I left to go see Seth. Yay! On the way, a rock attacked my car. Yes. . . a rock. I was driving along the interstate, singing along to Billy Joel, when all of a sudden. . . . a rock comes out of the air and hits my windshield. It cracked it pretty good, too. It was almost as if someone had thrown it at my car. It happened just as I was passing under a bridge. But I didn't see anyone and I was scared. I had no idea what to do. Craziness. I made it to Seth's and stood outside banging on his door for a good ten minutes because Seth was in the shower and didn't hear me. He did greet me at the door wearing nothing but a towel. Hehe. We left his place and he took me to the space where he'll have his business. The office is small, but it's a good space. He'll have tons of space to keep his cars. Then we left to go eat dinner and see a movie. I did tell him what my family said about him and me. He thought it was funny. He said that next time he sees my family, he's going to flirt with me and he'll flirt with every single one of them individually. He wants to confuse the hell out of them. Oh man, Seth is awesome. We ate dinner at Sonic and then we went to see Manchurian Candidate. Neither Seth nor myself liked the movie very much. It was boring at times, very long, and ended weird. Oh well. . . it's a good thing Seth was the one who paid for the movie. :) We didn't get back to his place till 12:30. Seth and I were sad about leaving each other, so I invited him back to my place. His mom needed the car, so I said we could go in my car and I would take him home the next night since I was off on Mondays. I went inside with him to get his stuff and I chatted with his mom for a while. She's awesome and she loves me. Hehe. It's funny because I still call her "Dr." Daigle, even though she's not my professor anymore. I can't believe that Seth and I have known each other for 4 years. I met him when he came with his mother on a class trip that Kim and I were a part of. How could she have known that Seth and I would become best friends? It's funny how things turn out. So Seth and I finally leave his place around 1:00 am, so we don't get home until 2:30. We're both tired, but we got kind of interested in Eyes Wide Shut, which we had never seen. The parts we saw were interesting, but it wasn't supposed to go off until 4:30 and both of us fell asleep before the end. It was also boiling in my room because my thermostat is broken or something. I actually woke up at 9:30 (only 6 hours of sleep) and I watched TV and killed time until Seth woke up at 11:30. We had lunch, watched Roseanne and Runaway Bride (which he had never seen(, and just had fun. Then he took a shower and we got ready to go. We had to go to Wal-Mart to get a photo album (I was not happy with the one I got at Target) and some Raid because I seem to have an ant problem. I think they're coming from the garage. I don't even have any food laying out. Anyway, we have fun shopping at Wal-Mart, especially because Seth pushes me around in a wheelchair for the hell of it. Then we head to Sonic, where we eat way too much and then it's off to drive him home. Boo-hoo. We say our goodbyes and I head for home. I get home at 10:00. Then, I began arranging photos in my beautiful new photo album while watching Will and Grace. Then I watched Friends and caught up on my blog. Now I'm exhausted and my apartment is a mess, but I'm exhausted. I'm taking the trash out and then I'm hitting the sack. Night night.

      Well it's pretty much business as usual here in Georgia. I'm not sure if that's good or bad. Yesterday was Thursday and I don't think anything really great or interesting happened. I worked of course. I came home to discover that our Internet was down. Again. Doh! I called the Internet company, per Dad's request, and they said it might be working by tonight (Friday), so we'll see. I did a lot of cleaning and laundry. I made myself a very healthy dinner of grilled chicken and brown rice (yes, it was actually good). Unfortunately, I can't e-mail anyone or balance my checkbook or anything because the Internet is down. I called Seth cause we hadn't spoken in a while. Poor thing is under the weather. :( We were sad because we thought we couldn't see each other this weekend and 2 weeks is too long to not see each other. My sister is coming this Sunday to celebrate her birthday and Seth has to put his sign up for his business. Then I volunteered to come see him on Sunday night after my sister has left. We will eat Mexican and see a movie and I'll finally get to see where his business is going to be. He lives an hour and a half away, but he's worth it and he does it all the time for me. Finally, I go to bed at 12:30. I'm happy cause I don't have to be at work till 1:00 on Friday and that means more sleep. Yippee!!  I didn't wake up until 9:30. . . let's hear it for 9 solid hours of sleep!! Today is Friday and Kim's birthday. That makes me a little sad that we're not speaking. Dos and Luke said I should just call her and pretend that nothing has happened. However, that would be a little difficult because  a) Kim and I don't work like that and b) it's been 3 months since we've spoken! It might have been easier for me to do that a week after the fight, but 3 months?? No way. I went to the grocery store and picked up some yogurt and other necessities. When I got to work, I did send Kim a nice e-card. It basically said that even though we're not on the best of terms, I miss her and I'm thinking of her. I got the notification that she picked up the card around 4:00 pm. However, she has yet to e-mail or call me to thank me or try to patch things up. Great. I guess the ball's in her court now. We weren't really planning on doing anything today anyway. I do have the American Idol tickets, but that's not until next weekend. I guess if we're still not talking, I'll take Seth. I mean, I paid for them and I wanted to see them too. But Kim is also a huge fan and I'll feel bad for going without her. I just don't know what to do about that. Seth said he doesn't like how she treats me sometimes anyway. Oh well. I'll think about it tomorrow (as Scarlett would say). I won Season One of Buffy on DVD a month ago on Ebay and I still haven't received it. I e-mailed the seller and she said she mailed it. She did give me a tracking number and the post office said that they delivered it on July 12th. So where is it?? Great. I'll have to call the post office. It's a good thing that I got the insurance. Work went well, if not kind of quite. Chick-fil-A actually has 7 e-mails right now! Woo-hoo! I'll be alone tomorrow, but I'll be able to keep them under control. Duh. Maybe I can also catch up on a lot of things that I haven't been able to do. I have also been searching for a good Indian restaurant. I have been craving Indian food something fierce. I'll look at reviews and see what's good. But I haven't seen many reviews of Indian restaurants around, so Seth and I will just have to go check them out and be the first. Now, it's ten minutes till I have to leave work and I just wanted to catch up on my blog before I forgot stuff. I feel a migraine coming on, but hopefully it won't hit until  after  the hour long commute home. I'll get home just in time for Will and Grace and then I'll clean some more before hitting the hay. And tomorrow I'm working 2 to 10, so it's more sleeping in. YAY!

      Well yesterday was a not-so-good day. I woke up bright and early at 7 am to get ready for my interview. The interview went really well, I think. I think they liked my answers to their questions and it wasn't as tough as I thought it would be. I know that originally I was up against 400 applicants. I have no idea how many of those passed the written test and got called back for a second interview. I'm sure the competition is still pretty tough. After the interview, I became really ill with a migraine. Dammit. Oh well. Bright side is that I didn't get sick until  after  the interview. On the way home, I was so intent on getting home as quickly as possible that I got caught speeding. I was doing 52 in a 35. Oops. Yeah, a ticket is just what I need. I actually have been really good about speeding lately (too many tickets will do that to you). I just didn't realize the speed limit was only 35 and I didn't realize I was going so fast. He takes forever to give me the ticket and then I'm very careful about going home. And the migraine is getting worse by the minute. Too bad I can't go into work today. Actually, I wasn't all that torn up about it. So I spent the rest of the day sleeping (good 3 hour nap), watching mindless daytime TV, and reading the great book that I had bought at the airport, Good In Bed (not a dirty book really. . . it's a wonderful novel). I went to bed around 11:00, but just kept tossing and turning. My sister called me around 11:15 to tell me when she was coming over this weekend to celebrate her birthday (which is next Monday).  I could not sleep for the life of me, so I got up and watched Just Shoot Me. I also wrote a little. Then, I went to bed and finally passed out.  Today is Luke's birthday!! Happy Birthday Luke! And even though he's younger than me, he's still going to die first because he's a man. Hehe. I woke up bright and early because I had to run errands before work. I went to Target and to my dad's UPS store to mail stuff (free postage rocks). Speaking of which. . . hey Luke, where's my book?? :) It's okay. No rush. Then I head off to work for the first time in 5 days. It's weird being back. We're not too far behind with Chick-fil-A, which is good. I have about 50-something new work e-mails though, so I spend a good twenty minutes going through those. And now I'm on my lunch break, eating my Healthy Choice lunch and catching up on my blog. I didn't want to get too far behind because Luke and Laura will get mad at me. :) Tonight after work, I plan on eating some dinner, doing some much needed cleaning, and catching up on some personal e-mails. Later everyone!

      Okay, so I know that it's been a long time since my last blog (please forgive me), but I'll try to catch everyone up. When I last left off, I was preparing for three 12-hour days in a row. I ended up working 63 hours that week. I know, I know. Insanity! But we got all caught up with Chick-fil-A. Everyone was very impressed with me. I was very impressed with me. The week ended with the promise of Seth coming to visit, which I was really looking forward to. On Saturday night he came over and it was great fun. He didn't get there until 12:30 am, which was more than enough time for me to grab a nap and dinner at Sonic. I had gotten him a Hot Fudge Sundae and he was thrilled with the late night treat. We were very excited about going to see Madonna the next day. We wake up to a beautiful day on Sunday. We get ready and head to Target to get me a calculator and lotion (great combo) and then to the concert. However, my body disappoints me yet again and I come down with the horrible migraine that has been coming on for three weeks. Damn, damn, damn, and damn again. So no concert. I feel really, really bad. I know how much Seth was looking forward to it. He's disappointed, but says he's not mad. We head back home, watch Face/Off, and then Seth goes home. I head to bed to prepare for an early day.  So, on Monday (the 26th), I'm up to 5:00 to prepare to be at work by 7. It's an early day. I'm leaving work early to go to the first part of an interview with DFCS. The day goes by quickly and I head to the interview. The first part is strictly a written exam. The head guy tells all of us that there are 8 to 10 vacancies, but 400 applicants. Ouch. He also said that we could expect a caseload of roughly 1000 cases. Ouch again. That's okay though. I thrive on pressure. The written exam is tough, but not impossible. It's mostly to gauge how good we are with accuracy and details. The guy said that only the people who passed would get a call for a second interview, so I'm keeping my fingers crossed. I then head to my grandmother's to see her before I head out of town this week. We have fun talking and I decide to stay for dinner with my family. Big mistake. We got into a huge political discussion (they started it) about abortion, gay rights, Bush vs. Kerry, religion, the death penalty, etc. It's funny to hear Republicans speak. They're so damn scared that people are out to get their money. I was getting very worked up. But I am a very passionate person. And then they get on this whole kick about how Seth (my gay best friend) is secretly in love with me and I should "jump his bones and see what happens." As if. I can't even deal with that mess. Eventually, I leave. The next night, I go to my grandmother's again to pick something up and have dinner and again my family starts talking politics. Of course, it doesn't get as heavy cause we're being shallow and mostly talking about how everyone looks. I leave. The next day, I work and come home to pack for my Rochester trip and watch the Democratic National Convention.  Thursday, I'm up at 4 am to shower and get ready for work. I'm leaving for Rochester today. Yay!! The best part of the day?? I get a call back from DFCS. . . they asked me for a second interview!! I am so excited. And incredibly nervous. The day goes by quickly and then I go to meet my father at his UPS store so that he can take me to the airport. And wouldn't you know it? My biggest mistake in my entire 24 years, James, is there working. He gets a big kick out of joking that my dad isn't there cause he's off and not coming in today. I believe it for a split second. Then he asks me if I want to play "Scrabble" again. Ugh. Could he be any more obvious? He says I look great with the weight loss, blah, blah, blah. He tries to grill me for information on who I'm going to see in Rochester. I don't give him much. . . let him think what he wants to. (Sorry Luke). Then Dad arrivs and we fight rush hour to get to the airport. My flight is delayed of course. I was scheduled to leave at 8:05 and arrive in Rochester at 10:25. We don't take off until after 9:30 and so I don't get into Rochester until after 11:00. The first person who greets me is Dos. Yay!! She has lost so much weight and she looks fabulous. We talk and laugh while we wait for my luggage. Luke was waiting out front, so we go out to see him and he looks awesome too. And Dos surprised me with Taco Bell!! God, I have not had Taco Bell in MONTHS!! The only thing she got me that I can't have anymore is Mountain Dew. God, I was sooo tempted to drink some. But oh well, The chicken quesadilla and taco are EXCELLENT! I'm in town for less than an hour and we're back to our old routine. . . Taco Bell and Lifetime TV. Good times, good times. I've missed this. Luke goes to bed around 1:00. Dos and I go back to her room, where I am reunited with her rats. Then, we head back to Luke's, where we watch Golden Girls and stay up till 5 talking. I'm surprised to hear just how much she has loved and watched he tape I made her, but I'm happy. And she's thrilled to have another tape. I'm so glad we're both Golden Girls freaks. Even though I'm up for more than 24 hours, I don't feel that tired. Luke also has a cat that attacks my hair several times throughout the night. She's cute, but I'm pretty sure she's posessed by the devil or Bush.  Friday is here and I only got 7 hours of sleep, but I'm good. And it's so great that I don't have to work today. It's rainy, but I don't care. Luke had to go to work, so Dos and I pick him up at 12 to spend some quality time. Dos picks THAT moment to tell me that she's leaving for Philadelphia in a few HOURS to see Kim. Okay, so that pisses me off. Cindy has obviously known about this for a while, but did she warn me? And when Kim invited her to a Sarah concert, couldn't she have said no?? I mean, she hadn't seen me in a year and then she dumps me when something better comes along. Oh well. We pick up a rental car for her and then drop Luke back at work. Then it's off to Golden Port, which I have been craving for months. It is even better than I remember. Then, it's back to Luke's place for our goosbyes. Then I watch TV and fold my blankets and whatnot to get them out of the way. Laura comes over after work to see me. Yay! She looks great as usual. We spend some time chatting and catching up. Then, we go to her apartment so she can change. She has a great apartment. Then, we're back to Luke's house to wait for him to come over for dinner. His friend Linda also comes over (she's very nice) and Kerri comes over too. It was great seeing her again also. We go to this great restaurant, Raging Burrito, where the burritos are the size of your head (well, almost). It's excellent. Then Laura, Luke, Kerri, and I go to see Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It's a pretty good movie. Weird, but good. Then we go back to Luke's place. Kerri and Laura leave and it's just me and Luke. We have fun watching TV (which, according to Luke, gets raunchy after midnight). We end up watching Discovery Health, which is showing all these plastic surgeries. It's interesting though. Around 1:00 or so, we go to bed.  The next morning, we're up at 9:30 or so. Luke goes to run errands and then comes back so that we can go eat breakfast and spend some more quality time together. We went to Jay's Diner, which I haven't been to in a year (probably because I haven't been in town for a year). After some yummy French toast and nice Luke quality time, we're back to Luke's so that he can get ready for the wedding that he has to go to (and that I am crashing). Laura comes over and wraps the wedding gift and we're off for a 2-hour drive to the wedding. The wedding is a nice ceremony. The bride's dress is absolutely gorgeous. It is a long Catholic ceremony though. Ugh. We're all thinking it. Then we go to the reception, which is decorated nicely. We have a great dinner and Laura and I have fun talking about what we want for our weddings. It's funny cause Laura is practically engaged and I have no one. I hae to feel sorry for myself, but I'm so damn lonely. I'm not sure if Luke has very much sympathy for me. I get down and tired for a while, but then we have great fun dancing the night away. I had never done the Electric Slide or the Chicken Dance before and I really had a lot of fun. We all did. Then we go home around 11:00 or so. Laura and I fall asleep in the car and Luke has to stay awake all by himself. Poor thing. We all go back to Luke's and Laura is sleeping over. Yay!  It is my last day. :( We wake up and Luke wants to go get some bagels for breakfast. I'm not that hungry, so Laura and Luke go eat, while I shower and make myself beautiful (doesn't take very long). Then they come back and we go to Park Laigh, a very cool Rochester store that I had never been to before. We browse for a while, I buy some candy, and then we leave. We try to go to the poster store, but it's closed on Sundays. Dammit. It's okay cause we go to lunch at Uno's. Amazing chili and burgers. Yum yum! We have so much fun taking pictures and laughing at absolutely nothing. We also talk about the possibility of coming back in October for Meloria Weekend and I think I will. I love it here. Crazy, I know. We also talk about Laura and Luke both coming to see me in Georgia. I hope they do. I miss them and I would love to show Laura everything. Luke says he loved Georgia, which makes me happy. Anyway, then we go to Charlotte beach to walk the pier and eat ice cream. It is a beautiful day. Then, it's a rush to get back home and get me to the airport. Of course, I make it. I'm sad about leaving Luke and Laura. And I am pissed off that Dos did not make it back in time, like she said she would. She didn't even call me. Whatever. The plane is full again and it is filled with screaming babies. Again. I start talking to the guy sitting next to me, who is from Jamaica. Of course he has 3 children, the oldest of which is 16. Yikes. I am finally back in Georgia. Yech. The heat is unbelievable. It's 88 degrees, but I swear it feels like 90-something. The heat just slaps you in the face. I've been gone for three days and I've forgotten how humid it is. Dad takes me to get my car and I head home. I spend the next several hours doing nothing. It's good to be home.  It's Monday and I'm up at 9:00 am. I spend several hours watching TV and unpacking. Then I go to the doctor. Good news! He tells me that my knee is fine and it doesn't feel like it'll pop out again. He said that I can wean myself off the brace and that I need to do exercises to strengthen my knee. I go home and eat a Lean Pockets for lunch. Then I spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning, unpacking, and trying to de-clutter my room. I now have 5 trash bags of garbage. I also download pictures for Luke and Laura. After MANY attempts, Laura finally gets them from my computer. I look up stuff for Meloria weekend. I decide that I'll buy my tickets for stuff after I find out if I get the new job or not. If I do, then I probably won't be able to go. I can't wait though. I hate it here in Georgia. But tickets are on sale, so I'll get them when I find out, which will be soon. Then, I spend the rest of the night catching up on my blog, showering, watching TV, and doing laundry. After a fabulous break from work, I must go back tomorrow. But I also have an early morning interview for the DFCS job, so keep your fingers crossed!! Bye bye!
