       AAAWWW!! A whole weekend with air. We got power back Wed. evening. It went back off Thur. morning but had it back completely Thur. afternoon. Yeah! Air! It's like heaven. Been cutting back on Zofran. Causing serious constipation. Yuck and ouch! I seem to be doing ok with it so maybe m/s is easing up a bit. I sure hope so. Doc. appt. on Friday. Looking forward to that. I got doppler in the mail. No luck finding heartbeat yet. I know it's still early but I hope to be able to find it someday soon.

       Day 6 without power. Hot Hot Hot...105-110 with the heat index. DH sees the power men down the street and decides to have a chat with them. Next thing I know he's buying them pizza. Two large pizza's. Of course they are very nice and thankful and tell him they will try and get our electric on by tonight but there are two breaks in the lines they can't find. Oh well it was a nice gesture right...more like a bribe to me. :)  Ate two hot dogs from 7-11 for lunch. Not sitting to well I have to admit. I do not know why I torcher myself the way I do. I knew before I ate them it was going to hurt.

       Still no power. Ugh!! Getting really tired of it. Thank goodness mom and dad got theirs back so we stayed there last night. Haven't really been feeling all that hot. Been real sick to my stomach again the past couple of days. Payton's staying at a friends house tonight (Tanya) and I guess it's another night at the parents for dh and I.

       Well the storm has passed but the devastation it left behind is everywhere. Huge oaks the size of houses are toppled over like toys. We are still without power. That storm was nothing like I have ever seen before. It was beautiful and scary at the same time. On a more positive note the pregnancy is going along just fine. I have an appt. on Fri with Dr. DeReaux. She is the doc that did my d&amp;c after the miscarriage. I'm not as nervous as I was in the beginning. Still have to take meds or m/s hits. I have already gained a couple of pounds due to all the carbs I've been eating. Hope doc doesn't get on to me about that. Bill and Payton took water and supplies to Robert and family (bil). The are an hour away in Winter Haven. They lost all their shingles off the roof and there neighborhood was hit pretty hard. I guess they can't find water or ice anywhere. We had some gallons left over so they drove them over.
