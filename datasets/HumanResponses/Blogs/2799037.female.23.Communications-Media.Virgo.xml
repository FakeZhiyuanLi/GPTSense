      This blog isn't journalistic in nature, but I wanted to be able to tell my faithful readers that I have finally been freed from my cast! I'm in a structured boot now, and have scheduled surgery on my left foot for July 23. Please pray for me as this next surgery will be more complicated than the last. I'll be so glad when this whole nightmare is behind me. When it is, I'll have two brand new feet... almost. My right one looks like a new foot, and my left will be a more dramatic change.

      To borrow my sister's favorite blonde phrase, I don't get it! Don't the terrorists understand that the United States (and now Saudi Arabia) won't negotiate over the lives of people? If they do understand, why do they keep taking hostages, bargaining to get what they want and beheading their hostages when they don't get their way? Don't they understand that they're never going to get anything they want if they don't give us what we want? How many people have to die? I think they know they're not going to have their demands met; they just want to kill people.  How can this world be so evil? It's only getting worse. I know that God made a promise to Noah and all mankind never to destroy the Earth by flooding again. Might He do it another way? It makes one wonder how evil the world was when God destroyed it, and how those times compared to these. If God hadn't promised not to destroy the Earth, would this be the time He would have chosen to do it again?

      On NBC at noon today, there was a special broadcast about men and women who are having treatments done, some of them on an experimental basis, to extend the time they have to conceive children.   Currently, women's pregnancies are riskier after age 35, which is usually long before they begin menopause. Doctors are trying to find a way to extend this widow for pregnancy because there are more and more women wanting to start their families later in life, or just continue to grow their families.  Men who have problems with erectile dysfunction, sex drive and moods (yes, I said "moods". You have moods and will have to deal with it.) are being tested for a dip in testosterone production, which can solve a lot of those problems. So people in America may be having more and more kids.  This may be more of a problem for the rest of us, though. Are we really sure we want some of these people to reproduce?

      Welcome, all of you faithful readers and bloggers. I have created this blog in light of a decision I've made to make my blogging more interesting. I figured that since my old blog was not getting the kind of traffic I wanted, I needed a tabula rasa (clean slate) to work with. These blogs will be more related to current events than my previous blog, and hopefully will instigate compelling discussion.  This is a new beginning, a time of rebirth and growth. Join me in my journalistic journey!

      I'll make this short because my medicines are making me drowsy and dizzy.  I spent three nights and almost four days at the hospital. Now, my left foot is wrapped in a splint and padding that probably weighs about 10 pounds or more, including the plaster that was used to make the structure of the brace.  Very dramatic improvement, I guess. I won't know for two weeks what my foot looks like. That's when I get my staples and stitches removed. Apparently I've got a couple of pins sticking out of my foot that need to be taken out, too. I didn't know that part. Now I'm scared. I can't even see my toes, and my big toe is numb.  Just like "The Bride" in "Kill Bill," it's going to be a while before I can "wiggle my big toe."  I love our church. We were told tonight that instead of two weeks-worth of food delivered by members of our church, it'll be three weeks-worth because so many people wanted to help out! Isn't that great!? I feel so loved!!  Thanks for the prayers. I still need them.   Okay, pain meds are making me sleepy. I'll talk later.

      Well, I have to be at the hospital at 5:30 tomorrow morning to prepare for my 7:30 surgery to basically reconstruct my left foot. Am I nervous? Kind of. Anxious? You'd better believe I've got pent-up anxiety! But at the same time, I know that God will direct the mind and hands of my very-capable surgeon, Dr. Steven Howell of the Kansas Orthopaedic Center. He did a remarkable job on my right foot, and it works like a dream.  I know that a lot of people are praying for me. Thank you. Please also pray for Dr. Howell. He's allotted four hours for my surgery in the morning, after which he's scheduled to play in a golf tournament for which he was recruited by another doctor at KOC.  Thank you, also, in advance to my pastor, Pastor Hoger, who will be visiting me in the hospital at least twice during my stay: once tomorrow after I get out of surgery and again on Sunday so he can give us (Ron and me) a miniature service and Holy Communion.  Now, I know I get a lot of visits to my blog because my hit counter tells me so. But I almost never get comments. You don't have to say much if you don't want to, but it would be nice to know who you are and that you're there. I started my counter at 55. Now, I've got about 300 hits counted. If you don't want to say much, that's fine, but I would like to know that I've got your support or that you have an opinion about what I've blogged on, or both.  For now, I'll end this blog. I'll catch back up to you after I return home from the hospital. Many blessings to you for reading and praying for me.

      There have been a lot of people lately talking on television about how horrible this world is and how they can't understand how bad it's gotten. I'll admit that if I don't think very hard about it, I would wonder the same thing. But there is something we can do for the future, and those who have kids young enough to mold can do a lot.  Ron and I have been married for almost two years. We have no kids, but would like to have some someday. When we do, and when they misbehave and are old enough to understand right from wrong, we're going to teach them the consequences of their actions. If that means we have to spank them, we will. That's not child abuse, despite what some may say. It's discipline. I was spanked as a child. Ron said he was, too, until the spankings didn't hurt anymore. Then he and his siblings were fined for their misbehavior. Yes, they were expected to pay out of their allowance that they got for doing chores every time they did something wrong. It taught them money management and that good deeds are rewarded just as bad behavior is punished.  We're going to make sure that we go to church every Sunday and that we're all involved somehow. Right now, even though I have physical handicaps, I can participate in a way that not everyone can: I sing in the choir or perform solos, and I'm also on a special music scholarship committee. Ron mows the lawn and keeps in touch with church politics (sometimes, I think, a little too much).  If children are to grow up knowing right from wrong, and know the spiritual consequences for their actions, have a proper understanding of the Law and Gospel, and know how to manage their money, we need to start them out young. Otherwise, who's to say they won't end up wondering who their babies' daddies are, shooting someone at school because they think it's funny or to get back at someone for saying or doing something against them, or taking their own lives because they've found not hope but despair?  We need to make sure that our children understand the times in which we live and that they are raised to know how to correct the mistakes of our generations. We need to make sure that tomorrow's leaders are prepared today, because when the time comes for the end of the world, we want to make sure that we go out with no regrets, knowing that we did what we could to make this world a better place in which to live.

      I was recently asked by one of my dedicated readers why I'm not posting as often as I did on my Edited Copy blog. Allow me to explain:  When I was posting on Edited Copy, I just posted for the joy of posting. Anything went. But this is a "whole new blog," as I explained in my first post on this site. I'm not posting just to be posting anymore. I've decided to look for the not-so-obvious news items that catch my eye and blog about them. In my opinion, this makes for a more interesting blog and gives you a better read. I mean, do you really want to know about everything that goes on in Ericaland? Didn't think so.  In the meantime, just keep checking back to see if I've found anything else postworthy. But don't look for too much very soon after the 23rd. That's when the ol' left foot gets the knife. And I'll be needing more prayers. ...And just when I'm starting to wear matching shoes again!  Don't give up on me. I'm still here, still posting, and still reading everyone else's blogs.

      I usually try to take e-mails with a grain of salt, especially when it comes to politics and when I don't know the origins, only the sender. But I didn't see this one on the fact or fiction site that I use to check the validity of e-mails, so take it as you will. According to the message, it contains the text of a speech given by U.S. Navy Captain Ouimette, the Executive Officer at Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Florida.   In it, he lists "terrorist attacks" that have been executed against American citizens since 1979, and asserts that these attacks are interrelated... a continuous attack that he describes as World War III ... and America has been hitting the snooze button on the alarm clock every time.  Here is the speech, in its entirety. Draw your own conclusions.  AMERICA NEEDS TO WAKE UP!  That's what we think we heard on the 11th of September 2001 (When more than 3,000 Americans were killed ) and maybe it was, but I think it should  have been "Get Out of Bed!" In fact, I think the alarm clock has been buzzing since 1979 and we have continued to hit the snooze button and roll over for a few more minutes of peaceful sleep since then.  It was a cool fall day in November 1979 in a country going through a religious and political upheaval when a group of Iranian students attacked and seized the American Embassy in Tehran. This seizure was an outright attack on American soil; it was an attack that held the world's most  powerful country hostage and paralyzed a Presidency. The attack on this sovereign U. S. embassy set the stage for events to follow for the next 23 years.  America was still reeling from the aftermath of the Vietnam experience and had a serious threat from the Soviet Union when then-President Carter, had to do something. He chose to conduct a clandestine raid in the desert. The ill-fated mission ended in ruin, but stood as a symbol of America's inability to deal with terrorism.  America's military had been decimated and down-sized/right-sized since the end of the Vietnam War. A poorly trained, poorly equipped, and poorly organized military was called on to execute a complex mission that was doomed from the start.  Shortly after the Tehran experience, Americans began to be kidnapped and killed throughout the Middle East. America could do little to protect her citizens living and working abroad. The attacks against US soil continued.  In April of 1983, a large vehicle packed with high explosives was driven into the US Embassy compound in Beirut. When it exploded, it killed 63 people. The alarm went off again and America hit the Snooze Button once more.  Then just six short months later, a large truck, heavily laden down with over 2500 pounds of TNT, smashes through the main gate of the US Marine Corps headquarters in Beirut and 241US servicemen are killed. America mourns her dead and hits the Snooze Button once more.  Two months later in December 1983, another truck loaded with explosives is driven into the US Embassy in Kuwait, and America continues her slumber.  The following year, in September 1984, another van was driven into the gates of the US Embassy in Beirut and America slept.  Soon the terrorism spreads to Europe. In April 1985, a bomb explodes in a restaurant frequented by US soldiers in Madrid.  Then in August, a Volkswagen loaded with explosives is driven into the main gate of the US Air Force Base at Rhein-Main; 22 are killed and the snooze alarm is buzzing louder and louder as US interests are continually attacked.  Fifty-nine days later, a cruise ship, the Achille Lauro, is hijacked and we watched as an American in a wheelchair is singled out of the passenger list and executed.  The terrorists then shift their tactics to bombing civilian airliners when they bomb TWA Flight 840 in April of 1986 that killed 4 and the most tragic bombing, Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 259.  Clinton treated these terrorist acts as crimes; in fact, we are still trying to bring these people to trial. These are acts of war. The wake-up alarm is getting louder and louder.   The terrorists decide to bring the fight to America. In January 1993, two CIA agents are shot and killed as they enter CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.  The following month, February 1993, a group of terrorists are arrested after a rented van packed with explosives is driven into the underground parking garage of the World Trade Center in New York City. Six people are killed and over 1000 are injured. Still, this is a crime and not an act of war? The Snooze alarm is depressed again.  Then in November 1995, a car bomb explodes at a US military complex in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, killing seven service men and women.  A few months later in June of 1996, another truck bomb explodes only 35 yards from the US military compound in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. It destroys the Khobar Towers, a US Air Force barracks, killing 19 and injuring over 500.   The terrorists are getting braver and smarter as they see that America does not respond decisively. They move to coordinate their attacks in a simultaneous attack on two US  embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. These attacks were planned with precision. They kill 224. America responds with cruise missile attacks and goes back to sleep.  The USS Cole was docked in the port of Aden, Yemen, for refueling on 12 October 2000, when a small craft pulled along side the ship and exploded, killing 17 US Navy Sailors. Attacking a US War Ship is an act of war, but we sent the FBI to investigate the crime and went back to sleep.  And, of course, you know the events of 11 September 2001. Most Americans think this was the first attack against US soil or in America. How wrong they are. America has been under a constant attack since 1979 and we chose to hit the snooze alarm and roll over and go back to sleep.  In the news lately, we have seen lots of finger pointing from every high official in government over what they knew and what they didn't know. But if you've read the papers and paid a little attention, I think you can see exactly what they knew. You don't have to be in the FBI or CIA or on the National Security Council to see the pattern that has been developing since 1979.  Our President is right on when he says we are engaged in a war. I think we have been in a war for the past 23 years and it will continue until we as, a people, decide enough is enough.  America needs to "Get out of Bed" and act decisively now. America has been changed forever. We have to be ready to pay the price and make the sacrifice to ensure our way of life continues. We cannot afford to keep hitting the snooze button again and again and rolling over and going back to sleep.  After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Admiral Yamamoto said "...it seems all  we have done is awakened a sleeping giant."  This is the message we need to disseminate to terrorists around the world.  Support Our Troops and support President Bush for having the courage, political or militarily, to address what so many who preceded him didn't have the backbone to do, both Democrat and Republican. This is not a political thing to be hashed over in an election year; this is an AMERICAN  thing. This is about our Freedom and the Freedom of our children and grandchildren in years to come.  Please forward this, especially to the young people and all those who dozed off in history class and who seem so quick to protest such a necessary military action.  If God is your Co-Pilot---Change seats!   Now, I'm a little fuzzy on my history and I admit that I haven't acutally taken the time to verify the events in the timeline that he describes. That I'll say upfront. But it does make for intriguing thought. Is it at all possible that he could be right?

      My husband thinks I know enough about beauty and skin care (since I'm an Independent Mary Kay Beauty Consultant) and that I'm so good at it (because of all the women at church who are excited about their new looks that I helped them achieve) that he also thinks that I should create a new blog dedicated to skin care and makeup.  My question is this: Is there any interest out there amongst anyone who reads this blog (or do you know someone) who would be interested in reading and commenting or asking questions on a blog related to skin care and beauty?  If I don't get any comments on this post, I guess I'll know that there's no interest.  And, by the way, please don't ask questions if you're not serious. This means you, Josh. For everyone else, complete confidentiality will be maintained so my husband can't make fun of you if you're a guy.

      Okay, so I got my hubby to help me on this. So what? I only know what I need to about computers.  I've added a link to a Lutheran couple who blog together as Love and Blunder. Their names are Rob and Devona, and they're expecting a baby! How wonderful!! She's a waitress, and I'm not sure yet what he does because he hasn't blogged about it yet. Devona sees her growing belly as a different kind of new creation: her body becoming comparable to that of a turtle, her belly being the shell. Check out the cool picture she created with her head at the top on their website! Gotta love it.  Also, since I'm a Mary Kay consultant (for four years this month, actually), I asked my wonderful husband to create a few links in that honor. One goes straight to my Mary Kay website where you can look around for yourself or for a gift for someone else (male or female) (and Josh, no more joke e-mails), and if you're so inclined, shop online. I've got a full inventory of just about everything you'll find on the website, and am willing to answer questions related to skin care or color cosmetics needs. If you decide to buy something, I can ship it to you. AND, if you buy $20-worth of products or more, you get a free gift! So, take advantage!  Related to the website are links that allow you to e-mail me directly from my blog. One goes to my Mary Kay e-mail address, and the other goes to the e-mail address that Ron and I share.  I've also added a couple of links to sites run by a friend of mine named Katy Towell. She and I graduated from high school together, and somehow she ended up in California doing web design. She has her own business building web sites for people, and she also started a way cool e-zine (online magazine) for women. The main features are about rock stars from the 80s who still seem to have spunk and flair with modern crowds. She tries to publish every month, but it doesn't always happen. That's okay. But when she does publish, I usually know it because I'm her copy editor. Go Katy!  Speaking of copy editing, if you know of anyone who will be needing a copy editor for their newspaper in or around mid-September and they're anywhere near Wichita, Kansas, let me know. I'd love a full-time editing job, but I have to wait until I'm released to go back to work. Stupid feet having to be reconstructed so they don't hurt all the time! Grrrr!! (You'd think that 15 surgeries would be enough, but I had to have two more this summer!)  Okay, I'm super hyper and I think I'd better stop now. So enjoy my new links!

      I recently signed up for a newsletter from the best news station in Wichita. Coincidentally, I worked for this station shortly after graduating from high school, but hated it. I turned from broadcast media to print, and still love it, even though, as my husband would say, print media is going the way of the dinosaurs.  One little item in the news recently has me all fired up. Those of you who know me know that I'm allergic to cigarrette smoke, so I am naturally attracted to the idea that smoking could be banned in public places, including restaraunts and bars. I've never been able to go to bars with friends because I can't be around the smoke that permeates the air.  Tonight, the Tobacco Free Wichita Coalition is supposed to speak during the public forum at tonight's city council meeting. The benefit to this is that the word will get out that people want Wichita establishments to go smoke-free. The bad part is that during a public forum, no decisions can be made by the council.  A web poll on KAKE.com asked people if they would be in favor of such a ban. When I cast my vote, I saw that more than 75 percent of responders were also in favor of the ban. I hope that's a good indicator that a ban would pass.  Restaraunt owners are afraid that they might lose business if they bend to such a ban, but I think that they might actually gain business that they otherwise might not have. I mean, how many people (nonsmokers) like to come home smelling so bad that their kids won't even hug them? The odor stays in clothing, in your hair, and is difficult to get out unless you wash your clothes thorougly and take a shower. It's especially bad for pregnant women both to smoke and to be around second-hand smoke. The effects on the unborn child can be devestating. Even after they're born, children whose lungs are still developing will suffer greatly if they're exposed to cigarette smoke. They're more likely to have allergies and asthma, too.  A few years ago, I worked as an intern in the Community Education department of our local Health Department. The west wing of the department had a doctor's office where people could go if they didn't have the money or insurance to go to a regular doctor. I absolutely sickened me when I saw pregnant women trying to finish their cigarettes outside the clinic before going in for a check up. I wanted to go up to them and say, "Do you even care that you could be killing your unborn child?" Personally, I believe that pregnant smokers are very selfish for putting themselves before the health and livlihood of their children. The same goes for parents who smoke around their children. If they truly loved their children, they would make every effort to quit and they would refrain from exposing the children to their nasty habit.  The world would be much healthier if cigarettes had never been invented. They don't make anyone look "cool" and they certainly aren't attractive to anyone with class.

      If you're looking for something newsy here, you're not going to get it this time. I'll get back to it sooner or later, but first, there's something I need to do.  My husband has been bearing a burden larger than he ever imagined he would have to bear, and it's all because he chose to marry me. Since April, he has been a great help to me in many ways. For two months, I was unable to do housework or care for myself very well. And now, I'm back in that position. He has graciously taken on my duties by doing the housework and has also done for me what I cannot do for myself. He took a week off from work so he could be with me after my surgery. I've needed him and have been able to rely on him no matter what; he's the one person I can trust to help me when I need it and not give excuses or be twenty minutes late doing it.  Ron, for your self-sacrifice and for all you've done and continue to do for me in my time of need, I want to say thank you, and I want all those who visit my blog to know it. When God paired us together, neither of us could have imagined how much we would mean to each other. And in 30 days, we'll celebrate two years of marriage. I only wish I could do more to show you my appreciation.  You may have a reputation as "The Terrible Swede," but you're anything but "terrible" when you're with me.
