[Chorus] I love you more everyday You show me love in everyway There's nothing left for me to say But I love you I love you more everyday You show me love in everyway There's nothing left for me to say But I love you  I won't stop loving you And I won't stop kissing you You're the reason why I smile And I won't stop holding you And I won't stop loving you You're the reason why I smile  [Chorus] X2 I love you more everyday You show me love in everyway There's nothing left for me to say But I love you I love you more everyday You show me love in everyway There's nothing left for me to say But I love you          Last night was a great night. We did some stuff... and we actually talked afterwards. I love talking to her, it makes me so happy just to talk to her. We could have talked all night buh she had to go to the restroom, and I think I fell asleep while she was gone. She came in laid there for a lil bit and started shaking me really hard haha yea... Last night was just awesome. I love her so much.

						    Damn. It sucks that I fucked up and I can never take it back. I love her so much and there's nothing I can do to prove it to her. I wanna prove to her that there is no one above her. No one will ever be. Evertime I tell her that I love her more, in the back of her mind I know that she's thinking about the Amanda thing... It sucks. I wish more than anything that I can erase that from her mind and replace it with something good. I don't think she'll ever believe me. I don't she ever has. I don't know what the fuck was up with me that weekend but it was a mistake. Trully it was. I love her. I really do.

						   Damn, I miss my girl. She's at her bbq right now. I wish I could be there with her. I miss her so much. I usually see her at least once a day since I've been back from Maryland. Today will be the first day, since I've been back, that I can't see her. I could go if I wanted to. I'm pretty sure if I asked my parents they would let me go. But, I dunno if I wanna go cause she wants to drink and if I'm there she won't. I want her to have fun so yea... I dunno maybe I'll go. I wanna meet some of her friends. Anyways... Gunna go think about it for a bit.  *Babie I miss you so much.*  I ended up goin to the bbq it was fun, afterwards she came and spent the night so yea I had fun. I'm glad i decided to go. Her friends are pretty cool. There was an emotional goodbye though cause some of her friends are leaving for college and shit... Yea some people started crying it was sad buy then again... I thought it was kinda funny.
