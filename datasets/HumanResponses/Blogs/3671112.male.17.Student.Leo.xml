       urlLink mono  1.0 is supposed to be released today. got into  urlLink python  some more. i made a program that prints out my  urlLink amule  stats and then made an  urlLink xchat  plugin to do the same thing except msg it to the active channel. also made a stupid thing that makes use of uname. oh well, whatever, i'm tired and low on cigarettes, so i'm going to bed.

      last night i had, as the title of this post suggests, a really weird dream. i was leading this group of like 10 people into a huge castle/fortress. we all stayed together with our backs to eachother and took out the entire entrance court thing. i remember someone was going to behead a guy and i was like "no no.. give him an honorable death!" and pushed him onto his knees and thrust the sword through the back of his neck and into his body, and of course it went right through because it was a dream. and i guess i got that from the movie Gladiator. then we all spread out all over the castle to kill anything we found alive. some time later, and i have no idea how much time that would be since it was a dream, i found that every member of my group was dead except for me, and everyone on the enemy's side was dead too except for the leader. i climbed up a shitload of stairs to the very top of the castle where i found these two huge wooden doors. then this big satan-like demon creature thing bursts through them at me and i woke up. guess i'm not the man for that kind of job. i gotta render a movie based on this dream some time though.

      i slept like a baby all night and woke up at 7am. took a shower, made something to drink and gave the cats some food. sat at the computer, lit a cigarette, turned on some  urlLink Stevie Ray Vaughn . checked some of my favorite sites for updates, caught up on emails, and checked my  urlLink aMule  downloads.  awesome morning so far? yes

      ever since i got on linux i've been exploring what all is possible with it. from  urlLink XMMS  to  urlLink aMule ,  urlLink RealPlayer  to  urlLink Gaim ,  urlLink X-Chat  to  urlLink The GIMP , i've definitely done a lot of exploring. and now that i'm comfortable with linux, i've decided it's time to get back to hacking. i've been very interested in  urlLink mono , even before i switched to linux. even though i already know some C# from developing with the .NET framework on windows, and even though it is a very well designed, and very powerful language, i've become interested in  urlLink Python . and since i know you can use any language with mono, i've decided i'm going to try to use python with it, and go down that path.  today i discovered  urlLink wxPython , and it's awesome.

      so google accepted my application for AdSense, and i logged in and it asked me for all this info, which i gave, without needing to look anything up. then when i started reading the terms and conditions it says: .. you must be at least 18 years of age .. (or something like that). *alt+left,left,left*. bummer. i can see how they might require you to be at a legal working age for your state.. but they strictly forbid porn and things like that, so i'm not sure where the 18 comes from. i'm employable. i'm taxable. believe me, i'm very taxable.  but in other good news, i passed out on my bed around 6pm last night and woke up about 30 minutes ago. feeling pretty good right now. a little sore, but still, it feels good to be up this early, and not because i stayed up all night.  but anyway, i just lost like 20% of the respect i had for google (so i'm now at 80%), so fuck that anyway. i have something else lined up for advertising. something that will pay me by time, not by clicks. so take that google! jk ilu <3 ;(

      i've been thinking about buying a digital camera lately. IrenicPenguin of the  urlLink aMule  team told me he likes the  urlLink Fujifilm Finepix A330 , and it's only $200, AND available for pick-up at  urlLink Best Buy  stores (which is preferable for me), so i can just take a 10 minute trip to best buy once i get the money. however, any other  urlLink suggestions are welcome .  i think  urlLink Nat Friedman  was kidnapped or something  [edited: apparently amule.org needs the www subdomain - fixed]

      ok so it'd been three or four days or something since i signed up for  urlLink AdSense  and i still hadn't gotten a response from the  urlLink Google Team , so i decided to try to log in to my account and see if it was still in review or what. when i tried it it turns out my email address doesn't exist in their system. so i reapplied and tried logging in and this time it worked (said they were gonna look at my site to make sure it wasn't the devil first/i'm still in the list of sites to be reviewed). so hopefully that'll be happening soon.  does anyone know how to work  urlLink Ximian Red Carpet ? and is it just me or does the logo look like a roll of  urlLink Fruit by the Foot ? and there's no way anyone is going to pay that much for fruit by the foot, no matter how many rolls there are in the box. i'd rather have about 12  urlLink Jr. Bacon Cheeseburgers ? (no they don't look anything like that but they're still very good)  Red Carpet logo:

      today i went and mowed my grandmother's lawn.. well, three of her lawns. i did all three of them without stopping, and it only took me about an hour because of that. however, it wasn't a very good idea seeing how:   i'm a pretty heavy smoker  i stayed up all night  i had ate some cocoa pebbles before i left  the result: when i finished my heart was in my throat and i had the runs. and i'm really sore and tired now.  but anyway, lately i've been playing  urlLink freeciv  a lot. i guess the whole idea of running a civilization is appealing to me, even though i suck at it. a lot. i mean, i don't even know what half the words in it mean. but it's still fun. check it out.

      as most of us know, most of the  urlLink linux  camp seems to believe that linux will overtake  urlLink microsoft  in terms of popularity in the near future (1-2 years). while linux enterprise solutions  urlLink Red Hat  and  urlLink SuSE LINUX  are always  urlLink rated better  by companies not paid by microsoft to do the benchmarks, and the open source community is growing at a tremendous rate, the likelihood of microsoft actually dying any time in the next  few decades  is slim-to-none. for more information on this issue, and also information on how and why developers are switching to web applications, check out  urlLink this great article .  the Cocoa# team apparently got  urlLink their first window  running, so  urlLink mono  on  urlLink Mac OS X  seems to be coming along ok.  this has to be at least the tenth time i've tried to get this entry to post correctly.

      today i signed up for  urlLink Google AdSense , the only non-annoying advertising program available. i just hope they'll accept my poor blog that just started out. hopefully that'll change though, as my goal is to be the #1 google result for "charlie head" (on top of the hundreds of results containing "charlie's head"). i'm hoping that  urlLink linking  to any  urlLink sites  relevant to as many  urlLink words  that i use as  urlLink possible  will help me reach that goal (yes, i am a geek).  by the way, beta 3 of  urlLink mono  was released a few days ago. get it  urlLink here . mark your calendars, 1.0 is set to be released june 30.

      i modified the "Minima"  urlLink Blogger  template a little, making it more like what i would have done, and removing that cheesy "ABOUT ME" profile thing. also changed the general font, as i like sans serif better than serif.

      i made the switch. to  urlLink linux . running  urlLink FreeBSD  4.10-STABLE became more work for what i wanted to do than i needed. almost every time i downloaded a source tarball, i had to hack the code a little to get it to compile on my machine. what was especially troubling was that i couldn't get the newest  urlLink Gtk#  to make, along with a number of other  urlLink mono  goodies.  so i did some snooping around and decided  urlLink Fedora Core 2  would be best for me. downloading the 4 install discs was kind of a pain in the ass, even on a 3 mbits/s dsl connection, but once they were burned and i booted to disc1, installation was easy and very fast considering all the packages i decided to install.  i'd say i'm happier overall on linux.

      the past week has been completely devoted to non-stop development of the Tactx game that i'm working on. in a week the map editor went from  urlLink this  to  urlLink this . and the latter was taken two days ago i believe. currently i'm working on a nasty bug in the map editor that causes a segfault on my machine (linux) and a rather large memory leak on windows which causes the system to freeze.    you can check out the site at  urlLink http://dextrocardia.net/tactx  but if the latest version is 0.1.2, i wouldn't download it. but other than this bug it's really nice. with Szymon Labunski's textures it looks really realistic and the map editor pretty much lets you do anything you want. once we (Szymon Labunski and i) think the map editor is bug-free, we'll start work on the multiplayer client and server. the site has up-to-date information if you're interested.

      lately i've been working on a Final Fantasy Tactics-style engine (i think there's also a game called Battle Ogre or something that's similar and came before FFT?). i'm calling it the Tactx Engine (catchy, huh?). there's not much right now, as i started on it two days ago, but here's  urlLink a screenshot  i took about an hour ago. coding the map editor first so i'll have a map format to load and build the rest of the engine on top of. the Square class i made is looking pretty good so far, and hopefully everything that follows will too.    oh, and the code is cross-platform, thanks to  urlLink glut . i'm using  urlLink freeglut  on my linux machine, but a friend of mine compiled what i have so far on his windows machine using  urlLink MinGW  and the "official" glut port to windows, and it worked fine (had to define GLUT_DISABLE_AFHACK_SOMETHING - or something similar, don't remember - for it to compile on windows, but it works (and yes, the process DOES exit, for those of you who know what i'm talking about). anyway,  urlLink OpenGL  kicks ass. period.

      a friend of mine, rob, is going to let me put his adsense code on my site, and we'll split the earnings 50/50. the ads are under the archives section on the right, above the ads that i put just because i want to support the sites they came from :)    feel free to click an ad if you see something you're interested in.

      i finished an atom backend and Kevin Godby and i decided there should be a single blog backend. so, i created a BlogBackend.cs (later renamed to FeedBackend.cs). it uses  urlLink Atom.NET  and  urlLink RSS.NET . kevin is working on the makefile stuff for it right now and i think we need to change something in the cluechainer to make links to atom feeds work when they come from things like  urlLink Gaim  and  urlLink X-Chat . but i honestly don't know about all that. anyway, it's looking good. hopefully it'll be in cvs by this weekend. turns out i really like making backends for dashboard. hopefully i'll make some more soon.

      i woke up this morning confused. before i fell asleep, a lot of things went on that i don't seem to remember because i guess i was so tired. and last night i had the weirdest dream(s). i dreamed i broke my leg and had to stay in a wheelchair for the rest of my life (yeah right, i know). but i could like jump around in it and stuff. yeah. i jumped up a high, steep set of stairs in it. and then i remember thinking "once my cats learn to fly they're going to fly away forever and i'll miss them." i don't know, but when i woke up i brought two cups from on my desk to the kitchen, turned on the faucet, sat the cups in the drainer, and walked away, with the water still running. my mom asked "are those clean?" and once i realized what i did i said "no but i just woke up. whatever."

      by the way, if you want to play around with beagle and dashboard, they're on gnome cvs. just do this to get get them.  $ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome login $ (just hit enter when it asks for password) $ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.gnome.org:/cvs/gnome co beagle  and then just do the same, replacing "beagle" with "dashboard." hopefully my sleepiness didn't fuck that up.

      i started making an atom backend for dashboard that uses the rss renderer. it's a really simple task, yeah, but with the exception of  one  atom i've tried, some uri exception is always thrown. a parse error. that means there's an invalid uri somewhere in the atom feed. but i don't know what it could be. right now i'm playing with  urlLink Chris Schmidt's Atom , because it doesn't cause the uri exception to be thrown (i almost typed throughn, that's how sleepy i am right now). but he says he hasn't touched atom before. and there i was thinking he was just really good with standards. oh well, i'll work on it tomorrow after i get some sleep, with a clear head.

      i think 41 hours of being awake is enough. i gotta get plenty of sleep so i can stay up again all weekend because the parents and sister (and poodle,  yesss ) will be out of town. in Helen, GA to be exact. got plenty of cigarettes and soda for the occasion. and plenty of ideas on shit to do, most of which deals with python of course. i wish my good good friend michael were online more often :(

      i now have a  urlLink Friend of a Friend  (FOAF) file on my site. you can either use this handy link right here:  urlLink foaf.rdf  ..or you could look at the footer at the very bottom of the page for it along with a contact and atom.xml link. hopefully dashboard will parse both foaf.rdf's and atom.xml's soon! maybe i'll take a look at the rss.xml parsing code for some hints on how to implement parsing of both.

      i got  urlLink nat friedman 's  urlLink dashboard  running today. version 0.5 i believe, running on  urlLink mono  1.0 using  urlLink Beagle  0.0.1. it was a pain in the ass to get the dashboard plugin in  urlLink gaim  though, i had to downgrade to 0.75 since that's what nat's diff patch was for, and i finally figured out after a couple hours that i needed mozilla-nss- devel  and mozilla-nspr- devel  for ssl support in gaim via mozilla nss. yes, it's sad that this didn't come to me in the beginning. it makes sense. damn. anyway, the xchat python plugin was easy to install of course.. the beagle indexer seems to bug out with beagle-index-files though from ~/ ..it'll go through the first directory it finds, then it'll try to index /home/charlie/charlie/thatdirectory, then /home/charlie/charlie/charlie etc.. but dashboard doesn't seem to be getting any results from clues containing parts of the files i indexed [supposedly] successfully.. some rss feeds from  urlLink straw  work when  straw  sends a clue, and it just sends the location of the rss, and dashboard [probably] just takes any rss url and parses it.. and atom support would be nice.. "bug #xxxx" works though from gaim and xchat. and i have no idea how to go about getting evolution to send clues. some patch i guess, hopefully i wouldn't have to recompile it because that would be hell. beagle-index-mail tries to look in a directory that doesn't exist for mail and i'm thinking the evolution userdata directory structure changed since it was made. oh, and dashboard tries to call Beagle.Hit.GetaData(string) which doesn't exist, and, being new to beagle, i don't know what i could change the code to to make it work the same, so i just commented out the only two lines that did that. they were just for photos, and i don't have my digital camera yet, so..  but i'm still having fun with dashboard, and i hope  urlLink ximian  continues steady work on it.

       "We vastly underestimated the Slashdot effect.

      today i did some more messing around with  urlLink python . i made  urlLink a script  that creates  urlLink a list of all of my mp3's . and just so someone doesn't try to sue me,  i own all of the albums that those mp3's came from and i do not distribute them to people who may not own the albums. i find that it is easier to use my computer to listen to the music that i own than to look through numerous discs, so i "ripped" the albums onto my computer. the list is only for my personal reference and, as in this case, for showing off my album collection.   :)  but since no one reads my blog anyway, i probably don't need to say that, but you never know with today's america. corporations seem to love coming up with more and more  urlLink bullshit to nullify our basic rights . if you feel like reading an extremely long reply to an email sent to the  urlLink Electronic Frontier Foundation  asking "what's wrong with copy protection?" then  urlLink click here . this is an html version of the original posting of the emails and doesn't include the funny (imo) reply from "Ron" at the end. again, it's pretty long, but i consider it mandatory reading, so if you're bored, i highly recommend it.

      so today was my first day working at subway. i get there and my manager gives me a (used, unclean) shirt and apron and tells me that she's too busy to teach me anything and i'd have to just try to help. she was the only person there at the time because someone who was supposed to be there at the same time that i was didn't show, or even call in. now, as is well known, any mall is pretty busy on saturday. and today, not only was this one busy, but apparently there was a soccer tournament nearby and one team decided to eat at subway. yeah, all of them. so i ended up working an hour overtime, but i think i did pretty damn good for my first day, and having no idea what to do at first, and for it being so busy, and for us being short on staff. i just know i'll dread working on saturdays from now on.
