						   Li Jia Wei lost. We could almost smell the medal but no. Nothing. What more can I say? I wonder whether I'll get to hear our national anthem during the Olympics in my lifetime. Sigh... No mood to do or say anything now except to go to sleep... Extremely tired from the whole day at the seminar.  Oh yeah. Havnt smoke since I came back from my jog 2 hrs ago. The urge is there alright. But I wont light up for tonight. I promise.  Tomorrow? I'll try.  I WANT TO BE SMOKE FREE!

						   Couldnt believe what I saw when our table tennis player Li Jia Wei crashed out of the semis. She was so bloody bloody close! Imagine leading 3-1 needing only one more game to secure at least a silver. Sad... damm sad. All credit must go to her though... She fought really hard. Made us all proud back at home. Way to go girl! And did I mention she look cute too? Heh! All the best for bronze tomorrow!  Well, quite an uninteresting day. Went for the "Screen Based Trading Strategies" seminar held at Intercontinental Hotel. Cant believe I actually sit from 9am to 5pm listening to that guy talk. The only thing that I like bout being there are the wonderful snacks and buffet lunch. Not forgetting the unlimited servings of coffee and tea. Screen based trading... I think that really signals the end of the road for us. The speaker actually told us only about 20% of the traders who switch from trading on the floor to trading the screens actually made it. That's a comforting figure. Where am I gonna find that edge I've always enjoyed when trading on the floor as compared to trading the screens? One more 8 hour session tomorrow. Let's hope I can find it.

						   Finally installed the electronic trading platform on my PC today. As much as I hate it, I have to learn how to trade electronically now. Open outcry trading is dying a slow and painful death. The future is so uncertain now... I have no god damm idea whether I can be as comfortable doing electronic trading as I trade in an open outcry environment. This is a totally new stuff for me. Everything looks so bloody weird! Why the hell am I doing this??!!!  A girl named Ling Hui from Dell Malaysia called me cause I wanted to purchase some accessories for my pocket PC. Boy! She sounded wonderful! Never heard such a beautiful voice for a long time. Best part is she doesnt sound Malaysian at all! Hhmmm... why am I saying all this? Blah!  And no... I did not manage to cut down on my cigarettes intake at all today. Said I cant do it right? Yeah I know. Big loser.

I've been saying I wanna quit for like 1 gazillion times. Heh! Me? Stop smoking? Hhmmm...  I'm gonna try. No promises. But I'll try.  Wish me luck.

						   I'm floating like a butterfly in my room now. Feeling a bit tipsy from the Erdinger I had at FV with my buddy. The perfect jazz cd playing on my Hitachi now...  As how Diana Krall sang it, "S' Wonderful". The feeling is so damm good!  What I long for now is someone very dear to cuddle to bed... put me to sleep... tuck me into a warm blanket. Too bad there's no one. She's long gone with that bastard. Cuddling with that bastard... tucking that bastard into a warm blanket.  Well, good for her I guess. At least she's happy.  Go to sleep jordan. U still have Mr Skeleton...

						   Bloody cough still there. When is it going to stop??!!!  Sigh, I know... I should really stop smoking so heavily. I think the gruesome pictures printed on the cigarette boxes are beginning to have an effect on me. BUT HOW TO??!!! I dont think I can ever live without it. It's too hard. I've been smoking for the last 10 years now. I just can't imagine myself not having a cigarette in hand when the urge comes. Sigh............ Too tough.  The run yesterday was a total disaster! Managed to run only like half the race. Walk the rest because the stitches I developed is too much for me to take. And I nearly shit the hell out of my pants during the run. No kidding! The crap was like just at the tip of my asshole. Thank god it didnt reach the point of no return. If not I will definitely have to dive into some bushes and let go. Even contemplating of using my number bib for cleaning purposes cause I got no tissues! Maybe I drank too much water before the run. Sigh... Complete disaster!  Big sale from G2000 at my workplace. Bought 3 pairs of pants. No choice, have to buy cause my old pants are like falling off cause it's too damm huge for me now. Damm shop... I need a size 27 but they told me the smallest size they carry is a 28. Duh! What a skinny bastard I am.  Guess what?! My buddy got influence by me and set up a blog of his own. Heh. Check it out at  urlLink http://iandevous.blogspot.com/  !!!

						   Uneventful day... as usual.  Cough the whole day like someone suffering from TB or something. Please let me be well for tomorrow's run...  Today is suppose to be one of our anniversary day. Yeah... every 14th of the month. I wonder what is she doing now. In his arms on the bed maybe?  I miss her parents so much. What could they be doing now? Could the feelings be mutual? I really doubt so. Stop thinking jordan. Stop tormenting yourself......

						   I've caught the virus that's been going around at work. Throat's been feeling funny since yesterday. And it has gotten much worse now. Damm! I'll shoot myself if I cant take part in the 10km run this Sunday at Sentosa.  The steamboat buffet lunch at Ling Zhi this afternoon was fantastic! The soup was really tok kong! Thanks to JKR for bringing me and EDO there. Though it would be way much better if I wont have to come out a single cent. Heh!  Plenty of rest jordan. Plenty of rest...

						   Been trying for hours to add an audio clip to my page but I just cant!!! Tried the audio blogger thing but i have to call or something to record? HUH??? Tried some free music hosting websites and when everything seems fine i get shit loads of error messages from this website. FUCK! Can someone help?   Registered for the half marathon coming up in December at Standard Chartered Bank today. I cant believe I'm going to run a half marathon!!! Just 2 months ago I passed my first IPPT in 6 years after my ORD. I even managed to get a silver! HAH! And now... I'm going for my first ever half marathon. Unbelievable! Who knows? I might complete the full course next year!   I guess that's what depression arising from a failed marriage does to you... u lose 15 kilos in 6 months. And then u can run! Good thing? Bad thing? I really dunno...
