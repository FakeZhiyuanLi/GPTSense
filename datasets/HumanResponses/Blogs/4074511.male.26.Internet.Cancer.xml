      It's just been one of those typical day's, I work at an ISP so (Customers Suck). Hearing the phone ring at 5 minutes after 9:00 stinks.&nbsp;To top it off I am a miserable person in the morning. I answer the phone every morning, good afternoon and one out of every three people have to ask sarcastic(Is it really afternoon).&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes it difficult&nbsp;to not&nbsp;want to throw things across the room. Then the phone rings off the hook for the next half hour, so by the time my other coworkers get here IM already beat for the day.   I&nbsp;am part owner of a video game parlor which is in the same office space as the ISP. Let me tell you, watching my system admin&nbsp; try to play DDR is awesome. He is 27 years old and has that office workers build . :-) That is usually one of the first laughs you will see out&nbsp; of me in the morning. The only thing that is more funny is watching one of my tech's walk down the stairs still half asleep. He stayed too long playing video games the night before so he decided it would be easier to sleep on a couple of beanbag chairs upstairs. He will come down the stairs and say three words(I'm going home). Why he does that to himself, I really don't know.   I guess the last thing I have to say today is, Enigma if you are not going to tell a lot of personal stuff about yourself then why did you write the first Blog? :-) LOL   &nbsp;

      Well most of the day is through and it went exactly how I expected. The air conditioning is fixed so no more water through the walls and most of the customers are taken care of for the day. That means I'll have to fix the same customers problems tomorrow, woohoo. It's almost like they have a button they push  to put it back exactly like it was the day before, (thats got to be it). The system admin is sitting in the back doing who knows what (probably working) :-). Mike (my boss) and I are sitting writing up our blog's. The big Boss left so no more creating fake work for myself to amuse him.  It may not seem like it but I do like being at work, it's not all bad. I just find it to be a lot easier to talk about the bad stuff that happens rather than the good. Let's see here what good happened today. Hmmmmmmmmmm, oh yea I got payed. I can't wait until this day ends, tomorrow will be better , I can feel it. I can go home and relax for a little while, Maybe play some rainbow six 3 or Final Fantasy XI. If it would ever stop raining I would do something useful outside my house, like wash the cars or clean out my shed.  that's about it for the day, Mr. Blanks just walked in and I know he is going to play rainbow.

      So I came into work today and of course it is the first day of the week and the second day of the month. First thing that happens is the phone rings off the hook (of course). Just so everyone knows when you have 2000 customers to answer tech support for only ten of them will ever call. Well it started, I was already hearing the same names I did the month before and the month before that. It's just funny how irritating that gets.  After the blast of phone calls I got started using the steam cleaner to suck up the water (yes water) that was seeping through the wall. Apparently redundant backups don't always work. Our main air conditioner was not draining the condensation where it was suppose to. Instead, it was sending directly into our neighbors office then under the wall to ours.  Now starts the normal day. My system admin stepped out for a few. The Big Boss is in and I am trying to make myself look busy while he is. That is why IM typing this, to him I am working hard not hardly working. Oh well, I'll probably post again today when something more interesting happens
