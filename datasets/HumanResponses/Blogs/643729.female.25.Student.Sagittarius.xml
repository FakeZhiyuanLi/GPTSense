      So i got this message on my cell phone this morning at about 9-930 from a 911 dispatcher asking me to tell my children to please stop calling there and reporting false emergencies that they had called 7 times in a 1/2 hr period.  I told the guy my kids were at their dad's.....my cell was dead...and at that time had been locked in my car all night!  And to be quite honest, that I was still asleep myself.  So for some reason they have my cell # as having called all those times.  The funny part is there were recordings that I listened to and I told the guy...well you definately have the wrong place because one call sounded like it was from a kid who was black and the other was from a little girl about 3 or so.  So now I am bugged b/c for some reason whoever called was logged as comming from my cell phone.  At the 8am-930am window when those calls were made my cell was dead beyond dead and locked in my car.  Like, dead to the point you couldn't even get it to power up.  So I called AT&T and talked to them about it.  However, I am no further in the understanding of what happened except for the fact that it was not a mix up through them.  So now I don't know what the hell happened.  They can't press any charges though and they even admitted that when they called back to make sure everything was ok, which was when the message got left, it went rigth to my voicemail.  Dugh morons!  Obviously that means the phone is powered off!!  So that was my exciting day.  Well, that and going grocery shopping with all three kids.  Geez was that fun, let me tell you!?!  So anyway gonna go for now!  TTFN B

      Well today was quasi-uneventful.  We all got up, kids (Lex and Nic, who else?) covered themselves in baby power (requiring a quick shower before leaving w/ Tom at 3ish).  Shane and I hit the Hostess/Wonder and Entemans outlet shops then headed to my mom's.  On the way there she called asking if I could pull over on the side of the road somewhere and find her cattails as a gag gift for the musical they were doing that night.  I wound up at Verchio's (a wholesale produce stand) looking to see if I could find any there.  Well $25 on fruit and veggies later alas, no cattails.  Got to my mom's and my sister, Krista, was on her way home with some.  Hung out there for a while till my sister came home.  She was scheduled to watch my son Shane while I went and saw the musical my mom and sister, Jaclynne, were involved in.  Went to the musical and oh my god.  Now keeping in mind that i was watching a theatre group of kids ages 8-16, I tried to not be too critical.  I couldn't understand a thing they were saying, the kids that needed volume (mics) didn't have 'em and the kids that didn't need them had 'em.  Costumes were awesome (great job as usual Mom!!) and all the stage and set parts were perfect (Jac is the best!!)  but after saying that, I want the 2 hours of my life back!!  There was so much left to be desired with the coreography and the blocking was alittle awkward at times.  I know what to expect from kids, but I didn't get nearly what I thought that group should have done.  Oh well!!  So that was my exciting day and night.  TTFN B

      Got up early to take kids to school so I could go to head shrinking apt.  Picked up Maddy on the way, I had told Kris I would bbsit her since her usual sitter was on vaca again.  Everyone at the office thought she was absolutely adorable.  Appt went well.  I am now on a mission to set boundaries in my life with the ppl, typically men, who walk all over me.  So watch out Alan, Tom, and Angel to name a few.  Not that you are bad people, but in some way, shape, or form you cross boundaries that I need to put into place.  Boundaries that have effected me enough to talk to my therapist about, which indicates that I am uncomfortable with them.  Went and picked up Shane from school and met his OT at the house.  Went to my mom's for lunch and nap time.  It was nice because I got to lay down with the kids and take a nap myself.  Picked up Lex and Nic and went to the grocery store for some light shopping.  Milk, eggs, that kinda stuff.  Then came home and watched some T.V. with them.  We all are going to sleep in my bed.  Not a very eventful day except for the therapy.  I did talk to Alan about the weekend plans for a visit but they fell through and nothing happened.  Oh well, his loss not ours!   TTFN B

      There isn't enough medication in the world to help handle the day I had. Some of it was good, but alot of it was bad, real bad. We all woke up and everything was going ok. Shane came in when he got up (around 7am) nand snuggled in bed with me after asking to have Blue's Clues put on. Now keep in mind when I first wake up in the morning my eyes are stuck shut because of weeping due to allergies. I have memorized the remote and the keystrokes required to get to said show so I am ok. So we watched B.C. then found Noggin (one of the best kids networks on cable T.V.) and were watching that. Actully let me be honest, Shane was watching, I was listening! Then it becomes about that time to get up and out of bed and face the day. We all get dressed and ready to head out the door to school. "Where are my keys?" I ask. No response. "WHERE ARE MY KEYS?!?" Then I get the famous, "I didn't have em. Nic/Alexys/Shane had them." Now the name blamed depends on who I ask. "Well, FIND MY KEYS!!" I yell. It then becomes obvious that we are not going tomake it to school today because the couch monster has swallowed my keys. I send Shane in for a nap, and instruct Alexys and Nic to keep looking. They are finally found in a basket of folded clothes destined for Nic's room. By then it is too late to go to shcool and I am getting hungry. We have lunch and get the rest of the clean clothes sorted and folded. I was at least productive today!! Cut to us, 7 hours later trying to leave and go to the laundry mat. Same senario only this time my wallet has disappeared as well. GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRR. Kids! We find them relatively quickly this time and off the the mat we go. Utter and total chaos there. Kids running, spinning each other in the baskets/rolling carts, buying 7 cans of soda after they sneak into my wallett and get the change I just got for the machines. We got it done and came home and here I sit recalling my day. I did have a good conversation with Jo. She is my youngest son's aunt. Thank god she is a part of our lives again. I love talkign to her and hearing about all the madness over at the donor's house. Makes me feel good about that fact there they have had no influence until recently. Well, off to call my best friend, Dale, and watch newlyweds. I hope I didn't miss it!  TTFN B

      I went to class like a good girl!  Paid attention like a good girl!  That was after my mom called a few times asking me to stop by and pick up this Little Tykes house that the neighbor around the corner was throwing away.  She wanted me to carry/drag it around the corner to her house.  Why is it that my mom has surgery and becomes unable to do anything yet she starts making all kinds of plans for anyone in the direct path of her eyesight!  She cracks me up! So anyway, after class I went to see Spiderman 2.  I had previously attempted to see it with the donor, Damien, and Shane but as usual, Shane's attention span of 45 minutes was eaten up pretty quickly.  Why do they put 20 minutes of commercials in front of movies?  And I honestly do mean commercials!  Car ads and internet ads and such.  So I was in the theater watching the movie nad doesn't some ignorant ass bitch take 4 frigging cell phone calls during the movie.  She didn't just hit silent or send the calls to voicemail, she answered them and talked for a few seconds to a few minutes.  GGGGGGGGRRRRRRRR.  Then on the way home, I stopped at the Village for some back to school shopping for Lex.  Five out of the six times I have been there this asshole has been out front begging for change to "go get a burger for him and his son".  If he went and found a job and worked at it as hard as he works at begging for change everyday, he'd have money for whatever he needs.  I have officially declared to anyone who will listen that I am trading in my Saturn for a Sea-Doo.  (Jet ski!)  Just about everyday for the past week when I go to pick up the kids from school it is pouring rain outside.   I am going to start wearing my bathing suit to go get them.  Well, my eyes are once again cloudy fomr allergies, so I am goign to go for now.   TTFN B
