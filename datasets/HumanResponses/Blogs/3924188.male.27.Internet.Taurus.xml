       I found myself accepting an impromptu invitation go out to the pub last night, and what a blast it was too.    We all started off in the Hogs Head on Beverley road in Hull. 3 pints of stella artois and numerous games of pool with some ladies made a great start to the evening and then off to the welly club it was.    I was told that  urlLink Har Mar superstar  was going to be playing and sure he was. If you don't know who Har Mar is, he is a short balding guy not to dissimilar to the infamous Ron Jeremy. Part of his act is to sweat so much that he has to take all his clothes off. Luckily for me, as I was in the 3rd row, he kept his Y-fronts on.    His songs are on par with  urlLink Tenacious D  and  urlLink spinal tap , mostly about sex. He's a funny guy and well worth watching if you get the chance, there are UK tour dates on his website.    I managed to get a few good pics with the camera on my phone and when I get the Bluetooth dongle back from home I will post them up here.

       I have finally managed to find a pic of myself from the Summer bash snowboarding Par-ty. The pic shows me in the early stages of going for a nose grab.

        "Her inclination to hiss at dogs and devour canned fish, as well as an insatiable urge to bury her face in catnip, eventually convince her that something is going on."   Comic book characters are always difficult when removed from their familiar surrounding of a  paper and pen on the celluloid and special effects.  Past bloopers such a Batman and Robin, The Punisher (the Dolph Lungren Version) and The Hulk may make many believe it is not possible. However, such greats as Blade, and X-men show that with a bit of care it can be done.  Sadly despite Hale Berry looking fantastic as usual 'Catwomen' will be lost in the bargain bin of video rental stores across the world until a worthy suitor can be found.   urlLink The BBC review can be found here

       I have just heard that my interview that was going to be held tomorrow morning has been postponed until next week. The reason for this postponement is due to an update to their  CMS  which they need to evaluate before making an appointment.  Normally this would possibly aggrevate me but as I am yet to finish swotting up on ASP and VBScript and finish my 15 minute presentation. The update gives me a stay of execution , certainly enough time to knock up a kick ass presentation.

       I have an Interview for a new job on Thursday at the Yorkshire Tourist Board as their new webmaster. Not only do I have to sit a skills assessment on ASP, VBscript and SQL I also have to produce a presentation on future development for the site in line with their 2005 marketing campaign, which I know nothing about.  Normally I wouldn't worry but I only got the details last thing yesterday giving me 2 days  to knock up the presentation and brush up on my ASP and VB knowledge. Fun. Thankfully all the other applicants will also have the same time scale.  I now have to surreptitiously do the presentation whilst at work today which is not easy considering that my monitor faces my bosses desk!  Anyhoo, will let you all know how it goes.

       This  urlLink news item  made me a tad miffed today as I would have joined up in a jiffy to get my hands on a free xbox.     Living in Hull means that I can only get the internet offers available from  urlLink Kingston Communications , our benevolent phone company.

       Its Friday and I finish work in 30 mins. So possible one of the better times to avoid doing any work and post here.      With it being friday I have been to the pub for lunch, and very nice it was to. Cottage Pie with all the trimmings and drinkto wash it down with. Amazingly I found myself hungry after that and opted for the healthy option of an apple to keep me going until the gym tonight.     My weekend will consist of shopping on Saturday for birthday presents and new trainers. I am split between these very cool Etnie lo-cut 2's      and these Van Rowley XLT's     and then possibly cleaning my car, possibly.     Saturday evening be BBQ/takeout night depending on the weather, but its looking good. I expect that the evening will include some PS2 gaming action in the form of Pro EVo 3 most definalty the best footy game.... in the world....ever....vol1.     Sunday I find myself playing host to my DIY guru parents and hope to have two new interior doors put up and some grouting done in the kitchen. Hazaaa!

       After a weekend of excess I have finally managed to recover. Yes, it took two days. My weekend started on Friday morning but still found myself in work for the first few hours (see below) shortly after lunch I headed off for the tropical delight that is Tamworth.     After a few hours sat on various M roads I made it too the camp site. Driving down the dirt track I round a corner to see 3 or 4 guys in camo gear and 15 foot flags proclaiming them to be the 51st Airbourne unit, Some how I doubt these rotund individual actually made it into any armed forces. I drive by...Slowly.     Around the next bend is the camp site so I pitch up my tent and start on the beer. It is 5.30pm. As the evening draws near more and more people turn up and follow my lead Tent Beer. A gas BBQ is in full swing and defrosted meats from around the country all converge to feed our hunger.     The plan for the weekend consists of paintballing at 9.30am Saturday morning, back for a BBQ and then head of the Tamworth snodome to board from 9.30pm - 1.30am Sunday morning. Despite out early start we carry on drinking until the wee hours of the morning. I finally give in at around 5am and head off to bed.     3 hours later the alarm on my phone that I some how managed to set, and still do not remember doing, is ringing akin to Big Ben. I haul myself out of tent YAY the BBQ is already lit and a burger is waiting for me. Call it fate, coincidence or pure luck I just call it breakfast :)     Paintball was excellent. Separated into two teams purple and orange our first mission was to grab two artifacts from a temple and run through the oppositions gate.   The whistle goes. 3 fire teams head out 1 central 1 left and 1 defense, my team. The central fire team die in hail of paint, and a few screams. But not before securing both artifacts. From my defense position I can see two oranges pinned down but hoping to snatch the artifacts. I move forward. Good use of cover sheilds me from their view. The artifacts are now 2 feet from me. I have been seen. Now I am pinned downed two against one. I pop my head out to zero in on their positions. With a lucky shot I take out one and with a hail of covering fire at the 2nd I run a grab the artifacts. The stewards scream out "Artifacts in play, orange team needs to do something"     Now all that survive are the left fire team and myself. I work my way around to their position ducking paint balls as I go. Now only 10 feet from the gate, I see two oranges defending. I have to pass them at point blank range to win. My colleagues lay down some suppressing fire, enough to get me with 5 feet of the gate. My heart is racing. Paint balls ping off the sides of the pillar am using for cover. They know I am there. I spot a chink in their armour. They repeatedly pop out fire 4 rounds and then hide again. Years of  FPS  training has taught me find the weakness and exploit. Instinctively I rush them.. As I pass the gate time slows. I fire off rounds hearing each pulse of gas as it propels the paintball towards my foe, spinning as I go to avoid being hit. "aarrgghh" I hear a scream. 3 shot found their target. Two in the thigh one in the chest. I have one the game.   My team mates jump and shout in victory. Game 1 to Purple team.      Purple team also wins game two quite convincingly I manage two confirmed kills before the substitute hollow point rips the back out of my left calf muscle. Lucky for me it is only yellow paint. With Orange team now loosing 6 points to 1 the third game is stacked in their favour and we have a lot to do. Again I rack up another 2 kills but with my team dying rapidly I am soon out numbered 4 to 1 and can only hold them back with retreating fire for a short while until I have my right arm blown off at the bicep. Green paint drips from my arm. With extra points for holding positions in a helicopter orange team pull it back to within 2 points.   Purple team needs to win or draw the 4th and final game to win the day. Enter the wild wild west, a very cool layout of saloons and a grand canyon. The whilst is blown for the final game and we rush out to sack the town. I soon get pinned down in the grave yard and my 1 man support receives a head shot before taking two in the chest. I am on my own. Thinking that the oranges have moved I rush towards some better cover only to be picked off just before I reach it. very fucked off I fire 3 shots into the nearest wall. No kills for me. After 10 more minutes of play our last 3 guys storm the saloon kill that last of the oranges and we win the game and the day. "Whoyaa".     After much debating on who shoot who etc we made out way back to campsite to recover have yet more BBQ and beer and head for a night of snowboarding. Hitting the kickers all night a quickly session on the gas pipe rail see's the 4 hours of slope time fly buy whilst a number of campers just get pissed in the bar, I have to drive.     2am and we are all back at the camp site and in an attempt to catch out I hit a home made bong made from B&amp;Q drain pipes, this thing has to been seen to be believed. Despite sucking on that bong like it was going out of fashion I still wasn't as wasted as most. Again the sun starts to come up and this is my cue to hit the sack. I am awakened an hour later by people kicking my tent "stop fucking snoring", "fuck off" I reply and drift back off to sleep, only to wake up a few hours later.     After a hearty breakfast of pringles and water everybody slowly packs up their stuff, cleans up the field and says their goodbye's. I now have a 3 hour car journey back. This doesn't start too well as I almost get run off the road by fucking caravan, he would have seen me if he used his fucking mirrors. I decide to catch to some more sleep at the next service station. 26 miles, arse! I finally get there and catch 45 mins of much needed sleep.   I get home pretty damn exhausted and crash out on the sofa only to fall asleep watching Alien 4: resurrection. I wake up, restart alien and fall asleep again this happens three more times before I actually see the film all the way through. At the end I give in and go to bed, Monday is going to hurt and it does.

       Having managed to drag myself away from the work desk I find myself yet again at a PC with a net connection.    Due to spending way too much time at work I have only ever felt the need to use net during work hours which, like now, prompts me with the problem of how to get online when I have a day off or at weekends. Normally not having access to the net at home does not bother me as stuff can always wait, but not this time. So what do I do?    From the hazy memory I have of driving to work each morning, I recall seeing "the hub". Yet another cyber cafe that I assume, like all the others, will go the way of the dodo. Luckily for me this prophecy has not come true...Yet.    I now have nine minutes left.    My first impression was of surprise, on two counts. The first in that it actually looks like a nice place to have coffee. It has comfy sofa's, Bean bags, chess and an excellent LCD TV hanging on the wall to my right, sadly it is showing the golf but even this does not detract from its coolness.    The second surprise is that upon my request to scan "stuff" I get "no problem" in return and with in 2 minutes it is all done. Now I can surf and e-mail for the 30 minutes I have paid for at a bargain £1.50.    Having sat here for almost 30 mins (Just 3 to go) I have seen a myriad of clientele walk in through the doors, notably an attractive brunette who has now been replaced by a balding 40 something, not so notable.    my time is flashing so this will be edited later......

       Despite having booked the day of work I have managed to find myself at work and behind my desk, but I wont be here for long, I hope.     A bit of quick internet browsing can reveal some interesting sites. Such as the  urlLink death to Moore forum .  As you can guess these guys are not fully paid up members of Michael Moore's fan club.     After a browse of some of the threads it is easy to summarize their opinions as "Moore is a dumb ass" and such quality lines as "Moore is a trador" lol have a read I am amazed that such closed minds actually found the internet instead of burning it.     Overall the most hilarious thing about the whole forum is the continued denouncing of what Moore has said and stands for and that he should not be able to flex his right to free speech and criticize the government whilst voicing their views to the entire world. I might have posted a reply about the irony of the site but I doubt that they would understand.

       Not a new form of rock ,paper, scissor as you might think but a great web browser game, if it can be called that.   urlLink The nation state  is a website that allows you to setup your own nation and dictate its laws and politics. If you choose to you can become a power wielding dictator oppressing your people with a police state and high taxes or run a benevolent republic ensuring that all your denizens have a Utopian life style , the choice is yours.  The idea came from Max Barry, the author of  Jennifer Government . When setting up your nation state you can choose the type of government, the name, (but this may take some time to find one that has not already been taken) design your own flag, choose currency and national animal.  Each day you are presented with 1 issue that your government needs to address, this can be changed to two if like me you feel the need to have more daily input.  Your not alone!, to ensure that at least some of the nation states adhere to international law the game includes a virtual  Nations">UN . This Virtual Organisation holds debates and sets laws on issues from Human Rights to correct spelling, all of which must be adhered to if you wish the join the  Nations">UN , but not all do. As an alternative to the UN you can join or indeed set up a coalition with other nation states.  Overall it's a clever idea that is possibly no more than a quick diversion from work, But for Max Barry it a clever way to advertise your new book.  Have a look at my nation state  urlLink here

       The new design of the site is up...but not finished, My next task is to knock up a suitable graphic for the header, dull grey is just not inspireing. I also want to put some colour or images at the bottom in the footer but hat can wait a bit.  In time the look may change again as the layout is modified from the original tictac design. I already have ideas on what to do. A possible third column or a floating picture window. As allways these will depend on IE's ability to adhere to W3C's standards on  CSS  and  HTML .  Anyhoo, this is my first post via e-mail and will be intersted in seeing if it all comes out ok *fingers crossed*.  TC

       Wow!, two posts in one day! This may give hope that I will indeed keep this blog up to date but this a possibility that has a diminishing chance of success.  This post is just to decree that: " I here by advise that at some point will change the look of this blog"*   *disclaimer: No dates will be given to a) avoid disappointment and b)give me plenty of time to get around to doing it.

       Despite being aware of blogs since their infancy I have never felt the need to add my 2 pence worth to the increasingly vast amount of information available on the Interweb. Why the change of mind?  A simple answer would be "Having nothing better to do" but that is untrue as I could be doing many things with my time, one would be setting up the newly released  urlLink php5  on my development server. Yes I am yet another web monkey forcing my views and rants on the world wide web.  A complex answer may involve some deep psychological analysis of a narcissistic cyber-personality, but that would take  way  too long.  The real answer, because my  urlLink mate  has one :D  Anyway enjoy reading my blog and I apologise for any typo's (for which I am renowned)
