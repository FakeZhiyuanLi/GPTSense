       Listening to: Yngwie Malmsteen   Today I completed the penultimate exam (History), which was nice, and filmed a series of sketches with Tromboner Hollingworth (owner of mrpwase.blogspot.com), which was great fun. Hopefully, I'll get them up on this site, but the likelihood of that is...well, next to nought. Ie. not happenin', biatch. If you  really  want to see them then you'll have to find and ask me nicely.  As the title suggested, The Mighty Boosh is something I find to be fantastic. BBC3 around 8pm with repeats on around 1pm - random days. It's something verging on Monty Python - it has a couple of crappier moments, but most is "class" (said like cl-ass). It's slightly story driven, but includes sketches mixed into the madness. Unfortunately, it could be a little too surreal for some...   Like this "special" lady:

       Listening to: Blind Guardian   Fast approaching (Friday, to be precise), we have our very last GCSE, providing no-one wants to re-do them. Of course, this provides us with a good excuse to make a mess and annoy people as a party, so such an event will be going on in the hallowed grounds of..."Muzzy's" house. But only for persons with invites, fool.  Less of the cordial invitations, and more handy titbits of information/pictures for you to peruse.   Enjoy!       This is big in Japan - it's called Cosplay. Others prefer gay, or cross dressers. No, the one on the right  is , in fact, a woman.        Sorry, is that.....Mr. Richards?   'Nuff said.

       Listening to: Slayer - Seasons In the Abyss   So England won, eh? 3-0? Like I said then, and so did big ol' round ol' Des Lynam - I should get in touch. Having completed all but 3 exams (Physics, History: Medicine and Statistics), thoughts turn to the 9 1/2 weeks holiday (that piqued your interest) that follows. Black Ice plan to write (and record) most of an album, if not all of one, do a screenplay or two (re-filming The Yakuza Missions, Brave Brave Sir Robin and another we're yet to write) and perhaps even playing a gig. Just for you. An everyone else. The record will probably be released on Subtitle records (our own brand) unless someone with more money (we're looking at you, Weez) wants to help out.  On a more flatulent note, I'm-a purchasing a new guitar in the near future. Now, I'm choosing between the new Minarik Inferno ( urlLink minarikguitars.com ) and the almighty Gibson Les Paul (you know what they are). Unfortunately for Minarik, it only takes one gimp in a gimp mask and a gimp suit to play one gimpy "song" on Top of the Pops and I'll never want to take my Inferno out again, so the LP is looking the favourite by far (no it won't be a crappier Epiphone model, either).   Here's a pic.

       Listening to: Faith No More   Having saved a good five-hours work on the new song at school, I decided it would be best if I left the disk behind/lose it.  The sharper amongst you (that's you out Miles), may have realised that I hadn't done this on purpose, but I can only assume it was A LAPSE. Fortunately, the disk should still be there, but failing that, I still have a copy on the network...Malheuresment, it means I couldn't practise the relatively intricate solo or new parts that I had worked on. Naturally, I'm miffed.   I also took a French reading exam today, where we had to read. ...French.    But enough about me, let's talk about me...   My bedroom has by far the best view in the house. It faces...several directions, all of which look into fields and pastures of greenery. But I don't open my curtains. Hilarious for you maybe, and perhaps also for me, but I blame the damn sunlight. It's too...bright. It's all light yellows and white, but all I want is the glowing warmth and warming glow that my lights give - they're orange, with dimmers.  I've also got an en-suite (been polishing up my French) bathroom, and while it's lov-er-ly, it's completely beyond me why they make shaving plugs with two insy-weensy little holes, that plugs ALWAYS fall out of, and the guy (is it a guy) next the them saying, "Only for Shavers" (which everyone blatently ignores) who looks frickin' nothing like anyone! Ever.  While sockets get me excited, they more than likely don't for you. Plus there are more important things to discuss...like Black Ice's practise tomorrow...and maybe England vs. Switzerland. I predict a 3-0 whomp for England.  jalopy out.

       Listening to: Iron Maiden - Everything   Took Maths and History, as aforementioned, while wearing my contact lenses. Which was different... mostly because I hadn't taken those two papers before. You live, you learn. Occasionally.  Thursday includes much practising of Black Ice, and hopefully will involve the two members who altogether have been to one practise, but only because they're new. wednesday will just be me and my chum Sibelius writing music for Thursday and also a French reading exam.   Just so you hear it here first, England will be knocked out of Euro 2004 in the group stages (ie., the ones they're in now, boyo).   On to business...   If you've ever been to Allsports (a clothes and sporting equipment store), I'm sure you will have noticed, as I have, that there is a person (usually a bloke in his early 20s) standing at the door, waiting for people to come in.  "Yawroight, moite? Can oi 'elp ya?" *Tilts head to left and waggles eyebrow* "Y'what?" comes the usual response. "Oi sed, kin oi 'elp you wid sommit? Eh?" *repeat phase two* "That's a fiver, moite." *Takes your money* "What the hell?" *You look used, bemused and a little confused...in more ways than one!*  And before you know it, the guys taken you inside, taken your money, and given you half a receipt and a mini American football. And all you wanted to do was go to the caf√© opposite.  That guy must make a mint.

       Listening to: DragonForce - Valley of the Damned   Finished a Chemistry and English exam today in my usual exhuberent way, just like Jonny Cash. Also, in a non-Hollingworth way, I did other things too, like revise for tomorrow's Maths II and History I paper...  On another note, the album's coming along fine (for Black Ice), but we're not sure whether we'll be ready for the KES concert...  Jalopy out.

      I'm from Warwickshire, England - your house, to be precise. From now on I'll be known as either crembledebum or jalopy, and I'm in a very important up-'n'-coming band that is doing...lots. If YOU want to help "break the boundries of speed/melodic/power metal," then feel free to email me (at crembledebum@hotmail.com) and be told to get the hell away from my inbox. Cheers,  Honda Jalopy (just to confuse you).
