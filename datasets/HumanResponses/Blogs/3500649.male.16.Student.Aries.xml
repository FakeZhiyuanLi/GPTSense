      I am a miserable 16-year-old boy who is falling in luv with sasi since 2001. It sounds typical right? A luv B but B doesn't know the existance of A. Well, this is an unusual case coz i am a  gay . That's right. He just ignorant of a boy who is tailing (perhaps peeping is the better word) him & can't stop thinking about his warm beam, intelligent stare, handsome look, gaunt yet impeccable figure........ Let me unveil the another twist-he ia an indian apparently, but i am a chinese! Don't give me a repulsive look & think that i am nuts coz u don't understand the pleasure of being a secret admirer of this cute youngster. i love him 4 ever!!!!! If u see this sasi, pls be acknowledged that somewhere, there is a stranger who cares ad cherishs u. perhaps u r clueless of my identity, but i hope 1 day, we can be friends.

      Today is school open day. Amid anxiety, I am looking forward to encounter his parent. The coincidence happened twice. When I got down the stairs 2 phone my dad, I met Sasi and his dad. Well, a bit shocked, for Sasi’s dad wasn’t handsome at all. What the hell is genetics work –Sasi just doesn’t inherit a piece of appearance from his dad. As I wait at the gate 4 my dad, once again, I saw him. His dad was talking to a friend & I overheard a fragment of their conversation. He wasn’t really happy at Sasi’s result. On the other hand, Sasi bade a polite greeting 2 that auntie. ( I hate that – being polite to your friend’s mums & earn their favours? )

      I was surprised 2 see Sasi playing badminton with his friend, Shaun. It occurred 2 me that I also have PJ on Wednesday. Sasi wasn’t good in sport (rather 2 my relief) & he sux in that game. Yet, he was enjoying himself & I could see him smiling from afar. He looks like a baby who cares nothing about other people’s comment. I wish I was him.

      I want 2 concentrate on my studies since the Q had over. But I can’t restrain my jealousy since my friends will & may participate in other Qs that look promising. I beg 4 god’s power- pls don’t turn me into a green-eyed monster. By the way, I have always been jealous about Sasi’s countless achievements (he is an excellent student). & this encourage me 2 work hard 2 outshine him (still, he is better than I am) & also , 2 attract his attraction to make him acknowledged of my existence (I don’t want 2 be a nobody in his eyes) . However, I did sth surprising, I ask teacher not 2 announce my achievement during the following school assembly 4 I felt my feat shouldn’t be earning 2 much compliments, & also I am afraid of go up the stage (although it is a glamorous moment) & thirdly, I think I should learn to “let go”- fame, arrogance, attention, & of course Sasi. I am tired of proving my ability 2 Sasi. I savour the love I have 4 him, & deep inside my heart I want him 2 know that, but, I knew that’s not going 2 happen… so I’ll just love him from the distance. 2 sum it all up, I sincerely hope that I can put my studies as the priority & ignore the loving matter. Keep me from distraction. I hope 1 day, I can find a girl that I like & lead a blissful life with her.

      Let’s talk about sasi’ brother-Kavidaran. Although he is short (actually, short earns my favour) & definitely not as handsome as his brother, still, I cast an eye on him coz he resembles the boy I love. & gradually, I find that he is cute too. Alright, I like him 2!

      Attention 2 everyone. I have found my new target. He is Shaun Quah Wee Kiat, good friend of Sasidaran. I admit that I never found him as attractive as Sasi until he came 2 talk 2 me a few days ago. That trivial conversation Had broken the ice & melted my indifferent heart. He is different from Sasi. Sasi makes my heart beat with high velocity but Shaun gives me the impression of warmth and ease. I am comfortable talking 2 him & yearn 4 his friendship. Although I know our friendship only endure 4 a few days (coz he will forget about me very soon ) but 1 thing 4 sure, I ‘ll regard him as my friend 4ever. The moment I share with him (though it was just merely a few minutes ) will I treasure forever. Shaun Quah, I love u & friendship forever.
