      one weekend lost to a con in new york city -- though i did have lunch at an indian buffet there i chose not to review it. indeed, it would be almost insulting to have only one buffet reviewed in such a massive city. while i could never live there, i challenge someone who does to take on the task i have taken on in boston ... reviewing every indian buffet in the city! good luck! more next week!

    India Castle    
   Region   Cambridge (between Harvard & Central)  
   Address   928 Mass Ave.  
   Phone   617-864-8100  
   Web    www.indiacastle.com   
   Price   $6.95  
   Buffet Hours   11:30am-3:30pm daily  
   Payment options   cash, credit card  
   Ambience & Presentation   very modern dining area, tastefully decorated and well lit. the buffet was well presented on an arced bar with not only labels but explanations of what is in the food. great for those who don't know what they're getting.  
   i stumbled across this place by accident, walking down mass ave between central and harvard squares. although it was dinnertime when i first passed it, the buffet table caught my eye. gleaming domed pans arced around a semicircular bar in the middle of the dining room, it is modern almost to the point of being futuristic, but, as i later found out, the food is well in touch with tradition.  my visit began with a small disappointment, as i noticed that the buffet was lacking one all-important element -- the  naan . but i piled high my plate and prepared for the food to make up for the lack of bread. then, just as i was halfway through one very hot but well spiced  samosa  which had just been delivered to the buffet as i walked in, a waitress brought a basket with an entire naan in it. not only do they freshly bake the naan for each table, it is without question the best naan i have ever tasted. although it was plain, it was a shame to have to use such an excellent bread merely to soak up leftover sauces. of course, when i was done, i had saved a quarter in my bag to munch on later in the day.  the  rice  had the usual seasonings but added asafoetida for an extra flavor i was not expecting. the  dal  was also flavored differently, less gingery and with more cumin seed than usual. although i avoided the aloo gobhi (cauliflower again), i was pleased to see a different chickpea dish --  chole masala . this dish had a pleasant balance between a mild sweetness on the first taste and an unexpected little afterburn. the chicken dishes were the undisputed champions in this buffet, however. the  tandoori chicken  had a very smoky flavor but retained its moisture well. the onions it was sitting with had also absorbed some of this smoky flavor, which made for an interesting combination of tastes. the  chicken tikka masala  was quite excellent -- the chicken was cooked to just the degree where it flakes apart when you stick a fork in, and the sauce had much more texture than usual -- at one point i found a slivered almond. the dessert was kheer, again, which i avoided as usual. when, oh when, will someone put ras malai on the buffet?   
   Absolute Rating   one of the better and fresher experiences in recent memory. also, only a short walk from either harvard or central square.  8/10

   Address   380 Moody St.  
   Phone   781-893-9500  
   Web    www.jewelwaltham.com   
   Price   $9.95 lunch; $13.95 dinner buffet.  
   Buffet Hours   11:30am - 2:30pm; 6-9pm for saturday dinner buffet.  
   Payment options   cash, check, credit card (over $10 only)  
   Ambience & Presentation   Opulent but accessible -- mock crystal chandeliers and a fountain in the entryway look like they might be more at home in a chinese restaurant. the door has this incredibly annoying "welcome to jewel of india" recording that plays whenever it's opened (fortunately, you can't hear it from the seating area). music is modern indian pop, but not bhangra. the buffet in this place is larger than most, which is good if you're either picky or interested in trying new things. also, there were pitchers of water on every table, which is either convenient or lazy or both.  
   i feel i must preface this by saying that i have eaten here twice before, and never been overly impressed. i had grown fond of saying that Jewel was the worst indian restaurant in Waltham, and the second-worst buffet. suffice it to say, this visit changed my mind. although its ranking has not changed in my hierarchy of Waltham indian restaurants, it is now the "third best" instead of the "second worst" and while i may not choose it over other area restaurants as often, i will not put it down again.  the first distinction i noticed was that they had a stack of  pappadams , which is unusual for buffets for some reason. this was a plus and they were very good. the  naan  was of the aloo persuasion, which was a nice departure from the plain naan i have had recently. it was not noticeably more flavorful than plain naan, but i appreciate the effort put into making it different from usual. the  samosas  were a little small, slightly tough, but very pleasantly gingery inside. not the best i've had, but not the worst by any stretch of the imagination.  the  saag paneer  was very flavorful with just the slightest afterburn, although it was a bit short on the paneer. the  chicken curry , while excellently spiced, was a little less than warm and the chicken was a little dry -- the same went for the  tandoori chicken , which was not only a little dry but more reminiscent in flavor of a middle-america backyard barbecue than a tandoor. the  lamb curry  was tender and flavorful but a little fatty for my taste. in the  channa masala , a favorite of mine, the chickpeas were a little underdone, but at least that means they weren't from a can. a dish i had not tried before, the  bombay aloo  was quite good, a lightly-spiced medley of nearly-mashed potatos and vegetables. the  mixed-vegetable curry  which i would normally have avoided because of the presence of cauliflower, appeared to be light on said vegetable, so i tried it. it was pleasantly sweet compared to some meat curries, and was a good dish with which to mix the remainder of my rice.  the meal was well wrapped up with some quite dense but well-marinated  gulab jamun , which i was glad to see finally available after so many restaurants with kheer or nothing for dessert.   
   Absolute Rating   this place gets an extra point over what i would have normally given them for some extra perks unique to this buffet and the sheer surprise of not being as disappointed with it as i had been in the past.  7/10

   Ambience & Presentation   no music, no decoration, very low-budget appearance. however, the fact that the clientele is overwhelmingly indian and south asian makes me think that this place does not need "ambience" to bring in the customers they expect.  
   i only learned of this place after shopping at the waltham indian groceries and seeing the takeout menu on the counter. having tried all the other waltham indian buffets, i was very curious about one i hadn't heard of before. i had actually tried to go there the previous day, but their buffet wasn't ready at 11:30 due to a catering job, and i had other business in boston so i opted to head in and eat elsewhere. but i returned the next day.  my first impression was that this was very much a "hole-in-the-wall" place -- there are maybe 24 seats at 7 tables and the dining room is about the size of my bedroom at home, if not smaller. the tables looked like they had been salvaged from a diner that had gone out of business, and there were no decorations at all -- only blank white walls with the occasional sign. a very rudimentary electric buffet table was set up at the far end, with a motley collection of plates and silverware on top, along with some plastic cups. at noon, the 10 spaces in the buffet table were not all filled, and those that were were covered with soft plastic lids that hardly sealed the food's heat in and kind of sagged in the middle. i was the first to arrive, half an hour after the buffet had started.  a lesser reviewer might have gone and come back -- or just gone.  but i have had some of the best food at divey places, where little to no money goes into the presentation and all the money goes into the food. indeed, the patrons who arrived after me did not seem fazed by it at all.  this is another restaurant which cannot exactly be judged by the standards of other restaurants, since the cuisine is so different. the region of india represented here is Hyderabad, which is evidently on a border with south asia -- with the expected difference in cuisine. the most striking difference is the use of all- halal  meats (roughly, this is the muslim equivalent of kosher, and dictates the respect given to the animal before and while killing it). for those for whom this is a selling point, this is great. for me, i didn't notice much of a difference in quality, but i appreciate the ethics involved.  now, on to the food (since that's why you're here, right?). the cuisine, as i've said, is different and the expected dishes were not necessarily present. while i would normally start with a samosa, there were none. as a matter of fact, when i started, there wasn't even naan. so i started with what there was. the dishes were not labeled, but both meat dishes were chicken, one in a darker (curry) sauce, the other in a lighter (masala) sauce. there were two rices, one with chunks of meat which for convenience's sake i will call biryani, and one with orange and red grains with a smoky flavor. there was a dish which i avoided that looked like eggplant, and a couple of empty spaces which were filled later.  all of the dishes were uniquely spiced compared to my experience in other restaurants. nothing was really  spicy  but the spices used were clearly fresh and well mixed. the most troublesome thing which i immediately noticed was that all the meat still had bones in it. i am not sure whether "true" indian food is actually boneless or if that's an affectation influenced by the western desire for convenience. still, it was a bit inconvenient but i will not hold it against them. the rices were equally unique in spicing; the one with red and orange grains had a smoky flavor that made me wonder whether it's possible to cook rice in the tandoor, and the other was apparently the indian equivalent of dirty rice -- dark spices and chicken giblets -- i'm pretty sure i got a neck. the spicing was excellent and i eventually went for seconds (but avoided the giblets this time). midway through my first plate, the young waiter brought a pitcher of water to each occupied table, and brought out the naan and another dish. i went and got naan, which i recognized as storebought from one of the indian groceries in town. knowing that this place advertises their naan and paratha, i asked the waiter about this, and he said they don't cook naan for buffet, since it's extra work. this was a shame because the storebought naan really isn't all that good compared with fresh stuff. the other dish appeared to be some kind of dumplings in yogurt sauce, strongly reminiscent of falafel, but a little less dense and, of course, differently spiced. after a little research, i believe that dish was called "dahi wada" and is a hyderabadi appetizer (except that it was the last thing i ate, in this case). dessert was brought out later in the form of kheer, which i have established that i avoid.   
   Absolute Rating   worth going to for some different takes on familiar dishes and some new dishes as well. they are a bit understaffed and slow to fill the buffet, but this can be solved by not showing up too early -- try 12:30 and you may get a fully-stocked buffet. also, their dinner menu is incredibly inexpensive -- nothing is over $10 and vegetarian entrees are at most $7 -- and everything comes with free bread. i don't  review  dinners, but i'll definitely be there some night to try it out. better than average.  6/10

   Ambience & Presentation   Traditional music, well-lit and cozy (but not cramped) seating, plenty of tapestries. the buffet was well labeled and elegantly presented in round chafing pans with built-in lid holders. i did manage to make quite a mess with one overfilled pan, but i was more careful when i went for seconds. my apologies to the waiter who had to clean it up.  
   i had been here some time before, and the one thing i remembered was a dish placed over in the corner, almost as if they were discouraging people from trying it, simply labeled &quot;Bony Fish Curry&quot;. Curiosity overcame me -- and for succumbing to it, i suffered. the sauce was excellent and the fish succulent, but it was riddled with tiny pin-like bones that poked me at every bite. more time was spent picking bones out of my mouth than actually enjoying the flavor.  therefore, i was pleasantly surprised with today's experience.  it's important to note that this restaurant cannot be directly compared to others since it showcases cooking from a region not often seen in this area -- Bengal. certainly there are some differences in the cuisine; however, i can only review from my own point of view, which is necessarily biased from eating plenty of non-Bengali cuisine.  starting again with the  samosas : there appear to be a range of sizes of samosa -- small, medium and large, with the occasional extra-large. the samosas at this restaurant are  extra-small  -- smaller than i've seen anywhere else. for this reason, i believe there is a higher ratio of wrapping to filling, and thus a lower flavor quotient. what i'm trying to say, in layman's terms, is that the samosas were good, but i think they were too small for the filling's flavor to overcome that of the wrapper. still, i had 3. the  naan  was plain and a little more dense than i am used to, but serviceable for the purpose of soaking up leftover sauces. the  rice  was as per usual, with a little more clove and cardamom than cumin. the  salad  was a pleasant surprise, being mostly fresh tomatos, cucumbers and cilantro, with little in the way of greens. just the way i like it! in the  dal  i noticed some floating chilis and cilantro, but other than a subtle after-kick, there wasn't alot of what i would consider typical indian flavor. as a matter of fact, if i ignored the bright yellow color, i would have thought it was traditional new england lentil soup.  being a picky sort of person, i avoided the aloo gobi (don't like cauliflower) and the cabbage curry and headed straight to the meats. (didn't i tell you these reviews were subjective? by and large i have no problem with indian vegetarian entrees, but there are still some ingredients i can't bring myself to eat. YMMV.) the label said it was chicken but i'm fairly sure what i had was  lamb tikka masala , which was tender and well-spiced. but the real crowning glory was the fish -- without which no Bengali meal would be complete, evidently. this restaurant imports exotic fish from Bengal which makes their dishes as authentic as possible. the  fish curry  was a deep red, making me think more of masala, but it turns out the red was from the fish being done tikka-style in the tandoor. it was delicious, and glory be! there were no bones. also to the side of the dish was a pan of some unidentified fried objects which also turned out to be fish, curried and fried. for a moment i thought there were bones, but i was mistaken. without question, this restaurant is the seafood-lover's indian restaurant, and i recommend it especially to anyone who likes both cuisines and wants to try them masterfully combined.  again, i was dismayed to see there was no dessert on the buffet, but this is not unusual.   
   Absolute Rating   all in all, a good experience, and the fish dishes made up for anything else that was below-average -- which wasn't much. 7/10

    Gandhi    
   Region   Central Square, Cambridge  
   Address   704 Mass Ave.  
   Phone   617-491-1104  
   Price   $5.95 every day  
   Buffet Hours   noon-3:00  
   Payment options   cash, check, credit card ($10 minimum -- i found out the hard way, but there are Citizen's and Fleet bank ATMs directly across the street.)  
   Ambience   traditional music, regular restaurant tables and a few tapestries.  
   so, like any good indian food connoisseur (a label which i only hesitantly give to myself), i start a meal with samosa and end it with gulab jamun. unfortunately, gulab jamun is not often provided on buffets, and Gandhi was no exception here. but let's start at the beginning.    Samosa:  medium-sized, well spiced (and  spicy ), and i found a couple of whole chickpeas inside -- great! next comes the  Naan , which I always try plain before dipping it in anything. despite being halfway through a large mound of naan in the buffet tray, the piece i got had a very fresh texture, and was clearly baked in a tandoor (yes, i have seen griddle-fried naan before; with any luck i shall not have to review any on this site). the flavor was fine -- plain naan with no frills. likewise for the  Basmati Rice , which was artfully cooked with cumin seeds as per usual. i skip the  Salad  because i'm not really a greens sort of person, though in the capacity of a reviewer i should say it looked perfectly fresh and palatable to those who like that sort of thing with their indian food.   i have only recently gotten into eating  Saag  but found Gandhi's saag paneer lacking a bit in spicing. i suppose, as one who doesn't normally like spinach, my judgement of saag is unfair, but i think that the spicing of the dish should mask the fact that you're eating spinach at all. i have come upon a few restaurants that do this very well. the spicing is also integralsimply forming a tasty red shell around otherwise normal chicken. The same was true of the  Chicken Tikka Masala , which we all know is the dish of choice these days. the chicken was the perfect texture to soak in the flavor of the masala, which was quite well spiced. i headed for seconds on this dish, along with some naan and rice.  the buffet was sadly lacking in desserts. fortunately i was pretty full, although i can usually squeeze in a gulab jamun or two before leaving when given the option.   
   Absolute Rating   great chicken and samosas, not so great saag paneer, no desserts. still a good overall experience.  7/10

       ...and although i've been doing websites since the web was born, this is my first blog. it's a bit of an experiment, to see how this format works for me.
  
so i've lived in and around boston for more of my adult life than i care to think about, being a native vermonter and much more of a country boy than a city boy. but if there's one thing i love, it's good food. especially good ethnic food. and especially especially good indian food.
  
but i'm also on a budget. i can't afford to go out to eat at curry houses (so the brits call them) every night. but hallelujah! the indian buffet. almost every indian restaurant has one -- although they're not great for generating tips for waiters, they're good to bring in business. they also vary widely in quality and quantity. there are four in my current hometown of waltham, and many, many more in boston proper.
  
however, one thing sorely lacking on the net is good, complete review pages of these buffets. sure, you can go to zagat or boston.com and get a vague idea of what might be offered. but the truth of the matter is, indian buffets are a very different animal from indian dinners. some would say they're inferior -- you don't get as much choice, or you don't get to tell them how spicy to make it, or it's not necessarily as fresh because it's made  en masse . but i see it differently -- you get to try lots of different styles and dishes you might not have gotten around to trying if you were paying $10.95 per dish. if you like it, then perhaps you can go back for dinner and have it done fresh and to your own specifications for heat or meat (or veg).
  
so this blog will serve as my very subjective review page in my quest to try every indian buffet in the boston area at least once. it's subjective because as much as i love indian food, there are some things i cannot review -- i am not fond of eggplant, mushroom, kheer or any sort of lassi. so if your indian buffet experience hinges on how good the mango lassi or baingan bhartha is, you're going to have to look elsewhere. however, if you're willing to take my general quality judgements at face value, perhaps you will gain something after all.
  
please feel free to contact me if you are aware of an indian restaurant i have overlooked -- i know of some that do not routinely show up in review sites, and i am sure there are others. i would like to know of them, in the interest of completeness.
  
eat well, and be well.

    Ambience & Presentation   the front wall of this place is all glass, so it's very bright. if one didn't know the history of the space, one would be forgiven for thinking it's just another nouveau indian place, but before it was desi dhaba, it was a hip little cafe -- hence the hip decor. i have pleasant memories of the cafe, and i admit some resentment at the new place -- tho it's not their fault that the cafe is gone.  
    so i've passed this place several times, and actually didn't notice it was an indian restaurant until i checked the menu one day. as i mentioned, it used to be a cafe, and the sign out front is done in such a modernistic way i was not expecting it to be indian. serves me right for expecting a nod to tradition in the decor of all indian restaurants.  upon arriving, i got a seat in the corner next to one of the big windows. business was picking up, and folks began to file in as i ate. the restaurant was well attended by folks of indian descent as well as the usual MIT summer crowd, and the buffet was set up across the long counter that used to house coffeepots and pastries a few years ago. i got ready for another interpretation of &amp;amp;amp;amp;quot;gourmet" indian cuisine and dug in.  the  naan  had a slight taste of sourdough -- i will assume it was on purpose. the rice was as per usual, but there were no samosas. instead, there was  aloo pakora . this was a new one on me -- not an unusual concept by any means, but i had not had deep-fried potatos in an indian restaurant before. sadly, there was little or no indian spicing to them at all -- they were fairly bland potatos in a lightly-spiced batter. to their credit, however, i will say that they were some of the best french fries i've ever eaten. the  tandoori chicken  was crispy and lightly tangy on the outside, and tender inside, even for the white meat. the  chicken tikka masala  was similarly spiced tho tangier from the sauce, but i thought the pieces were a little small.  the vegetarian dishes were the most unique at this buffet. the  channa masala  may well have had another name -- the spicing was significantly different from other dishes i've eaten under the same name. there was more of a focus on the darker spices, but there was a pleasant afterburn. definitely one of the more interesting interpretations of this dish. the  dal  was tangy and quite spicy. if it weren't so watery, i would have given it a "best" rating just for the unique flavor. i skipped over the  mushroom saag  and headed for the dessert --  ras malai , to my surprise. i think the first time i tried this spoiled it for me -- the undertone of coconut was absent from these, but it was still a relief not to have to skip dessert.   
    Absolute Rating   ok, they have to do something about their "fries" -- i've had better spiced potatos at a diner in maine! but other than that, quite a good experience with some different interpretations.  7/10

   Ambience & Presentation   the decor of this restaurant is an interesting fusion of modern and traditional -- the "paintings" on the walls are backlit; the booths are luxurious, and the lamps used to light the place have to be seen to be believed. the music is traditional to pop, and there is a semi-open kitchen with tandoors behind glass. the chafing pans on the buffet are not covered, which seems to risk temperature irregularities in the food, but i did not notice a problem, being one of the first at the buffet.  
   this place was recommended to me by my housemates, who went there on a date for dinner. they waxed ecstatic about it, so since it was a special day for me (a day off from work, anyway), i headed out that way by T. it was a miserably wet day, and i've run out of waterproofing agent for my trenchcoat and i'd forgotten my umbrella, so even though i only endured a few blocks of walking, i was still fairly soaked by the time i arrived. actually, the directions given to me were vague enough that i only found it on the second pass. in any case, i got there as the buffet was opening, and they showed me to a booth and brought me a tiny glass of some kind of yellowish liquid. i asked what it was, and they told me it was fruit juice. upon tasting it, i was unable to identify the fruit, but it was heavily tinged with rosewater and mint. it was very rich, and i was unable to finish the entire glass. also unusual for a buffet was that they made fresh naan for every table, and asked each whether they wanted garlic, onion or plain naan.  the  garlic naan  i got was not particularly garlicky, but it was quite loaded with cilantro. the  samosas  were fresh and a little spicy, with a hint of asafoetida. there were two types of rice -- one with the standard cumin flavoring, and one labeled &quot;lemon rice&quot;. the  lemon rice  was delicious on its own, and it seemed wrong to use it merely to soak up sauces from other dishes, so on my second plate i got the regular rice instead. the  tandoori chicken  was perfect -- the red crust on the outside was crisp and spicy, and the inside meat was tender and easy to get off the bone. likewise for the  chicken tikka masala  and  chicken curry , both of which were cooked and spiced to perfection. sadly, there were two vegetarian dishes i avoided (picky me, i know) --  cabbage bhaji  and  shahi bhindi . the other two were probably the best  aloo saag  it has ever been my privilege to eat, with potatos cooked to just the right softness so that they absorbed the flavor of the saag and became part of the dish rather than afterthoughts, and  kadhi paneer , a paneer dish similar to the do piaza i reviewed on saturday, but without the tomato base. it was quite excellent, and after its sweet introduction there came an unexpected afterburn. the vegetables on the salad section were crisp and fresh as well, and i noticed kheer in among the sauces, and thus i skipped dessert. regretfully, i stepped outside again, where it had just begun to rain a bit harder ...   
   Absolute Rating   this place has made it into my exclusive list of the best in the boston area. so far nobody's reached above 9/10, but i am satisfied to find a place even this good.  9/10

   Ambience & Presentation   this is one of those open-front cafes you see alot in trendy areas of new york city and boston, except the area it's in isn't all that trendy -- it's off on a side street from harvard square. the natural light and air almost made me forget how crowded this place was -- not just with people, but with tables as well. the music, as is par for trendy places and trendy-wannabe places, was more IDM and techno than traditional indian music. i happen to like IDM and techno, but others may be turned off by it.  
   on my way back from reviewing india castle, i ran into a friend of mine who works at the L.A. Burdick chocolatier in the same building as this restaurant. he cautioned me against going here, but i told him that eventually i would have to. and so i did. my first impression was a good one -- the atmosphere is pleasantly dark and the copper chafing pans reminded me of another buffet i used to frequent which is always excellent. the tandoors were in a glass extension off the kitchen so you could watch breads and kebabs being cooked, and as i was eating, more and more items arrived on the buffet. sadly, i was full by the time they started making fresh masala dosai. i was one of the first to arrive for lunch, and i must not have been looking too indecent since they put me in the "window" (i.e. next to the sidewalk). i picked up some food on the buffet and shortly thereafter they brought me a basket of fresh bread, and i was all set for a good experience.  well, on the takeout menu i took with me, and on the website mentioned above, this place's cuisine is described as &quot;superb&quot; or &quot;fine&quot;. nowhere is it described as &quot;authentic&quot;. this is probably a good thing, since the cafe of india's buffet, which i generally consider to be representative of the quality, if not the usual spiciness, of the food served for regular meals, is about the least authentic indian meal i have ever eaten. one of the constants for several dishes was a conspicuous greasiness not present at other buffets. the  samosa  was a little greasy on the outside (i know they're deep-fried, but somehow other places make them appear less greasy) and not so fresh on the inside. i found it a little bland. the  rice  was what i have dubbed &quot;tandoori-style&quot;, with little red or orange grains which tend to be a little harder than usual, hence the suggestion that it was partially done in the tandoor. i don't know if this is true, or how they really color the rice, but until someone tells me otherwise i'll just call it by that name. another unusual dish was a  yellow bell pepper soup . it wasn't bad, but tasted (and looked) mostly like finely ground yellow peppers, water, a hint of cilantro and salt. not much else, and more at home at a trendy nouveau-cuisine place than an indian restaurant.  on to the entrees. the  tandoori chicken  was smaller than usual, cooked just to the point where any less would have been unsafe, and not terribly well spiced. the crispy red coating i see at other places was just a mild red tinge on most pieces. the  saag paneer  had a flavor reminiscent of something else i've eaten in the past -- i don't remember what it was but i'm sure it wasn't indian. i tried a few more bites to bring back the taste memory, but to no avail. the  chicken tikka masala  was probably the best thing there, and even that was pretty standard in flavor. it reminded me of the first time i had the dish, but i have had much better since. the  goat curry  was probably pretty standard for goat -- it had large chunks of bone and also large chunks of fat. it seemed it would have been less trouble to do away with the bone so i could only have complained about it being too fatty, but now i have to complain about it being too bony  and  too fatty. both the chicken and the goat dishes had very greasy sauces that beaded up on the plate a bit -- this is understandable for the goat, due to the fat content, but i don't understand why for the chicken. there was also a  mixed vegetable curry  which i avoided on account of the broccoli. oh, i forgot, there was an  aloo choley  (potatos and chickpeas) which was also less than memorable. hence, probably, why i forgot it until now.  for dessert, aside from the usual kheer, there was  halwa ! this was a nice treat to end what was otherwise a less-than-satisfactory dining experience. it wasn't as good as i'd had it before, and the texture really is alot like cream-of-wheat that's been sitting in the fridge for a couple of days, but it was pleasant enough to dull the mild sensation i was having of wasting my time there. at least, it was, until i got the bill.   
   Absolute Rating   if you like your indian food seriously dumbed down for the new england palate, or you just don't usually like indian food, try this. it might be a good gateway to the real stuff.  5/10

   Ambience & Presentation   this place has two rooms, and the one the buffet takes place in is much brighter and more standard-restaurantish than the dinner room, albeit with the usual tapestries and decorations. usually they have traditional indian music playing, but the last time i went it was a radio program which, halfway through my meal, switched to traditional irish music. the staff didn't seem to notice. by the way, the staff here are very helpful and accomodating, and will not hesitate to tell you what things are and exactly how you should eat them. although they know me here and i have never been one for kheer, they will always push it on me when i am done. my water glass is never empty, and i never feel ignored. and no, i haven't told them that i'm reviewing the place ;> ... some people may feel uncomfortable with the level of service, but i prefer more to less.  
   i feel i should preface this review by saying that i had given up on this place earlier in the year when i noticed the slow encroachment of chinese-style entrees on their buffet. i understand that they hail from the northeastern part of india which has a border with china, but it still felt odd to be eating one thing on my plate with soy sauce and the next with masala. also, on several occasions the water tasted of soap. one occasion would be forgivable, but it happened on  several  occasions. however, this was before i started reviewing buffets, and in the course of my reviews i knew i would have to go back and put up with the soapy water again, and probably have to dock them points for it.  you can probably see where this is going.  as it happened, today's experience at the Bombay Mahal was quite refreshing and did a bit to rekindle my faith in the place. their buffet is one of the larger in the area, with rice, naan, an appetizer and about 7 entrees. the quality is consistently good and the food fresh. now, on with the review. i will overlook the fact that the rice did not show up on the buffet until my second plate; i came just as it opened and i understand that as the enthusiastic staff set about making me comfortable, something was bound to be forgotten. when i got up to fill the second plate and the rice was not yet there, i asked a nearby waiter who nearly had a heart attack when he realized it hadn't been put up yet. in any case, the  rice , when i got it, was delicately spiced with cumin (i seem to say that alot; it's true of most indian rice). the other sauce-delivery medium, the  naan  was plain and a bit thin, but with a fold was a fine utilitarian method of soaking up leftover sauce, especially on my rice-less first plate. the  samosa , which i have experienced being a bit over-salty here before, was quite well spiced this time with an extra-crispy outside and a moist inside that seemed to be lower on the potatoes than usual.  the entrees were particularly good this time around, even though there seemed to be a pervasive sweetness to several dishes. the one entree i avoided (picky me) was the shahi bhindi, as i don't like okra. the  tandoori chicken  was a little over-salty, but well spiced and well-cooked. the  chicken tikka masala  made me understand the way this dish is supposed to act -- one distinct flavor for the sauce, and another for the chicken. the sauce was sweeter than usual, and the chicken saltier than usual, and the two flavors complemented each other but did not actually combine to make one flavor -- i could actually taste the difference between the two elements of the dish. excellent! the  lamb curry  was quite tender and gingery, and not too sweet, which counterbalanced the sweetness of the chicken's sauce a bit.  my second plate (the one with rice on it) was all vegetarian entrees. the waiters made a big deal of the  kadhi pakora  and explained to me in detail what it was and how healthy it was. i've already had it, but it seems worth a mention that it's not on their menu but it's a chick-pea flour dumpling in a yogurt mustard sauce, similar to the hyderabadi dumpling i tried a few weeks back. the  aloo saag  was quite good, and would especially appeal to those who like to know they are eating spinach. i don't, but this was just on the line for me -- spiced enough that i concede its tastiness but still reminiscent of spinach. the potatoes in it were a little underdone, so they hadn't fully absorbed the flavor of the saag. the highlight of the meal for me was the  paneer do piaza . anyone who's eaten an indian dinner with me will know that my favorite vegetarian entree (and perhaps my favorite entree, period) is paneer do piaza, and it's very rare that it appears on a buffet. i was a little chagrined to find that it was very sweet, and a little heavier on the tomatos and lighter on the curry than i'd prefer, but beggars can't be choosers and i finished my meal with it gladly.   
   Absolute Rating   definitely on par with the better buffets in boston, and a very close second best in waltham.  8/10

   Ambience & Presentation   one of the first things i noticed when i arrived here was the lack of an indian smell about the place. most places have that warm, inviting scent of dark spices and tandoori meats that gets your mouth watering before you even walk in the door. this place has the buffet in a separate room and the kitchen so far back that no scent of indian food touches your nostrils until you're ready to eat. also, the mood is further set by an extremely bright dining area with no noticeable windows, a lack of music and a lack of a single indian customer.  
   this restaurant is one of the big stumpers of my current hometown. i have been here to eat dinner and been incredibly impressed. their menu is incredibly varied, and their food is always very, very well done. the rating they have as possibly one of the best indian restaurants in the boston area is well deserved -- as long as you only have dinner.  the buffet is a different story. i don't understand the point of having a buffet at your restaurant unless it represents your dinners and gets people to come back. i have given this place a couple of previous chances, in the hopes that i had simply hit it on a couple of bad days, but i took an extra long lunch break from work this friday so i could review the place on a day when the buffet is actually running, and so i had to take what i got. by now you can probably tell that this is going to be another bad review. i don't like to do them, but the people must know(tm).  there were no samosas, and the only other item that passed for a deep-fried appetizer was the  broccoli pakora . i skipped this since i don't do broccoli, and dug in elsewhere. the  rice  was nice to look at but kind of bland. the  paratha  was well done but a little greasy. i don't understand why places serve non-absorbent bread with buffets, but to new mother's credit, they do like to mix it up a bit with the breads on their buffet -- not always the same plain naan. last time it was broccoli naan, which i ate only because it was better than wasting the sauces.  this place's buffet has a full salad bar with fruit and veggies which could be a little fresher. the addition of chinese crispy noodles is a little disturbing in this environment; though i do enjoy them i just couldn't bring myself to put them on the same plate with indian food. to their credit, they do serve two different soups each day, one coconut soup and one  dal , which was a little watery for my taste but had a nice tang to it.  a new saag dish for me was  beef saag  (i know it's standard, i've just never seen it on a buffet before). it was actually quite well textured and spiced, and the beef was tender. the same goes for their  tandoori chicken , which was tender and tangy and just about right. the  chicken tikka masala  was probably one of the most disturbing flavorings i've ever had. the smoky flavor tasted almost as if it had been added afterward, and the taste reminded me very much of these really good beef hotdogs i used to have as a kid. while the taste memory was pleasant, the reality returned to me with the fact that this was chicken tikka masala and it's  not  supposed to taste like &quot;wild winds beef hots&quot;. there was an uneventful  dal makhni , and a  punjabi curry  which was pakoras in a tangy yellow mustard-based yogurt sauce. there was no dessert, not even kheer. frankly, i could have had better food from one of the microwave packets i get at waltham india grocery.   
   Absolute Rating   this place would have gotten a better rating if i didn't know they were capable of so much better food. stay away for lunch, save your judgement of this place and eat dinner here instead.  5/10

   Ambience & Presentation   this place, off the beaten path near central square, actually looks like it was once a small diner. however, little has been done to convince anyone that it is now an indian restaurant, except to a certain extent the type of food served. i was the only person in the restaurant at noon today, except for two indian kids who came in, apparently to eat, talked to the waiter and promptly left -- why, i don't know. the wallpaper is all traditional new england scenes with deer, moose and ducks, and the music playing was definitely modern to bhangra. an incongruous mood was set even before i dug in, so let's see where this goes ...  
   to be honest, this was the place that gave me the idea to start reviewing indian buffets. the last time i was here it was more or less the same as today's experience, but the gulab jamun was better. with that, i'll go ahead.   the buffet here is quite large. they say &quot;16-course&quot; but to be fair i don't think they should include the chutney and tamarind as courses. still, 10 courses plus salad, sauces and desserts is considerably larger than your average buffet, and they do this every day, not just sundays.   the  rice  was yellowish, perhaps from saffron, with cumin seeds. i won't say &quot;delicately flavored with cumin&quot; here because there wasn't much flavor at all. a very utilitarian rice, good for soaking up sauces and not much else. the  samosa  was a little underdone on the outside (one portion of the one i had was actually doughy as if it had not been fully cooked) and a little over-salty inside. the  pakora  was better done, less salty and better flavored than the samosa. the  naan  was truly excellent, probably the second-best i've had up to this point, and that's saying something.  my initial reaction to the  tandoori chicken  was that it was pleasantly crispy on the outside, but then i realized it was merely burnt. unfortunately it wasn't too flavorful on the inside either.  one thing this place does well is potatos. every dish that used them had them cooked to perfection, where they'd soaked up the surrounding flavors and were just solid enough to avoid falling apart when you picked them up. also, they must have had a surplus on them since they were in at least three dishes. the first was  aloo saag  which was a little bland but well textured, and texture is half the battle with saag, at least for me. the second was  channa aloo , which had good spicing but not enough of it. there was a good afterburn which would have been more pleasant had the dish been spiced better to begin with. the third potato dish was  beef curry  which, with the potatos and the spicing used, more resembled traditional new england beef stew with a hint of clove and cinnamon. the  chicken tikka masala  was quite well done, with a hint of coconut. the dish i had been looking forward to was their unique  gulab jamun , which are smaller than usual and in the dim light near the buffet, are nearly black in color. the time i had come here in the past, the honey-rosewater they're usually floating in had been liberally dosed with coconut. this time, there was no such extra flavor, and they were a little disappointing. their outer crust is a little thicker here, possibly from being deep-fried long enough to turn them nearly black, but this means that if you take a dry gulab jamun (with no syrup in the bowl) and cut into it, the syrup held inside spills out and fills the bowl. this texture made them almost worth it, but i really missed the coconut from last time.   
   Absolute Rating   some redeeming features, but all in all not a great buffet. fortunately it's not too expensive.  6/10

   Ambience & Presentation   another trendy, nouveau-decor place near the heart of all things trendy in boston -- no surprise. music is lite jazz to new-age, and the waiters were moderately attentive -- to a fault; one attempted to take my bread basket away after only one plate. you'd think they'd never seen anyone go for seconds!  
   today i figured i'd experiment a bit. the previous weekend, after eating at desi dhaba in central square, i walked to newbury street and back, and passed this place on the way. the decor turned me off; i generally avoid places that are overly  nouveau  since their cuisine is rarely as authentic as the smaller &quot;hole-in-the-wall&quot; type places. i have been proven wrong on this a couple of times, but i've also been right far more often. but that's not where i decided to experiment.  my experiment was to see how long it'd take me to ride my bike into boston from my house in waltham, ending at the ramp up to mass. ave around newbury st and culminating in a meal at a conveniently-located indian restaurant. i was not aware of the starting point of the bike path, so i ended up on storrow drive somehow, and after a few harrowing minutes i was able to pull into an emergency stopping area and wait for a gap in the traffic so i could cross to the actual bike path. i'm lucky one of the angry motorists wasn't a cop, or this outing could have been more expensive than it was. all in all, it took me about an hour to bike in and i arrived with an especially hearty appetite.  this place's buffet is not large, and doesn't look like anything special, until you start eating. the  naan  is delivered fresh to the table, but you might be better off taking it out of the basket if you don't want a waiter to take it while you're up getting more food. there were no samosas, but the  pakora  was serviceable -- i think the curry flavor was a little generic, like commercial curry powder, but reasonably good. there was a soup called &quot;bhindi curry soup&quot; which was definitely  dal . it had a nice lentil-y texture without being too thick or watery, and the main spices were black pepper and cilantro, both of which were fresh enough to be recognized on their own.  having dispensed with the appetizers, i plunged on into the entrees, which are where this place really stands out. to my delight, i was not kept away from any of the dishes by the restaurant's namesake, which i assumed would be included in at least one dish since the menu describes it as the &quot;king of vegetables&quot;. the  tandoori chicken  was especially good here, and the tangy, smoky flavor which is the dish's signature somehow managed to remain intact past the crispy outer crust and into the tender meat inside. definitely one of the best i've had of this dish. the  channa saag  had an unexpected sweet flavor that was not unpleasant, though i have not tasted another saag dish like it. the last dish was one of the most amazing chicken dishes i've had. i came to it expecting merely what it looked like -- chicken tikka masala. but this was  chicken chettinad , a south-indian dish with a burn to match, but only afterwards. it was like a sweeter version of tikka masala, but with very clear influence from coconut, cloves and cilantro. bravo!  after a little wandering about in the nauseatingly hip and crowded newbury district, i left by the bike path and this time i stayed off the major thoroughfares until watertown.
