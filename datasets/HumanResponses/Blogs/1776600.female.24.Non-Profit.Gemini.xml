       so i move to california a month ago. i am incredibly lucky to score a job just one week after arrival. not just any job, a job at GOOGLE, the search engine we all know and love. i'm a little hesitant to jump right into full-time work (i had just quit my job in austin a mere ten days prior) but my savings is pathetic, so i accept. in my initial phone interview, the woman says i may be overqualified for the job but i don't care. it's a job, it's a good company, and there are free lunches. so i settle in, get trained, begin working (reviewing adwords ads, you know - those little text ads that come up on the right hand side of google after you do a search). i score a cubicle next to the window and am pretty content to sit there all day listening to CDs and looking at porn sites. (it's a dirty job.) i go really fast. i sort of view it as a game - how fast can i go, how accurate can i be? it's basically proofreading, and checking ads against google's many, many policies which i cannot disclose lest i be sued for breaking the sacred NDA. treating your job as a game is not a good idea. looking back i'm thinking perhaps i was sabotaging myself. i hate advertising. too bad that's what my degree is in. i hate working 9 to 5. what a waste of a day! i left texas to escape from that. so anyway, i go to lunch with my fellow ants and we gossip about the people who've been fired, speculate as to why, and quietly pray that we will not be next. i never thought it would happen to me. that's why, last week when my manager who looks and speaks like he has a stick up his ass says to me "do you have a minute," leads me to a secluded conference room where an HR chick lowers the guillotine.   i turn into a complete basketcase. i start crying and blabbering. ohmygod what am i going to do i just moved here from texas how am i going to pay rent can't i have another chance why oh why woe is me. so i'm sad, offended, pissed off, scared. i go home to my friends' apartment where there are no less than 10 people (out of town visitors, roommates, friends) and cannot find a place of solitude. so i choose the room with the least amount of people and go in and sob. my mom calls. no way i'm answering that. thank you god for caller ID. but you know what? i got over it the next day. i started looking for other forms of income if you know what i mean. (kidding!) really, i am a yoga instructor, so i began to seek out yoga instructing positions. let's be honest, i'll probably have to work in advertising, or do some clerical bullshit or wait tables to make ends meet. but full time yoga will come sooner than later...

          urlLink This is me embracing technology.     With elementary HTML skills, a template and a lot of trial and error, I redesigned my yoga website. I like internet technology. Unlike 90% of people I know, I did not obtain a degree in computer science. Actually I cheated mercilessly in high school computer science by cracking my geeky friend's password (it was her middle name, come on!) because C++ or whatever it was was completely beyond me.   Changing trains of thought: If you need to be successful to gain confidence and you need confidence to be successful, how the f--, er, heck, do you win? I have been struggling with this paradox lately as a young entrepreneur. I have poise and confidence, sometimes, when it comes to marketing and selling my services. Then someone is mean or I get rejected a bunch and all I want to do is burn my to-do lists, unplug the phone and nap the workday away. I realize they're not personally attacking me. Regardless, it's hard to be patient and keep making the calls and posting the ads and incurring the expenses with no results. I can deal with delayed gratification, but the longer the delay, the more I begin to find fault with myself. Like worrying that my intentions aren't right, blaming a lack of experience for failure, and worst yet, not giving myself credit for little successes which do happen now and then. Yesterday I really began to think maybe I should give this up and go back to corporate career world. But that was just a false threat to myself. Nooooooooooo! I will triumph! And now back to the grindstone.

       My new favorite word, bumping long-standing champ PLETHORA is  ECUMENICAL . That is, according to Merriam-Webster: 1 : worldwide or general in extent, influence, or application 2 a : of, relating to, or representing the whole of a body of churches b : promoting or tending toward worldwide Christian unity or cooperation. The house I live in is extremely ecumenical. A mormon, a Catholic, a Jew and a yoga teacher living in relative harmony under one roof. For me, this concept expands to include all religions great and small. Buddhism, Sufism, Hinduism, Paganism, and (yes, Mom) Catholicism, and on and on. Many paths to the same endpoint. Nirvana, self-realization, heaven, infinite bliss, enlightenment. Many names for the same thing which created us and sustains us: God, Jehovah, Jesus, Allah, Krishna, Shiva, the Universe, the Divine.  For Lent, I'm giving up the f-word.

       Yesterday I taught four yoga classes. Then I drank two pints. It's all about the balance. Unless it's true (and I can't remember where I heard/read this recently, "anyone who drinks has a drinking problem.") Oh, I know.  Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas  by Tom Robbins. So there goes that theory.  I have lost twelve pounds since moving to California. My next rendezvous back to Tejas is at the end of May for my little sis's high school gradumacation (does that mean she's grown up now?!) and my 24th birthday. The goal is to drop 18 more by then. So that will require stepping it up a notch, but I think I can...I think I can...I think I can.  Right now I'm reading  The Little Engine that Could.  Sike. Really, I just started  The Da Vinci Code  by Dan Brown. It is a page turner to be sure and has an interesting premise, but so far seems a little too Hollywood perfect, i.e. cliffhangers at the end of every chapter, and very convenient, spontaneous revelations a la Nancy Drew.

       Happy Random Acts of Kindness Day!  Little-known global holiday, "random acts of kindness day" takes place tomorrow all across the earth. So much better than Valentine's Day. Although, remember when Valentine's Day used to be fun back in elementary school? I had forgotten. You get candy and love and notes from all your friends. Now it's just this over-marketed way to make single adults feel bad. But I really feel that I'm over the whole V-day thing, at this stage. I really let it get to me in high school. On Saturday I may very well stay in, eat pizza (it's a sin!) and watch movies on tivo. I'd be cool with that.   Anyway, do your civic duty and perform a random act of kindness, tomorrow, and every day for that matter. Smile just to smile, laugh out loud, tell someone you love and appreciate them for no good reason.

        My So-Called Career   Well, hello again. My, it's been a while. So much has happened since my last post. It feels like ages since I worked at Google. I have somehow managed to make ends meet, financially and spiritually, though my (too?) many entrepreneurial ventures have not proven profitable --YET-- for the most part. I'm happy though, overall, really happy. I have a lot of free time, most of the time I get to be my own boss, more and more these days, aside from when I'm substitute teaching school or valeting, which hasn't happened in a while (the latter).   Which gets me to thinking, I should valet again. It's kind of a good social outlet. Hey, 97% males. That's a good ratio for me. Of course, out of them only a few do I find attractive, only one have I foolishly dated. Life is good, but my love life stinks! I'm a 23 year old vegetarian, neo-hippie, left-handed yoga instructor/business-owner/professional networker/closet writer/what else is it that I do? Well, whatever I've done in the past year has earned me 10 W-2 forms for the IRS. Web monkey, advertising copywriter, probably taught about 200 yoga classes, worked at Stanford Hospital, Stanford Bookstore, and some Stanford dining hall doing catering (the job that lasted a day before I decided food service is not for me), valeted many, many BMWs up crazy hills in San Francisco, wrecked that limo, worked for those horrible Halloween and Christmas stores at that horrible mall.   Subbing is good, in that sense. It prevents me from having to work unpleasant and/or painstakingly boring jobs that pay shittily, while still affording me ample time to work on my businesses. What are these enigmatic businesses, you wonder? (Or not.)  As I have made clear, I am a yoga instructor by trade. Yoga really is my top passion. I do it every day, teach several times a week. The more I do it, the more I love it. Meditation and yoga have become the central part of my life, at the moment, which makes for pretty nice days, though not without their challenges and troubles.  I'm also part owner of a web-based furniture store. My friend and I, and her husband and this man in Mexico who I've never met in person nor spoken to but have had an email-business-partnership for at least a year now, worked on this site for quite a while, found a vendor, chose products, wrote the catalog copy, built the website, marketed it. (Mostly on Google AdWords, how ironic.) The sucky part about being fired from google is there's no way you can boycott them out of spite. And even if you could, no one else would so it wouldn't matter.  ANYway, the site is www.lagavia.com. Ch-ch-check it out! Buy something. It really is cool stuff.   But wait, there's more. I'm teaching yoga. Oh yes. Not as much as I could though. Currently, I teach Tuesday mornings, every other Wednesday and Saturday, and a Vinyasa and a prenatal class on Sundays in San Mateo and Mountain View. I just taught my second free first yoga class to a company this week. There were 15 people and they loved it, so I *think* they going to start paid classes this coming week.  I'm looking to teach more corporate classes and private or semi-private lessons. I had a private student lined up but she has a back problem and is on hiatus. Another shameless plug for myself: my yoga website is www.yogafreedom.com.  Check it out if you live in the SF Bay Area and are into yoga. I currently reside in lovely suburbia (Palo Alto) but am planning a move to The City in August. I have been known to drive all the way to San Francisco just to teach a yoga class (and then go to Crissy Field or shopping in the Haight or drinking in the Mission).   We have 2 more jobs, kids. Is this ridiculous or what?   I got involved with a "network marketing" company a few months ago. This business opportunity was actually presented to me the very same day I was relieved from my duties at the Goog-enheim.   Rosie Spiegel called me up to see if I could sub a yoga class for her. She told me that as an entrepreneur and yoga instructor, it would definitely be worth my time to take a look at this company. I didn't really want to but thought, oh why not.   That was in August. In late October I signed on as an independent associate of Usana Health Sciences (www.usana.com). For the longest time, I thought -- what have I done? I'm not cut out for network marketing, I'm no saleswoman. I don't know that many people; I just moved here. On top of that, my parents were incredibly unsupportive, especially initially. But over time, and with the help of taking the products personally, feeling good and losing weight, and attending a Usana-sponsored conference in San Antonio recently, I have definitely become more inspired by this company and glad I made the decision to join.   Usana produces the only nutritional supplements manufactured to pharmeceutical GMP standards and listed in the Physician's Desk Reference. The products are scientifically-based and designed to work at the cellular level to help prevent degenerative diseases that have become epidemic -- heart disease, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and so on. There are so many great stories of people whose lives have been changed by the Usana products -- dramatic health improvements and now dramatic weight loss.  Usana is a 12-year old, publicly traded network marketing company that is experiencing tremendous growth and success because it capitalizes on the ever-expanding health and wellness industry, the aging baby boomer population, and using the internet to run a home-based business. Imagine a legitimate, fun way to earn unlimited residual income while helping yourself and others dramatically improve their physical and financial health.  If you're a self-starter who cares about good health and nutrition and is looking for better health and wealth, I'm certain you could and would excel at this sort of venture.  Whew! Okay, my final business venture is the one that has been the least successful so far, probably because I haven't put much energy into promoting it. I am an "Advisor" for Linda Christas, a non-profit educational company that offers tutoring services, college preparation counseling (everything from choosing a major to help on applications and essays), alternatives to traditional public school, via online homeschooling complete with certified teachers and licensed counselors. I think I'm scared to promote it because that will mean I'll have to do a presentation to parents and then they'll have questions and I won't know how to answer them. This is silly, I know. I have read lots of books about education and I continue to. I guess I need to bite the bullet and start presenting. Practice makes... better.  So that's my professional life at the moment. damn! no wonder i'm not dating. Time for bed.

       A week ago, my grandpa went to his final PCS (permanent change of station), as he called it. He died of complications related to cancer and Parkinson's disease. It has been a whirlwind week of driving, flying, hugging, emotions, visitations, ceremonies, crying, laughing. He had been sick for quite a while and on a gradual decline for a few years. He spent the last few months at a nursing home. I saw him in January and feel very blessed to have had the chance to say goodbye then. In fact, I wanted that to be my last goodbye but I was somewhat peer-pressured into viewing the body at the funeral home. I realize that this can help the healing process for some, but I have had a lifelong fear of the dead, death, and dying and absolutely did not want to see a lifeless Grampa lying in a casket. But I came around and I guess it wasn't so bad.   There was a lengthy Catholic mass/funeral at which I spoke. I did the whole gratitude thing. (If you're Catholic, you know what I'm talking about -- "blah blah blah... Lord, let us pray.") I felt my voice was shaking but no one else could tell. Must have been my inner fear of being struck down in the house of God for consciously opting out of Catholicism.   He was a Colonel in the Air Force and therefore had a 21-gun salute and fancy flag-folding ceremony which was pretty neat. My Uncle gave a heartfelt, funny and moving eulogy. At least a hundred people came. Brothers, cousins, nieces, old friends and war buddies.   Maybe it's all the meditation and spiritual stuff I do, but I definitely feel that I am getting over my fears of death. In this case, it is almost a relief to know that he's no longer suffering from an ailing body. After all, we are just energy (souls, if you will) encased in these bodies. Once the bodies are finished with their earthly pursuits, our energy travels to another realm. (Heaven, maybe, I hope?)

        confessions of a nervous hippie   In perusing the bookstore shelves lately, I've noticed a sudden spike in the new titles containing the phrase, "Confessions of..." (a dangerous mind, a teenage drama queen, an ugly stepsister, a grieving Christian, to name the most popular).   Why the sudden need for penance? Or the forewarning: you are about to read a confession? But really, every piece of writing can be viewed as the author's "confession," whether she is revealing a deep, dark secret or simply telling it like it is.  I confess! I miss Austin in the spring. At the same time, I love California and it's beautiful and warm and there are nice beaches and mountains and forests. But Austin has SXSW, Eeyore's birthday party and Bob Marley fest, three events quite distinctive to the city, which I have attended for years and will no longer. SXSW is going on next week, I think. For you laymen, it's South by Southwest, a massive convening of musicians, filmmakers and interactive/high tech people upon the city to eat, drink, and rock. (See also www.sxsw.com.) On the downside, it's crowded, expensive and a bitch to park.   Eeyore's, of quite a different vibe, is a one-day tribute to Winnie the Pooh's fictitious donkey friend in Pease Park, complete with drum circles, live music, vegetarian snacks (and greasy meat too), vendors, and every hippie within a 50-mile radius of Austin. If you don't smoke pot, beware where you breathe. And, within a week of Eeyore's is Bob Marley Fest, which is clearly a reggae music festival. It's held at Auditorium Shores, a big grassy field right next to Town Lake, with a killer view of the Austin skyline.   I'm sure there are a plethora of equally great spring and summer festivals here in the Bay Area. Now to find them!

        Zen and the Art of Substitute Teaching    Did I mention that I'm a sub? Yes, since January. No, I'm not planning to get my teaching credential. I'm just a yoga teacher trying to make ends meet.   God bless these K-12 teachers. Especially the middle school variety. Those kids are nothing but obnoxious. Were we this annoying at that age?  Today is my first day administering a test as a sub. I'm in an 8th grade social studies class in Mountain View. And it's still the same old tricks. Sitting in unassigned seats. Whispering during the test.  Miss, I don't have a pencil.  But I can't complain. I'm getting paid to sit here and supervise some relatively obedient middle schoolers, blog, and otherwise fool around online.   There is definitely a zen aspect to subbing, and it certainly helps to practice deep breathing and mindful meditation on some days whilst teaching, or attempting to teach, or attempting to maintain sanity in the face of thirty unhappy freshmen. I think it's because you really have no choice but to be present. Each day is distinctive, always a new classroom, lesson, teacher's pet and class clown. If you're like me and tend to run later than earlier, it sometimes means waking up to an automated call from the sub finder at 5:30 am, going back to sleep until 7:20 and either hitting traffic or getting lost on my way to east San Jose, thereby ending up at school just as the first bell rings.   If there's a lesson plan, I'm golden. Of course, it's nice when there's a video to be watched. Although it can become a bit grating to hear the same Spanish telenovela every period for SIX periods straight. Elementary school kids are cuter, obviously, and easier to scare, but you actually have to read to them and teach them stuff. High school kids are usually independent and pretty intelligent, but a lot of the guys are super immature still. Like paper airplane immature. I try to steer clear of middle schools, perhaps just because my very first day on the job was horrific, and it was in an 8th grade science class. I sent 3 kids to the office, had to come home and immediately sleep I was so exhausted.  And now to my other blog. I'm starting one that's devoted to articles and information about...guess what... Y O G A! Check it out, tell your yoga friends:   urlLink http://yogafreedom.blogspot.com

       In cruising around the Internet lately, I am reminded over and over of the vast array of information available to each of us at the click of a button. Just about anything you can dream you can find online. Tarot readings, khaki pants, diamond earrings, self-help books, better technology, more targeted marketing strategies, and yoga mats galore. It's overwhelming!  In my journeys across every yoga website ever, I encountered many great ideas, wonderful designs and helpful articles. Not the least of which was entitled  urlLink What if I have a crush on a yoga teacher?  Being a yoga teacher by trade, this topic is especially relevant. I made the "naive choice" of becoming involved with a yoga student during my first year of teaching. I can't call it a mistake, because it was a fine relationship from which I learned more about myself. Further, to this day I maintain a solid friendship with this guy, let's call him Tim.   I would urge other yoga teachers and women of similar professions (i.e. massage therapists, acupuncturists, and so on) to STEER CLEAR of dating students or clients at all costs. Or if you do choose to date one, make a swift end to the professional relationship by referring them to another teacher or healer. I found that with Tim, once he was no longer a student, I felt a lot less immoral about our relationship.   On a related note, Tim and I still talk weekly. He lives in Austin and is dating someone new. When I first found out, back in September I was none too happy. I realized that this was irrational, of course. I live in California, he lives in Texas and is planning to move to Europe. I should be happy that he's found someone new. He told me it wasn't serious anyway. Well, yesterday he was inexplicably compelled to tell me that he is feeling more strongly about this girl. I thought I was over it, but I immediately became quieter and couldn't really think of a smooth way to change the subject. I couldn't even mask my disappointment. And then I began to deny it, especially when he called me on it. Worse yet, I felt lame or inadequate or at the very least petty for having these jealous feelings many months after we broke up, during which time I moved halfway across the country and was living the dream! The truth is, I am happy for him and I wish him the best and care about our friendship, blah, blah, blah. I guess I am still wishing there was some way we could get together again, even though there is about a 0.05% chance of that happening. Why? Most likely because I haven't found anyone else to bump him out of position. So far in California, I have had some laughably baaaad dates. Some good ones too, but fewer and further between. Do I need a boyfriend to be happy? OF course not. Instead, I'm going to try and take this opportunity to cultivate happiness for Tim and his new girlfriend and consequently continue cultivating happiness in my own life.

       My head is reeling. Having been into spiritual stuff since early adolescence I switch between (irrational) feelings that I "should" be something other than I am, and deep, quiet knowledge that everything was, is, and always will be alright.   Most moments lately, I feel happy. Peaceful, centered, joyful even sometimes. More and more I realize the power of the human mind, in all its complexity, confusion, bewitching glory.   Dear ego, Id, and Superego. Beloved consciousness, subconsciousness, intuition, reflex, dreaming, waking. Blessed emotion, insight, sensation, perception. Saintly meditation, relaxation, attachment, aversion. My God, Divine Mother, the Universe, Allah, Buddha, Hare Krshna, Hare Krishna, whatever your name is! Jesus Christ?! What does it all mean? When do I get to heaven? Enlightened? Can't I just get a little taste of Zen, Satori, Nirvana, Samadhi, Ananda? Realize pure consciousness, reunite with my soul's purpose, my higher self, inner child, alterego?  Why are we such sinners? What's with all the suffering?   From where I'm sitting, on my bed, in my room, in my house, in Palo Alto, Calif., USA, Earth, the Universe, it's overwhelming. I. I am who I am but who am I? I do. I write. I love. I try.   As I figure out this crazy mixed up wonderful stuff, these tiny vivid moments connected together with such seamless grace, I want to share it with everyone I touch. Won't you share yours with me too?  Direct from my heart to yours, Michelle M Fajkus

       It's really a miracle that I ever post to this blog. Information overload really gets me when I'm online. Especially lately. I'm checking eighteen email accounts, updating websites, randomly Googling, socially networking (orkut, friendster, mixermixer, can't you all just join into one?), IM-ing with friends and occasional strangers requesting naked yoga lessons, reading the news, and on and on. I think, "Ooh, I want to blog." But then I get distracted by flashing lights and the sound of new mail.   At long last, here I am. Today, and of late, I am keenly aware of the need to balance work and play. Focus and relaxation. Mind spinning and mind stilling. I spend hours on end going, going, going, and if I don't meditate a while, or go for a walk or whatever, I begin to grow tired, or stressed, or caught up in the details of Tuesday, May 25, 2004, 12:34 pm. Then I look outside and see the dogs basking in the sun and remember to breathe, close up the laptop and give it a rest.  I volunteer taught yoga and meditation at Sunnyvale Middle School yesterday. Some kids were attentive, others rude or bored. After school, they erupted into yells, formed into circles of cliques and digital rings. I wonder: why do twelve year olds have cell phones? Are we breeding a new wave of stress monkeys? Mommas, don't let your babies grow up to be materialistic.

       I am in constant evolution. Every day is new and exciting. Lots of things are happening. So much has changed in my mind even during the past few weeks. But to stay present for a moment, I am currently feeling sad and confused. Why does my love life suck? So I’ve identified that my current weakness is in following-up, at least when it comes to career stuff. But in love I’m FOREVER following up, usually to no reply. Maybe writing will be my cure.

       Stupid-over + twenty first graders = I've had better mornings. Lately I've been waking up at 6 or 7 am, meditating and walking and eating breakfast in the morning, leisurely getting to school on time for a change, or working productively in my little yoga studio/home office. Today, as a result of last night's debauchery, I was groggy and dumb when I rolled out of bed with 20 minutes to get ready and get myself to Cupertino, to an elementary school that was recognized by neither Yahoo! Maps nor Mapquest.  I made it though, just as the bell rang. Now it's all about repetition. "Open your ears, close your mouths." "Quiet please." "Less talking, more writing." This group is very chatty. It's Friday. I can do this.

        Thanks be to Google   For the past several years we have all seen the internet snowball before our very eyes. I think it was 1996 when my tech-savvy girlfriend helped me set up my first Hotmail account. Then in college another computer scientist pal (I seemed to be surrounded by them!) referred me to this newfangled thing called Google for all my search engine needs.   As an advertising copywriter I was given the unholy assignment to write and edit white papers for Hewlett-Packard's division of imaging and printing documentation management services...or something. I remember reading analyst quotes about how the volume of information in the world is doubling every five years and thinking,  is this a good thing ?  I liked information as much as the next guy but this was ridiculous. Overwhelm, entropy, chaos. What can we believe? What sources are valid? Trustworthy? How can we possibly begin to process anything with all the ads and spam and data and reports and stuff being hurtled our way incessantly? And WHY do they have to put "e-" or "i-" in front of everything? And WHO are "they"?   I'm feeling lucky  When I packed up and moved to the San Francisco Bay area the second summer after college, I dreamt of being a full-time yoga instructor but knew it wouldn't happen overnight. Literally within a few days of arriving on the West Coast, I landed a job at the Googenheim itself. GOOGLE.  Decent pay, free lunch, all the soft drinks you could swallow, healthcare, hammocks and babbling brooks in the landscaped lawn surrounding the office complex. For a while I convinced myself it was corporate heaven on earth.  I was hired as a temp in the advertising department. Though the company was prestigious -- who doesn't know and love Google? -- the job was mundane, robotic, unbearable. Sixty other temps and I would review teeny text ads and their corresponding websites against dozens of random policies on everything from grammar to product claims to acceptable versus rejectable pornography. Yes to girl on girl. No to S&M.   Our managers emphasized "quality," whatever that meant but what it came down to was a sheer numbers game. How many ads could you review, correctly, in the eight hours of mind numbing screen staring Monday through Friday? I was a caged monkey with a blistered index finger. The other temps lived in constant fear of being laid off, and the flies were already starting to drop. I was invincible though. I had five years of advertising agency experience under my belt. They'd be crazy to let ME go.  Within three weeks I was fired because I treated it like a game. How fast could I go? And I refused to kiss ass. Hindsight is 20/20 but at that moment, I was utterly shaken. I  wailed . My ego was bruised, my root chakra punctured.  What am I going to do now? How am I going to survive without a regular paycheck?    As it turns out, being released from my duties at Google was the best thing ever for my career. The next morning I woke up elated.  I don't have to go to work!  I blanketed Silicon Valley with my yoga teaching resume. I took jobs of varying degrees of oddity to pay the immediate bills. Valet, caterer, limo driver, receptionist, cashier, substitute teacher, medical guinea pig. At the same time I was half-heartedly running four businesses -- my brainchild, Yoga Freedom; a new network marketing venture; an online furniture store; and an educational non-profit. I was overstretched and underpaid.   The yoga gigs came in slowly but surely, enough to where I was able to phase out some of the more heinous employment. Then it went to the other extreme. At one point I was teaching ten or twelve hatha yoga classes each week. Now I was  really  overstretched and my hip flexors had had enough. I was putting all my energy outward and none inward. You know what they say: if you don't go within, you go without. Burnout was imminent.  I quit some of the yoga classes and vowed to take more time for myself, my personal yoga and meditation practice, simple pleasures like walking the dog and watching sitcoms and getting a pedicure. And reading. Oh how I read! Novels, short stories, self-improvement books galore, magazines, websites.   I had come full-circle when I began posting my own Google ads. I clicked 'submit' and sent a little vibe of pity to the poor peon who would be reviewing my ad at the other end.

       I am doing so well, it's almost scary. I can't really fully describe what's going on but I'll do my best. It started a couple weeks ago when I was driving myself to San Diego for a Usana convention. I was feeling down and discouraged and negative (about Usana and other things, like "Life is too much of a struggle. Maybe I'm not on the right path.") Inexplicably, I sensed a shift somewhere along Interstate 5 south. I started to feel like everything WAS right for me, I WILL succeed, Failure is not an option. So then the meeting in San Diego further confirmed those feelings.   April 20th, I went on a 3-day personal meditation retreat at Green Gulch Farm, a Zen Buddhist center near San Francisco in Marin county. I was getting up at 4:30 am and meditating for 90 minutes in the morning with a bunch of Buddhist monks! In the mornings I would work (doing dishes, cutting vegetables) and in the afternoons I was free to walk to Muir Beach, do yoga, read, write, whatever! It was wonderful. Not without issues though. After San Diego I had approached Tim about Usana. That was another huge breakthrough for me. I realized that I had a HUGE fear of rejection (by him, and by everyone!). That's why I haven't told that many people about Usana. He was receptive. But regardless, I felt so invincible after approaching him. Then he told me that he and his new girlfriend are backpacking in Europe together this summer. I said, "That's cool. I'm really happy for you." But, during the retreat his image kept coming into my mind. He and she in bed, in Finland, whatever. It was very haunting. Even more disturbing - it had been over 9 months since we broke up -- why was I still harboring these deeply jealous and hurt feelings?! Well, I worked with that for a while in my meditation, just trying to have compassion for those feelings and accept them in order to release them.  OK, next (after the Zen retreat) was the New Living Expo, a conference of all things spiritual/healing-related in SF. Two of my favorite spiritual authors, Dan Millman and Shakti Gawain, were giving workshops there. I met Dan and he signed my book. What a thrill! I also met Ken, a photographer who randomly treated me to a massage by one of his friends at one of the 300 booths (everything from tarot readers to wooden trinkets from Tibet to "magic fountain of youth" bottled water was at this crazy conference). Well, this massage was like none other. I laid down on the table and Laura (the therapist) did her thing. I began to feel all kinds of release. Images of different people and things came up. My hands started to tingle. When it was over, I literally couldn't walk for 10 minutes. As it turns out, Laura not only does Swedish massage, but also Reiki and psychic/energy work. No wonder!  I also became re-inspired to write a book. I have been an avid writer since age ten or so and began writing a novel in college. But it was just bits of stories floating around with no continuity. I put it down, blaming writer's block. Well, the new book concept is called  Ten Dozen Gurus  and this is it in rough draft form. It's about spiritual materialism and information overload. How to sort through the gurus, if you will. How to walk into a bookstore or library without getting overwhelmed. When I was in the novel writing stage, I'd go to bookstores and just feel completely belittled by all the titles on the shelves. I'd think, "there are already a zillion books about everything. What could I possibly have to contribute that anyone would care about or benefit from?" This is it.  Finally, last week I was back to "real life." I guess it's because of the ridiculous amount of meditation I was doing, plus not letting myself work or make TO DO lists as I ALWAYS do, but when I got back into action it was amazing. I have been sleeping less (4-6 hours a night instead of 8) because I have so much energy. I am losing weight, I've been eating mostly raw foods, I quit being a pothead and sometimes I feel high anyway. I organized my closet and my office, redesigned my vision for Yoga Freedom, and I'm writing creatively again. Everything is not perfect but I am at this incredible level of motivation, productivity and happiness. I realize all things must pass but I definitely know that these shifts in me are going to have lasting effects.

        The Chris Crises   "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former." - Albert Einstein   At the risk of sounding like a Chris-monger, I must admit that I have had eight relationshippy experiences with males named Chris. Seven horribly bad and one which is currently underway and so far so unbelievably good.  Chris 1 was basically a child molester. I was 14, he was 22. Sickening.  Chris 2 was older too, but at least only 18. I was 15. He invited me over to a small party at his house and fed me screwdrivers with cheap vodka. I got uncontrollably drunk for the first time there. He was my first kiss. We went into his bedroom and fooled around. Then, his best friend, Chris 3, entered the room. So there I am, naïve and drunk and hooking up with two guys at once. It was cool but a bit too much for me to process. The doubling up only lasted five minutes until Chris 2, the one I actually liked, left the room. Chris 3 basically forced me to go down on him, which I had never done and neither knew how nor wanted to. I gagged. Disgusting.   Chris 4 was minor, just a friend’s boyfriend who toyed with my emotions and cheated on her with me. If you consider kissing cheating.   Chris 5 was my prom date. Not a boyfriend, just a friend. My circle of friends gathered at V's house. All the girls dates trickled in, but mine was MIA. I ended up sitting alone with everyone's parents waiting after everyone had left for dinner. I drove myself downtown, sobbing hard along the interstate and found my way to the restaurant. I walked into the room we had reserved. Party of 30. I had composed myself but seeing all the happy couples was too much. I started crying. All the girls rushed up and took me to the bathroom. It was pretty classic. They were all reassuring me and being very sweet. He eventually showed up, three hours late and with no good excuse. I hate the prom!   Chris 6 lived in my dorm in college. He was a charismatic film student who resembled Brad Pitt and Benecio del Toro. He knew it too. I had a crush on him for over a year! RIDICULOUS. No serious drama there, but still. His name is Chris!   Chris 7 was my one jaunt with a younger man. He was twenty. My friend’s younger brother. He started sleeping over but we never made out or even kissed. It was just what I needed at that point. But then his innocent idealism began to annoy me and we ultimately had a bit of a falling out.  So the uncanny Chris pattern became a joke in my love life. Any guy named Chris was shot down instantly. One more snuck in though, the one from the plane a few weeks ago. He told me his name and a red flag went up. Luckily he goes by Christopher. He has somehow has managed to redeem the name, though obviously I will  never  call him Chris for short. (I hate Chris!)   This is it. The Chris jersey has been officially retired, sorry, no exceptions. Eight is enough.

        Airborne Encounters   Over the years I've met a few fascinating folks on airplanes. It all depends on my mood. More often than not, I am wanting to read and nap and be antisocial. There's always a feeling of fatefulness though. Paths crossing. Same airport, same airline, same destination, same row even. In 1999, on my ten hour flight home from a semester in London, I met Adam, a young lad from Glasgow. He was on his way to Houston to visit his family. I gradually deciphered his accent and we got on quite well. I even went to visit him the following year. Of course I had a crush on him and he treated me like a sister.   Just this year, on a flight from Austin to San Jose, I met a soldier who was just returning from a year in Iraq. He was drinking like a fish. I even bought him a beer because he had reached his limit according to the stewardess. It was a most fascinating conversation. I wish I had tape recorded it. Despite hearing reports on the mainstream news media, the reality of war never really hit home. So I began asking questions like where did you sleep? (Outdoors, often) What did you do? (He happened to monitor the radar screen for enemy fire.) Was was the worst part? (The bitter cold.) Did you drink? (Yes, apparently they could get liquor from the Iraqi people.) He also told me about his platoon-mate who went crazy and shot himself in the head but somehow survived. This is one guy with a reasonable drinking problem.  A couple weeks ago on my trip to Texas, I sat next to a woman from San Jose who happens to work for a Mountain View software company I had solicited for corporate yoga. Her boss is the HR director whom I have been trying to reach for months. An in!  On the return flight to CA, from Austin to DFW, my row mate was a middle aged man from Round Rock, my hometown. He happened to attend Champion Fitness, a gym where I used to teach yoga. He told me that the former owner (whom I met a few times and always found creepy) had been incarcerated for putting hidden cameras in the ladies locker room. Apparently all this went down at the time I worked there about two years ago. Somehow I had been unaware. Luckily I never got naked in that dressing room. I think. The real crime occured when the gym owner posed as a photographer and had women over to his home and then secretly videotaped them changing. One of the girls was fourteen. Hello jail cell.   Finally, after my two hour layover at DFW I was spaced out and at the end of the line. Out of the corner of my eye I saw a cute guy line up behind me. We struck up a conversation, ended up sitting together against our seat assigments and talked the entire four hour flight. Now we're dating and spending 98% of our free time together. Let's hear it for American Airlines flight #1187, Group 5.

        A Slight Change of Plans   Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans. -John Lennon  The last two weeks have been a whirlwind of activity. I spent most of it in my hometown, Austin, seeing everyone I have ever known in my life who still lives in Tejas. (All my exes live in Texas. Okay, not really but most of them.) Since I started writing a book on dating several weeks ago, the past is right here in my face, complete with screwed up relationships, lessons learned and not learned, and past loves galore. I am far from a dramatic chick, but have been juggling my rage and melancholy with laughter and a sense of contentment.  Prior to yesterday I was planning to move to San Francisco in September indefinitely. After being in Austin for the fourth time since I moved last July, I realized that I want to live there too. So I hatched a plan to live here in the Bay area in the summer and there in TX in the winter. Whenever that is financially feasible, which should be 2005 or 06. Exciting? Yes. Further, I have been wanting to go to India for years and the time has come. In September when my lease ends, I will become a nomad for a few months. I will be flitting around California, Utah and Texas. I plan on touring India for 4-6 weeks in October/November, coming home to Austin in November/December and moving back to SF in December/January.   Sometimes it seems so futile to make a plan such as this. Life never goes as planned. But it's a blueprint. I'm a yogi. I'm flexible.

       A quote from  The Power of Now  by Eckhardt Tolle. “The misuse of the word/concept of God gives rise to absurd beliefs, assertions and egoic delusions such as ‘My or our God is the only true God, and your God is false.’ ... No word can explain the ineffable reality behind the word, so the only question is whether the word is a help or a hindrance in enabling you to experience That to which it points.”  I’m not personally against the word God, but I totally agree with Tolle’s statements. How can God be narrowly defined? Is it just human nature to want to be right and have a single, neat answer choice which allows for no other options? The other day at a Zen Christian meditation, I had a strangely geometrical visualization of a bright ball of white light, floating in nothingness. I imagined people, or lines representing people’s energy, approaching and entering the ball of light from all directions. I felt very comforted by that because it reinforced my deep seeded feeling that there are many paths to the Truth (a.k.a. God).   Thinking about it the next day, I realized that logically, a single individual can only approach the sphere from one direction. But there are still other paths going to the same destination. So there is the need to balance the undying faith in one’s own path (which of course is never a straight line) with awareness of and respect for other paths as well. Certainly there are still paths that don’t lead to the light, but the main, ancient world religions, in my humble opinion, all qualify, at least when practiced in the spirit of pure goodness.  Then again, I wish I could avoid having to project into the future, to grasp for some sense of security that everyone is okay and will end up in heaven or enlightened or whatever. If I could do that, I would really be invoking “the power of now.”  Because naturally we don’t know and never will. It’s just a hope, and an optimistic one at that. But clinging to it makes even such a lovely notion turn into something self-righteous and detrimental.
