      Set up The Booksmith blog. It was easy. And so here goes - the first entry!  Tomorrow evening (March 5, 2003), The Booksmith hosts San Francisco author  urlLink Cory Doctorow . Cory's first book,  Essential Blogging , came out late last year. This blog is a nod to you.  At tomorrow night's event, Cory will be reading from his new novel,  Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom . Reportedly, more than 75,000 copies of the book have been downloaded from his website. A few customers have come into the store and mentioned that they have already read the book on their computer or PDA. Yikes! All those downloads will certainly impact sales. If we can sell one tenth of one percent of 75,000 . . . .  By the way, Cory has a nifty blog to which he contributes. Its called  urlLink boingboing , and makes for pretty interesting reading.

       urlLink David Sedaris  stopped by today to sign his latest incarnation,   urlLink Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  ...  Much laughter rolled out of the back room, where he signed his new book. When we see him, it's hard for us not to crack a smile -- even if he's just standing by us, hinting at nothing.   I wonder what it's like for David Sedaris to be surrounded by people who can't stop smiling & chuckling away the afternoon and night...well, he has a pretty good gig.

       urlLink M. John Harrison's  latest work,   urlLink Light  , now tops my favorite sci-fi list.  This has got to be one of the best sci-fi books in nearly fifteen years. (One of my  urlLink coworkers  aptly describes M. John Harrison as a "writer's writer;"  urlLink China Mieville  is influenced by his writings/Harrison himself.) It's due in U.S. bookstores by August 2004.  Absolutely brilliant!  Not only will this book be life-changing, but...  I predict that  Light  will nearly single-handedly change the very nature of  urlLink modern physics .

      As we wrap up the month of Bloom's Day, I would like to steer your attentions to another astounding Irish work:  At Swim-Two-Birds  by Flan O'Brien. I'd not hesitate to put this one right up there with  Master and Margerita  and  Confederacy of Dunces  as being one of the funniest, literate and clever novels I've had the good pleasure read. It's a meta-novel, a novel about a fellow writing a novel about a fellow writing a novel in which the characters rebel against their author and start writing a novel of their own. It also features a fine array of absurd side-players including an Irish demon known as the Pooka, an invisible Good Fairy, the hero Finn MacCool and some gunslinging cowpokes along with some of the finest examples of the English language ever put to paper. A hilarious and melodious read through and through, but sure to puzzle not a few. Give it a shot if you dare, by Gorra.

      Sad news: Poet and longtime Booksmith customer  urlLink Carl Rakosi  has died. He was 100 years old, and had last visited the store about a month ago, when he bought a book of poems by Rumi.     Rakosi was born in Berlin in 1903, and moved to the United States as a young boy. His first poems appeared in magazines such as "The Nation" and "The Little Review" as early as 1925. Rakosi was associated with the Objectivist group of the 1930's, and his work appeared in the earliest group anthologies. For many years Rakosi worked as a psychologist and family counselor and published little. After his retirement, he returned to poetry. His  Collected Poems  were published in 1986, and his  Collected Prose  in 1988.

       urlLink Alex Garland  is here tonight;  urlLink Z.Z. Packer , actually, is interviewing him about his latest tome,  The Coma .  They're discussing the difference (if any) between waking and dreaming life.  We don't really want to hear about other people's dreams. Alex Garland admits that. He also pointed out that when we do talk about our dreams, we often lie, embellish a bit...make them sound crazy and fun. Garland said that for  The Coma ,   "...more than anything I've ever written, I tried to strip the language down to total clarity."  ------  There are illustrations in  The Coma  by Alex's father, Nicholas Garland (political cartoonist). They're dreamy/haunting & look like woodcuts...  ------

      Last Fall we hosted  urlLink J. Otto Seibold  for an author event to celebrate the publication of his new book, a pop-up version of  Alice in Wonderland . Now, here is the  urlLink book as a Flash app . Check it out!   urlLink     Also, here is a pic of an Alice tattoo on the arm of Booksmith employee Kasia. She is, needless-to-say, a big fan of the Lewis Carroll books.

       urlLink Andrei Codrescu  ran back into the store this evening - we joked, "You know, Andrei, your event is over..." He was in the store to buy a copy of his book for the bartender across the street at  urlLink Zam Zam . The bartender had quoted a line from Andrei Codrescu's poetry and then had bought everyone a round of drinks. Andrei nearly had tears in his eyes.  "And the drinks aren't cheap!"

      Last Friday, Chuck Barris kicked off a week's worth of remarkable events at the Booksmith. Barris - the one-time host of the "Gong Show" - was both funny and elegaic, and once again he neither would confirm nor deny that he was a CIA operative. Here is a picture of Chuck Barris at this most recent Booksmith event.     Also happening this week at the Booksmith: on Monday, NPR commentator Andrei Codrescu reads from his new novel,  Wakefield ; on Tuesday, Robert Bly reads from his just released selected translations,  The Winged Energy of Delight ; on Wedenesday, we celebrate a new anthology,  The Paris Review Book for Plains, Trains, Elevators, and Waiting Rooms  with contributors Denis Johnson, Junot Diaz and Paul Hoover ( Paris Review  editor Brigid Hughes will provide the introductions); and on Friday, Alex Garland (author of  The Beach  and  28 Days Later ) will discuss his new novel,  Coma , with bestselling author Z.Z. Packer.

       urlLink Barry Paris  mentioned on his radio show yesterday that his long awaited biography of  urlLink President Franklin Pierce  will likely be published in early 2005. (Paris' editor, I believe, is Robert Gottlieb, who edited the just released memoir of President Bill Clinton.)   Barry Paris has written a handful of notable books, including wonderful film biographies of  urlLink Louise Brooks  and Greta Garbo. Not sure what the Pierce bio will be called, but I have seen it referred to as  Pierce in Oblivion . I can't wait to read it.   Since 1981, Barry Paris has co-hosted the "Sunday Arts Magazine" on radio station  urlLink WQED  (89.3 FM). The program, which airs weekly and covers the Pittsburgh, PA. classical music / cultural scene, can be heard Sundays at 4:00 pm Eastern Standard time. I listen to this program over the internet.

      Way to go, August: One of our regular 'Smithees and local poets,  urlLink August Kleinzahler , stopped in this morning to buy the June 20th NYT Book Review. Page 17 of this week's review highlights the   urlLink Griffin Poetry Prize  ...which August has just won (along with Anne Simpson)!  Isn't that cool...  (now he doesn't have to work in a coffeeshop)

       urlLink Marlon Brando  has died. Just a few days earlier, The Booksmith hosted an author event with National Book Critics Circle Award winning writer  urlLink Joyce Johnson , who read from her just published memoir,  Missing Men .   When Johnson was a young girl, she recounted, she appeared in a couple of Broadway plays with Brando, one of which, "I Remember Mamma," was one of the actor's earliest roles. Johnson spoke of Brando ("He chewed ice") and remembered him fondly, including the time when the budding actor of 18 carried the future writer of 8 across the stage.

       urlLink Christopher Moore  is speaking tonight...right now, as a matter of fact. He's here for his latest tome,  Fluke . Chris Moore is really hilarious - at certain times, the audience howls with laughter.   Before he started his talk/rant, he gave away a couple of books...he'd read them & just didn't have any more room in his pack. "Who likes  urlLink Jane Smiley ? Moo? Okay, ma'am, it's yours." He also gave away a book by  urlLink Thomas Lynch . (The cool thing: Chris Moore signed his name in those books!)   Highlights: He wore  urlLink Ray Bradbury 's nametag at last year's BEA convention (in LA). Why? He has the same editor as Bradbury & really wanted to meet him, but his editor just gave him the nametag. ("She said, 'Yeah,  right .'") So, at an evening event for just the authors, he wore the nametag...Needless to say, Chris Moore got a lot of doubletakes, so he finally told authors, "Got that time travel (taken care of)!"  ...And former  urlLink President Bill Clinton  was also at the convention. "People were sobbing, 'He spoke in full sentences!'" An author who sat next to him (who has written a very well-known career guide) leaned in to Chris and said something like, "I'll offer him two Monicas to come back as President."  ------------------------------------------------------------ Check out Chris Moore's  urlLink blog .

       urlLink Owen Wilson  dropped in today, looking for the NYT newspaper. There was a rumor we were sold out...but it gave me an excuse to wander to the NYT box, wheel slowly around and eye him surreptiously. Yes, it  was  Mr. Wilson himself. He wore a non-descript baseball cap & kept his head low. But we knew who he was, anyway.   Actually,  urlLink Thomas  pointed him out first, then Kasia understood what/who he meant & silently squealed.(How do you 'silently squeal?') I didn't understand the fuss until Owen Wilson walked up to the front counter and asked if we had any remaining copies of today's NYT. Oh, that nose, that chin, that drawl...oh, I get it.  He bought a copy of  urlLink Surfing Magazine . I took it very calmly and asked if he wanted a "carrying receptacle." (why, why)   I wish to make it very clear I did not touch his hands as I gave him his change. Ok? Because, at that point, I had forgotten his name & he was just that "actor with the drawl."  Kasia finally let out an actual squeal when Mr. Wilson left the store.  Thus ends the Wilson Saga.

      The new China Mieville book,  Iron Council , has&nbsp;at last arrived !!!&nbsp; There is considerable interest among staff, and customers, about this new novel. We sold a copy within thirty minutes of putting it out on display.  China will be at the&nbsp;our store&nbsp;to read from  Iron Council  on Thursday, July 29th. This will be China's third&nbsp;appearance at the Booksmith, as we had hosted him for his prior two books,  The Scar  and  Perdido Street Station .  p.s. to all weird fiction fans:&nbsp; China Mieville's remarkable essay on the "Polish Poe" - Stefan Grabinski - can be found on-line on the  urlLink  Guardian  website .&nbsp; (Won't some publisher bring out a big collection of Grabinski's short fiction?)  &nbsp;

      Music and the Booksmith:  Recently&nbsp;playing the  urlLink Semisonic  cd " Feeling Strangely Fine ." Jacob Slichter, drummer for the band,&nbsp;appears at The Booksmith on July 27 to read from his music biz memoir  So You Wanna Be a Rock n Roll Star . "Closing Time" is certainly one of the great singles of the last half-dozen years.  More music and the Booksmith:  In the backroom, we sometimes listen to internet radio, especially those stations found on  urlLink Live365 . One favorite&nbsp;is  urlLink RadioLulu , which features "all things Lulu" - the music of the Twenties through today. Included are theme songs from the films of Louise Brooks, songs by the actress' contemporaries, friends and co-stars, show-tunes and standards, vintage jazz, as well as contemporary pop songs about the silent film star. Everyone from George Gershwin, Josephine Baker and Marlene Dietrich to Orchestral Manoeuvers in the Dark and Soul Coughing are highlighted on this unique station.   &nbsp;  &nbsp;
