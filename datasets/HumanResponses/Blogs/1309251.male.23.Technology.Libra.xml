      It took a long time to publish my blog.It,rather is a long time between the first and one that is published now.This period of hibernation was not because that,I was busy during this time.But,it was due to the fact that I nearly forgot about my  blog account.  How did  I really remember about this one? Why should I remember about this one? The difference between the status of my first and only blog and the present one is,that,I was jobless and had a lot of time to browse about blogger.com.  Now,I have the same free time ,but with a job of more responsibilities and less work.I can blog for hours without being disturbed.  I am still waiting for a high point in my life to occur,because,I can't see myself sitting in front of the computer doing nothing.I am thinking for a job change ,but in a software company as a programmer.Even that requires sitting in front of the computer for longer hours than now.But,I will be paid better and atleast won 't get bored.  I will get my head tonsured ,if,I could get a pay 4 times my present pay.

      Whenever ,I start writing these blogs under each heading,my mind turns in to a different mode.My other blog "my mistakes?!! " contains explicit crib.I start to crib about crib about everything and finally add that everything was my mistake.  Everytime,I open the "views" ,my mood changes to a different mode.I start writing about women.I start to scream in my mind " I am becoming a sex maniac".Wherever ,I go,people watch porn.So,I start watching too.Then ,every naked woman looks awful and boring.  In every post of my "views" ,I criticise a woman.I think ,I  am becoming more of a male fanatic than a lover.  My mind has become a paradox.I will just explain it to you ,what it is. When I look at a woman from a distance ,I imagine that this woman ,I am looking at to be a gorgeous and a perfect woman in every respect.But,when I get to  one,my mind starts to dislike that lady.I never mentioned this to anybody because,anybody who hears this could say that,I am crazy.There is only perosn who knows about this ,my colleague Ajay.I told him about this and he said" your mind denies what you want."  I know that,I create my own fantasies and when these are not fulfilled,I start to dislike what I have.  Ajay is a strong guy,in the sense that,he can acknowledge reality.He knows the things he can't do and what he can.He dissects everything and presents real facts which sometimes are diturbing.These facts ,just deny you of dreaming.Realism,when presented the hard way restricts you from proceeding further into achieving your dreams.When hard realistic without any solutions are presented by most unsuccessful people becomes hard to digest.  I started to begin the quest of studying people and their reaction to situations as a way to go through people to achieve my own benefits.Now,when ,I am at the middle of my study,I have to study my own reactions.It just makes me feel that Iam a different person altogether.  Studying my psyche,I began as a boy,a fat boy,fat gay,then a slim gay and then again to a boy I really imagined was.This cycle left me to wonder whether ,really ,I am a male or just pretending to be a guy just for the sake of the society ,I was a part.I just prepared a theory ,that every male begins and transforms into accorrding to their own success and failures.A loser starts to think negatively about himself and has delusions about what he really is not.while a successful guy thinks everything positive about him,and even feels that everybody should feel positive about him.In the back of his mind he knows his weakness.  I am positive about mycareer,but,my career doesn't seem to move forward.There are two people who have a stagnant life.The lift operator and the security guard who have a stagnant career.They just eat ,drink and sleep.I don't want to be anything like them.I just want to be a mover and shaker .I want to make a difference in everybody 's life.

      Girls will be girls .And girls are stupid.Thats what you should believe.Its not that you should fanatically follow this rule about the stupidity of women.But,follow it as rule to just understand them better.Never try to be too harsh with them,please.If a tiger ,whale or anyother animal needs compassion ,so should a female get a little bit of kindness from the males.  When , you say that "All women are stupid,and those who are not stupid are not women", you will find a woman say that ,"there is a girl here".How stupid can a girl get?  At an young age all girls are nearly are the same as boys.When they reach the start of their puberty ,they start becoming stupid.Stupidity in women cannot be defined.If you are not a female you will just know that they are stupid.It is just that ,the cuteness of their stupidity which attracts me.  You got to give them the credit for their stupidity.They create a wide variety of stupid situations ,you think you had passed through this situations before.Wait! you are in for a trap,this time they give you an altogether a different situation with a variation of the earlier one.  They are like computer viruses,they get installed into your computer without your permission and stall your activity by holding onto your data.They get to your address book and mail themselves to all your contacts. Women are like computer worms ,they come into your life undetected and keep replicating themselves until you cry out for space. When you try to remove your virus(women)they take something of value along with them.   Sometimes,I feel that a stupidity of a woman gets more obvious when she gets married .That's when her husband gets to know about her more.There are more than her knowing her innate stupidity.  Its not that she is born stupid.It is that she grows without knowing her capabilities  or the boundaries for being stupid.When a girl is born people bring her up in an environment  in which she it is usual for her to act stupid and the men are the people who should rack their brains.This is the start,where a female loses  her analytical ability ,the ability to reason. Females lose the ability to respond well under diverse of situations,because they are more in situations where they have the support of their family. More or less,the males are more of losers.Every diverse stare strongly in their faces.Family members always feel that men when they are in wrong situations,it is always his responsibility to come up with something as a break through. In this world ,it is just "Female stupidity Vs Male weakness".

      Another period of my life has gone without posting anything .I was trying to prepare myself for an interview with Siemens(SISL) at an entry level.My preparation was pretty much unorganised. I got very much excited and nervous about attending the interview that,I felt that such a large company would provide tough questions for an interview. The interview was on Monday.I went through all of C,C++ and protocol suites.The whole of saturday and sunday was wasted on those subjects.I was very much confident on JAVA ,because this was very much my domain.  I didn't get a copy of my re'sume' and found that cyber cafes don't open at 9.00a.m every day.So,I found my b-in-law on the road ,went to his office and took a copy . I boarded the bus and after walking for nearly 2KM found SISL in the interior of Gurgaon(should have called them for a landmark).The interview was at 10.30a.m.I entered SISL building and was called for an interview exactly at 10.30a.m. I thought ,companies in India shouldn't be that punctual.They should atleast follow the usual waiting game.I am pretty much accustomed to that protocol.  The people interviewing me were pretty much looked ike kids.The guy was floundering for questions and the gal looked somewhat odd.I had to write down most of the questions in  order to understand what the guy was asking about and the gal distracted me for most of the time.I couldn't answer some questions which were quite basic to me.Oh!my god !this girl has large things ,jutting out of her very interiors.Thats it! It was her teeth that distracted me. Well,she was supposed to ask me questions on database languages.But,I didn't write those in my CV.But ,she insisted on asking me something on databases.I told her ,i am very much ignorant about the databases ,except that I can just look on to the book to write the queries for a database.  I contacted the HR guy after 2 days .He told me the rejection of my candidature rather beautifully.It was like this "Your name has not featured in the short-listed candidates,but ,I will recommend your re'sume' to other companies".  There goes my first software interview after 2 years of waiting for one.

       I was sick last week.The doctor wasn 't quite sure what he was treating for.He sent me up for a dengue and malarial tests.It was blowing hot outside in Delhi.I was burning at 102 degrees,but ,by the time I reached the doctor,the temperature had shot up to 104 degrees.The doctor gave me an alternative ,get admitted to the hospital or he will adjust the treatment right away.  On Monday ,morning,I was feeling cold in my palm.I was just dabbling at the idea of going to work.My brother-in-law,had an early flight to catch at 7.00AM(I live with my sister and brother-in-law for the last 8 months after my employment).I just figured out ,that,it would be a terrible mistake to just go to my work place a rough 28KM from home.I nodded my head over everything my brother-in-law gave as instructions.The help maid was the first person to know that ,I was ill.By the time she cleaned the place and the utensils,my brother-in-law called.I told him to call my parents at Chennai(capital of a state in India called Tamil Nadu). I just made sure atleast an emotional support could be possible.I called up my office  to tell them ,I could not come.Still the manager was insisting that ,I come and explain everything to the backup engineer(I am an outsourced network administator).  The whole of Monday passed with the fever.The very next at 10.00Am ,my brother-in-law's office mate helped me with all the doctor and stuff.He even got me into their company's guest house. I was on a viscous rice solution for 2 and half days.The guy at the guest house was even bored seeing me eat the same thing everyday.I just told him that I will be leaving the guesthouse on Friday,before that I had a good north-Indian meal minus the oil.  I felt weak when I reached my home.I had bread and jam for breakfast,slept for a while and started cooking for my lunch.I sure was tired and my legs couldn't keepup with the pace .I called up my manager and told him that I will get to the office on Monday.He asked me to come on saturday.Just imagine how merciless and less human when normal workers become managers.They could just make things easier for everybody,but,no they  just want their work done.I told him that ,I was tired and weak to even go for field calls.  Even when your are not doing anything it is fun to just lie down in the sofa and sleep all day.

      I got a call  from Rahul,the manager who handles the metlife operations.He said ,come to CMS office Amar,I have something to talk.I knew this guy for only 2 months,and I can catch a whiff of what this guy was upto.I asked him,is it  for attending calls?   His tone  began to come down.He said ,he has a shortage of engineers and I need to fill the space.I couldn' t say no.I asked him the time at which ,I had to be there in CMS (he said he wants me at 9.30AM).I don't care a shit about this guy ,because ,I have to cook food and get out of the house.  I reached CMS on Saturday ,at 11.00 AM.Last time ,he said ,he doesn't want to hear my personal execuses.This time ,he asked me why i was late again.I said ,"sir,I don't want to bore you with my personal execuses ,and we could get on with the call".I got the place where ,I was to take charge from another guy in CP.  I reached JantarMantar and walked till Barakhamba to Gopaldas building.It wasn't too bad just 2 KMS.On reaching ,I had to wait for minutes just to board the lift and found IGL at the 14th floor.The guy ,I had to help was a lean and lousy guy from Noida.We played pool in the computer and saw porn together. He said,the other engineer used t guide him through the web and even allowed chatting.I got bored seeing porn .  I reached home at 6.30PM and started cooking .I had my supper with TV,then,studied JSP and slept at 12.00 at night. On Sunday,washed the clothes in the washing machine and had my brunch.I just watched movies and read JSP simultaneously.I drank chilled milk in the evening and bought milk. I even switched on the motor for water.I didn't forget anything thoughout the two days . I drew 3000 rupees on Monday and reached metlife at 12.00.The administrator at metlife, Delhi called up and asked the sales co-ordinator when I come to metlife every day.She sees me only at 11.00AM so she said so.I called  Kuldeep and he asked me why I was coming so late?I said that I come nearly and around 10.00AM.He said ,that the office starts at 9.00AM and I should be at 9.00AM.I didn't tell him,according to the contract the timings are from 10.00AM to 12.00 noon and 4.00PM to 6.00PM. The guy is going to come today and I am going to feel hell today.This guy is a calm looking guy ,with an aggressive mouth.His mouth chews paan,bubble gum and spits words of insult.I have blisters in my mouth due to eating channa-batoora on saturday.These are the perks you get when you work for a lousy company like CMS.  I Hope my mistakes soon get reduced and I start towards something worth to work for and cherish the experience for the rest of my life.

      I know ,that I shouldn 't follow orders until forced ,and I kept following .Whenever,I follow orders,I end up in a big soup. Last time I followed orders the messages in the Outlook Express of the manager was deleted and even the back-up was not taken. This time ,it is about the SQL server.I got a mail in my Outlook Express that I have to apply some .bat files and import the Master table.The mail came in the morning and I applied in the evening.I got a SQL server error.I called the administrator in Delhi and told him,that ,I got an attachment and upon application it shows an error.  He bounces back saying that I should have consulted him before doing anything.This happened on 27th May.On 28th the printer stopped talking prints ,I called the printer vendor.He came and diagnosed that ,the printer motor is not working.It seems one of the sales co-ordinators had sent a mail to the zonal co-ordinator and this fellow has mailed the same problem to Banglore head office.This co-ordinator in New Delhi called up immediately ,as soon ,I was issued a notification about the printer. The new tecnology has made my life difficult .He asked me whether the problem is to be locked  by me or by CMS computers.I said ,I had to take the real step.   On 27 th ,I got a chance to see my old colleague,Debjeet Bhattacharya.He was before a chubby faced and fat guy.I had reduced my weight after joining this company.But,this Debu had a large tummy,he had to hold his stomach whenever he had to make any changes in his postures.This is all because of the food from GECIS,Gurgaon.Everyday ,all of the CMS guys catch a bus to their sites,and it takes nearly 2 hours everyday for each us to just reach their destination.Debu has the most convenient of conveyance ,provided by GE.GE provide lunch and conveyance to their employees and support groups.  The life of an outsourced administrator is the worst thing that could happen to a person.I want to change my job profile from the Network/hardware guy to a software development guy.I had a call from my manager ,he says,since,I have a saturday off,I can come and attend the calls for CMS.He says ,there is shortage of field engineers.I have to go to CMS tommorrow.Its tough man.I hope ,I didn 't make a mistake.I should have done this SISL interview better.

      The whole week went from 17/05/04(Monday) went on very well.It means that nothing really happend worth mentioning.The daily routine of writing down reports starts much during the morning and continues till lunch .I usually send those wretched reports through mail before lunch.But, a mail usually comes back saying that ,"I need reports of the last ten days",or,"I want an elaborate report".It usually my methodology to just outwit the administrator.By the time ,the second reports are sent the administrator feels that,the second is more elaborate and more informative because ,he has to finish his end of the job.  On friday,as usual,I was browsing the web for study materials(this is what I do to  kill time).I got a call from my company,that ,a company called IBP 19 KM from Gurgaon,Haryana has a problem where a user cannot open his Outlook Express.As usual ,I had assumed that ,the computer would have software problems or it would have been due to patch updation.  The company called IBP was in Manesar ,another village near Gurgaon.On reaching the company,I found that there were many problems apart from which my group manager had warned me about.I just sat in front of a computer and tried to dial-up the remote server from a remote location(rather ironic isn' t it).I just tried using the hopeless connection for nearly three hours.It was 7.30PM when I decided to call it quits and phoned every guy connected with this site that there was some problem with the connection and was not able to connect to the server,due their own problems. When I got out ,it was very dark with a glimmer of light a few distance away.We usually have a public transport or few TATA sumos gathering people for a flat rate.They are actually people who may have a driver's license or drive this vechile for companies. By the time reached the bustop where I could get a direct bus to my place,it was 8.30PM.I boarded the bus which was supposed to reach my place,this was the time I felt that it is nearly 28KMs from my place and I travel everyday. I reached home at 10.00PM and started cooking for dinner.It was as usual salad and I don't have time for cooking anything . The most lousy part was that my CMS manager asked me to open the CPU and take out the MODEM.Since ,I operate alone he should have given me a toolkit.The toolkit was my right.He even asked me to come to the company to get the toolkit.  saturday. I went to the bank.I met a guy who had a badge on his breast pocket,which read"ask me how to reduce and gain weight".He introduced himself and said that he works for a company which sells herbal solutions for individuals with weight problems.He gave me his number and the people I have to call to be a member of the company. I reached CMS at 12.30 PM.I asked Monica(whom I was asked to contact for a toolkit) for a toolkit.Shesaid "did not the manager tell you something else?" call Rahul(manager)on his mobile.When I called him he started to get aggressive saying that I should have come earlier.I told him that ,he never said anything about  attending calls .He went onto another topic that I should never make Monica wait for me.I just told him that the bank opens at only 10.00AM and hence I was late. The lousy girl ,Monica,gave me two addresses to which I had to attend to.One of them had a faulty Floppy drive and in another I had to take the inventory details. I reached IGL(the place with a faulty floppy drive) and found out that ,they never had a faulty floppy drive and no one complained about it.I just got a little bit cross with Monica over  the phone. Next address was to sify ltd.I reached that place  after a long walk and found that another CMS guy had already done the inventory.My whole butt was aching by the long walks.I even met a guy whom I asked for instructions,after much talking he gave me his card,which said that he is a real estate guy. I reached home and had my dinner of youghurt and rice with ripe mangoes,lithchis and melons.I got a call from the neighbours in my hometown.They insisted that I go and meet them.They can't understand the fact that ,I had travelled the whole day,the day before.I was nearly forced to go and meet them,they are old people who just want to see and talk with people of their own language. I was as tired on sunday evening as I was on  saturday.They had come to be with their son a 41 year bacheolor. The whole fo the week was spent with the company of food and old people.I hope to find a better job,which required less movement and more of brain power. Every thing that happend this week was  my fault ,should have done the Siemens interview right.

       Being an outsourced system administrator without any real training is just waste of my time.I know now where all the companies lose their money,in unneccessary positions.  I know only to trouble shoot the network and take care of the system requirements ,update patches and anti-virus.This is no big deal .Anybody ,who has a decent knowledge of computer settings can do it.I am not the person,who did the networking in this place.I just have to detect the source of any error in the network.  I have to do an extra job of taking backup of anything that the users do. Well,my mistake began when,I got a mail from the region office to update Windows2000 patches,he also wanted me to do it before quitting. I just did it.I applied the patches to all the computers including the branch manager's . The next day,the manager calls me to his cabin and says" where are the mails,Iam just gonna lose my fucking job".I am caught in a fix.i called another Outsourced System administrator in another branch office.He told me that ,I have to just uninstall the patches to keep the Outlook Express working ,but the mails are lost forever.  I called the regional Administrator ,he says"You should have  tested it first before applying ,and,did you take the mail backup?" Oh,my god!I didn't take the backup,i mean do I have to take the backup? Well it all simmered down to after the weekend and a letter to their head offices saying that it was all my fault.  Ok,I don't have any problems taking the blame,as long as,the company outsources to my company.  Well,I have learnt a lesson.Always wait for others to take a step,before taking yours .You may never know!!!

      Trying times for a nobody.I was thinking about this ,am I going to die as a nobody? I don't have a fast and trying career ,where I had to break my head to stay in a company.This is what others are doing. You know what,lift operators and security gaurdsmen in my country are the only ones without any career.They just have a stagnant life,they reproduce and they die.  Since,the life of an outsourced administrator is no better.The manager here in the metlife site is forcing me to have an insurance policy.The catch, he has to sign the customer feedback form at the  end of every month.This is called harassment at work.  I get a phone call from my parents everyday,after my brief illness.Mother says it is dad who is worried about my health. First few days ,I cut up cucumber and tomatoes for salad.My brother-in-law insisted that ,I eat cooked food.When ,I started cooking potato ,I again got a call from my dad.This time was,I could get gas in my  stomach.  Still ,I am cooking potatoes.I watch a lot of T.V.Atleast a movie after coming back from work.I find it hard to start studying when working and cooking man.It is quite tough for a bacheoler.
