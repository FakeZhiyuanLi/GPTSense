      R-KOM stands for Raider Kick-Off Mentors, which I will go into in a minute. B-SMOM stands for Bureaucratic  Soccer MOMs.  There was an orientation at my high school today for all incoming freshman (me). A group of five students was assigned a mentor, who were all upper-class seniors and juniors. The thing was so poorly organized and excessive. All that was really accomplished was we got our schedules, student IDs and a T-shirt. Also we were shown where all our classes are. It could hava all been done in two hours, but they dragged it out. Then they dragged it back in, hit it over the head with a jumble of poorly coordinated loudspeaker announcements, and made  us  drag it the rest of the way out.  Phew.  Edit: Forgot to tell you what B-SMOM is. You need to have a tetnus shot to be able to go to school, right? (I guess they think some terrorist will insert a student infected with a contagious disease into the school and get everyone sick. I mean, what are the chances that you will actually catch tetnus. Let alone during you high school years. But a thousand monkeys. . .) Anyways, I got the shot, and it hurt, but the school never mailed us the damned paperwork that we have to fill out to prove that yes, in fact I  did  get the shot. A looong story short: me and my mom went back and forth between the school's main office, the gym, the nurses office, and a couple other places for an hour and a half before someone decided it would be best if we just came back on Monday.  Also, there's this really cute girl in my advisory (home room) class who used to be on my soccer team when I was about nine. And she remembered me. So.

      So today me and my friend made some Halo movies with a video camera and my Halo action figures. The movies sucked. Except for the funny parts. The movies might have been better if there were less funny parts. Because people who were laughing at the funny parts would laugh so hard that the missed the other parts. Which were also good. Heh. I guess the movies didn't suck at all. Oh well.

      Ok. Today I downloaded Warthog Jump and Warthog Revisited from www.warthogjump.com. Definately the most original and inspiring Halo fan video. Besides Red vs Blue. I also downloaded the following songs: Fly by Sugar Ray, Learning to Fly by Pink Floyd, Fly Me To The Moon by Frank Sinatra, Magic Carpet Ride by Steppenwolf, Purple Haze by Jimi Hendrix, and Song 2 by Blur.  I have just finished all the worksheets about The Chosen that I need to Complete for Honors English. And I've read some more Blake. The Little Girl Found this time.  So that's how my day went.  Edit: If anyone has an mp3 of Into The Breach from the Myth Soundtrack, please email me at thesoffish@yahoo.com.hk

      I've been reading Blake lately. I just finished The Marriage of Heaven and Hell. It was pretty good; I especially liked the Proverbs of Hell. And Cortana says: It will be more than a cart and plow that I drive over the bones of my enemies. Heh.

      So today I went to the optometrist, and I found out I need glasses. At least I'm getting them during the summer, so when I start high school at the end of the month, people will be all "Oh, he has glasses. Whoop-dee-doo." Whereas if I got glasses in the middle of the school year, people would be all "Oh, dude, you got glasses? You didn't have glasses yesterday. La-dee-da-dee-da." And there would be a big commotion over it. I also saw Star Trek: The Motion Picture today, the one with V'ger. I've noticed that alot of science fiction, like Halo and The Chronicles of Riddick tend to focus alot more on special effects and action. This is not neccesarily a bad thing, and yes, I know that Halo has alot of staggering philosophical vistas, but that's not the point. My point is that Star Trek tends to focus more on how humans react under extenuating circumstances, and it's alot more about. . . the human condition, for lack of a better term.

      I went camping. Now I'm back. Not much to say about it, I guess it was a pretty typical family weekend. I read The Chosen over the weekend. I think I'm going to read a copy of Jonathan Livingston Seagull that I have lying around, then I'll wait a week or two before I start God Emperor of Dune, so I can catch up on my programming. I'm working my way through Game Programming for Teens. It uses BlitzBasic, not C/C++, but it's the concept that counts. My friend tells me that the retarded teacher I was talking about got his house egged. Serves him right. I'm going to change the heading on the site. For posterity, the old one says "Welcome to here. What is the soffish? The very question is faulty. The soffish is cannot be an "is." The soffish is not an entity, an object, or even an effect. The soffish cannot be described, disected, or properly explained. It can only be located. It lives here." That was from Bungie.net when they desribed The Soul. For those who don't know, The Soul was banished to the depths of the Bungie.net metaservers for mislabeling some Marathon Infinity boxes. My new heading will be "Here is the blog that will forever be considered a triumph of the imagination. Set in the cyber world Internet, The Soffish is the story of the boy Carsen Berger, who would become the mysterious man known as the Soffish. He would avenge the traitorous plot against his noble family---and would bring to fruition humankinds most ancient and unattainable dream." That is from the back cover of my copy of Dune.

      So I got my bi-monthly free subsription to Game Developer magazine today, and it came with a disc with a bunch of ATI stuff from the recent Game Developer's Conference. Most of it is the ATI speakers, about OpenGL and stuff like that and is really boring, but it does have some cool QuickTime movies demo-ing stuff they're working on, like the Crowd thing that can animate a bunch (hundreds) of individual characters. It also has the Radeon SDK on the disc, which is awseome. But I'm obviously not an actual game developer yet, and by the time I figure out how to use the damn thing, it'll be out of date. Oh well. It's free.

      The jackass teacher from my previous blog has been sighted: he moved in almost next door to the friend who helped me make the website.  Also, my other friend saw him at the doctor's office where he was getting a physical. Why, we have no idea. He is fat and ugly, soI feel bad for the doctor.  He is turning up all over the place, just like chewed gum underneath tables and movie theater armrests.  My god. end of blog &amp;copy

      Notice the dancing Hobbes above. I replaced that dumb orange star. That's my homage to Bill Waterson. If you have any suggestions for how I could add more crap and/or crazy pictures to this blog, then post a comment.

      Well, it took me a while, but I got the 7777777 counter onto the sidebar. Over there -------> It's lucky I have this handy HTML book. My aunt gave it to me.  Also, I don't know what went wrong with the blog below this one. The text is f***ed up (bleeped for the benefit of those with heart conditions, and with parents over their shoulders) and the image didn't post. The image was the sevens counter.  Edit: The book is HTML 5th Edition For the World Wide Web with XHTML and CSS, by Elizabeth Castro. Hopefully no relation to the relatively evil Cuban dictator Castro. But if you need a HTML book, this is a good one. Go buy it. They give me a bucket of keychains for every 10 books I sell, so what are you waiting for?

                  You are internet user number     to view this site.    I'm going to see if I can use HTML to put this counter into the template/background thingy of this blog. This may prove difficult because I don't know HTML. But I do have a book about it...    Edit: Shit. What's wrong with the font.

      I thought you might like to know  brief history of me and the internet.  When I was young, around the age when kids usually like Lego alot, a had a web page on Lego.com, where you could post pictures of things you built and stuff like that.  Then I had several sites on Yahoo Geocities, most notably one where me and a friend pointed out how much of a bad teacher and also a jackass one of our teachers was. It was all done in a very humorous manner, of course. Sadly though, that site no longer exists. Many people laughed and mostly agreed with us, a few people got angry and yelled at us, and one person threatened us with a lawsuit. The lawsuit threat won out over the laughter. The whole ordeal ended with a "man-shake" between me and the teacher. If you are wondering, a "man-shake" is the teachers gay name for a hand shake.  Currently, I have a Geocities site that has my resume on it, but it is not up to date, and the site looks like shit. I am renovating it. Slowly. I am also a member of a few forums.  If the guys from uglyinternet.com (search for it on archive.og, it doesn't exist any more) saw this blog, they would probably say it is a waste of the internet. But they would also be suprised to know that I stole that idea about the ironic skark learning to surf from them.  So it all balances out.

      The most ironic thing in the world would be if a shark learned to surf to impress his friends, but he was so good at it that his friends thought he was a real surfer and they ate him.  My friend came over today. Mostly we played Halo. I also showed him Marathon. By the way, if anyone reading this has Marathon (via AlephOne) on their PC, IM me so I can play you online.  Dammit... I am currently uploading a picture to Photo Bucket, but it's hella slow 'cus my connection is only 56k, and I accidentally uploaded a picture of my brother instead of me. They have similar file names, you see.  So I need to finish Children of Dune tonight. I only have like 25 more pages. Then I have to read The Chosen for Honors English. I'm going into my Freshman year at high school, and I already have homework. It's still summer! But I digress.  I may or may not have an update tomorrow, because I have a Jujitsu class tomorrow night. And Tuesday I am spending the night at my friends house. Not that you care. If you do care, then you need to go out and get some friends of your own. I am not typing this because I need people to care about it. Nor do I want that ( well maybe a little).  Ah, my picture is uploaded... Now to add it too my profile. Incidentally, when you put dod dot dot after a word, like I just did, you are supposed to have spaces between the dots, like . . . and not like ... I learned this from the spell checker on Word Perfect.  Maximum file size is 50 k for the profile picture. Well that's completely gay. That is the sentence that first popped into my head when I saw that error.  Also, a program called Paint Shop Pro. . . If you ever download the free trial version, make sure to get version 5.01, because that version will not stop you from using it after the 30 day trial period  is up. I am currently on day 149 and still able to use it.  Right; picture resized, and presently is uploading. Then I will add it to my profile, and go finish my book.
