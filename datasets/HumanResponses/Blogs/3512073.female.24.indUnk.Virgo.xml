      I was up at Purdue this weekend and had such an awesome time. It was the Cactus, then to a house party, I love the rain *wink wink* to Pete. I would like to thank all of my friends...I know how lucky I am, you guys care about me so much.  Tina, you make me realize that I'm not stupid, and it's ok to make stupid decisions as long as I learn from them. And yes I did, a certain ex-boyfriend can go to hell.   Everything happens for reasons, I don't regret anything. And a side note...I'd like everyone at the party Friday night to know I'm a good girl. Promise! I'm normally an angel. If you don't believe me, ask Tina!  Hey I'm just out to have fun, and I will try very hard to not break any hearts, including mine.

      Today was really busy. I started out by faxing and mailing out resumes. Then I went over and finished painting my little sister's bedroom, put a border up and all. Looks good if I do say so myself.   The annual Fish Fry is next weekend, Yeah! I have also decided to go a the mission trip to North Carolina next month. We'll be working on a Cherokee reservation. I'll be an adult leader, should be fun.  Lastly, I am extremely upset about something. I believe that people take others for granted way too often. Someone shouldn't be tossed aside and forgotten just because things in life aren't working out the way we thought. When someone is hurting the most is not the time to ignore them. I am not strong enough to deal with all of this pain at the same time, it's too much and it's building up. I think that regrets are going to come too late in this case.   I'm going up to Purdue tomorrow (Thursday) for a doctor's appt. Hopefully they'll tell me I don't have Mono anymore. Then maybe people will stop treating me like crap.

      Well I went rollerblading in the neighborhood today, and ewww the nasty cicadas are everywhere! I LOVE my new rollerblades, gezz I can't believe I was using those abec 1's for so long.   I actually cooked dinner tonight for me and my Mom. Chicken noodle stew, brussel sprouts, and chocolate brownies, Yummy! We went rollerblading afterwards, it's nice to go at night when it's not hot and humid, and the cicadas are sleeping too.

      I am new at this online journal stuff...so here I go.  So, the Piston's pull out and kick our butt. That's fine we never seem to make it to the final round EVER. Went over to Shawn's with Janae to watch the game.  I convinced everyone to go eat at BDub's for dinner after the game...yummy Wings.  Took my car into Devonshire Auto today, I know somethings wrong, but I don't know what.
