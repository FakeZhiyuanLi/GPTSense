						   It's that time of year again.  The weekend where everyone goes, "oh yeah, there IS a state called Indiana!"  It's the weekend of the Indianapolis 500 Race.    It's also the weekend where traffic is crazy and, of course, we here in this LOVELY state are STUPID enough to start summer interstate construction last Monday.  So, not only is traffic heavy, but it is now severely clogged.  Those of us that have to live here and get to work (as opposed to those of us who are leisurely meandering to the race track) are stuck in traffic with a bunch of stupid people.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when there is 5 miles of warnings about the construction (i.e. LEFT LANE CLOSED AHEAD) and there are people that pull up at full speed in the left lane around the long line of traffic then feign ignorance when they get to the front of the construction and cut into line like they are more important than the rest of us trying to get to work that have been sitting in the line for 30 minutes!  That and the people you KNOW know better then get to the front of the line, squeeze into traffic almost taking out 2 cars and then flip you off!    Ok, that's my ranting and raving for the day.  Thank goodness we're getting out of town for the weekend!  Ken's enjoying his first day of summer vacation.  I've already received beratement for having the DVR set to tape Golden Girls and The Nanny between 8 and 10 this morning because he couldn't change the channel and watch anything else. (if you can't tell by now, Ken TOLERATES Golden Girls, but he absolutely LOATHES The Nanny.)  So, I guess we'll have to put that receiver in the bedroom so he can catch up on his Star Treck and Stargate-SG1.  Or, his Alien Love as I call it.  However, I'm lucky to be still moving for calling it that.  He gets angry because there was a commercial for a show that used the phrase Alien Love and now I refer to the whole Sci-Fi channel as Alien Love.  I guess I shouldn't complain though, as he does let me at least tape my shows given I watch them out of his presence.    Now that I've gotten myself into deep dog doo for even bringing it up (honey, please know I was just joking!), I have day 2 of bar review.  Torts.  At least its something I'm sorta good at.  Hopefully it will get out a little bit early like yesterday.    Plugging away, plugging away.    Have a happy three day weekend.

						   Count to three...breathe in deep...CONCENTRATE!  Today is the first day of state bar review.  I know I am getting out of the office at noon and I am having a hard time resisting the urge to burst out of here and scream "I'M FREE" - because I know I'm not.  I have to go to bar review.  I have to go to bar review.  I have to go to bar review.    If I say it enough, I will overcome this pull to direct my car home, fall to the couch, snuggle in a blanket and wish the world away while watching Golden Girls and The Nanny that I have (to Ken's annoyance) recorded on the DVR.    Alas, however, the world will not go away and neither will my need for the bar review, my need to face this fear I have going into the bar review, or the fact that I still do not have a permenant job.    Speaking of that though, I feel for the first time like I just don't care about the whole job thing.  I must be bordering on being deemed mentally insane.  Logically, I am terrified that I don't have a job secured and know that the one I have will come to a tragic end - an end of the money and the health insurance Ken and I desparately need.   The Robitussin CF/fatigue/allergy part of me says: Fuck it.  Lay on the couch all day.  Watch TV.  Waller in the feeling of unemployment.  It's ok to work at Wal-Mart with a doctorate degree!  Then there's the part of me that thinks its time for a career change before my career has begun.  Maybe I should go ahead and be that high school English teacher I had thought I wanted to be when I started college.  That posting for a private investigator for a large financial entity doing investigations on mortgage fraud is right up my alley.  I am PERFECT for that airport security job!  All posted positions in Indianapolis, but not a valid choice for someone as much in debt as I am from 3 years of hell.   So, my body goes on auto-pilot - I know I will get in my car.  I know I will go to bar review.  I know I will continue my Torts practice problems (of which I am doing very well on so far).    Ken's grades are due today and then he is off for his three months of student free bliss.  I'll have to have him bank some sleep time for me.    Maybe I'll get to go home and convince Ken to play Trivial Pursuit with me on the X-Box.  Just a moment to escape...

						   Ok, so things with my mom visiting didn't work out.  I was hoping to see her, but it did relieve some of the stress.  Ken was AWESOME last night in getting the house around, but we didn't have to kill ourselves to get it done.  Big Relief!  So, this allergy thing is really kicking my butt this time around.  We went to Meijer last night to pick up a few things and I found a bottle of Robitussen CF.  Had never taken it before, but it said it helped with cough and chest congestion (what has been keeping me up for the past week).  I also figured it couldn't taste as bad as the DM version my mother used to give me and my brother as kids.  Hopefully, I wouldn't be holding this version in my mouth until I got to bed and spit it out in my pillow. But, then again, I am no longer 6 years old.  So, I figured it couldn't hurt.  It didn't, but it sure didn't taste any better than I remembered either!  That was redeemed by the fact that it worked.  It worked TOO well and I could hardly drag myself out of bed this morning.  I've felt like a complete zombie for the past two hours.  Couldn't even fully tell you how I got to work this morning.  I remember getting into the car...dead memory...I remember merging onto 465...dead memory...I remember getting out of the car.  Well, it's not THAT bad, but you get the point.  Maybe I'll only take a half dose tonight.    Today is Ken's last day with students! WOO-HOO!  I can't wait until his grades are turned in and done for the year so that I can fully throw myself into this bar review thing.  I start state bar review tomorrow and have been reviewing my Torts outlines the last couple days at lunch and here and there when I have 5 minutes of time since that is the first topic.  At least it's one I enjoy and do pretty well at.    I need to get back to the same old same old.  Hopefully, I'll snap out of this and the world will be all clear again...

						   Hello everyone.  I have created this space as a sort of diary for life juggling a husband, a law degree, and the pursuit for an Indiana Bar Admission.  Jobs, bar review and my husband are the central focus of my life right now.  Maybe I  can give some insight through this space and maybe you can help me out too.  Anyone in this situation will know that this is almost a last-ditch effort not to (a) explode and/or (b) dig a six foot hole and crawl in it already.    Welcome.

						   Watch Strictly Ballroom.  Then tell me you don't want to be a pretty dancer with a partner like that!  Come on Ken! tap those toes. :)   I have not written in awhile because not much is going on.  Same old same old.  Working on Real Property now in Bar Review.  The bar exam is approaching rapidly.   No new job prospects.    Maybe I'll quit now and become a dancer...

						   It's only the middle of June and I'm about ready to have a mental and body overload.  This is not good.   Lately, I have been boardering on nearly psychotic complete exhaustion.  My mind isn't running on all go and my body is starting to rebel.  When I do get to lay down at night, I wake up more tired than when I first went there five hours before and I realize that I was defending criminals and reciting to them the elements, requirements and defenses of their crimes in true bar review fashion.  Either that or I was standing in front of Congress dressed in a foam costume shaped like Indiana and stating emphatically that they could not tell me what to do - unless they gave me lots of federal money to do it.  (woo-hoo, Constitutional Law Lecture).    So, I zombically wander this planet, driven by routine.  Someday, I'm just not going to get out of bed.  But as long as the guilt of responsibility remains alive in me, I will continue on. Continue on, I will.    So, I'm going to get away this weekend with Ken, going to Billie Creek for a civil war reenactment - one of the biggest of the year.  My parents took the dogs, but I had to meet them 3/4 of the way to their house with them.  So, I go to work yesterday, partially sleep through a Constitutional Law Lecture and go home to get my babies.  They are wonderful and I am travelling alone, so I don't put them in their seatbelts.  Belle was in heaven living her past as she slept on my left shoulder and Leo sat on my lap in the crook of my left arm.    They slept peacefully as I drove through the rain and the traffic, listening to my Criminal Law lecture on the CD player.  Belle started to softly snore.  Leo was occasionally sighing sweetly all nice and warm on my side.    The next thing I know my head is bobbing up and I'm disoriented.  It was just a split second, but enough to scare me.  I got all nice and warm with my babies with no one to talk to and I lost it.    Keep on, Keepin' on.  Please don't crash.  Body, get me through yet another day.

						   I don't know who sings this new country song, but I love the tag line.    Anyway - I'm going to need some help busting out of this lagging apathy that has overcome me.  I have learned so much this week in law review - all about tax law I never wanted to know.  The information is swimming in my head and I cannot make myself study more when I get home.  Just going over and over and over again in my head.  If Indiana were an alimony state, the alimony would be taxable to the donee, deductable to the donor - unless otherwise provided by the divorce decree.  You can only write off 50% of a business dinner and you must have documentation of what "business" transpired.  If your parents loan you $500 interest free, they are subject to "transfer of wealth" tax.    I feel like a writing major again.  It looks like I'm not doing anything, yet I have all this information going on in my head that I am working, reworking and getting straightened out in my own mind.  Ken's getting on me lately about my after-bar-review habits, but honestly I am working it all out.    Well, at least I get to see my friends this weekend.  We haven't all gotten together since October, so it will be good to see everyone.    Maybe that's the time to pitch my Judge Johns on Lifetime proposal....

						   Ok, so Ken finally got around to reading my lovely blog and, as predicted, I was right.  I am in the doghouse for calling attention to the Alien Love.  (Honey, as I said earlier, I was just kidding!)  I also realize now that I need to bust out of this rut and really get into studying for the bar exam.  I'm going to class everyday, but by the time I get home at night, I only have energy to hang out with Ken, watch TV and read my book.  Bad lawyer, bad.   If only life could be a simple and wonderful as in those trashy dime-store books anyway.  It's such a lovely escape.  This last one was about a young woman who taught at a one-room schoolhouse in 1918 in the middle of nowhere North Dakota and met the man of her dreams - a Norwegian immigrant farmer.  She taught school, he farmed.  She taught him to read, he taught her to survive outside her father's city store.  They fall in love, get married and get pregnant right away without even trying!  That, and money is never a challenge, they have no cares of what others think and they live happily ever after.  It's all SO wonderful.    Sometimes I wish things were that simple.  Where I could teach in a one rooom schoolhouse and be married to my farmer and have lots of babies without care for money.  I didn't always want to be an attorney.  Some days, I still don't want to be an attorney.  But, you get wrapped up in modern life with the expectations that lead to enrolling in school that lead to student loan repayment that lead to no escape and just having to eventually go through it.    Ken, grab the dogs, abandon the house and let's move to a log shack in Montana.  No...really.    I hate being an adult sometimes, but then again, I've been one since the day I was born. Back to the grind.

						   Well, it's yet another week of the grind.  Thank goodness it's a short week.  However, my internal clock is all screwed up.  As I was driving to work this morning, the guy on the radio made the comment that the week was going by so fast.  I got really excited because I was like, "one more day, just one more day".  Then, I realized it was Wednesday and not Thursday.  What did he mean the week was going by so fast?!  That, and I realized that it was Federal Income Tax day at bar review.  There was a reason I avoided that class in law school.  I don't want to be a tax attorney and don't understand why being required to know the intricacies of the the federal tax code is necessary to being a successful attorney.  So, bring on two days of tax - Federal Income Tax today, Corporate, Estate & Gift tax tomorrow.    It's days like this I wish I could go straight from the bar exam to a job as a county civil court judge.  That would be the perfect job - if I didn't have to write opinions.    In the never-ending quest for a job, I signed up with a professional placement service  yesterday.  One of the questions asked was "describe your ideal job."  Upon careful reflection, I figured out what I wanted to do with my life.  It was the great epiphany I have been waiting for.  However, I did resist sharing this information with the professional service.  I don't think 'Judge Judy' would go over very well, no matter how serious I would have been.    Imagine.  All the housewives, college students and unemployed would be talking about it.  Judge Heather Johns and her sweeping hand of justice in spite of the law.  I envision a combination of Judge Judy, Texas Justice and Divorce Court wrapped into one!  No disrespect to my favorite TV judge of all time - Justice Mablene Ephriam of divorce court.  Oh, to have her job!  Hmmm...Justice Johns... Wapner meets Judge Judy.    Somehow, I think everyone had something a little bit classier in mind for me.  If I had to be on TV, I think mom would love it more if I was a correspondant for Court TV.  I would have more fun being a TV judge though.  Maybe I can get on cable access. Or maybe I can type up a proposal to my favorite station - Lifetime.  "Judge Johns...reaping justice for battered women."  That actually sounds worthwhile.   So, I continue to look, continue to study.  Now, I just need to wake up from this ridiculous dream!

						   It's like a bad Saturday Night Fever theme:   SATURDAY NIGHT DELIVERY featuring the hit single "BABY INFERNO" - "burn, baby, burn. Baby inferno."  Everyone is having babies. BABIES BABIES BABIES  I am in BABY hell.  BABY HELL  BABY HELL  Dante would be proud.  I dreamed I was riding with Virgil and we crossed the river styx where, instead of heads of the damned, there were smiling happy fresh baby faces floating in the water, their eyes pointing at me and laughing.    Everyone is having babies.  I just found out another friend of mine is going to be an aunt.  She even may be a mother soon.  The Christian logical woman in me is happy and supportive.  The immature pop culture chick in me is like Michelle in Romy & Michelle: "I hope your babies look like...monkeys!"  Anyway, I am happy for you.  Congratulations.  I'd be happy to attend your baby shower.

						   I saw Gone With the Wind for the first time in my life over the past three evenings.    You ask, how does a grown woman at the old age of 25 going on 26 get to this point in life an not have seen the great sweeping dramatic epic that is the saga of Scarlett and Tara? Try growing up with parents that hate the movie.    It was not as terrible as my parents would have had me believe, but also, having been in reenacting, I see so much potential.  I know it won several awards, but I don't feel that Scarlett's character was developed at all.  There has got to be more to her than the annoying whiny voice and penchant for paying her debts with her body.  It took a strong woman to live through that time the way she supposedly did.    Oh well, Ken said his mother said that the movie was nothing like the book, so I guess that's the next logical step.    Today's bar review is Family Law.  Finally, something I'm familiar with.   As God as my witness, I will never take the bar exam again!

						   Today my baby boy is to get his teeth cleaned.  Never did I think there would be a day when I paid a doggy dentist.    Leo has been having some problems chewing lately.  He has even refused his favorite foods, which is any people food.    So, he's off to the local doggy-spa for the royal treatment.  For $30, he's in for a day of:   1.  Luxurious oatmeal bath 2.  Massage 3.  pedicure 4.  ear cleaning 5.  teeth cleaning 6.  hair trimming 7.  brushed 8.  facial (remove his tear stains) 9.  Deoderizing cologne 10. Bandana  Wouldn't it be nice?!    Oh, and lest you think we have left Belle out of the deal, she is getting everything except the teeth cleaning.  She isn't killing us from across the room yet with her breath.    Ok, so back to the grind.  We're on MPT review in bar review today.  Kill me now, the bar is less than 3 weeks away...

						   The results are in for all of you Lifetime TV lovers (or haters).    The Nanny and Golden Girls tied with 25% of the vote each.    Obviously, I must have more than one husband because "None, I'm your husband and I hate that channel" got 50% of the vote!   NOW cowboys and cowgirls, we have a new poll.

						   Ok.  So the search continues.    I never thought I'd do this, but I just applied for an attorney position with the Indiana State Public Defender.    Actually, the job sounds really interesting, working with post-conviction matters.  Basically, from the description, it is assisting the convicted in obtaining new trials or sentence reductions by enhancing or finding legal errors in the original trial.    Pay's pretty good, but again, never thought I'd do that.  I guess I always saw myself as being a prosecutor if I had to do criminal law.  Seiging my way to justice, one criminal at a time.    Never did I think I'd be in a position to utter the phrase, "I know you killed your wife...but, because your original defender failed to object to the admission of  your _____, you'll be out in no time!"  Now, if only I can get an interview!  perhaps, perhaps, perhaps...

						   Only in Indiana would the north, the south, the hillbilly and the ugly all clash.  Check this out, courtesy of the Indianapolis Star today:     Muncie's Confederate flag ban challenged Associated Press August 11, 2004 MUNCIE, Ind. -- The Indiana Civil Liberties Union has filed a federal lawsuit challenging the ban on Confederate and other flags at a city-run campground saying it is a violation of the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. The city created the ban on all flags except the American and POW/MIA flags at the Prairie Creek Reservoir campground in response to complaints that it has become a taxpayer-subsidized, semi-permanent trailer park nicknamed "Springerville" after the Jerry Springer television show. The ICLU sued Muncie Mayor Dan Canan in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis on Tuesday, four months after the ban took effect. "My only comment is that my decision was based on the advice of city attorney Charles 'Chic' Clark," Canan told The Star Press for a story today. "I would never make a decision like that without running it by the city attorney first." The ICLU brought the lawsuit on behalf of longtime camper Tommy Wallace, who says he is known as "the mayor" of the campground. Wallace, a native of Hazard, Ky., had displayed a Confederate flag that measures 3 feet by 5 feet from his trailer at the campground for more than a decade. "Mr. Wallace displays the flag as a symbol of his heritage inasmuch as he is from the Southern part of the United States," ICLU attorney Kenneth Falk wrote in the lawsuit. Falk said in the lawsuit that city officials threatened to evict Wallace if he did not remove the flag. The ban is a violation of the First Amendment, the lawsuit alleged. "It seems fairly clear that the city is attempting to do something it cannot do, which is restrict speech," Falk told The Star Press. The lawsuit asks U.S. District Court Judge Larry McKinney to stop the city from enforcing the ban and for it to pay ICLU attorney fees.   It's amazing what you can sue for when you have the government paying for it.  Maybe the ICLU will be more successful than it has been in the recent past.  From bar review, I believe the city/state will have to show that the ordinance serves a compelling state interest.   Oh, and I wonder if Dave Letterman will admit he comes from Springerville, Indiana?!

						   Ok.  So we're going to Vegas on a puff of air and a bag of stale Cheetos in the garage.   No, not really.  WE GET TO GO TO CELEBRATE MARRIED LIFE!! YEE-HAW!  We're so excited for you, Angie and Tommy.  They're the reason we get to go to Vegas.  Just say, Fuck our bills, here we come.  As for the Cheetos in the garage, that's our garage sale pile that we pray will bring our spending money!  There's some awfully weird stuff in there!  Maybe I'll win a year's salary on Keno.  Wouldn't that be the shit.   Anyway, so I have the wonderful and fun opportunity to work with the bride on getting together a bachelorette party in Vegas on a budget.  Being short on moo-lah and having lived what most call the boring married life for over a year now (goodness, they don't know what happiness they're missing!), I could use a little help.  This BLOG is open to suggestions!  Anyway, Ken and I secured plane tickets and hotel rooms yesterday, so we're excited.  I'm just so happy to (1) be going out of town; (2) going out of town and turning a blind eye to the bank account; (3) supporting our good friends in this fabulous time in their lives!  So, I get to take my mind off the job hunt for just a moment and think of all the fun we'll have in Vegas.  It's out west and not the mid-west.  It's so cool.  And Ken has never been on the western side of the Mississippi River.  Happy birthday honey.   Now, if only September can get here!  And don't forget the bachelorette party suggestions.  Come on now!

						   All you married and almost married couples out there.  You must check this out!  NEWLYWED GAME HOME ADDITION  Although it is lacking the liesure suit wearing Bob Eubanks, there is much fun to be had out of this box full of simple fun.  Four dry-erase boards, four pens and a book of questions!  The game in the box is pretty good, even if outdated as Mr. Eubanks hair-do.  Questions included that have the potential to incite the retaining of a divorce attorney include:  * Your mother-in-law is best illustrated by what animal? * The last thing your wife purchased that you hated was what?  Questions included that have the potential to bust the best of brains:  * What color are your bed sheets? * When was your first kiss? * What socks did your husband wear on your first date?  Questions that are just plain wierd:  *What color tie would your husband like to receive? *What product is advertised in your husband's favorite television commercial? *What possession would you give up if you had to?  The game is fun, interesting, and laugh inducing.  Enter into it light of heart and laugh much.  Also, I think next time we're going to write our own questions to spice it up!

						   So, I have been absent from the blog for awhile.  That is easily explained by two words that are the single most horrible experience of my entire life - BAR EXAM.  It's so horrible, I cannot speak of it hear for fear of offending the strong.   Some issues I must make up for: Happy birthday mom, July 25.  Happy birthday Ken, July 29.  Happy birthday Ralph (father-in-law), July 30.  I hope you all had wonderful and blessed days.  Ken, I know you were stuck in a car with me for 8 hours on a journey to the mountains of Tennessee.  (actually a really cool experience.  I'm 25 years old and had never seen the smokey mountains!)  Also, happy wedding day Katie and Nate (for whom we travelled 500 miles for).  Ken and I hope that you are as happy together as he and I are and that your marriage is full of blessings and love.   Happy Anniversary, Meg and Mike.  One year!  If you are like us, it doesn't seem like that long, yet it seems like we've been married forever.  Hope that you are more in love today than the day you got married and that you had a wonderful anniversary.   So, we're back at work, if only temporarily, and now harrowing in on the job hunt.  Ken got the job of his dreams, so now I'm out looking for mine.   Take care and I'll keep this up better now that "the monster" (as my mother-in-law puts it) is past me (at least for now.  Let's see if I pass!)
