       Well! Its been a few days since I have updated, sorry to all my die-hard yet apparently non-existant fans, but I have been a busy little beaver...   So like I said, on the weekend, I was shipped off to some friends of the family for the weekend, Gitte and Bent, they were both in their early fifties but they were sooo funny, and they have travelled like EVERYWHERE in the world!... ok not quite everywhere, but close enough...   So, I arrived there friday arvo and together the three of us cooked food, sat in the lounge room and drank wine while and spent half the night just talking togetgher which was very nice. Turns out that they both love Les Miserables, too, which was very nice. Which remindes me, I am still waiting for SOMEONE to send me over my copy... (hint hint mum) Anyway, just before we went off to bed, they gave mde a present to remember them by, a dressing gown thing made from real chinese silk with embroided dragons on it, it is soooo nice! They got it when they were in china..... obviously..... OH and I also went grocery shopping with them, and we bought fresh artichokes and ate them for entre which reminded me of our old artichoke plant back home. Which is now 'expired' as the three of us would put it.   So the next day we were up bright and early and on our way to Nyborg, a small harbour town on the island of Fyn. To get from Sjæland to Fyn we had to cross the longest hanging bridge in the world... well, it was ONCE the longest hanging bridge in the world. For about 2 months until the Japanese built a longer one...lol. Ayway, we were there because their son, Kenneth, is in the Navy and his ship was docked their for the weekend so we went to visit him. The boat was very cramped and kind of crappy, I dont know how he has managed living the past 4 months on it!... so we made Swedish pizza for lunch which was super dooper and then went for a walk around the town of Nyborg and looked in an old church... came back to the boat for coffee and biscuits. I ate the buiscuits but didn't dare touch the coffee, the machine looked as though it hadn't been cleaned in a long, long time!... and besides, I dont like coffee... Kenneth took photos of EVERYTHING using the phone camera which was funny. We all made fun of him for it.   So after our boating adventure, we took a car trip (minus Kenneth who had to watch the boat) so a place where Gitte og Bent could stock up on beer (and stock up on beer they did!) and we went to the biggest rock in Denmark, Damestenen (The Lady Rock)of a whopping 42 metres! Not quite as big as Ayres Rock, but well, Denmark is a very small country. Gitte and I had a photo shoot on the top of the rock :) If I ever find the pics I will find somewhere to post them so you can see them...   And second last on our little sightseeing adventure was a castle, I can't remember what it was called, but I do know that it had over 1,000 singular window panes (it said so on the brochure!) So we looked around the castle for a while, it was the nicest castle I have seen in denmark yet, but I have only seen 4. And yes folks, Katie is now part of history, having been to a real, danish castle toilet! I'm sure you all wanted to know that. So anyway...   Then we looked around the castle grounds, and they had a little museum thing with all these old antique cars, very nice indeed! Then Gitte and I needed to pee again so we went on a bold search for the museum toilets... which we didn't find. But what we did find was a secret hallway, called 'Draculas Mansion'... It was like this creepy, really dark hallway thing with crypts and spider webs and creepy organ music playing in the backbround. And at the front it had the story of the real dracula and how the dracula stories began, which was really interesting....   So there were Gitte and I, standing at the edge of Draculas Mansion, neither of us daring to go foreward... 'Shall we go in?' I asked Gitte, clinging to her arm... it was a very creepy hallway... 'Uh... I guess.' Gitte replied. We both took a tiny step foreward. .... .... We both looked at each other. 'uhhh... Lets wait for Bent..' We decided we needed a strong, male presence to protect us from dracula.   So we went back, collected Bent and walked into Draculas Mansion, both us old ladies clinging onto Bent like glue. It was so funny, Just as we were going in, we stopped for a few seconds. Gitte looked behind us and screamed, jumping five feet in the air... which made me scream and jump five feet in the air. This German tourist just suddenly appeared behind us, and because of the rain outside, had a hooded jacket on which in the shaddows looked sooo much like a cape! Lol, anyway, Gitte, Bent, the German tourist and I stod there and laughed for like 5 minutes because it was so funny... i guess you just had to be there!   After the museum, we walked through the gardens. The castle grounds had 4 mazes, although we didn't have enough time to go in any of them. I noticed one of them was made out of bamboo. I thought this rather pointless as you could pretty much see through the hedges... and wasn't that NOT the point of a maze. There was a small tree top walk, where we could walk on little hanging bridges 15 metres in the air, among the tree tops... although certainly not as big nor impressive as the one that was like 80 metres high in Australia, I thought it was still nice. After that we continued our way through the gardens... 'sampled' a strawberry or two from the strawberry patch, and a raw gooseberry... then exited the gardens. Because it was the castles 450th birthday, a single entry fee will automatically come with a year pass... Gitte spelt my name as 'Catie' rather than 'Katie'which I thought was rather cool.   So then on the way back, we stopped at this little resteraunt thing for dinner. Its a quiet little cottage in the middle of a forest, I liked it a lot! Anyway, it was a buffet kind of thing, help your self deal. And we sure helped ourselves! There was soooooooooo much food there, seriously I dont think I can write just how many different kinds of food! So, naturally we wanted to try everything there... and the good stuff we wanted to try twice... we had marinated steak, spare ribs, chicken kabads, curried lamb, baked mini potatoes, fried potato, potato salad, pasta salad... and the list goes on! So yeah, we were very very full indeed when we went back to the car, and I slept until Copenhagen. It was an early night that night, we had a big day! Lol!   The next day they said I could sleep in, they had no plans. Now, I'm not sure what they ment by 'sleep in' but when I got up at 11am, they were all like 'Woooow! Good Afternoon, Jonas!' (they have a joke with this guy they used to know called Jonas who slept all the time... so I became Jonas) It was funny, though. So that day I did not a lot, just sitting around and talking to Gitte and Bent, and then I scrubbed and peeled 50 million potatoes. Fun fun fun! Now, this is kinda strange for denmark, but Gitte and Bent have a little pit fire in their backyard and that night we cooked fresh salmon and potatoes in the fire, and as much as I dont like fish all that much, it was sooo good!   That night I went home with Marianne and Anne and Niels, normal life back at the host families!   Anyway gtg,   Update again another time!   Luv Catie/Katie/Jonas

      This weekend Marianne and Neils are going to a rotary weekend, and due to my temporary loss of host siblings, I'm being shipped off to a friend of the families for the weekend... I've met them once already and they are very sweet, I'm sure I'll have a nice time there. We're going to visit their son who is in the navy (I think) so we'll go down to the harbour and see all the boats which will be nice. So around 4.30 this arvo I'll be moving to another house, but only for 2 nights.   And at 1pm today Im going off to the airport, again, to say goodbye to yet another oldie, Angela. Which I'm sure will be very sad...   I got an email from my host-sister-to-be when I go back to Australia today, v. exciting, I can't wait! She's invited me to visit her and her family in Denmark so I will definately do that :)  I probably wont be on for the next three days, but I'll be sure to update when I get back!  Cheerio,  Katie

      So, yesterday was the summer solstice, or Mid-Summer as they like to call it here. The longest day of the year, where its tradition to go down to the beaches and light huge bonfires and (in the olden days only) burn witches!... but only one problem, there was a thunder storm. All through the day it rained and rained and rained and rained... and even at one point hailed... and just as it was hitting the bonfire lighting time, the rain all of a sudden stopped! And not a moment too soon! So we got our bonfire in the end, although it had to be started with petrol because the wood was wet and then the petrol made this really gross brown smoke stuff... but the point is, we had our bonfire, and we burnt some witches! (fake stuffed witches, but witches none the less) And then just as it was getting dark (around 11.30 pm) everyone was setting off fireworks, very pretty!     So we (me and Marianne and Niels, me hosties) came back to the house and ate freshly picked danish strawberries with vanilla ice cream and watched more fireworks on the tv from Århus... and at exactltly midnight the rain started again and then the power went out which was kinda cool... so that was my danish mid-summer   Toodles  Kaz

      Looks like I'm an only child for the moment... My sister Anne (16) has gone off to Jutland for the week with a friend from class, and my brother Christian (19) is touring Berlin with his band. So its been nice getting to know the new hosties better.   So... my host family have just finished booking the accomodation to Austria and the Czech Republic, where we are spending around 2 weeks in beautiful central europe! On monday night my host mum and I took a spur-of-the-moment bike trip to the local library to get some travel guides for Prague (they even got a Lonley Planet guide in English for me :D) and we spent the rest of that night reading over the guides together which was quite fun... I am sooooo pumped about our Summer Holiday!!!  Denmark played sweden in the football (soccer for all you non-europeans). If both teams got 2 goals, then Italy would be out of the compitition which is what all us scandinavians wanted... Denmark led for most of the match, but the final score was 2-2, perfect! Ciao Italiano! Next match Denmark plays is against Czech...  Aargh, I can't believe just how fast the past 6 months have gone... its so crazy, and they say that the last 6 months goes the fastest... so before you all know it I will be home again.  ...oh and by the way I think you can register as a member of my site here, so if you figure out how to do that, I would be much obliged!   Cheerio!  Kaz

      Hi everyone! Well, guess whos back from the dead? Ok, not the dead, but at least the 3-months-with-minimal-contact-to-australia phase I was going through... so I have found a solution, a blog (short for web-log) here I can post messages... or if I'm feeling too lazy to type then I can post audio messages so you can hear my beautiful voice again!   So... what has katie been up to in the past 3 months? Hmm... probably too much to write in one simple post, so I'll just skim over the highlights...  1. Euro tour, 18 days in a bus with 57 other exchange students going around europe... my fav. countries being austria and italy...  2. Survived a near death experience involving a faulty safety harness and a 20 story drop on a ride called the 'the golden tour' (or 'den guld tårn')... but yes I am alive and in one piece!  3. Moved host families, my new family are sooooo sweet :D   4. Met some of the coolest people in the world... one of whom is going home on saturday :'(  5. FINALLY got around to watching Pirates of the Carribean... very cool movie and I highly recommend it  6. Um... thats about it... I'm sure I've done lots of other cool stuff but I just can't think of it at the moment but when I think of all the other cool euopean things I've done I'll be sure to tell you...  OH and on the 4th of July I'm going back to Austria and the czech republic again with my hosties, w00t!  Anyway, gotta get a move on!  Love yas all, Kaz

       So, this little exchangeable is finaly back from  Austria and Prague with the hosties. Had an AWESOME time, twas lots of fun. So here is a quick scedule of what I did...  &nbsp;   Sunday, 4th July: We figured out the car trip to Austria would take around 14 hours... so logically we would leave at 7pm that night and arrive 10 the next morning. Yes, with 5 people in the car plus baggage and a whole night in the car, we were all looking foreward to the long drive ahead... need I point out my sarcasm? No, it really wasn't so bad really... of course, me being the ever impressive exchange student ended up stuck in the middle seat for most of the trip, but well, despite the fact I had next to no sleep and I was stuck in between Christian with the pointiest most triangular shoulders in the world and Anne who wouldn't know the words 'move-over-your-squashing-your-poor-little-exchange-student' if they came up and bit her in the nose!&nbsp;So after being sat on, poked by pointy shoulders,&nbsp;a long long time, I was rather looking foreward to the end of the journey. However, there&nbsp;was one highlight of the&nbsp;journey. Let me tell you, theres nothing like&nbsp;watching a German sunset at 4 am squashed into the back seat of a crouded car... unless of course you count sleeping, which is&nbsp;in fact what I was doing as the sun came up. I guess all that lack of sleep finally caught up on me! Which brings us to...   &nbsp;   Monday 5th July: After&nbsp;around 12 hours in the car, we stopped in at a truckstop for some 8am breakfast. We were all tired and grumpy&nbsp;but thaks to my 'Rotary Plastic Smile' I managed to come out of Breakfast without biting anyones heads off. So I atre some joghurt, bread with cheese&nbsp;and some with nutella and had a hot chocolat. There was a huge toy kanargoo in the corner. Over breakfast Christian enlightened me as to why Danish people dont like German people. I had known about this fued for a while, but I never knew where the arguemant had actually sprung from. 'Well,'&nbsp;explained Christian, 'Its because they're all big and fat and smell like sausage.' Hmm... yes very good explanatin indeed... but I guess its&nbsp;at about the same level as the why Aussies dont like New Zealanders or&nbsp;Tasmanians. And just to prove his point, the very next person to walk past our table was indeed, as Christian had said, a big fat German... and&nbsp;yes, he smelt like sausage, but then again he&nbsp;was the chef of the cafe there so I guess he had an excuse... So&nbsp;with wide, bright eyes and cheerful faces all round, we willingly&nbsp;squashed ourselves back into the car for the last leg of our journey... only 2 hours thank goodness!&nbsp;     &nbsp;   So we arrived in our little Austrian town, I can't remember the name of it but&nbsp;it was very close to Salzburg, where The Sound Of Music was filmed.&nbsp;We were to stay in a 3 storied apartment type thing with three floors,&nbsp;and we had booked the 2nd and 3rd floor of it, as another family (friends of Neils and Marienne) would also be joining us in austria. We arrived at 10 but we werent supposed to check into our rooms before 3. We couldn't find anyone who worked there around so we just waited and walked around for a bit.&nbsp;The apartment thing was on a&nbsp;farm thing. Also on the farm was a&nbsp;little herd of deer, some rabbits, some sheep and 2 goats (one of which bit me, lol). An hour later at 11am the family, (Henerik, Søren, Lars and Nies) arrived, along with the land lady of the place. So we unpacked, socialised, played table tennis (at which i lost badly) ate a BBQ for dinner and then caught up on some much needed sleep!  &nbsp;  Tuesday 6th July: When Niels and Marienn &nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   &nbsp;   To be continued, will get some food now&nbsp;cause I'm hungry)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       Ok... believe it or not... I have like no idea at all what I actually did on the Tuesday after the 3½ hour rotary meeting on Monday.... really no idea at all, which is really quite strange.. maybe I rang someone? No, I honestly have no idea... so lets just skip Tuesday and go to Wednesday...     Wednesday - Today I said my goodbye to my little Jill from Oregan, MISS YOU JILL! So got up bright and early at 11am and was at the airport by 12. However, did not come away empty handed - scored 2 bags of her hand-me-down clothes and some old hair products and that kind of stuff. Woohoo! Ok must of it was olf beyond use but it was free, and in an exchange students world, ...well, now ords can quite describe it. Of course it was sad when Jill had to leave, she is so cool and funny and I will miss her heaps but we will get our newbies soon, so that will be fun... that afternoon I went to see My host Mormor and Morfar (granparents on the monthers side) they are really nice, and speak a little bit of english too which is a plus!   Thursday - Ever had just one of those mornings? Ok this was one of those mornings! I had planned to visit the Danish girl who will be my host sister in Australia. The plan was, be in Slangelse by 2, have lunch and dinner there and meet her family. So, it takes around an hour by train to get to Slangelse, wasn't sure how long it would take to organise tickets and what not, so I set my alarm clock for 10, which would give me plenty of time to be there.   So my morning went like this... mum rang and woke me up at 8.15... and as much as i liked talking to her ai was so tired and really wanted to sleep... so i went back to sleep. When I woke up I looked at my watch... and almost had a heart attack! 11:59! Aargh! I had slept until 12! Ok, I did a quick figure of sums in my head... 2 hours... I had one hour traveling time, it would take me half an hour to get to contral station, 5 minutes to bike to the station... so poor me is left with 25 minutes to be up, dressed and showered! So going into superman mode, I sprung into action... Was ready in just under 25 minutes! Wow, new world record! So Jumping on my bike I pedaled as fast as I could to the station... that us, until I got a flat tire... so I ran with my bike as fast as I could the rest of the way (which wasn't too fast considering i had just woken up and i was lugging a bicycle!)I arrived at the station JUST as the train was leaving. This was just too typical! So I waited 20 minutes for the train... which turned into half an hour as the next train was delayed... so after getting off the central station, I rushed into the ticket office, ordered a ticket to Slagelse... and JUST missed my train there! By this stage I was ready to strangle anything and anyone that came near me... but no I fought down my anger and bought a hot dog since I hadn't had time for breakfast. The next train came in half an hour, and in the end I was only half an hour late which really wasn't too bad!   My afternoon - I was a little nervous about meeting Katrine, what if she were big fat and hairy? (sorry personal joke... i really have nothing against big fat hairy people)But no, she was really sweet. We discovered that we both love the same rock music and we both looove horse riding. We got on really well, I can't wait until she lives with me in Australia!   So we went shopping together for gifts for her mum, as it was her mums birthday. Our spoils of war were - some eyeliner, a pair of white pants, a cd and a shaver. We looked around the town of Slagelse for a while and were just on our way back when it started raining. But not just that little harmless rain... this was fig fat heavy drops of rain, and lots of it too! So arm in arm we sprinted to the public library and took shelter in there for a while and we had fun emailing people from her account, and I was going to show her some websited about shepparton but then the rain stopped so we continued on our way back home. We made it home and I met her sister (i had already met her mum at the station) and had dinner of chicken, salad and potatoes, very nice indeed! Then some of her mum's rellies came over so say a quick happy borthday and we ate cake and stuff...mmmm...danish birthday cake.... then Katrine and I sat on the couch together and I showed her some photos of the family in Australia which was nice, she's looking foreward to comming here.   Then we raided her room and figured out what clothes she would need to take to Australia... and with a 20kg limit on luggage we managed to sort out what she would need! Then Nicholas came home, the brasilian exchangeable staying with their family, came hoe from rome and the theree of us just sat around and talked until it was time for this little piggy to catch her train back home...   And it seemed by bad luck with the danish transport system was following me still... half an hour into our journey the train suddenly stopped in the middle of nowhere for like 20 minutes for aparently no reason... but all was well after that and I arrived home safe and happy and very looking much foreward to hosting our little danish student!

      So, the day after I got back from Gitte and Bents, the last monday in june, I gót up at 10 and patiently awaited for Claire, my cool danish friend from class who invited me to go to this kick-ass 5 day music festival on the island of Langelands. 2 other girls from Claires swim team would be comming too, so we arranged a little lunch so I could meet them. They were both very sweet girls, and only laughed when it was discovered that Claire and I had... well... 're-arranged' the pizzas we had bought for lunch. Ok... I know the simple rules of gravity say that when you hold a pizza on a right-angle degree, the topping will fall off, but we weren't exactly thinking about gravity when we needed ot figure out a way to transport the pizzas from the store to louise's house on bikes... anyway... it was kinda funny... :D  Anyway, the two girls, Julie and Louise were both really sweet. And Louise has this huge-ass oversized greyhound which is sooo soo cute!   So after that I went home and got ready for the Rotary meeting that night. 3½ hours of wholesome Rotary fun.... yeah as if! no, it really wasn't too bad, in fact, I actually kind of enjoyed it! I spent most of the meeting talking to an old Norwegian guy in Danish... which was funny because my danish is soooo bad. And then I spoke to the lady who was Emily (the last exchange student with the Tårnby Rotary Club) and she was soo nice and said she would invite me over to her house one weekend, which I am looking foreward to because she was cool.   Anyway, signing off for now  Captain Katie
