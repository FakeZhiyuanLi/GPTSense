      Well i guess I should have seen this one coming. Tara still is in love with ross, and I didnt want to believe it. *sigh* you think i would learn after so many heartbreaks, but this one hurts the most. I can see now that nobody really likes me from yc, and nobody really wants me there... Id quit if i could but kaitlyn would personally come here and castrate me if i did. I dont know what to do nemore. Staci and Ross are gonna be all over each other at yc, and staci even said shed have a makeout session with him at two in the morning. Believe it or not, i did have the same plan for tara and i. Shes gonna hurt once she finds out ross and staci are "friends with benefits." I dont know what to do. I was in love twenty minutes ago until i read taras blog and talked with staci on the phone. Its all adding up, but in a way i dont want it to. What am i supposed to do now? I guess this blog was made so i can write down the pain im feeling right now. The facts are boiling down to this more and more each minute. Tara loves ross still, and she always will. Ross hates me, and is gonna be an "item" with staci. Staci hates me as well, and is gonna be an item with ross. Therefore staci and tara will hate eachother and vie for the affections of the one they love. That leaves me where? Nowhere. Exactly. thats the problem im looking at. Hannah hates me, kaitlyn has no idea whats really going on, but now i dont know if i can do nething about it. I guess im a bad person. I will try to change has much as i can, but i can only do as much as they tell me that im doing wrong!! Im soooooo frusturated over here. Ive lost ross, one of my best friends, staci, another person who meant soo much to me, hannah, who i connected with, and tara, who i am in love with!!! ARGGGGG!!! I HATE MYSELF!! I KEEP FALLING IN THE SAME TRAP OVER AND OVER AGAIN!! why do i have to keep falling for girls?! I keep saying i wont love again, but then someone amazing walks into my life. Tara loves ross. thats the bottom line and that hurts more than nething! My heart is breaking, and i can feel it being ripped apart. I cant talk to tara for another two hours, and in that time i believe im gonna go mad. So this is all i have to say for my life. Im gonna wait to talk to tara and see what she thinks about all of this, and i hope im wrong. I really really reeeaaaalllllyyyyy hope i am sooo wrong on this. I just dont think i am tho. thats the part that hurts the most.                                                                                                     I love ya tara, no matter what                                                                                                                     Arik
