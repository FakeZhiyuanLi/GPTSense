      These two people have 1 thing in common,they are total posers who think they are very handsome and cool and farni. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT,IF U TWO ARE READING THIS,U MIGHT WANA GO TRASH OUR TAGBOARD,WHY NOT JUST FIND US AND GET THINGS STRAIGHT. Kristopher DEFINATION-->Whole day wear shirt wif collar .. put necklace inside the collar .. style hair like a piece of shit .. think damn mature damn cute (LET ME TELL U THIS,STOP TRYING TO ACT CUTE WIF UR STUPIT EARS) .. put braces must tell the whole green Earth .. whole day fake got drumset like his druming damn pro .. actualy can't even be compared to my grandmother's .. think soccer skills damn good .. be a goalkeeper only know how to screw up the whole team .. goalkick mus act cool .. take the ball must whack bottom part try to act like he is thinking where to throw the ball to .. actualy inside his brain is empty .. when he stop acting cool and decides where to throw the ball .. he will either pass to the enemy or kick out of the field .. still wan fake know how to play guitar .. to cut it short,he is a flirt who does not even look at his own fucking reflection .. so,if any girl who is liking him now reads this,please think twice maybe ten times about faling in love with the kristopher fu.   Maximilian DEFINATION--> height x waist lenght x weight About max -->Max .. if i were to rate ur looks upon 100 .. i rate u 0.5/100...well thats the highest i can go.. u n0e y? .. ur fat & ugly, fat & ugly and more fat & ugly .. no wait .............. UR FAT AND UGLY DAMNIT. If i knew that such a person existed in god's green earth when i was in my mum's womb, i wouldn't wanna be born into this world to have 2 breathe the same air as u. Max .. why like to wear ring and necklace .. think u maried liao arh .. u tink it's cool wearing them .. in actual fact u look like a poser wif a soon-to-be-choped-off finger.

      Bout a week ago,we(Nick,Sam,Shawn) and our fren NIGEL went to walk around at suntec city.We met @ the MRT station,and went to esplanade to check it out.After that,we went to marina square.We were all very tired,so we took a break @ MACDONALDS.We bought 3 cones and a nugget set.We found a spot near the corner at sat down to insult nigel HAHAHA. What luck we got,there was an old man,gues maybe around his 50's siting 2 tables frm us.After abt a few mins,he started to laugh to him self ''HAHAHA HEHEHEHEHEHE''.We were all shocked,thinking "WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WIF THAT OLD HAG?!" His expressions were kinda weird doh.Frm the side view it was as doh he was crying,but no tears,frm the front view,it looked as doh he was lufin his ass out @ sumtin.. We thought abt that man for awile,and thought to ourselves..Hmm.."Singapore retrench rate are getting higher",so we presumed that that poor old man had been retrenched..there were also evidence to our sayings,he was carying a black bag which looked like 1 that a biznes man use 2 cary..  TO PITY OR TO LAUGH? U DECIDE.

      there r some stuff in the wide wide wide world that realli realli annoys me..:  -People who are willing to get off their ass to search the entire room for the TV remote because they refuse to walk to the TV and change the channel manually.  -When a cop pulls you over and then asks if you know how fast you were going? You should know asshole, you frigging pulled me over.  -When people say "Life is short." What the hell?? Life is the longest damn thing anyone ever does!! What? Are they going to do something that's longer?  -When people ask "Can I BORROW a piece of paper?" Sure, but please don't return the favor! It's one god damn piece of paper!  -When something is "new and improved", which is it? If it's new, then there has never been anything before it. If it's an improvement, then there must have been something before it.

      On a sunny day,the birds chirping loudly,the sun shining brightly,the coconuts are riped,the bananas are yellow,the grass is green,the sky is blue,i got a new handphone,my grandma's birthday was yesterday night,i had a good dream of geting my new beautiful girlfren,i sliped in my kitchen,my mum gave me a scolding for breaking her lipstick,and gave me YAKOOT and lots of mentose. Later that afternoon,Nigel,Sam and Shawn the king of criticiser,spotted a cave in Nigel's backyard.Nigel,decided to check the cave out.They played sisccors paper stone,and Nigel won all of them.Sam didnt lose so much.So,Shawn went into the cave first,there was a skunk in it,and shawn ran out of it like a bird that runs.Next,Sam went into the cave.Sam,canot take the smel of the skunk,so,he too,ran out of the cave like a stupit horse wif a eagle head.Finally,Nigel peck,the warior who says he can endure the "smel", went into the cave.Moments later,Sam and Shawn saw a figure coming out of the cave,they took a closer look,and the figure apeared to be a skunk,WHAT HAPPENED TO NIGEL???

      Today,we went out.We met our jie,and went to orchard to shop.It was kinda borin going out wif her cuz its not intresting. LOL  After that,we met SHAWN,the KING of CRITICISING.We watched Harry Potter and Prisoner of Azkaban..   Meanwhile,in the cinema which was like a freezer,Nick sat beside a gal who looked like a duck.There were 3 girls who were around 18 yrs old and they were all very FAT.They made coments like "OFF THE DAMN TORCH LIGHT LEH!". LOL,STUPIT FAT TOADS.then shawn once in a while go n scream "ha..ha" LOL.When the show ended wich appeared to be nice to sam and boring to nick, shawn picked up sam's drinking straw,and shot it @ a mother's face.It flew like a missile before "THUD".The woman gave a stern look and muttered sum GOD KNOWS WAT SHE'S SAYING words. For our dinner,we had it @ LONG JOHN SILVER.We ordered 3 combo 1,and it tasted like shit.So,we ended up with sum left-overs - 2 pieces of chicken breasts.We took the breasts,went out to the openin outside Macdonalds @ the ground floor,aimed the breasts @ the window of Mac @ 2nd storey."PIAK!" the 1st breast hit the glas,meat was dispersed,wad a success!."TOK!" the 2nd breast mised the glas,it ended up lying on the floor on story 1 - Flattened,what a sad case it was.But after few minutes of thoughts,we picked up the meat wich was on the floor,and threw it real hard @ the signboard of LONG JOHN & MAC.WOW!I LOVE IT! Went our ways home and now im siting in front of the comp writing in thirsty HIPpO.
