      I have never been voted the top athelete, not that I deserved that. But yes I have been a little bit active in sports at parts of life. Here I am trying to try my hands at rock climbing at  urlLink Planet Granite , Belmont. The first time I tried rock climbing was at  urlLink runway 9  during one of my  urlLink college batch party . Both times I didn't set any records but had a gala time.

      I have tried many browsers till date, at least 20 of them. I started with Microsoft IE and at the end of the day I still use IE. There had been glimpses of other browsers trying to get ahead of IE but IE ruled all the time. Some of the good ones giving competition were Netscape, Opera, Konqueror. But none survived. Now I am playing around with  urlLink Firefox  and it is absolutely mind blowing. Some of the features like setting themes with ease and adding extensions are out of the world. One can literally choose which feature one wants and you add that extension. It is still in the early stages but if it gets stable (the biggest 'if' in free s/w), it has great prospects.

      SpaceShipOne was a success, though with some  urlLink glitches . But id does open up a lot of possibilities that always seemed just another 5 years away but never became reality. Difficult to tell how far are we from developing a commercially viable option for space travel. Things such as the SpaceShipOne encourages us, but not to forget the high  urlLink costs , that we had to pay sometimes.

      No I didn't go to Europe. I am talking about the movie  urlLink EuroTrip . It is one of the best funnies I have seen in a long time. There are two highlights of the movie, the first being the Europe tour (loved the east Europian part) and the second being the "Scotty doesn't know" song.      Attaching the lyrics:   Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me  Do it in my van every Sunday.  She tells him she's in church but she doesn't go  Still she's on her knees and Scotty doesn't know!   Oh Scotty doesn't know!  So Don't Tell Scotty!  Scotty doesn't know!  Scotty doesn't know!  So Don't Tell Scotty!   Fiona says she's out shopping,  But she's under me and I'm not stopping...   Because Scotty doesn't know!  Scotty doesn't know! (--X3--)  So don't tell Scooty!  Scotty doesn't know!   I can't believe he's so trusting,  While I'm right behind you thrusting.  Fiona's got him on the phone,  And she's trying not to moan.  It's a three-way call and he knows nothing!   Scotty doesn't know!(--X3--)  So don't tell Scotty!  Scotty doesn't know!(--X3--)   We'll put on a show!  Everyone will go!  Scotty doesn't know!  Scotty doesn't know!   Front of a parking lot?  Why not? It's so fun when you're on top!  It's full on in the snow  If it's a hunk(--?--) because Scotty doesn't know!   We did it on his birthday...   Scotty doesn't know!(--X4--)   Scotty doesn't know!  Scotty won't know!  Scotty doesn't know!  Scotty's gotta know!  Gotta tell Scotty!  Gotta tell him myself!  Scotty doesn't know! (--X10--)
