      I wrote this shortly after i lost my first love.  I must have really loved her, because her memory haunts me like a phantom to this day.  This poem holds true even after years have past.  My heart still aches.  No, i dont mean to say that I long to be with her again.  Only that something wasn't right about the way we parted, and i wish she were still in my life in some way.  Heartache  I feel Gentile warmth within my arms, I am the guardian, the protector of all that matters. Pain swiftly strikes inside like a flash of lightning. I fall on knee, strength fleeting, with no comfort, no refuge from the storm that seeks to devastate me. The lightning flash fades like the flash of a camera. A glimpse of what was, could have been, and what is, all in a moment. My cry is the only sound till I hear her words like a roll of thunder. I feel her familiar touch deep inside like a phantom from the past, yet genuine enough to be real. Then I know I am without.   This is one of my old poems. I published it about three years ago on poetry.com

      Its hot outside.  Something like 90 degrees without factoring in the humidity. I am going to go swimming and try to get a tan, or worse, burnt.   Is it a bad thing to have found someone you think you could spend te rest of your life with through the internet?  Call me old fashioned, but I feel that way.  I am already suffering from a geek complex and now this had to go and happen.    Her name is Aubree. Its a beautiful name. I met aubree while I lived in Cincinnatti, OH, so I tell anyone who asks, that we met while i was in Cincinnatti. Which is not a lie. What i do not mention is that Aubree has never been to Ohio and i have never been to Maine.  I met her while playing a MMORPG called Starwars Galaxies.  The only thing that could possibly be worse than telling people that i played an online game is telling people that I met my girlfriend online. I refer to my previous post about where i grew up and currently live.  Basically I feel ashamed by the nature in which we met and for the fact that i cannot openly embrace how we met.  All of that aside I do embrace us.  What is special about her, is the fact that I knew i liked her before i knew what she looked like. you dont get that in real life.  However, I later found out that she is beautiful which is a major bonus.  She plays video games, and shes somewhat of a closet slacker, like me. She is a "girly-girl" which i love about her. She is loving, caring, and understanding.  We are friends first and foremost.  One major thing is that if we didnt work out I believe she would still be there for me. That is probably the most important thing to me.    Aubree will be visiting in 15 days.  I bought her a plane ticket a couple of weeks ago so she could spend her two weeks vacation here with me.  She is very excited, and so am I.  I find myself counting the days.  You would think that I would be nervious but i am not.  As a matter of fact I think she is nervious enough for the both of us.  She says that she is afraid i wont like her when i meet her. people carry themselves differently in person.  I think it sounds absurd.  at leaset it wouldnt change my mind about how i feel about her.  I find myself kidding around about silly things like "If your feet stink. I'm sorry thats a deal breaker" The fact is she already has me and she just needs to be herself... minus the stinky feet, because thats a deal breaker.

      Welcome to my first blog.    My name is Jim Booth, at least thats what i prefer.  Depending on who you speak with I am known By other variations.  I seem to have collected many monikers over the years.  My given name, or the name i often heard my mother yell out of frustration, is James William Booth.  named for both my grandfathers. My Dads side of the family seems to like Jimmy-Bill which refers to my middle name William. No one uses that now, dont know why they ever started to.  In High shcool i was known as Jimmy.  since then i have grown up and tried some rough labor jobs.  Not wanting to get my ass kicked i decided that "Jim" would draw a little more respect from the crowd. Depending on what name I hear, I immediately know from where this person knows me     I suppose the words modest or meager describe me best. I am 26. I have long since given up my aspiration for total world domination and settled for controll over my own life.  Which at times seems just as difficult.  I live in a small town in Southern Indiana.  Its a very beatiful place.  Most everyone you would meet here are nice and friendly folk, save for a few rednecks. I have never really felt I quite fit in here.  There arent too many people around this area with my interests, and its easy to feel like a nerd around people who dont know how to turn on a computer much less surf the internet. Having read a study that most young men my age are spending more and more time in doors at the computer, i feel that i dont disappoint. when i am not at work, thats where you will find me, or on the couch.  My other intrests include watching movies and listening to National Public Radio. I guess im a slacker. Oh, and i haven't voted in over 4 years. How do you like me now? I work for a Wireless ISP in the closest town to me. which services about 300 or so busnesses and residents. I guess its my niche. Overall I am happy with my job.  It still feels new to me, having only been there for a few months, but i know i dont want to be anywhere else.    I have loved and lost, I am special, just like everyone else. I was almost married once about 3 years ago. I shiver to this day when i think about it.  Since then i have sworn off any type of serious relationship. I see myself married and happy, but i dont want children.  Kind of limits my options.  I am looking or the kind of relationship I can invent.  Friends with benefits seems to closely resemble it.  I guess i dont want to feel a slave to tradition or to someone else. Dont get me wrong I am totally monogamous.  It's just that i want to be me, not married, or a Mr..    Im not much for keeping a diary or expressing myself for that matter, but as I grow older, I have found myself trying new things to occupy my time.  Lately I have felt the need to express who I am, and what I think, even if no one is listening.  I look at it this way.  Chances are no one, at least no one I know, will ever see this, so its like throwing my emotions and thoughts into the void.  I Guess its a release. Anyway, It's a start.
