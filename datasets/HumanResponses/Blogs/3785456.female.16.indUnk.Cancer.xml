      Sittin here bored outta my mind, I cant sleep and there is no one on the internet. Talkin to brett on the phone but him and AEmodel over there actin crazy!!! (lol) **YUM** lol Dang i gotta call stephen and tell him sumthin.** I wont say it on here, but i text messaged him earlier.** This is crazy, you know im takign this brett being in bham alot harder than i thought, I man of course i trust him and all but i dunno, its wierd, I guess i jus miss him alot, but thing is i dont need to miss him this much, ITs makin me insane!!! I dunno mayeb its the stress gettin ready to take my drivers test. After i get it over with i think i will feel alot better. I dunno how well me and BG will make after high school. I mean i love him alot but this bein apart thing aint workin too well for me. And Its only liek 3 days, i would hat eto see 4 years!! And i mean i either have to go to auburn or amforn for pharmacy and his mom thinks that too far, and i mean i would do anything for brett but i cant just totally pick a job i will hate jus so i can go to a diff college. I mean i really wanna do pharmacy, i have been thinking about this sinve 7th grade and i have thoguht long and hard about what i wanna be, and i finnaly dicide and everyone in the world has a prob with it, well exept my dad, he loves the idea, i dont think he knows the expence it will cost to put me through college tho, i mean i will try as hard as i can to get a scholarship but you never know, and then if i dont, what then. Its crazy, you know its times like these I really miss brittany, i mean yeah i have frinds that i can talk to but i mean she was the one i told EVERYTHING too, and well now its kinda brett but he is so busy with his own life somtimes he just dont have tim eot listen, and i dont hold that against him, i totally understand but thi sjust  really makes me miss brit, its like we shared the same brain, althoguh it think i got the short end of the deal(lol) I know im dumb! oh well! HA well alot of ppl have helped me get through all this and one of them big time is ASH. I love ya to death ash thanks for being there!! anyways well to continue everyhting is really hard right now, and i have a feeling its not getting any easier anytime soon, when school starts back i will really have to work hard for my grades, and now if i pass my drivers test i will be driving, talk about a whole ohter stress block! Everytime i get behind that wheel brit will cross my mind, i mean it happened to her it can happen to anyone, and that scarres me, not just for myself but for my family and friends, i seen and felt that pain and i wouldnt want to put neone through that. But i will be carfull and i guess all you can do is put your faith in God. I really need to go see brits sis and mom, its been a while an di gotta take her that necklace. I dunno i guess i will do that tomorrow or sumthin. You know somthing thats kool that me and brett we seem so perfect for each other and that is soo awsome. It kinda scarres me to think that we wouldnt be together, I really love him, which i have sai dthat about ppl b4 but it didnt work out, and i have never felt this happy in a realtionship b4, so i dunno maybe it really is meant to be and will work out, i mean heck we went to preschool together and out of the "huge" population os section and sborro we met again. coinsadence, i dunno, but its kool! or atleast i think so. I will never forget when the first time i met him for the third time, lol confusing i know, a long story, but anyways i felt sothing i have never felt b4, i mean its just liek we connected, alothough he didnt come talk to me other than "hand this coke to my mom".. lol( i will never forget that!!) but i guess not tlking to me in preschool and in highschool, same same, lol but its jus all worked out and i love him mom and dad to death, they are so nice, i admit i was a little intimidated of him dad at first, i mean he IS a judge, who wouldnt be, but he is really kool, i like him alot. And i dont see what everyone has against clayton, i mean he is pretty kool to me, but i guess i didnt know him in highschool, but seriosely ppl should hold how a person was in the past against them, its not like he was a drugie! i mean ppl need to chill out around here, i swear they could turn this place into braodway with all the drama that goes on around here, but i guess that what ppl have to do to keep the bordom from taking over. We need a mall or sumthin around here, lol, but then i would never have money! lol but oh well, i cant wait till wed. ME and ash are goin to the mall again, itll be fun. but u have to get back so i can meet brett when he gets back from team camp. Fun fun ... right?! yeah i guess... i dunno but im shure i will be really glad to see him, i guess righ tnow im just trying to deal with me not getting to tlk to him, you know he isnt as whipped as everyone makes him out to be, i eman he acts like it, but seriously when it comes down to it he isnt, and it kinda bugs me when he says he is SOO much to everyone, i mean he is sute an dnice ans sweet and all the slice of cheese there but it makes me sound like a controll freak when he does that"jump" how high" stuff, i mean i dont want him to be THAT whipped! lol but i dunno it could just be a sborro thing, we dont get whipped out here at section, most of out guys are just players or potheads...speaking of players, hummm, no i wont go there, not tonight anyways. You know its not like neone will read this but it really does ease your mond sittin down and typin out all thes feelings and stuff. But it is getting late and i do need to get in the bed. Good night.

I have to good so "some ppls" parents will let them ride wit me. But everyone says its easy! But you gotta think who your talkin to when you say that... Im probally about as nervous as Ashley Black. Probally reason i cant say but it has sumthin to do with the guy on the AE bag!! YUM as she would say,(lol) I love her to death. I dont really know how these things work. I guess i just type abunch a stuff thats goin on then let everybody read it. Sounds like an invasion of privacy to me, but hey, who knoes it could grow on me.

      Hey hey sorry I missed last nights entry, I was kind on the phone with my bf! Whom I love so very much, well anyways, I went to themovies with Jess & Ash last night and watched spider man 2!! It was great, I mean I thought the first one was good but man this one was awesome!! You got to see it! Anyways then we went and ate at wingstop which was good too. Well guess what happens tonight!!!! Ash gets to meet AE model guy, and if all goes well I can release him name, but until then;)* if you know what I mean* anyways, Wish her luck on tonight!!! Ill blog in sometime and talk bout it. Well now you know why the name of this block is exited, but I guess your w/d why I have dazed, bc that completely how IM feeling, everything has been going extremely well for me(knock on wood) but Its kinda like dazed and confused but IM not confused at all, everything is really coming into a clear daze. Its like I've became the luckiest person in the world. And Why exactly I don't know. I don't know why anyone would want to bless me with all the great things that have came into my life recently. Its not like I deserve any of it!!! Any of it what so ever.Esspecially this great guy that has came into my life in the last few months, I mean its been the best relationship  have ever had and I have never been so happy with a guy, even if we were having a good day w/out fights, its never felt this great. I mean I just get this feeling inside me that is unexplainable, and what makes it 100 times better is that this special someone feels the same way, and I pray every day and night that it stays like that always. I love Brett very much and I hope he never forgets it, and tho sometimes I don't show it as much as I need to, I really do with all my heart, and I always will. Even if we don't end up together, although I think we might, but IF we don't I will always hold this love inside of me and it will be for Brett. Its kinda like in spiderman where she loves him and he loves her and although he thinks they cant be together bc of who he is, they end up running in to each other an dyou can see by the way they look at one another that they love each other and they feel that passion anf feeling inside. And it will always be there wether they are togehter or not, but anyways, back to Brett, i have that feeling with him and i do love him and i ALWAYS will wether we are togther or not, but i hope with everything i have that we can make it. I guess its just like reading book and you gotta keep going to find out how it will end.

      you know what im sittin here in the baseball sweater and talkin to ash and brett and all my ppl jus as any ordainary night but tonight its different, its all PERFECT. The right song is on the radio and just sittin here with nothing going wrong and i jus realize how LUCKY i am. I have gotten so use to my sugarpie being so sweet to me i started to take advantage of it. which is somthing i promised never to do. What a great girlfriend i am huh, but yet he still thinks i am the best thing in the world. And that made me realize what a bad gf i have been being. I should be thanking my lucky starts every second for what a wonderfull person that has came into my life to stay. And i hope its always like that. He makes me so happy and everything about him is great he is sweet and funny and puts other b4 him and icould go on and on and on, and couldnt think of a singe thing i dont need to be thankful for, so i need to open my big green eyes and take a look at what i have got and star actin showin him that he means the world to me and always will. I dont really have much to say tonight besides that . Not much happen today. We didnt get out test mach and i didnt go ne where today, Oh thanks ASH for cookin me breakfast, i had a blast at her house last night. You know i have made more friends in the last 4 months than i have in the past two years altogether, that has to say alot about brett. I have always thought of myself as a friendly person (when im in a good mood) andi have jus never really had the chance to show it, thats another story and i wont get into that. But im just so happy and thanksful for what a great boyfriend i have an di need to start acting like it. HE is the greatest in the world and i dont know what i would ever do if i lost him.I mean i would change my college plans to satisfy his mom, i would change my wardrobe to satisfy his parents with my appereance. I would learn to make banana nut bread even tho i hate it just so he would know that i love him, I would stay at a pisgah game jus to see him even tho he didnt come and talk to me, although he finnaly got around to it.(THANKFULLY) but latley i havent been acting like he means the world to me and he does more than ever!!! and always will. He is the best and not bc ppl think that he has alot of money and not bc his dad is a judge and not bc he buiys me things or pays for my food. Just bc he is brett, bc he is sweet and caring and treats me with repect and with more love than anyone could ever imagine, bc he makes me happy when i see his cute little smile, bc the butterflies i get evertime i have to tlk to his dad although it has gotten better bc is dad craks me up all the time. (lol) bc we can talk on the phone for hours and love every minute of it. BC we have a million things in common and we get along GREAT. This is why I love him, and i truley dont think that will EVER change. If i have ever believed in somehting being meant to be, this would be it, and i hope it stays like that for ever and ever. And i will make an effort to start acting  like thats the way i want it. BC it really IS! well thats all for tonight i think i will go call him now and tell him how much i LOVE him. and how lucky i am and Well i think you have the idea. bye bye now.
