      See this picture...u see nothing right?  urlLink    That's because there was a BLACKOUT. Yep, an 'almost' nationwide blackout. At first I thought it was just our apartment that had the black out....when I went out, I saw the whole flat nearby blacked out too. There was a mad rush for candles and torchlight in the house and we used a small transistor radio to listen to the news. Anyway, I had to fan my wife and Ilhan for almost two hours..luckily, my wife had this small battery operated fan to keep Ilhan cool... mummy with Ilhan and small battery operated fan  urlLink

      On the 26th of July, we finally brought Ilhan home. It seems that they doctor wanted us to keep Ilhan for one more day, so that we would not need to sign the AOR form, which would mean that whatever happens to the baby when we bought him home, the hospital would not be responsible. What puzzled me was that I dun get what difference one day would make, and I made that clear to the doctor. Anyway, I signed the form and brought him home. Another thing that irked me was that Ilhan did not need to be placed under 'that blue light' , like most jaundiced baby, and this was highlighted in his health booklet. And I was under the impression he was.

      My wife went home from KK hospital last Sunday. However, Ilhan is still in hospital as he is medically proven to be G6PD deficient and has to be under observation. He'll only be allowed to be taken back in two weeks time...

      I hate losing. I hate losing soo much I wish that word does not exist. But in life, you cant win all the time. This is something I have been telling myself, but I just cant accept failure. Failure means ( to me at least) that I did not try hard enough, and let everyone down. My friends have been saying that I am always hard on myself. Too hard&nbsp;,that I always blame myself instead of the people around me. Yeah, we lost again yesterday. 3 - 5. Hard to believe that we were leading 2-1 at one stage, and after I was taken out, they scored two. Everyone's saying how much difference it made if i was still on the court but I told them that I would be too tired to make any. Yesterday,&nbsp;I played like a madman. I did not tire so much. Even if I did, I told myself that I can still go on. It worked. My heart carried me , even though my body can't. Thats why Im more disappointed that we lost. How is it that you tried everything, pushed yourself to the limits and still fail?  That is when I looked around and start to question .... are my teammates trying just as hard? This is my weakness. When you play 120%, you expect the rest to do the same. But they dont. (Thats what i think). And when that happens, I get&nbsp;frustrated at them for not trying hard enough.  When you get down, you stand up and play on, no complains. When you injure yourself, rest a while and come back in when you are ok. That is not how my team mates play. They complain when they get down, they scream and say ' I quit' when they get the slightest muscle pull. Like I said, this seems to be my problem. In my working life it is also the same. I dont understand why people cant do it when I can. They dont try hard enough. They dont think hard enough. Instead of thinking, they give up and start to sigh. Like I always said, why waste time sighing, and sulking, when you should be using the time to think of a solution or a workaround? Anyway, I think i played better cause I had Ilhan in my thoughts. How much he would like to see me win the match, and he made me play harder, with the winning desire still burning in me. I did not tire that much....but it could be because of the $2.30 gatorade i bought. Go figure.

      Hey yo  Didnt go to work today as I had to send Ilhan to the polyclinic for his second dose of HepB injections. The funny thing is that when the nurse injected him, he screamed out and started crying. His screaming even alerted the other nurse on duty. "Wah !" she said.   After the polyclinic visit, we went to CompassPoint to shop for some things, with Ilhan in his stroller. Talking bout the stroller, I think it is a bit too small for him. His feet has already reached the end of the seat. Time to get him a new one....bigger one.   i'll be leaving later to play street soccer for my division. Did I tell you that we lost 6-1 last thursday againts some weenies? We just dun have the stamina and teamplay to compete with them. And today we will be facing AVS2, who won 10-4 on the first day? .... Did i hear you laughing? Why? You think we cant win? Let me prove you wrong, brother...

      Yesterday, my family came over to visit us and see Ilhan, and guess what, Ilhan slept through it. Every kiss or cajouling does not wake him up, he just sleeps. I realised that he  always   sleeps when ppl come over to visit. Saw Nabila and she has gotten bigger and heavier. She just celebrated her 1st birthday on the 15th of July.  Oh yeah, today Ilhan is 1 month old. I felt like it was only yesterday when I was in the labour ward with Seri.   BTW, I just came back to watch soccer at the Hougang Stadium. Went there after half time so that I could go in free. Anyway, had to wait till 15 mins before full time b4 they could let us in. The match is showcasing the Young Lions and  Sinchi Golden Throat TV FC.  Golden Throat...what a godamn funny name. I was already wondering why they had a Sinchi  TV  ( I dont recall any channels called Sinchi Channel) and now they have a Golden Throat in between them. What would they think next ? How bout Sinchi  Brazen Balls  TV FC? Anyway, Golden Throat is actually one of their sponsors (saw a poster of this Golden Throat lozenges with Ronaldo in it). But it is a funny name....Golden Throat.  For the record, Sinchi beat Young Lions 1-0. I went to watch the match mainly to watch Young Lions play. And Im quite impressed by Baikaki Khaizan. The way he plays reminds of Rio Ferdinand. A ball-player defender. Also quite liked his partner, Precious. However, they dont seem to have a good striker, especially Fadzu ( who miss an open goal from 5 yards out).  My Ilhan can score from there.  While watching the match, I wondered if Ilhan will grow up to be a good soccer player. Maybe he can be as good as Fandi Ahmad. That would definately make me proud...seeing him stepping on the field in the Singapore jersey

      Sorry for not blogging for the whole week. Truth is I was feeling depressed ... after seeing Portugal lose to Greece.Let me repeat that again...Portugal lost to Greece. Greece? Greece? BLOODY GREECE? I can accept it if they lost to France or any other team but Greece?   Ilhan seems to be growing, broader by the day. He seems to have put on quite some weight and I would feel tired just carrying him for 20 mins. We have just switched his milk formula to S-26 Gold, from Enfalac, cause he seems to be vomiting more often these days. Hopefully the milk switch would stop the vomiting.  Yesterday, after class, I sat at the tail end of the NEL MRT Train. And as the train started to move, I realised that they do not switch on the lights in the tunnels anymore. Everything is pitch dark and you get to see the train station slowly getting smaller and eventually dissapear. And something came up in my mind. Life is like train stations. For every part of your journey in the train,you get to see ppl getting on the train. In life, you get to know people and they stay with you, until it is time for them to go (not as in death but because they resigned etc)  but your life has to go on. In trains, people alight when they reach their destinations but you stay cause you have not reached your destination yet. And when the train moves, you see the last train station getting smaller..and smaller until they disappear.Its like you remember them vividly but as time pass on, you will slowly forget that they existed. But you anticipate the next train station, and the cycle starts again...  So when do you alight? At this point, it reminds me of interchanges. There will be a time where you have make difficult choices and when you do, there is no turning back to go the other way.For me , I have made my choice and I am on my train going where it would take me, my wife and Ilhan. For Ilhan, his trip has just begun...and at every train station, I will be there for him.

       urlLink Life Starts Here  Well, Im feeling more sleepy lately, cause Ilhan has this knack of waking up at 1, 3  and 5 in the morning. And I have gone to work the last few days looking like a zombie ( my wife said I look like a round squirrel....ah well). He'll be waking me again at 3 this morning..but it doesnt matter..cause I get to see the Euro final..PORTUGAL! PORTUGAL! ( No, I did not bet..)

      Its been like eons since my last update. Truth is ... I have been saving up my thoughts a lot...and Im unleashing them in this update. Hold on to your seats!! (maybe I am just being lazy...)  The GOOD 1) Soccer. My team finished fifth. After that last defeat, we had no hope of making the final four, so in the last match of the group, I exploded. I scored a hat-trick to be precise. Everyone was shocked at how I could transform from a unfit, fat soccer player to a Hattrick hero within a week. Truth is, the match was played at half-pace, as both team were already out. Some of my players in my team didnt want to play an non-consequential match, and I blasted them for 'not having the fire in their belly'. With them gone, I took over. The first goal was a long shot from the centre line. The second, a screamer. From way before the half way line, I unleashed a low powerful shot that took their keeper by surprise. It was an amazing goal. The third was also a beauty. I played a 1-2 with Kevin (the burmese guy) and placed the ball beyond the keeper.  We were 5-0 at half time and eventually won 5-2 as we started to lift the foot off the pedal in the second half. On the fifth-Sixth place match, I scored another two. The match was intense, and we were 2-0 down in 3 mins. What I dont like is them kicking my leg , elbowing my head and pulling my shirt. Was very close to punching one of them. damn....its like as though they are playing for 1st place. 2) Ilhan...DEFINATELY He has lost his hair...shaved it off. He looks cute, so i call him bul, short form for 'Bulat' (means round in malay). He has started to make those 'ooh,aah,gaga' sounds that babies make. He also smiles everytime he sees my face. Hmmm....I wanna go home and see him now. 3) Mummy...DEFINATELY mummy celebrated her 26th b'day on the 24th. Have not bought her anything yet, dunno what she wants (HP or diamond ring). She is complaining that she has gone fat again....  The BAD I've noticed something on the bus this morning. There was this gal with her cute Samsung Hp with her OWN picture on it. One thing I dont understand is ...are these ppl so full of themselves ? It is understandable if you put pics of your loved ones (at least u know what you are working for and to give you motivation to get home safely) but I dont understand if you put a pic of yourself on your phone . Have you not seen enough of yourself in the mirror everyday? Are you soo self centered that when you whip out your phone, you expect to see yourself every single time? Damn......  The Ugly Have you been to AMK MRT Station every morning? I do, and everyday I see women running after trains. Emphasize is on women, cause only women run whenever they step into the mrt station, like as though they are walking on hot coal. They will start to scamper when they realise that the train is arriving in 1 min. What the dont know is that by the time they run up, they train would already have been full and is about to leave. Why cant they just wait for the next train? And get this...the next train will arrive in 1 min. 1 min...Cant they just wait for another 1 min? Its not as though the train will arrive in intervals of 5 mins ( in the morning, trains arrive every minute).  I just dont understand these ppl, and if have been shoved aside by them, you would understand why Im seething about this.  Will post some pics from Ilhan's 'cukur rambut' ceremony.....
