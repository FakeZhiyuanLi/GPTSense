      The semester is drawing to a  urlLink close . but the nostalgia that is supposed to seep into one's conscience isnt ! (you know how  urlLink  graduation/commencement ...and 6 yrs of college....and the last vestiges of a carefree & responsibility free life are supposed to make you more sensitive to all the freedom that you have currently)  I guess I am not gifted with any foresight to really appreciate all that I have now..eh! Can barely think beyond the next final exam (2 of them back to back..without a minute in between!...sad! ..) Maybe one of these days I will try making a list of things that I THINK i am gonna miss and also a converse list (just for posterity).....And will compare that list ....say....5 years down the line ??   Naah...Its too much work.....Will think about it some other day

      I have a new discovery.   To be succesful or popular or to just plain "fit-in" in your work place (cubicle anyone...!) you need to be conversant in atleast a couple of Cartoon characters. Calvin & Hobbes or Dilbert are ideal choices. One of these is a must. Else you are just a tyro. That means the metamorphosis from a boy to a man actually requires a revision of the first principles :-). Ofcourse this is a direct consequence of observing my friends on the other side of the fence...Me, hey I am still a kid ...I guess there is still some more time to go before that C&H forward from the office mailing list is the high point of the day :-)  Now why did some one say the child is the Father of Man!

      Read  urlLink this  article on CNN. It supposedly tries to list the 50 worst songs of all time. eerily, I had heard quite a few of them, heck I distinctly remember a few of them being quite popular back home in India. Whoever said good music is universal !   urlLink Orkut  is a bloody waste of time! sincerely !

      Its been some time ! Had a hectic week..  Made a trip to the silicon valley ...job hunting mode Planned a trip to the Grand Canyon, AZ....did not materialize   Its the long weekend here..and you are really not american enough if you dont vacation on a long weekend :-)  I have more pressing matters on my head...  Read  urlLink this  cool article on NYT on blogging...hmm..although it does not cover the kind of blogging i do.... Thinking on those lines....I guess this page is not an intimate diary..although I have hardly included anything "non-me" in this...as in...no critiques of existing news events, no predictions on anything of interest...maybe just a few lines of offbeat news...?? hmmmm... Maybe I should take up a topic for a week..and blog on it...Now what is a suitable topic??  ......  Haah..screw it,,maybe some other day !

      Ah...the art of Saying No There are fewer things in life that require more finesse. Ofcourse it helps if you have a "dont care a rat's ass" personality. Otherwise its really a mean job to say No.  How many of us out here are a prisoner of our own image ? Its something beyond just peer pressure, or just complying with one's own moral police. Haah...screw it,..we all know what i mean...will write about better things maybe  A friend of mine got engaged..Cannot think about him settling down..Hah ..hes just 23!!!! Anyways...Heres to you dude! Enjoy Life...  PS: just a reminder..If anything dosent make sense..just look up at the title! thats my disclaimer...and i have absolutely no obligation to be sensible....!!!!

      Did I ever mention before...."however bad a situation is...it can ALWAYS get worse" Never credit your inventiveness/creativity to come up with any scenario as diabolical or miserable as the one that life conjurs up all by itself..(and absolutely seamlessly...mind you!)  What a pessimistic line of thought..Yeah I guess..but wait a minute..it can always get worse.. I am reminded of one of those strikingly irreverent quotes by  urlLink Ayn "Know-All" Rand . Too bored to look up the exact words..but basically she says something on the lines of:  " If you feel that the normal emotion of the mind is that of failure...and success is something that is fleeting..then you are all wrong in the head and probably dont deserve to be a human, you probably should have been born as some lowly creature that crawls on the wall!"  How peculiarly inspiring ! On the other side of the spectrum who was it who said "Sorrow is the most fertile ingredient for creativity...and Sorrow that derives from failure is second only to unrequited love".  As much as I hate to admit it..why does the second observation always seems to hold true!....  But like I said, it can always get worse, so maybe I should just look for joy in whatever I have now..and always think about the Law of Averages whenever I am down :-)

      This is the last week at work. Today's possibly the last day..Hmm maybe i should take a few snaps too..well whatever..Am also planning to go to the Grand Canyon sometime in the near future....maybe next week???  On completely another note. Was lazily browsing the net reading up on General Relativity. Came across a few sites on Einstein and Feynman. Feynman is refreshingly original..each of his speeches, his perspectives, his approach to a problem..I also read a talk given by him on  urlLink "What is Science" ..liked it. Really different perspective :-)  hmm..i think I should make this a regular habit....Physics is fun...and Physicists are interesting ppl!...Haven't felt so in a long time...!  A metaphor comes to mind, You can appreciate the summit only if you are below it :-) have I reached the peak of my academic capability and am I on my way down now ???:-( I have an unnerving sense of deja vu when it comes to matters of theoretical physics..the same feeling I had when I was much younger (and was waiting to accumulate the mathematical tools to reap the harvest of my inquisitiveness..alas it never came, I guess!).So now I am on the other side and quite possibly going downhill... But the lack of knowledge increases the mystery and makes it more attractive to look back on those days...  Did any of this make sense..I seriously doubt it..but i prefer it this way...something to laugh at ...someday :-)

      Kartik was here last weekend.  What do you do when a friend comes over and you happen to stay in L.A. ? Roamed around town, Santa Monica, Hollywood etc. etc. Surprisingly I wasnt really bored. Watched TROY at the Chinese Theater on Hollywood Ave. Definitely not worth the 11 bucks :-(  Rode the Metro a Lot...I mean a LOT! shows you the sleazy underbelly of this city. From the mansions of Malibu to the dark alleys of Downtown...the kind of people you see on the metro(mostly) can be fit into a few stereotypes (Unlike the subway in NYC).... But the people on the bus are colorful in their own small way. Most of them are normal (economically challenged ???) ppl, but of the remainder, a few of them strike you as obsessive, compulsive people, a few of them, irreverent and you wanna be afraid, a lot of them are just plain amusing, quite a few of them are what you would call deranged...but there is also a small minority whom you cannot really place. (did that sentence make sense...screw it!)  Met a very intersting person. Initially I thought the dude was just plain mad. He made refernces to a conspiracy regarding the 911 attacks. said the military had planned and executed it..i was bored already. Then he started off saying that the pepper spray can he had, contained sarin instead of pepper..."this wont hurt you son, it will just ........KILLL you!" I was mildly amused. I guess I inadverdently showed interest, and this spurred him on to make wilder claims. Said an armageddon is approaching, the intesity of the solar flares (11 year cycles) has been increasing in intesity in the last few stages....it had increased beyond such measure that a magnetic dipole inversion is expected anytime now! whoa...I thought these things took a lot more time than a few years...anyways..he went on talking a lot of half baked scientific stuff...Said he was on the run with a new identity, new face...new body.. and what not..I forget most of what he said...Also said a few things about inventing a new fuel...a new laser system and a whole lot of other stuff..said he was a scientist...he had the vocabulary to support his claims but little else!  Turned out to be a memorable trip in the end...free show...me and kartik were laughing long after :-)

      A happening day today. Went for the graduation ceremony....Presidents address and Sen. John McCain's address...then followed by the valedictorian's speech ...hey he is an Indian American Mallu :-) Was my first time at an event of this type.So I wasnt typically bored..although a lot people in the assembly were :-)...Finished the event..Took a lot of snaps, broke for lunch..at The Grinder. Fun chatting with an insider (at Intel) Back to school again for the actual conferral of degrees...felt good about myself inspite of the huuuge(!) amount of people graduating with me..Took a lo-ooot of snaps again...  Officially an Alumnus now ....  Came back home. Went to downtown to pick up Kartik..Was late as usual :-)...and also walked a lot in Downtown hunting for the correct return stop...(dosent seem to be all that mucky and dangerous when you have company though!)  Went to a Desi Grad party to celebrate. Tried getting high..but couldnt! Viru got high instead! and a whole lot of other ppl..  Dead tired now...  As you can guess from the post...resolution: write about anything!...but write :-) hmm....or maybe i DID get high!  Now lets toast to that!  Congratulations to the freshly minted Graduate :-)

      Depravity, Laziness & Failure.....like bloody fucking bottomless pit.Sucks you in...and you keep going down.There is just no fucking end to it! I have alredy descended into the nadirs of laziness and failure...Depravity beckons...but as i said before..there is evidently a lot more to go..i just need to figure out how.

      Went for a hike last Saturday...as part of celebration for graduation. Was my first hike here in the U.S.  Surprisingly felt dead tired by the end of it. It mustve been the lack of sleep in the preceeding week that did me in. Anyways it was a fun day.... and I had the added excitement of climbing to the highest point. Everybody, other than me and another guy (Anil) stopped  urlLink half way  and came back (...and probably with good reason...while we were descending the  urlLink summit  we did roll down a few stones & caused a bit of panic :-) But I must say the view from the top was worth it. I guess now i know the kind of feeling that spurs people to climb higher and higher.It seems to get addictive..and highly competitive, mind you!   For intersted people, the hike was to  urlLink Escondido Falls .   urlLink This  is a good site for starters, has an exhaustive listing.  Have posted a couple of photos.  I guess this is enough for a day :-)

      My sleep cycle is totally screwed up...Am in L.A. but follow IST and now i think it is getting really out of hand ...Slept for 14 hrs straight! ...Hmm i guess i need to see a doctor one of these days.  Saw  urlLink Vanilla Sky .... Its one of those movies where you feel there is just enough juice in it to make you wanna watch the next scene..It gets pretty mindfucked before it sorts itself out towards the end. Have really started liking Tom Cruise for the kind of films he is signing lately..." urlLink Eyes Wide Shut ", " urlLink Minority Report"  and now this.....whats  urlLink next ???  Last day of work. The boss has been a real gem of a person ...but I guess I cannot last there any longer. Hope something turns up sooner rather than later...  Waiting for the grades of my last exams..As usual I didnt perform well in the final exams. Will have to hope that my performance in the early parts of the semester will pull me through :-(   Finally got meself a  urlLink Gmail  account ! yeahhhhh! But i dont think its gonna be very useful for me unless they add POP3 support..although it seems light years away for now.....  On another note..if all the activity around the Google IPO is an indicator, I can only imagine the kind of hype and hoopla that must've existed back in 1999. I have a new found respect for all the suckers who burnt their fingers (and their life savings, and confidence!)...Google's style of marketing (exclusivity!) really seems to be working...  While on Google..read  urlLink this  article about Orkut. Sensible observation cloaked in frustration anyone !!!

      The summer is finally here....I can feel it in my bones...and the laziness that accompanies it..although honestly i cannot fathom how much more lazy i could get!  Finally, had a pilgrimage to laundromat..you gotta do that about 3 or 4 times a semester...(not more!) So i feel cleaner and a lot more ... free (???) Life goes on.... Last days at college....Commencement in 4 days!.....3 days at work! Have no idea what I am gonna do afterwards...  Watched "Main hoon Na" ..typical Bollywood potboiler...Masala Mix down to the last spicy grain...was barely tolerable, and that too just coz we were a group and took the movie apart :-)...but it still put me to sleep have to do something about sleeping... I can now sleep on demand...for more than 12hrs at on go :-) No kidding!

      Uhuru......  Thats the Swahili word for Freedom (or I atleast hope thats what it means!)... The exams are over.... The semester is over... The degree program has concluded...(hopefully!) The tryst with academia is over....(really????) My stint here is over...I HOPE NOT!!  The job scene is picking up...with almost a milion jobs added in the year... Funny..how everything changes....Back in India I used to ridicule the singularly American passion of number crunching (thats what i thought back then)...and here I am doing the exact same thing!  Hmm...Another observation....Why does everything I ridicule mentally get played out so spectacularly in my life.....As in, I literally have to eat my own words....Life teaches you a few lessons.....Strong opinions...everything changes with age and experience  Am reminded of the eminent Swiss Astronomer Fritz Zwicky.... One of his mottos was : An Absolute opinion is almost always wrong...So criticize it always :-) Ofcourse, he was infamous for other things too, such as calling people "spherical bastards", meaning, they were bastards whichever way you looked at them :-)    haha!   But why I am I talking about a dead swiss astronomer...!  Guess I must get back to bed!

Have to get back to the application schedule...I think its about time I revised/revamped my cover letter and resume again....hmm now thats somthing to do for the day....  More Later.

            What is happening at  urlLink UEFA 2004  !!! Am no great soccer follower, but England, Germany, France, Italy and Spain are out! who remains??? Well, the semifinalists are Czech, Holland, Greece and hosts Portugal. Will the host country pick up the cup again ???; While we are on it, Euro2004 official website has interesting and thorough writeups on each of the  urlLink previous cups  with snippets and anecdotes from each.        Meanwhile whats up with the drama in pakistan ??? Jamali has  urlLink resigned  (yeah ofcourse "resigned"!) and then why is India still in talks with pakistan ??? What sort of guarantee do the current Pak delegates provide ??? Guess India should call off the talks and wait for Pak to put their house in order. The General now has an easy escape route out of any tough joint-decisions that would have been finalized..as usual...what a bunch of suckers we are!        Here in the States, Dear old Veeps, got tired of verbal acrobatics and  urlLink capitulated  :-) funny, how this is such a big issue here, maybe its coz of all the right-wing conservative trash that W and gang dish out, the liberals are obviously  urlLink salivating  and lose no opportunity...  On a completely different note, have been doing a lot of browsing lately, getting back into the tech-fad reading zone (yeah thats mostly just  urlLink wired  mag) saw this cool  urlLink cordless phone ..absolute droolmaal !!!

      I have a lot of work to do....! A new week begins...Hope it is a lot more constructive than the previous one...  Here is a question, how good are you at identifying people of far-eastern descent, ie. classifying them as Japanese, Korean, Chinese etc ??...  I was browsing the net, came upon  urlLink this site , not politically correct, but fun...I fared quite badly, or rather as the site suggests, "I might as well toss a coin" :-(, Wasnt completely surprised by it though; Asking to discern the nationality is too much for a guy who missed a girls age by almost 10 years!!!..yeah..10 years.. there was this PhD student I was tutoring last semester (statistics...), originally from Taiwan. I presumed her age to be about 23 to 25, turns out she was a whopping 32!!!! I was surprised, to put it mildly...yeah..so that was that   On another note, come to think of it,  urlLink tutoring  at USC was fun, I genuinely enjoyed it...ofcourse it also had to do with the regular procession of cute coeds :-) I was lucky in that regard :-) !!!   PS: my posts seem to have an unfinshed feel to them, or maybe, I should reserve my judgement until later

Well, happy birthday to me....this is birthday season...Sudha's birthday last week, June 14th.....Sent wishes thru Mayur :-)  Another big development..have decide to change my residence, moving to a new home on jef/catalina.....the place seems ok..although i suspect it will be crampy..am used to a lot of space and privacy.....but what the heck.....lesser rent, room-mates who are in the same boat..and definately better food.....I ain't cribbing ~!  Am doling out gmail invites all day...got 7 new invites today (presumably for father's day)...this is after the 7 invites I got yesterday...(why, i dont know..just a weekend gift..eh!)  Job hunting is on..as usual....got a couple of leads that have me salivating at the possible prospects, just hope I dont get carried away and  urlLink tank  another chance :-( A couple of developments on the job front: Possible trip to San Jose this tuesday..another  urlLink job fair  coming up, am still in two minds....havent decided yet. Another development, there's the annual  urlLink SuperComm Conference  in Chicago starting next week, Guess I should follow it to keep up with the trends in Wireless.  Have gotten back to online reading again..refreshed the Harry potter series (yeah...it sounds cheesy..keep the brickbats to urself!)Am currently reading "The Man-eaters of Tsavo" (remember the movie: "The Ghost and the Darkness").... I think its about time i bought another one of those customary wildlife books....ah!...something to research on the net!  Am currently also reading up number theory...mainly Prime numbers ..... found a lot of interesting trivia...." urlLink Mersenne Prime Search ",  urlLink Reimann Hypothesis , Twin Prime Conjecture, etc... Interestingly, there is this  urlLink Institute of Advanced Math , it has identified Seven(7) major problems in the field of Mathematics, and solving any of these problems gets you a chance at a Million Dollar Prize !!!! Now thats "Coolness"!

      A lot of stuff going around here these days... mainly on the job front...but also on other avenues..... have had to make a gut-wrenching decision this week...hope it turns out OK in the end... will update with more details later...... cannot let these times go unchronicled ofcourse ! ... but it is not time yet to put stuff in writing.... hmm...  this week was fun..went camping to the LA National forest.  Long winding route...absolutely breathtakingly sexy! As usual the plan was made at the last second :-) ...its always so with me and Hem. Another friend accompanied us...Priya....rented a car by 8:30 P.M., had a quick dinner and left for the park...had no frigging idea where it was...(coz we had initially thought of going to Santa Barbara...but that plan was changed at the last minute to the next day..!)..called up a friend on the phone..took vague directions on the route..and set forth. the drive was good...and driving on long winding routes at night is also fun  Lot of scenic spots on the way..got down at a couple of them....it was already cold by then..what i remember was the full moon..it was a striking gold in color....yeah..gold...hadnt seen anything like it before...ofcourse..dear old  urlLink hemchandra  brought it to my attention....and oh yeah he also mentioned seeing 2 shooting stars in the span of less than a minute..i seriously doubt it :-) Too bad the camera wasnt working that night..(hmm... a thought ... was that on purpose :-)  Well, then we reached the camping site at about 1:30 A.M. Set up the tent in less than 15 minutes..lit the fire..aaaahhh the warmth :-)stayed up around the fire..sipping vodka and a bit of good ol' scotch...not JD... And ofcourse there was the episode with the chicken..we had a few raw chicken legs that we had planned to roast..but couldnt gather enough decent sticks to hook the chicken and hold them over the fire...anyways, after a lot of trial and error we did manage something ...."burnt chicken" with alcohol for sauce..haha....that was fun.... slept at 5 or so....got up at 8..and left the camping site at about 9:30 A.M. this was my first camping trip inthe US.. Guess I should have done this a lot before :-)  Slept through the afternoon...went on a trip to Santa Barbara in the evening :-).. Next day saw another Desi movie.." urlLink Yuva " this time..I liked this movie..Mani Ratnam hai...so it was bound to be different....had heard mixed reviews about this one...but i guess this was one of the better Hindi phillums I have seen in a while. Also had lunch (lunjj!!! haha....reminds me of EC back at RAIT!) at an Udipi joint at Artesia....Mazaa aa gaya ..life ban gaya....hogged beyond all limits   It sure helps when u have a girl for company....Considering all the trade-offs..its better on the whole i have learnt !   The next day...June 9th..was busy too....got a call from a consultant..the offer seemed quite good...am waiting for the offer letter in mail..had a talk with a few ppl...most say its too early to move to a consultant...even my EAD card hasnt arrived yet....am giving it a lot of thought...guess I will have to pull this consultant thing as long as I can....keep him on the tenterhooks till I can decide for sure...  Went to San Diego yesterday... urlLink Anil  had an interview..and I had a free ride....have been to San Diego too many times already..hell I know SD downtown better than LA now! although I must say..SD is a thousand times better than LA (personal opinion!)   Last week (June 8th) was also Grand Dad's 84th birthday...wow..thats an achievement in itself...and I bet he is healthier than me even now...Here's to you M. Back home in India, they had a big feast..more than 150 ppl turned up I guess..that is huuge :-) A very esoteric and cosmopolitan crowd, Sudha tells me :-) Ofcourse that was expected..having spent a major part of his life in bombay and Africa....besides Kerala.   I hope Dad has taken a few pics.....  WOW.... this post was big ! ....hopefully I will be a bit more regular henceforth....ofcourse absolutely no guarentees:-)!

      A-Ha...  I think I got my routine back....Had to wrench it back into the respectability zone!...I guess my sleep cycle/lack of routine will be another of those things I am known by...wonder why always the mud sticks...and the accolades fall off...:-)  Went to Artesia....saw another Hindi Movie....Hum-Tum....would have been OK if I had traveled by car..but definately not worth a bus round-trip..did not enjoy the movie..but the food was good...$6 All-U-Can-Eat Buffet...desi too, at that :-) was majorly stuffed.... Things to do: get back into the reading mode; both for leisure and work related stuff..but i think unless i get a proper call from some company, i doubt i will get the kickstart i need to put a few things in order...., get that damn license !!!,   So today's june 1st. this month is going to be hectic, i guess...have to decide on moving...have to decide on long term plans too...  I still miss the rains.. early june is the time for rains in Bombay/Kerala ....Here i still have not able to fathom the weather..the temperature drops one fine day seemingly without reason..and the sun is back the next day...thankfully, even though there are a lot of variations, the deviation from the mean temperature is small...so the climate is never extreme....  Had a good start to the month...Got a couple of inquiry calls today from big companies...QC & Mot....hopefully something will work out..something to look forward to....  On other fronts,I guess its about time I put  urlLink Orkut  to use ..eh :-)......

      Have been lounging in the "New Age" Channel on MSN Radio for quite some time now....I think I have heard almost all the artistes they have on offer.....  Here's a list; in no particular order:  Enya, Enigma, Delerium, Kitaro, Nicholas Gunn, Mythos, Amethystium, David Arkenstone, Jim Brickman, 2002, Tim Wheater, David Lanz, Troika, Yanni, Hilary Stagg, David Benoit, Vangelis, Chris Spheeris, Roger Eno, etc etc...  but why am I saying this......well  urlLink MSN Radio  also thinks I have been there for long ..they have proclaimed me a Super-Rater (whatever that means !!!) ..... hahaha

      For some inexplicable reason, I am a lot more bored today than ever.  I thought of changing the title of the blog .....just for fun..  Contenders:  *Elysian (or some other variant) *iBlog :Causerie (it means .... informal discussions, or something equivalent) *inside my head *Forever on the cusp *Born on the Third Base :-) *An Exercise in Narcissism *Colours,Masks,FacePaints & Grease  ......and quite a few more.....  I assume most of these have some merit, but somehow each of these reflects a current mood rather than a continuing thought process. finally settled on the current title, but not before I had tried reverting to the original title "Disjointed Commentary" atleast twice.....!Its been about an hour and I already feel like changing the name again!......Guess, I should wait for a few days to see how much steam this name holds.  Hmm....Along those lines.....I&nbsp;could probably keep a list of all possible names.....for posterity......what else :-)

       urlLink This  was a few days ago :-)  I recently read both of Bryan Sykes books : "Adams Curse" & " The Seven Daughters of Eve" I prefer the latter.......The content in the books is new, well, atleast for me. Sykes basically chronicles the development of an idea in "Seven Daughters" and such books are always interesting to read.  According to the author (now it is an established fact), mitochondrial DNA (m-DNA, or mt-DNA for short) is passed only through females, much like the Y-Chromosome, which we all know is passed only through men. So why not use&nbsp;mDNA analysis for tracing genetic lineage. It took some time for the raw idea to mature into a structured algorithm, but evidently it was worth it.  His work on m-DNA on the European population led him to the slightly&nbsp;unexpected result that&nbsp;practically all of present-day Europeans&nbsp;can trace their ancestry to&nbsp;one of the "Seven Clan Mothers" who lived in the past (ranging between 15000 and 45000 years ago!)  This book was a success and much more than that. Not surprisingly, in his next book, Adams Curse,&nbsp;Sykes tackles the far more complex and enigmatic Y-Chromosome.&nbsp;For me, this book dosent live up to its reputation as a sequel. Even so, it is important in the sense that, Adams Curse addresses a lot of the obvious correlated questions arising out of the earlier book. That segment of the book is the good, but a few of the ideas that he puts forth (as conclusions of&nbsp;his results)&nbsp;seem half-baked. I am not opposed to new/radical&nbsp;stands per se, but somehow, I get the feeling that he needs to temper his views. Ironically, his going out on a limb and asking more questions than he answers might be good for circulation. (hmm...Ironically or Obviously???). I could say so much more...but there are a lot of  urlLink reviews  of his books online, and he&nbsp;IS a famous author anyways.  btw: try  urlLink www.oxfordancestors.com &nbsp;...they can trace your lineage :-) caveat: I think they are restricted to Europeans for the moment though!  All this led me thinking back to my original interest, that of Indian History. Obviously, the same techniques (mt-DNA & Y-Chromosome analysis) could be performed on native Indian populations. Would&nbsp;such a study be able to shed light on vexed nationalist problems involving&nbsp;among other things, the "Aryan Invasion Theory", the "Age&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Four Vedas" Rig Veda in particular, the "Dissappearance of the original Harappa/Indus/Saraswati Valley Populations",and many more questions......???&nbsp;  I googled a bit, and not surprisingly a lot of ppl have been thinking on the same lines. I found a few papers -->  urlLink 1 , urlLink 2 , urlLink 3 &nbsp;(caution, pdfs!!!); but I guess it will take some more time for the smoke to clear and for a definite theory (drawn from these population genetics results) to be formed.&nbsp;Ofcourse, we have to consider the other essentials, viz, linguistics, archeology, and anthropology (as applied to history), but&nbsp;my guess is that nothing can beat the concrete results from Genome Analysis.  Expectedly, there are also a few blogs that i think are worth following. Here's  urlLink one .  Moving on to more prosaic activities, Its been 2 months since i graduated......and oh yeah...did I mention it before, I still dont have a job !!!

      My library privileges have been suspended (not a student anymore!), but the "To Read" List remains:  &nbsp;  Books by Bryan Sykes - Seven Duagters of Eve (???)  Interpreter of Maladies - Jhumpa Lahiri  The Kite Runner - Khaled Hosseini (???)  &nbsp;  ....and a whole lot of books by Indian Authors...  Nothing on the  urlLink NYT Best-seller list  seems interesting, although quite a few ppl seem to be reading The "da- vinci code", obviously it IS&nbsp;the Bestseller !!!&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I guess I should make a list on one of the sidebars.....&nbsp;
