      They told us in elementarry school that middle school was brand new horizon, I was very lucky i didn't go to Horizon.  When we first walked down those hallways, we felt very much like hobitts in a large town. Having everybody frown upon you and tower over you as you walked... Middle School is a complete opposite from elementary. You don't have to walk in single file lines when you left the classrom and you never have to sit indian style during school assemblies. You had many teachers, instead of the same boring, homosexual teacher you always had, for 8 hours...with his gay roommate...and his stupid poodle hair...and his constant grudge against me...and his annoying voice...and his non stop jabber...and his stupid grey shirts that were way too small for him...and his stupid shoes...and his constant grudge against me...Anyway...  Ryan Hewwit was my best freind in the begining of 6th grade, until, the incident... Some of my freinds out there might know what the incident is...but for those who don't here it is... My buddy Ryan...oh God bless Ryan! Ryan had a serious addiction with Brittany Whitcraft...He knew the poor girls locker number!  But knowing her locker number obviously wasn't enough for him...He sent me on a recon mission to find out as much info about her as possible.  One day, we were in PE. Brittany Whitcraft was playing basketball and me and Ryan were on the sidelines. Ryan told me to go out onto the court and look for her... Well I went onto that court but I couldn't find the girl. Just as i started to walk back onto the sidelines, a girl came running by an tripped over my foot...I tripped to and my face would've landed onto that hard, rubber, floor if that girls butt wasn't there to coushon it. Well, when I retracted my face from the organic airbag everything went so slowly...the only thing I could hear Ryans maniac demon laugh in the backround(mabye because it was so loud that it drowned out  everything else)Then I heard a girl sream and shout out " EEEK! BRITTANY! HE'S SNIFFING YOUR BUTT!!" Everything snapped back into place. Things went faster...It seemed as though everything was getting fastfowarding. I started to panic! Thoughts poured into my brain     brittany? Birrtany Whitcraft?!? Is this her butt!?!? OH MY GOD! SENTERFITTS GONNA KILL ME!!! It's all lopsided but i geuss it's oka-WHAT AM I THINKING!?!?! IT'S THE END OF MY LIFE! I Gotta get out of here!    My blood raced through my vains at a super fast rate as my heart beat faster and faster. I slowly stood up and walked very calmly out of the gym with Ryan, my hands shaking. Ryan was cracking up laughing as we walked. " It's not that funny Ryan!"  " Ya it is!"  " Lets just go play tag or something" "whatever...BUTTSNIFFER!!!" "Shut up!" A couple of minutes later. The double doors to the gym busted open and there was Jonathan Senterfitt... Walking very slowly towards me. Behind him was about every single kid in the gym, including Brittany and her freinds. It was   the slowest 35 seconds of my life. The angry mob gatthered and stopped when Senterfitt stepped up to face me. " I heard you smelled my girls butt..." He said blankly. "I-I tripped over h-her and my face landed in that p-per-perticular area" I studdered.  " YOU WERE SMEELING HER BUTT LIKE A FRIGGIN MONKEY YOU PERV!" One of Brittanys freinds said.  " Shut up! Now tell me why you tripped over her" " I-I was on th-the court looking for h-her" I said. " Really? You found her allright!" He said, his dark eyes staring into mine. " It was an acc-accident" " Why were you looking for my girlfreind?" " M-my freind Ry-Ryan has a huge crush on her and I was gonna tell her" " Who's Ryan?" " Him" I said, pointing next to me, but staring right back into those dark eyes. "Who?"  "The boy standing right next to m-" I looked next to me and there was no Ryan, I looked behind me and I saw him...Running like hell. " Thats Ryan" I said, pointing my thumb behind me.  Well Senterfitt finaly forgave me after a quik punch to da stomach. But Ryans little weasel escape really pissed me off and I didn't talk to him for like a year.  I met many many people in 6th grade that I would grow with and socialize with for the next three years. I met Eric Skinner and Yamik Gonzales, two freinds that would continue to crack jokes and have fun with me for three years. I met them when 6th grade went to the science mueseum in the beggining of the year. All the kids who didn't go had to stay with Mrs. Young...It was extremely boring...UNTILL I MET ERIC AND YAMIK!!!! They were really funny! It was goofy! Silly! CrAzY! FUNNY times!  Ok....i'm finished...Well Yamik, Eric and I remain freinds to this very day! Even though it's only been like 20 days since I last saw them...  I also mat Evan Berben, a kid whos styles and interests have changed every year. We were in PE and I saw this little srawney, skinny  beach blonde boy with a huge scrape on his forehead. He introduced himself and so did I. I thought he was abused and beat by his parents. So being the blunt, idiot I was I asked: " Do your parents beat you!?!?" The boy stared at and said, "...um, no...do yours?" "No" "Then why'd you ask?" "You have this huge scrape on your forhead and bruises all over your arms, I thought your dad was a drunken lunatic and he hit you with a beer bottle then your mom beat you senseless..." "Bike accident..." "oh...I was off a little..." "ya..." And for some odd strange reason he has remained my freind since that disturbing introduction. I think it was because he realized that I was creative. Well anyway, Evan has been in every single one of my Science and Social Studies classes since 6th grade.  Another heavy infuence that entered my life that year was Micheal Fletch...uh...nevermind  Mr. Gardiner! WOOO WEE! WHAT A CLASS!!!! When we were in 6th grade they put you in an elective for 9 weeks, just so you could get feeling of each elective. There was an A Day and a B Day. On A day  I had PE and Social Studies, on B Day I had an elective and Science.  ex. Monday I would have PE and Social Studies, and Teusday I would have Technology/Drama/Home-ec/Life Choices and Science. I hope you understand. (if not, post a comment or leave a message in my geustbook)    My 4 electives were: Drama, Home-ec, Technology and Life Choices  (guidance counselor, Mrs. Rist, taught it) The 1st nine weeks of the year I remember having Life-Choices, 2nd nine weeks I had Technology, 3rd was Drama and 4th was Home-ec.  Well Drama, Home-ec and Life Choices were all interesting but Technology was the most hated (yet anticipated) class of the entire 6th grade. We all heard that Mr Gardiner was mean...But we were not prepared for what we were about to encounter... The first day we entered that room he was siting in his office. We were lined up against a wall. He sighed when he saw us and walked out. " Hello ladies and gentlemen, please seat your selves in alphabetical order starting now, you have 30 seconds." I hurried and flopped myself into the first chair. I had the easy last name of Auffenberg. and luckily there were no Adams in the class.  Once we were all in place he said, " Hello, I'm Mr. Gardiner, there is only one rule in this classroom and it is as follows: It's My Way Or The Highway, if you have a problem with that rule please get out right now because i'm not wasting my time teaching you." Then, his stern, cold expression changed into a a grin and he said a bit more cheerfully, "Let me just say this is the funnest class you will ever have the pleasure of being in at this school. It's fun! In the course of nine weeks you will be given three homework assignments, if you do all three you get an A, if you do two you get a C, if you do one you get a F, if you do nothing you get a Zero. I'm going to teach all of you how to make the gizmo inside your head work" as he explained the guidlines and laws of his classroom, our happy, gleefull, no worries school year vanished in the most intimidating 45 minutes of the entire 6th grade...  Well... I got so many ASD's (After-School-Detention) and Refferals from Mr. G, my parents nearly took me out of the class. I defintely did not put Technology on my electives request form for 7th grade...  Another life changing person I met that year was Micheal Fletc...uh...no..nevermind...mabye someother time.       Mr. Bramlett! YA!!! ROCK ON!!! Mr. Bramlett was my 6th grade Social Studies teacher. He was realy cool. He was really funny. He gave way too many notes! Every day he gave three entire pages of notes to copy. first he gave us a Roman Numeral, or topic...then he gave us a capital letter, or fact, then he gave us about 12 lower case letters, or supporting facts to the capital letter fact... Each day we got to XVI...Thats 16 roman numeral topic sentences! Thats 16 capital letter fact sentences! Thats like 25 lower case supporting fact sentences! Thats like: 69 sentences all together!(somebody better correct me in my forum if i'm wrong... PHIL! Your the smartest person who visits this blog! you know my math skills suck. You tell me if I'm right or not! Take your time and figure it out Phil! Thanx!) It was crazy! We were just little kids! But besides all the notes, Mr. Bramlett was really cool. He gave us really cool assingments. Like Historical Imagination assignments...as you probably already know, I'm very creative! So I loved roleplaying and writing as an Chinese silk trader or something like that. He also gave us puzzles! Mr. Bramlett was my last class of the day. So I'd always walk with him to his wifes room (Mr. Bramlett's wife was Mrs. Bramlett...uh..ya), she worked as an 8th grade teacher at the school. So I'd walk with him everyday to his wifes room and we'd talk about everything. And then I'd go outside and wait for my dad to pick me up.      Another event that happened in 6th grade was Brittanys 2nd crush at O2b...His name was Ryan Clemmings I asked her to share her story...  Brittanys Story about Ryan Clemmings. My home diggity. As told by Brittany Filer:  "When i first met Ryan I was 12 years old and i was in the play village area, and I saw a guy who I hasd't seen before and he was surrounded by girls. So I decided to introduce myself to him.  I  fought my way through the girls and stepped up to face him. I said " aren't you a ladys man." Then he laughed and went "well thank you." And I told him who i was and he told me who he was and then that was that, I had to go out to snack. Some other girl also was attracted to that sexy hunk of man flesh, so I got very competitive with her. But we were still freinds. We thought of nicknames for him, my nickname for him was Ryry. So we went over to Ryan, he was in the costume area, and we went over to him and told him our nicknames for him. She told him hers first, which I forgot, and then I told  him mine and when I told him mine he told me that all his girlfreinds had that one. I was really happy. An so, I'd always hang out with him. And one time we were in the think tank and he told me that Cliff was coming, and i didn't believe him. And we got into a big fight and I got mad at him , so I climbed up the Big Toy and I could see Ryan from where I was and he was in the play village. Every now and then I'd shout "Ryan!" And he'd look p and I'd duck down.So after about an hour of doing this, I went down the slide and I sat at a table in the cafe. And he came over and he put his drink on the table, and then he picked it back up and said "I don't want my drink near you!" And put it on the table next to mine. I was mad at him for the rest of the day and the next day, when I returned I gave him a big hug. And he said " I thought you were mad at me" and I said " I can't stay mad at you" And all that year, I was in love with Ryan. Later on that year he ditched O2b and so I got really really really upset and then I saw him on a wednesday at the mall and it was christmas time and he got a job as an elf doing santa pictures, so I ran over and said hi to him. and then I didn't see him till the end of 7th grade... Sometime last year,dad took me,and my brother leno to a basketball game and  I saw Ryan and I gave him a hug...I practically cried when I saw him! I got over him for a while...but he returned once again...in eighth grade"     CRAZY NASTY GIRL!  Well, we'll get into more of Brittanys love life later on. Okay, moving on...I'm pretty sure I didn't go to O2b all of 6th grade except Hollyween. All summer long I stayed home and watched Ernest movies...And Mr. Rogers...And Giligans Island. You know I've been thinking...I think if they killed Giligan or the Skipper they woudlv'e gotten off that island in a week...Well I made a Poll about it and I urge you to vote on what you think they shoudl've done.   Whoever is reading this...SPREAD THE WORD ON KARLS BLOG!!!!!   Wells anyways, I will now dwell into 7th grade....please scroll up....

      When 3rd grade ended I was still in Chance but my mom signed me up for summer camp at O2b. That was my first summer there and that's when I met Brittany and Danny Good and many other freinds that would last me through many years. I went on the feild trips and I had lot of fun!  There were all-time favorite Counselors at owe that year and the three summers after. There was Jen, she was funny girl! She was serious alot though! We had Jay, Jay was real cool. He had bleached hair, he was kinda the original Coach at O2b. There was Nick. Nick was a tall dude, he was also Brittany Filers first crush. Oh lord! Constant "Nick Nick Nick!" thats all I heard from Brittany for three summers!I didn't get mad at him though. It wasn't his fault! It drove me crazy, but it was nothing to what I was about to hear in the years to come.    One time we were at O2b and me, Danny Good, and Kim dared Brittany to go over to Nick and kiss him on the lips. She did so without question. The only problem was that Danny didn't see it so she had to do it again. Now that I remember properly...It was disgusting. I'm still happy that there was no tounge involved.  One day our science teacher, Mrs. Julie, was absent. So some nice little pathetic 18 year old who was just working there for some extra money let us come in and mess with the computers. " Don't go on anything dirty!" He told us. His name was Phil. And he had no idea that that little summer job would go on for 4 years.   4TH GRADE!   My parents took me out of the private school and put me back into public school in the middle of 4th grade. I went to Talbot Elementary. My first couple days at Talbot left a huge impact on the rest of my social life. Most of it started with the food fight. I only remember the very begining of the food fight, it's a little blurry. Me, Jeb, Jared Campbell, Zachary Adams and some other dude where all eating lunch. Jeb accidently flicked some cheese onto Jared's sandwhich, Jared flicked it onto Zacks tray, Zack got all pissed off and smudged his mashed potatoes into jareds face. Jared shot up and grabbed his milk and poured it all over Zach and Jeb...there I was, sitting beside jeb, who was covered in milk, I was confused as hell. Jeb grabbed a handfull of cheese and launched it at Jared. He tried to duck but it got all in his hair. The other dude popped up out of nowhere and smaeared his pizza sauce all over Zacks shirt. Then, the lunch lady stopped the fight somehow and pulled us all into the assistant pricipals office...Miss. Redd...She talked to us one at a time. I simply named everyone who was involved...big mistake...The next day: Jared, Jeb, Zack and the other dude were suspended for two days. I was the most hated person in 4th grade. Girls were actually crying and asking me why i ratted them out! I had no idea that this would ruin my entire school social life all the way up to 7th grade!!!  Well I did get one freind in Talbot that year. He came in after the incident so he didn't care. His name was Ryan Hewitt! Me and Ryan would always go out during recess and pretend we where defending earth against the aliens! It was really fun! I was shooting my pretend little gun ito the air and bringing down the UFO's, while Ryan was running around the playground pretending that aliens were chasing him, shooting his pretend gun as he ran. "bam bam bam" he said whenever he shot his gun. I said it too Ryan! Don't feel bad!   O2B KIDS!!!!!!  Meanwhile, at O2b Kids, me and Danny Good were usually harrassing attractive young girls and constatly hitting on every girl we saw.  ...We were pathetic children... Our first victim was Karlee Melleville. he he he...Oh my God, Danny had the hugest crushes on her and Ashlee New. I wasn't crazy about them. I thought they were very very pretty but i didn't have a crush on them.   Well anyway, one of Dannys little plots was to get trapped in a closet with Karlee. I helped him! We lured her into the custodian closet somehow and Danny stepped in with her. I slammed the door shut and pushed the custondian cart over the door so Karlee couldn't get out, just like we planned. I stood in front of the cart to keep watch. Well Danny was a good actor! But the second he laid a hand on Karlee's shoulder, she swung her entire body against the door. The door flew open, I was tossed into the wall as the cart sped away and Karlee stormed off, " little perverts..." she said under her breath as she walked away. You can ask many many people, and they all will tell you that Danny Good was the most perverted boy on the face of the earth. I just helped him acheive that title!  Karlee was the same age as me but she was much much bigger than me. She took this to her advantage whenever we were at the pool. She could easily shove my entire body under the water with one hand. " Hi Karl!" She'd say as she'd swim up to me...  "Bye Karl" she'd say as she dunked my head under water.  5TH GRADE!  When 4th grade ended, I emmediatly signed up for summer camp. I went into Danny Z's group of course. Every friday we went on a big feildtrip. We went to Wild Waters or Islands Of Adventure or Universal Studios or something like that. Danny begged me to go on the big Roller Coasters but I always wimped out. I always got scared when i saw the giant loops and huge drops. I went on the water flume rides everytime though. Tidal Wave...the big water ride at Bush Gardens is awesome! The wave that the ride makes is huge! The only part i hated about the ride was that my stomach always dropped when we went down the very very steep slope. It happens to everyone but I have always hated it!  Once we where on this train ride in Bush Gardens, I heard this girl talking to this pretty blonde girl sitting next to her about me. The blonde girl looked strangely firmiliar to me. the girl was goin on about how funny i was and how crazy i acted and then she said "Karl." I noticed that the blonde girls blue eyes flashed opened. "Karl? Karl Auffenberb?" she asked her freind. "Well, it's Auffenberg!"  " Oh my gosh! I knew him in preschool!" She said. Then i realized why the girl looked so firmiliar...It was Rebecca! We talked and talked on that little ride. We never mentioned our little puppy love though. Well that summer was the last time i ever saw her.   One time we all went to Universal Studios and Brittany Filer was in my group that day. When we went on Hannah-Barbaras Cartoon ride thing. Me and her were embarrassing O2b Kids by screaming our brains out at the screen! It was so funny! We did the same thing on King Kong and Back To The Future.   I met another girl that summer. Her name was Torry. She was a really nice girl. It turned out that Mr. good had a crush on her. Once again he tried his old tactic. I assisted in this one as well. But we didn't use the closet this time...no...We used the elevator. We stole a snack cart from the cafeteria and Danny asked Torry to help him push it into the elevator so they could get it outside. Well once that elevator door closed, Danny mashed the emergency stop button. I dont know what happened after that...I just remember getting called into Danny Stevens office. Danny Stevens is the strict manager of o2b. Me and Danny spent a couple of days home after that little incident. We were lucky that he didn't get rid of us for good.    Well Torry hated me for about two weeks and hated Danny for about a month. The next thing I hear...Danny comes running up to me me and said him and torry two kissed eachother in the obstacle course. This was hilarious! I spread it all around O2b. Then Torry hated me for another two weeks, and Danny for another 3, since he told me.     Danny Zwillings left for Orlando in the middle of the summer. I was relocated into Chads group. Chad was the coach at the time.   One of my favorite classes that summer was Computer Class. A Mr. Phil Nick tought it. This was the same little pathetic 18 year old! He was now 19 though...Phil was awesome! He was so lovable! Like a hobbit! HE looked exactly like a hobbit! I enjoyed Phils class so much, that when summer ended and the after school program kicked off, I asked to be put into Phils group. even whn Danny returned later that year I still stayed in Phils group.   Brittany Filer gained her first nickname that summer. She was eating with Phil during snacktime and she put a cup up too her mouth and made strange noises and sounds. Phil Nick! God bless him! He told her she sounded like a dying cow! Brit wore a sign that day with the words " DeadKow" on it. And from that day on...she was known as DeadKow!     During that summer, there was a boy who always was playing video games that he downloaded off the internet...This boy started an entire trend at the O2b Computer Lab. He is an O2b Computer Lab Legend...Just below Phil...and just above me...He gave us the Emulators...Emulators are video games from old game systems like Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, that you could download onto your computer and play. It was a huge success! Everyone was playing old Sega games like Sonic and NBA Jam. Phil didn't really care...As long as the kids were happy. The boys name was Freddy Lambes...I had no clue that he was the boy I met years before.   Every thirty minutes Phil is required to go into the computer lab and shout out "Switch!" This means that you had to get off and let the kid behind you play.   That was also the second summer of the CIT (Counselor In Training) experiment.The CIT program is where teenagers (13-16) can experience what it is like to be a counselor...Some of the best CIT's that I can remember were Becky, Greg, Arthur, Slim Shady, and Megan Conlon. They where all hilarious. CIT's all  wore rediculously ugly green shirts.       I also met Troy that summer. Troy was a short funny little man who always brought the two kids he babysat to O2b with him. He was hilarious! He was a good freind of Phil and taught alot of Phils prgogramming classes when he was absent. Troy was the kind of guy you never forget. He helped me write my first HTML website entirely out of code. I wrote it simply with Notepad. It was about something rediculous... "I took the chicken out of the oven and it smelled like poop."  I wrote that and posted it on the internet when i was 10 years old It had some other stuff on it too. A picture or two and some qoutes from Richard Nixon that Troy added in. It was alot of fun. From then on then...Phil enjoyed the webpages I made.  TALBOT  5th grade!  MY 5th grade teacher was Mr.Kirby...I swear to god that the man is gay! Every week he had his "freind" come over and help him teach. They're roommates! His "freind" had blonde highlights and were hawaian shirts all the time. When it was Mr. Kirbys birthday, a freind of mine who shall remain nameless gave Mr. Kirby a Manicure Set! We all cracked up! Mr. Kirby had no clue who it was. He was a mean kid...  Every day, after school, the van from O2b stopped by talbot and picked us up. I had many many freinds in that van. There was little Manny, a little hispanic boy who had some attitude on him, he was in 3rd grade and he listened to the unedited version of The Thong Song. I met Jeffery Cromer, he was a spunky little red headed kid in the 3rd grade that i got along with very well. And then there were the Giles Twins...Brett and Blake Giles were in 4th grade...each of them were going out with a girl i knew in 5th...Thats how "cute and adorable" they thought they were. They were both really cool though. One time we all got into this big wrestling match in the van...Well one of Brett or Blakes fingers went up my nose and scratched the inside of it. When he pulled the finger out it was all bloody and nasty! It's a nasty story! Let me just say that Freddy didn't want to play video games with me when he saw my bloody nostril. Ya...I told you it was nasty...  I remember one time in 5th grade, Jeb asked our music teacher what weed was...If you knew jeb...you can tell that this wasn't his last time he'd hear about the word. He was such an idiot! He told our Music teacher, as well as the entire class that he put a weed, from his lawn, in his mouth and set it on fire!  O2B!  That year, at o2b I met Tyler! Tyler was really cool! He was Freddy's best freind and the co-founder of the Waddle-Dees! The Waddle-Dees was a club that freddy and Tyler started that revolved around Waddle-Dee and Kirby.  ...We were extremely bored children... Everyday, after we got back from Snack Time, me and and other Waddle-Dees would go into the computer lab and hold a "Waddle-dee" conference! I have no clue what we talked about. I honestly dont remember! It was nonsense though...I know that! Freddy was funny!   I remember when we went out to the Gazebo everyday for snack time on the lake. there were catfish in the lake...the grass in the feild had netting in it and we always ripped it out and concocted our very own fishing line. We used safety pins for hooks and crackers as bait...those catfish would eat anything! Well, we pulled a few fish out of that water...but a counselor always had to unhook the poor catfish. They were amazed that a couple of 10  year olds could put all that together.       Well Danny came back that year! But Jay left! Jen left!  We had many coaches after Jay but it will never be the same... We had Cliff, Graham, Sean, Keith, Cristian. They were all great, but on one can fill the void that was lost...  Anyway... when 5th grade ended I could only go to 02b for about a month because my family and I were going to go on vacation in Indonesia. when I returned to O2b it was like the last week before school started. I returned with gifts! I gave Phil a wooden monkey that i bought in a market. And I gave Danny a wooden Komodo Dragon that I bought from some carpenters on Komodo! I gave Brittany and Arthur (the CIT) little wooden Garudas (hindu god). They loved them! I returned with many pictures and many stories. The night I got back I called Phil! His little sister was having her birthday!  Sadly though...the first week I came back to o2b...was the last time I saw alot of people...  I never saw Nick Deice again...Deadkows first love! She said she sees him every now and then. I never saw Becky (CIT) I never saw the Harker brothers again either, they were some good freinds i had. Or Beckys little brother. Or the Giles Twins. Or Manny!  You see, I didn't go to O2b during 6th grade at all! I got so fat that I thought it would be embarrassing to go back. the first time i went back was in the middle of the summer after 6th grade.

      When I was five years old I went to Irby Elementary in the town of Alachua. My parents would drop me off at the day care center every day until I hit first grade...Then the bus took me...To school...(sigh)...So it begins...  In Irby, I barely ever saw the classroom for more than five minutes. I sure did know my way around that office though. I was up there everyday! I was a very very bad kid! I still kinda am! I've improved! My paretns would pick me up from Irby everyday and most days they walked into the office and saw me playing computer games cause the nice lady let me...It was so embarrassing to them. I shouted at the teacher! I never did my work, I could never concentrate on one thing. I always had to be doing something with my hands or feet. My parents took me to the doctor and he diagnosed it as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder).   Well, just because they knew what it was, they never really knew what to do. I had a serious learning disability. It wasn't dyslexia or something that serious but it still stopped me and other students from learning. My parents made a final decision to put me in a private school. They put me in Chance Charter School. I spent 2nd to 4th grade in three mobile buildings in a public park in a small town. It was tough and harsh, I had some good times though.   There was Anthony, he had serious temper problems but they never resulted in violence, just a whole bunch of yelling and screaming. His brother Charles was kinda mentally handicapped but he was cool at times. Anthony was really cool, but he wasn't my best friend at Chance, my best friend there was named Mark. I only knew him for like a year but he was a really good friend. When he left, I was left with Anthony for two years. Then there where the Garrets. Jackie Garret was the principal of the school and her three sons went there. The all had serious anger problems, but the two youngest, Jake and Josh were addicted to wrestling. Me and the two brothers got off at a rough start. They always beat me up all the time. Everything I went to Jackie, she never believed me. I got so used to getting beat up by the two that I started to notice the tactics they used to do it with. I observed the types of different punches they made and different types of dodges. One day Jake pushed me down. I got up and pushed back, Josh got behind me and I turned around real quick and pushed him down too. They got up and started to tackle me. I bit and punched and kicked back until Josh, the youngest, backed off, but me and Jake were still goin at it.finaly Jake stood up with a bloody lip and said "I always thought you were a pussy, Karl."  I wanted to tear him limb from limb. But I didn't, I nodded with pain and stood up and shook his hand. My parents never really noticed any of my bruises, since we never really hit eachother in the face or anything. But I think if it weren't for the Garrets I would of stayed a pussy, ya they were jerks and they beat me up, but everybody needs a bully in their childhood, I had two. The scary thing is that this all happened in 2nd grade.   I toughened up and got rid of the little "I'm so cute" thing and put on a new attitude. After school ended they held an after school program to babysit the kids until their parents could pick them up. I always out with Jake and the guys to explore the old park. Right behind the park was a big field, and the field had an old steel tower that was about 45 feet high or so. Me, Jake, Josh and Anthony were about 7 years old when we climbed that ladder. It was the scariest thing I've ever done. But I didn't complain. The only person who complained was Josh. That day I officially grew balls! I wasn't a little boy anymore. I might of looked like one, but i had the brain of a little idiot!     I met some other people at Chance, someother people who set more of a positive effect on me. There was Mrs. Ponder, who looked past the ADHD and the attitude and saw the bright young boy I was, she took me out of the 2nd grade class and put me right into her 4th grade class. Yhe reason she did it was because i had a 4th grade reading level and she decided it would be best if i learned at a faster pace. Mrs. Ponder took care of Earl, Earl was Autistic. We all had to take up some responsibility when we took care of Earl. There was Antonio, he was the coolest kid i ever knew at Chance. When I wasn't hanging out with Jake or Anthony or Mark, I was hanging out with Antonio, He was like me, he didn't really have a mental problem, he just had ADHD and couldn't concentrate in a normal classroom enviroment, just like me. And geuss who else I met up with at Chance Charter...Micheal! We asked eachother all these questions and then we realized that we went to the same preschool! He didn't cry all the time like he used too...I swear to god that he was a real slow learner though (mabye it was the fence...)Me and him became freinds. No more bitter rivalry...  I also met Freddy Lambes, well it turns out that Freddy was just sick of his old school so he just went there...thats what he says!And finaly...I met the Zimmermens, they were an elderly couple that taught at the school. They where my favorite teachers. the summer before 4th grade was my first first summer at o2b. My parents took me out of Chance in the middle of fourth grade (during that time i was attending the after school program that O2b was having)They realized that i was too good for a private school. A couple of months later, the county shut Chance charter School down...Jackie Gerret was a complete idiot, a lunatic as a freind of mine put it. She threw away the F-cats, she never paid the teachers, most of the funding she received from the ounty she used for herself, she let the kids walk around the park unsupervised. She was real real lucky she didn't go to jail. That was another reason my parents took me out. And it was convenient because we moved into the city and right down the street from our house was Talbot Elementary.

      I was a cute little boy when i was 4 years old. Blonde hair, brown eyes. I went to a daycare called Tot Learning Center. And everyone there thought i was cute! I was really cute! I was so cute I got my first girlfreind there, Rebecca. Rebecca was a cute little girl. Blonde hair, blue eyes. The first time i ever experienced seperation anxiety was when i was four...Rebbeca is like 3 months older than me so when she turned 5 they put her in the big kid rooms. I was stuck alone playing with blocks. I never got moved to the big kids room...they just threw me into 1st grade! The bloody bastards! I was a really hyper and active little boy. I drove everyone completely insane! One time i was in the office with a day care lady and she was talking on the phone...I was just sitting there with the phone right in front of me...It came as a natual instinct...I used one tiny finger to hang up the phone. That woman stared at me in utter disbeleif. "Boy! Get yo butt outta here! I'll be talkin to yo mama son!"  I served a hefty punishment for that one! I don't wanna get in to it though, someone might call HRS... I also ran around in circles, hit myself with things, and laugh out loud for no reason.  I swear to god the things i'm about to say are absolutely true... Bay Watch was, for some strange unknown reason, very popular among the 4 year olds at Tot Learning Center. We used to always pretend that we were lifegaurds. We always got laughed at whenever we pretended to give CPR. Adults thought it was funny for some reason. There was one guy named Charley, he was a volunteer who spent some time with the kids every week. We where all playing Robin Hood, and Charlie played Robin Hoood and I played the Kings advisor dude, they didn't call me advisor dude though...I was known as the Kings " special helper". I advised that we hang Robin Hood and Charly said very sheakspearian... "You shall hang me if you wish! But the poor and my men will carry on my deed and you shall fall..." We stared at him like he was a purple apple...Final my freind Jordan, who played the King, said "What?!?"  Charlie cracked up and ran off.  I always had Will though, Will was my best friend! We was really loyal for a 4 year old! He stuck up for me when I got in trouble and he lied for me when I did something evil...He was my Samwise Gamgee! I never know what happened to him though.   My first rival was named Micheal...I was so jealous of Micheal and i hated him so much! He was one of those snotty little kids! He had a huge bowl haircut! I had a bowl haircut but it was a cereal bowl haircut, not a salad bowl! He always cried and got what he wanted. People just laughed at my cuteness and walked away! Once I always had someone smiling at me and my cute self, Micheal would cry about something and they'd go and tend to him and leave me to play with blocks! One time Micheal fell down and smacked his head against the fence. ooooh! He did'nt pass out but he got a huge scrape on his forhead when his head hit that cement. First the kid hits his head on the fence pole, then he slams his forehead against the cement. This is the same kid who cryed his friggin balls out over a teeny tiny needle prick! I dare not describe the sounds that came from his mouth! I had no clue the human vocal cords could produce moans and screeches like that. He got so much attention over a little scrape and bruise. I was a real attention seeker back then...I was so pathetic that i ran around the play ground banging my head into things trying to get real hurt!  One day, during naptime, Micheal had a bad dream. A horrible, terrible nightmare, he was crying blood! It didn't rain that day but we got two inches of water! It was amazing! The kid had to go because he was so messed up. And he had like four adults tending to his every need. I felt so jealous that I closed my eyes and thought of the scariest thing a 4 year old could think of...the skeleton dudes head from Tales Of The Crypt with a yellow and red spiral behind him. I really tried to cry but it wasn't good enough for Shanteria! "Oh hush up! Ol dirty lier!!" she said to me when i whimpered about a bad dream...  I hope you now realize that i love attention...Now if you think i was a bad kid then...HA!

      I've always enjoyed entertaining people. It's my greatest talent. Here is my story:   I live in a small city and in that small city there's a place called O2b Kids. O2b is just place where kids of all ages get to hang out. It has everything from preschool to homeschool. It has an afterschool program. A summer program. And even a spring break program. There are people who work there called counselors...Each counselor gets a group of kids of a certain age group.   When I  first went to o2b it was on spring break, I was 9 years old. We went to Wild Waters, this was when I first met Danny Z. Danny left a big impact on me that day. His humor and seriousness made him an instant favorite among the counselors. A couple of months later my mom signed me up for the summer program. I asked to be put into Danny's group. I had no idea that when I made that decision I was changing what my very future might become.   Each counselor has to teach their own class. Danny's class was Drama. One of the excersizes we did before we acted out scenes from scripts and such was Improv. I loved improv! In case you didn't know...Improvization is where you act out a scene or situation off the top of your head, but you always get something to work with, like a type of character or a certain situation.  The first class I had during the day was Science. And If i never chose Science for my first class, I never would of met the two bestest freinds i've had. Danny Good and Brittany Filer. Brittany and Danny were both my age. We shared the best laughs! One day me and Brittany came up with a song. It was a parody off the song Pretty Women and it is absolutely rediculous but we still sing it today!    Your mamas dishes! Walking down the street! Your mamas dishes! No they're not looking sweet! Your mamas dishes! "Karl.."   Mr. Seal, you guys shouldn't drink beer! Your mamas dishes! Yo mama!    Well. Every friday each class had to show a presentation in front of all the counslors and all the kids and all the parents on what they learned that week. Me and Brittany were aloud to sing the song in front of all those people. That was the first time i ever got a glimpse of the spotlight. Everybody was looking at me. The laughter...the applause...I loved it all! I've always loved being the center of attention but that was the first time I appreciated it.   Well anyway, the first year Danny left o2b, I went into Kims group. Kim took the role of drama teacher. Kim was the funniest little women on earth. She was a riot!   One day we where doing improv and I accidently said "finking" instead of "thinking". Everyone was cracking up! Kim asked what finking meant and a girl named Meagan Conlon bent over and said "Finking is when you grab your nose and stick you thumb up your butt!" Meagan was a very goofy girl! She's about two years older than me and a year older than her brother Eric.   That little word was the most famous thing o2b ever saw. Everyone was bending over and sticking ther thumbs up their butts!Me and Danny Good came up with a little skit that we performed in Drama about finking. Kim loved it so much that she begged us to make up a play about it. No script...Just practice and memory.  The plot was that I was filling up my car with gas when suddenly this alien thing (Danny) came up to me and asked me to help him take over the world by finking ...we were disturbed children... Beleive it or not! When we performed the play two fridays later...IT GOT A STANDING OVATION! It was amazingly funny! People were talking about it for days.  I got another taste of spotlight and I loved it even more. And I needed more... The only way to get more was to entertain...And i want to entertain people when i grow up. I want to make people laugh... Well thats why i want to be an actor...Now listen to my life story!

      7th grade...What...a...year...     We had a different block schedule. instead of having Science on one day and Social Studies on the next, we had Science in one Semester and Social Studies on the next. The first semester i had Social Studies and in 7th grade we learned about Geogrophy from Dr. Coburn. Then, in the second semester I learned Science from Mrs. Bozeman. But way ane still had electives on A dd B day. only we had two electives per semester instead of four every nine weeks. the first semester I had Art and PE, the second semester I had Technology (I'll get into that later) and Drama (talk about it later).     Okay...now that you know my schedule...here is....7th Grade...    Well during 6th and 5th grade I got picked on alot by the kids because of my weight and weirdness. but torwards the begining of 7th grade, I struck back with an iron fist!   That year...I actually got a social life...scary aint it?                            TABLE 13/15   Well it started out as all things do....in the lunch room.  In the beggining of 7th grade we had assigned seating during lunch. Which meant we had to sit with our AA classes instead of wherever we wanted too. SO! My lovely AA table never accepted me so I lied and told the Cafeteria announcer (Dean Greenaway or Mr.s Utly) that my AA table was too crowded to let me sit with them, so she let me sit at a single table with the number 13 dangling above it. I sat there, alone and bored, eating my lunch...feeling exciled from the rest of eighth grade. I was extremely depressed. Until Ryan Hewitt (who has recently appologized for running out on me, but he still denies my version of the story) Sat by me. For weeks it was just me and Ryan, sitting there, talking. Then, somewhere around Christmas. A certain someone showed up. Someone who would forever change that school, and that lunch room...A Mr. Paul Lefluer moved from Jupiter to our little lovely city. And he, being the genius he was, had no clue where his AA table was...so he, being the genius he was, decided to sit at the "EXCILES: TABLE 13" table. Which then became the "EXCILES AND CLUELESS NEW KID: TABLE 13"   Well after Paul showed up, another new student appeared...Ryan Weiss, a skater punk kid. So then the table was dubbed "exciles...AND CLUELESS NEW STUDENTS: TABLE 13" Paul and Ryan Weiss were best freinds. After that, another kid joined the growing table. Nels. Then Dong Dong Ho (real name, we call him David)Then Matt Baker. From then on...all political hell broke loose. If you put 5 democrats with one republican...World WarIII is unleashed. So then, our table was dubbed: "THE POLITICAL DEBATING EXCILES AND CLUELESS NEW STUDENTS: TABLE 13". Which made us a little happier. And then there was the pointless conversations. Once, during an entire lunch period, we had a conversation on donuts. Thats all we talked about all through the entire lunch.     And Paul always was yelling about something everyday, and always smart talking the Dean. So he was an unfavorite among the Cafeteria Announcers. One time I made Matt Baker laugh so hard that he had milk come out of his nose plus spill his milk all over the table!   Paul was just sitting down on the other side of the table when it happened so of course he got blamed for it! He was so pissed off. It was so funny. Another time, Dean Greenaway was announcing lunch. Me, Paul, Nels and Ryan sang the song Stacies Mom. Then, out of no where, the table next to us started singing it, then the next table, suddenly about 6 tables were singing that stupid annoying song and we felt so proud. Dean Greenaway, of course, classified it as a distraction to people eating (WTF?!?!?) and yelled at us all. We felt shattered.    7th Grade was the year the JP incident happened. JP Latour, thinks he's the coolest kid in the world just because he did a magic act in the sixth grade talent show. He thinks he is so cool! He drives us all crazy! He thinks he's the most popular guy in school just because he knows a few hot girls. He laughs at his own jokes, to make that worse...he steals peoples jokes, and then laughs at them as if they were his own. And then he whines all the time. He threatenend to sue people all the time. He lied. He said his uncle worked at the Playstaion company and he got a free PS3! WOW! And then he said that he was the richest guy in school. You'll never geuss where he chose to sit during lunch. That month was absolute insanity. He was absolutely the most annoying, irritating, bragging, selfish, arogant person on earth and HE CHOSE TO SIT WITH US!!!!! WTF WAS HIS PROBLEM?!?!? Well, I was absent one day, and then, when I returned the next day. Ryan and Nels were in detention and had to clean the lunch room for 4 weeks. It turns out that JP really really pissed off Ryan and Nells and they kicked the hell out his backpack. He whined to the dean and they had to serve detention and clean the lunch every thursday for 4 weeks...plus! They had to also write an appology letter to the little twerp. From then on, JP has not been on our freindly list and he better pray that he doesn't meet Ryan in a dark alley. Ryan wrote a little song about Jp...     "ohhh...you can tell JP by his gut! You can tell JP by his gut! It's 30 inches round,three feet off the ground! You can tell JP by his GUT!!"      By the way...Me, Paul, Ryan, Nels and JP are all fat! So the Table was now being called by the preppy kids: "THE FATASS POLITICAL DEBATING KIDS AND A COUPLE OF SKINNY NEW CLUELESS STUDENTS: TABLE 13"  We felt sad after that.    I met someone very special in my heart that year...someone who could love me like a man....I met Micheal Fl...uh...nevermind...sorry...                             DARRIN BRACEWELL                             THE WORST THING ON EARTH                That year, during the middle of the 1st semester. Darrin Bracewell entered that school and plagued my life for eternity. When I die, my soul will never be at peace, because Darrin Bracewell will always haunt my memories. DARRIN FRIGGIN BRACEWELL CAN EAT FUDGE AND DIE! He had down syndrome...he was more advanced and intelligent than most kids with DS but he still had that irritating voice. HE WAS STILL STUPID!!! He would always annoy me and my freind Eric Skinner in class. He would talk and talk and talk. Finaly, it went from just talking, to friggin following me and harrassing me about my weight when he weighed like 90 fudging pounds and was like a freaking stick. He followed and followed and harrassed and harrassed. I didn't want to be mean because he was kinda mental but finaly, one day i snapped. " LEAVE ME ALONE YOU LOSER!!!!" At first I regreted what I said because I thought he was gonna cry. and then, he did the unthinkable! He grabbed my lunch box, poured all the food unto the ground and put the lunchbox on his head and ran around in circles. I thought he lost his mind. Then he threw the lunchbox at me and made his annoying laugh (a very high pitched " HEHHHH HEHHH HEHHH" mentally unfit type of laugh.) and rann off down the hallway, laughing and dancing. I stared at the empty hall for five minutes...so confused...then I actually blinked and I said "What...just...happened?"   Then I picked up my food and walked to class...I was late and got an After School Detention. Darrin was not on my freindly list.  the day after that...it was worse...He went to the place that me and the guys hang out in the morning and waited for me to show up. then he laughed his annoyingstupid laughed and said "Vwell, it theems, the big boy hasth returned from his mommysth car."   " What...THE..HELL...ARE...YOU...TALKING...ABOUT?"   " OH, I think you knowsth, you knowths very wellsth."   "GO AWAY!!"  " I think I'll thstay here"  " Boy! If you don't back yo slow booty out of here I'm gonna knock yo brain right!"   My freind Labrentae said as he stared at Darrin.  " Get of awayth from me, black boy!"   " HELL NO! OH NO YOU DIDN"T!!! YOU LITTLE WHITE SLOW, RETARDED PEICE OF TRASH!!  " Labrentae, It's okay, let me handle him."   I walked up and faced Darrin face to face. We were so close I could feel his smelly nasty breath. " Get away from me..."   "Fine, I'll leaf you alone..."  Then he once again grabbed my lunch box and did his little dance.  After retreiving my lunch and calming the steaming Labrentae down. I finaly sighed a huge sigh of releif. For that minute...everything was peacefull. Then Paul walked up and asked me, " Did that kid just put your lunchbox on his head and dance around in circles?"   "...thank you for noticing Paul"  "oh...anytime"    The next day:  Well the next day everything started out fine. No Darrin, no problems. Then during Lunch I had a surprise visit to our table from my best female freind at the time: Hannah Nute. "Hey Hannah! Whaddaya need?" I said cheerfully.   "Hannah squeezed into the table of teenage boys. " I nee-WATCH IT BUDDY!! KEEP YOU HANDS IN YOUR POCKET!"   " David! No touchy on the butty!" I yelled to David  " Oh, sorry ma'am"  " Whatever. Karl, I need you to tell Darrin to leave me alone."  "Is he messing with you?"   " He won't stop! He follows me and he won't shut up!"  "Okay. You leave it to me."    The Hallway, the next day:   I walked up behind Darrin and grabbed the handle to his backpack and slammed his back against the wall. He laughed his annoying laugh and went " Wattsth wrong Karl? You'th got a problem?"  " when I say don't mess with me...that means don't mess with my life. When you mess with my freinds, you mess with me. Do you understand?"  He giggled and went "Yesth sthir"  "Good, now I hate being mean like this Darrin but your driving me crazy here."  " Your stho fat and ugly! I'm sthorry, it'sth hard for me"   His lisp was driving me insane. I shook my head and walked away. Then I realized my lunchbag was missing. I turned around just to see Darrin running off laughing. Well, even though i was fat, I ran and ran and ran untill I cornered him in the bathroom. He had one arm extendted over a used urinal, his hand had the lunchbag clenched tightly. " Darrin, give...me...the lunch...bag...now."   His hand opened and the lunch bag fell and his other hand pulled the lever and my lunch was now heavily stained in urine. I had no food and Ryan wuldn't share his pizza. It was officially war...  One day I was late when darrin was waiting for me in the morning. By the time I got there I saw Ryan pulling Darrins backpacks sleeves off. And then dumping all of Darrins stuff all over the ground. I shook my head and walked up towards the ugly scene. " Ryan, give him a break." I said as I kicked the ruined backpack and folders towards Darrin. "Get out of here" I said. "What if I thdont want too?" " Ryan?"  "Ya?" " do you enjoy ripping Darrins backpack to bits?"  "Very much...why?"  "Because if Darrin doesn't leave in 10 seconds, I'm going to let you do it more."  Darrin gathered all his stuff and shot off. The next day darrin came to school with a big orange plastic crayon box with the word CRAYOLA engraved on the side. " Oh my god Paul...does he have a Crayon box as a backback?"   "Ya...but wait...if it's a crayon box.....uh...it's not a backpack..."  " Very good Paul."  "Thank you"  "anytime"  "okay"  "ya"  "How are you?"  "I'm good, how you doin?"  " can't complain..."  "thats good"  "ya"    That day I decided to go to the guidance counselor about Darrin. I told her about how he was harrassing me and Hannah. She solved the entire problem and he stopped bugging me for a while.   Well besides the whole Darrin situations, 7th grade was an extremely exciting year, I made many new friends and I explored the horizons…ok. It was very interesting! I kind of made my peace with Mr. Gardiner that year. It still wasn’t a perfect relationship but he calmed down on the ASDs. I got put back into his class in the second semester. And I was very aggravated about it when I got the notice. He was so unfair and he was such a jerk in sixth grade that I was about to march right up to one of the administrator’s offices and ask to be put into another class. Well, the only reason I really ever hated the guy was because I thought he hated me. He barely ever said “good morning” back to me in the \hallways whenever I saw him. And the day I told him about me getting put into his class, he told me he was going to recommend me to be removed from it. Stating that I was too immature to be placed into his class. Well I was an extremely immature student, the worst! But everybody deserves a chance. And I got it. In Sixth Grade Technology we just did one project and three homework assignments. The big project was building a bridge out of wooden sticks…Very thin, wooden sticks. It was much, much harder than it sounded. We had to sketch our bridge design on graph paper, read a huge book on engineering. And then very carefully build the bridge slowly out of the sticks using precise measurements and equations. We were only eleven-year-old sixth graders…Do I need to say what my grade in the class was? I already told you didn’t I? Well, must I say what my grade on that project was? Figure it out…   Luckily, in seventh grade, we got to choose through a number of different technological modules to work in. We got one partner to work with for an entire semester. I was lucky to pick Tyler Maddox…I can’t say that Tyler was lucky though. Tyler and me became best friends in that class. The first module him and me chose was Pneumatics. Man, I was good at pneumatics! I was an expert at plugging those tubes in and turning the pump on. That module had some complicating assignments and experiments. We had to read five pages on a pneumatic device of some kind, and then at the end of the article it gave us an assignment or experiment with the pneumatic equipment.   We had to work at pneumatics for a long time. When we were done with pneumatics we still clung to the subject but chose a different module…The Pneumatic Robot! It was an electric arm powered by…guess…and we were able to pick up blocks and swing them from one location to another. It was really cool. And the best part was, we controlled it using a computer. It was still complicated though; we had to control the speed of the arm by adjusting the air pressure. And that was so confusing. And then, you had to operate the arm using Binary code. So in order to move the arm to the left you had to type in 0110 and press enter. In order to close the clamp and grab onto to something you pressed 1001 and pressed enter. Okay, anyways, one time Jonathan Senterfitt and me came up with the crazy idea to check out how strong the clamp and swinging power of the arm was. So…I gently placed my nose in between the clamp and Tyler typed in the command to close it. It hurt…then, without any warning, Tyler attempted to command the arm to swing to the left, towards him and Jonathan. Well, Tyler...ooh…Tyler “accidentally” typed in the wrong code and the arm swung to the right, um…I didn’t know it but Jonathan put the pressure on maximum so it swung to the right very hard and very fast. ALSO! There was a wall was to the right of the arm. So… I went unconscious for a couple of seconds, and my nose nearly broke, and Tyler and I almost got expelled from school…besides that…IT WAS SO AWESOME!!!!     Another incident with the robot was an actual accident. None of the outcome was intentional.  Tyler was picking up some blocks with the arm and swinging them to the other side of the platform and dropping them. I was watching the arm from a distance and making sure there were no tubes that were loose or anything. Anyway, the assignment was to put the PSI pressure on like 80 or something really high (I forget all about PSI and stuff…it WAS three years ago.), pick up a block, swing it and release it on the other side of the platform perfectly with out any problems. The point was to show us how difficult it was to maneuver something when the air pressure is really high. Well we screwed up like fifty times, Tyler kept releasing too late and the block kept falling off the platform. So, he tried to release a little earlier. The stupid boy released the block when the arm was in mid-swing. I was standing on the other side of the module and guess who the block hits square in the forehead….ME. With all the different kids in the room. The block flies at me at like 15 miles per hour. Man…Tyler really hated me…  Another time, we were at the Pneumatic module and the PSI was on really high on one of the instruments. Me, being the smart person I am, decided to see what it was like if I pulled one of the tubes out from the device. I was holding one end of the tube, the other end was connected to the air pump thing. It was a very thin tube, but it was very strong and very powerful. That tube was flying around like a snake on Anti-Depressants. The air from the tube was blowing all over the place. It slapped me in the face like 20 times and it, you know, it hurt. I was flailing my arms around trying to keep control of the thing but there was a lot of air pressure in that machine. I couldn’t keep it still for more than a second. Even when I got one half of the tube still, the loose end would snap back and forth violently and slap me in the face real hard. My hands and fingers were getting the worst beating. I was lucky that Tyler was there because he turned the demon machine off and the tube just flopped down, like a string. I stood there, my hair all wild and fluffed up…long, thin, red marks all over my face, my fingers all bruised and sore...AND HE LAUGHED!!!   The evil little twerp. Mr. gardiner walked by our module and stared at me, shook his head and walked away.  Tyler Maddox was really cool though. He dressed like a rich prep, but he NEVER acted like one. He had a funny personality, yet he always kept school on the mind. He was a good friend to have. And he was smart...                                The Stunts  Well...in 7th grade...I did some pretty crazy stunts...
