      Renting isn't cool when the owner wants to sell the house....  Imagine you had planned to.. have a friend sleep over, or something like that.... (in the case of Bunny Custard- having unplanned sex on the bedroom floor... :P) and a real estate agent comes in.&nbsp; Followed by people that look through the house, bedrooms, everything. &nbsp; Well, i got up and left, relying on public transport and took a bus towards, what happened to be the city.&nbsp;   So the house is left open, possibly even them opening your fridge.&nbsp; I mean, C'mon, it's not like OUT fridge comes with the house. Stay the fuck away from my shit.  &nbsp; Well this post was pointless, but at least something was posted... right?

      Well, everyone seems to have natural reactions to certain triggers, or events.  A simple example might be look in the direction, someone is pointing.  Now, I would like to bring the response to a simple enough "hi", "hello", "hey" etc.  This seems to be increasingly common, or maybe I'm just taking better notice. So lets set the scene.   a person:  A person you know, friends with, dont know, etc.  a place:  Anywhere, at work, at school, down the park, street, etc   Example:   I was at work tonight, (supermarket), and a fellow employe walks past and says "hi".   My Natural Response is, to say "hey, hi, hello" back, which I then replied back with. ------> and then!            "yeah, good thanks"    Like what the fuck, I didn't ask how you were, or how things were going.  It is annoying, it's like a superficial response that is well superficial.  It is like you don't even care what is being said, or listen.  Now this is not the first time this has happened, but it happens.    Okay, okay, so maybe it is just me, but i find this response, stupid, false or something like that but then again, I might just get caught up in ignorance in myself.  So my conservation starts with a  "hey",  Followed by a simple question  "What's up?",   THEN THE ANSWER .  *laters*

      Well, got up pretty early and meet up with Shan & Bex.  Went around the city, searching for stuff to do and I ended up trying on clothes they were picking out..  First of all, I never thought I would actually try on some clothes ( especially like 6 or 7 shirts, and 1 or 2 pants/jeans/whatever ), Secondly, never thought the clothes I was trying on, would look like they did..  So, I now have a new set of, t-shirt, jeans and a belt that is on lay-by from City Beach. (or something like that)...  I'll probably get that on Wednesday, when I up with Jai.  Also went and got a hair cut, was going to get a "cut, die, and tips" so the girls called it, but wasn't enough time and way to much for all of that crap, so I just got a hair cut.    Was an interesting day out, may not agree to doing it again, but hey.  Another interesting thing that happened was, i threw a dollar coin in this like swimming pool, type thing in South Bank (if you live in QLD and know about South Bank, you know what I mean)...  Anyway Bex went in to get it, took her some time and to get completly drenched in water, but she got the dollar...  I then lent her my jumper to wear, so she would freeze in her shirt, soaking wet.  ( Must remember to get that back )   Things I learnt:   When shopping with girls, don't. Forget any aims, or things you want. Never reveal how much money you have. Organize the next date/event yourself.  *wanted to get a mobile phone* *spent way to much money* *i didn't organize much of it*   The good thing though was, got to hang out with them, got new clothes (almost like a new image).... and although i spent way to much money, ill be able to recover all money lost in like 2 or 3 weeks working my normal shifts....  (still able to reach my finicial goal at the end of the year)

      Ever since the domain become "active" so to speak yesterday, I'm pleased with the progress.  I got together a basic desgin, a news feature, and even this blog type thing is working.   I'm not sure if I wan't this to be like a "popular" diary to read or not, or even if this "blogger.com" has the capablities to get it the attention of regulary fiary viewers. I've tried www.freeopendiary.com before, and for a person's diary to get regulary viewers is easy, and its common to get random posts.  So, yeah, I guess I do want it to be easier for people to come and have a look.  Anyway....  Getting back to the site progress.  I've attempted to create many a site, some which worked out, some which were used, alot that went no where, or even worked out.  So far this one, is working out.  It is the first time I've owned my own domain before, so I guess that is my inspiration.  (Thanks Shane, for setting it up for me @ matrixau.net)  Writing, is a simple thing which I can enjoy and hate.  The enjoyments comes out of releasing stuff that comes to mind, reading back over it and thinking it isn't that bad.  The hate comes from not being able to express those things that need to be let out, or finding yourself disaproving of the quality, the standard of which I just wrote something.  In the last attempt of creating a site, I made it overly complicated and it just didn't work out.  This one is relativly simple, with plenty of ideas of what to put there, I'm not even sure how I'm going to achieve all that, but I've laided down ideas.      - Keeping things simple - Recording ideas - Setting Achievable Goals  (yes things are simple, but complicated, but its seems to be just right.. hehe atm) (recording ideas, for this i just put down a list of links, that arnt up yet and writing stuff in empty blocks so i dont forget, keeping sites in favourites that help out, etc) (setting goals, well there are things like, uploading stuff, or putting photos somewhere.. or similar stuff, i dont know how to do it off the top of my head but the thing is, im sure i can achieve it, i can make it work, its a challenge, not a walk over)  Anyway, there my thoughts, of how im creating my site or whatever...  - Oh if you come across this comment, let me know who you are and all that crap, feedback is also a good tool -

      Well, just got this "blog" from blogger.com working on my site....  Now i already have a news section that works in similar fashion, but what i wanted was a place i can just write stuff like a diary, rather than it being a news thing....  I'm not sure if this though is going to work out with the site layout i havn't done yet...  Anyway, just seeing how this blog works and all that... I shall see!
