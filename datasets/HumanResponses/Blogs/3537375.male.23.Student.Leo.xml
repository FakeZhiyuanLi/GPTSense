      It was going to be a boring, depressing (See below) rather sleep deprived Friday until I read that story.  In other news, my Handspring Treo 270 crapped out....again.  On to the third device, the second one lasted barely 3 months. My phone tripped into a spectacular death this morning with a plethora of software and hardware failures: 1. call waiting ceased to work 2. battery refused to hold a charge 3. handsfree crapped out 4. voice quality had deteriorated significantly (from the less than stellar quality it had when it was new) 5. dropped calls galore and bad RF performance.  I must admit I had low expectations for Handspring's build quality as their reputation on web boards was less than stellar.  But this Treo device has exceeded my wildest dreams, more accurately my wildest nightmares.    I give the new (who am I kidding?).....  refurbished device 2 months max before it kicks the bucket.  I thought paying $50 for the device was a bargain, in reality it seems that I have merely broke even as the device has much to be desired in reliability.  Of course, I may be too harsh on Handspring, this was a first generation convergence device and I shouldn't expect much.  What I did expect was a device that retails for $400 to last longer than 3 months under normal use.  Shit, this phone couldn't out last a typical Jennifer Lopez marriage for that matter.  And from what I have heard about the Treo 600, the new $500 second generation convergence device from Handspring, Handspring has done little to improve their build quality.  One plus,  major props to T-Mobile for sending me a newly refurbished Treo 270 and providing a free loaner Nokia to tide me over while it gets here.

      It seems that RIAA has once again cranked up the P2P law suit machine.  Given their recent defeat in the US COA, the Record Industry entity is now suing John Does by the hundreds.  Will this slow down P2P usage? Probably not.  An interesting exercise in futility that produces countless false suits against 80 year old grand mothers who don't use computers and 8 year olds.

      Am I the only one who'd like to know what the first year rankings are?  They are only mildly important to our careers in the law; nonetheless, I think one month after grades posting the rankings should be updated.  I officially protest!

      As the link will show, the number one selling album in the U.S. is the new Velvet Revolver CD: "Contraband".  I will not dispute the quality of the music on the CD as great names grace the production such as Stone Temple Pilots and Guns N' Roses; I do dispute the encumbrances that the record companies have thrown onto the CD.  For those not aware, this CD has a copy protection mechanism embedded in it.  For those light on the technology, I will keep things simple: "you cannot make mp3's from this CD".  That's right, you can only play in your CD player just like goodie-goodie consumer the record companies want us to be.  Have an IPOD, guess what, you are SOL.  What's that you say, you want to play the music you bought on another device such as a rare thingamajig called a mp3 player  ( scoffs )?  Well, according to the record industry, you better get a Itunes account and pay for another copy cause you are also SOL.  What's that, what if you dare encode your music in another format such as  urlLink ogg vorbis , like myself ( scoffs twice )?  Well you are totally f*cked cause the intent of this copy protection scheme is to halt that type of use.      You might ask what can the 4 people who read Jack's BLOG do about this?  Very simply, do not buy copy protected CD's such as the current Velvet Revolver CD.  Buying these CD's is an endorsement of the death of fair use of the music we buy.  If there is appropriate consumer backlash, the record companies will cease its use.  If the current trend of rampant consumer acceptance of such technologies continues, copy protection will become the norm and consumers will have to buy one 20 dollar CD for the car, one 20 dollar super audio CD for the home, another 9 dollars for buying the 2-3 three actual decent tracks from a digital music vendor so we can play the music on our PC's and mp3 players.  People, this is the ideal market model for the record companies, if we do not speak up with our wallets now, they will be significantly lighter in the future.

       urlLink  Supreme Court Ruling   The Court nicely upheld the pledge without actually upholding the pledge, Niiiice.  I think Rehnquist, O'Connor and Thomas chimed in on the constitutionality issue of the pledge.  Good for you guys, way to actually make a stand in dicta.  I always enjoy how the Court resolves issues by not actually resolving them.  And, I thought I was the only one who procrastinated doing my tasks.

      It has been a scorcher of a week, it has been hot and humid.  As an engineer, I work best in a cool low humidity environment; consequently, I have not been at my best this week.  Nonetheless, I have mushed onward despite the crappy Gainesville weather.  I broke down this  week and saw Harry Potter, I give it ***.  It was entertaining enough to keep my attention.     Still pales in comparison to LOTR.

             President George W. Bush:  This is a sad hour in the life of America. A great American life has come to an end. I have just spoken to Nancy Reagan. On behalf of our whole nation, Laura and I offered her and the Reagan family our prayers and our condolences.  Ronald Reagan won America's respect with his greatness, and won its love with his goodness. He had the confidence that comes with conviction, the strength that comes with character, the grace that comes with humility, and the humor that comes with wisdom. He leaves behind a nation he restored and a world he helped save.  During the years of President Reagan, America laid to rest an era of division and self-doubt. And because of his leadership, the world laid to rest an era of fear and tyranny. Now, in laying our leader to rest, we say thank you.  He always told us that for America, the best was yet to come. We comfort ourselves in the knowledge that this is true for him, too. His work is done, and now a shining city awaits him. May God bless Ronald Reagan.

         Hi everybody,  Ok, I would be remiss not to mention the plague of biblical proportions that has befallen Washington d.c. when I visited, the city was under attack by this insect called the cicada.  These things are EVERYWHERE and in massive numbers.  Best quote I saw on these buggers was: "Periodical cicadas don't bother to escape when confronted, and the reason is they don't have to -- since they emerge in HUGE numbers,"  These things are so numerous, it is unreal.  It seems like the streets are littered with dead bodies of these things yet they keep coming.  So basically these things are kinda loud too, they make this eerie sound that vaguely resembles the sound of a cricket but nothing like it.  To add to the intrigue, these things appear every 17 years for 2 months only and then die off until the next cycle.  I found all of this quite interesting, I provided a link above for all those non-affected parties who mike be curios about the cicadas.  Have a nice weekend people.

      I don't care how my grades rank relatively, I think I got hosed on my property grade.  I demand a recount.  I will take this to the Supreme Court if I have to! In other real news, another CIA official bit the dust.  What does this all mean?  It means we no longer have Tenent to blame for CIA intelligence failures.  We must no find another person to blame mercilessly for the lackings of the CIA.  Darnit, Tenet was so convenient though.  Oh well.

         Ok, I am getting the soundbites and points from the John Kerry speech last night.  (Yawn)  I did see the salute this morning on the news, LOL.  "Hope is on the way"  "Reporting for duty"  Want some butter with that corn?  Another thing I noticed, look at that huge ass emblem.  Reminds me of those Cadillac Emblems on the back of Escalades.  "Stronger America"  Ok, so from what I understand, on the face of these classic soundbites, the Democrats see America as weak and hopeless as we currently stand.  Damn, I did not know things were that bleak.

      Ok, so I finally watched Mike's Oscar winning movie. Factual inaccuracies aside (see archive for more in depth ranting), I must say as documentaries go, that was very unique style. It was easy to watch and made some "thought provoking" points. Nonetheless, Mike makes some broad assumptions that do not survive strict scientific scrutiny. The movie really is Mike's theory on why there is a bevy of gun violence in the US. The short of his theory is: "it's all Charlton Heston's fault". The long of it seems to place the blame at the foot of ineffective gun control laws, a culture of fear created by the mass media, and the fact the US is not a socialist country. I agree with his first claim, and disagree with his last. His second was probably the most salient point Mike made. Although I watch very little TV other than movies and South Park (which had a prominent part in the movie), I agree wholeheartedly that the mass media in this country profit off of fear.  See generally  Local News. Whether it be that purse snatcher in the bushes or that chemical weapons toting terrorist, the media wants you scared and watching. Speaking of broad generalizations, Mike does make use of a true broad generalization: most Americans know zero about history and foreign policy. He makes effective use of examples of America flexing its military might to pursue our national interests to paint our government as a violent entity bent on launching tomahawk cruise missiles at anyone who we dislike. An over simplification to say the least.  I not going to even bother  with that one.   Mike's movie was significantly based on anecdotal evidence in the US and Canada. Makes for great entertainment but bad science. In the end, will Mike make any real progress in determining what causes the violence in this country, probably not, but at least he'll get the masses to think about it which in the end is a plus.

      So I am headed to lunch today and while in my car, I make the horrible mistake of switching the source from my Iriver H120 to the radio. Given I have no need for normal radio stations, I immediately start listening to talk radio. Uninterested in the current Rush Limbaugh tirade on liberals, I switch to public radio hoping for some classical music to sooth my soul. To my horror, the current broadcast is Michael Moore doing some sort of standup comedy. It was real weird to say the least. I don't know if he was in Bush smear mode or if he was genuinely trying to be funny. Being the open minded fool that I am, I decided to listen to Mike's comments. To say Mike makes broad assumptions is an understatement. He was complaining about 160 million Americans that did not vote for Bush in 2000. I could verify that # but I rather not spend the extra effort since he probably made it up or made another legendary broad generalization. I figure he extrapolated that comment from the 150 million people who choose not to vote or even register in the last election. Now that's an assumption, they did not vote for anyone so they did not want Bush. That rationale is easy to follow.   So Mike continued his rant about his publisher was oppressing his First Amendment rights by asking him to edit some passages of his book, ostensibly "Fat stupid white men" I think. Mike, your First Amendment rights do not include the right to have your thoughts published. Just like you, the publisher wants to make money and can publish whatever they see fit free from government repression. Note the publisher is a private company, no First Amendment analysis needed. Of course the next 15 minutes was Mike lauded his book as being in touch with America and hitting the best seller lists with impact. Mike, a lot of books become best sellers, a good portion aren't worth much. Nonetheless, I digress. I figure this is a great segue into my review of Bowling for Columbine (Bowling), which I recently viewed. Shout out to Ryan for loaning me the DVD.

      Besides, I have better things to do like defragmenting my hard drive. For everyone who decided to expend their time watching the new Michael Moore propaganda piece.  I highly advise you take a look at the glaring factual inaccuracies that many people in the media are picking out.  It is disappointing that such an "important", as described by certain Moore activists, movie is made irrelevant because the man can't seem to grasp the idea of fact checking.  I am not taking any position on quality or the talent of Moore in making movies, as I have yet to see Bowling for Columbine, something I plan to watch this weekend, and I probably will never see his newest endeavor given its factual misgivings and its virulent view of the President.  In my short 10 minute search for legit sources listing Moore's fictional escapades, I even found this  urlLink Wall Street Journal editorial  that hammers Moore's facts in for his Columbine movie.  I don't know about you but this devalues the legitimacy of the movie when I watch it.  Every scene regardless if it a good scene or if it makes a telling point, in the back of my head will be "is this bullshit?".  I guess what I think matters little as I suppose most people, who see the movie, will sadly swallow Moore's claims.  Nonetheless, I give Moore credit for his latest movie.  He knows the average American is highly uneducated on foreign policy and lazy; thus, most of the liberally oriented people who actually see his movie will accept his version of the facts wholeheartedly.  He wants to affect the election as he has so frequently claimed. What better way then releasing for intents and purposes a anti-Bush propaganda piece that he has characterized as "political satire" in the guise of a documentary.  I also have heard that Moore is reposting aticles on his own website but editing comments that mention his critics.   Maybe I'll check that out and get back to that one later.  (edited:  I checked, yes he did edit out references to the two websites listed at the bottom of this post.  My response: lame, the article is praising him too, very sad.  )  That is pretty sad.  I have enabled comments, so feel free to chime in.    Some places of interest I found   urlLink moorewatch   urlLink moorelies

      What an interesting way to start my day, provided link to the story for those interested.  "A dispute over clothes and a  video game system  between a young woman and a squatter in her grandparents' house apparently sparked the vicious beating and stabbing murders of six people whose bodies were found late last week in a blood-spattered home, police said."  I am currently hanging out in D.C. with my illustrious girlfriend. I managed to get out of the apartment today before noon. Yeay for jack and mediocre work ethic. I cannot fail to mention the current loaner car my GF is sporting right now, a beater 88 jag. She gets her new car sometime today. The jag is suffering from classic British build quality syndrome. The list of malfunctions.... (drum roll) 3 out of 4 door handles do not work from the outside, AC does not work, the brake pressure is low, trunk does not open through either the internal release or use of the key, alignment is off, wheel cover/lock is missing, gas cap does not close, sun roof does not function properly, trip computer has failed completely, the car vibrates in reverse gear, and no cup holders (i know that is not a malfunction but i spilled my coffee and that lack of holders is plain stupid). I am sure I'm missing something, but I've only driven it twice.
