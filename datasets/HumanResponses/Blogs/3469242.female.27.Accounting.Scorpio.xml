      Well, we got some sort of commitment from the bank.. with conditions.. who the hell knows what those are gonna be since SOMEONE was too excited to ask.  So now we'll have to wait til like Friday (prolly when I get home from work at 5:30 or so) to find out.. if I'm lucky... but I'm not so "the end of the week" mantra of our house for the 4th week in a row now.. Ugh!  We have til July 26th to get a damn closing... argh!  Knowing us, our seller won't fix the house in time and we'll be more delayed.  bummer.  Nothing new for the house besides my pretty pottery that I'll need to get a pic of to show off.  I should be able to pick up my knobs by tomorrow after work but with Rob working he might have to get them for me on Thursday morning or something.  Hope they're as cool as I want them to be!    I don't recommend anyone ever buy a house!  Ugh!  Hopefully it will be September before I know it.

      The purpose of this blog is to let you all know what's happening and when and what we're thinking!  Hopefully I can keep everyone up to date with my ideas and where we are in the process.. as well as update what we've done! :)  So, here's the stuff from my other blog.  Pics of the new house!   urlLink Here  and  urlLink Here  are some pics I put up! Enjoy!  As of Sunday, June 13, 2004: We're waiting for the mortgage commitment letter so we can get a closing date.  We released the contingency thingy that we made with the offer with conditions they replace the front steps to the house (the wood ones) which also need a handrail.  Also, in the house we need to have handrails put up, a smoke and CO detector, and they have to cap off some sewer thing.  Also figure out how to get the side door open since the vinyl is too high for it to open atm.  Not a whole lot so we're just waiting to hear if this is acceptable conditions they have to fix before closing.  :)    I also opened a house checking account for the fridge and oven we'll need as soon as we move in properly and any other little things my job is to cover atm :)  All very exciting!

      Well, not a whole lot to report this week.&nbsp; We still don't know what's going on.&nbsp; They still want Rob to liquidate his 401k and I still don't want him to but it looks like it's the only way to appease them so we might have to.&nbsp; Everyone else seems to think we're buying this house but us.&nbsp; The realtor and the seller are working to get it fixed up, our attorney is getting us a closing date, and our insurance agent is writing up the homeowner's insurance.&nbsp; We are packing but we only have less than 3 weeks left on our lease here so we're moving somewhere by the 15th, who knows where tho :P.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nothing new for the house this week but I put some stuff on the amazon list that was little stuff I'd like.&nbsp; I still have a bit more tho.&nbsp;   Still in love with the chair from Raymour and Flanagan.&nbsp; Still need a stove and fridge.&nbsp; So nothing new there :)&nbsp; I sound whiny but that's cuz I'm worrying.  That's all she wrote.

      I wanted to mention that when Dimitri died we snuck over to the new house and buried him in the backyard.  So now we really gotta buy this house!  update for today:  It's Weds.  I don't know what Rob did today but yesterday he was a good boy and paid most of his old debt and made arrangements for the rest.  That means he's prolly gonna have kickass credit in a year or two.. but for now we'll settle with buying our house.  Hopefully we'll get the landlord reference by friday and all the other riffraff for this and we can supposedly have a closing in a week... a week to my bank means 5 tho so take that as you want.  Today Rob was supposed to call people and get a copy of the downpayment check and all that good stuff.  There's no doubt about it, M&T bank sucks ass.  Big wet hairy ass.  On the plus side, Rob's mom found a chair like my sister in law's and it's not too expensive so we might splurge on that in a few weeks :)  We'll see *crosses fingers*.  Rob wants 2 pugs now.. he thinks we need a Murphy to go with the Matilda I want.  I'm not convinced!  that's all for now!

      So, this weekend's trauma is as follows!  When Rob first went in for the mortgage we were hoping to do a Sonyma mortgage.  This is the world's best program for low income people.  I'm not cheering that we're considered low income, but they consider under 47k for 2 people low income so we are.  Anyway, with this program we'd get a bank loan at the rate of 4.25% which even in the best of times is an awesome rate.  Well, in order to do this program we had to fork over 2k to close out all our old debt and with me not yet at work and us just barely going to scrape into this house, we decided to screw it and get the conventional mortgage, which didn't need us to do such a thing.  Fast forward 6 agonizing weeks, we get a call last monday that we're finally officially approved (tho we've been told all along we were, we just never believed it) but there are provisions.  My husband, in his infinite wisdom.. no, I really mean stupidity, was so excited about this that he didn't ask what the provisions were.  Then, friday afternoon, July 2nd, last business day before most people go on a 3 or 4 day weekend, at 5pm when I get home from work, I pick up the mortgage commitment and read these so called provisions.  Now why, in the 4 full days we knew about these provisions could my husband not call (he's the applicant so I can't) and find out what they were, he'd just prefer I find out on Friday, when there's noone we can talk to.  Provision problem:  you must pay off that old debt.  Yeah, there it is.  Albeit, 6 weeks later we're in a better place to pay this off since i've been working for 4 weeks and we're not yet needing my little nest egg for the fridge and oven (even tho he needed some of it to put in his account).. and his stocks were recently purchased (a whole 11 shares).  So, 6 weeks later, we've got to pay this off.  Now, obviously, we would have qualified for that 4.25% loan and not the 6.55% conventional.  Can we say Fuck?  The mortgage dude swore up and down this wasn't a problem.  But we were lied to, to the ending up tune of 18k.  Yep, that nice 2.3% or whatever will eventually cost us 18k over the 30 year life of the loan.  How nice is that?  Thanks mister!  Obviously, we're not as shocked at that 18k as we would have been had we still not been able to qualify.  But since we couldn't qualify we went with the smarter choice of ease.  I mean we still don't plan on being in this house for the rest of our lives or never refinancing but how does this guy sleep at night baldfaced lying to people?   I'm not as mad as I was yesterday, but it's still bitter tasting.  On the plus side, I picked up my knobs.  I wish I had a digital camera to show them to you guys but you'll have to wait til I build my nest egg back up to afford a luxury (considering this Friday's paycheck is already prespent on rent since Rob's money is going to pay off these old debts)  And it's not like hundreds of thousands of dollars, we'll handle it, just not going to have as big of a cushion as we would have liked to have had walking into a new house.  Thank goodness I got a job tho.  Anyway, I think that's it.  I'd like to pack up some more but we're still nervous about all this info... including finding financial references.. like our landlord.. please let the space cadets give us a nice letter.  We were good people, just don't blame us for forgetting to pay our rent for 8 days!  We never bothered a fly in the 5 years we lived here!  I need a pug.. badly.  Rob called the lady about them.  500 bucks includes first shots, she has 10 pugs, 3 are retired, so 7 little puggies are gonna help me get a pug.  She said call back in late August or Early September.  Maybe I'll have a Halloween pug!  Okay, that's all for now, I feel better.

      We're homeowners!  Aren't you excited?  We prolly won't have a phone for a while cuz we found we only had 1 jack in the foyer and none anywhere else so we won't be able to do much til we get someone in there.  Frontier wants like 70 bucks for the first jack and 60 bucks an hour each additional jack.  Ugh.  Oh well, we'll figure something out.  We have to do it, not like we can live without a phone, right?  But if anyone reading this knows of a phone installing type person in the Rochester, NY area, feel free to put in a comment.  Considering I can't get my email unless I go to someone elses (not work's) computer, I think that it's gonna be very hard to get in touch with me.  Guess there's the cell phone, but I'm not posting that here :P  We hadn't caulked the tub by the time we passed out last night so we had to go back to the old apt to go shower and get dressed but we had plenty of time and we made it to Tops so I could get lunchable type stuffs since we hadn't thought about that (or most of the stuff we should have been thinking about.  My beautiful moving system shot to pieces because Rob packed my notebook and marker.  Cuz that needed to be packed, right?  I should have taken the whole day off yesterday and managed, things would be easier to find.  Oh well.  Tonight we work on dishes and laundry.  We being me, of course, since he has to work tonight til 8 or 9 and I'm only working til 6.  Wonder if he got anything done from 8:30 to 11:30?  We'll see, I suppose.  I'll try to keep ya updated on where we are as I can.  Directv satellite should be in the mail today :)  b

      and I'm prolly too damn excited to sleep and the closing isn't til Monday.  Didn't I mention?  Oh!  We got a closing date :)  On Monday, at noon, Rob will be signing his life away (all cept the part I own :)) and then we get the electricity turned on and then.... MOVERS!  At 2:30pmish, a flock of movers (that's how they come) will descend upon my tiny apt and carry away all my junk to a bigger house we can't wait to mess up! :)   We've still got a fair bit to pack and I almost feel I'm sort of lingering because I love to pack so much and we have to stay home most of the weekend to insure we don't spend our closing money which we STILL don't have a total for.  That's really really scary to me.  That's prolly scarier to me.  Anyway, time to go help someone on the mud since I'm up anyway.  ciao for now!

      Still waiting for a closing date.  Packing our butts off.  Trying to plan but what can you plan without a date to move?  Less than 2 weeks left and no plans!  This is driving me crazy.  Rob's parents want to hire movers for us.  I'm not too sure about it.  I am too compulsive obsessive to let other people touch my crap.  We'll see.  Otherwise, we're ready when they are.  We're hoping late this week or early next week since that's when Rob will have off and time to do all the work (and hopefully without nagging!)  There's absolutely nothing they can ask us to do, i think!
