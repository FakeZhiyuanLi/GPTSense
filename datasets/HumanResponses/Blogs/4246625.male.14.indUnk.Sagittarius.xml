      Life continues into the future, time flying by like a bird in a jet in a rocket on a planet which travels at 6578 km per second, or something like that..hahaha, well i broke my second Quantas headphones today, when i got angry at the clanking noises it was making whenever i tilted my head, so i took them off, smashed the damn thing on my table aobut 67 times, then opened it up to admire how much damage i managed to inflict...well, it's obsolete now, and i'm starting to run out of nice padded headphones that caress your ear like mittens do to your hands, and wooly sweaters to you're body. Sigh...the pleasures of decadence.  Well, today, I went to church, which is normal for Christians, as you might have noticed, and i came home, a little unmoved by the sermon. Sermon's aren't always fantastic and heart moving and soul releasing. Normally they just expand you're already wide knowledge of theological concepts...or God. No, sermon was dull, and I arrived home with my aunt, who followed my mum home to "check out" some of the goods we were importing..  Argh....my left hand feels like rubber, dead rubber, because ever since i'l come home, all i've been doing is chatting with Karen, audioing with my cousins, and making Graphix with help from Darkshrimp A.K.A. Andrew. This is my boring, laid back lifestyle, i was gonna blog yesterday...did i blog yesterday? My memory is slowly fading, and my mind is slowly rusting and decomposing, as well as getting more and more sickening and stale by the minute.  Pornography you say? Isn't that too sensitive an issue to touch on? I'm a Christian, I'm not meant to be looking at this right? Right...too late *slap slap* my guilty conscience tells me  NOOOOO DON'T DO IT ! While just about every other part of me says "Let's get horny baybeh!". It's not very often that i manage to refrain from browsing the net for pictures of women and ladies who undress themselves for money and to temp young men like me. It might be the nature of boys, but it's not necessarily a good thing. Guys don't want to talk about it because almost all of them have seen it in 1 form or another, just like the 100 people who decided they weren't gonna have sex till marriage. They probably already screwed 10 people! And if they're guys, they probably jack off every 10 days, which is a practise that I am intelligent enough not to undertake. Jacking off actually hurts yourself, and for the girls that read this...well, i'm don't know if girls share these hormonal emotions and urges, but i think that they will understand better why people whack off, my dog, was on high today, and although i don't know and don't plan on knowing how they do it, i'm sure they get high and have they're own form of masturbation. Well, now that I've scared majority of readers away, I can move on to the more dull part.  Homework, homework, test, life as a student revolves around this type of thing doesn't it? Well, I'm pleased to say that i try to do as little of it as possible. Year 1 to year 5 i was a little rebel, spending most of my days standing outside the class...staring out into the peeling paint of the white walls within the confines of my primary school, which brings back fond memories... I loved primary school, even with all the punishments and all the fighting...i still liked it. Primary school was a good time. Then enter High School in Chung Ling, when all the values from Primary School like caring about other people, trying not to truly insult them, reduced violence, all just evaporates, and produces people that are different, intelligent people who don't want to work hard, but have impossibly creative minds, people who chase blindly after a goal, eliminating all things that stand in their way, people who are so truly zealous about their religion or beliefs that they are willing to be criticised, mocked and abused to protect their faith, people who hide their emotions from others, who have no conscience and are friggin smart, understanding things the way they appear. Some people however, retain certain morals, like Hui, who although is smart and popular, manages to be humble and modest in her actions, Ray, who although may be different from others, bullied by those who try and try to break him, still manages to smile and laugh in all situations. Ja, who barely tries to do work in class, and never tried to please teachers the way others do, manages to create a blog full of creative flair and originality. Karen, who even after all the evilness, and appearance of uncaring, can still love others and care for others, so much so that those people including me, feel loved. But not going down into too much detail, although people may seem rebellious, arrogant, bitchy or aggresive on the outside, all people have something in them, some kind of emotion, we are after all....still human.  I'm sure almost everyone has stopped reading at this point. Well, my left hand is recovering now and i can type a bit faster. I love my cousin forever! She is so merry, and so innocent..hahaha, makes me almost jealous of her, haha..reminds u of someone else's blog? Well i do dote on my little cousin, even though her father is a bit of a prick. She is cute, damn funny, and totally straightforward, sometimes a bit annoying, but most girls are that way...haha, man, she just brings a smile to my face.  Lately I've been worried about people hating me and things like that, if i were someone else, i wouldn't really care, but i think that i think people hate me because they don't talk to me or they avoid me or they just say bad things about me. I think i'm wrong, maybe i just met them on the wrong day, i guess perhaps they were having a bad hair day. I try to take criticism as complimentary, which once again, in this society isn't something people always appreciate, these days all people want is "individualism" and "self up ness" aand in some ways these things are good, however, being being arrogant, stuck up and stubborn doesn't always help you make friends. Anyway, after i began my little transformation of personality, i beagn thinking about why i think that people hate me, then i realized the real reason they "hate" me is because of somethhing that Lisan said so nicely "I ..just.... don't know you!" That's why they don't talk to me, that's why they avoid me..cos they don't know me. However, if they truly hate me, they won't get much love in return i can assure you! oooh...yeh...*click knuckles*  Well...i thank karen for annoying me with her nicknames that are meant to damage my "reputation" as a "nice boy" and i thank everyone else for not letting the whole damn school know about this blog, because then I would have alot of audience to appeal to ..lol , jk jk, luv all of you guys and gurls , BYE!   Porn- the stuff boys look at to make goals for their future.

      So i've blogged about this just as i planned to, the idea for this blog came up when i was sitting here chatting with Ray and i noticed that my stomach looked like a totally different part of my body, not like when someone is pregnant, but more like when someone has eaten a giant piece of tough jelly and it won't digest....  Fatness is so common in this world of sedentary lifestyle, where people can get stuck to the computer or the TV so easily. Basically, it's become much much easier for us to become overweight then it could ever have been, and somehow boys are much more susceptible to this "disease" called fatness or in serious cases obesity. Just take all the girls in our school for example, almost every single asian girl either has a BEAUTIFUL body, or has a close to perfect one, and only a few are a tad fat or a tad anorexic (no names please) anyway, boys on the other hand don't all have perfect bodies, there are many lanky ones, and many more well built ones, but there are also quite alot like me, except i don't see many chinese ones, maybe i'm special :P  Why do we get fat? Well, firstly technology, but more importantly , it's the quality of out living, not everything revolves around food you know, the parents take it too seriously , the kids eat the food and get fat, so what? Isn't it the parent's fault then? Why do they give them money to buy the food? Why don't they pack their lunches for them like traditional parents used to? Why don't they make them work in the fields of barley and wheat...okay, that's going a bit too far, why do the kids get married to the computer? Because the parents allow them! We never hear things like "Go outside and play" these days, well, i'm aiming this at people of chinese descent mainly because that's all the audience i have, but how can we be so ignorant?Not willing to accept the verisimilitude that we just can't stop eating and that our metabolism IS normal!?  There can be no end to fatness, people have always been fat, some people say that they are fated to be fat, well, i guess then you're fated to have a stroke or a heart disease and die young as well eh? Eh? hahah....  Anyway, moving on to yesterday, it was school first up (duh!) and sose, the last night i heard something about bullies taking over the recess area, where we play cards, and i was hoping for a fight of some kind..well expecting it anyway, so my heart was pumping like a er.....pump during sose, and everytime someone did something..a litttle bit wrong, i hated them, but then again those people happened to be the troublemakers, man....sometimes i feel like jumping on them..then i had commerce;which now is the worst subject ever, not only has Vicary developed a kind of Anti-Ben thing, i've also developed a natural affinity to teachers, and it just so happens that Vicary is one, and i can't help but suck up even though i don't want to cos she's like the worst even though everyone thinks she's really cool even though she's so narrow minded and so confrontational and just because she can tell good stories, doesn't mean she's cool at all! grrrr.... :{ :[ barrrrrr..  Back to reality, after that dreadful class, i skipped to recess area, which i have fondly named "Recess Area" and i saw the bullies, i would have fought them except most of them were the friendly ones, so i just spoke to them nicely, however, most of everyone else wasn't there, so they didn't get the message, and it just so happens that the person i hate the most arrived late and decided to take a card of MY deck, so i decided to push him around a bit, next time i might try punching him, or kicking, it would work better...other than that, everything was uneventful, and Ivan and Sig didn't need to help, but thanks for watching my back anyway guys!  Science, i think Mrs Darling is starting to get bored with staring competitions, even though she's such a wonderful person (gosh, golly, fairy tale words! I'm becoming like Ryan from Big Brother! which is like the most boring show ever even though i've seen about 100 episodes) sigh.....well at least i had fun mistreating wanjie and tran and jarryd and karen and jenna,whahahahhahaha! English was usual, nothing new, except i realised how hard it is to converse with Ja when all you have packed in your head at the moment is your crush and lame jokes, so i decided to let her whisper stuff to wanjie then laugh as if they made a joke about someone else and they were laughing loudly on purpose so the person would know that their been mocked but not know what the joke is, hahahah! I like that ;)  I was a bit of a hypocrite during english too, Ja was saying something about conversations being hard to read when someone types with lots of smileys and ......'s and large and small letters, and i agreed with her when i realized that she must be referring to me, cause i do that alot...... but i guess everyone shows some kind of dissimulation at some point in their life.  After that everything got really fun! :D :D :D hhahahahaha....I still can't stop laughing...in Chinese, firstly , i invited John to a non existent party, but of course, since i'm so nice, i told him that there wasn't one, ..which i find really depressing..cos i wanted one(sobbing), but before my blog gets too unbearable, i'm gonna move on to the Nessie Chronicles (whahahah) firstly, i was going out to photocopy something when nessie, coming back from photocopying ran straight into me...she had the book so i told her to go and photocopy it for me,and she was like "nooooo" and trying to get away ..hahah..sorry nessie,i still  love  u! then, she took me to the library to photocopy, and i told her to take it to the office to photocopy...dammit, why am i so inarticulate today....sigh, oh well, so she took it to the office to photocopy, and she became aware that she wasted 10 cents, and bla bla bla, after class i took her water bottle, and she was like screaming at me and trying to hurt me and stuff (anyone else would have pinched me or castrated me (in that sense) so thanks nessie for being so nice, but i still drank her water (OMG!) and well, she got pissed and i laughed and ran out to fill the bottle and wash it, then zong hao told me she was crying...  Given that piece of information, my brain and conscience told me "SHIT! I caused trouble again...oh man...i feel really bad now, why do i always do this..oh man..." then Zong told me she was in the toilets , so i decided to go and get her (whahahhahaha) nah, but alester checked for me, and no one was there ... then as i was walking back Nessie appeared from nowhere and started shouting at me...and i told her i had cleaned it, and she said she was going to throw it was because I had handled it(note, it was said like this - "BECAUSE  HE  TOUCHED IT"), now that's more than enough to break anyone's spirit, so i crumpled and crawled away...speaking of crumpled, Sorry hui about scaring u, and hurting u, :P i didn't mean to..oh man..this is making me look like an ugly bully..waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa....oh well, life goes on.  So after an uneventful cell meeting, and a boring stay over, i've come to this part of my life, where i just can't bear to read everything i wrote before because i'm scared that i've made a mistake somewhere, just like in my essays, i never proofread them becuase if i do, i always find some error somewhere and that just ..beat me down and bashes me up.  Whatever, this is like one of those "not in the mood to blog" times, so i guess it has alot of nothing at all, but slowly more of my violent and evil personality will come out..no more mister Nice Guy. :D Once again, sorry to Nessie (hugs) and Hui (osculations [hahah, jk jk]) but in the end, the joke is always on me :P   Without fat, there is no one to mock , no one to hug like a teddy bear, no one to poke , no one with enough of themselves to share their love around.

      I know the title sounds like something really really morbid, and nothing to look forward to, infact, i'm not even sure if anyone will read this, but then again, that's the beauty of blogs...when someone finds it and publishes all the useful ideas here as a book, becomes a millionaire and then makes a tribute to the originators of the idea, which s/he will call an "inspiration"...man, finger's really tired....oh wells........  Linc excursion was absolutely amazing, astonishing, absolutely a morale raising thing, even with the social issues :D walked for a long time, took way too many photos, pissed a few people off, screamed really loudly, i dunno...seems a bit sad really, hahahaha, in fact, some of the "compliment"s i get aren't really compliments, more like patronizing comments, heheh...oh well, i'll make do.  We went to see lots of logs....and stuff.....that was the boring part...then after that we went to a park, where zong hao , raj , faruga (whahahahah) , ivan , han , me and others played a bit of Volleyball (but quickly lost interest) and even in the reasonably shoddy weather, we managed to have fun, then we moved on to soccer, and footy kicking, then we moved on the rock throwing, heapz fun! But the most funnest was Rugby!! :D :D :D absolutely fun, even though han smashed me in da face...hehe..i managed to injure a few people (Sorry Ivan ;) Hope you're alright! You "poor thing"...) , and few people started new fashion trends with torn shirts and such...well i totally love it! Maybe I'm a bit too rough though...  Anyway, after about 8 sausages, I went around walking barefoot on hard rock, and later, after a few dollar coin, a lake and a wish, we started on our way home(waiting for the bus to bring andrew, natha , alester and a few other peeps back from museum, where i'm sure they had a smashing time :D , and we went back to rossy..  The trip massively boring...what with Charli and Cheryl talking about cars, and me pretending to know something ( i know a bit i guess) and then backstreet boys and westlife, and after mister zong hao the generous gave out lollies and seaweed...or whatever that green sticky lumpy stuff was, hahaha, i tasted great actually, and chocolate (mud truffle!), we arrived, took a group photo, mr rennie is cool! he got me a good shot..and then my title comes into action,anyway, andrew decided to go and take photo's in school, so we did, first, to natthika (is that right? ) , then to random parts of the school, but we mainly got nessie kevin and raymond, only cos they were in the corridors ( andrew got one of ja, and he got a complimentary punch in the stomach, whahahhahahaha..soo evil) and then almost everybody else avoided the watchful eye of the camera....(click, click click ) well it seemed to Andrew that everybody was avoiding me, so he said something about everyone not liking me, and then relate that to this morning's issue? tadaa!! anyway, i didn't take it to seriously until after the lee twins refused to get their photo taken (i dunno..i wouldn't like photo's of me taken by some person i never heard of..hahahah) so i'm not really suprised, my brain just links that with some comment ago aobut me being obsessed with my camera, which i believe to be true..hahah....anyway, back home, andrew and me were checking out some photos when i hurt my self esteem more, or at least amplified the hurt of my self esteem, andrew was mocking some of my pictures (hahah...i belive they could have better, but i took it harshly anyway) and (then said "no offence" hahaha, sorry andrew, it's not your fault, i just bring things up myself, i don't really mind how crap my pictures are...however deleting my pictures... grr....) well, after that i was once again unsettled about how i should go about licking my wounds, whether i should overlook the lousy photos, the social life and the wonderful comments my brain makes to me whenever i hear something that really just pisses me off...or whether i should go psycho and chase it down until i beat it....like i did to a certain year 9 today..hee...not nice of me..i wasn't panting very hard suprisingly, but tommorow.....baang! he's dead...whahahaha....anyway, the first part is easy, the next two are very very hard.....oh man, i shouldn't be blogging, i should just post up a song and the lyrics *pronouced lhyie-rickhs not lricks ..oh watever ..* like jaja which explains the whole world...hehehe, anyway, thanks all you guys reading this and for being my friends , and man, you have no idea how much i appreciate it...even though it may not show ;) bye!

      I'm in the mood for a bit of reviewing of my current social life, of course, it's nothing you should be interested in, however, i am aware of the fact that i'm not a very socially active person, and that i'm actually quite bloody boring once i get out of school, like someone said "Marrying The Computer" is exactly what i do...well at least since i spend so much time on the computer i should be at least literate in it.. =D  Social lives....can't seem to think of a metric system in which i can measure it, just how often you get out of the house and go to shopping centres and hang around with your friends..doesn't make much sense to me really. But it's worth a try, i'll get a little gang together to go shopping.....and we'll go watch a movie...eat food....joke around...go home......big deal!  Hahahaha, oh well, no point being so disheartened, Woke Up This Morning....by Nickelback...interesting song, even though i'm not a aficionado towards Rock, i guess as long as it doesn't make give me headaches i'll be fine...NO i'm not a girl, all people can have headaches...i woke up really early this morning and i couldn't get u-know-who out of my head, so i just got up and prepared for the walk, which means by the time you read this i'll be back from school, and ready to reblog.. :D this is really addictive, i can say anything i want..hahaha  Well, it's beginning to brighten up, i should decide what to wear for now...NO I'm not a girl, just concerned about warmth, even though i got just about enough insulation. (whahahahhahaha)...how can i treat myself like this ..hehe...neways, have fun reading, and CYA ROUND!  Ben felt loved at 6:22..hehe....Nessie's blog is soo funny!

      Today was pretty good, I did a few things that I intended to do today, and i did a few things i shouldn't have done today as well....but anyway, it's all good, we all make our own mistakes, the importance is how often and big our mistakes are :} (Cute eh?)  Anywayz, I went to school at the usual 9 o clock , give or take a few minutes, and i reached class , which was Law and Commerce, which was where i wanted to be because i had a few words to say to Ja, however, as it turned out, i got torn in between two worlds, one good and evil (duh!) and so I never got round to thanking her or anything, I tried to catch her eye in the computer room, in which mrs..ms vicary had deposited us...to no obvious avail.As i was typing up goverential legislation (whoop dee doo!) I decided to try again, only to look straight into Rex's face...which really scared the defecation out of me, I'm sure he thinks i like Ja now.... :  Anyhoo, into English, and once again, Mrs Swain expected more than what she told us to do out of us :P hahahah, i didn't doo anything but, ahah....no biggie, i think she doesn't mind unless someone like er.....alison doesn't do it, even though ali is cool! ;) We read this western....amit was cracking jokes, and Jared was being his usual shy self (like Jaja said with undeniable affection "ooh...he's so shy! [ No I am not JEALOUS! ] ) Bryan was just being his usual cool self, and sean was beginning to pick up a sense of humour..whahahahhahaha  Into chinese, i tried to make myself laugh again, and as always, i succeed, the problem is...no one else laughs....... oh well, at least 1 person is happier, but then is said something really really bad..apparently, teacher was choosing someone to do quiz, and she just HAD to chose black shoes and black socks, which i automatically relate to Goths...so me being my usual happy obnoxious teenager, shouted out "Goth" there was a pause..i think even the teacher looked at me, and i'm sure Hannah's eyes almost popped out of her sockets glaring at me.....i'm really mean...Nessie was making some coughing sounds and derogatory remarks and later, after i managed to catch on, i apologized to Hannah...and bought chocolate as a token of my apology..i don't think it was enough, but I hope Hannah is not too pissed at me, I didnt mean it that way!  Onto lunch time,in the totally cool chess room, i had to stand for the whole 40 minutes cos the place was packed with people playing mental magic, paper cut yugioh duels, Type 1 style mtg tcg duels, arm wrestles, hat stealings, mini fights, take-me and last but not least chess. I had some dispute over stealing rays food and then giving him a chocolate then taking it back...heehee....but anyway, i'm sure ray's not pissed....or IS HE!? I spoke to Lisan, a really smart and cool girl (sharp and fierce though! scary.....) about her totally hating me, and she said she doesn't oh...doesn't that make you feel warm all over in this lousy winter weather?Actually it's kind of getting warmer, which is good...don't you think?  Ah...stories in the life of a boy, in class, i missed my usual staring ritual, during which i stare at someone i like alot and hope they look back...no hope..science was fun, i was playing around with some wires and flicking the on and off switch on the power pack most of the time,and you know what, we had a science test (in which my very optimum mark would be 7.5, but mr lyle was staring at my sheet, his mouth aghast, not believing nor comprehending what his eyes were showing him) , and i finished a bit early, and i turned the sheet around, and drew something about a million tonnes dropping from 102000 m from the sky and hitting Mr. Rose with energy value of about 1000000000 x 9.8 x 102000 and then i decided to harass him somemore by drawing his pants wet, an assasin with a chaingun firing at his stomach and shaking his head at his bad aiming, and him farting onto a mini olympic stick person, who happened to be a torch bearer...heheh...evil!!; but anyway, not much happening there....mathematics was a no hand raising time, and i had a load of FUN convincing Omar that there was a stain on his cheek..silly boy.  Volleyball training was a smash hit, literally, walked home, got home, ate dinner, talked to Hui, Andrew is bringing his camera for the bush walk tommorow!! YAY!!! anyway, it's all good, life goes on, a big chain of abstract goodies..heeeheeeheehehee.. I LOVE LINC!!  Hahaha....Meng Han got Chris in the nuts today..wonder if his jewels are still intact..hahahaha...so evil...   Sport is like a bank, if you don't have interest, you gain absolutely nothing.

      Tonight was a enlightening night for me...I found out how badly i react over the smallest things on the smallest days, and how unintelligently i argue, and how illogical i am, and all thanks to Ja. Today, as you might have already read, was not a good day for me, and i wasn't pleased when i sat down and tried to talk to Jaryllyn, only to recieve in return..not much at all, but truth is i was feeling down and i wanted to pass the love around, as dear Jaja said so, but as we began to talk about homework, ladida, somehow we managed to start talking about Vicary, and Jaryllyn said i suck up to her, which is probably true, well....i flared up at her, and not only did i not manage to hurt her, she managed to make me see how stupid i was being, she managed to calm me down enough so that i stopped blabbering about bull feces. However, the "argument" was not resolved because she had to go, and i just realized how much sense she really had...  I'm feeling really bad now, i realized that i flared up at her not because of her snide comments and her witty remarks, but because she wasn't angry, i was trying to make someone else hurt and that would me make me feel good, (:P i'm kind of evil)....so now i'm feeling ever so bad for her, and no i'm not wallowing in self pity as you might think i am, i am truthfully and most sincerely grateful to Jaryllyn. Ms Siow, if you're reading this, i just wanna thank you :) and if it were not for you, someother unfortunate person would have to undergo my impossibly annoying crazy depressed sad name calling phase, which happens every few months...kind of like menstruation. Soo........Thanks :D  Who Watches The Watchmen..?

      Have you ever felt that you weren't talking to your friends enough? Have you ever felt that if stop talking to them for a few days, that they are no longer you're friend? I sometimes feel like that. I haven't spoken to this person for a long time, and now that i realized, i feel a strong sense of , sadness. This person is smart, this person is a good speaker, a good listener, a great person to be around, but somehow i just can't bring myself to speaking to them. I don't know why, I keep feeling that they will somehow break away from my chain of friendship. The sky is the limit for what can happen due to lack of communication.  Today's math class was particularly good because i just discerned the matter of my intelligence and it's capacity to think. I am the most un-lateral, and un-logical thinker, what does that make me? First we had a quiz for some math week thingo, which involved us typing keys into a calculator, really really fast. I was the first to finish. I had one of the best marks but not good enough to get into the top. And the winner just so happened to be the one i adore so much but yet am scared to speak to..sometimes....she's smarter than me! Wow, i feel really lousy now! You know why? Because that makes me inferior, if she's smarter, better looking (in her own way) and more popular, then how can i have any guts to talk to her? Well, then we did graphical inequalities (hehe..i like these phrases) , and when asked how to find a line on a graph, i put my hand up, which is something i don't like to do in maths, due to the fact that i'm not too good at it.But anyway, i gave my answer , which was gradient. GRADIENT!! WHAT DA COW? How can you use a gradient to find a line, anyway, the teacher corrected me, saying the answer was something about two points, and once again, i feel red, red that i embarrassed myself in front of my crush (who doesn't even know i like her).  Then i come home, walking through the soggy wet oval, with another of my friend talking to me about some game that people use to entertain themselves and to prove that they are doing something instead of looking at porn, and when i got home, i slammed the door behind me, staggered into the kitchen, glanced at the handwritten white paper note sitting on the black glass table....and then put my shoes away, only to find that i had no space, and had to stack it on top of my sandals, and i found out that my shoes were all grime and no friction but theni realized it was too late, so i wandered off into my room, switched on my computer, painstakingly chose the Operating System, of which i had multiple versions installed due to my paranoia of crashes and damage, then sorted my room, relieved myself, came back, sat down, and started the discharge of my feelings into the net of fallaciousness.

       I am the most useless, slow writer when it comes to impromptu writing. I was in English class, trying to be smart again, when Mrs Swain picks me to speak about a some short lines about Poetic Analogies (sounds really cool eh?), and i chose this one  Love is a Blender, it mixes you up. Makes great things, breaks inconveniently. Messes up your life, but taste so good.  and i wrote   "I chose this one because I think that. The words analogy make the poem interesting and easily understandable. Most of the sentences are similai similiar in length and syllables. This is like a free verse poem. It has no rhyme yet it manages to catch your attention. There seems to be no "deeper meaning" in the poem. Just simply like a blender.  You know what i think of this rubbish? It's the product of a blender. My brain is like a bloody blender , it spins words in my head and then it spits out random Sh** and splats it all over the page. You know what? I should write about my mind being like a blender, from K-mart, which cost 14.99 and has a warantee of 15 days! Arrghh...and Amit and Hui, they just don't need to try, they're minds are like 489.00 custom made Japanese Brand Blender! Like sony or something....arghhh....oh well, that's the reason that i suck at english, because my brain, is a blender.

      No this is not about me cleaning up after my imaginary sister. Nor is it about me trying to learn from one who has mastered his or her particular skill by learning from their work. Actually it is. I was inspired to start this blog by my good friend Jaryllyn (did i spell that right?) who i'm sure is puckering up as she reads this poor excuse of a blog. I wanted to be different so chose a different template. GREAT! Now i'm special!! At this moment i'm feeling rather special because someone special smiled at me today and also because a certain friend of mine has revealed something that she has only revealed to 4 other people!! Wanna know who it is and what it was? Well..no I know that I am an awful secret keeper and anyone who's read this will never again disclose any piece of personal information to me. Anyway, back to the topic. Jaja's blogs are full of depressing statements, inspiring songs, delicious comments ( don't take it the wrong way!!) delightful quotes, alot of self criticism, and most importantly, a myriad of bombastic and er..special words,(or perhaps in singapore everyone uses words like "fusillades" and "mendacious". Anyway, hopefully you won't see any of that here. ( Too late mate.)     There is a certain special person that i have strong feelings for, and i am not the type of person that has been out with 50 people, or who goes to parties every 6 days, or who has a gaggle of friends in year 11. I am your regular...DORK. Yeh, i might be a bit bigger, for those who don't know i'm a bit taller than the majority or yr 10s (yes i am in year 10) and i'm not particularly pleased with that. But being a dork does have it's advantages (American Pie 2) uh huh. Anyway, I have always been the person who stays at home...types on the computers....goes out on odd days, doesn't have the bloody plasma TV, the friggin surround sound, the top of the range computer, the room as big as Rossmoyne Senior high School, or the console with the extremely addictive games. I'm the one with the computer in the room, who occasionally is forced to close the door when embarrassing things are happening, who gets mediocre marks by "sucking up" to the teachers. That is me, and once again, i'm not proud of it. I am the person who has fantasy's in which i am wandering vagrant skilled in swordsmanship, who goes around with my gang of 4 vanquishing people from the face of earth in stylish efficacy. I try not to wear a mask of joy or delight wherever i go, however, somethings are inevitable.  I have once been called BFG, which can be translated into many things, both uncivil and courteous. I like to translate it as Boy Following Ghost. I am a chaser of things not to be and things not to come, and in creating a blog, i have moved 1 step into reality , 1 step closer to man
