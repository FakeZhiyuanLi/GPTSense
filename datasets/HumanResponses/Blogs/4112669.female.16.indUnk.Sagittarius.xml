      I had my first crazy customer. When I saw first saw him walking towards the store, I suspected he was slightly unbalanced. He was a short, chubby man wearing a white baseball cap wider than the door and what seemed to be womens sweatpants pulled up to his ribs. He was littered in cheap gold jewelry and had WHISKERS, four or five hairs that were groomed to stick out at the corner of his mouth. But I had seen oddly dressed customers before, so I was only slightly perturbed. He came in, walked up to the counter, and without a word, leaner over the counter to see what I was looking at on the computer. Now keep in mind that the counter is fairly wide so a man of his petite frame would have to almost have to hoist himself onto the counter and balance horizantly with his feet dangling in midair to see the screen. This wasn't a lighthearted joke or a cheerful curiosity either, he scowled the entire time. I recoiled and he returned to his side of the counter and muttered his phone number and gave me his tickets. A lot of customers lose their tickets or give me only 1 or 2 when they have 3 or 4 orders in store and most of them expect me to get all of the orders. He gave me 3 tickets but he had 4 orders. The fourth order was just a suit so I got all four, expecting he wanted all of them. As I put the fourth order down, he exploded. What did I think I was doing! I wasn't given that ticket! I better put it back now! I apologized and put it back in the rack. When I came back to the counter I found him milling around in the storage section, a section very much behind the counter and obviously for employees only. When he saw me staring he shuffled back in front of the counter and yelled "OK!" as if I had just scolded him. I gave him the total which was 20.65 and he was shocked. Apparently he was only going to spend the twenty dollars in his hand, nothing more nothing less. He asked me if I was trying to trick him using "some kinda math mumbo jumbo". I said no. He told me I was wrong, that I couldn't add, that I didn't know what I was talking about. I calmly explained that our store is run on a computer, that the computer does all the calculations, that I wasn't trying to cheat him out of 65 cents with my sly Algebra 2 skills. While the customer behind him carrying 27 shirts, 4 suits, and 8 pants was trying to keep breathing, he demanded a paper and a pencil and all of the tickets of his clothes. That meant I had to give the employee copies as well, so six altogether. He took all six, first taking two minutes to line them up straight, then set to work. After ten minutes of adding and readding his total, and just as the woman behind him was collapsing, he asked me brightly, "What was the total again?". I repeated it, and he exclaimed happily. "Oh! Ok!", and smiled at me like we had been bosum buddies forever. He walked out of there, no problem, but once out the door, heavily debated going left or right. Left won out and he trotted away. Two seconds later he changed his mind and ran at a surprising speed right and knocked into my open door. Unfazed, he picked himself up and sped up again. Run, Forrest! Run!

      A couple of friends and I are having a garage sale on sunday from 8-5, or if nobody comes, 8-3. It's on 3 Princess Drive in North Brunswick, NJ. There will be at least 2 computers for sale, probably some bikes and rollerblades, and lots of Babysittters Club and Sweet Valley High in my spread. There will also be a haggling booth where you'll have to battle with the loudest, meanest, isn't afraid to hittest woman-demon alive, or as we like to call her   THE   HAGGLIMINATOR,     or you know, janki.

      I...cannot...stop...blogging. I've lost my blog virginity and now I'm a complete blogspot nympho, or slogger (slut + blogger). Well I can't help it. I'm at work and there is nothing to do except count my toes and sigh. Oh, or get hurt! I already: knocked my elbow senseless, dropped a stapler on my toe, cut my finger on a safety pin, tripped over my foot. Dry cleaners should be red terror zones.

      This is going to be a secret blog. I'm not going to tell anyone, are you?  Edit: But whoever leaves the first comment will get a present. A pledge of undying internet friendship? No, something substantial. Something you can hold, something that will lull you to sleep, bring wisdom and joy into your life by its mere presence. Or something that tastes good, like a frozen hot pocket or whatever.

      Aries Spears from Mad Tv used to go to my school. "What an asshole" - Mr. Lupo. I heard he got in a lot of fights and tried too hard and was a jerk and everybody hated him. But now he's famous, so I'm going to hit on him this friday night at the Stress Factory. Who's with me?

      Dear Blogger Incorporated:           You are ass.  Why can't I log in? Why does it take me 11 tries to be accepted? My caps is off, my username and password are right, why do you try me like this? Do you just hate me blogger? Am I tainted? Did I sleep with your husband? Did I talk behind your back? Did I call you a whore? Whatever it is, blogger, please forgive me and let me back in your heart*.  *website
