Now that this week is over I have 8 weeks left to go and can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The hooding ceremony is August 12th at 6:00 PM and the graduation ceremony is August 13th starting at 9:00 AM and ending by 11:30 AM.

      Last week I took an interterm statistics course titled The Art and Science of Poker. It was a pretty fun class and I learned a little bit, although I would really have liked to get into some of the more advanced topics but I guess I can't complain about getting four elective credits for learning about poker.  The course had two different books. The first book was  urlLink Winning Poker For The Serious Player  by Edward Silberstang. This book is a pretty good basic book that incorporates some basic strategy although doesn't really address any strategies beyond basic good starting hands for the different games. The second book was  urlLink The Theory of Poker  by David Sklansky. This is a really good book and apparently is considered a must read by many poker players. The book addresses many concepts and strategies which I found very interesting. My one complaint with the book is that the examples are poor in many cases and must be read multiple times.  Anyway I enjoyed the class and I'm looking forward to playing some more poker.

      This past Saturday my girlfriend Lauren, a friend from work and I hiked  urlLink Quandary Peak .  urlLink Quandary Peak  is a fourteener(14,000+ feet elevation) about 8 miles south of Breckenridge with a peak elevation of 14,265 feet. This was my first fourteener and I definitely underestimated the 6.25 mile round trip hike with an elevation gain of 3,450 feet, but the important thing is I did make it to the summit. We left the car at about 9:00 in the morning and made it back to the trailhead at about 3:30 in the afternoon. It was really fun and aside from nursing my sunburn I'm pretty much recovered from the event and looking forward to hopefully hiking another this summer. Below are some pictures from the hike, you can click on them to enlarge them.   urlLink    Blue Lake on the way up.    urlLink    Approximately the last 1,000 vertical feet.    urlLink    Lauren and I at about 13,800 feet.    urlLink    Looking southwest from the summit at 14,265'    urlLink    One of a pair of mountain goats ahead of us on the trail as we descended.

      I have been reading a few postings on a friend from works blog and it seems like a good way to share some thoughts and experiences, so I figured that I would give it a shot. My main goal for this blog is to share what is going on in my life with friends and family. I'm planning for my first post with real content to be about hiking my first 14er this past weekend which should be posted soon.

      It's been a little while since I put anything out here so here is an update. Recently I've taken two road trips once home to Minnesota for the Fourth of July and this last weekend to my girlfriends home town of Saint Louis. Going home for the fourth was nice. I never realized how much I like the lakes until I left. It's just a shame they don't have lots of water and foliage by the mountains. It would make the perfect place to live. Anyway I was able to get home and enjoy sometime on the lake as well as trade in my car with my Uncle Kevin. The Expedition was getting up there in miles and I traded it in for a newer Explorer.     The trip to Saint Louis was fun as well. I had never been there and it's always interesting to see new places. I was able to attend a Cardinals game and although they lost I did see Barry Bonds hit a homerun. It really was amazing to watch, I think that he only swung at two pitches in the first 8 innings and hit one of them out of the park. It's totally different in person. He did have a couple four pitch walks to go along with that homerun too so I guess that it was a good day for him. Aside from that I was able to see some of the town, the arch and the waterfront. They had a summer festival to commemorate the 1904 Worlds Fair and the 1804 discovery by Lewis and Clark so we were able to see a water show and fireworks one of the nights.     It was also nice to be able to stop off and see my cousin Paige in Holts Summit on the way to Saint Louis. Paige has recently been diagnosed with cancer and I really appreciated having some time to spend with her. I wish her all the luck in the world in her battle with cancer and she continues to be in my prayers.

       urlLink    I was able to get up fishing on the  urlLink Poudre  river for a little while last Saturday morning. Unfortunately I didn't catch anything and there were no bugs coming off the river at all. I was fishing a stimulator with a nymph dropper and the fish wanted nothing to do with it, but it was still fun to get out on the river.
