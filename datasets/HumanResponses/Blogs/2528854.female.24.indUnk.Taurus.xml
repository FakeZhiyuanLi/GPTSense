      I recently find myself looking for the perfect blog. Already the proud owner of www.michelle.withever.org, I supposed I want to engulf my attention with problems much less significant than those I have been struggling with (bills, ex boyfriends, voices in my head.... typical stuff). This, therefore is a continuance of my search. Surely, this will suffice and end my blog sufferings. Yes, I believe it will.... and don't call me shirley.

      It is finished. The trip to Nasville, Franklin to be exact, was interesting and fulfilling. My raw voice over the music sounded almost as good as something you would hear on the radio. I can only imagine and squirm with delight at the thought of how it will sound once completely finished. Maybe some years from now I will read this, along with everyone else, and laugh at the beginning of my new musical career. Let us pray....

      The road to making a demo cd is gruelsome. Does anything ever happen when you want it to? no. Does anything ever come easily? no. When it is convenient for you to make this cd of which you speak.. do you have your voice? no. Of course it is a lesson in the world where murphy's law is always triumphant. If it can happen, it will. This is yet another lesson that I did not want to learn.

      Alas, I believe that there must've been some reason for the end of the PERFECT michelle blog. I do miss the sixty something entries that I had saved up, and I do miss the wittiness that was mine which will forever be forgotten in webspace. I am still a little veclempt at the thought of never retrieving my innermost thoughts from the past year, but I figure I'll get by with my new thoughts. The reason I have come to terms with the loss of my beloved weblog is that I figure only positive things can come of this. I will have erased all the negativity that has haunted me over the past year, and this symbolizes the cleansing of my soul. I have come out of therapy clean and now, my weblog is also clean.... free from the horrible shit that has passed through my life. Well, here is the beginning, I suppose. Wish me luck.

      I'm pissed. First of all, my main blog has been forsaken by the old server and a friend of mine. She has taken a new server and left me in the dark with some sixty blog entries floating around in space.... with no backup. Here I am using a backup blog to vent on something that I should be using the blog that all my friends read for... pisser. And not to mention that some questionnaire got published twice on my blog and I have deleted and deleted and to no avail. The questionnaire is still on my blog. Twice. Every freaking time. okay... venting over.. off to find new main blog.....

      For Amber's benefit, I do not think the kid at work is cute, anymore...... I was having a lonely day. But, there is a very attractive man coming into town this weekend to see me. So, I'm not feeling quite so desperate. I am very excited that Natalie is bringing her new boyfriend, and I am also very excited that Billy Wayne is coming to see ME. Natalie said he was actually GUSHING about me after he met me this past weekend. He loves that I'm opinionated and aggressive (fucking A), he thinks I'm soooo hot (Thank God for the BLIND), and he's already called me to tell me how excited he is about coming in and hanging out with me. Wow.... I may actually make out with someone for the first time in lots of months. Super. That is all for today. NO MORE DESPERATE MICHELLE!!!!!

      I'm getting so desperate. I'm horny, I'm lonely, and I can't find a man. I actually find myself thinking that one of the kids at work is cute. What is wrong with me!!!!!!?? I am having serious problems. I don't need a man to make my life complete, but it's getting hard to tell myself that and feel good about it. I'm 24 and need to get laid. I'm open to suggestions.. but since no one reads this, I guess I'm just bitching to myself. Damn. Someone help me.

      This is a post from my other blog (which I obviously put more time into). I thought enough of it to post it here, plus the new templates for blogger are pretty :) read, enjoy, and comment if you'd like.    I just finished reading  Lies and the Lying Liars who Tell Them  by Al Franken. I, being a Liberal, of course thought this book was hilarious. But, I would rather myself be considered a fair liberal, and therefore I decided to study up on some of this stuff myself. I first read some of Ann Coulter's columns. I thought Al was surely kidding about what a nut this woman is, but alas, he is not. I have two things to say to Ann Coulter. First, go back to school and learn how to get facts straight. Secondly, if you would spend as much of your time and energy educating Republicans on politics as you do on talking about how horrible and ignorant Liberals are, maybe your life would be a little better spent. I am not a fan of most conservatives, but I must tell you this is only because they don't respect my beliefs and galavant around the world beating people over the head saying "Liberals are BAD!!!". I just wish that people had the balls to improve their own party without just lashing out at each other. It's ridiculous. Campaigning, mud slinging... it's all ridiculous. It seems as though you can only run for office or write a political column if your resume includes name-calling. Stop the insanity!!! Improve our Country!!!! (and let's get George Bush out of the White House, mmmkay?) that is all ;)   urlLink Ann Coulter is Crazy

      Well, that last post was about a month ago and a bit premature on the excitement, I suppose. I have since seen Billy Wayne, gone to murfreesboro to see him twice and the second time, he completely ignored me. It was a horrible trip during which I spent one night with him and then went to get ready at my friend's house. After that, I couldn't get a hold of him all day. I was supposed to spend the night with him again that night, but I guess that's too much to ask of someone when you drive an hour and a half to see them. Maybe. Whatever, I'll just go back to my normal lonely, keep-to-myself person and maybe get into another band or something to occupy my time. Don't feel sorry for me, I know better than to date these guys. This is my fault, these are my mistakes, this is my life.
