      I just get so f*@king irritated sometimes.  There is this one girl at my work.  She's in her early 20's and naive as all get out.  She is so damn happy all the damn time and talking to her is like talking to a 9 year old on crack. Half the time I just stare at her with my head cocked to the side, kind of like my dog does when she thinks she's smarter than me.    Perhaps I'm jealous. I wish I could live in a happy little bubble, and forget about real things like bills and problems and evil exes. I can't figure out how this girl makes it through life. She couldn't find her way out of a paper bag even if she had a pair of scissors.  And why, oh WHY is it acceptable for stupid people to remain stupid.  We have quite a few people at work who have been demoted because they are too freaking stupid to do the job they were hired to do.  I had this guy working under me when I was supervisor of data entry.(Did I mention i work at a title research company?) I ended up with him in my department because he started out as an examiner but was making too many mistakes and they decided that wasn't acceptable. They felt bad firing him because he was in chorus with the boss's son, so they gave him to me. He didn't do data entry.  He filed papers.  He was a 44 year old file clerk. And he couldn't do that right. Finally he quit. But that was after I was no longer supervisor of that department. He left to sell shoes part time at Dillard's and "pursue his singing career."  Right.  The new supervisor of that department is a rockhead too. 35 or 36 years old?  I dunno.  Anyway, we had a some pretty strong storms roll through here on Monday evening. Knocked the power out. So I came back to work to reset all the servers and make sure everything was running for the AM. As I was restarting my servers, my boyfriend, was patiently waiting for me to finish so we could go get chicken wings. (Our power was still out at home, and Monday is $.25 wing night at the Pelican.) To give him something to do, I asked him to go around and turn on everyone's computers.    He cocked his head and looked at me kinda funny.   I said, "You don't understand. The people that work here are stupid. If they come in and their monitor is black, they won't know what to do."  With his head still cocked, he asks "They won't know to turn on the computer?"  "No."  Shaking his head, he walked away to turn on the 30-some computers we have.   The next day, sure as shit, rockead data entry supervisor valley girl walks into my office.  "Ummm, my screen is black and my phone looks funny."  He must have missed hers.  "Yes, the power went out last night.  It probably reset the display on your phone when it came back on. And your computer will need to be restarted."    "Oh. OK. Well, how do I do that?"  I cocked my head.  "There is a power button on the front of your computer.  You push it."  Blank stare.    Forget it!!!!  Don't bother explaining, just do it for her. Pushed the button on the front of the machine, reset her phone display, walked away.  Not EVEN five minutes later...  "Ummmm, the monitor at the scanner is broken too."  "It's not broken.  It's turned off.  When the power went out it turned off."  "Ok. I'll go use the other one."  OMG.  Turn the fucking thing on!!!!  WTF do you do when your TV screen is black?  Call the TV repairman?

      So I suppose I should know, and I guess I kind of understand this whole blogging thing now.  You pretty much just ramble on about whatever comes to mind.  I do that all the time to just about everyone I talk too, so maybe this will be beneficial...

      I cry over everything.  I am not one of those strong people who can act tough and hold in my emotions.  So I just had to tell my boss that I have to leave early to put my kitty to sleep.  Via email, and I still cried.  So then the president of the company comes in to tell me she's sorry to hear about my kitty and I can barely mutter "it's ok, he's old" without breaking down.  So I think I'm going to take a few minute break.  Go outside and clear my head.  Not that I'm very useful right now anyway.  I can't concentrate.  And I am worried how I'm going to get him to the vet because I just moved a few months ago and can't remember where the door for his little crate is.  Guess I could wrap him in a blanket.  But I don't think he'd stay still.  What a crappy day.

      So my cat is dying I think.  I know that's not a very pleasant thought.  He's old.  He'll be 16 in August.  I've had him since I was 12.  Guess it's time to let him go.  I had his sister put down a few months ago.  I just feel guilty, what if I am making the wrong decision?  Or what if I already have because I've waited too long?  I don't think he's in pain.  He's not meowing any more than normal.  But he's not eating.  I bought him stinky ocean fish flavored soft cat food.  He ate a little bit of that.  And he has a lump on his chest, I guess you would say in his armpit?  It moves.    I don't want to take him to the vet for tests. He's so old I don't think I'd have him treated and prolong suffering.  I guess I'll just give it a day or so more, see if he eats any better, and then take him in.  Actually I'll have my boyfriend do it, so I don't wreck on the way home from sobbing so hard. He's not very attached to him.  (Actually I know he'll be relieved when it's finally done. His not a big fan of cats, but he's being nice and not saying that to me right now.)  I don't know. Maybe something will have changed by the time I get home....

      My company is stupid sometimes.  They are so bent on everyone having titles here.  Forget the fact that what most of us are paid isn't much above poverty level, a title makes it ALL better.    But what's REALLY stupid is that it doesn't matter what your title is, you're going to have to do shit that has absolutely nothing to do with it. Now, I am not saying that I am above certain things, but when I am asked to do something that I have NO FREAKING clue how to do, and the person telling me how to do it is the person that is supposed to be doing it, I get pissed off.  Now, you don't know much about what we do here, so I'll give the readers digest version. We are a title research company. We search in the entire state for liens, bankruptcies, foreclosures, etc.  Our clients are title companies, attorneys and banks.  I started here in data entry. I had absolutely no clue what this business was about, and I'm completely serious when I say I was probably here for at least 6 months before I had an idea. (But remember, I can wear JEANS) I still don't fully understand every aspect of it. But that's ok.  Because I am now their "Network Administrator".  Now, I would prefer to not have that title.  That title gives the impression to many that I have some sort of Computer Science degree and that I am well educated in the workings of the computer world.  Well, I don't and I'm not.  What I do have is the ability to pick things up quickly with my technical mind (unusual for many females I am told). And I like computers.  That's it. And my boss figured that out one day after I explained how to do certain calculations in a spreadsheet he was trying to create.  So how the hell did I end up with this title? Back when I was still a data entry peon, and our boss was out of town, one of our servers crashed. The entire office went into a panic. The office manager called the boss. She couldn't explain what was going on other than we couldn't get into "Program X". She went into the server room and told him that it was stuck. Oh dear lord, what will we do?  We can't work, our families will starve, the earth will spin off its axis. She continued to panic. So the boss decided she couldn't handle the pressure of dealing with such a catastrophic situation and told her that she would have to let me into the server room.    *GASP* Are you sure????  There are computers in there!  She may touch one!  Nobody goes in the server room.  It's off limits.    I'm serious. They're funny about stuff here. It's all a control issue. Anyway, long story short, I went in there, rebooted the damn machine, logged in after he reluctantly gave me the adminstrative password, restarted the server and the client, and saved the freaking world. After that I became "Assistant Network Administrator". Now it's my full time job.  That is why I get so freaking pissed when I have to do things that aren't within that realm. As I said, I'm not fully trained in this arena. I know bits and pieces about tons of stuff, but sometimes it takes some real brain power to figure out why the hell the fax server stopped printing or where the hell our emails are going because they aren't going where they should.  So yesterday, I was told by a person in another department, the department that handles incoming client requests, to contact a client because they ordered the wrong type of search. I was like WTF? That's you're fucking job. Ok fine. Sent her an email (because you know people like us hate to talk on the phone). Told the client to order X search instead of Y search for the reason the director of operations and president had to explain to me because I didn't know nor did I care what was wrong with the way she ordered it in the first place. But I kind of had this nagging feeling that what they told me was wrong. I tried to counter with my opinion, but due to my lack of knowledge in the area of searches, my opinion was dismissed. And I got no response from the client. I figured she understood. So today the same person that dragged me into this in the first place told me that the client was still ordering the wrong search and I should contact them again. WTF??? So I did. And I got the response I expected. What I told her was wrong, her boss told her to order the Y search and the reason she gave me was indeed valid. Now I look like the asshole. Fuck it. Forwarded the email back to the director of ops and said you take it from here.    Let me know when the client can't place an order through the web site.  That I can handle.

      I was late for work today. This isn't really a surprise. I can never get out of bed on time. I would have been on time today, except for the fact that I got a few miles from my house and started to wonder if I closed the sliding door after I let the dog in. I have forgotten to do that before and have come home from work to find the door wide open for all the world to get in. One time I left the garage door open, with the Harley and the side door unlocked. I leave the bathroom light over the shower on all the time. I even left a frozen pizza in the oven, went out to wash my car, and came back in about an hour later wondering what that smell was.  So I tried to replay the events of the morning in my head. Maybe it's because I only get up about 20 minutes before I leave, but I couldn't remember for the life of me if I shut that door or not. So I turned around and went back. The door was shut.   Then I start wondering what my problem is.  Why do I always forget what I did in the morning?  Is it because it's so routine it just isn't a big enough event to be worth remembering?   All I know is that there have been many times at my old house when I would if I shut the garage door, so I'd go back. It would be shut, so I would leave. Then I would wonder if i locked the back door, so i'd go back again. Then, did I put the dog downstairs, shut off the kitchen light, IS THE OVEN STILL ON FROM LAST NIGHT??? Even if I didn't cook anything, which I would have to think about really hard to remember if I did cook or not. (most likely not).  But I'm not kidding. I have turned around and gone back home 3 or 4 times before. A doctor a few years ago half-assed diagnosed me as being obsessive-compulsive and slightly depressed. He tried to put me on Zoloft. I didn't take it. Then my mom sent me to a shrink. (obviously there was a lot more going on here than wondering if i locked my door or not). Anyway, she decided that I was a high strung person (you think?), highly stressed, and I should listen to relaxation tapes. Whatever. I tried that. I would just fall asleep.   So I guess I will just have to accept the fact that I will never remember if I locked the door or turned of the light and just keep turning around to go back and look. I don't think I'm really obsessive compulsive. I think I just know I forget to do things and can't remember if I forgot or not.  At least I never leave the house with no clothes on.    I think....

      Some days, I just can't wait to get the freak out of work. Ok, most days. But today is worse than usual. I have nothing to do. Nothing of great importance anyway. I'm sure I could come up with little mind-numbing piddly busy-work kinds of things to do, like alphabetizing our software or re-coiling extra network cables, but I can only do things like that for so long. I've been deleting old email addresses from our client web site. Look up the client, see if their active, if not, deactivate them on the web. Whee.  I could be doing so many things at home. The garage is so unorganized now it makes me cringe each time I walk in there. I could shampoo the carpet, even though the dog's leaking situation still isn't fully under control. (I adjusted her medication yesterday, I have to give it about a week). Speaking of the dog, I could give her a bath. I could be cooking a fabulous meal for my live-in to enjoy when he gets home from work. (ok, that's a stretch - but I could at least try). I could start filling my scrap book that I bought at least a month ago. Live-in likes the grass all nice and neat, I could mow that.   These are the things I would do if I didn't have to sit here on my ass all day long, bored out of my skull. Worst part is, unless one of the technologically challenged individuals here downloads a virus or installs a hotbar for me to remove, I won't have anything to do until Tuesday, when my boss returns with more not-so-exciting projects for me to put off until the next time he goes on vacation.  I know. I should find another job. I thought that for a while. But then I remembered how I just LOVED my last job when I started there, and how OH MY GOSH I could work here forever, and I just LOVE my boss and blah, blah, blah. Nope. Changing jobs won't help. You know why I took this job? Because I could wear jeans. Yep. That's what sold me at the interview, that's why I took such a pay cut to come here. Jeans. How cool to work in an office and be able to wear JEANS every day! Now I don't really care. So I know if I leave here, in 3 more years (seems to be my limit), I will be bored and ready to move on. Might as well stay bored here than take another pay cut.  I can't help it. I am not career oriented. I work because I have to. People will say, "Oh, but you'd be so BORED if you didn't work." Bullshit. I would find things to do. I would start by doing all the things I don't do now. Because now, by the time I get home from work, I don't feel like it. All the things I think about on my way to work that sound like such a good idea at the time, but take too much of my precious time by the time I finally get home that I don't want to waste time on them.   Does that make any freaking sense at all????  I don't want to waste time doing things I want to do because I don't have a lot of time to do them? So I sit my ass on the couch, watch TV, have sex if I'm lucky, fall asleep, and start all over again the next day.  At least I'm getting sex....

      I bruise like a peach. I have never seen anyone that bruises as easily as I do.  I currently have 4 bruises on my right leg and 1 on my left.  That is about the average for me. My boyfriend thinks there is something wrong with me and I should go to the doctor. But I know I am just a clutz. Two came from getting out of my jeep.  I need nerf bars or something.  Two are from when he bounced me off the teeter totter.  His daughter landed under me and was fine.  So I only have one that is unaccounted for.  I probably walked into something and just don't remember.   I remember last year for my friend's birthday we did jello wrestling. My knees were completely purple for 2 weeks. My friends were all pretty much fine.  I look like someone beat me.

      Mondays really stink. Especially chilly, rainy Mondays in June. Where is the nice weather? I've waited all winter and spring for hot, steamy, sweaty weather. And here I sit with pants and long sleeves on. Of course, it could be sunny out by now. I wouldn't know since my office has no windows. But I'm sure fluorescent lighting is good for the mood. About as good as Mondays.

      I just got an email with a link to photos from my 10th high school reunion. I didn't go. As I looked through the pictures, I was feeling little pangs, kind of like I used to get when I was actually in high school. Based on the photographs, the same little cliques either still exist, or reformed at this function. I saw the same girls who were not so nice to me smiling together as if they ruled the world. I saw the same girls who befriended me during those 4 years sitting in the back, either alone or only with their spouse/significant other, just like we used to do. Only I wasn't there this time to feel that I wasn't accepted. I saw the guys I used to be friends with talking to each other, hanging back near the doorway. I saw the guys I wasn't friends with out on the dance floor making fools of themselves just like they used to, and everyone smiling and clapping for them. One thing that made me smile: a lot of those girls that didn't like me are a little plump now.   So why do I feel like I missed something?    The next day was a family picnic. All the happy mommies and daddies were there smiling, letting junior eat sand, slide down the slide, grab food off their plates while sitting in their laps. They were all probably comparing the other tots to theirs in their heads, and thinking how their little one was so much more well-behaved, or cuter or prettier than the others. There were others there with no children, and based on the photgraphs, that kind of split the picnic into two groups. Those with child and those without. I of course, would have been in the without group.   Which is fine by me.  I remember going to school dances, nervously walking into the building, only to see all of the popular girls in a big circle outside the gym. I hated walking past them. Once inside I would squint in the darkness and search for my small group of friends. Finally I would find them, and we would dance the night away. I didn't care at that point that those girls left tacks on my seat, or knocked my books out of my hands in the hallway. But by Monday morning, I would feel the same. Hoping my best friend would not have an orthodontist appointment so I would be able to sit with her at lunch.  And lunch. What a group of misfits we were at that lunch table. We were all the wannabe's. Wannabe jocks, cheerleaders, skaters, punks, even nerds.  Yes, there was even a group of nerds we weren't quite nerdy enough to make it into. But man did we have fun. But I noticed that half of my original lunch table didn't make it to the reunion. They might have felt the same apprehension about attending as I did. And it's sad but I don't talk to most of those people at all anymore, unless I run into them somewhere. I'm horrible at keeping in touch with people.  Maybe I'll make it to the 15th. Depends on how much courage I can grow by then.

      I am a whiny, needy, bitch sometimes. The blog didn't help. I had to call. With the pathetic "are you still mad?" question. And of course he says what he always says. He wasn't mad, (he sure seemed mad) but he didn't like some of the stuff I said. Well, I wouldn't have either. I was defensive and mean. Of course, he said some things that hurt me a little too. Probably for the same reason.  But is the phone call enough? Not in my insecure little world. So I text message. Are you sure we're ok? Yes we're ok.   Do I feel better now?  A little. I feel annoying and childish, but I feel better.  I hate myself sometimes. I wish I could just turn it off. Once my brain kicks into high gear, look out. There has to be a better way for me to handle myself when I get like this.  But I don't know of one.

      Do you ever do something stupid that you know is going to cause a problem, yet you keep doing it? I do. I don't know what my deal is sometimes. It's like I get upset about something, and can't just leave well enough alone, and the next thing I know I've caused an argument and I'm muttering to myself what a freaking idiot I am.   I did that last night. And the worst part is, I couldn't even do it at a rational hour. Oh no, I have to wait until after midnight to show someone how ridiculous I can be. And now it's taking all I have to not call and say "Hey, I'm sorry I'm an asshole, please forgive me. Again." Becaue men don't want to hear you say that. They want to forget about the whole thing, like it never happened. Just like they don't want to hear about your problem in the first place, because the problem is you, not them, and why the hell can't you just get over it? So I'm hoping if I blog about it, it will make me feel better and I can just get over it and move on like nothing happened.  Last night the ex called. Not mine, but his. Fortunately I am not tied to mine with children so I never have to deal with that fucker again. Not so fortunate with her. And she can't call and be nice. She has to call and freak out. (More irrational than I am, believe it or not) She's upset because she doesn't have enough money to buy their youngest whatever she wanted for her birthday and to have a good birthday party. Quite frankly, I don't know what the woman does with her money. Between her paychecks, the child support and alimony, she really shouldn't be that broke. But based on the debts I'm told they had when they were married, apparently her spending habits have not changed.  I could handle the phone calls if she would only call about normal things to do with the children. But every damn time it's her freaking out about money. She never seemed too upset that the marriage ended, but sure does miss her meal ticket. So then he feels bad because he really thinks the poor kid isn't going to have a good birthday from her. So I said, "well, then give her money to get her something." (course, he'd have to wait until payday, because contrary to her belief, we aren't exactly living high on the hog.) He says, "I KNEW you were going to say that." Well, what do you want me to say? I wasn't trying be a snot, I was saying if she really doesn't have the money (which I DON'T believe) he can't let her not get the girl anything for her birthday.   Well then it turns into a discussion about alimony, taxes, and his pension (which she will be entitled to half of). That has always burned me.  I didn't get shit when my husband left me. I actually had to pay him $5000 and pay off his stupid jap-bike loan. He kept the bike. Of course, he was a bit of a loser, and my money did buy our property and put the downpayment on the house I kept... But I digress.  All night, I am thinking about this in the back of my head. And as I have indicated before, if there is something stuck in my head, I can't get it out no matter what I try. Which can affect my performance at work. And in the bedroom. So this is when all hell breaks loose. I will spare details, but basically, I just needed a little more to get my motor running than just a couple quick kisses. This turns into him asking what's wrong. Oh shit. He doesn't really want to know. And I really don't want to say. So after the 50 hundredth time of him asking I finally tell him I'm upset about that. He doesn't believe me and says there must be something else because that shouldn't keep me from getting... uh... you know... But no. That's honestly it. He says just forget about it. Hey thanks, I hadn't thought of that. Hello!!!!! If I could just quit thinking about it we wouldn't have a problem here. I think he thinks I was using that as an excuse to not have sex. I was not. I would have been fine, I just needed a little more,  *ahem*,  attention, before the train could roll into the tunnel, ya know? So why didn't I say so? Good question. Because with all I was thinking, that was part of it, and it was right on the tip of my tongue, and I couldn't. I couldn't express what I needed. As if what I needed was not important enough and I felt I should just be raring to go everytime and as quickly as he is.   A lot of ladies out there understand this I am sure. There are times when I can hardly get my clothes off in time without feelin like I'm going to explode. But sometimes, PARTICULARLY when something is bothering me, I can't FOCUS. And if I can't focus, I ain't gonna get the juices flowing. I swear I'm not making this shit up. And I've done enough reading about the subject to know that I am not alone.   Well, then it turns into how we don't have sex enough, and so I'm starting to panic about him not being happy in the relationship, and then I get really stupid and say shit like "good like finding a girl who's gonna give it up 3 times a day." I try to go sleep on the couch so I'll just leave him the fuck alone because I know I won't quit spewing at the mouth and he stomps out and tells me to get in bed and go to sleep. I can't fucking sleep now. I'm wide awake. Arguing does that too me. (it also aroused me - but I believe that is just because of the stress, faster heartbeat, increase in blood flow...) So then I leave to calm down and come back and he's asleep. I wanted so badly to wake him up and talk. But I didn't. That's the last thing he wanted. And I knew I had kept him up too late already. So now it's all left hanging and I don't understand how I could have possibly screwed up this bad when all I had to say was, "just do this for a little while".   I am an asshole. Maybe someday I'll learn not to do shit like that. Hopefully before it's too late.

      Ramble On.... Well, I hope everyone had a nice holiday. My weekend started out nicely, kinda sucked for a while at the end, but then got better again. Friday we had an unhealthy greasy dinner at the bar. Yummy! Then went to the Rally. It's this thing they do in town where a band comes in and plays and you have to buy tickets to get expensive beer. The bands aren't always that good, or the sound isn't, but it's nice to be outside and run into people you don't always see.   Saturday was a poker run. It took us all over - more than 100 miles. Pig roast at the last stop. Of course I didn't win, but I never win anything. I discovered that day how badly some of the women in our group of friends get of my nerves. One lady who has just started hanging with us, was really obnoxious. She has an annoying, screechy voice anyway, and when she drinks, it just gets worse. She's kind of a dingbat, I don't know if she did a lot of drugs or what but she just seems spaced out a lot of the time. 42 years old (we know because we went to her birthday party where her 18 year old got trashed on BV and puked all over the yard. Good mom). Anywho, she's 42, about 85 pounds, pock-faced, stretch-marked and partying like a, well, 18-year old whose mother lets her drink. We leave the 3rd stop, and by now she is pretty toasted. So she's walking out and the pizza place next door has a sign out on the sidewalk. She proceeds to trip on the sign, fall down on the sidewalk, and break the sign. She gets up and runs out into the street with her arms up shouting something like "Woo hoo! Did you see that? That was me!" Then she takes of her shirt to reveal her gold bikini top, and the stretchmarks on her tanless skin. Ick.   Now, I'm sure everyone is thinking I'm a real bitch. Normally I am not this mean about people's appearances (I know I'm no prize either), but this woman rubbed me the wrong way this weekend.   She started hanging around us after one of our other friends met her in another bar and invited her to hang out with us. This girl has a tendency to do that, she's kind of too nice sometimes. So like a lost puppy this woman starts hanging around, and I see her sizing up all the guys in the group. She decides to lock her sights on Big M and S. Big M is the sweetest, nicest, most caring and sensitive man. Almost to the point of being gay, but after a night of drunkeness I discovered he is not. S is the laid back, go with the flow, sleep with all the girls type. S dated J for a long time. J also dated NY M, who is now dating T who is the girl that brought this new woman around. And J is kind of back with S. It's a weird group. Almost like swingers but not quite.   Anyway, the new woman decides she likes these 2 guys. But now that J is back in the picture, she backed off and decided to go out with Big M. I remember after their first date we saw them at the Rally and she acted like she didn't even know him. She told me he wasn't her type. But now, these two are together all the time. And Friday night, while she is there with Big M, she told me how much she likes S and how she would fuck him in a heartbeat, and she thinks they have so much in common, but she really doesn't want to hurt Big M. and she has to try to control herself around S. That kinda pissed me off.   So I told T about it Sunday night (we had a little fire and wine) and she has now decided it is her mission to confront the hussy about it. Can't wait to see how that turns out. Hope I'm not there when it happens.   Enough for now. But I feel chatty today...

      I had this dream last night that I was working at the bar again. I was coming in for the late shift and KT was just getting off. The place was a disaster. There were tables pushed all over, plates and silverware everywhere. KT had the water running to fill up the sink and I forgot about it. For some reason, even though the place was a mess and was really busy, I ended up standing in the corner talking to someone for like an hour and wasn't serving anyone. Someone kept going behing the bar with a mop and I didn't know why. Finally I realized that people were waiting for me to serve them.   There were two guys, a lady and her son sitting at a table by the door. I made it back behind the bar and the two guys wanted another pepsi in a glass. But all the glasses were dirty. I figured out that the guy that kept going behind the bar was mopping up the water that kept overflowing from the sink that KT left on. I remember wondering why he didn't just turn off the water.   I got two glasses cleaned and one guy wanted fountain pop and the other wanted it from a can. I gave the pop to them and they said to forget it because I took too long. They laid a $10 bill on the bar and walked to the back. I remember wondering if the $10 was for me, but why would I get a $10 tip if I didn't serve them fast enough, so I figured it must be for the pepsis for the lady and her son. I gave them the pop and it looked weird, like it was all watered down or something. The kid took it anyway and drank it.    Now. What was that all about?  I am particularly wondering about the place being in total disarray and me just ignoring it. The bar was set up exactly like it really is. The only person I knew was KT. And apparantly I was worried about it because I felt stressed when I woke up.  I dunno...

      1. I can't get the kennel on the phone. I'm supposed to take my dog there Friday, and haven't been able to confirm. 2. Cramps. 3. People who call me about a computer problem, and then swear at me when I tell them to reboot.  Sorry. It's the first thing to try. And I sure as hell am not going to walk over there to do it for you. 4. My boss brought his dog to work and I can't. 5. My ankles are swelling and I forgot to take my water pill.  6. I need to go get my hair colored after work, but be home by 8 - in time for the cable guy who says he'll be there at 8 with the new box but probably won't show until 10.  7. I need to go grocery shopping and shampoo my carpets.  8. Spreadsheets. 9. Haven't had sex in 3 days. Only one time was my fault. I fell asleep... 10. Cramps. Did I mention that?

      Well I took that personality test that I kept reading about.  urlLink Take it here.   Here are my results.  I guess it's pretty accurate.  Wackiness: 46/100 Rationality: 24/100 Constructiveness: 76/100 Leadership: 44/100  You are an SECF--Sober Emotional Constructive Follower. This makes you a hippie. You are passionate about your causes and steadfast in your commitments. Once you've made up your mind, no one can convince you otherwise. Your politics are left-leaning, and your lifestyle choices decidedly temperate and chaste.  You do tremendous work when focused, but usually you operate somewhat distracted. You blow hot and cold, and while you normally endeavor on the side of goodness and truth, you have a massive mean streak which is not to be taken lightly. You don't get mad, you get even.  Please don't get even with this web site.

      So, I used to bartend at this little joint not far from where I live. It's my hang out now. If the place ever shut down, I don't know what would happen. All of my friends I have now, I met there. We would be lost without it.  I ended up with the job after my divorce. I knew someone who worked there, and she felt bad for me so she told me she worked Wednesday's and I should stop in and see her.  I had driven past this place a least a million times and never realized it was there. After a month or so, the owner asked me if I wanted to work there. She said I had a good personality and everyone there seemed to like me.  I had absolutely no clue how to bartend. She didn't care.  So I went in one Wednesday for training and that was it. I was officially a part-time bartender.   I couldn't mix drinks to save my life. I remember being so nervous when a woman would come in because I just KNEW she was going to want some damn froo froo drink. I was used to the truckers and construction workers. It was pretty much a beer/shot bar. It got to the point that I would refer to someone by what they drank.  You know, the Miller Lite draft guy, the Johnny Walker on the rocks guy, etc.   At least until it got late. Then all the younger, I-need-to-see-your-ID crowd would come in. I didn't even know what a Jaeger bomb was til I worked there.  That has got to be one of the stupidest ideas ever.  Let's mix an upper and a downer and get all fucked up and puke.  That's what they should call it. The "let's-get-all-fucked-up-and-puke-bomb". Most people I know, if they drink more than one or two, puke.  And they're expensive too.  Waste of money.  After a while, I got to know who the regulars were, and looked forward to them coming in.  There was this one guy from the west side who was there everytime I worked until close.  He would get wasted and sleep in his van in the parking lot.  I tried to tell him he could still get a DUI that way, but at least he wasn't driving. And I didn't mind him anyway, he wouldn't let new guys mess with me and he always took out the trash.  One night, we were having a party in there for someone's birthday or something. Things were getting kinda boring, and the owner was worried people would start leaving. Saturday's were never very busy, and there were quite a few people there, and she wanted to keep them there as long as possible. So she comes up with this idea of people doing belly shots. The other barmaid had a bunch of shooters she got from somewhere and we decided that for 5 bucks, the guy could do a shot of his choice and keep the shooter. The only catch was the shots were to be done off of my belly.  OK. So that's harmless enough I guess. I down a shot of courage myself and hop up on the bar. All eyes are on me. When you're the type of person who doesn't do well in the spotlight, this is nerve-wrecking. So I laid down on the bar and west side is the first, um, volunteer? He decides tequila is the thing to do, so next thing I know, there's salt on my belly, tequila in my navel and a slice of lime sticking out of the top of my jeans.  Good thing I was single at the time. The owner was taking pictures like mad. It wasn't too bad, a little sticky, and then it was over and I sat up.  There was now a line of guys who wanted to do these shots.  I had jack, rum (sticky!), tequila, jaeger (that stains), and even beer on my belly. I was up there for quite a while.  After that I was known as the belly-shot girl.  It was even on the sign for a while.  Til the new owner took over. She sucks. I'm not allowed on the bar anymore. I did do a private belly shot session at a friend's house once since then. There are rumors that he and another friend of ours are looking at buying part of the bar. I guess she'd only still have like 20 percent.   Maybe belly shot girl will make a comeback?

      I just got in trouble at work for making an off color joke.&nbsp; Someone emailed the office asking if anyone had seen the box cutter that was supposed to be in the supply room.&nbsp; My reply to all (big mistake) mentioned something about an Arabic man.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; It just happened before I could think. As soon as I sent it&nbsp;I recieved this statement from my supervisor:   "Um…yeah….you can't really say that in email. Can't really make ethnic, religious or sexual cracks in email."   Right I forgot. My bad. It's true though. I shouldn't have done it and you can bet I won't do it again. I wouldn't be so upset about it if I thought that would be the end of it. But I'm willing to bet that I will be in meetings all day tomorrow, getting scolded for my inappropriate email. I could even end up on probation.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm used to working for little companies, with under 10 employees, where you can say things that real people say and not worry about all this political correctness bull shit.   And the ironic thing is, our company performs Patriot searches.&nbsp; You know, the search that checks *ahem*  Non-American  names when they are applying for a mortgage to make sure they aren't a suspected terrorist? Sorry people, the thought is just always in the back of my head!   See what one little bad decision can do?

      Anybody there?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  I don’t think a whole lot of people read my blog.&nbsp; And that’s ok.&nbsp; Sometimes I find myself censoring what I write.&nbsp; I don’t lie, I just kind of leave some things out.&nbsp; I guess it is out of fear that someone I know will find it.&nbsp; But I guess as long as I am honest, I shouldn’t worry about it.  &nbsp;  Bad Dog  I almost yelled at the dog last night when I shouldn’t have.&nbsp; I walked into the kitchen to find a BIG puddle on the linoleum.&nbsp; She just came in!&nbsp; What the hell?&nbsp; Wait a minute…that’s water…from the dishwasher.&nbsp; Great!&nbsp; That will match the leak from the shower!&nbsp; The one that made the ceiling in the garage black. I love owning a home.  &nbsp;  Dum dum da dum…  I have a wedding to go to on Saturday.&nbsp; Which means I have to wear a dress.&nbsp; Which means I can’t wear my boots.&nbsp; Which means I will probably trip or fall off my heel at least 5 times during the night and people will look at me like I am a moron. Probably more as the night goes on. I’m so not girly when it comes to clothing and shoes. I’d much rather sit in my jeans and skechers than an uncomfortable dress and painful shoes. But I’ll look good, dammit.  &nbsp;  Sandy Beaches.  We are supposed to go on vacation this winter to Cancun. I can’t wait. I’ve never been anywhere like that before, and I haven’t been to a beach in probably 8 years.&nbsp; I love the ocean. And I don’t want to rush into winter but I’m so excited to go!&nbsp; Hot sun, pina coladas at the tiki bar, renting a motorcycle for a day, shopping.&nbsp; It’ll be great.  &nbsp;  What?  My thoughts are really scattered today. I can’t really concentrate. I don’t know why, I got plenty of sleep.&nbsp; Sometimes I just get like this. And the thoughts I’ve written about are exactly how my brain works, jumping from subject to subject.&nbsp; Random thoughts that enter my head unprovoked.  &nbsp;  Maybe I’ll ramble some more later.

      I have not been to any bike rallies in the few years I have been riding.&nbsp; I’ve been on poker runs and been to bike night at a couple of places, but nothing like this. Although I hear the crowd was not a large as usual, there where still quite a few people there.&nbsp; I don't even know if you would call it a rally.&nbsp; It all started 15 years ago, I guess, when this guy that owned a farm got together with his friends one July day and decided it was a good idea to jump a bike into his pond. I don’t know what kind of bike it was, but I’m betting it wasn’t a Harley.&nbsp; 15 years later, he still does this, only he gets to sell tickets for it and there’s a lot more people there.&nbsp; There is a tree with all of the past bikes hanging in it.&nbsp; Now that I think about it, I forgot to get a picture of that.&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;  So Friday morning S and I went down to set up camp.&nbsp; At 6 AM.&nbsp; Blah.&nbsp; A couple beers later, camp was set up.&nbsp; I have to say I’ve never had beer that early in the morning.&nbsp; Breakfast of champions.&nbsp; So then we went back home, and I took a nap.&nbsp; After boyfriend got off work, we hopped on the bike and we were on our way.&nbsp; S and J were already there. Friday was kind of tame, though the later it got the drunker everyone got. I started noticing more and more breasts that were not quite staying in their shirts. Girls will do that for those cheap Mardi Gras beads.&nbsp; And after a while, they’ll do it just for the hell of it.&nbsp; Actually, after a while, they'll show just about anything.  &nbsp;  Saturday was the jump. Crazy mother fuckers on snowmobiles, 4-wheelers and dirt bikes jumping off a mound of dirt into the nasty muck-filled pond.&nbsp; A ford truck with a winch on it waited nearby to remove them from the pond, with the help of divers attaching the chain.&nbsp; I don’t care who you are, that has to hurt when you hit the water.&nbsp; Especially the guy that rode down with nothing on but his shoes. I didn’t go in the pond, but judging from the looks of him when he got out, the water must’ve been pretty damn cold.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Sometime during the day I got up the nerve to get into a flashing war with J, who was standing across the way from me.&nbsp; Next thing I know, cameras are going off, guys are trying to hand me beads, yelling “do it again, I didn’t get a picture”.&nbsp; OK.&nbsp; ESPN filmed us, SpeedVision filmed us, and dirty old men filmed us. I guess the Speed channel will have a special this fall.&nbsp; I inadvertently flashed the off-duty police officers who were hired for security. They didn’t really seem to mind.  &nbsp;  There were other contests besides the jump.&nbsp; The weenie bite, the bike wash, the slow ride, and the wet t-shirt contest.&nbsp; By the time that rolled around, J and I decided we were going to enter.&nbsp; But the closer it got, the more nervous she got, and eventually chickened out. I, however, was brave.&nbsp; Wearing my riding boots and the&nbsp;tiger striped&nbsp;thong bikini S gave me, I found myself on the stage.&nbsp; Some girls were fully clothed, some were dressed like me, and some seemed to have misplaced all of their clothes.&nbsp; There were no T-Shirts. It was more like a strip tease than a wet t-shirt contest. I think we all had to dance like 2 or three times and then they narrowed down the winners. The prizes consisted of money thrown on the stage by the crowd.&nbsp; There were some girls up there that really shouldn’t have taken their clothes off.&nbsp; But I guess all people like all different shapes and sizes.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I’ll tell ya, that’s a major buzzkill to do something like that for the first time. But judging by the crowd's reaction, I guess I wasn’t all that bad.&nbsp; I didn’t win, but I did make it to the finals.&nbsp; I think 2nd place was a professional stripper.&nbsp; And she paid for her boobs, I was just going with what I was given (which isn’t much). 1st place was a nice girl, and she was stacked better than I, so they liked her more.&nbsp; That’s ok though. I still had fun. And I still have the picture in my mind of boyfriend standing there in the crowd, next to some of his work buddies. They all looked pretty shocked. One thought I was anti-social the first time he met me.&nbsp; I think I was able to rectify that situation.  &nbsp;  I got a phone call from NY on Sunday.&nbsp; He called me Miss Superstar.&nbsp; Guess word travels fast around here.&nbsp; He was at a picnic and someone he knew must’ve been at Kamikaze.&nbsp; His girlfriend T lectured me.&nbsp; But she thought boyfriend would be mad.&nbsp; I think he liked it.&nbsp; Actually I know he did.  &nbsp;  And he says I’m entering it again next year.

      &nbsp; I had another messed up dream the other night.&nbsp; I was quitting my job to go back to my old job.&nbsp; All the people in my dream were people I really work with, but I have no idea what kind of business we were running.&nbsp; We all had computers with dual monitors like we do now, but half of them were outside – and I swear it was the front yard of my parents’ old house.&nbsp;   I remember as soon as I told my boss I was quitting, she starting delegating my daily tasks to everyone.&nbsp; The girl I work with that just got married in real life came over and took my computer.&nbsp; She said she was taking over for me and needed to get my computer set up for her but didn’t know how to do it.&nbsp; So I don’t know how she was going to do my job.&nbsp; I told her I wanted to get some files off of it first, but for some reason I never got too.&nbsp; I told her I would set up the computer for her, but I couldn’t because I was quitting, and if I wasn’t quitting she wouldn’t need the computer.&nbsp;   Another girl was running around watering plants. I guess that was part of my job too.&nbsp; I wish I could draw because explaining this is hard.&nbsp; Like I said, the front yard felt like it was at my parents’ house, only bigger.&nbsp; But the desks that were outside were covered with concrete, like a sidewalk on pillars and they twisted all over the yard covering these randomly scattered workspaces.&nbsp; The plants were on top of the concrete, and then there were little roofs over top of the plants.&nbsp; And all of the plants were weird looking, like they were from the rain forest or something.&nbsp; I guess that’s why they needed the little roofs over them.  I had to leave for the day, it was a Friday, and come back on Monday to get all my stuff.&nbsp; So I came back with the boyfriend, and the whole time I kept saying “I think I’m making a mistake, I don’t even know how much they are going to pay me.”&nbsp; We walked inside the building (apparently my old desk was right outside the front door) and we walked into this creepy huge storage room to get my stuff.&nbsp; There were drawers on the wall to the left, like the kind they have in the morgue in movies.&nbsp; All my stuff was in these drawers.&nbsp; To the right were a really huge washer and dryer.&nbsp; All my clothes were there.&nbsp; The boyfriend’s clothes were there too.&nbsp; It was really odd.&nbsp;   Then we were leaving, and we walked past this room, and there were all these carp on the floor and they were all really bright orange.&nbsp; I remember feeling sad for them because they weren’t in water and they were dying because they couldn’t breathe.&nbsp; We made it back outside, I said bye to my boss, and we got into this really old truck that was parked along a concrete wall and left.&nbsp; I started again about how I thought I was making a mistake because I didn’t know how much I was going to get paid, and I didn’t like working there before. And I was worried because I didn’t get my files off of my computer, but then I remembered the girl didn’t know how to set it up anyway.  What the hell is that supposed to mean?

      Sometimes life really gets under my skin.&nbsp; It just has to start with something small going wrong, and then the next thing I know, my overactive mind has created a monster. One bad thing, and all of a sudden, all I can think about are the things I need to do that I’m not doing. &nbsp;Things that aren’t really all the bad, but I make them bad. Imaginary bad things.   Those relaxation techniques would probably come in handy now.&nbsp; But I forget how to do them.&nbsp; I could never clear my mind enough anyway.&nbsp; I would try.&nbsp; And I would just fall asleep.   So my annoyances started last night. I fed the dog.&nbsp; I emptied her new bag of dog food into the big Rubbermaid container. I went upstairs.&nbsp; The dog usually eats in about 2 minutes flat, then come upstairs to be let out.&nbsp; She didn’t come up.&nbsp; Finally I&nbsp;went down there, and there she was, eating all her food.&nbsp; Because I am a dumbass and didn’t put the lid on it.&nbsp; So I get her outside, knowing she is going to puke after eating all that. She didn’t though.   Later on I was on the computer, emailing pictures from last weekend’s wedding to some people.&nbsp; IE kept locking up on me, I couldn’t get into my email, and the CPU was at 100%.&nbsp; WTF.&nbsp; I had a Windows Explorer window open and Internet Explorer.&nbsp; That’s it.&nbsp; So I ran Ad-aware.&nbsp; Didn’t find much.&nbsp; I noticed that notepad.exe and windows messenger were gone.&nbsp; I had that happen before.&nbsp; Pinfi virus or something.&nbsp; So I ran AVG.&nbsp; It was late so I went to bed.&nbsp; I was going to check AVG in the morning and see if it found anything.   Went to bed with no sex.&nbsp; So I knew I was going to wake up feeling frustrated and guilty.&nbsp; Frustrated because I kinda wanted some, guilty because I guess I could have initiated it.&nbsp; But I was kind of sleepy, and then he rolled over on his belly, so that pretty much stopped any ideas I had.&nbsp; And he could have initiated too.&nbsp; I guess he kind of did when he said “why don’t you suck my dick?”&nbsp; I don’t know.&nbsp; Sometimes that’s fine when he says it that way.&nbsp; Sometimes it bothers me.&nbsp; Last night it didn’t do anything for me.   So his alarm went off this morning, way earlier and louder than mine and that always pisses me off.&nbsp; I’m not a morning person anyway.&nbsp; I got up to pee and saw that the lovely dog puked in the hallway.&nbsp; A little tiny spot.&nbsp; I went into the bathroom, and she peed on the floor in there.&nbsp; Nice.&nbsp; At least it’s on the linoleum.&nbsp; So I walked down the hall to let her out.&nbsp; I smelled something funny.&nbsp; OMFG, she SHIT on the floor.&nbsp; She never does that.&nbsp; I get her outside, turn on the light and she had pissed in there too!!! I was pretty fucking&nbsp;upset by then.&nbsp; So I started cleaning it up.&nbsp; At 5:45 in the morning.&nbsp; I finally got it all cleaned up, let the dog back in, went to wake the boyfriend up because he had apparently turned off his alarm and rolled back over.&nbsp; The fucking dog came back in the house, ran down the fucking hall, and fucking PUKED in the fucking doorway of the fucking bedroom.&nbsp; A lot.&nbsp; Mixed with the spaghetti sauce I let her lick up last night.&nbsp; Cream colored carpet.&nbsp; I think I was beyond upset at this point.&nbsp; So I cleaned up that mess, helped the boyfriend pack his lunch and load some really heavy generator thing into his truck, and went to check AVG.   AVG encountered a problem and needed to be shut down.   OMG!&nbsp; Is this bad karma or what?   I restarted AVG and laid back down for about a half hour.&nbsp; AVG found nothing.&nbsp; So I shut down the computer and left for work.&nbsp; I really just wanted to crawl back in bed.&nbsp; Because this is when I started thinking in overdrive.&nbsp; I have to clean the carpets better when I get home. I have to fix the computer.&nbsp; I really should clean the basement. It smells like the dog. The dog needs a bath because she smells.&nbsp; The basement is full of all my junk that really gets on the boyfriends nerves because I don’t need all that shit, and I really should get rid of it. I have to go grocery shopping.&nbsp; I really should start figuring out what to pack and what I need because we’re leaving for Indy next Thursday.&nbsp; I have to make sure the kennel can take the smelly, pukey, shitty dog again.&nbsp; I hope she just ate too much and isn’t really sick. I never did clean the overspray off of the siding from when we sealed the deck.&nbsp; I didn’t seal my wooden bench. I really should put the lights and tiki torches back up on the deck now that we are done sealing it. &nbsp;I forgot to water my petunia. I need to get gas. I left towels in the washer.   And it just keeps on and on.&nbsp; Rolling through my head, all these thoughts and I just feel more and more frustrated and the more someone tells me to not worry about stuff like that the more I do.   And my boss just pissed me off.&nbsp; All way from Vegas he can piss me off with one fucking email.   I need to release some serious pent-up frustration.

      A friend of mine from work got married this weekend.&nbsp; I am very happy for her.&nbsp; Her new husband, whom I’ve only met a handful of times, seems like a very nice man.&nbsp; I can usually tell a person from a first impression.&nbsp; It was so strange for to me to be at a wedding where the two people actually looked each other in the eyes when they spoke, and smiled and you could just tell that they love each other very much. I couldn’t help but feel a little jealous.  My wedding was nothing like that.&nbsp; It was a disaster from the beginning.&nbsp; I remember standing in the back of the church getting dressed.&nbsp; I stopped and told my matron of honor “Let’s just leave. I can’t do this. I don’t want to do this. Can’t we just leave?”&nbsp; No we couldn’t, she said. I was nervous, that was all, and my parents had spent SO much money on it.&nbsp; So I stayed.&nbsp; I cried during the ceremony. Not because I was overjoyed, but because I was staring into the face of a person I was not in love with, thinking “This is it?&nbsp; This is all I get?&nbsp; This is as happy as I’ll ever be in my whole life? I’m not happy at all”&nbsp; I remember rationalizing in my mind, that I would learn to be happy, and learn that this was as good as life gets, and all those people out there that seem really happy are just that happy because they learned to deal with what they were given.&nbsp; I sobbed during the Father/Daughter dance at the reception.&nbsp; I did not want to kiss him when everyone rang the little bells we had on the tables.&nbsp; I was miserable.&nbsp; I found myself in the bathroom with my matron of honor, drinking Firewater straight out of the bottle.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just wanted to run away.  My wedding night was nothing like I had envisioned. The honeymoon was awful.&nbsp; It was like vacationing with a roommate.&nbsp; Married life was awful.&nbsp; He did what he wanted, I did what I wanted, and we just stayed out of each others way for the most part.&nbsp; No sex, no love, no fun. Finally I began thinking to myself that this was not what I deserved.&nbsp; My mother-in-law and sister-in-law hated me.&nbsp; I didn’t care, because I didn’t like them either.&nbsp; I stopped going to see them on the holidays, which was about the only time we were ever invited. My brother and dad started taking a strong disliking towards him.&nbsp; Slowly they began to realize that he was as ignorant as I said he was, I wasn’t just “being mean to him”.&nbsp; My mom, on the other hand, was still on his side.&nbsp; He really snowed her.&nbsp;   They decided I was depressed.&nbsp; Well, no shit!&nbsp; But they decided that the problem was me, not that I was miserable with the way my life had turned out.&nbsp; She took me to a doctor, who labeled me “mildly depressed and obsessive-compulsive”.&nbsp; He wanted me to take Zoloft.&nbsp; I refused.&nbsp; So they arranged that I go to counseling. Not marital counseling, but to a shrink that decided that I needed to learn relaxation techniques.&nbsp; All this took place even though I would tell them I wasn’t happy because I was married to someone I don’t love.&nbsp;   Eventually I began to distance myself from him.&nbsp; I would sleep on the couch, blaming his snoring for the reason I was out there.&nbsp; I quit going places with him, and eventually he quit asking me to go.&nbsp; I got a motorcycle when he did.&nbsp; I didn’t want to ride with him.&nbsp; I just wanted to ride. That didn’t make him very happy. I started hanging out with his friends without him, which really pissed him off.&nbsp; But I didn’t have any of my own friends anymore, and I needed some sort of social contact.&nbsp; My only friend, my matron of honor, had moved to NC.&nbsp; Finally I must have ignored him enough. He finally left. Which is a whole other story. Sometimes I think back and get really mad that I wasted so much of my life with him.&nbsp; But then, as I’ve mentioned before, I wouldn’t be where I am today.&nbsp; At least I’m happy now.&nbsp;   A little scarred, but happy.

      It's almost time to go!  I'm so excited. I leave tomorrow for Indy.  258 miles on the back of a Fatboy.  Actually, I'm sure it will be more than that once we get lost a few times.  We're taking state routes instead of the Interstate, so it should be interesting.  It will just be nice to get away for a while.   The weather is supposed to be cooler than it's been, but that may be comfortable sitting in the stands.  Last year I roasted.  I kept taking ice from the beer cooler and holding it on my back and chest so it would melt and run down my shirt. (Much to my boyfriend's dismay, I did not have on a white shirt) I'm a puss when it comes to really hot weather.  I never drink enough (well, enough water anyway) and then I get all lightheaded. And hopefully it won't rain tomorrow.  We got rain gear, but I really don't want to have to use it!  I just wish our hotel had a pool.  I would love to go swimming.  Actually, after that much time on the back of a bike, a hot tub would probably be more suitable. I haven't been on a real vacation in so long where I've been able to swim.  I miss it.  I miss the beach, too.  But boyfried says he's taking me to Cancun in March, so I guess I can wait that much longer.  Last year, Rusty Wallace finished 10th at the Brickyard.  He was also doing better in points than he is this year.  I'm kinda taking a liking to that young Kasey Kahne.   Excellent driver for a rookie!  I get a lot of flack for liking the Dodge drivers.  But I've always been a Mopar girl.  Ask my daddy.  So it's great that I get to go with a Gordon and Earnhardt Jr. fan.  Actually, it's no big deal, but they do like to tease me.  Anyway, I don't care. I'm going away for a few days and won't have to think about work or the housework or anything.  I can use the break.  Bring on the Miller Lite!

             I am  Mario .   I like to jump around, and would lead a fairly serene and aimless existence if it weren't for my friends always getting into trouble. I love to help out, even when it puts me at risk. I seem to make friends with people who just can't stay out of trouble.  What Video Game Character Are You?

      Everybody has days where they hate their jobs. I know I do. But I always try to not to take it out on the customer. It’s not their fault that you are unhappy. And chances are, a lot of them don’t like what they're doing either.  Today I went to the store to pick up the pictures I had developed. After standing at the counter for about 5 minutes watching the customer service boy scan in newly received pictures, another employee called his name. “Hey Dan, you have a customer here.” He turned around and stared for the few moments, then came over. The other employee said, “You just have to yell for him sometimes.” Ok right, because why should the person at the customer service counter have to actually pay attention to the customers? I handed the young man my ticket and told him my last name. He took the ticket, tossed some pictures up on the counter, rang up my tampons with the pictures and I was on my way.  Have a nice day too, buddy.  That should have been the end of it, and I never would have thought twice about his rudeness, or that maybe if he tried smiling once in a while, he might not be so angry. However, when I went to open the envelope to look at my pictures, I realized he had given me my mother’s pictures. (Note to self – move farther away from mom). So I went back in the store and set the pictures back up on the counter. He stared at me blankly, as if he didn’t quite know why someone would come in and give him pictures. I told him that he had given me my mother’s pictures, same last name, wrong first name. He asked for my ticket. I reminded him that he had taken it the first time I was there. So he went over to the drawer of pictures and couldn’t find them. He said they must not be in yet, and I should try back tomorrow. I asked him to look through the stack of pictures he was checking in, and he looked at about 3 of them and said they weren’t there. I asked him if I could return my mother’s pictures and he said, “Ummmmmmmmm, well, can’t you just keep them?” OK. I guess so. He said, “Well if it’s your mom, you can just give them to her”. Guess so. So I asked if I could have my ticket back. He asked “Did you give it to me?” Yes, when I picked up the WRONG pictures. “Did I throw it away?” I don’t know what he did with it. He reassured me that I didn’t need it and I should come back tomorrow.  So I left and called my mother to make sure she didn’t have my pictures. She didn’t. I told her I have hers. She has a tendency to get me fired up and told me that I should march back into the store and demand a refund and give the pictures back. Well, I didn’t do that because I was on lunch and due to be back to work in about 5 minutes. I did call the manager to let her know what happened, to find out exactly how long it should take to get the pictures and to make sure I didn’t need that little ticket. She put me on hold for a while and came back and said “Dan said you refused a refund, that’s why you still have your mother’s pictures, and he also said that you never gave him your ticket. Just try back tomorrow after 2:00 and see if they are here.”  So Dan is a little liar, and that pissed me off.  I got back to work, and my cell phone rang. “Ummmmm, this is Dan. Did I just sell you the wrong pictures?”  “Yes”  “Well, ummm, they’re here. You can come pick them up.”

      Sometimes it is hard to keep my big dumb mouth shut. And what's worse, is that a lot of the times, I have to let some smart-ass comment come flying out because I can't open up and explain my thoughts and feelings properly.  So I open my mouth and then close up again.  Not bothering to explain myself, because I can't.  I can't get the words out. I'm so afraid of rejection and failure that I say these stupid things and then realize what I've done and try to ignore it and pretend I never said it. Digging myself into a hole, that's all I'm doing.  If I could just not say anything I would be so much better off. So would the rest of the world around me.  I was doing so good at it too, and then all of a sudden it just exploded.    "What did you say?"  "Nevermind."  Oh no.  With him there IS no "nevermind."  It's all about discussion then, baby.  Which is supposed to be good.  But I'm so used to being wrong.  My opinions were always wrong, my feelings were always wrong, my thought process was REALLY wrong.  He hasn't told me that yet.  But what if I start opening up?  What if I start saying what's really on my mind?  Will I be wrong again like I always was before?  Or is someone actually going to accept the way I am and the way I think and be willing to compromise?  Compromise.  It has been so long since I have been around someone who knew what that meant.  As a matter of fact, I don't think I ever was.  Until now?
