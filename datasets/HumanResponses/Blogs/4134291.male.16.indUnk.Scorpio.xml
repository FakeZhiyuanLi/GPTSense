       Though I've tried before to tell her  Of the feelings I have for her in my heart  Every time that I come near her  I just lose my nerve  As I've done from the start    Every little thing she does is magic  Everything she do just turns me on  Even though my life before was tragic  Now I know my love for her goes on    Do I have to tell the story  Of a thousand rainy days since we first met  It's a big enough umbrella  But it's always me that ends up getting wet    Every little thing she does is magic  Everything she do just turns me on  Even though my life before was tragic  Now I know my love for her goes on    I resolve to call her up a thousand times a day  And ask her if she'll marry me in some old fashioned way  But my silent fears have gripped me  Long before I reach the phone  Long before my tongue has tripped me  Must I always be alone?

      How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now After all the years we been down Aint no way no how, this bullshit can be true We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you  [Verse 1: Eminem] so young, so full of life in vibrant side by side wherever you weres ridin i went so close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit when ronnie died you weres right by my side with a sholder to cry on tissue to wipe my eyes, and a bucket to catch every tear i cried inside it you even had the same type of childhood i did sometimes i just want to know why is it that you surcame to yours and mine i survived it, you ran the streets, i 9 to 5'd it we grew up, grew apart, as time went by us, then i blew up to both yours and mine surprises now i feel the vibe i just cant describe it as much as your pride tries to hide it your cold, you touch its like ice in your eyes is the look of resenment i can sense it, and i dont like it  [Verse 2: Kon Artis]  it was my dream at first to be on spittin a verse on my own album with a deal but shit got burst so i came out i woulda killed a nigga first before i let him disrespect me and check me over some worste some bitch that i wasnt with i would hit her then quit but you would pull a talk with her and tell her she was the shit i told you dont get involved in it, you was smokin the chron with her comin out of the bar with her stumblin half drunk like yall was husband and wife or somethin but me catchin you fuckin other niggers musta hurt you pride or somethin cuz you wont fuck at the mouth with people like you wanted with me when all i tried to do was show your bitch was shifty and ever since the fans and all the shit that i produced you actin like i aint you man and lyin like she can't be loose but i am really you friend, i'm jus trying to tell you the truth but dont hate the game or the player cuz the one that is changing is you  [Verse 3: Proof]  you're only at the top cuz my homie had to stop now we actin like i gotta live only for the block homies in the hood only she be on the tube only gossip on the porch get to speakin on who fools i used to rap with all expect magic like my finger get to snappin and *poof* it jus happen but PROOF is jus actin out the party was stoned Shady made it so my babys aint starvin at home See the devil in you grin since the ghetto we been friends whenever real intelligence thats forever till the end i be the hatred in your eyes and the satan in your lives and wastin my times with these snakes in disguise (how come) when you talk its with bitter is fight and (how come) it's my fault for what you did with your life and everytime i go to hear you and play you look away we barely embrace, you can't even look me in my face.  [Chorus: Eminem] How come we dont even talk no more And you dont even call no more We dont barely keep in touch at all And I dont even feel the same love when we hug no more And I heard it through the grape vine we even beefin now After all the years we been down Aint no way no how, this bullshit can be true We family and aint a damn thing changed, unless it's you
