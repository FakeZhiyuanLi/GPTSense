      i thought of putting a pic of myself today , but dont really feel like it(they all didnt turn out good ) :s heh  heh.. must get myself a real pose first. hmm nth much been happening today,woke up , did some push ups etc... then met my friend for tea time.Played bball at night, ended up having a drink with some of the fellas. Not a bad day i suppose. I planned to just rest my mind from thinking of a person i dont want to. But still i FAIL miserably... I just dont know y after so much that she made me go through , i still miss her. In fact , i think abt her so often that it just gets so hard for me. I just dont know the answer to this question ive been asking myself : Y do i like her so much???

      went to watch a movie with my bro today, like we always do. Watched The Village this time . Didnt really expect the movie to be that way though. Hmm, gonna upload a photo.. just too lazy to plug in the camera and stuff... prolly do it tomorrow then .  im still a little worried abt my friend. She had unprotected sex. What was she thinking ??? I mean, i had my experience of getting carried away and almost did, but she did it spontaneously , without even worrying abt him putting a rubber tube... come on... she's gonna get in big trouble if something happens. I didnt know till a accompanied her to the store (she promised me a can of coke , man. how can i resist :p), and being the psychic person i am (heh heh) i sorta read her lips when she ask the store person for a pregnancy test kit . They didnt have it though. All i can do is pray for her (though im not good at it ) .  She gives in too easily. Hope things go well for her. *crosses fingers*

      hey , well to start things off this year involves me losing my opportunity in basketball (my no. 1 love), finding out that friends arent who they claim to be , a special person who left me heartbroken(my ex-no 1 love).Hmm,,, this is gonna be a long post :s  I got a transfer out of my school to another one early this year.Hopes were high for me, i felt good just thinking abt it. The first few days i was there, i was already in the school basketball team. I started to know more ppl . It just gave me a good feeling that things are going to turn out great. Well, thats definitely NOT the case. Its real tiring travelling from my place to that school. I have to get up at 5 something every morning etc. Couldnt concentrate and so on. I could still tolerate all of that till I sprained my ankle in a match a couple of weeks before the district competition AND 2 days before i get selected into another team. All gone, 2 teams , one dream.. not anymore.All of my hard work. It became too tiring for me and i had to transfer back to my previous school , since i had nothing left to chase after over there.  Ok, so the school im in now is nth special. Its new, and there were many reasons y i didnt want to continue staying there. But 1 thing thats good abt it are my friends. Me and this girl have been just normal friends since last year. I started to have feelings for her and got her as my gf. Things were going great among the 2 of us till something common happened. Jealousy. Accept that it was me. Now this guy is the class most hated (i suppose). If girls were not around , he wounldnt survive. I just wonder how his sex jokes can tickle the fancy of the girls. He's never with the guys. His attitude is just.... unimaginable. He would never be 'one of the fellaz'.. and i mean never. NO guy would like him. So i suppose u can imagine wat happened . Him + my gf being close and all. That was the starting point where our r.ship turned sour. She wouldnt care abt anything that i have to say abt our r.ship. Basically she was the first person i really became so emotionally attached with that it hurts so much. We broke up.  Now im at the 'im-angry-and-not-talking-to-her' stage. She made me promises of taking care of my feelings and so on when she asked me back (we broke up twice). Stupid me believed every word she has to say. The next day after our second break up , i can see her wit that annoying guy being real close again. Nice. Just the day after, and she couldnt give me a break. She wanted to be friends again , has lots to say , but nth to hear from me . she just wouldnt . So, she's just killing me slowly everyday, especially since we are in the same class , and she was my first in being sexually active in certain parts. So, the first cut is the deepest , like they say. I just dunno how i could end up being so down. She's just being happy, flirting and doesnt seem to care abt me or anything that happened. And she claims that she was real serious with me and that she really like me .Yea, right. This has been going on for a while.The answer's right there, but i cant seem to just ignore this sadness and my memories of her....  I can go more into detail abt wat happened between me and her, but it would take up mpre space. I wonder if ppl would get bored reading abt a sad teen.

      i cant really explain wats been going on, my previous posts were kinda simple. Im gonna just make this my diary, at least i feel better. Its funny how other ppl would view another person's problems as something small but dun realise how little their own problems are.  Just got out of bed , i have a 9 day break from school (yay!) . At least it gives me some time not to meet that flirtacious ex-gf of mine and just concentrate on my own life. Feels good dont it !! woo hoo! i try to be optimistic as long as i can, even when i know that i will be hurt when i go back to school . I really liked her , u know. Anyway , just gonna play real basketball . Even if i lost my chances , opportunity will always come to me again . I just need to practice hard for now and see wat it brings me, u know ?  Anyway, breakfast time... im starving.

      will be my last post abt my past.  I guess that everyone couldnt agree with me more that a friend in need IS a friend indeed. U can really see who ur real friends are when ur in difficulties. I just wish that sometimes ppl would just think of wat they're doing to others before actually doing it .This includes my ex. She thinks abt her own feelings and expects me to just stick to that and ignore mine. She thinks that its ok for her to do anything and i have to accept it. Enough abt that though.  Well me n a girl are kinda good friends. I used to go to her for advice and so on. Note that she was my other ex-gf, but i didnt really feel it. She did. She was really being a good friend, consoling me everytime when i feel sad, down , hurt. She's always a call away . I miss those days.... not the bad part, but the part where there is actually someone who understands me. Really, she understood 100% of wat i was feeling . Damn , she's good. I really appreciated her.  Till 1 day , one of my other friends told her that being with her was a bet (totally untrue) which made her mad and out of her mind. I understood if those words came out of my mouth , but to trust other ppl abt us ? come on... anyway i understood cos she really liked me . We shared our first kiss together. She ignored me for a real long time , to make things worse , she told other ppl abt it . I was mad,i dun care wat other ppl think. As long as its the truth. But i soon realised that its ok , and i tried talking to her abt it , she just wouldnt listen. I just relaxed and waited for things to cool down (this all happened during the process of my heart ache..tiring..).  Recently , things were happening in class with me and the other girl , and it got out of hand . Now my good friend here came to me out of the blue and started shouting at me . Saying things like i hurt her and so on , and felt like slapping me . IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CLASS. Being a patient person , i tried to be smarter than her. Plan backfired. I figured that its too stupid, and like her mind was blocked into her own thinking or somehting . It ended up wit a couple of my friends pulling me aside rather than continuing a pointless argument. I was already real down cos of the other girl at that point. I walked out , skipped math, and tears just started rolling down . Great...  A few days later, she came and apologized for her stupidity , i didnt take it at first, but i gave in later on. I figured that u just have to take wat u get. I just dont know where i get all this patience. So , its like their friends are all poisoned by thoughts of me doing things i didnt do , and also thinking that i still have my patience. Im losing these ppl ... slowly ... I dont have her as a good friend anymore, some ppl think that im a person who would do that. And a couple of my friends who told her those things... well lets not mention abt it .  Things are not like last time anymore when friends played a huge part in my life (my cell was always ringing). Right now im just wondering are they really who they are? I forgave all of them , but how much trust do i have in them?  Seriously, I find it hard to trust ppl's words from now on....

      My ex-gf really wasnt worth. I just know it, but i cant accept the fact. I could have given her everything. I had my exs in the past, but never felt this way before. She has her way of realllly (and i mean realllly) hurting a person's feelings. She has a polite manner but it feels like it suits the case of 'dont judge a book by its cover' sort of thing. She has some sort of mood swing which really puzzles me till now. She would say something today, and would say the opposite tomorrow. She would always say to me that she wants to fix our r.ship and so on, and being a complete  urlLink J@cKa$$  the next day. The irony...  After so many fights, even out of a r.ship (i lost count) .  We're still at it. Ive never been this patient in my life. I resorted to sending her notes, calling her which ends up with her throwing away the note, not picking up calls. Till 1 day, she decided to be smart enough and actually listened (yay!) . It isnt worth . It ended up the same thing everyday. Its just a continuous cycle which will never end .  Fast forward, yesterday she text messaged me. Probably enjoying herself seeing my sadness taking over. It ended up wit me saying something like 'grow up!', just trying to knock herself into conciousness. She could get angry and doesnt expect me to get any emotional feelings from her manipulating it.  A lot of things actually happened in our r.ship , and i wish i could express it, but i dont think there would be enough time for me ... Basically , she feels powerful or some sort that i go to her everytime (to fix things u know) even in our r.ship . She doesnt feel wrong that she could break all the rules but i have to follow hers. Sry, but enough is enough . I have my limits.  She did a lot of things to me . That includes backstabbing , heartbreaking , + many others.Which affected my friends and so on... Just wish that i could turn back time and just be less stupid, u know.  So here i am again... Just thinking about how silly i was, and trying to forget things i cant forget, trying to remember things i cant remember.
