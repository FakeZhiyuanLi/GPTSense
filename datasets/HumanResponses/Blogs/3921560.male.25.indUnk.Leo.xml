      Like they say, one's junk is another's treasure.  But having a garage sale is a pain in the rear, and I'm tired.    I've also got to find some time to work on the questions for the panel next week. I'm really looking forward to this conference. It should be a worthwhile event, and a welcome distraction from some problems I've had thrust upon me recently (problems that are not fit to blog). Although I wonder if anyone actually reads this.   Tuesday, August 3 rd , I turn a quarter of a century old. Too much stuff going on. After the conference I'm not doing a damn thing until Labor Day weekend. Saturday I'm going to a  urlLink News &amp; Letters  event and Sunday is my sister's  urlLink commitment ceremony .   The DNC convention is, as expected, a disappointment. Although I'd hate to have Bush win, Kerry is not much better. Listening to Edwards speak during the convention was disgusting. He might as well have been a Republican with his jingoistic, pro-war trite. We need a real alternative!   That's enough junk for one blog.  There's work to do!

            Here's a picture of the costume I've been working on this week.  It is a variation of a Celtic costume.  I'm very pleased with how everything turned out.

      Last week my nephew spent a few nights over playing GameCube and Yu-Gi-Oh!, which is always fun. Then he was on my computer and for some reason, the hard drive just died. So I had to get a new one Saturday. Afterwards, I went with a friend to visit my friend Rick's grave.   I miss Rick terribly, but I feel I've come to terms with his death. Well, as much as one can come to terms with the suicide of one's best friend.   I went to a  urlLink Galactic League  meeting Sunday, and started working on my costume and a short story.  I decided not to go to the  urlLink News &amp; Letters  meeting because I felt I needed to do some therapeutic sewing. Organizing the panel (see post from July 13) hasn't always been fun. I had to reassure people I knew what I was getting into and knew what I was doing in asking such-and-such a person to speak on the panel. I suppose I had better get used to doing such things if I want to get my Ph.D., eventually I'll have to give an oral defense of a dissertation, not to mention submit research proposals. I still hate doing it.

      Actually, it's not as bad as all that.  I'm just planning this panel from my remote location (Lockport!  Without a means of transportation to Chi-town, I might as well be in another country), and I can't understand why people don't check their e-mails or voicemail 20 times a day like I do :-D

       urlLink HRC | Politics of Division Fails in Senate  I'm at a loss for words.  Thank God our senators had enough sense to stop this despicable amendment.  This calls for celebration!

      This past week has been crazy.  Last week my sister's partner had an accident at the factory, but she's doing better now.  She's very fortunate to have survived the incident with all her limbs. I had the damnedest time trying to find panelists for the  urlLink International Conference  panel I've been working on.  At the last minute I got a couple of other people express interest, so that's all set. I went to a  urlLink News &amp; Letters  meeting Monday night on police brutality in Chicago.  We heard from two mothers of wrongfully convicted men.  It was a powerful, emotionally-charged meeting, one that helped put things in perspective.  I knew this was a problem, but hearing about it firsthand from those whose lives were affected by this; it's life-changing.  It made me realize I need to get more involved in this movement. Yesterday I talked with a friend in Oklahoma who's been going through some hard times.  I wish I could be there for him.

      I thought I'd try out Blogger and see how it works.  I don't know if I'll stay here or keep my rants on my  urlLink homepage .  I figure there's no harm in trying.  If you're reading this, feel free to contact me via e-mail or posting a comment.  I'm going to try to post and check comments daily.

      I am in a considerable amount of pain and need to see a dentist.  I have an appointment for this afternoon, and no dental insurance coverage or income.  I just hope Bush doesn't get elected (or appointed) this time around,  this country needs single-payer health care!  UPDATE (20:38): The dentist prescribed Tylnol 3.  I feel better now. :-) (Kids, stay off drugs!)

      I've been thinking about my "friend."  He is someone who has been hurt by others in the past, and so tends to think the worst of people.  He often finds things wrong with others when there is no cause.  A few weeks ago he made some wild accusations about someone.  I did not respond well.  We had a huge fight.  We worked it out, and he realized the problem wasn't with this person, but was something else entirely.  I had thought we had gotten past this, but I guess I was wrong. This is probably for the best.  I get migraines when I'm under stress, and with him I was averaging one a week.  The whole experience made me realize I need to take care of some things in my own life.  I can't have friends who continually bring me down with a negative outlook on life and humanity.  Life is too short for cynicism.

       urlLink San Francisco Examiner: 'Can't take our love away'   I'm upset about this. I thought, with the marriages going on in SF, things were changing. Progress is being made. Now it's as though it was all a dream. I wasn't even there. I would read stories and see pictures of happy couples celebrating, waiting in line for hours to finally get a license, and I would have tears of joy in my eyes for all the happy couples. I'm so emotionally exhausted. Someone whom I thought was a good friend is no longer talking to me, and I don't know why. I don't have words to describe what I'm feeling right now. I know I will get over this, and things will get better. But I wonder if he realizes how much his actions have hurt me. Even if he decides to contact me again, I don't think our friendship will survive. I'll leave it at that. I have no desire for this to degenerate into one of those angst-ridden sappy woe-is-I-the-world-sucks 'blog.  I really can't stand that sort of 'net-garbage!  'Blogging and writing help me work through my problems. It isn't just to vent, but to try to solve some problems, and possibly network with others who share common interests. Time will tell if anyone reads this.

      My birthday was Tuesday.  It was a good day.  I went to Barnes and Noble and picked up  Multitude  with one of the gift cards I got.  Also picked up the second DVD of Heat Guy J and the expansion for Settlers of Catan. Wednesday I was supposed to go to a pre-conference reception, but went out to diner with my family. Thursday I went to the conference, had some good conversations with some comrades and some not-so-good conversations with some others. Friday was our panel, which went better than I had hoped in both presentation and turnout. I hung around the lit tables for the remainder of the conference and took off Saturday evening. Today was the Galactic League "meeting." My sister-in-law and I arrived to find one other person there. About an hour and 15 minutes later, I was starting to regret having left the conference, since no one else showed up. Then finally two others showed up, and we had some good conversations going (although we didn't get much done). It was very enjoyable. All in all, a good week.
