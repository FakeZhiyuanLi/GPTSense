      I received an email from one of my sisters today, that was very scary.  My nephew, is a police officer in a very nice middle class neighborhood, with a below average crime rate.  He was dispatched to a home, a neighbor had called 911 stating that a man was beating up a woman and was trying to force her into a truck.  When my nephew arrived at the home, he noticed immediately the truck that was reported in the 911 call.  He parked his car and walked over the check out the truck, while doing so, he heard a woman scream & the shattering of glass.  He started running up the drive way of the home, as he turned towards the back of the house, he caught a glimse of a man lunging forward in his direction.  (There was another officer running behind my nephew, but in his shadow away from where the guy was - out of sight.)  The man lunged toward my nephew with a butcher's knife in his hand!  My nephew had a split second to react, as the knife was coming towards his face! He turned his head to the right just far enough in that instance to get stabbed in the skull about 1 1/2" above the hairline over his left eye. The man lunged with such force at my nephew   (My nephew's a big boy - 6'2" 240#), the impact knocked him to the ground!!  The other officer still didn't realized my nephew was stabbed ! My nephew had pepper spray in his hand, which was knocked out of his hand, as he fell to the ground.  My nephew was able to get up quickly and the guy was still in view with the knife. My nephew drew his duty gun and shot the man hitting him twice.  The man died at the scene.  Lucky my nephew didn't have too much time to react or he probably would have got the knife in the neck or the chest. The Doctor kept telling him how lucky he was when he was in the ER where they put 3 staples in his head in the deepest part of the stab wound. My nephew has never had to kill anyone on duty. He actually thought he might die because he could not tell how severe the stab would was. He called the dispatcher and told her he was stabbed and then struggled to get to the curb. He was  bleeding  and worried that if he didn't get to the curb they might not find him .He  thought he could bleed to death.He said all I kept thinking about was my family and my children.  This man had already severly beaten his ex-girlfriend, when his mother tried to protect the girl he slashed his mother across her face.  There are times when you watch TV, and think; do those types of crimes really happen?  Or, that's horrible!  But, when it happens to someone in your family, reality hits home!  I have always been proud of my family members who serve in the military, and those who work in law enforcement (another sister in addition to my nephew).  However, I often try not to let myself think about the dangers too often.  Then there are times like this one, where you just have to be thankful that your family member made it through the situation alive and well, although I'm sure there will be a recovery period - mentally.  I am not a religious person, but you can bet I will be saying a prayer of thanks this evening!

       I've been reading about blogs in newspapers and magazine articles lately, and decided to check them out and now to give it a try.  For the first time in a long time, I am sitting by myself ~ bored ~ looking for something interested to do, which is very strange!  Normally, I'm hanging out with my kids, but they are all out with friends tonight.  Can't say I blame them as they are 20, 22 & 23 and in the prime of life!  Who would want to hang out with their Mom at that age- you say?  Well, I'm not exactly old - 41, and I am fun to be around, plus have great kids. On the other hand, I am married, but my husband and I are extreme opposites, which can be a good thing, but often we spend little time together in the evenings....he currently preparing his boat for a day of fishing on the lake, with our youngest daughter.  (Hopefully she's not too hung over in the morning...ha ha...or he may find himself on a afternoon trip!)      So, I'm sitting her at the computer with three dogs laying at my feet, in the peace and quiet of a big house!  Actually two dogs, and a very rampunctious puppy, who at the moment is sleeping and looking adroable.  Chico is his name, he is an Austrailian Cattle Dog, at least that's what the lady at the pound said.  We were told he would be a medium size dog, but I'm currently thinking he'll be BIG!  Oh well, unconditional love from a medium or large dog, it doesn't matter!
