      never thought that i would be watching ice hockey.....what more rooting for Flames...but i am always into any sports ...so watching some fast interesting games especially Stanley Cup finals wouldn't be something that comes out of the blue.....Go Flames Go after all....if they win...everyone in Calgary is happy so it's something good to happen!! Beverly Craven...don't know why i am beginning to like her song 'promise me'.... the song seems to linger in my mind after a few repetition....i think i am not those that'll easily get bored if i like something..........

      I think at this point of my life, friendship is still an important part of me..... i don't know whether those people will find that it's lucky to meet me or not...but i can tell you that if i told myself that i am going to make that person my friend, i will be willing to do anything for that person...maybe because of that, i'll be affected when those people are not happy or if they are happy, i'll be extremely happy...but i ain't that saint after all....i do make mistakes that i actually regretted but i am just a human....toast to my friendship with people that i am thinking now!!!!

      I am now working in a lab now.....feeling a bit excited when i am holding the pipet and titrating stuff....but at the same time feeling lazy to read so many journals.....and i drag to think that i'll have so many things to handle in the coming months......my normal uni exam, research work (with a really good but strict professor) and alas USMLE!!!!Again, i want to stress that i still want to go to the UK for my residency....but i actually don't know where i belongs to...malaysia, US or UK??? I am still confused...just don't know where my life is leading to.....can i just meet someone and then settle down? I think that's the best solution that i can think of....but where to find 'the one'????????????????????

      I actually don't know why i am writing diary again....is it because i need someone to share more things with me...i need a place to pour out all my emotions.....Benji (ok..he was asking about this URL just now....) told me to start a blog when i already had one...weird, i think more and more people start writing with blogspot......i do feel like reading his blog...but little did he know that i am not that '8' after all. I think i am only interested to know what's happening to people that i really really care.....like now, it's TY and Su...

      Hm....few days back when Michelle (my bestest friend!!) told me that she had some antithyroid antibodies against her thyroid...it did frighten me...i wasn't even using my knowledge to make some senses that it wasn't something that is really serious...but the fact that she had some disease made me worry.....at this stage, i really hope that all my dear friends and of course my family will be safe and sound!!

      You must be thinking why among my two housemates, I am always talking about TY and Su... i don't understand it as well....there's just something about TY.....Su...she's a pleasant girl....now i am kinda planning a surprise birthday thingy for her....a cake lit up with balloons around it...will she be delighted when she sees it? Recently, she came back buying FCUK clothes for me and TY...she's just another girl who will put friends above her....thanks gal!! Oh....and i got to say that Su got endless numbers of admirers....guys just get attracted to her...no doubt, she's pretty...while TY is kinda settled down with her fiancee...me is still searching for the one....wonder when only it'll appear...but i am too lazy to go out and socialise. Now that i got myself a research, with USMLE next year and endless number of exams....i don't even have enough time for myself...

      Feel like writing again now....half way throught studying for my exam tomorrow!! Thinking back about TY again...don't know why but her presence and attitude is like somekind of inspirational force to me....i wouldn't say that it's really something really strong but there's just something about her that make me think so....anyway, got to continue studying again

      I am not sure if it's alright to write a diary online but after all these years.....i feel like writing it again...  Hm....today TY is again in doubt on her path again...everytime i see her like this, it just makes me feeling helpless because i know i just don't know how to help her. I seriously hope that she can take things as it goes....to her, i might seems to be someone who's immature, someone who's brain is still not fully developed yet...in terms of thinking but i think i've been taking things the way i want it to be (at least it's not dwelling too far away)...i have been in a playful mood...not because i really like it but because if i am to be down like the rest then things won't be better either...i think this world always need a clown-like personality person to cheer up everyone.....in the next few post...i'll describe more about my personality...

      Today, one of the senior leaves Calgary for good. One by one, they are leaving and probably will be all gone faster than I know. I dread the fact of having to say goodbye everytime because i don't know what lies in front. I fear the fact that i might not see them again. Whenever TY brings on the matter of SH and her leaving 'soon'....i have to control my tears from pouring out....my lacrimal duct is so sensitive even to a mild teasing. I know i'll definitely miss them a lot. I seriously never expect to meet people like TY and SH. Fate brought them to me when i was really lonely. I just have no words to describe how much they mean to me even only knowing them for a short time. Just hope that this coming few months will only be better.

      Today i had an interesting discussion.....and i realise something....one of the reason why i am still strong at times because i find strength in my family and friends. I had to say that my parents are always supportive of what i am doing without much questioning while friends.....thanks...i actually find an inner strength in doing things because i know whatever or however that i am going to do something....i know that i have someone who always have this belief in them that i can do something that is not easily achievable....i know i have a place to fall back...and this really helps especially at times when i doubt myself.

      Just got back from a short break.....staying at Le Chateau Lake Louise, one of the posh hotel in Canada....i was expecting something majestic from the hotel as in the architecture and the intertior design but i was a little dissapointed by it....however, what it could offer is the picturesque Lake Louise....spent an hour studying at the lakeside overlooking the lake, Rockies and valleys....kinda breathtaking....but i still prefer the view when i was at sunshine ski village....it's just so so wide and beautiful......what a creation!!

      Back home, the reason i really feels like going home is because of my dogs but here, the reason i really feels like going home is because i really feel at home....again, weird feelings but true....i just love living with these 2 girls now.....or else i wouldn't stay at home this much! Whenever Su ponders the idea of them graduating and leaving Calgary, i do know that 'the' day will come where i'll just miss their presence terribly!!! Anyway, like what Su said...as long as i am happy with the way things go now.....the rest is not important as of now.

      The 2 friends i am talking about is like my really close friends now......weird but i think we can click real well (in a just few weeks) and then we decided to shift into a lovely house together. I really consider them my half sister now because i can really really relate to them....i have never share so much secrets in person other than these 2 girls....most of the time i prefer writing letters. However, among 2 of them, i have to admit that i am more incline towards TY, i don't know why. Maybe it's her personality that makes the difference. i have never met someone (i know i have only lived for 22years) as generous as her. I mean, she can't be compared to Mother Teressa but to her standard, i can really say that she's truly a generous person. She's smart and capable.....i think i made her my role model at this moment. She's someone that i truly hope that will be really happy and joyful for the rest of her life. Everytime, when i see her stressed out, i really hope that i can help but i just don't know how. I know i won't be able to cheer her up but at the same time i really hope that something could be done. I, myself will be feeling terrible when she's not having a good day....sigh...if only i can make all her wishes come true.....here i wish that whatever that is going to happen in the future will be the way you've wanted it to be....

      Coming to Canada for the first time......I have longed to study abroad since young but the feelings wasn't like what i've expected when i was on the plane ride to Canada on Aug 1, 2003. Maybe because i yearn to go to the UK after my wonderful trip in 1997. Moreover, there's someone in the UK that i wish to meet. The first few months in Calgary was a tough time...trying to accustom to a new living style....there's definitely no cultural shock but i had to admit that i was feeling homesick. I miss my normal daily chores especially looking after my dogs badly. However, I was really lucky to meet one lovely CBC named Hoi Yan...she's my first Canadian friend! Then i met 2 other senior malaysians whom i can relate very well.....Because of them, my life in Canada is brightened up.

      Today, i went to EM's blog after checking her TVB news....then it lead me to Bernie's blog. After reading a few of Bernie's posts, i decided that i should set one up for myself. Here i am with loumurnos@blogspot.com......Lou Murnos...this name is made up of the combination of all my dog's name....Louie, Murnos and Oscar. Louie is a German Shephard, Murnos = a cutie beagle while Oscar is my favourite among all, a smart and the most macho Rottweiler ever to me.....however he died when he was barely 5 years old... a relatively short lifespan for a dog. He died because of a cancer known as lymphosarcoma. By the time we discovered it, it had spread all over his body. Forever mising you, Oscar. Till today, i still haven't gotten out from the misery yet......

      On April 10,2004.....at approximately 2.30am (msia time 4.30pm), I received a call from my brother telling me that my beloved rottweiler named Oscar passed away. I was too shocked to believe it. I was seriously in denial state as i just couldn't accept the fact i wouldn't be able to see and play with him anymore. Never have i felt so sad before. I cried till the next day and was trying to act normally in the morning. Wishing to hide it from my housemates with the reason that i don't want to spoil their day as we should be going snowboarding. I broke down so many times up in the Rockies Mountains. Seeing the sky so wide and bright, all i could think of was, where is my Oscar now? Are you in the sky starring at me? I just can't help but reminisced all the good memories that this lovely doggie had brought to me. All his mischievous acts were only intended to make me smile. Still remember the first day i got him back from the breeder. He was barely 3 months old (around Aug 22,1999), i already knew that I'll shower all my love to make sure that he's going to be luckiest dog ever. I spent all my energy and time looking after him. I just didn't feel tired at all. It was more like fulfilling after spending a day playing and grooming him. However, when i bought my ticket to fly back on April 12, hoping to see him for the last time, he passed away without wanting me to witness his death....perhaps he knows i'll be devastated at that moment..... :^(

      this morning i woke to the feelings that i dreamt of seeing Oscar.......loosing Osacar has created a scar in me........i really love him very much.....i am not sure if i am able to go through the cycle of getting another pet and finally seeing it laid to rest again.....it's too painful in feelings than i could write it out........Oscar is too smart that i cant help but compare his ability to every dog around me......i can still go on and on endlessly about him.....sigh.....i'll never be able to forget my little baby..  In the morning, ate porridge......wonder if i can go down to 52kg.....wanted to try slim down...have been a 55++kg girl for quite sometime....wonder what it feels to be really slim and thin.......

      I am kinda enjoying my time working in the lab doing pipeting, growing and stimulating cells)......i didnt expect myself to indulge in scientific methods like this......but there's a brutal reality behind all this scientific advancement....rats killing....this is the part that i dreaded to do actually.......my heart was moved to tears when i saw the other lab tech removign 2 baby rats from its mother, poor mother was searching all over for it....my tears was rushing immediately...and the worst thing was i actually saw 2 beautiful Siberian Husky sitting in their cage.....not sure what experiement they will go through.....please.....dont let them suffer.....  *brutal?? If me, myself is considering this brutal, i figure the G.W.Bush and tons of stupid government or terrorist groups leaders must have been cold blooded as it's human lives that are involved all the time in their hunger of power and materials.....

      Back to my Japan holiday......i have never felt so contented before...this trip and so many good things really made me feel that i am actually leading a very very very lucky life although i am only 23 (+ 1 day)....  Meeting Yuko again on July 26....is really something that i have been looking forward to......on Monday, July 26.......her parents took me to Osaka Castle then at night, i went out to somekind of cozy shop looking at Yuko practising her guitar......then on tues, she brought me to Kyoto....i actually fell in love with Kyoto.....i love the city for that it's a blend of modern and traditional and nature kind of feelings.....from modern Japanese buildings to old shrines and temples and also the flowing river. I swear i would go back to Kyoto at least 2 more times in my life...spring and autumn!!!! On that night...i had a very interesting conversation with her.....chat a lot about what we think of life..and i actually felt really comfortable telling her about Oscar.....i know she will understand exactly how i feel...and truly enough, after telling her about it, i was getting more ready to accept Oscar's death for some untold reason......after this chat i know a lot about her perspective of her life much more......... she and her mainstream theory.  Wed.....Yuko's birthday!!! Decorated her kitchen's glass door....should have done more...but no transport and didnt dare to make too much requests.....cooked her a successful pumpkin rice and curry chicken...they love it...so am i!!! Happy birthday......at nite, she brought me to a wonderful tofu restaurant that i love it so so so much......  Thurs....there we set off for our Disney adventure...taking bullet train again this time...but love to travel with someone i am close to...at least can chat about something that i love to and not to force out some conversation.....though it seems to come out from me simultaneously but i actually hope that i could keep quiet....and yet i cant stand quietness....sigh....that's me....  Disneyland..........i never expect myself to stay in such a nice hotel....going to Disneysea.....didnt really enjoy a lot like what i've expected initially but right after i found mermaid lagoon.....i am a changed person...i was so absorbed into it that my mind was telling me not to leave that place!!!!! I just love it.....spent quite some time in it, that by the time we left it's already dawn and the atmosphere started to become really really nice.....it has the ambience of a peaceful town with scenic view........i love the night view of disneysea....it's just amazing......and i actually wept a bit seeing the view from the aladdin palace across the lake to our hotel.....i cant believe i am actually able to enjoy such thing even though i am only 23yr old!!!! And i was actually happy that Yuko was there....my close friend after all.....and at the same time i was actually hoping that yein and su and leybie were there to share it......dunno why them......maybe because my life revolve in calgary with them!! Disneyland......as expected....swarmed with people...lively atmosphere......and such a cute Pooh attraction.......oh gosh........i love the shops there......and i love the hotel i was staying in.....so comfy!!!  Going back to osaka on saturday......sigh...end of my wonderful disney wonderland tour.....even though i was tanned...but nvm...it's all worth it!!!! On sunday....though yuko wanted to bring me to Kobe...but got cancelled,nvm...my mind didnt want to go anyway...prefer to see yuko is relaxing rather than planning hectically.....when i am on vacation....i hope ppl who is with me....will enjoy it as well......like what i told her...maybe when i was younger...i might want to travel more but now....i would rather opt for quality time spent....not sure it's because i am no longer a teenager but i want to appreciate something more than rushing to do it!!! Actually, I would prefer another day in Kyoto than in Kobe (hehehe  ^O^ ) but nvm....i will be back!! Anyway...had fun seeing around Osaka!!! Goodness...the ppl...it's so crowded everywhere!!!Oh wait.....okomiyaki for dinner!!!......i love it!!!!! some nice little pancake!  Monday.....blue.....sigh..leaving Japan soon......today...went to do some souvenirs shopping.....guilty that it's yuko's parents footing the bill again......they are just too nice!!!!! Monday BLUE is really hitting me hard...i was actually quite down ......but was waiting for yuko to come home...cooked and ate takoyaki....this was so good!!!!......wore yukata and played fireworks!!!...what a wonderful night.... weird (wearing kimono to a playground playing fireworks after such a long time!!!) but fun.  Yuko....i am going to miss my vacation......reaching airport....i was still feeling ok.....i know i am recharged,ready to go back to continue my unfinish business.......but my heart was so heavy when it was at the point where I had to hug and leave them......my eyes went teary but i held it....i know i had a wonderful time and i actually want to turn back and stay......but i was ok after that.......maybe because i really had a a fulfilling holiday...no complain at all.....a holiday that all my friend and perharps millions of ppl will be jealous of!!!!  This time i didnt miss Yuko that much compared to her first visit in Malaysia......the only reason i could think of was.......i spent enough time knowing her this time compare to our first meeting (only got to meet for less than 2 days.)...........now my respect and admiration for her has grown stronger.......  Hope to see her again in canada!!!

      Yesterday was July 18,2004. It was such a memorable day for me.....in my opinion, the most special and surprised party i ever had in my life to date!!!!!!  &nbsp; I got back from my research work at about 6pm....feeling not so right because of some of my thoughts and tired and the heated-oven feeling in my house.....i was just not feeling right......then my housemates got back...telling me that they want to celebrate my birthday earlier.....want to have an early celebration....before this, i was told by yein that i'll have a SURPRISE party that it's intensity is bigger than any of those that we had organised before!! But then, everyday, she'll be telling me that she hasnt figured out what to do for the surprised party....little did i know that she actually planned for yesterday!!! &nbsp; They made me dressed in a dress that they bought for me, 'paint me' heheehhe......then toom me out telling me that we are heading to somewhere that i havent been before.....i was too tired to have any suspicion in me.....then she bought me to a Westin hotel room, of course i know what is going to happen next! My surprise party!!!! &nbsp; Inside the room, they decorated it with tealites candles at every corner of the room, helium-filled balloons (72 altogether) floating at the ceiling, having rose petals spread on the bed with white bedsheets with a lovely heart-shaped cake(lighted with fireworks) and a big white doggie bear bear&nbsp;in the middle and lastly, with a bubble-maker, making lots of bubbles....what an atmosphere...with the yellow lights shining on all these....i was thrilled....never would i expect something like this would happen!!!! I am really really really feeling lucky.....what a surprise for my 23rd birthday celebration!!!! &nbsp; Then at bout 8pm, we head to one of the hotel's restaurant, ON restaurant for a wonderful dinner....i ordered a pretty good salmon for dinner..... &nbsp; Later at night, we were all half-drunk and puked somewhere along the line.....nevertheless, it was definitely a wonderful day for me!!

      Actually now is......July 21, 10.57pm..but i had an inclusion that i want to post but just somehow i was too excited about something else that i forgotten about it!!!  Going back to malaysia........i could sense that my body and mind was tired when i was travelling back to msia.......but kinda happy reaching home....my heart was really joyful and i was seriously smilling from my heart....this is my homeland after all.....Ivory is picking me up...she is definitely a really worthy friend!!!!  Was happy to see all my family members but definitely could feel that my heart was searching for Oscar all the time!!!!!!! I just miss him so much....wept definitely after seeing photos of him passing away.......those images will never be erased from my heart.... :(  Had to do so many things in malaysia.....i did it voluntarily.......had to apply for visas...US visa worries me but it was a huge relief that i found that i could get it within a day!! hooray!!! Then next on my list...Japan air ticket!! hehehe  In malaysia, i never had a holiday/ break for myself.....i was tired everyday......but going to Japan...though i chose to go there for almost 2 weeks....my family is complaining that i am spending too much time out there but it's all worth it as i finally feel that i am back to a healthy state of mind!!! .......it was in Osaka that i felt really relaxed....the holiday pace was really good....had enough time to sleep yet adequate time to play.......

      I LOVE Japan...this is probably the last time i am going to talk about JAPAN.........i simply i talk to much about that people around is starting to feel boring......sigh....but my emotion is still running high even now it's already 2 weeks after i come back from Japan.  &nbsp;  I really love Japan to the extent that i promise myself that i'll go back at least twice but there might be many more visits in my life.....all thanks to the wonderful people that i met in my trip that made my japan trip such an enjoyable one!!!  &nbsp;  First in Fukuoka, even though only knowing those friends for less than 6weeks...but they showed really kind and warm hospitality that i thought i am really lucky to meet them!! They brought me around, showed me Fukuoka city, which is like any other Japan city, a crowded but interesting for a tourist. This is the first time i see how people can fit so many things in such a small space....and yet, the stuff there are well organised and neat. Then finally get to go to Osaka!!!!  &nbsp; Wanted to meet Yuko in Osaka for god knows how long!!!!! She is just a rare friend of mine....both of us has similar thoughts in some ways....but our path is almost completely different.....it was interesting to hear her talking about her being someone who's not so mainstream and ....i'll explain further in my other post. &nbsp; Wow.....bullet train...it's real fast and expensive!!!! Finally reached Osaka.....seeing Yuko itself is a joy.....i was smilling in the heart seeing her sitting at the station waiting for me. But meeting her only for the second time, i didnt have any moment of ease trying to cook up some topics of conversation. We just click once we started talking....something that i think is rare.....coz i wasnt even feeling that we had meet each other since May 2003......it was like i am meeting someone whom i am very close, someone whom i am very comfortable with..... &nbsp; Then the adventure that i am hoping for since i started writing to her has finally begin!!!!!!

      In the midst of reading the news of Japan's win over China in Asia Cup final......a controversial finals....it sparked the anger and fume of the Chinese over Japan, more so the resentment that has been lingering the Chinese since WWII....i was pondering the same matter at one point when i met Yuko when she was in Malaysia and also this time in Japan, i was thinking how come i would like to know her who is a Japanese and also why i actually love Japan so much.....when i think back of Japan invasion to Malaysia and China (much to my dismay) where tons of my 'family members' could have died or suffered in consequence to that tragedy......however, i came to conclusion that i can't simply blind myself with that fact and not reach out for more. I should not stereotype one person because of the history that one had no control of....I,myself have always been someone who does not like to have a strong first impression of someone......with the simple reason that what i see in superficial might not be what in depth.  The truth is yuko is an individual who knows more about Japan's occupation during WWII than most Japanese is my pleasure....imagine if i got some other ignorant japanese as my friend, my friendship probably wouldn't have gone this deep....Moreover the current Japan is like any other country with its new generation begining to generate a whole new different image.

      Not sure when i finally able to accept the fact that Dr.M is not a true good man.....i had always given the excuse to myself that someone can corrupt if they are still doing good (because everyone corrupts...boooo!)....i told myself that even Dr.M was corrupting but in the end Malaysia is still prospering.....but i come to realise that i shouldn't let this kind of mentality to forgo my stand that it's only black or white.....the rule that i had reminded myself over and over again in doing things......not sure why i was defending Dr.M all these while.....was it because he's a doctor.....i wasnt sure if i am right for that i once called him my idol......now i just realise that he' no better than any of those shitty rulers just that he's with a little bit more brain neurons connection. What made me think so now and not before because, even he had stepped down as a PM (a post he held the same year i was born!), he is stil engaging in those dictator type of style trying to be the chairman of this or that.......i bet he had more than enough to feed himself even if he decided to live luxuriously as a tycoon.....his wealth will never drain as he probably F*******ly eat up a lot of taxpayer money.....can't he just shut his mouth and stupid ego and just 'rest' at home......somehow, i now started to feel ashame when anyone mentions that he's my great ex-PM.....i feel like puking...........

      I realised i really missing Oscar a lot. I can't seem to let him go away from my mind. Thinking back at my conversation with Yuko that night, i wouldn't have thought that i could meet someone who actually had the similar bitter experience.......she never tell me a lot of any sad story about her....the only few times that i can recall now is John, Tas and her grandpa's death....it seems that she'll only let it out if there's someone who's utterly close or important to her or else, she would keep it to herself emotionally. Again, 'thank god' for answering my prayer....i really know that i found 'the penpal' that i'd wished for from the first day i decided to write!  It's the photo that i pasted on my new DIY photo album.....i recalled exactly the moment i took that pic with Oscar, it is still so unreal that he left me......Aug 5.....today is a year and 4 days since the last time i saw him......my heart still ache so much that whenever i think of him, my tears bud will just loose it's inhibition......how unfair it is that he is not living any longer......i don't know when it will be the day that i can really accept that he no longer alive.....he's still very much in my heart.....i still ponder at the i did not get to see him off............sigh....
