      This would mark the first time for me to post on this blog. I have posted on several blogs previously, though most of them are dilapidated and decayed due to ill-usage and now lies abandonded in the eternal abyssal darkness called the Internet. Hopefully, this one does not share the same fate as its predecessors.   And with all beginnings, I suppose that an introduction is in order. By this point, should you feel the need to leave, please click on the little box with the large "X" on the upper right-hand side of your browser, thus effectively banishing my unsightly little blog away from your existence.  Now where was I? Oh yes, and introduction...  My name is Shahriman Latif. At the time of writing, I am merely a month away from turning twenty three years of age. And for the inept, or absent minded, I am the writer of this blog you now are starting at. This is evident by the fact that I am actually writing it. If someone else was writing it, then it would be someone else's blog, definitely not Shahriman Latif's.  I've been told, as is evident by now, that I tend to be long winded when trying to reach for a point in something. I would take all the possible turns, go through all the possible alleyways, make all possible stops, and lull whoever it was that was unfortunate enough to listen to my ramblings or read then, into an overwhelming sense of boredom and utter impatience, before arriving to my point.  And usually there was no point to begin with, or the point I was going for was lost even to me during the long and arduous journey of my getting there.  I am presently living in a rather peaceful urban area named Subang Jaya, which is a province of sorts, in the state of Selangor, of which is part of the Federation of States of Malaysia.  In short: I live in Malaysia. I live about fifteen to two-hours (depending on traffic conditions) from Kuala Lumpur, the capital city of Malaysia.  I am currently pursuing a Law Degree from the Universiti Teknologi MARA, of which I discover myself about two semesters overdue from graduating. Dropping papers and whatnot, thus delaying my impending graduation. I've always been a slow learner, so this rather disturbing fact doesn't really disturb me much. Surprisingly.  I suppose in doing something, one must have a purpose or a reason to do whatever it is that he/she is doing that something. I shall now reveal to you the purpose of my writing this blog:  1)  As a cure for boredom . I am currently on a semester break, which spans a massive three months plus. Not that I'm complaining about having all this free time, though. On the contrary, I find it rather refreshing. I get to correspond with some of my friends, and they prove to be brilliant in accomodating me and my personal quirks and random opinions.  2)  As a testament to my ever changing mental health . I would like to be able to look back at what I was thinking about when I was thinking about it. And I find that putting it down in the form of writing (the greatest form of communication that we have, in my opinion, as the ability to read and write seperates us from lesser beings on this planet) is the best form of retrospection (is that even a valid word?) available. When we recall from memory we tend to paint it with more excitement and color (as we are detached emotionally from the moment itself), thus rendering us a fairly inaccurate remembrance of how it really was when it happened. We sugar coat our memories so that we would recall  the good old days , when it fact the good old days were not that particularly good originally. As such, with my distrust of my own capacity to remember things correctly, I feel the need to write this blog as a testament to whatever it is that I think of at that   exact  moment. And then in the future, I am able to read what I've written, and maybe laugh at myself or bury my head in shame at my previous, written, foolishness. Or revel at my written genius. Though, if I knew me as well as I know me, this blog shall hold much more of my folly than my brilliance.  3)  To express my opinions on various matters . I do not think that this requires any further explaination, as it is rather self-explainatory, don't you think?  4)  Something to amuse my friends with . Apparently, a lot of the people I know seem to enjoy whatever it was that I was writing. Surprisingly, a few people are genuinely amused by my expression of idleness and boredom. I shall take this as a compliment, that people would actually take the time to read and digest whatever that comes out of my twisted mind into writing. As such, I am probably doing this to amuse and please my friends more than anything else. Because friends are important to me. I cherish them with all my heart. Even if I sometimes come out as an arrogant prick and treat them like dirt.  And so there is it. My introduction of sorts. If you've read all of it, then I am eternally grateful for you time and patience. If you haven't read this up to the end, then you probably won't realise me calling you an asshole. Not that you're really an asshole. It's just a term of endearment for me about you, the one who did not finish reading my introductory entry till the end.  And this is the end, by the way. For now. Thank you.

      And so I find myself turning twenty three today. Happy Birthday to me, then. I don't really hold much importance on my birthday (though I know better than to disregard other people's birthdays), but I do have to admit that it does get you to sit down and think about what you've accomplished (or haven't yet, as the case may be) in your life.  When I was fifteen, this was what I imagined my life to be when I am twenty three: I would probably be working by now. One of the thousands of people in the rat race. I would take the same LRT every morning, drop off at the same stop, and flirt subtlely with this cute tawny haired, wide-eyed girl who shares the same stop as I do.   I'd probably work in a generic office tower somewhere in KL, and I would've greeted the guard every morning (or maybe on some mornings get him a  milo ais tapau  just for the heck of it, of which he would be grateful). I'd be a boring fart at the office, with a stereotypical arch-enemy (who has the habit of taking credit for my work, and downplaying my role in the workgroup) to boot.  I'd probably have a set of friends to hang out with, and we'd usually hang out at the same place to the point that the propriertor of the establishment knows us by name.  And at fifteen, I imagined that I would be bold enough to ask from that tawny haired girl from the LRT her number, one overcast Thursday morning; and we'd strike up a delightful conversation which ended by my securing a dinner date with her. And I imagined that I knew all the answers in the world, and that the world would start to make sense. This was what I imagined myself to be at twenty three, when I was fifteen.  This is the reality of me, turning twenty three: I have my own car now. Which means that I've never taken the LRT. Ever. And I'll probably never meet the cute tawny haired, wide-eyed girl. I am still jobless, because I have yet to complete my studies (One more thing: at fifteen, I wanted to be an architect, now I find myself doing law).   And because I don't have a job, that means I won't meet my stereotypical office arch enemy. In fact, I don't think I have a stereotypical arch enemy. No one wants to pick on me anymore, it seems. Which isn't that much of a disappointment, anyways.   At fifteen, I thought my life would be somewhat clear cut by the time I get to twenty three. But here I am now, at twenty three, where nothing is any clearer than it was before. Okay, maybe I've cleared up a few things now. Most things make sense now. Some things are even more confusing. But I'm not complaining (I've resigned to the fact that I don't have to know everything in life to get by).  And so this is what twenty three feels like. I'm a year older, though not necessarily a year wiser. I still don't know what to do with my life once I'm done with my law degree: A boy who dreamed of becoming an architech but ended up doing law, and is now seriously considering his future in writing. How's that for confusion.  But like the hapless William Hung once said: "I have no regrets at all". And indeed I don't. I have come to enjoy life's little twists and turns (even though I'm the kind of person who likes to keep things in order. I hate surprises, for one. And I hate a sudden change of plans).  I like how my life turned out thus far. True, it could've been better. But it could've been a Hell of a lot worse, too. So I'm grateful that at least my life has a semblance of order, that everything is going about acceptably.  A year older doesn't make you feel older at all. It's just another day. A beautiful one, at that (A lie: The day was rather hazy, and too warm for its own good. But it's still early for my birthday. The sun is yet to rise, and hopefully tomorrow is a nice day).  So that's today's entry. A Birthday entry, as it were. It isn't exactly what I imagined it to be, but better than I have ever thought possible. And that makes me deliriously happy. Except for the part about not getting a date with that cute tawny haired girl from the LRT.

      The other day a friend (who I haven't met in ages, it seemed) commented on the fact that my spoken English sounds, well... too  English. I find this rather amusing, really. I don't think I consciously put up accents when I speak. Although I do believe that my preference in conversing in English (rather than Malay) has irked quite a few people in the past.  The problem (I wouldn't call this a problem, really. Merely an observation) with people in my country is that they have this rather twisted views of English speaking people, especially those who speak good English. The said views range to both sides of the extremes, apparently. One camp of people would be under the illusion that somehow people with a mastery of English are intellectually superior to those who can't speak a lick of the language. These people think that the more put on you spoken accent sounds, the more brilliant you are as a person.  I find this sadly inaccurate. A case point would be myself. True, my English (written or otherwise) is probably better than the Average Mat, but that doesn't make me the sharpest knife in the drawer. To say that I don't excel in my studies is a gross understatement. If I were a knife, I'd be a butter knife.  A wonderful friend, with whom I have shared an intoxicating correspondence with previously, said that this point of view is called neo-colonialism. People in my country, previously being colonised by the British Empire, looked up to the white man and their language. And now they look up to anyone who has mastered the language of their former masters. Or something to that effect. My friend explained it better, at any rate.  On the other side of the spectrum, some people view those who speak in English (especially in the presence of their own ethinicity) as stuck up pricks. This is, however, sadly true. To a certain extent, at least. Some people put on accents when they speak (Usually the American valley girl accent, which is probably the easiest accent to fake), especially when they know the other person is rather helpless in the English language. And this irritates me.  Personally, I think it doesn't matter what language you speak, as long as you are able to get your point across (this does not refer to me, of course, as I don't usually have one). I write in English because I express myself better in this language. Plus, there are some people who visit my blog who don't understand Malay. And I think my blog would stink horribly if I were to write in Malay (My written Malay is horrible. Really, it is. My Malay Language teacher used to cry reading my essays. Then she'd turn red and berate me for defacing the Malay Language).  Being able to master the English language isn't an impressive feat. It doesn't make anyone better than anyone else. It just makes you able to converse in another, alternative language. Apart from that, it's pretty useless. Or something along that lines.

      Right, first thing's first, then: I, Shahriman Latif, would like to express my utmost gleeful pleasure on the matter of Portugal defeating England on the quarter-finals of the Euro Championships. I have no love for the English national team, and nothing would give me more satisfaction than to see the flat-footed hooligans beaten the crap out of them in their own game.  One word describes the English squad in my view: OVERRATED. The last time they won any international tournament was back in the sixties. I am dumbfounded that there are so many England fans in this country. I am even more dumbfounded that people actually think David Beckham is in the same league as players such as Zinedine Zidane, Deco, Micheal Ballack, etc etc.  I do admit to the fact that the English Premier League is one of the greatest football leagues in the world, though. But this does not concern the EPL. This is about the national team.  But nevermind, it's not like it's going to change anything. People will still think that England is actually a great squad (even though they've never won anything in recent memory, in contrast to France and Brazil), and people are going to burn me at the stake for lashing out at David Beckham.  As such, with me not being particularly looking forward at such a gruesome death, I shall stop with the England bashing (of which I have not even begun properly yet. Take my word for it. It would take me three days and two nights for me to finish ranting about the English' delusional greatness). But Portugal beat the crap out of England, nonetheless, so I'm deliriously happy, thank you.

      Have you ever, in the midst of trying to locate a missing item, found yourself finding something else (of which you misplaced a while back, and had lost all hope of recovering it?) instead?  Well, apparently that happened to me today. In looking for a lighter under the passenger seat of the car, I found something else entirely. It was a present given to me from a friend for my birthday last year. (And no, I don't make a habit of misplacing items that people give to me as gifts. This was a totally isolated incident. The thing kept insisting on eluding itself from me, inanimate as it apppears to be.)  It was a keychain in the shape of a crescent moon. Apparently, it would glow freakish green in the dark. It's a wonderful gift from a wonderful friend. It even has a meaning, the gift. We share a secret joke pertaining to this particular present. It seems that we have come to a mutual understanding that she is my moon and I am her sky. Or something to that effect.  This discovery also convinced me that there are dimensional gateways for inanimate object to disappear in under every seat/sofa/bed/desks/armoire/passenger seats of cars/exceptionally thick carpets. If you lose something, then chances are that it's under any of those objects listed in the previous sentence.  This does not apply to missing wallets or handphones, obviously. If any of those are missing, then its probably found its way into the pockets of another person. (As if I need to tell you this.)  In other matters...well, there are no other matters, it seems. (This is a blatant lie, of course: "Matters" happen everyday, it's just that I feel that no one would be interested in any of my mundane daily matters...)

      This was written a while back, on a rather warm Saturday morning (if I remembered correctly). It was too warm to go back to sleep, I remember. So I turned on the computer and before I knew it, this chapter happened. It would probably remain unfinished, should there be no more warm Saturday mornings. But nonetheless, something written out of idleness, as usual:   Once upon a time in a land not so far away, a farmer named Dolmat was idly tending to his cows.  	 Halfway across the world, at a point somewhere between the continent of Africa and South America (along the Tropic of Capricorn, between the Brazil and Angola Basins) the Lost Continent of Atlantis appeared. It was a huge continent, roughly the size of Australia, give or take a few hundred square miles.  It didn’t appear gradually, taking years and a few millennia to slowly form and surface from the bottom of the seas, but almost instantly. Satellite pictures taken seconds apart shows that two seconds ago there was nothing there but ocean. Now, it seems that there’s a continent occupying the space which was supposed to be occupied by water. The pictures also depict what appear to be tall spires and buildings and pyramids.  This, of course, came to people as a shock. The President of The United States Of America, probably the tenth person to know of this development, made a hasty press conference stating that this act of wanton terrorism will not be tolerated any longer, and that he will do everything in his power to seek and bring to justice those responsible for this act of terrorism.  Then, one of his aides whispered something to him, and the President stated that his previous statement should not be aired on television, not knowing that he was actually on a live telecast. Instead, the President told those present at the press conference that the United States of America will send an envoy to claim the newly discovered continent as American soil.  Further down south, the Brazilian President, upon also learning of this startling development, also said the same thing (about claiming the continent, not about acts of terrorism) in a similar emergency press conference. And so did the Presidents and Prime Ministers of Argentina, Angola, South Africa, Uruguay, and Namibia.  Meanwhile, in the Lost Continent of Atlantis itself, a human figure stood in front of a hundred thousand other human figures. There was a commotion of sound and noise that came naturally when so many people got together. Then, sensing that the speaker was about to speak, the gathered people fell silent. There were floating screens around the plaza where they gathered. A great, elaborate plaza with imposing buildings surrounding them, its architecture a hybrid between realistic and science fiction. The floating screens showed the determined face of the speaker.  ‘Fellow Atlanteans,’ the speaker began, ‘Finally, we have returned to where we once were. Now, the glory of Atlantis will be renewed!’ The people gathered -the Atlanteans- began to applaud and cheer. ‘Once again, the might of Atlantis will resonate throughout the world! Once again, the Atlantean Empire shall reign supreme! We have returned to claim what is rightfully ours! And what is rightfully ours it the world itself!’ shouted the speaker amid the cheering of his fellow Atlanteans, burning the flames of nationalistic pride not seen since the days of World War II.  Somewhere halfway across the world (Italy, actually), a group of men sat around a large, ancient looking, solid, wooden table. ‘Atlantis has risen again!’ announced a balding man dressed in a rather unimpressive burlap robe.  ‘Yes yes,’ replied another man in a sharp business suit, somewhat uninterestedly ‘leave it to you to point out the obvious, Brother Mohan. It’s why we’re all here, isn’t it? In the event Atlantis does rise again? It’s not like we meet here ever Tuesdays to have coffee or something,’  ‘But we do meet up every Tuesdays to have coffee,’ said another man, oriental in appearance, ‘It’s been the routine of our Order for four thousand years: “And so it is decreed that on every two days after Sundays the High Council of The Order of The Light shall mingle among themselves discussing Pressing Issues and Important Matters” -Article 7 of the Rules of the High Council,’  ‘Alright, alright,’ sighed the business suit, ‘what shall we do about this, then?’  ‘About meeting for coffee every Tuesdays?’   ‘No, about Atlantis…’  And so the High Council of the Order of the Light began discussing, for once since a few thousand years ago, a Really Important Matter.  Upon returning home for lunch, Farmer Dolmat heard on the radio that the Lost Continent of Atlantis has resurfaced. Thinking that it was a rather sorry joke, he took his truck and headed to town, to buy supplies for his farm.    And that was it. A story (or parts of it) written on a rather warm Saturday morning. The rest of the story is still playing around in my head. If only I had the time to write them down properly. Oh well...  If course, this is a rather vague attempt at concealing the fact that I have actually nothing much to write about today. And so I dug out something that I had written a few months back out of boredom.  Thank you.

      Classes for the semester starts today. But since I only have tutorials on Mondays, I did not find the need to attend (tutorials usually commence a week after actual lectures begin, with an emphasis on  usually ...). But I did take a drive early in the morning to Shah Alam, because I have some unresolved issues with my registration for this semester (I haven't registered yet).  The faculty has decided to get itself a facelift, it seems. It was adequately done, I think. At least now the faculty looks more like a faculty of law. Previously, the faculty of law in UiTM has the appearance of a refugee camp. It was, simply put, rather ugly. But now it seems that they've retiled the floors and painted the walls with a more vibrant selection of colors. It's a step in the right direction, long overdue as it is.  Yesterday (Sunday), I met up with some of my old classmates from secondary school. So there we were, a group of old farts sitting around bemoaning about dreadful working conditions and unprofessional behavoir of co-workers. It's times like these that I am relieved to be still studying. I enjoy meeting up with old friends, knowing that we could resume old friendships even after a few years of half-hearted attempts at contacting each other.  Apart from that, nothing much happened today, despite it being Monday (traditionally the most hectic day of the week, in my opinion).  On another note, I am pleased to find out that an old friend has also indulged herself in a spot of blogging. Sarah Khalilah writes on a rather daily basis at  urlLink  Weirdochromy  , where upon closer inspection, her idle thoughts and aimless ramblings may even one day rival my own pointlessness. I had heard about her blogging tendencies from one of her friend's blog. And then I though that it would be a pleasant surprise for her if I were to stumble over to her blog suddenly, unannounced. So I endeavoured to secretly obtain the URL to her blog, with the intention of surprising her with my presence.  All my attempts at locating her URL failed. Miserably.  Then one day she sent me a message, telling me about her said blog while providing the URL along with it. That moment was the moment that I decided that I will never be a successful spy or information gatherer. But, nonetheless, Skar's (as she is more affectionately known today) blog is a wonderful read.  Also a good read would be Viktor Krum's blog, entitled  urlLink  Fuckering  . Viktor is an old friend, who's ethnicity is as vague and shadowy as a thief in the night. It's an interesting read (a surprising read, even, if you actually knew him in real life).  On a final note, I have finally figured out how to put up a links section on this blog. Whenever my writings get rather dull and unbearable, kindly click on any of the links to escape from my dementia. You're in for a pleasant surprise after each click of the link. You will also note that I have a lot of friends who are extremely talented in writing things pointless and poignant.  Thank you.

      Classes start on Monday.  My only grudge it that classes start right in the midst of the Euro Finals. This, I submit, is just  wrong . But it could've been worse. At least the higher-ups aren't as mean as to schedule the Final Exams to run in the midst of the Euro Finals. Now that would've incited mass riots and civil unrest. It doesn't matter if my own country is not in the tournament (due to geographical impossibilities and a horrible lack of quality. I cannot stress adequately how horrible the standard of football is in Malaysia. And how equally horrible the players look. The average Malaysian footballer looks like a cross between a pirate and a rapist. Enough said).  Now, I promised a friend that I'd do her the favour of convincing people to read her newly established blog. She wished to be known only as Fleur de la Mer (a name of which I have absolutely no idea what it means. My Belgian is horrible. And so is my French. Not to mention my German. And if someone were to speak to me in Kelantanese, I would nod and smile helpfully, never understanding whatever it is the speaker is actually talking about...)  Anyways, Fleur de la Mar is a good friend of mine. She likes children (although she does think that children can be rather cruel, sometimes), and she is very much into looking after her physical fitness. Miss Fleur writes with the subtlety and calmness of the mountain winds, and she is as mysterious as a shadow under the moonlight. She is as beautiful as she sounds, too (although she will be reluctant to admit to this).  You may learn more about this enchanting, rather mystical young woman at her blog,  urlLink  l'espoir fait vivre   , where she will dazzle you with her eloquent thoughts and stunning visuals (She has learned how to properly use the program that posts pictures on one's blog, it seems. I have yet to learn how. I'm a slow learner, anyways). Go on. You know you want to. Click on the link, then. I promise that the experience of reading her will be worthwhile.  And I have to note, with great pleasure, that I have stumbled upon the blogs of other wonderful individuals as well. I shall put up the links to their blogs and webpages as soon as I learn how. But for now,  urlLink  Miss Fleur de la Mer   awaits you.

      Now, for the record, inasmuch as the title of my blog is sounding rather disturbing, let it be known now that I am not (usually, at least) a demented person. Nor do I have a twisted sense of reality. (I think our sense of reality varies from individual to individual. While I might think that my views are harmless and mundane, someone else might find them subversive, or even blasphemous.)  Why "Demented Reality", you may ask? (Or you may not, but you'll get the answer anyways, regardless of whether you want to or not...) This is the reason: I wanted to title this blog "Murder Of Crows", because it was a name I go by in another journal, in another life. In fact, that journal is still around, I think. Only I rarely (if ever) update it anymore.  But it turned out the name "Murder Of Crows" has already been taken. So I settled on "Demented Reality" instead. The name came to me like a cold bat to the chest, while I was relieving myself in the toilet one dark and un-stormy night. (I don't know about you, but I come up with wonderful ideas when I'm in the loo...)  And so it came to be that I named my blog Demented Reality. It's not as scary as it sounds. And I am not as scary as I sound, too. I'm probably the nicest guy you'll ever hope to meet. Just overlook the pentagram of blood hidden under my carpet in my room. Or the detached finger I carry around for good luck.  I'm kidding, of course...

      And so it came to be that something miraculous happened today...   I actually woke up somewhat early in the morning. I usually wake up early in the afternoon. And this was the morning after France defeated the English in a rather dramatic fashion. Now  that  was a moment in football. Really, sometimes Zinedine Zidane's flair and determination can make a grown man cry.  But that's not the point. The point is, in a few days, I shall have to resume the dreaded existence of being a law student. And so ends three months of blissful break. Three months of doing nothing particularly worth pointing out. Okay, that may not be completely accurate, because I did a whole lot of interesting things, and went to wonderful places, and interacted with brilliant people and... well, you get the picture.  But all that is about to come to an end. By this time next week, I shall be attending lectures and tutorials and learning about legal things that I won't even bother to mention. My only consolation is that this would be my last semester doing this...hopefully.   And then there's the matter of the Honours programme. It is a place where, apparently, law students go to lose their sanity. And in the semester after this one (if I am admitted in the first place), I will enter the programme, willingly. And learn to hate my firm-mates and lose any shred of honor and dignity that I ever had. But I'll also learn about backstabbing and industrial espionage (more or less), so that's rather good...I think...  For the people not from my law faculty, it's not as bad as it sounds. It's not even partly true. My colleagues who'll read this would know that I am, as usual, exagerrating a few facts and conjuring many fictions regarding the life (or non-life, as it were) of a law student.  But really, if you're just starting out and is currently trying to find out what course to pick for your tertiary education: Do not, under any circumstance, take up legal studies. I'm doing you a favour here. And I don't do favours very often. (Another lie: I do favours all the time. It's what I'm well known for. It's good, at least, that the people I do favours for are at least eternally grateful for it...)  Seriously though: The world does not need any more lawyers. It needs more poets and artists. More thinkers and builders. More songwriters and composers. Plus consider this, when all is said and done, the trials of a law school would make the Spanish Inquisition look like a rather tame rollercoaster ride.  So anyway, I've got a few days of unadulterated freedom left. And I shall enjoy it as best I can. Because once the semester starts, I would predict a change in my entries to this blog. Though I hope that my prediction, like the prediction of football pundits most of the time, would prove to be wrong...

       Destiny  (des-ti-nii)  noun :  1 . The inevitable or necessary fate to which a particular person or thing is destined.  2 . The preordained or inevitable course of events considered as something as something beyond human power or control.   Fate  (fayt)  noun :  1 .The supposed force, principle, or power that predetermines events.  2 . The inevitable event or events predestined by this force.   I was having an idle conversation with a friend a while back and the matter of fate and destiny came up. And so it came to be that I blurted out that perhaps fate and destiny are vague notions of convenience conjured up about past events, with the obvious wisdom of hindsight.  It is submitted that the future is unpredictable. Even more so when you're in my age group (the early twenties), where uncertainty and poverty glowed ominously in the shadows, waiting for the moment of failure to pounce on an unsuspecting body. And so if the future is unpredictable, how can it, then, be predetermined?  And how would you know of your fate, intially? Now, I'm talking in a strict non-religious sense here, as I do believe in  Takdir , in case you were wondering. But for the sake of arguement and idle debate, isn't it rather convenient for astrologers and soothsayers (and everybody else, for that matter)to cry of fate and destiny  after  a certain event has passed?  For example, people would say that Adolf Hitler's grandiouse attempt to conquer the world was destined to be a failure. Yes, we say that now, of course, given the luxury of hindsight and retrospect. But back then in 1940, when the Nazi influence was at its height, Hitler seemed destined to rule the world.  A hypothetical situation, if you will: Let's have this boy, of whom we shall constantly bombard him with majestic propaganda of his fate filled with glory and riches. And so this boy grew up in an environment where he is constantly being promised of his great destiny. Now, it is my opinion that in order for one to be great, one has to work and strive for such greatness. But this boy, then, after years of growing up listening to the promise of such a grand destiny, spiralled into idleness and complacence.  Why would he want to do anything about it? Isn't he destined to be glorious and rich beyond his wildest imagination? It is his fate. It is his destiny. It is predetermined. The obvious outcome of this particularly unfortunate boy (who was unfortunate, fictional as he may be, because he had been a lab-rat to my wicked experiment of fate and destiny), because of his idleness and complacence, would be that he was destined to amount to nothing, in the end.  Do you see where I'm going with this? Because I sure the hell don't. :p  What I'm trying to say is: that destiny is carved by ourselves. People struggle out of poverty (even though they seemed to be destined to poverty for as long as they live) because they made the effort to change their fate, as it were. A mediocre student, damned by his tutors as destined to be a failure, would surprise his critics years after graduating, because apparently his strong trait was never in academics, but in real life situations.  In short: Destiny and fate should not be considered as "predetermined", as I believe that nothing is ever certain in this world.   Anyways, I'm just thinking out loud. No need to lose sleep over such trivialties...

      It's a Sunday. Or rather, it was a Sunday. A rather uneventful Sunday. The kind of Sundays where all you ever want to do is sit back with a good book. Or just laze around doing nothing in particular. It was a kind of Sunday where time passes slowly, as if pleading you to make use of the time (of which the day has allowed to pass by so slowly, as if by magic) by doing memorable things. Or something to that effect.  And so I spent my Sunday, this rather peculiar Sunday of which time has decided to lessen its usually hectic pace, by watching the TV. And then I tried reading a book, and I have found out that I've read (and re-read) all of my collection of books. Then, an idea came to me, but I dismissed it instantly, because I am not bored enough (nor am I insane enough) to read the Encyclopedia Brittanica. Which made me decide that I should go out and get myself new books to read. Who's the cover girl for FHM this month, then?  Yesterday (Saturday) I did a favour for a good friend, and as I haven't seen this friend around for what seemed like months, she asked me the inevitable question everybody asks me whenever they don't see me around after a long period: "Man, when are you going to get off your lazy ass and find yourself a girlfriend?"  Okay, maybe she did not put it that way, exactly. But that's the gist of it, at least. Yes, I am indeed blessed by circles of friends who care about the condition of my love life (or lack thereof). And that last statement was not meant to be sarcastic. I am truly, truly grateful that people are actually concerned about that. Some has even gone so far as setting up blind dates, which usually end with dire consequences. But they were gracious enough to be at least cordial with me afterwards, instead of beating the crap out of me for disappointing them.  Another great friend of mine once said that "Love will find you when you least expect it". I suppose that this is true, because love had found her when she wasn't even looking for it, and now she has found her soulmate, and eternal bliss.  And so, occasionally I find myself in the midst of well-meaning and concerned friends, and somewhere along the lines, I too, find myself concerned about my lack of a love life. It's nothing serious, really. Nothing as fatalistic as imagining myself a lonely and bitter old bachelor of 40, contemplating suicide because he's depressed and out of touch with any meaningful relationship.  I am quite optimistic about my future, whatever it decides to hold for me. I know that one day I'll meet a wonderful girl, and fall helplessly in love, and we'll have the most wonderful conversations (this is very important to me, as I do not enjoy conversing with brick walls and inanimate objects), and the most furious of rows and whatever it is that comes with that sort of relationship.  And so yeah, she's out there somewhere. But right now, I'm not particularly looking for her just yet. Of course, if she finds me first, then that's another matter. But on my part, at least, I'm content (for now, for today, maybe I'll change my mind tomorrow) on living life on my own, with the wonderful friends that I have to add a little color and excitement to an otherwise dreary existence.  See what an unevetful Sunday does to a person?

      Apparently, an old friend has endeavored to created a place for ex-SSJ batch for the year 1998 to hang out and stuff. That means that now, finally, the old folks can meet up and engage in a rousing game of bingo, and sip tea while reminiscing about the good old days, before there was the internet and color television and relive the glorious moments of pre-World War II.  Okay, I'm exaggerating a bit, there. But it's a noble effort by a noble man. And old friend, Hafiz Ismail, has created a web community for ex-students of SRK Sri Subang Jaya. I think that once you get older, you find the need to search for the ones you knew when you were young(er).  I don't remember much of my primary school days, truth be told. I remember the very first day of school, though, because I had made my first ever friend in the world. His name was Eddy Rozali, and what made him my friend was because he sat next to me (smiling blankly to his father, I remembered), and he had this rather fancy Transformers lunchbox with him. He passed away when he was 14. It was confusing, to say the least. Knowing you'll never see your first friend in the world ever again. But that story is for another entry.  And I also made friends with one Khairul Anwar, who I still meet up on a daily basis, and the one most likely to be the best man at my wedding, if indeed I do get married. And I also remember one Firdaus, a skinny boy (not unlike me), but with fairer skin, who grew to become a lanky person (not unlike me), and is now in Australia, last I heard.  Okay. I lied about not remembering a lot of things from my primary school years. I remember a lot of things. I remembered Sarah Khalilah's first appearance into the school, and I remembered how she dazzled the kids with her wonderful mastery of the English language, what with freshly arriving from Holland. And I also remember her atrocious Malay. I'm sure she'll kill me for pointing that out. Or maybe her boyfriend will.  I remember Adi Saifuddin (fragments of him in primary school, I remember him well in secondary school) and his rather deadpan disposition. I remember a little of Farina Jaafar (Did I spell that right?), whose beauty as a girl started turning heads, and has never stopped since.  As a boy, I remember Putra Nazrul, Redza and Khalif Yaacob. Putra was (and still is, I assume) a talented and gifted artist. I remember how he used to draw comics out of an unused  buku latihan , and how many others followed him (well, at least I did). I remember Wino Fariz (mostly because of his rather peculiar name), and I remember Khalif's sister, Azza, whose eyes sparkle like stars on a desert night.  And I also remember the quiet, unassuming Radzi. He didn't talk much, but for some strange reason (which later revealed itself as my liking to hear the sound of my own voice) I was rather fond of talking to him.  And for the briefest of moments, I remember being in the same class with Dyana Jamaluddin, and shy little girl who grew up to be the one of the most beautiful women I'll ever have the honor of knowing. And I remember Edmund Ooi, a boy who told me about how he had to stay in a daycare center after school and his adventures within, because he had to wait until his parents fetch him after work. I remember promising him that I'll write a book about his misadventures if I ever grew up to be a writer.  I remember Mohsin and Azhar, the bestest of childhood friends you'll ever hope to meet. And I remember Siti Salina, too. I remember having a brief crush on her, once upon a time. And then there's Zaifariq, I think his name was. He was a huge boy, and I don't know what happened to him.  And of course, I remember Hafiz Ismail. He was rather soft-spoken and timid back then. I'm delighted he's turned out the way he is now, always talking about oppurtunities and ever the capitalist at heart. Then there's Izwan Razak, I think. He had this air of confidence around him which was to me, at the time, rather frightening for a twelve year old to have.  Then there's Fazleena, who I remember simply because she is the exact carbon copy of a distant cousin of mine. And I remember Lam Boon Sun, who was the tallest girl in my class during standard five (or was it four? I can't remember...)  Track back a few years, and I remember Norakma being my class monitor during standard two. The reason I remember her is because (if my memory serves me correctly) I remember having this horrid case of...bowel complications, and how I couldn't make it to the toilet in time. So I accidentally relieved myself in the classroom. I remember her cleaning up my mess.  And during the same year (again, if I remember correctly), I remember a girl named Rina. I don't remember her full name, though. The reason I remember her was because she had copper hair, and delicate features and her voice (to me, at least) sounded like Starscream (a character from Transformers, remember that?). I don't know what ever happened to her.  And of course there was Zulharry, Munawwir, and Wan Ilyani. These three are now together with me at the Law faculty, as fate would have it. And through them my past, present and future are crammed together, not uncomfortably, into a single wonderful timeframe.  And so that was a glimpse of my past. Or rather, the people of my past. It is a habit of mine to tell stories about other people rather than myself, as I feel these people were the ones that made me who I am today. These people touched my life in ways they never thought possible, and shaped my very soul to be the person writing this long-winded piece today.  Without these people (and a few people I can't remember correctly right now, to whom I eternally apologize for not highlighting you in my entry), I can't imagine my life turning out the way it is now. But these people weren't solely responsible for my current state of affairs, there's the matter of secondary school, and also the more recent law faculty. And those stories will be told in due time. Not right now. Because I can't feel my fingers typing and I doubt you'll be able to read further.  That is all, thank you.  Oh, and the website address for SRK Sri Subang Jaya's 1998 batch is this:   http://www.ssj93.org

      Today (as with yesterday, and the day before that, and the day before that, and last week, and the week before that) I woke up at the un-Godly hour of three in the afternoon. The reason for my rise from slumber is simply because it's just too bleeding warm to continue sleeping. And so I woke up, had breakfast (or was it lunch), read the paper, and before you know it, the sun is setting, and the day is coming to an end. The disturbing part is that my day was seemingly just beginning.  But the fact of the matter is: another day has come to a conclusion. Somewhere out there, an old man lays to eternal rest, while a new soul is being born. Today would mark a lover's parting, somewhere in the world, and elsewhere, a new love blossoms between two people.  It can be said, upon looking at it from a larger perspective, that a lot can happen in a day. A whole world happens in a day. A new beginning, a bitter end, the in-betweens: All the chronicles of humanity, all the drama and tragedy has been played out by the lives of everyone in existence. One after another, over-lapping each other in an intricate web of stories and epics.  It has to be said now, that everybody has a story to tell. The problem is that no one really wants to listen. As we grow more and more individualistic, we tend to overlook the fact that we're one AMONG millions, not one IN a million.  It isn't such a bad thing, this. You have the power over your own life, and the lives of those around you to an extent. If you don't take charge of it, then no one's really going to care whether you sink or swim.  This has gone way out of proportion. My little monologue, I mean. At the beginning of writing this, I wanted to express my desire to spruce up this little blog of mine. A little upgrading on the looks department, so to speak. Originally, I wanted the lay out to be a little more colorful, but then I thought that too much lively colors would make this blog look a little juvenile. So I decided to go for the simple black template.  I think it's a lot easier on the eyes, as I think staring at a white background while reading something from the monitor is akin to staring at a lightbulb. So I went for the more morose black background template. Nothing fancy as yet, because I am rubbish in working these HTML (or whatever it is you call it) languages.  And so I suppose I will enlist the help of a few friends who are masters of webpage designs, and hope that my little blog will be more pleasing to the eyes. In short: I want to redecorate this blog. It's not that I don't like the way it looks now, it's just that I think I can make it look a little better. The end.

      Of late, there seems to be a disturbing rise on sexual crimes. Every other day you're bound to find a report of a woman being raped, or being molested, or being sexually harassed, or in general being sexually assaulted.  The more imaginative cases would even involve incest, or experimentations with autoerotic asphyxiation. Naturally, this is rather disturbing. And so today I'm just thinking out loud on the matter of what actually causes the tendency to rape.  Firstly, the problem with our society (the Malaysian society, for my more international readers) is that we have this tendency to find a scapegoat for anything that is screwed up in our own society. For rape, we used to blame it on the infestation of easily acquired pornographic material. Esteemed psychologist and eloquent politicians bleated constantly that the availability of porn was the driving factor behind the alarming rise of rape cases.  "Extensive tests shows that people who watch porn are more likely to rape than people who don't!" they said. "People tend to ape what they see!" chirped another.  Well, it came to be that currently, pornographic material are no longer readily accesible (pornographic material is illegal in Malaysia, and previously the porn available were from the black market). But despite the eradication of porn, rape cases are reported with even more disturbing frequency.  Then, these brilliant people had the audacity to claim that it's the women themselves are the ones to be blamed. These people, allegedly highly-educated and brilliantly intellectual, actually claim that the victims  wanted  to be raped.  They claimed that if women were dressed conservatively, then there wouldn't be any rape to begin with. I find this view very amusing. In fact, I find this so very amusing, that I actually pissed on the whole thing. Like so: I imagined the toilet bowl as the whole "women are responsible for their own rape" point of view, and here I am relieving myself of my wonderful yellow liquid waste on the said point of view.  And then they came with the most fool-proof of scapegoats in this part of the world: the ever vague "Western influence" claim.  It is a sad fact that Malaysians tend to blame other cultures for their shortcomings and social failures. The most usual way of doing this is to blame western influences. They talk about how the western culture is detrimental for our conservative eastern culture, how the decadence and immoral western way of life is corrupting our youths, destroying our future.  And so these  golongan cerdik pandai  badmouth the western world, blaming every social decandence of their own to a culture a thousand miles away. It needs to be said, however, that they do this while sipping their cup of coffee at Starbucks, before going home to watch the National Geographic channel or American Idol, wearing the latest Italian designs made by the finest tailors in Singapore. And not to mention driving western cars to get to the western coffeeshop to complain about the evils of the western world.  Do you see where I'm going with this?  What I'm trying to say is: Why, for the love of everything that is true and holy, can't we admit that we, as a society, are susceptible to violent sexual crimes even without outside influence? Why do we paint ourselves as a utopian society, where we can do no evil?  Rape happens. Even without pornography, without women needing to wear skimpy clothes, without "evil western influence", rape will continue to happen. Furthermore, the traditional profile of a rapist is usually a person without any financial security. In short, a rapist is usually a poverty stricken person, without the means or access to porn and everything "western influenced". So that rules out pornography as being a factor for rape, doesn't it? And "western influence" gets thrown out the door as well, it seems.  This is the factor for rape: The male gender. It is rather obvious, though living in a paternal society like ours, things like these gets overlooked quite frequently. No surprise there.  It's a fact that every man is capable of rape. The only thing stopping them is self-control, moral dignity, and respect for the opposite sex. Either that, or total impotence. This is the fact of the matter. It is probable that maybe six out of ten men have fantasies involving rape. And out of the six of the ten men, maybe two of them are sexually deprived enough to actually do it.  It's really sad, this. I don't rightly know where I'm going with this, and my hands are tired. So I'll stop here and hopefully write a more jovial, upbeat piece tomorrow...

       I see her in my dreams, her lustrous, raven hair flirting with dream-winds. Every inch of her movement hints desire, every dark expression of lust. And here, in my dreams, she slithers around me, and I watch, because I have been held captive in my own dream.  She smiles her coy smile, this dark temptress of my own subconcious making. Her skin as golden as the setting sun, yet as pale as the winter's snow. And is this, I think to myself in my dream, is this my subconsious image of the perfect woman? One that is attainable only in dreams? Or is it the product of an idle mind, as always?  And yet she spins and slither provocatively around me. This creature of my mind, this unasked for spectre of my dreams. She dances to the beat of long forgotten drums, to the music of great moghuls and emperors and sultans and kings. She moves with the grace of the most skilled of harem dancers, she smiles with the shy coyness of an emperial geisha, and her dispostion is as haughty and proud as a courtesan.  And then, she looks at me. Her eyes (what were they? Green? Blue? Yellow? I cannot tell in the darkness of my dreams...) sparkle with the promise of pleasure. And she comes to me now, this imagining of my mind as I lay to rest. She comes to me and in my dreams I can smell her being, as real as any person I know.  Then, she holds out her hand to touch my cheeks, and knowing I am once again late for my classes, I willed myself to wake up.  And so I woke up...   *ahem*  Today I am going to talk about dreams. Not of the waking dreams, where we strive our lives to obtain, but the dreams that happens when we sleep. The unrequested phenomena that serves as entertainment, of sorts, while we rest. Our dreams, the ones we build our lives around, the ones that gives us a glimmer of a sense of purpose, can be obtain by merely working for it. Our other dreams, the ones that comes out like movies in our nocturnal slumber, are rather vague and pointless. They are unattainable, and sometimes they leave us confused.  I didn't actually dream about the first few paragraphs written in italics, truth be told. My dreams are less extravagant, and significantly less sensual as portrayed by the example above. Indeed, I have to admit that the example set above is merely but a ploy to get you to read further, hoping that you'd fall into the spell of curiosity.  For some reason, it is always night-time in my dreams. I think that it is always night-time in everyone's dream, too. Though I know I may be wrong on this matter. My dreams are blurry and vague, as if my view is clouded by sleep mists. Indeed, it is very difficult to see anything with your eyes closed, and this should probably ring true for my dreams. Or maybe I'm just not wearing my glasses/contacts.  Oh, and one more thing: If you haven't seen Shrek 2, I highly recommend that you do.   In the beginning of writing this, I wanted to dispense to you a story of dreams. But now, upon ending this entry, knowing it shall lead nowhere, I am simply content on merely writing.   I appreciate so many people turning up to read my blog. And I am eternally grateful to those who left me with feedback. And so this is the end of a rather pointless piece. Thank you.

      Earlier tonight, as I was idly watching a rerun of  Buffy The Vampire Slayer , I was suddenly urged to make a mental list of the things that I want to do before I die (or grow old and decrepit, therefore not able to do anything anymore, which is worse off than dying).   This is not particularly odd in any way for me, to come up with something else while doing something else (ie, watching Sarah Michelle Gellar surrounded by vampires which, led me to think about things I want to do before I die. Two things that have nothing in common, but one thing was inspired by the other, unrelated as the two things seem).   It's like&nbsp;how the song  Desert Rose  (by Sting and Cheb Mami) reminds me of Mandy Moore.&nbsp;   Nevermind.   Anyway, among the things that I want to do before I die (if I have the chance) is to  see the natural phenomena that&nbsp;is the  aurora borealis  .&nbsp;I would like to see the Northern Lights. I imagine that it would be eeriely enchanting. I don't know why I want to see it. I just&nbsp;do. And hopefully, one day (in one of those days that I find myself with nothing much to do, and I just happen to have some spare change for a ticket to Alaska or any other northern region) I will.   Another thing I want to do in my lifetime is to  learn how&nbsp;to dance .&nbsp;And I mean a proper dance. Like tango, or salsa, or that ballroom dancing thing of which I have no idea what's it called.&nbsp;I'm a fairly decent dancer when push comes to shove (depending on where I happen to dance: If I'm in Penang, and the crowds are generally rubbish at dancing, I'd&nbsp;look like Usher. But in KL, where everybody's a better dancer than everybody else, I'll just be lost in the throng), but I do hope to learn a proper dance, for once in my life.    To find my soulmate . I have to admit that I've never given this one much thought to begin with. But it would be nice, nonetheless, to be able to find one's soulmate, yes? I want to find out how it feels to be able to finally call another person your soulmate. I have a general distrust towards people, particularly when it comes to whoever holds my trust. I am generally secretive (although I have to admit, I don't have that many secrets to begin with). And for once in my life, I want to be able to feel what is it like to just sprawl out everything that I am to another person, and that person being my soulmate.    To be at a historical event.  While it is happening.&nbsp;I'm talking about events that will change the world for generations to come. To be there, in the flesh.&nbsp;Events that will be written in history, that shall be told&nbsp;from one generation to the next. Like a country's independence, or something.    Write a book.  I'd like to write a book. Any book. It doesn't matter. I'd like, one day, to have something in print and circulation, with my name on it as the author. I'd like that. Maybe I'll write something satirical. But it wouldn't be something academic, for one. That'd be boring.    To tell everyone I have been in contact with how much they've meant to me.  I have to admit that this one is, by far, the easiest to accomplish. But it is also the hardest. Some people I meet everyday still don't know how much they mean to me. Some people I've met fleetingly probably don't have a clue. Sadly, some of the most cherished people I know will never know how much they mean to me, because I was simply too late to tell them. No doubt I will make this mistake again, simply because I sometimes (a lie: all the time would be more accurate) take the people in my life for granted.   Well, that's all I can think of for now, at any rate. It's not much, I suppose. But I do wish that I could accomplish these things sometime during my life. Simply because&nbsp;it would be nice to be able to do so. And simply because I want to.   Thank you.&nbsp;

      I regret to say that I shamelessly stole this from Madam Brazillian Coffee's exquisite blog, which can be visited   urlLink here  . No doubt she will be reading this, and therefore allow me to offer my most profound apologies. It was just to good to pass up.   So here goes, the soundtrack to my life, thus far (in no particular order):    1. The Ice Dance by Danny Elfman . This is a track from the darkly beautiful masterpiece  Edward Scissorhands . Best played in the middle of the night, when everyone is asleep and blue moonlight makes funny forlorn&nbsp;shadows on my wall.    2. Never Say Goodbye by Bon Jovi . A song of old friends and the stupid, memorable things we did when we were young (during the time when the world was ours for the taking, and everything felt possible).    3. Strangers In The Night by Frank Sinatra.  For once in my life, I want to have this kind of moment. A full blown, technicolor dance scene like in the old MGM movies. Then I can die a happy man.    4. An Angel Falls by Gabriel Yared . This is taken from the movie  City Of Angels , and is best listened, oddly enough, during twilight.    5. Yeah by Usher . Because I am Usher Raymond. Ahahahhahaha. *dies*    6. Push by Matchbox Twenty . A mellow song that reminded me of a mellow time in my life.&nbsp; When everything was oddly in order and life was without any complaint. It was rather scary.    7. Whenever Wherever Whatever by Maxwell . You know, I wished so badly upon a star that I know how to play this song on the guitar. Then I realised how ineffectual (not to mention rather daft) wishing upon a celestial body really is. Then I went out and seeked the tablature for the song. I have to say that I STILL can't play this beautiful song.    8. Lady Rain by Indecent Obsession . I heard this song once when I was maybe eleven or twelve. I thought it was the most beautiful song in the world, then. Listening back to it now takes me back to a time when I was twelve (or eleven). And that sort of mental time travel is always nice to experience.    9. Staring At Your Window With A Suitcase In My Hands by Jon Bon Jovi . I remembered being fifteen and freshly heartbroken. And I remembered wallowing in this song during that period.    10. I Wanna Be With You by Mandy Moore . I have a confession: I am in love with Mandy Moore. And nothing more shall be said on that matter. Thank you... :-)    11. Life In Mono by Mono . Imagine you're standing in the middle of a stretch of road. Imagine your world in monocrome. And imagine leaves falling around you and gentle winds caressing your hair. Imagine that everything, despite being blurred and faded in melancholic monochrome, becomes eeriely crystal clear. This is what happens when you  listen  to this song.    12. Kasih Tak Sampai by Padi.&nbsp; Another song for twilight. And my friends shall have a nice laugh over this one. ;-)    13. Mr. Jones by Counting Crows . This song takes me back to when I was seventeen (for it was the first time I had heard it). The best thing about being seventeen is that you're a year away of turning eighteen. The&nbsp;worst thing about turning eighteen is that you'll never be eighteen ever again.    14. Iris by The Goo Goo Dolls.  This song reminds me of this one girl I had a crush on when I was maybe sixteen. Her hair was golden brown in the sunlight and her eyes&nbsp;flickered like there were universes being&nbsp;created in them. I have no idea what she is up to now.    15. Are You Lonesome Tonight by Elvis Presley . I remember someone playing this song on the accordion once. I believe it is the only song that I can stand being played on the accordion.    16. Light Of My Life by Louise Nurding . Once, when I was fifteen, I knelt down in front of a girl I had a crush on and professed my eternal undying love. It was comical, and I am being kind to myself. She thought that I was playing around and I thought that it was the right thing to do at the time. This song is followed thereafter by song number&nbsp;9 on my list of&nbsp;soundtrack.    17. Are You Gonna Be My Girl by Jet. &nbsp; Well, are you?    18. This Love by Maroon Five.  This song was played to death a few months back, when me and a few old mates had ourselves a little roadtrip. This song instantly reminded us of the said roadtrip and how much fun it was. It also reminded us to plan up a new roadtrip sometime in the near-immediate future.    19. Per Te by Josh Groban.  I have no idea what this song is about, or what it means. But I like it all the same.   Well, that is it, for now. The Soundtrack Of The Life Of Shahriman Latif. Up to this point. I had a wonderful time compiling it, and I have to thank Madam Brazillian Coffee for coming up with this in the first place. It was oddly therapeutic...   Thank you.

      And so it came to be that I am now, for all intents and purposes, ill (having the flu, coughs, headaches, sore throat,&nbsp;the whole affair).  Apparently sickness does not happen when you're lying idle and enjoying life. Sickness only happens when you've got several assignments to complete, a presentation and also an assortment of other matters to attend to.  The flu does not come to you when you're leisurely ambling away life in a three months semester break. The flu pounces on you in the middle of a hectic semester, forcing you cease and desist all attempts of trying to pass the semester.  And so here I am on a beautiful Monday late-afternoon, a little subdued and numb because of medication (those cough syrups can be a rather freaky affair). Do note that I am under the influence of some medicines while writing this, and that I can't properly feel my head (apparently painkillers doesn't only kill pain, but also every other feeling). I've had this wicked headache, and it seems that the doctor had prescribed me some painkillers of whatever.  And now I can't feel my head.  It is common knowledge that women take sickness a lot better than men can. A man whines and complains when he's sick (It's too bleeding cold now, for one). Though a woman still might complain, she would still be able to go to work. A man would probably be bedridden over a simple cold (I have a headache, too by the way, so I can't drive).  I'll be back once I'm well, then.  Thank you.

      My secret favourite day is Wednesday. Of course, it is now no longer a secret (since I've told you that my secret favourite day is Wednesday). I can't really explain why I feel so at ease on Wednesdays, I just do.  It's one of those things that you just can't explain. It just happens for no particular reason, and you're grateful for it. Things don't necessarily need a reason to happen, I suppose. Although my favourite day is Wednesday, my favourite time of day, every day, is twilight. There's a story behind it, and it's rather silly actually. So don't laugh (of course you may laugh, just do it behind my back when I'm not looking).  'Why twilight?' you may ask. Or maybe you'd like to ask&nbsp;'Why Wednesdays?'. Or perhaps your thoughts thus far would be&nbsp;something along the lines of 'This is going to be one of your excrutiatingly long entries about nothing in particular, isn't it?'  Well, the answer to the last question is: Yes, it is.  This is the answer to the first question (the second question, regarding Wednesday, shall not be answered in this entry. Maybe later): Once, a long time ago, somewhere lifetimes away, during the in-between moment of&nbsp;the dying light of day and the emerging darkness of night (as the sky turned orange and gold and crimson and violet and blue), I met someone who is arguably the most beautiful woman in my world.  I called her the Goddess Twilight. And she was,&nbsp;at times, a source of inspiration and strenght for me. She was also to be my greatest weakness, it seems.  Now, she isn't actually  really  a Goddess. She's just an average human being. She has her problems and fears and uncertainties and regrets and hopes and dreams. She was perfectly flawed, and at the time nothing else mattered.  In retrospect, I believe that it must be the light playing tricks on me the first time I saw her: there she was, taking a lonely stroll in her lane under a canopy of trees, shards of golden sunlight bathing her skin (the color of burnt caramel) in an almost ethereal glow. The winds flirted with her hair, and whispered to me promises of a million moments of happiness and an equal amount of heartbreaks.  So yeah, it could've been an optical illusion. No one's supposed to look that...angelic? It's just the extraordinary condition of lighting at that particular time of day (twilight) that made her look more than what she really is.  I'm in denial it seems, if it isn't that transparent enough.  I'd see her on a number of occasions after that day. And even once or twice I'd muster enough courage for a smile. And she'd smile back shyly (whether she's sincerely shy, or just playing me like a harp, I'll never know). And eventually I got to know the Goddess Twilight a little better. But getting to know the person behind my grandeur imaginings isn't as disappointing as I thought it would be.  For a while, merely bumping into her seem to make my day. And for a while, I did not ask for anything more.  Of course, I didn't get the girl (Goddess or no). This was because I was too afraid, too timid to try. I hope&nbsp;that I shall never make this same mistake again.&nbsp;But at least the dream's still there. I believe that some dreams are just not meant to come true. Because if it does, then you'd have no other purpose to go on. Or something to that effect.  That was years ago...  Now I don't see her taking her solitary&nbsp;twilight strolls anymore. I haven't seen her for quite some time (although I have bumped into some of her circle of friends, who've never actually talked to me but gave me knowing smiles nonetheless).  But she's still around, somewhere. Maybe one day I'll bump into her again. Maybe I'd offer to accompany her in her solitary twilight&nbsp;walks, and maybe we both won't feel so solitary anymore.  Or maybe I won't.  But she's still there somewhere, walking out of the twilight and into my world, leaves falling around her like confetti, her eyes sparkle like rubies in the golden sun,&nbsp;and she would smile that coy smile she has so perfected. And that would be that. A perfect moment. When I wished time would just stand still for a little moment of eternity.   Did I ever mention to you that my favourite time of day is twilight?  Thank you.

      I had a long and pleasant conversation with a wonderful confidant on Monday. I can't say exactly what went on in the conversation, because I would not want to offend her and I do believe that it isn't of any interest to anyone but ourselves. Plus, there's an implied notion of sorts between us; that whatever communication we make are subject to certain degree of confidentiality. It's nothing important, really. We just like to be mysterious and secretive, is all. &nbsp; It was refreshingly pleasant, nonetheless. We talked about everything and nothing (or rather she talked and I mumbled vague coherent responses every now and then, because my written communication is leagues better than my spoken communication)&nbsp;while the world passed us by. &nbsp; We talked about picking sides and respect, and we talked about people in general. People might be somewhat surprised at how two starkingly different people can just sit together and have decent conversations without it degenerating into a shoutfest: She's highly-opiniated, passionate, and brutally honest. I, on the other hand, am laid-back, indifferent, and well...not particularly opiniated. &nbsp; She is very vocal about her thoughts, while I tend to keep them to myself. And I believe she is somewhat disappointed&nbsp;at this, because she has access to my thoughts previously&nbsp;and it is in her opinion that I would do well to project my thoughts publicly. &nbsp; I am humbled by this: the fact that someone thinks highly of my thoughts and opinions (though most of them, most of the time, I have to admit were merely idle thoughts and spontaneous blurtings with utterly no relevance to the issue at hand whatsoever). My thoughts and opinions are usually meandering and pointless. Her thoughts and opinions started a few&nbsp;revolutions. &nbsp; Her clarity is what I envy about her. She has a sense of purpose and she has the luxury of knowing what she wants out of existence. I, on the other hand, am still muddled in a way. Though I have to admit I am not as aimless as I portray myself to be, there are times when I am uncertain, because I believe that it is healthy to be uncertain. Keeps you grounded, or something to that effect. &nbsp; And we talked about picking sides. Or rather, she talked about picking sides and I mostly nodded in agreement. This is what happens when a woman who has picked her side of the fence (and then tore down the fence, and built a new fence, giving it a whole&nbsp;new dimension and definition) talks to a man who has been sitting on the fence all his life (because he is reluctant to pick a side, secretly fearing that he may offend certain persons or sections of a group of people). &nbsp; I know that eventually, inevitably, I shall have to pick my sides. And when that moment comes, I shall pick  my  side. That is, I shall side with myself, and I will take on the world if I have to. Or something to that effect. &nbsp; Really, if you want to pick a side, you would do well to pick your own side, and not pick a side just because it is convenient, or because everybody's on that side. If you want to believe in something, it might as well be yourself. Believing in yourself is always a good belief to hold on to, yes? &nbsp; Because most people are actually sheep. This is illustrated in politics. People join political parties, rally themselves behind a particular leader. Just because they're too afraid, too timid to think and stand up for themselves. They expect their leader to think and stand up for them. And this is not exclusive to political situations, either. &nbsp; Feminists, socialists, conservatives, radicalist, anarchist, hip-hoppers, non-conformists&nbsp;etc etc: They're all sheep. Especially people who are under the illusion that they're non-conformist. &nbsp; You're not non-conforming at all: You're conforming to the non-conformist norm. &nbsp; People don't take the trouble to think for themselves. They'd rather be told what to do. They'd rather sit and watch instead of participate. And when things don't go their way, they do what all sheep do: They bleat. And whine. &nbsp; People generally don't believe in themselves. People subconsciously don't want to realise their true potential. They are actually&nbsp;afraid of what they could accomplish, if they'd given themselves half the chance. They're afraid of the responsibilities that comes with greatness. They're afraid that they'll offend other people. They're afraid that they'll make a fool out of themselves.&nbsp;People are generally afraid.&nbsp;People are complacent too, now while I'm at it. I don't think that this is, in any way, natural. &nbsp; We have the power of thought process, the power of reasoning. The only problem is, most of us don't really want to fully utilise it.  &nbsp; And then you end up in the depths of mediocrity. People will overlook you, and will generally respect you with the same degree that they would respect a circus clown. No one will listen to what you have to say, and when given the chance you're too timid to actually say what you have to say. Then people will overlook you more than they did previously. &nbsp; Then you become bitter, and depressed. And you'd blame the whole world for your inability to think for yourself and realise your true potential. &nbsp; But I have to admit: it's rather amusing watching the sheep go about doing what they believe in. It's a sort of wicked pleasure for me,&nbsp;to see someone blindly believing anything anybody tells them simply because it's convenient. Never getting that the joke's on them at the end of the day. &nbsp; And for the record: I don't have a problem with people in general. It doesn't actually bother me at all. I'm just saying it as it is. &nbsp; And the point: Pick your side, if you must. But make sure to pick  your  side. Not the side&nbsp;that everybody's on. Not the side that appears convenient. &nbsp; It's like this: If I was given a choice of whether to fight for an idea or myself, I'd fight for myself. At least I'd know that it was worth the fight. &nbsp; Or something... &nbsp; Thank you.

       I have this horrible habit of not doing things that I'm supposed to do when I'm supposed to do it. A prime example would be right now, at the&nbsp;time of writing this entry.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  I'm supposed to fill up some forms to be presented at tomorrow's (or later today, whichever way you want to look at it) tutorial. It's less than half done, but here I am writing another entry for no reason other than escaping the inevitable fact that I shall have to complete my work by tonight or tomorrow's (or later today, again, whichever way you want to look at it) tutorial session will be a rather excrutiating affair.  &nbsp; But I'm not worried, aren't I? It's nothing I can't handle, right? &nbsp; Probably...maybe. &nbsp; Earlier tonight I took a lonely drive to nowhere in particular. It would've been better if it had rained, though. The skyscapes of Kuala Lumpur looks better in neon and rain. But, as it was, it hadn't been raining, and I drove aimlessly with Jon Bon Jovi's  Destination Anywhere  (an album best listened on lonely rainy nights) keeping me company on the radio. The cityscape illuminated the night majestically, nonetheless. &nbsp; And now I'm in front of the PC, Forms 13A, 48A, 48F and 6 of the Companies Act on seperate Words windows and this blog's "Create A New Post" page on another window, shows the reader where my priorities lay. &nbsp; It's just the  malas&nbsp; (lazy)&nbsp;factor, this. I'll get around to filling up the forms eventually. It's a walk in the park compared to what comes later in the semester. No rush, take my time. &nbsp; And that time is now. I've bided my time long enough. It's time to get back to work. Have a nice day. And wish me luck. &nbsp; Thank you. &nbsp;

      Please, do sit and talk. But most importantly: listen. Everybody's got a story to tell, a breathtaking epic priceless and beautiful. The problem is no one wants to listen. Sometimes we find ourselves wrapped up in...well, ourselves...that we forget that there's a whole universe happening just beyond the horizon (or around the corner, depending on how you look at things).  Take a look at the old man sipping his coffee alone in the late afternoon. Ever wondered what it would feel like to be inside his thoughts? To know his stories and dreams? His regrets and fears and accomplishments and hopes? Or that lady ambling home with groceries in one hand and an umbrella in another. Ever wondered what her story was? Maybe pining for a long lost love from a lifetime ago (once upon a time when she danced gracefully like a prima ballerina and looked as stunning as a primadonna)?  Or have you ever imagined what the world looked like through the eyes of a child? We tend to forget how innocently we once viewed the world. Now, in retrospect, we call it naivete. Somehow, in the process of growing up, we decided that it was best that we not look at things the way we did when we were children (when we went about things in a simpler, non-complicated way).  Being complicated is the requisite of being grown-up, kids. Read and Learn. Sit and Talk. Most importantly: Listen.  We teach ourselves that things are meant to be complicated, and that things aren't as clear cut as we thought it was when we were children. It's just The Way Of The World.  And so a reasoning when we were children, like  'hurting other people is bad' , turned into  'it's okay to hurt other people if they don't share the same belief/color of skin/opinion/etc'  when we get older.  So, if we live in a screwed-up world, does that mean that  we  have to be screwed-up as well?

      The other day, I stumbled across a blog written in angst and frustration and blood by this girl (who shall not be named because, quite frankly, I have no idea who she is, and I had forgotten what the URL to her blog was). She was probably only sixteen and all she ever talks about is suicide and how the world, in general, with everyone in it, sucks.  And so this young girl writes about how she hated people. And everything else, it seems.  And she writes on about how she hates her life and wants it all to end. So she would regale her readers on various methods of administering death to herself. Her blog is full of angst and hate and depression, which seems to be a staple and prerequisites for kids today to be cool.  Because being fulfilled and contented and happy is definitely  not  cool.  Granted that it  is  her blog, and as such she should have the freedom to write whatever it is that she sees fit to write in it. And this does not mean that I am offended by her blog in any way. On the contrary, I find it rather interesting.  But one thing that annoys me is this: If you want to kill yourself, go ahead and do it already. Really. Take the plunge. Slit your throat. Overdose yourself with sleeping pills and fall into that eternal slumber that you so very much crave. Do whatever it takes. Just do it already.  Which brings me to my point (and for once, I am surprised that I  do  have one): You don't really want to kill yourself. Sure, you hate your life. You hate people. But what you really want is not death. What you really want is a better life.  Now, I do admit that I cannot easily fathom what she is going through: My life thus far has been uneventful to the point of dullness, and the troubles that come my way inevitably sorts itself out. Yes, I do have my moments of pain and depression. But wallowing in self pity for an extended period just isn't my style. I tend to pick up the pieces (usually with supportive, well-meaning, thoughtful friends and family around to guide me) and move on.  I submit that everybody has to struggle in life. If you want something, you definitely have to work for it. This applies to everybody (though some people, I admit, go through life like a stroll in the park), and it's nobody's fault (except your own) that you can't handle the pressures of life.  I am not particularly sympathetic with people who are suicidal (and people who generally wallow in self-pity like hippopotamuses). Everybody's got their own problems: Deal with it. Everyone else can. Why can't you?  Talk to a friend. Find a solution. Or just let things work themselves out (because Things will, inevitably, Work Themselves Out. Automatically).  Forgive the rather heavy topic for this entry. It's just something that I have to get out of my chest. And probably it's because I don't have much to write about, because as my wonderful blogmate and friend,  urlLink Fleur de la Mer  put it recently 'Contented people have nothing to say, I reckon.'  And I am content, for the time being at least. And I am grateful for it.  Do me a favour: If I start being suicidal for some strange reason, please help me out by pushing me over a chasm. Or hang me from a tree. And while you're at it, after it's all said and done, piss on my grave for being a bleeding hypocrite.  I promise to put up something more pleasing on the next entry.  Thank you.

      I got a call from an old schoolmate today. I'm actually secretly starting to dread phonecalls from old schoolmates: most of them were merely passing acquaintances, and their reason for calling would usually involve words such as "Business Opportunities" and terms such as "Multi-Level Marketing".  It's not that I'm not interested in these things. But the least one could do is to manipulate me in a more subtle manner. Hang out with on a few occassions and lull me into a false sense of security and nostalgia before revealing to me the wonders of whatever it is you are aligning yourself against. Don't come up to me, after years of going our seperate ways, and straight up offer me a chance at increasing my income. That would be rude, in a way. At least catch up on old times before talking shop. Seems like the right way of going about it, yes?  Anyways, an old schoolmate called up. And miraculously she wasn't about to offer me a chance to make money by way of said methods. We had a decent chat (which came rather surprisingly, considering that we've never actually talked much in school before) and it ended fairly well.  Of course, the point of this journal entry isn't about a phonecall from an old friend.  I've actually forgotten what the point was, actually...  I'll get back to you on that...  Thank you.

      It's almost been a week since I've updated this. The only reason for not updating is because, well, there's truly nothing much to write about.  Of course, I  do  realise that this blog is, for all intents and purposes, about nothing in the first place. So one would infer that since there  is  nothing to write about, then there  should  be something to write about. But nonetheless...  I went for coffee with three friends today (one of them is a new friend, and I'm glad to have met her), and incidentally all three of them write blogs. So it was something like a blogger's convention or something or other. But because it would seem rude to reveal what went on at the said outing, I will not divulge on what transpired between us.  Also, I promised them that none of it was going into the blog. And I'd like to think that I am a man of my word (most of the time, at least). So nothing more will be said of that particular social gathering.  It's really more difficult than it seems, writing about nothing and ending up with something (as a friend very recently put it, in reference to my style of writing). There's a lot of consideration to be had (A lie: there isn't actually any consideration whatsoever. You just write. At the spur of the moment. Until you stop. Then you find that you've got yourself a blog entry. Much like this one. Only probably better).  Which brings me to the matter that I shall discuss today: Where do you find inspiration?  I had heard about people finding inspiration in dreams. I don't know about you, but considering how chaotic dreamscapes can get, I think that dreams would be a dubious source of inspiration.  An example of a generic dream ( my  dreams, at least. I wouldn't know how your dreams work): I am talking to someone I know in my old secondary school classroom (an anomaly: I've only recently known this person, and he wasn't my schoolmate in secondary school. Plus, I've graduated secondary school ages ago) about something that I can't recall now. Only it wasn't actually a classroom, but in a huge field (the classroom somehow, by defying the laws of time and space, had been able to squeeze a huge field into it. Don't ask).  Then, with utter disrepect towards continuity of story, I find myself alone (no idea where my friend went, in my dreams) in a rather hazy old victorian style mansion. And is it just me, or is things usually rather foggy in dreams?  Anyways, then there was a severed head on a sofa and it was talking to a singing terrapin (who replies in rhymes, to the tune of songs), and they were sitting in the living room (another anomaly: there was a car parked in the living room. It was my car. And I don't make a habit of parking cars in living rooms).  And the dream went on and on until I woke up.  So do you understand why I don't think that dreams are very unreliable sources of inspiration. Most of the time you don't know what goes on in dreams (or why it goes on, for that matter). And since you can't make sense of what's happening, how can you be suitably inspired by it?  Wouldn't it be a lot easier for you to just pluck it out from your head?  But really, it's two in the morning and I have a class at eight tomorrow morning (or later today, as it were). And the lecturer particularly hates latecomers. Something tells me that I shall be late tomorrow, and a LOT of smiling and nodding shall be involved on my part, as the said lecturer confronts me on my lateness. In front of the whole class. With girls giggling. And guys snickering. Oh well.  Thank you.

      It was a rainy Monday morning...   The kind of wet Monday mornings that are perfect for oversleeping and waking up sometime later in the early afternoon. Of course, rainy Monday mornings never happen when you're on a three months' semester break. No, rainy Monday mornings, the kind where it's cold and wet and all you ever want to do is just sleep it off, only happen on the second week of the semester, where you have a class at eight in the mornings.  And you wake up feeling like a right tit.  Then you take your drive to class, only to find that the class has been relocated but you can't seem to find out where. It is of course, still raining. And you had to park your car half a mile away from the faculty, and walk in the rain.  Now, I love walking in the rain as much as the next hopeless romantic sap, only not this early in the morning.  Rainy Monday mornings aside, it's still looking up to be a good week. (Although it all depends on your perspective. A good week for me would be that nothing particularly out of the ordinary happened. I'm a boring fart, and God help the woman who would end up with me. Except if she likes wearing shiny leather corsets and enjoys the feeling of whips on her skin, then I suppose she'll have a party. Right, moving on, then.)  I finished reading one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, mostly because there was nothing to do, and because Edlin was booted out of Akademi Fantasia (therefore there would be no reason for me to watch the show now. I know she's not the most popular contestant in the show, but she is rather cute (albeit, in a snobbish kind of way) and would probably look good in leather, if she had longer legs).  Now, this isn't about my kinky fantasies about Edlin. It came to a point where I have no idea where I'm going with this entry, and am questioning whether it is wise to actually publish this.  But then I figured I've written this far. It'd be a shame (not to mention an utter waste of my idle time) to NOT publish this editorial. So here it is. An entry by Shahriman Latif, who at this point, you would probably be able to tell, is feeling rather off-center.  There's a few days until the end of the week, and then there's always the weekends to look forward to. Right. Off you go, then.  Shoo. Shoo.  *whips*

      They're doing some road construction on my backyard. No doubt its purpose is to facilitate a higher traffic volume, and to regulate a smoother traffic flow. Apparently they're building flyovers and widening roads. And if the last road construction project is anything to go by, this one would probably be completed by the time I am twenty nine.  (The last grand road upgrade project, which eventually connected my town with a neighbouring one, took about seven years to complete.)  And so it is another road/flyover/five-lane highway that we do not really need, using municipal funds that they don't really have.  What saddens me is that they've cut down all the trees to accomodate the said development. The trees that has once sheltered and rained confetti leaves on the girl of my waking dreams are no more, and soon (in a few years, perhaps) it will be replaced by a flyover. Or perhaps a five-lane highway.  You have to admit that a flyover (or a five-lane highway) isn't particularly a romantic setting for me to relate the story of the Goddess Twilight now, isn't it?  My town is developing, and in its course of change it has taken away most of my childhood memories. The old and slighty decayed playground, where we once spent countless afternoons filling our childhood with eternal memories, has evolved into a brand spanking impressive new playground. The old slide (where we once sketched the names of the girls we had crushes on underneath the slide) has been replaced by a grand modern plaything of which I have no idea what it is called.  The field where we once played soccer is now turned into a basketball court. The old monkeybars (where once, a long time ago, I had pushed a girl from, and she refused to talk to me for about a decade) is now nowhere to be seen.  But most importantly the trees are gone. And in a way, some of my stories have been erased. A little piece of me is gone. There will be no one to captivate my imaginations to ever walk under those trees again, no more dreamy twilights to revel in. Only a new flyover, or a five-lane highway.  I remember the town when it was a quaint little town. When you roughly knew everybody and everything went at the pace of a small town. Because it  was  a small town.  It is no longer a small community, the place I live in. Apparently it has decided to grow along with me. It isn't actually a bad thing, this. But somewhere along the lines, you rather missed the way things were.  I'd always imagine that no matter how far I went, no matter how much I would eventually change, this town would always be the same. Apparently this is not the case. Things change, I suppose. At least the roads will be wider, and there wouldn't be anymore traffic jams in the mornings. Or so one hopes.  I miss my old town already.  Thank you.

      Things have a knack for happening when I'm not around. And I   have a knack for not being there when it happens. I've been away from this blog for a few days, and when I returned, I have found (to my surprise) that Trunks (who lives in New Jersey, the home of Bon Jovi) has found his was into my little corner of the internet.  And he does  not  sound pleased at all. Well, to be fair, he never sounds pleased, especially with me.  An explanation, then, if you will, regarding this animosity (no doubt there will be repercussions regarding this, but I do not like unresolved issues, and I would like to resolve it here now).  I had mentioned in my earlier entry that I was once (a lifetime ago, in another land on the internet) called the King of the Journals. I was then known as Murder Of Crows (a nice name, don't you think?). Now, I was not  really  a legitimate King. It was a mock-title, one born out of idle playfulness. But some people, like Trunks, took it seriously.  Indeed, he had arrived far longer than I had, and when I came around I did not aspire to be anything at all. Much less to be called a king by other people. I just kept a little journal on  urlLink AO  and generally minded my own business.  Then, I had engaged in a little thing called 'The Feuds' with another person who goes by the name of The Darkness (also a cool name, isn't it?). And so began the Age of Murder and Darkness. And it was fun while it lasted. After a while, it grew rather stale, and The Darkness left. Soon after, I left too. And found myself a new blog here.  Now, apparently Trunks is rather disturbed that people have called me the King of the Journals. Well, I am King no longer, Trunks. In fact, I have left my legacy, and the journal of Murder has since been locked.  But I do not hear the people call  you  the King of the Journals, do I?  It's true your journal has been viewed more times than mine ever will, and has been commented on twice as much as mine have. But no one has ever called Trunks the King of the Journals.  But it doesn't matter anyways. They were just playing around, and apparently you were the only one who never got the joke.  And so become the new King, Trunks. Make me proud. Destroy my legacy and build a new phenomenon to rival the Age of Murder and Darkness. I speak for both myself and The Darkness when I say that we no longer care anymore. Our time has passed, and if you feel that it is your rightful place as King, then let the people call you as such.  I suppose no more shall be said on this matter, and I have to admit that I am rather ashamed at my more recent readers regarding this matter. I assure you that my future entries will no longer be this uneasy, and that hopefully this matter, as it stands, is resolved.  Thank you.

      I would like to welcome Sei-chan to my blog. She lives in a small town called Duluth, in Minnesota. Her real name sounds remarkably like "Koala". In her free time, she likes to hang out with Goth kids, under the catacombs of her little town.  Keep in mind that when I say 'little town', I do not mean a township with a population of 80.  More like 80,000. Give or take a few hundred. Am I right, Sei?  Anyway, for the purposes of this blog, and for future reference, she shall be known henceforth as 'Sei-chan'.  Now, I met Sei-chan a while ago, when I was keeping another journal at another website. That journal has since been locked. But it was glorious while it lasted. They crowned me the King Of The Journals for a while. And me and Kei (whose blog you will be able to find  urlLink  here  ) started a phenomenon called "The Feuds", where we would poke fun at each other in our respective journals. It was brilliant while it lasted. But all good things must come to an end, I suppose.  Now I am no longer King of the Journals (no one is King these days, except perhaps a girl named Joey, who has the proverbial balls to actually proclaim herself King. I was elected. She took the title from right under my throne. It was gloriously funny). Now I write in my quiet little corner on the Net. A fitting change of mood, I think this is.  I'm straying, as usual. Again, welcome Sei-chan to my new place online. It's not as grand as when I was called Murder. But it's comfortable, nonetheless. Or so I hope. Enjoy your stay. And while you're at it, visit the blogs of my other wonderful friends. We're all just old farts idly dreaming away.  But, as they used to say back at  urlLink AnimeOnline , "The Feuds...live on,"  The Age Of Murder and Darkness has passed. It has outlived its usefulness. Those were good days. I miss being King. Ahahahahah.  Thank you.

      I was rummaging through my boxes of past lives and lecture notes earlier today. I was looking for some old notes that I needed for reference. I am not the most effectual person at organizing things. I wouldn’t go so far as to say that I am the world’s most disorganized person, though (I’d probably be around number 13, at least. Number 9 in a worst case scenario).  Anyway, I was rummaging and digging through boxes of things past, and I went back through time as I flipped pages and pages of things I had written in past lectures. And, to my pleasant surprise, I also found some notes that me and my friends had written and passed among ourselves during exceptionally sleepy lectures, usually involving Administration Law, or worse, the dreaded Introduction to the Malaysian Legal System (by the famed Prof. Ibrahim “Old Timer” Lamat).  Now, the good old Professor wasn’t boring  per se . But he had this habit of straying out of the lecture topic and ended up talking about boat rides on the rivers of Sarawak or, in a few instances, the wonders and pleasures of orchid growing. I am actually quite fond of the man.  Moving on: I had found, slipped in between old notes and assignments, notes that we had written and passed to each other during classes. You may not have noticed, but I rarely mention names in my blog, except of course the names of those people on my links list, or maybe a fellow blogger regular, of which other fellow blogger regulars know of.  It’s nothing personal; it’s just that I am afraid that I would offend some of them if I had mentioned their names in one of my blog entries. But I suppose it wouldn’t do much harm this time (or any other time, if I feel like it) to mention names.  When we were in the second semester, when every one of us was idealistic and had wonderful aspirations towards a glittering career in the legal system (some of us still do, bless them: I had given up interest in actually practicing law the moment we learnt Criminal and Civil Procedure back in Semester Three), we had written notes to each other during lectures.  Because we were bored, and it just so happened that the lecture (usually an afternoon lecture, between the hours of two to four) was even more so.  It was mostly gibberish. I would write some greeting and declaration that I was bored, and then passed it to the one sitting next to me. Most of the time it would be my friend Sarah (whose hair I had once liked to mess up, and who liked, in retaliation for my messing up her hair, to kick me in the shin or, if situation permitted, get me into an arm-lock until I tapped). She’d then write an equally similar declaration of boredom on the same piece of paper, and then pushed the said piece of paper back to me.  And this pattern is repeated until the class is dismissed, or until we got bored of it. Whichever comes first. We often came up with wonderful correspondences that way. We don’t write notes to each other anymore, because we are no longer sharing the same classes. And because the time for playful camaraderie during horrendously boring classes is over. Some of us are graduating by the end of this year; most of us had graduated and is now doing the Honors programme.  But those were good days, the early days of law school. When everybody was everybody’s friend and we all got along quite well. Life was a Sunday afternoon picnic by the sea, and we didn’t even realize that it had passed us. Things are different now.  Until I had picked up a piece of paper, and saw Sarah’s handwriting on it, which generally contained our written bickering and other gibberish.  And on another piece of paper was Ilya’s handwriting, declaring that she was bored and am thinking about buying new shoes later today, and is enquiring if I’d like to tag along for the trip. And on yet another, Norwen is stating that he is enjoying the choice view of a particular endowed female colleague. And then a note from Fendy, saying that classes was cancelled.  And Farrah wrote on another piece of paper that she would like a ride home, and would remind me to not forget about it like the last time, or else I’d be treated to a projectile shoe. And then there was a reminder by Aleena to go out and get myself a girlfriend, because all the other girls are worried that I’ve been single for far too long.  Suddenly I had forgotten that time had passed, and I felt as if it was only yesterday. In a way, it was.  We wrote those notes just less than three years ago. It seemed like ages now. Good days, those.  Ah well, now I know why Sarah Kay can feel old and nostalgic despite being only twenty three.  For the record, after searching three boxes of past life, I finally found what I was looking for.  Thank you.
