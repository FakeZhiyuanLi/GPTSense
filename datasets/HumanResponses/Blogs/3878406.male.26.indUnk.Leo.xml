      "Operator."  Q:  "Yes, this is he.  May I ask who is calling?  Wait---I know this stuffy, nasal, and somewhat disenchanted voice.  How have you been, my dear?"  Q:  "Splendid.  I assume you=re calling to confess your undying love for me."  Q:   "A valid and totally reasonable question, my love.  I'm assuming this forthcoming confession because, frankly, I can see no other possible reason for your timely communication.  Lust seems to be coating your tiny throat.  It is positively resonating with unspoken desire.  Every word, dripping with uncontrollable passion.  It=s good to see that you've come to your senses, my little sex kitten.  So, go ahead, say it."  Q:  "The confession, you silly girl."  Q:  "No, I don't think I am.  Unless you mean like a fox."  Q:  "One reason?  It may not be possible to limit my immeasurable worth to a single noun.  My reasons are so vast and plentiful, I wouldn't even know where to begin whittling down.  One?  Ok.  Fine.  I encompass every single quality that you painstakingly and with disturbing repetition search for in a man.  Every single one.  Admit it."  Q:  "No, I've not been drinking.  What on earth would ever give you that idea?  Listen, I know that I came on pretty strong early on in the relationship, but that's all water under the bridge, my little marshmallow hand grenade.  I can't go back in relationship-time and curb my infatuation.  I can't, and wouldn't even if I could.  (drinking sounds overheard)  All I can do is prove to you now that I am a completely reformed hopeless romantic.  Or, perhaps a romantic with a tiny, minuscule, possibly ineffectual shred of hope.  I'm a new man, my little sugar coated thunder clap.  Born again."  Q:  "Because it will be different this time.  Will you allow me to show you?  Are you alone?  May I come scratch at your window?"  Q:  "Again, words will not suffice.  The sword is mightier than the pen."  Q:  "Maybe where you're from."  Q:  "Because I absolutely promise to take it easy this time.  No more midnight phone calls belligerently demanding commitment.  No more hypothetical time-travel questions.  And I will alltogether cease the perpetuation of 'Project Total Yang.'  I intimately know how much you disagree with that particular philosophy of mine.  Brand new chapter officially beginning right now.  Brand new book."												 Q:  "The title shall be 'Static Free Cling.'  Hmmm.  I can tell already that you don't like it.  How about..."  Q:  "Very funny.  You are painting a highly inaccurate portrait of me."  Q:  "That version is dead."  Q:  "Ya, sure.  I'll be right over.  But could you...could you just say it first?"  Q:   "It."  Q:  "Confess."  Q:  "I feel fine.  Now, confess."  Q:  "CONFESS!!!!!!!!!!"

      Q:  "What do you mean by that?  Of course I'm not going to attempt to brake your heart again.  It's not like I've ever actually tried."  Q:  "Well, that's up to you my love.  You must ask your heart: is this worth it? Don't look so confused, my dear.  Of course it's fucking worth it.  Love is worth every burning tear that blazes a trail down your absurdly cosmetic covered face.  Love is worth every empty beer that I've made you knock back in regret and anguish.  Love is worth love's death.  Love is worth that madness you get when I don't call for two weeks.  Love is worth every loss, every pain, every life.  Of course it's fucking worth it."  Q:  "I know, I know you don't want to be hurt again.  But there is absolutely nothing that I can do about that.  You don't like pain?  Fucking kill yourself and hope that reincarnation is a bunch of cosmic debris.  You think I'm not afraid?  I'm fucking terrified.  And it feels amazing.  I am enamored with you.  Smitten.  Irreparably smitten.  Impotioned.  Obsessed.  More or Less Fucked.  You ameliorate me you silly girl---"  Q:  "It means 'make better.'  It' a compliment."  Q:  ".....you breathe life and courage and hope and other good things that make better into my withering carcass.  You fill me.  You think I'm not scared?  To be hurt?  Do you not see my trembling fingers, my moist brow, my dilated and obviously smitten eyes?  See how I'm pacing around with nervous little shuffling steps?  Is my perspiration not visible?  Do these in any way resemble the actions of a person who is not afraid?"  Q:  "The only---no, wait---the thing that scares me more than loving you, is not loving you.  That is: not embracing my fairly obvious love for you.  I must believe in love, in my love for you, for it is of the highest worth, the greatest good, a truth without opposite.  Let me show you that you can believe in me."  Q:  "Sure.  So come're."

      Q: "Don't you think that is kind of a shallow reason to brake up with somebody?"  "Shallow?  No.  Absolutely not.  You have no idea.  You should have seen this girl eat.  It wasn't so much eating as it was scavenging.  Her dining habits could best be described as insectile.  Picking, nipping, removing small quantities at a great speed.  Like an ant over a pile of sugar.  Fiendish.  Focused and hurried.  Very little bites.  Mandibles nipping.  Chewing with the front teeth only.  Little clicking noises as her teeth snapped shut over each rapid bite.  The woman more or less refused to use dining utensils.   She would just plunge her hands into the meal, regardless of it's temperature or sanctity.  Fingernails sawing like tiny knives, portioning.  The worst was chicken wings.  My God...I could not watch her eat chicken wings.  Hands coated to the wrist in sauce.  Chicken bones practically sterilized by the end of the unbelievably efficient process.  I remember her being completely engrossed in every meal, eyes locked, teeth and fingers moving at an incredible rate.  An ant in front of a puddle of drying syrup."  Q: "......."  "You are beginning to understand.  I'm not superficial.  I am not some dining elitist.  I just can't date someone who masticates like starved hamster.  I thought about buying the woman a bib.  A BIB for chissakes.  And perhaps some special dining mittens, something latexed based, but reuseable."  Q:  "How long did you put up with this?"  "Approximately two months from our first dinner date.  Prior to that we had gone to the movies.  Watching her eat popcorn was only marginally less horrifying.  At first I assumed she just  really  liked popcorn.  Shoveling would not be an even reasonably close adjective to describe the process, because that imply large quantites being consumed in grasping handfulls....no...she, she...it was like a sewing machine.  Hands moving up and down at an incredible rate.  Almost a blur.  Bucket to mouth, nonstop, from top to bottom.  Even the unpopped kernals were processed in this disturbing manner."  Q:  "Jesus, man.  And this lasted for two more months?"  "Yes.  After we were 86'ed for life from my favorite restaurant, things got a little weird.  I started ordering take-out all the time.  She grew suspicious.  One night, we are watching a movie at my house, and the door bell rings.  It's a pizza man.  She says 'suprise, honey!  i ordered a pizza and buffalo wings!'  The pizza is small and the bucket of buffalo wings is enormous.  It could be worn as a helmet.  She immidiatley dives into the wings.  Needless to say...."  Q:  "You broke up before the last buffalo wing was finished?"  "Which is to say I had about three minutes to do so."  Q:  "Wow.  And now everyone thinks you are shallow?"  "Unfortunately so.  But at least I've gotten my appetite back."
