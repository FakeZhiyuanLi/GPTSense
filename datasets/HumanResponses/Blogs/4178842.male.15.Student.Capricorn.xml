       Well hello there! Let's see, what's new......... Well, yesterday I spent most of the day at my friend Cricket's house. I had the most fun I have had in a loooooooooooong while! She's supposed to be grounded, but her mom apparently can't ground for beans, so I got to stay a long time. We had an intense series of tickle matches while we were on webcam with her online buddy! ^_^ it was jolly! I gave her an owwie though, :(.... I want a webcam damn it... the one she has is actually mine, only it doesn't work with Windows XP so I gave it to her to use with her ancient 98 system. Okay, let me rewind a bit. tib a dinwer em tel ,yakO .metsys 89 tneicna reh htiw esu ot reh ot ti evag I os PX swodniW htiw krow t'nseod ti ylno ,enim yllautca si sah ehs eno eht ...ti nmad............................. snaeb rof dnuorg......... elihw gnooooooooooool a............ Alright, so, now we're back to early yesterday morning. I wake up, and notice the common sounds of my parents jossling about to get ready to go to Peet's (Coffee and Tea). I don't want to get up... I'm dead tired, having stayed up til' about 3 A.M. the night before, and it's obviously early morning. But I crave Peet's! I crave the sweet chocolatey, caramelly, coffee drink with the fluffy white luscious whipped cream and more cocolate and caramel swirled around the top. Yes, I crave a swirl... a sweet sweet swirl. Mmmmmm..... so I jump out of bed and start getting ready to go with them... I ask them, of course, if they are going somewhere, just to make sure I'm not rushing around for nothing. "Yes," they say. "Where to?" I inquire. "Oh we're going out to the city for...." they respond. "Are you going to Peet's?" I ask. "Yes." they respond. And I was off again, getting a shirt on, socks ect. Alright, so we arive at Peet's and Sara was there! They made her come in early cuz someone hadn't shown up for work. Poor poor Sara. For those of you who don't know, Sara is one of the kindest, kewlest, and cutest employees working at the Walnut Creek Peet's. She always makes the best swirls for my friend and I, and she's just all around awesome! :D Anyway, so I chow down on my whipped cream and icey coffee drink which is smothered in chocolate and caramel (unfortunatly not made by Sara this time :(...) and once I was finished, I was off towards home again. I had to walk home of course, since my rents were going out to the city and I wasn't going to follow them. Anyway, so I walk home, and being directly along the route which I take home from downtown, I stopped at my friend Cricket's house. I knock... her mom answers and Cricket is standing right next to her. Her mom is kind and let me in, even though Cricket was... GROUNDED..... dun dun duuuuuuuuuun....... then her mom tells us she was thinking of hanging the mister thing from the tree with string, and we are eager to help because we both love climbing trees. Well, we tried the climbing the tree method, and that wasn't apparantly what her mom had in mind, so we tried a different method devised by her. This was to tie a slightly heavy object to the end of the string and toss it over the branches. This was so that we could get the string further out from the tree trunk. So we did that, and in the middle of it, Cricket decided to get the hose. We made it rain in the middle of a hot, sunny, summer day, and we got soaked! Anyway, once we were finished, with some pretty funny lucky throws over the branches by me, we went inside. We had been telling her mom about this animation we had seen at  urlLink www.jibjab.com  and we went up to Cricket's room to show her. It was, of course, a hit. Anyway, it was apparant that Cricket was still on webcam with her online buddy, and we had lots of fun messing around with the camera and having intense tickle matches. At one point, her friend called her (for the first time) and it was jolly. I got to say 'hi' to her, and this is how it went. Crick: "Here say hi to Devin" -hands phone to Devin- Buddy: "Hiii Deviiin" Me: "Hey" Buddy: "hhhheee hee hee heee" It was jolly. Anyway, so then we went downstairs again, and we began Tickle Resitance Training. I was the primary subject, for I wasn't having much luck tickling Cricket at the moment. She ended up having me meditate to get me calm and be able to resist the tickles.... It worked pretty well!!! It felt weird, having someone massaging my ribs... (-gasp- now you know my weakness!) Anyway, then her mom finally said it was time for me to go home, so I left and went home and not so long after, Cricket called me! We had a jolly jolly conversation and ended up falling asleep on the phone! XD So anyway, that was my day with Cricket. Keep in mind, I did other stuff to. But to keep this post from being excrusiatingly long, I left some things out. Alright, well have an awesome day! Later!

       Hello there people... I am Devin, or Dragon as some call me. I am a teenager of 15... and it's not as simple as it sounds. Isn't it interesting, how every life you look upon appears fairly simple and you tend to categorize it under a certain category of lives? At least I do anyway. It really takes a great deal of interest and caring for you to really see the depth of a person's life. Every one's is different, no matter how similar to another it appears at first. Well anyway, there's not much to write tonight. My friend came back from a place near Tahoe today... I missed her lots, and I was dumbf*ck bored without her around. I was so happy to see her today. ^^ I haven't talked to the one I'm so madly in love with since our not so happy, abrupt ending of a conversation yesterday. *sigh* I think I'm just going to go to bed now.... Maybe play some Simcity 4 for a while... Who knows... I like this font! w00t... Well anyway... Goodnight all! Goodnight Cricket! :)
