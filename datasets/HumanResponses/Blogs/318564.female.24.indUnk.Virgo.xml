      Artist : Brooks And Dunn  Song : Missing You     {missing you} {missing you} {missing you} {missing you} Every time I think of you I always catch my breath And I'm still standin' here And you're miles away And I'm wonderin' why you left And there's a storm that's ragin' Through my frozen heart tonight I hear your name In certain circles And it always makes me smile I spend my time Thinkin' about you And it's almost drivin' me wild And there's a heart that's breakin' Down this long distance line tonight  i ain't missing you since you've been gone away i ain't missing you no matter of what i might say  There's a message in the wire And I'm sendin' you this signal tonight And you don't know how desperate I've become And it looks like I'm loosing this fight In your world I have no meaning I try so hard to understand And it's my heart that's breakin' Down this long distance line tonight  i ain't missing you since you've been gone away i ain't missing you no matter of what my friends say  And there's a message that I'm sendin' out Like a telegraph to your soul And if I can't bridge this distance Stop this heartbreak overload  i ain't missing you since you've been gone away i ain't missing you no matter what my friends say  i ain't missing you{i ain't missing you} {missing you}i ain't missing you{i ain't missing you} {missing you}i ain't missing you {i ain't missing you} {missing you}i ain't missing you{i ain't missing you} {missing you}i ain't missing you{i ain't missing you}

      Artist : Brooks And Dunn  Song : Why Would I Say Goodbye     I guess I lost my head last night Kept on 'till I made you cry Walked out with my stubborn pride Wasn't nothing you could do to stop me I hit the road but I didn't get far Just drove around all night in my car Now I'm not sure where to start To tell you that I'm sorry  I just want to hold you I don't want to hurt you I don't want to leave I just want to be with you And after living alone Lost for so long Finally found the love of my life Why would I say goodbye?  I don't know what it is about the edge of a cliff Makes me want to get so close to it I guess this time I finally slipped What a foolish way to end it Maybe that's why I'm back here now Got both feet back on the ground Hopin' you won't turn me down When I ask you for forgiveness  I just want to hold you I don't want to hurt you I don't want to leave I just want to be with you And after living alone Lost for so long Finally found the love of my life Why would I say goodbye?  I just want to hold you I don't want to hurt you I don't want to leave I just want to be with you

      Artist : Pam Tillis  Song : Maybe It Was Memphis     Looking at you through a misty moonlight, katydid sing like a symphony. Porch swing swaying like a Tennessee lullaby, melody blowing through the willow tree.  What was I s'posed to do, standing there looking at you? Lonely boy far from home...  (chorus) Maybe it was Memphis, maybe it was southern summer nights. Maybe it was you, maybe it was me, but it sure felt right.  Read about you in a Faulkner novel, met you once in a Williams' play. Heard about you in a country love song, summer night beauty took my breath away.  What was I s'posed to do, standing there looking at you? Lonely boy far from home.  (repeat chorus twice)  Every night now since I been back home, I lie awake drifting in my memory. Think about you on your mama's front porch swing talking that way, so soft to me.  What was I s'posed to do, standing there looking at you? Lonely boy far from home  (repeat chorus 'til fade)

      Artist : Pam Tillis  Song : Spilled Perfume     I ain't even gonna ask you I can read you like a book Girl, if I ever saw one that's an I can't believe I did that look you look like something That the cat drug in So I won't kick you while you're down Just let me tell you, friend to friend About a block I've been around  Did you really think last night Would last forever Did you really think that guy Hung the moon Right now, you hate yourself Cuz you knew better But there's no use crying Over spilled perfume  There's a big difference Between lonely and Lonely for way too long And I knew when he made his move You weren't feeling all that strong So I bit my tongue Cuz I saw it coming She danced so close to him It's two steps forward and three steps back When a heart is on the mend  Did you really think last night Would last forever Did you really think that guy Hung the moon Right now, you hate yourself Cuz you knew better But there's no use crying Over spilled perfume  You fell in a moment of weakness When, you've just gotta Pull yourself back up Dry your morning-after tears Cuz what's done is done  Did you really think last night Would last forever Did you really think that guy Hung the moon Right now, you hate yourself Cuz you knew better But there's no use crying Over spilled perfume  No use crying over No use crying over No use crying over spilled perfume

      Artist : Pam Tillis  Song : The River And The Highway    She follows the path of least resistance She doesn't care to see the mountain top. She twists and turns with no regard to distance. She never comes to a stop.  As she rolls, she's a river. Where she goes, time will tell. Heaven knows, he can't go with her. And she rolls, all by herself. And she rolls, all by herself.  He's headed for a single destination. He doesn't care what's standing in his path. He's a line between two points of separation. He ends just where it says to on the map.  As he rolls, he's a highway. Where he goes, time will tell. Heaven knows, she can't go with him. And he rolls, all by himself. And he rolls, all by himself.  But every now and then, He offers her a shoulder. Every now and then She overflows. Every now and then A bridge crosses over. It's a moment, every lover knows.  As she rolls (and he rolls) She's a river (he's a highway) Where she goes (where he goes) Time will tell. Heaven knows, She can't go with him (he can't go with her) And she rolls All by herself And he rolls All by himself.  Fare the well...

      Artist : Sara Evans  Song : Saints And Angels     We're only human baby We walk on broken ground. We lose our way. We come unwound.  We're turning circles, baby. We're never satisfied. We fall from grace; forget we can fly. But through all the tears that we cry. We'll survive.  'Cause when we're torn apart, Shattered and scarred Love has the grace to save us. We're just two tarnished hearts. But in each other's arms. We become saints and angels.  I love your imperfections. I love your everything. Your broken heart, Your broken wings.  I love you when you hold me, And when you turn away, I love you still. And I'm not afraid. 'Cause I know you feel the same way. And you'll stay.  'Cause when we're torn apart, Shattered and scarred. Love has the grace to save us. We're just two tarnished hearts. But in each other's arms. We become saints and angels.  These feet of clay, They will not stray.  'Cause when we're torn apart, Shattered and scarred. Love has the grace to save us. We're just two tarnished hearts. But in each other's arms. We become saints and angels. (Saints and angels, saints and angels, saints and angels, cont.)

      Artist : Black Eyed Peas  Song : Where Is The Love Featuring Justin Timberlake    What's wrong with the world, mama People livin' like they ain't got no mamas I think the whole world addicted to the drama Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism But we still got terrorists here livin' In the USA, the big CIA The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah Badness is what you demonstrate And that's exactly how a n**** works and operates N**, you gotta have love just to set it straight Take control of your mind and meditate Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love The love, the love  It just ain't the same, always unchanged New days are strange, is the world insane If love and peace is so strong Why are there pieces of love that don't belong Nations droppin' bombs Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones With the ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug If you never know truth then you never know love Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know) Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know) Where's the love, y'all  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love The love, the love  I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder As I'm getting' older, y'all, people gets colder Most of us only care about money makin' Selfishness got us followin' our own direction Wrong information always shown by the media Negative images is the main criteria Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria Kids act like what they see in the cinema Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity Whatever happened to the fairness in equality Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under Gotta keep my faith alive to lovers bound  People killin', people dyin' Children hurt and you hear them cryin' Can you practice what you preach And would you turn the other cheek  Father, Father, Father help us Send us some guidance from above 'Cause people got me, got me questionin' Where is the love (Love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love)  Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love) Where is the love (The love)

       "Save A Horse, Ride A Cowboy"   by Big & Rich     dum dita dum dita dum dita dum dita da da dum dita dum dita dum dita dum dita da da da da da  Well I walk into the room, passing out hundred dollar bills, and kills and it thrills like the horns on my Silverodo grill. And I buy the bar a double round of Crown, and everybody's  gettin' down an this town ain't never gonna be the same.  (chorus) Cause I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city, I make a lotta noise cause the girls they are so pretty. Riding up an down Broadway on my ol' studly "Roy" an the girls say "Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy" Everybody say's "Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy"  Well I don't give a dang about nothing, I'm singing an bling blinging while the girls drinking long necks down, and I wouldnt trade ol' Leroy or my Chevrolet for your Escalade or freak  parade, I'm the only John Wayne left in this town  (chorus) An I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city, I make a lotta noise cause the girls they are so pretty. Riding up an down Broadway on my ol' studly "Roy" an the girls say "Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy" Everybody say's "Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy"  Well I'm a thoughbred, that's what she said in the back of my  truckbed, As I was getting...buzzed on sud's out on some back country roads, we were flying high, fine as wine, having ourselves  a big & rich time, an I was going just about as far as she'd let  me go. But her evaluation of my Cowboy reputation, had me begging  for salvation all night long, So I took her out giggin' frogs,  introduced her to my ol' bird dog, an sang her every Willie  Nelson song I could think of, an we made love.. (Chorus) An I saddle up my horse and I ride into the city, I make a lotta noise cause the girls they are so pretty. Riding up an down Broadway on my ol' studly "Roy" an the girls say "Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy" Everybody say's "Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy"...what..what.."Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy" Everybody say's "Save a horse, Ride a Cowboy"

      how certain people who claim to hate drama are the ones who create it? I mean, I never have any problems on  urlLink LJ  until  urlLink Adrianne  stuck her nose in. Hell, she threw a fit like a 2 yr old when  I  deleted  MY  icon community because it was completely dead.

       "One Kiss From You"  by Britney Spears    I'm dreaming of one kiss from you A love long and true We'll go on and on and   I don't wanna hear that I'm too young To know it's love that makes me feel this way 'Cause I don't have to feel the heat of the sun To know it's shining on me every day When it's warm outside And the look in your eyes Is longing to show me the way I don't want to wait  [CHORUS:] Just one kiss from you, and suddenly I see the road laid out in front of me You give me strength, you give me hope And when you hold me in your arms You make me whole And I don't know just what I would do Without one kiss from you  I don't wanna hear my time will come When it feels like it's already here We should learn to walk before we run But why go anywhere when you're so near 'Cause when I reach out to you So sad and confused And feeling like I could cry You dry my eyes  [Repeat CHORUS]  I'm dreaming of one kiss from you A love long and true We'll go on and on and I'm looking for one kiss goodnight To last all my life On and on and…  [Repeat CHORUS]  I'm looking for one kiss goodnight To last all my life

       "Burn"   by Usher    I don't understand why See it's burning me to hold onto this I know this is something I gotta do But that don't mean I want to What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just I feel like this is coming to an end And its better for me to Let it go now than hold on and hurt you I gotta let it burn  [Verse 1] It's gonna burn for me to say this But it's comin from my heart It's been a long time coming But we done been fell apart Really wanna work this out But I don't think you're gonna change I do but you don't Think it's best we go our separate ways Tell me why I should stay in this relationship When I'm hurting baby, I ain't happy baby Plus there's so many other things I gotta deal with I think that you should let it burn  [Chorus] When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to But you know gotta let it go cuz the party ain't jumpin' like it used to Even though this might bruise you Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you Hate the thought of her being with someone else But you know that it's over We knew it been through Let it burn Let it burn Gotta let it burn  Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to Got somebody here but I want you Cause the feelin ain't the same find myself Callin' her your name Ladies tell me do you understand? Now all my fellas do you feel my pain? It's the way I feel I know I made a mistake Now it's too late I know she ain't comin back What I gotta do now To get my shorty back Ooo ooo ooo ooooh Man I don't know what I'm gonna do Without my booo You've been gone for too long It's been fifty-leven days, um-teen hours Imma be burnin' till you return (let it burn)  [Chorus]  I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down  and cry (ooooh) I'm twisted cuz one side of me is tellin' me  that I need to move on On the other side I wanna break down and cry (yeah)  Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?) Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh  So many days, so many hours I'm still burnin' till you return  [Chorus]

       "You Are"  by Jimmy Wayne    Baby when I look at you You know it breaks my heart in two How beautiful you are I've seen you in a million dreams Now you're finally here with me We will never be apart I wanna hold you forever That's all I'll ever need  CHORUS:  You are my love You are my life My heart and soul The truest friend I've ever known You are my world All of my dreams My fantasy, my reality I love everything you are  Every time I close my eyes It hits me so deep inside How real this feeling is I'm intoxicated by your touch It's a sweet, sweet rush I'm in love with your kiss You're the one I trust the most You changed me  CHORUS (x2)  Everything, I love everything you are
