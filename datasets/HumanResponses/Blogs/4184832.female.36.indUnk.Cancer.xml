      Rumour has it that Will and Holly are cousins... could it be true?

      **This post contains spoilers**  Will's alliance was spared a major blow on Thursday night when, by a vote of 7-1, Holly was evicted from the house.&nbsp; An endurance Head of Household competition ensued.&nbsp; Will made it to the final three, but after getting promises of safety from Jase and Diane, he voluntarily stepped down.&nbsp; Diane went on to win the competition many hours later, which means Will really is safe this week (along with Adria/Natalie, Nakomis, and Karen).

      It's genius! Nominate 2 decoys from the GPA, then only GPA get to play in the PoV. One of them wins, takes off one decoy, and up goes Jase - who is then easily voted out. Smart thinking!

      Yes yes, it's a sad day for Will fans everywhere as he has been nominated, even though as just a pawn... And to add on to what the wonderful Spamgirl (Hey Spams! :D) has previously said, everyone send good thoughts Will's way that he will be able to either pull himself off the block with veto or avoid eviction...

      There seems to be another twist heading towards the Big Brother house- is it going to involve Will?  Only time will tell, but for now, it sure is fun to speculate :)

      Do you like Will?  You're definitely not alone!  According to CBS.com's "Love 'em or Leave 'em" poll, Will is now the most liked Houseguest in the house, far ahead of all the other houseguests, with a rating of 9.0.  You rock, Will!!!

      The other night I was watching the live feeds and Will and Nakomis were talking about their dream guys.  A clip of it was even shown on Thursday night's show.  What is Will's dream guy?  He is skinny, with tattoos and chin length greasy, brown hair.  Nakomis agrees that they like the same type of guys.

      Well well well... there sure are many strong opinions on Will's grand exit this evening!  Many people feel his parting words were childish and assinine, etc etc...  I personally commend Will for the way he went out.  He didn't cover his feelings with a false 'lovey-dovey' type goodbye- He was feeling raw towards both Adria and Natalie and had no wish to tell either of them goodbye...  I've read that Natalie didn't deserve the cold shoulder she got from Will; however, remember back to when Adria and Natalie were discussing who to nominate for eviction...  it was Natalie who first brought up Will's name...  I said it once, I'll say it again- I commend Will for an honest exit from the Big Brother house. :)

      In a stunning (that is, if you don't have the live feeds) turn of events, Will has been evicted by Adria's tie breaking vote.  Having previously assured Will time and again that he was safe, this vote did little to help Adria's falling stock in the house...  Shortly after telling Will of her vote, Will refused to look at Adria and would not hug Natalie.  His last words in the Big Brother house were to Adria:  If karma is a boomerang, I'll be seeing you sooner rather than later.   During his interview with Julie Chen, Will refused to even look at Adria's (Natalie's?) goodbye video, before bursting into tears at Karen's.  He wished Karen and Nakomis the best of luck before heading out to the Jury House.  Adria's vote that evicted Will did very little to help her plunging stock in the house.  In a 'sweet-revenge-esque' turn of events, Nakomis went on the win the Head of Household for this week...  Who  ever  will she nominate??

      It seems the winds of change may be coming back to the Big Brother house... Diane has apparently realized that it is in her  alliance 's best interests to evict Will this week, however, it is in  her 's (and consequently, Drew's) best interests to evict Marvin this week, citing that the twins will only get strong if Will is gone... Diane didn't feel it right to blindside Will with an eviction on Thursday night has (graciously) given Will a warning about the plan to evict him, which is not making Adria, Natalie, and Cowboy too happy... Diane has said she plans to try and talk to Drew and sway him to vote for Marvin, also... it's true things can change on a dime in this house, but for now, at least there is some hope that Will is going to stay...  Keep those fingers crossed!  (And your toes, too, just for good measure ;-D )

      As it seems more and more likely that Will is going to be evicted on Thursday night, I've been thinking about Big Brother, the game, etc etc...  And here's a warning- I'm probably gonna get pretty sappy in this post...  Very rarely do the 'good ones' make it to the end and win, (Case in point: Alison and Jun- the house as a whole did not care for either of them) so really, it very well may be Will's time to go.  He's made the jury, anyway, so he will be sticking around for the rest of the game in the jury house.  (And with  Project: DNA , who knows what will happen?)  Really, I'll be sad if he's evicted, but Nakomis and Karen will still be in the house to 'avenge' his eviction- Will won't have to be in the house when things start to get really ugly...  All in all, I'll be okay if Will is the one to go this week (I know other fans of BB5 and Will that have said they will be wrecked if he's gone this week and may stop watching the show, even!)- regardless, I'm glad he was on the show.  Watching him, and his commentary, on BB5 has been a blast and I'm glad to be a fan of his.  That said, Best of Luck to Will on Thursday- who knows?  Maybe it will finally be Marvin's time?  This  is  his third time in the eviction chair...   stranger things have happened...

      Highlight to read...   Adria did not use the veto.  And sadly, Will still seems to be the target of the 'Twisted Twins' Alliance...  Things are not looking good folks, things are not looking good...  but then again, who would have thought Adria would have stayed over Holly, especially when the Horsemen were in power?  Stranger things have happened- keep those fingers crossed!  -  - End of Spoiler

      Here's a luxury competition spoiler-  Will (along with Drew and Diane) won a screening of  Without a Paddle  last night.   -End of spoiler.  Sadly, what Spamgirl has reported is indeed true- it's starting to look like Will's days are numbered... :(  Granted, they (The Twin Alliance) are still discussing possibly putting up Karen or Nakomis in place of Marvin to really break up the alliance, but for now, things aren't looking too bright for Will- as things stand now, he could pull off a 3/3 tie (with Karen, Nakomis, and Diane voting for him to stay), but that would leave the tie breaker with Adria...  (The twins know Diane is playing Nak/Karen/Will and have accepted that she will vote with them)  It's interesting to note that Will seems to think Drew will never vote him out- let's hope that holds true!  Stranger things  have  happend (Remember Adria vs. Holly?  Whodathunkit? :D)

      Rumour in the house is that the Twin Alliance, Adria/Natalie/Drew/Diane, is gunning to get Will voted out of the house! Let's hope Will can pull something to save himself!  (Hi Roomie :) )
