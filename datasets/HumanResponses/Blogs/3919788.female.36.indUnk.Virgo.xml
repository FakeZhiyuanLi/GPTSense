						   This is a hard one to deal with........        I was around 15 when I started smoking.....        I grew up in a small town in Indiana.........Plymouth       Lets just say the song:         -You can't take the honky tonk out of the girl-        by:Brooks & Dunns.........   Nails it on the head about me~       (As you'll find out I love music and   probably have a song for each issue)        Ok back to the issue at hand.........SMOKING........  Do I let her do it or not?        On one hand I did it, stoled them from my mom &amp; family,   lied about it.....        Got caught and got the old fashion ass whoopin..........   Still did it thou .....   Now I can't and wanna quit....        Then there is the other hand..........Her hand..........        "She is going to do it no matter what I say"   she" is" almost "16" and "everyone is doing it"        Do I do what my parents did to me and take her out   back and show her the backside of the belt?        Or do I try and be the reasonable mom and lay down rules.......        I want to be the "cool" mom the one she hangs out with  but how far do I go with it?   I was always the kind if you tell me "Not to do it" I did it!   I'm really leaning towards the rules..........  (Thanks Tracey for these)   Rules:   1. NO SMOKING IN THE HOUSE/That means all HOUSES!!!   2. No       smoking around me period... If she is going to do it then I don't want to see her do it~   3. If I have to buy them then that means she has to work for them.......Not small chores I'm talking mowing the grass, mop the floors, clean the birdcage out....It isn't going to be a simple task.........She will work for it!     Let me hear your views on this!   Coni

						   I have been doing paperwork for my father-in-law due to cancer and tackling the Social Security issue is really ticking me off............All these years he has been paying for it and now is being declined because he is receiving short-term disability thru work and makes too much money.......  He is completely disabled and paying so much on doctor bills that money is super tight for them.  We all have to pay Social Security but when you need it back you have to fight to get it!  What are your views on this issue?  Coni
