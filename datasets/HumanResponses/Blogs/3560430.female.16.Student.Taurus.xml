      Ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha ha ha. And I wold continue but for the fact that I don't want to.  Iworked out again yesterday it was really nice to be out on the floor again. I love martial arts it's just a matter of remembering that. People think I'm wierd becasue I like to kick and punch things for recreation (or at least my friends do) but I say, "hey I can't kick and punch people, so I'd best do it to bags." I think that that is rather sound logic. Last night I had to half teach the class. that was kind of unsettling fo rmy first night back in about two or three months. I don't like teaching right of the bat, especially since my dad runs the place and I always feel like he's I don't know kind of disappointed. I try but sometimes it just doesn't feel right. Personally I thought I dod ok, but I never know what he thinks of me when I'm on the floor with him watching. If it had to do with writing I know, stuff like that I know. But martial arts I never know.   Well I'll post later today for know I have to clean up after the Gnome.

      Well now that that is done with. That took way too long to figure out it's even hard to remember what I wrote. OH! Bethie is abandoning me! This is sad and crazy I'm mourning the loss of a Bethie for ten days in which time I need to collect money and make serious party plans. This isn't cool. Well I'll figure it out:)   I find that my writing on this blog is much more disconjointed then my actual writing is. Puntuation in funny places, really no focus, well what ever, there is interesting attitude!   Got my marks today! They are better than normal, 98% accross the board in English 10/11 Honours. It's a beautiful life when that happens. Speaking of school (and I don't know why I am) Comparative Civilizations will be so cool! Expecially with Bethie in my class! Our parties are great but I think that our conjoined projects will be better! Trust me that's saying something.   Until July 14 I officialy have nothing to do. This means some serious vegitation time! I'm talking movies writing and a whole lot of reading! I'm thinking of catching up on some of the classics once I'm done with my re-read of Outlander. I'll do a classic and then read Dragonfly in Amber, or I'll read Draginfly in Amber and then a classic... Ooh this could be dangerous. I'll end up reading complete fluff all summer and maybe get in one classic near the end. I shoudl try and read one on my way to Calgary, that might be an idea.  Now to move on without any transitions what so ever... Oh never mind, let's go back to report cards. I also got my annual as well, lots of people signed it was great! So many of my friends have gotten hair cuts and that kind of bothers me as I completely believe that people should stay the same unless I say they may change. It's kind of a gradual thing with me. Some people  say I'm obsessive compulsive, others say that I'm just quirky. I say I'm wierd. That's just me. I also have a problem when people walk on the wrong side of me or when certain objects aren't perfectly simetrical. There's also the problem I have with colours. If specific colours don't coinside with other colours then I kind of go a little bit nuts. Of course they have to work in accordance with the structure and clolours they are with. Alright so I'm a bit odd. All I'm saying is that another one of my "things" is when people change before my mind is prepared. These were ok though, everyone's hair is beautiful.   Well due to the fact that I'm a trekki. Bethany shut up! I'm being called away by the computer to watch Voyager. This is the episode where harry thinks he's an alien. It's kind of sad but I really really really like it. I think it's genetic.

      I really don't like working, it's annoying, but I think I'm going to have to get a job. Rogers videos is taking applications now, so I've printed up the old resum√© and am ready to get to it. Rogers video can't be as hard as catering was, not to mention it is a whole lot closer at hand. I have two around me that are rather close. I wonder when my shifts would be??? They can't be too close together. I hope that I get the one that's close to the mall, that would be really nice because if I had to go to work right after school I could easily bus it over. Or even walk if it wasn't too hot, too cold or raining (I have very specific requirements for outdoor exercise.) It would be nice to have a pay check though... SHIT I need a sin number! I forgot about that... And a bank account would be nice. Ok I have some things to do before I get hired. I will get hired, I'm a great interview. Plus I'm honest. It'll be nice to get a pay check though... Very nice.   Well I'd best think this over.   My mom's watching another one of her pathetic, none-real shows that were possibly popular in the early nineties. I need to talk to my bethie, I've got to annoy her before she gets too heavily into studying for History. Poor stupid Bethie taking that poor excuse of a course called history, BAD CHOICE! Nobody cares about the very slim amount of time that the board considers history. I mean it is history, but trust me there is a lot more of it, and that is way more interesting.   Well I'm off a running now. Maybe I'll post later. I'm only really posting now because I'm prolonging the event of me cleaning my room... Scary thought.

      Ok onto another thing from my W.E.   There was this woman on staff (or volunteer... I think volunteer) I'm going to start off by saying that she was a lesbian. Now I have no problem with people being gay. In fact that is one of the top things on my list of 'Things I really could care less about' you see I figure if you're into guys cool, your into girls great, I don't care what bloody gender you are. My only problem is when you have to bloody well wear a sign saying "Hey I'm homosexual!" I hate the double standards that gay people get to play with! Or the excuses they pull. I'm not speaking for all of them, I know a couple of gay ppl that could really care less if the whole world knows. They're good ppl. But this woman would not stop talking about being a lesbian. The perks the reasons why she's persecuted against, the everything. Everything she talked about had to do with her sexual orientation. Let me tell you that that gets really annoying really fast! I heard her discussing with another woman about this man who told her she was too loud or something to that effect, she said in response, and I quote, "I really don't care though 'cause he was a total homophobe.' If he was or wasn't has nothing to do with him calling her loud because let me tell you she was (and probably still is)very, very loud. I really hope I'm not coming off as a homophobe myself. I just hate it when people dwell on their sexual (or other people's sexual) orientation. I think that it is a pointless conversation, due to the fact that it is that sort of shit that brings about arguments with other people. I'm not saying to keep opinions in the closet, that's censorship, I'm just saying that for others to except you into modern society you need to be able to get along with people without calling out homophobe at every person with a divers opinion.  Sigh now that I'm done with that.   I swear I have ESP! This student volunteer who worked with me was telling me about her boy friend. The moment she started talking about her I couldn't get the thought "He's going to break up with you this week" out of my head! It just kept spinning there and every time I talked to her or she talked about her boyfriend that was all I could think! Three days later she comes in late (she had been sick the other day so I just thought that she was staying home sick), and I say "Hey Jan I thought you were staying home sick today, how are you feeling?" and she says "I feel like shit, my boyfriend broke up with me yesterday." I felt really bad about it but I couldn't help but give an inner smile because... Well wow creepy.   Lalala today has been really nice so far! I'm going to read and do all sorts of great stuff once I'm done with this. My dad and I played backgammon for like over two hours. It was really neat because there wasn't really a prevailing winner, it went both ways. And that's all I've really done today. Although I think I have daddy really liking the Bare Naked Ladies. Humm I'm going to go have dinner now   Ciao!

      Well well well. I am for the first time in a week well rested with nothing to do. This is fraking awesome! I plan to vegitate in front of musicals all day. Oh it will be beautiful. The other day fo rthe first time ever in my history as a student worker at Crab Tree Corner I was allowed to work in the day care. The only part of that that  I really enjoyed was the fact that I got to hold this really cute little baby who for no reason I ended up singing at. My mom used to sing to me when I was rally little so maybe that was it. I think it was probably an unconsios thing. Of corse it could also be the fact that I tend to sing regardless of where I am. I must say thought that holding that cute little baby quickly lost it's charm once I had half my head of hair (Hyperbole) pulled out.   My work expiriance teacher came to visit me yesturday as well. It was cool becasue he's one of the few teachers I actually enjoy talking to! He was my grade eight drama teacher and was crazy good at his job. Unfortunately after a few tramatic grade eight classes he quit doing drama and moved to work expiriance. He says that the reason he switched to W.E. wasn't the kids it was that he needed a change. I really don't believe that. We got into some fun convos about my expiriance and he was really shocked at how much I wasn't shocked about what I saw. Maybe it's my craxy vivid imagination, but I find it very hard to be shocked. Maybe it's becasue my expectations are too high (in that I expect most of the people who come in to be absolutely screwed). I think if anything shocked me it was the behavior of teh staff. I find that when 'normal' people do wierd things it blows my mind much more than when people I expect to be fucked up do wierd things.   I'm just glad the 'Expiriance' is over. It leaves me time to wake up late, edit ect. I plan on finishing the editing today. That'll be nice. I hope I can get it to Beth quickly. I don't really think she'll be able to finish her part in time But I know she'll try. This is really my fault. I thought that I would be able to do stuff once I came home from work but really that's a no. I tried and got like a page done.   Away from that though, I think Bethie and I should do a web page together! It would be really fun!  And it could be like a summer project for her that allows her head to be able to do something on days that she feels she has nothing to do (I know how much that annoys her). So I'll throw that idea around.   I plan on going through my W.E. systimatically so that I can throgh all my thoughts around. We'll start haveing fun with roman numerals for the 'Blank' heading.

      Yep my mind is shooting blanks. Poor Bethie. She's sooo grumpy. Of course I still am reluctant to believe that 8:00 is, and I quote "the crack of dawn" but what ever. I will defend my honour later, right now I have a bath a book and a Bethie in need of attention.

      Mom's bitching about salad. It's really quite sad.   I'm totally ready for bed! Bethis going to bitch about my making her get up early to pick up a book that I'll have ready for her. If she's smart she'll get Chelsea to pick it up for her in the morning as chelsea should be awake to get to school. I'm hopeing she'll wake up for it becasue I like causing pain in others when I'm in pain... the pain of haveing to wake up at about 7 to go to work.   I'm going to go eat now, then go to bed.

      This is going to be short and brief. Redundant but I don't care. Todya I was considered technologically advanced. Scarry huh? No I am pretty good at the program my 'employer' had me working on. I like WORD it's always good to me. I'm going to watch the wizard of Oz now and probably edit after that. it won't be done though. Still I'll try to get a book to my Bethie tomorrow. It'll probably be the pillars of creation. I'm almost done my book as well.   Ok the wizard of Oz DVD opening sequence is getting to me I have to go now.

      Bethie may really really want to edit, and I may only have like two pages worth of hard copy shit to do, but that is deffinately going to expand out! That and bethie had no life as she so clearly stated, I do thus making it hard to edit. It's kind of funny though I'm not going to have a life the week she can't edit.   Work expeiriance was lovely. I was pretty damn boring for most of the time. The most exiting it go tfor me today was when I had t breakk into my house. Still haven't heard from Wall-Mart. I'm deffinately going to work on that. Must phone them if Chad can manage to not be on the phone.

      It's deffinately time for bed. I have to work tomorrow. It could be funny watching me try to get up tomorrow. I have to be out of the house at about 8:15... AM! I would like to take this oppertunity to thank Bethie for the beautiful book indicatore. now all I have to do is get her to show me how to use it. I think maybe dad wants me to transit home tomorrow. That should be funny. I'm not a good transit persone... Stop laughing Bethany. It's not very nice. Aug I forgot I have to bathe! Well too late now. I'll do that in the morning. Must go read. Richard is screwing himself over again by not thinking properly or listening to other people's thought a little too closly or not closly enough. I wish he would just look for the simply complex solution this time! But no he will have to go it the hard way first. Sigh... Story of my life.

      This really sucks. I've lost my purse at Wall-Mart. no one believed me at first but I told them that's where I lost it. It was really busy in the changing rooms and I was rushed out, the moment I was out the fitting room lady came in and did her sweep I guess becasue I remembered that I had leftv my purse in there about twenty secoundss later went to the door knocked asking the lady if there was a pusrde in there. she said no, then I asked the lady who took every thing out, she said no, I asked her if there was anything in with the clothes, no. Although I didn't see her check so now I'm really ticked off because it was one of my favourite purses. my purses are like my children I love them. The fact that they are gone kind of makes me want to cry. That and I had ten bucks in that purse!

      I managed to stay up for six hours today, only two of them I was completely awake for. I figure I'll probably watch a few monies now that I'm awake, awake. I think I need ice cream... And tuna. I realized that last week I watched approximately three hours of t.v. That's totaling the amounts I watched while glancing.   I got Bethie to set up my I-mood, I'm very proud of it. Now I have to get her to set up that nifty book thing. Very cool. I'm contemplating getting dressed, kind of. Probably in different P.J's but that is the beauty of summer vacation.   I watched The Killer Tomatoes Eat France or something to that effect. That is a frigging hilarious movie! Almost up there with Rocky Horror Picture show... Maybe with a few more musical sequences.   If you haven't gotten it I plan on doing Jack this weekend. Next weekend I have to work on east Hastings and Main. I'm doing it for work experience. Did you know it has more knifeings and AIDS/hepatitis cases per capita than any other place in North America (I'm pretty sure that that includes Mexico). No my work experience is not being a hooker, it's working at a woman's shelter. My dad plans on walking me to and from the door. He's very nervous about it all. I kind of am too. But I figure I should be Ok.   P.S. I love that Simpsons.

      Ya I am so mot impressed. Inu Yash isn't new tonight, I've waited and waited and it still isn't new. I want  new  inu yasha shows. Today was the last day of school. Yay! Last day, I'm so happy, I only have to go back to pick stuff up. It's great. I have time to read and write and have fun. I also have time to get money for that trip thingy. I really wish Laurell K Hamilton would blog. I miss her. Beth will be happy to know that I only have two and a quarter pages left of editing to do, and I'll try and get it to her asap. I have to email people about Raven's party because if I don't they'll forget to bring me stuff on june 29th. My summer looks like this: June 21-25 working at a woman's shelter, July 14th raven's B-Day party, July 18th Cultus lake with my Kung Fu people, July like 20th I leave for Calgary (I;m not sure for how long), August 9-20 Science world helping children learn. This doesn't leave me much room to make money. But I'll try dear god I'll try.

      How to make money for myself... Such a difficult question. I have let's see thirty dollars already put away for this writers conferance in Surrey, so I need... 400-30... let's see... 370 more dollars. That's a lot. I make most of my money on bottles and cans. Don't knock it I got $67 and something cents today! Any how I'll probably be able to get about 200 by October. My parents (dad) say that they may be able to throw money my way if they get a couple of students to live in our basement, but I can't count on that. So I have decided that I'm going to get people at my parents bussiness to give me their bottles, if I can. I've got to start working out again so maybe my smiling face will encorage people.   Another method of cash grabbing I may try is posting a baby sitting sign at the school (Kung Fu School), that may bring in some revenue... I want to get more but Agg... it's so hard not to spend. I believe that I may be able to manage though. The only things I have to spend money on is father's day and Ravens b-day, that's about thirty five dollars, anything else goes towards Surrey. That sounds really bad. What ever. Ya. I think I know what I'll get daddy though and it may not cost all of what I think it will. Ok that and the fact I'm going to calgary so all my change goes to that, that's a considerable amount. I'll see if I can squeegy the $15 for Raven's birthday from my parents... I don't know what else but I'm pretty sure if I talk to a couple of people I will be able to do it.

      I forgot. Today there was this thing in the hall where my Corey and her friends were talking about my guy friend. Apparently he's like really pissed at them. I think he's pissed at me too but I don't know. Guys in general aren't that big on the whole communication thing... Except for my dad he generally is. But really most males (at least in my school) aren't into talking about it. I told them to leave it be, he'll get over it and if not apologize and tell him that there is not much more you can do. I just hope I didn't do the wrong thing maybe I did maybe not. Who knows. I'm just glad I could type it out, it helps me organize my thoughts better.   Apparently this girl I know who's math mark is like 55% just got 90% on the final, I hope I can do nearly as well. I'm going to study my ass off for it. There are no two ways about it I'm determined to get at least a B.   I'm doing work expeiriance next week at a woman's shelter, poor Mr Arthure was nearly panicked when I told him I might take transit.I really hope that my dad can drive me the first couple of times. I can't afford transit.

      I'm going to try to get this posting jones off of my back. I've determined that if I do it now I will be able to focus better when I'm at home. That and I will not have the urge to sleep thus makeing it harder to study. My Robyn said that my math final will be pretty easy. I'm hopeing she's right. I mostly have to study for chapters 5-8 out of nin. I'm just going to breeze past 1-4 and do a quick review of nine. 6 should be ok because I pretty much get it. Maybe I should do some mandarin work now. Work on stabalizing a B for myself in that class.   I have found more reasons why my ortho is evil. These stupid wires on my bottom set of teeth are sticking up after I tried to floss, it sucks, and is totally pokeing me.   Yay about my science final though. Exept for the electron, proton, neutron, issue I think I may get a B/A. I'm a good student I'm just a bad test taker. I get really nervous. Hopefully though it'll be ok I mean there were only like five questions on that and then of course I'll get like ten wrong on princable, and then an additional ten as wild cards, that I knew but either changed or printed in inncorrectly. So that leaves me with a deffinate 75% ... I may get more, but I can garuntee at least 75%. Well it's better than a fail.   It's funny. My parents don't beat me up about my homework nearly aas much as I beat myself up. Good news though, I'll be getting more than 93.2% in foods class. That brings me from a C+ in term one, to a B in term two, to an A in term three. That should give me at least a high B avarage. My English average should be crazy good. I'm very worried about my textiles mark though I think I have about three zeros. Luckily in Textiles I have a 90% on one of the majore projects and a high B on another. As well my samples are pretty good. As is my journal. I think I should get at least a C+ for this term or, at least I hope so.   Raven's party prep is going well, I would say more but she may stumble onto this little blog and that would be a tragity if she learned too much too soon.   Well I'm going to do my mandarin homework now, I may post in about 40 minutes... I may not. Who knows... I will deffinatly post later though.

      This describes my mind at the moment. A mixture of all of my scientific knowledge. I'm ready for bed now. YAY! Bed... You have no idea, or maybe you do... I don't know. Bethie is teasing me, that's not very nice. I had dinner and that makes my head feel better. So I'm going to leave now. YAY BED! This is fanfreakingtastic! I'm so excited about sleep. Is that sad.

I mean if you just stumble onto my humble little blog I would like to know. I went to this Ren Fair and really liked it, but I"m not sure what kind of gameing I'd like. Went on the gameing central forum board, but nothing was really explained.   AAAHHHHHHHHH computer taking over brain.   Cannot have a replay of todays math test in science tomorrow. MUST GO!   Really...  I have to...  Stop it...  Grumble...  Fine I'm gone...  Do I realy have to study? ...  Ya I do...   Sigh.

      What the hell... Aww my Bethie loves me! She hacked onto my blog and gave me a counter. Freaked me out but YAY. Thank you Bethie. I think this is a bid of hers to make me feel better. It worked, but I am now considering changind my pass words. JUST KIDDING I love being suprised like that. And she even remembered not to make it an ugly green colour!   ... Must study... or have a bath.

      I cannot focus. I have a science provincial tomorrow and I cannot focus. My reasoning is that if I get all the stew that is swarming in my head and just write it all down right now I should be able to focus and freaking well study my ass off.   Today was intriguing. I took That guy I was talking about before, aside and we had a conversation, but I"m not sure if it made him feel better or worse. My problem is I'm not nearly as good at talking to guys as I am at talking to girls. Maybe just knowing I care about him will help but I really don't know. He did allow me to replace a lot of my fear for him with anger at this ass hole Asian racist who dwells in my mandarin class, and with the help of his homies (you see he thinks he's black) teased me relentlessly. But that stopped. Because you see they weren't the major problem it was this other white kid and this little butt head named (I can't say because it is considered slander). They're horrid. They talk about my east Indian friends and call the sand N*****s of all things. I think that's pretty bad. I mean people go on about how the white man has like this whole racist, cultural biased thing going on but they seem to forget that there is racism in all cultures, the Chinese and the Huns were going at it way before the blacks and the whites were. I mean look at the English and the welsh, or the native tribes vs  other native tribes . Every group has their racist ass holes, and just because the whities seem to be getting more publicity about it doesn't mean we are the only ones.   Now that that is off my chest. You see this guy friend of mine was trying to defend a friend of his who is about a year or two younger and in turn got into a fight. But if he tells the office that he was attacked he'll most likely get expelled because he keeps doing stupid things. Not like really bad, but bad enough. My school has this thing where if you are in a fight that somebody else started (i.e. they attacked you) you may not defend yourself because then you are an aggressor. In other words they want you to sit and get pumled until somebody... An authoritative somebody... A teacher... Or something... Comes to help. Now this makes no sense. A persons not just going to stop hurting you if they attacked you because you played dead. That's actually a very good way to DIE. It really pisses me off too because this way the bully gets away with what he/she was doing. They get in trouble but so do you. IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.   Bethie wrote about how imperative she and I make our rounds with all our friends. But I don't see how we can. It's such a tedious process. Sometimes I feel like I'm just meddling and not helping at all. And other times it's not like that. Other times I really do feel like my friends understand that I care. She also said I may cry when I get home. In fact she almost guaranteed it. Well don't count your chickens and all that. I was too tired to cry. I was too tired to sleep for heavens sake.   And now my carpal tunnel syndrome is setting in. Gnome just said that tylonal might help. I'll try that.   The only good things that happened today were that I got extra time to study mandarin and thus probably got an 80% on our last test. And I brought my poetpholio, and it was gorgeous. It took forever to finish though. I had a printer emergency, the first one I went to had no paper, the other didn't have word software, then I went back to the other which had paper, but I had to use the backs of used paper... Only to watch as, once my printing was done, a macki lacki came with real paper. I could have cried then. Of course I counted myself lucky after words when I went to English to find that my Court hadn't gotten any sleep... AT ALL! She's been up for about 48 hours now. So my motto today has been "well at least I got more sleep than Court." Sadly enough this kept me going.

      It's been a long day, very long. I just got 30/50 on a math exam that helps determine my term 1 final. It's funny how I'm the one in my house who cares the most about that sort of thing. And then it took me way over a minutes past the bell to finish my term two test. And now I know that I did poorly on that, so I'm going to rejoice if I pass that. There goes my oppertunity to raise my mark. And now I want to cry because I spent hours studying for the term one test, and I didn't get to sleep till about 1:45 last night, and I'm so tired I can't even read, and I want to sleep but I have a science final tomorrow and AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH Yes that feels better. Must go now I can manage a two hour nap if I go to bed now.

      Finally I've done some homework now I can spend time posting to my hearts content! Beware this may be long and tedious.   Now let's look at the last relevant post I got... Oh god that was the 9th and this is the 12th. Disgraceful.   Well let's think about what's happened since then...   June 10   Oh that was a horrid day! My mandarin teacher forced me to go to bethie's house again. Now we wonder how my mandarin teacher could have possibly forced me into going to Bethie's house. Well it's simple and confusing all at once, let's begin (best pay attention).   I missed a dictiation test the other day due to the fact that the day before that class I had been performing in a play run by my school called the Chrysalids. Good Play, and Book. Well I had asked we had home work due next day or a test, I was told no. So I went to class completely unprepared thus I would do a makeup test next day. First thing that day I went to class and said "Ms Z. I missed a test may I make it up right after school today?" She said "Yes" so class ended and I went up to her desk but two other people were there with head sets. I said "May  I do the test now?" she said "No these people asked me first so I will deal with them first" UN TRUE! I asked her in turn if I could use her phone to call my father and tell him that I would be late (The test takes about 5 minutes not even). And she said no! No because she generally didn't let students use the phone, also untrue I've used her phone before, with permission. Huuug. My dad doesn't like when I'm late because that means he can't get as much work as he would like done, done.   Understandable. Well I'm sitting there like shaking because I don't want my dad to be pissed off. Beth being the friend she is sticks with me the whole time, I told her to just go home. Well I finally get to the test and all that after waiting for about twenty minutes, and Beth is waiting outside for me! I asked her why she was there and she said that when she went down dad had been waiting in the parking lot and starting to move stuff over so that the two of us could jump in when he looked up and there was only her. Very confused he asked were I was and she said that I was still up in the mandarin room where my teacher hadn't allowed me to use the phone. It doesn't cost anything for the teacher to let me use the phone, it's the school's bloody phone! Well he got pretty ticked off and Beth offered to take me to her house where I could call him once I was done. he said ya and I ended up at bethie's house, playing hours o tetris and spending way too much time trying to determine what to eat. I didn't get home till about ten. And dad is still threatening to call and complain to my mandarin teacher because he didn't know where his daughter was.     June 11th   This was an intriguing day. Nothing really big happened for the first while. I talked to Mr Arthur about a work safety seminar that everybody going doing work experience this summer was supposed to go to during block C or D. Turns out I just didn't get the letter what do you know? Well I went to the block C seminar where we watched a movie with really bad music that tried to creep me out. It didn't need creepy music there was people enough getting limbs amputated and paralyzed. There was this one guy who now needs to use a bowel stimulater to go to the washroom. It was pathetic and freaky. Well I left that freak fest and went to the library. From there I started going to Socials class when one of my friends cornered me "Susan is there any way after school that I could talk to you, it's about [friend's name]." Well I didn't really think about it then, I just knew it was really important to her to talk to me. By that time I was ready to buckle down and do my other homework in socials where we would be watching Lord of the Rings. Not as interested in watching Lord of the Rings as I would normally be due to the fact that I was having a Lord of the Rings party that night I asked to go to the library where I could focus on other homework. Mr B is one of my favorite teachers so of course he totally agreed offering the option to go to the library to other students as well. So about seven of us went to the library and worked quietly, where Actress was working at the computer, I would have asked her about how things were going but she's beginning to frustrate me and she looked busy so I didn't bother. Well it got to the point where the lack of posting was getting to me so I started a blog, and finished it inbetween laughing my ass off at Shorty and Actresses wise cracks about their futures and how shorty wants to get on second city and from there on SNL. But by the time I was ready to officially post my school bell rang and I had to leave. GRRR I think I mentioned this last post. Well I really had to get to friend so I abandoned the post and hoped for the best. Once I found friend we talked. It seems other friend has been trying to kill himself lately. Lovely hu? And he's been getting closer and closer to succeeding. Friend's friends phoned her and said that other friend phoned her to talk about it. I know that this drama seems too much and that Other Friend probably won't but I'm worried and think I'll probably take him aside on Monday. It seems people come to me about this sort of stuff a lot, so I have lots of experience in this sort of thing. Needless to say I was rather occupied throughout the movies, as was Beth due to the fact that she knows Other Friend as well. It was hard to deal with but I've been surviving on chocolate and other such things since (there goes Atkins until Monday).    Today       Today's been pretty standard did some editing, and some English. I'd best continue editing and englishing. I may post later to give myself some thinking relief.

      I wrote a rather long post yesterday but due to urgent bussiness I had to abandone computer before I could properly post. Gosh be darned. Well I can't expect to be able to post every day. I'm just going in now to say hi to all of my fans. If they exist. If not then I too (Beth does) have a mild case of schizophrenia. At the moment I should be editing, but I'm not due to the fact that I have lot's of homework. If I don't get all of it done by at least the middle of this week Bethie is going to slotter me. That would deffinatly suck.

      Went to the doctor's today. I'm not sick or anything. This week I'm perfectly healthy. My mother made me go because I apparently have atrocious breath. Now I believe that at time it can be bad but I'm doing all I can to fix that. Heck I even gargle with hydrogen peroxide! So really my breath is just lovely.   The stupid springs are making my face hurt. From my nose to my chin is in pain.   Boy whoever reads this must think I'm a horrid looking smelly person! I'm really not, I just tend to dwell on the least desirable of my features. I've been told I have lovely hair, good eyes and great lips.   Finished that Anne Rice novel of mine. Ended pretty much the way I thought it would, but I still enjoyed it. Now I can start on the other one. YAY!  I've determined that I have an exam every day next week. That's really not very nice.   Oh Oh, I just remembered! I was utterly shocked by the stupidity of one of the graduating grade twelves in our school today. She asked me for a word that rhymed with foot, so I said soot, and she asked me what soot meant! What does soot mean? Now really you've got to be kidding me! She's in grade twelve she must have taken a provincial, she's got to be at least passing... HOW CAN SHE NOT KNOW WHAT SOOT MEANS! Of coarse I explained it to her and then... MY GOD... she wrote it down and spelt it sout... Where did she learn how to spell? I mean obviously she can spell foot, and soot rhymes with foot, so I don't know why she couldn't spell the bloody word. Well I told her it had double L's so she spelt it again, SOOUT! SOOUT! I nearly cried. So I just took the pencil and did it for her. Now I'm not picking on some mentally handicapped kid or anything. I know this girl pretty well, and she's pretty darned intelligent. She can sew like nobody's business and is very articulate. But I just can't get my head around her not knowing the meaning of, or how to spell, soot.   WHAT IS OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM COMING TO?

      Ya... I'm reading Anne Rice at the moment. THe Vampire Lestat, it's pretty good. I enjoy it. I'd enjoy it more if I didn't have a book comeing up after it that I KNOW is going to be way better. It's just that I like the writer way more. It's a Terry Goodkind, part of the Sword of Truth series. I'm sure I'll have really bizarre dreams, but heck it'll be a good read.   Speaking of dreams. I should start recording them here. I have loads of fun dreams. My latest dream involved me being pregnant. Even though I'm a virgin... Maybe an overshare but more often then not I dwell on this fact... Let's not go there...   Anyways in this dream I took a lot of transit, ran through the woods from my hose to the mall, (there are no woods between my house and the mall.) and then caught a train... literally I had to like run a jump on. Now I was only pregnant for like a brief moment, I'm talking like dream seconds but it was wierd. ANyways I don't know where I went on the train but it involved a corner store near to my parents old bussiness revinue. and a bunch of other wierd shit... My Bethie people are harmonizing!   I can't remember the rest of the dream but it is bizzarre any how. OH there was a really big tube comeing out of a whole in my houses wall that an old biddy I know in real life is watching over like a hawk as she bitches at her dog and the dog tries to attack me and my grandmother.   I may be wierd but I'm very creative so bite me. I really want to do some editing on the story my Bethie and I are writing but I'm not at home at the moment so that may be difficult. Ahhh miny beth is being mean about her grandfather's cooking. That's not very nice!   I'm horrid the two of them are doing dishes at the moment and I'm typing up a post. Oh that's amusing but not very good when it comes to being a gracious guest. WOW it's like 9:15 and my parents haven't even called yet! I should work on that. I haven't seen an adult since like 3 o'clock.   I did spend my after supper time channel surfing and watching really racy, bad, music videos... Music videos accomplishes the bad all on its own doesn't it? There were other things on too, but we didn't spend nearly as much time watching them. My Bethie got her T.V. guides mixed up. Silly Bethie.   I really should go now, actually talk to people   TOODLES!

      I am the kitchen pirate! I take over kitchens and although I try to be nice every time I allow somebody else into the kitchen (doesn't matter which one) I cringe because they are not doing it the same way I am. The problem is I am at my bethies house and it is her kitchen under seige! You see we are both controll hogs...i DON'T THINK SHE FORGIVES MY KITCHEN CONTROLL HABITS AS SHE TOO IS NATURALLY OVERBEARING... Oop caps lock key... Didn't mean to press that...  I'm being glared at right now. It's not that I don't trust her cooking skills it's that I know mine... I don't know hers... as well... She's picky... I'm not... Well the kitchen pirate must return... It no wonder the people in my foods class generally hate or love me... I swear I'm nice when I'm not cooking.   WEll I will post later I must over see cooking etc... I will trust her when we move in.  Maybe if I keep chanting that it will come true.

      Orthodontists are the biggest sadists! I have these really wierd things in my mouth at the moment (for three to four months!) and I'm absolutely paranoid that I'm going to break them. I've been told that I'm not even allowed to open my mounth too wide! My brace brackets keep getting caught on the springs and I have to unlock my mouth every time I want to talk! I've been cursed with an over bite! Why god oh why must I be punished so? This is horrid, it's like haveing a sore throat for three to four months so you try to minimize how often you talk.   This should be good for my waist line though, it's taken me ten minutes to get through two small peices of cheese!   As for my none-mouth related life. I have an exam every day next week. And one this week. My school is running the provincial pilote programme for provincially testing grade tens in math science and english, I guess this is in replacement of the FSAs.   Ahhhhhh... Trying to chew again and it's not working too well. The only good thing about these springs is that you can't see them... Unless I show them.

      My Bethie is the modern day Marx,   With one exception her theory may work.   She is the communist theorist in her house.   She is determined that her "Theory of the Weekend" will work. I say she'll be dead on her feet by the end and actually looking forward to *shudder* school. You see My Lord of the rings party is on Friday. We'll probably be up till like 3am or 4am. From there she will most likely be picked up at about noon, where she will clean her house and have a brief nap. From there she will eat dinner, once she is done with dinner she will have another group of friends come over to her house (they're grown up girl guides) to watch more movies and eat more popcorn. Then all the girls will leave (the next morning), and Bethie will go with her family to see a movie (Shrek 2). I swear the theory works on paper and it has been approved by parents. But will she survive?   Like I said Bethie is my Marx.   Well I must be off now I have to do my mandarin home work, I really don't want to but I really don't think that I have a choice in the manner... Grr... Must raise mark to a B... Must raise mandarin mark to a B... Must make honours with distinction!    P.S. Honours  is  spelt with a U... I'm Canadian OK? Good... Because  our  spelling makes sense.

      My gnome is bothering me  he says I have large feet.   Oh ya my gnome is this guy who lives at my house. He's trying to be a cop, he's annoying, in the way only tiny people can be. He says my feet are toys with the internet cables, I can't help it if I have the longest legs in the house, that stretch to the far nether regions of the computer desk!   I swear this is a 5'3 living breathing full grown man. Thus he is the Gnome.   I realize that I am posting very often. Once the novelty of this online journal blog deal wears off it won't be nearly as often.   That guy who does coaches corner for hockey seriously annoys me. Don what's his face, ya him. I don't care about what he has to say and he has an annoying voice! Grrr.    ‚ô™Sunshine lollie pops and rainbows everywhere!‚ô™ ... I've gone off to my happy place. Humm the me in my happy place is hungry (again) must eat...  My Unifriend isn't responding to my emails. I wonder where she is. Or if her computer is being rude to her again. I sent out a party invitation to her about a Lord of the Rings night that my three close friends and I could have and she had still to get back to me about it. It's already been like twenty-four hours! What has she, like developed a life or something!   Oh ya I'm hungry. Must leave... Must check Laurell K Hamilton's Blog... MUST EAT!   P.S. I've got to ask NeverMore if she will be attending the party as well.      P.P.S. Gnome just said I have monkey toes, I must go now to beat him up!

      Hey all of my supposed readers.   I've a new friend to add to my list of people. We'll call her Actress. Actress doesn't think she can act any more (which is devistating for her), her cousin is dieing of cancer and her friends aren't that great at the moment. Not myself but her best friends, we'll call them Ash and LoudM. Lucky for her she has a good friend taking care of her at the moment. I won't even give him a name it's not worth it, and I probably won't talk about him often. I'm just saying all this because she has real problems, I mean her folks kicked her out of her house becasue  they  couldn't deel with  her  depression. Really it's kind of sad when adults can't take care of their own offspring, really! I'm saying this because I go to high school and notice all the angst just flying around. People like Actress have real problems, people that go about moaning because they think they're way too fat when really they are a size ten or something like that don't have real problems. I mean this is just me saying all this and when it's my angst I'm sure I'll be moaning around too, but it's just annoying me the way people seem to ignore the real issues. My school had two deaths in one day. A grade nine and a grade twelve, they didn't even know eachother! They most likely had real troubles, bad hair probably wasn't one of them, guys that's just a bad day. But what really disgusted me was the fact that people were running out of class crying those days, even if they weren't sad, they did it to get out of class. How disturbing!   My councilor likes to talk to me, I tell him my issues aren't that big in comparisson. He seems to think they are, it's kind of nice to know that I'm not the only person out there looking out for the mental health of the student body. Most of my friends come to me or my Bethie (my best friend) for councilling and general comfort. It's amazing how many cutters there are out there! As well as kids who have attempted suicide. It kind of makes a girl think.   Well I'm going to try and be normal now! Ooh Kim Possible! YES!!!!! There goes normal...  P.S. My brain is saying no more typing, my carples seem to agree... They're conspiring...  P.P.S Damn body.

At the moment my mother is watching a sappy show about a kid who just wants to cook but whos father wants him to play base ball! GASP cooking isn't for boys (rolls eyes in a sarcastic manner!). Ever wonder how a cat knows exactly where you're looking when you're readin? My cats really good at it. I can be reading the sunday funnies  and there he'll be on the exact comic strip my eyes are on, it creepy. I swear he reads my mind!

      Well I could be writing or participating in a triathelon (not really). Instead I have been cleaning my room forn the past couple of days. It's sickening. Out of papers and broken knick knack'ish things I own I've now produced one full garbage bag. Another half bad is devoted to things I'm just getting rid of, ie. Garage sale applicants, those and the bag I made two weeks ago out of clothes I no longer wear. That means I have three bags   full   of junk that is never entering my room again after I take it out. The only new posts out there at the moment are my own. That  is severly annoying. I don't know why but they (or my computer) have taken away my colour options. I liked it better that way. I hope it's a my computer thing.   I'm almost done "Queen of the Damned". It's a good book but just like the other Anne Rice I read, "The Vampire Lestat" it is very slow going and in turn kind of annoying. When I say slow going I don't mean the story I mean the way I read it. I can't read that book in long bursts.   Bethie has JUST called me! I'm on the phone with her right now. YAY! I would continue but that's rude.

      We have shelving people! It's taken... Almost a month of careful preparation but I finally have my shelving hooked up! Yay. My room is becoming progressively less cluttered, it's a beautiful thing. I want it so that my room is organized and fully functional by the end of the summer. This is because my room gets pretty bad when I'm in school and every extended vacation or day before a party that will take place in my room ends up a suzie clean fest. Not always a good thing. So I want my cupboards clean and everything in its place. I know my mother is planning a garage sale pretty soon so I'll scout out the stuff I'm ready to be rid of. That's probably quite a few things.  FYI: bethie if you would like to set up another station of stuff to get rid of I'm sure I could handle that. If not... Well I think I'm accompanying you to the hair dressers during the "five hour hair fixing" so you can join me in front yard bliss.  I've determined that I really have no clue as to when and what time Bethie is coming home. I'm assuming Sunday. If it is Sunday that's tragic. I won't be home from about 4:30 pm on. I will be at a back yard BBQ at one of the club people's houses. It'll be lots of fun and there will be lots of good food but I won't get to call bethie if she isn't home by then.  I woke up at two today and still haven't done much. I plan on editing tonight but shhh don't tell my fingers.  First things first though I plan on continuing cleaning my room.  Wow the spell check isn't working. This is bad.

       My Bethie has gone to camp. You know that. And while I'm glad she's haveing fun... GRRR. Unfair. At least I'm getting some quality editing today.       I haven't done much today. But what I did do was very produtive (it just depends on how you look at them). Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa. I'm not sure if my mother is calling me or not, if she i s  I don't care. I'm ignoring her.       Beth is haveing fun, that's good at least. I'll just keep saying that. ha. Well Fraser is up to about nine pages or something. Somewhere around there. I still have to do about four or five pages. gaa. that'll be an isue, I'm looking forward to it and not. I like writing but i'm in a bit of pain.       AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAh. Mom bought another useless item today a toothbrush holder for the down stairs washroom. Not only do mom and I, and a couple of other people own electric tooth brushes, but the regulare ones that we own wouldn't fit in the wholes. They are made for people whos hands get uncomfortable when they brush their teeth. You know my hands always get horrid rashes when I brush   my   teeth. I just   have   to be entirly comfortable when brushing my teeth or I'll spontaniously combust. You know it's true.

       Well i'm sitting around half naked trying to edit. I'm only half succeeding. Look at my last post. I've only done about a half page since then. I've eaten popcorn though. That helped a bit. It's too stinking hot out.       Well I'd best break into the serious writing issues music. Ahhhh. Blogging always makes me feel better becasue I always know what to say. heck it's like a journal. If you have nothing to say make it up. I have yet tohave todo that. Still writing writing is so much harder, you have to creat these little worlds and then stay consistant with them, it's hard. Well I love it anyways.       My parents are probably going to be home soon so I'd best be going. Why should that matter. Becasue I'm half naked duh!

Whay does the key board in my room hate me? Why aren't I listening to the musc that I put on that is playing in my room? Why aren't I finished reading Queen of the damned? WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY???       'Cause.      Well I'm kind of sore and hungry so I'd best go back to writing. It just doesn't feel right though. I think that these are pages that other pages will be built off of. It's just they are so blah. Maybe I'll have to rewrite them later. I don't know. They just don't feel right! Ah! I don't like this not feeling right I want it to be good the first time around! Well maybe they just don't sound right to me... Maybe they will sound better to other people. Maybe. I don't know, this is really very very frustrating!!!!!!!!!!      GARABLEDE GOOBLEY!       FLING FLANG RANDOME SWEAR WORDS!!!      Hu. It'll be better if I get through this and just finish this bit and then move on. I think that if I just get past this then it will all be good. Sigh. It's just really really hard.

       I've been craving chinese food since we made it into Calgary and I got my wish tonight! Yay!       I always forget about how great working out is until about an hour or so after a really intense workout on a hot hot day when my limbs go to jelly and my mind to mush and I think "Wow that was a little bit fun." I forget that I'm good at something until I do it. The only thing I ever give myself aclaim for is my writing and even then I'm doubtful. Well I'm watching city slickers right now (gotta love Billy Crystal!) and that means mom want sme there. As well daddy had to kill some of the big bad viruses.       Wow my limbs are going to be mush tomorrow. Thank heavens I had a looooong bath tonight. Yay!

       I really don't plan on doing much today.     I did some writing last night that I'm really not ready to share yet. It's still very raw.     I thought that I would have to slaughter my computer for impertanence but it seems that I will not. Everything is ok, life is good. I had written this huge post (as you can see) but my computer had a hissy fit due to the fact that it has not had ample care since we left (the Gnome doesn't know how to take care of the computer really well). needless to say Ithought that it ate my post, it didn't. And so I posted it this morning... Duh. I guess you got that.       I love noght time. For writers like myself it is so bloody inspirational! Last night while listening to my Evenescense CD I just got all these ideas in my head and couldn't not listen to them. So I ended up just writing away! But enough of that. As I said I''m not ready to share yet, it's still too raw. I will admit though it got frustrating because my mother just barged in the room in search of betteries and it totally disassembled my muse :(       Today I'm going to work out. I've missed two weeks after doing two weeks. It shouldn't be too bad though because I've kept active. I did a lot of walking and such while on vacation, so this shouldn't be too much of a shock to the system. I just hope that I have something to wear! I know that sounds corny but it's true I only really have about two pairs of shorts that'll do and I used one of them on vaction and I think that the other may be MIA in the washer/dryer. It's very odd becasue my clothes go missing all the time, even if I put them in the right place to be washed/dryed. It's very frustrating as you can imagine.       Well I told myself that I would watch a Disney before it was Voyager time so watch a disney I must. Ta ta!

       I'm very tired after my trip. I woke up at 1:45. It was beautiful. Of course we didn't get home till about 3:30 am but it was a great trip so it was all worth it.       I miss my Bethie... A lot. I plan on doing some editing for her. But first I'll catch up on what I did while I was on vaction.       1st day. July 20.       We took off at about noon, one o'clockish. And it was a lovely drive all the way up too Invermeer where the resort Panorama was. I spent most of the drive reading and listening to music. I learned all sorts of interesting facts about the Barenaked Ladies.Panorama was so lovely and relaxing, of course I didn't realise that right away because we didn't get there till about 1am and crashed right away (well not right away I read some more)       2nd day. July 21.      Woke up and determined that there was nothing but junk food in the condo we were staying in so I brought some chips and cheesies up to my room to eat (what I'm on vacation) as I read page upong page of Voyager. My dad then woke up and went to town (literally) for food, you know real food. Then my mother woke up and when my dad got home he ran up the stairs as excited as a child at christmas becasue he managed to shoot some great footage of a baby moose the was munching on grass at the side of the room. Mom and I watched the footage and then dad made us a great breakfast. After that we rotated use of the shower and then went to go check out the hot springs that this place was so proud of. Once we stepped out of the door we were delayed by the colony of cliff sparrows that were building there little city right outside of our condo. Dad had to run back in grab his camera and take pictures. We saw all sorts of sparrow babies and nests, very cute and pretty. After that we went to the over priced general store to grab some sun block, mom forgot ours at home. It turns out that that is one of the things that isn't over priced! That made us very happy. We took a gondola to get up there (this place is on a mountain) it was really great, I've never been on one before. The pools were great it was a hot water spring that also conected to water slides and jacuzzies, as well as a regulare pool. So nice and relaxing. One thing that really suprised me was the fact that none of the lockers had locks, it turns out that this place is relativly crime free... WOW! Once we finished at the springs we headed home. My parents wanted to go to town again (I thought that that was wierd why didn't dad just go and get dinner while he was at the store the first time?) I decided to stay at the condo and read some more. So in respect to that I did read but I also ended up sleeping a bit. I hadn't gotten much sleep the night before. My parents got home and we ate dinner and then I read some more, on the couch this time. Then my mom decided to watch a movie so I pulled out the couch (it was a bed/couch thing). We watched a taped version of Back to the Future III. I've seen the movie so the fact that the end got left out was ok. We got multi flavoured Sherbet to go with our movie. Then I went to bed to, suprise, suprise, read some more.       3rd day. June 22.      Basically the same morning except dad didn't have to go out. Then mom decided we should go play mini golf as she was pretty sure that that was free and she had never done so before. Well we got to the mini golf place and it was $7 a persone to play. Mom was unimpressed with this so she said skrew it we'll go for a walk. We wnded up walking for a really long time along a beautiful river. It was freexing GREAT! I loved it. We turned around after walking up a huge hill for about 1km. My mom didn't want to continue, she was getting too tired, that and she was wearing flip flops. When we got back to the activitie centre we asked where the hill led to, it turns out that we might have ended up going up hill for 5km! Good excersise but my god OW! Apparently we were going the wrong way, if we had started from where the springs were we could have gone down hill the whole way. After that we went swimming in the springs again, really great. The rest of the night went nice and slow, we had dinner cleaned up, got into our pj's then watched Kill Bill. Wow I did not think that that would be as great a movie as it was. Of course I wonder if half the people who liked it understood it. It was fabulous. I'm really looking forward to the second one.       Fourth day. July 23.      About the same morning exceot we had to pack up and leave for Calgary. It was sad becasue Panorama is so great, we're going there next year as well, mom plans on saving up so that we can do some white water rafting and horse back riding and make use of all the other ammenities (I'm hoping for one of those spa day things.) My parents cleaned the place so that it sparkled, all part and partial to the getting invited back by my great aunt and uncle. Once we took off I started reading Queen of the damned but the road was really bumpy so I started getting kind of naucious. So I slept it off. Once we got to Bamff I woke up and we spent a great time shopping. I wish Bethany had been there with me, that place was Moose Mecca! You have no idea how many moose one place can hold. WOW! I even have a picture with me cuddling a giant stuffed moose. When we did finally get to Calgary we debated whether or not to stay in the Best Western. So we got there and they said that they didn't have any more places, which was rediculous because my great Aunt Merideth booked a whole block of rooms for the family, it was really really bad to because we had the rudest man behind the desk treating us like the scum of the earth. Then we went to a bunch of other places and they to were all out of rooms to. We finally found a place (one of the other hotel people booked it for us). When we got there it was 10pm, and we still hadn't eaten dinner, mom was ready to kill. We ended up eating at a dairy queen (gag me my god it was horrid).                          Fifth day. July 24.        Day of the wedding. Good wedding. The ceremony was standard except whent eh bride started to pick her wedgy and wipe the sweat off her hands and onto her dress. We all laughed, that's just the way my family is, and that's really what Brenna (the bride) is like. After that we ran to the hotel room, changed (mom and I were dieing in the clothes we were wearing) after that we went to my great aunt's house to hang out and visit the family we don't normally get to visit. That was really nice. Not really exciting but very nice. Then we went to the reception. That was so good, great food, great fun. First we just nigled then we ate and then we danced! The food was minimul but yummy, and there was more later, with the cake. My aunt Robyn, who was sucking up big time, ended up buying me lots of boose. That was nice but my parents were a little ticked off, not at me they don't mind my drinking, but at my aunt, just on principle. They had to find something to be ticked off at her about. I didn't get drunk though, thought that that would be a bad idea at what is practically a family reunion. I only had three of these vodka, citrus things. I don't know their names, it was called a skrew something or other. I drank jjust enough to get me a little tipsy. What a new sensation! Of course as always I danced my butt off. Such good music how couldn't I? The next day my parents told me that a man walked up to dad and asked who I was, he also remarked on how well I danced. Daddy got all parenty and said "my daughter she's sixteen." The man made a face and looked embaraced, dad won't say any more but mom was quite amused. We went home and slept right away.       Sixth Day. July 25.       Had breakfast at every bodies favourite french resterant Denay's. It was actually pretty good. Then went to the present opening at my aunt merideth's house. Said good bye to my Alberta family and all those I never see then took off for the ride home. It took forever. But was fun, we had a great dinner and I made them sing for a good couple of hours. After that we crashed at home.      I woke up and had a great time sitting. Then played on the computer for a very very long time. Checking my blogs and writing this. I plan on doing nothing for awhile longer.     ....God I miss Bethany.

       For Now.      I plan to have a blast in Panorama and Calgary but I'm going to miss my bethie imensly. If you want to see why check her blog, "I miss her already and she's not even gone" it's not a direct link becasue I am inept. All pact and ready, the cleaning frenzy wasn't too bad becasue my mom just really wanted me to focus on my room. Neadless to say my room finally did get cleaned, but not as organized as I would like.       yesturday I broke out in hives, so I'm going to have trouble in the car. Maybe I can make a game of trying to figure out which itchy spot is a hive and which is a legitamate bug bite. I determined that I had hives last night when my back spontaniously started braking out in itchy spots.       .........................I miss bethie. %&amp;$*&amp;.... I didn't think I'd dwell. But I am................      ..............Will not mention the fact that we came in last at the writer's convention contest.... Mostly 'cause I don't mind as much as I thought I would, that and my lovely assistant has said much of what I believe is true. We will succeed with this book regardless of how long it takes, it will happen.  If you want to read more on that Bethany Kind of had the last word.       This is so depressing bethany and I will be missing each other for like... two weeks. I should leave instructions for the writing of the chapters I'm leaving her with...      Especially for beth:        Finish what you've started with Laleena     Leave Fraser the bloody well alone!     Should you have troubles not editing after you finish Laleena Chapt. 15-16 move onto Taryne, make her longer and logical. [warning if I don't like it I will redo it, or you will, and then you will never hear the end of it!]          Leave the Fraser Laleena part to me in Chapters 17-18, I would actually like to do them     Should the need arise you may do Taryne Chapter 17,  not 18      Make Taryne more intense, have her knock a few people around, make some violent rememberances     Dwell on how quickly these pregnancies are comeing along     If worse comes to worse run through or novels for grammer and spelling as well as word use.         That's all I have for writing.        Should you miss me too much, Chad will open the door and let you in (Say that you want to borrow a book or something)      Should you need to borrow a book call ahead of time. You know where they are kept         If you don't want to seem wierd but you need a book, dear lord don't go to the library, that will just throw you right off course! Read Dracula. It will help you understand some of the laurell referances more easily. As well it may help you with your own writing.          If that doesn't appeal, read one of the classics that was thrown in your face by miss mathot.          Remember that I am most likely thinking of you so don't pout too bad.     HAVE FUN AT DEBATE CAMP YOU GEEK!     So that's it eth you list of instructions posted where you can see them. I hope you actually look at this sight before I come home. And you get back.      P.S. Tell your mother she probably won't see me when you are away because that is wierd :) and I'm sorry that I can't make it to the picnic ;)

       I was right I did have a very good day yesturday. Had lots of fun with the friends and family and even though I put on lots of sun screen I still got really burnt up.         Beth stayed over afterwards. It was nice because I won't see her again until August (how disgusting!) We spent most of the night talking about just stuff, mostly friend stuff. Sometimes talking about friend stuff gets depressing. You wouldn't think it but it does. *SIGH*. I think I got a mosquito bite under my left breast, that is the wierdest place to get one ever! And it is really itchy.         Tomorrow I'm off and laughing on a fast camel. Ah George. I'm going to Calgary, as I've mentioned before, and plan on getting lots of reading and relaxing done, but not before the initial "Oh my god the house is a mess and I don't want to come home to a mess!" freak out that I know mom will have. The funny thing is she probably will come home to a mess because the Gnome and his 'friend' are staying here while we are out. They are not very clean. My mother is going to cry when she gets home.         Well I feel the book calling me so I must be off. Ciao.

       Soon to be off and on our way to Cultus lake. Must not make it known that I am on the computer or death by mother will be had.       Thank you Bethie for colouring it up      This should be fun, and even though I smin in a two piece tank top and shorts set I'm still nervous about my Kung Fu people (as Bethie calls them) seeing me in my bathing suit. I plan on working out through the school year this year, so that should help with next summer but grrrrrrr, any how.     Well enough of that I must be off to the lake and off the computer before death arrives. Ta!

       Well that was a bust I just wrote a rather long post and then my computer ate it. Well to sum up, I disscussed,          My guilt at not haveing edited last night      The Sumptuary laws of the Elizabethan era      The brilliance of the Addam's family      My tragic book dillema, whether to read Voyager or Queen of the  Damned next, and the fact that regardless I will be takeing the other  to Calgary with me.            The fact that my wrist is cramping up and I need to go to edit.             No that that is summed up I shall go becaue of item number five. And a little bit of item numer two.

       Every time I see the new formatting of this site I'm slightly shocked. This will definitely take some getting used to.            I woke up at 10:15 this morning and then 1:30 (exactly). I had woken up at 10 to call the ortho's office because last night I popped that stupid bracket. Unfortunately they were out for the weekend. Getting the bracket fixed before I leave for Calgary should be very interesting. I leave on Tuesday the only time I can get it fixed is Monday. If my friends stay over from Cultus lake that day then that leaves me a very small window of time in which to get my mouth fixed. My mom is going to be very displeased about this set back in my mouth work, she was very adamant that I get it fixed today. I may be in for an ear full.      I'm debating whether or not I should take off to go to the Kung Fu school today or not. It would be a good idea to get a little work out in but I'm not sure. I would like to have a day of nothing. Well not really, more like a day to do what I love at my leisure. This means editing (I've overhauled four chapters so that means poor Bethie won't be able to do the Fraser parts). It also means that I will be able to read and watch a movie or     sigh     just sit. Maybe I'll have another bath as well.     If I do work out that would be good, but I really don't have the motivation. But does that matter? Ug I'd rather not debate this with myself right now.       I found I've been so busy that my writing has been neglected. And for some odd reason my school anxiety has yet to be shaken. I wish it would hurry up and take off. It may not even be that I'm frightened of this coming year so much as the year after that and university.   Grrrr  . I'm beginning to feel the pressure to get scholarships and bursaries, and... Well I should finish this bit now I know very well what my anxieties are.           Well Voyager is on and I haven't seen this one so Ta!

       Wow new formating on the blog website, I like it.       Didn't post last day, I didn't have nearly enough time! It was a really great party. SO MUCH FUN! We had great games, added in one becasue we completed a couple of the games too quickly. I won Hot Potato, the only one I would be interested in winning as the prize for that game was a piggy bank, I have a slight love of piggy banks, I'm on fourteen now, although my purse obsession wins with seventeen.    The night before I worked on a pinata that ended up looking really good but really creepy to. I may post a picture later on when my dad loads it onto the computer. The birthday girl desimated it in three swings, blind folded.After the party Raven Beth and I had a sleep over, it was really nice because we haven't all been together to just talk for a long time. We fell asleep talking at about 3am and were lying across the bed width wise (is that how you say it?) We watched a really racey movie before hand called origional sin. Really good plot with lots of twists and character development as well as very hot sex. Definatly not a children's show!      I made food this morning and Raven was thrilled as she took her brand new CD player home with the AA betteries that I gave her and the Beetovan CD that I allowed her to borrow. Sunday should be great because we'll all be together again to hang out and go to the beach.       Today was rather odd as one of my brackets fell off while I ate a chip. Just POP, and it was off.       I have to say that aside from peculiare orthadontia goings on I only have one complaint about the last few days. And it's not even really a complaint. I saw a rather odd skin oddity on one of my friends that rather shocked, yet honoured me. For the first time in... Months (wow) I've seen her shoulders, well any of her skin that's not her hands, feet, or face, occasionally she would let us see her fore arms. This weekend I saw her shins shoulders, and parts that aren't unseamly to view. She had a word engraved on her shin, and many lines running down her legs and arms. I wasn't really suprised and I wasn't shocked, just a bit... Well I don't know what to call it. But I felt it. I feel very sad for her skin. It was nice to hang out though. Great water balloon fight (got wetter filling them then throwing them) and wonderful conversations. Over all a great night.       I must now contemplait what to do. I think I need to clean my room over the next few days, I will I swear (how often do I say that?). I also need to finish editing the Fraser part of my novel, and maybe help with the Taryne, I'm not sure if Beth wants to do it or not. I'll probably just clean up the living room and vaccume like my mother wanted me to. Sigh. I must do something... Although I probably won't.

      Not the word. Just the term. As in I GIVE. I Give. Stop I just don't care anymore. That's it. I don't care about these people. If these people don't want to ensure that they get enough food, a good time or any of the important stuff. Well that's it, they can just go fuck themselves. I've done all I can now all I can do is hope that they show up for Raven. The really important people will be there. Myself, Beth, Cate, Laura, and well Raven. If we are lucky the others will show up too. if they don't then there will be hell to pay. She deserves to have her friends there. Already they've made it difficult but I refuse to allow them to make this day less than fun. I'm still trying to figure out if this will be a sleep overy type thing. Must bring that up as a plussish bonus deal thing. Maybe we'll watch Willow, I know raven loves that movie. If there are others around then we'll have fun with that as well.   I haven't done as much in the way of editing as I would have liked to. But I've gotten a good deal done. I'm going to finish up the parts that I've stated, and leave the rest to Beth. She should like that I know she's missed editing. I'll tell her to lay off until the 15th or so though so that she devotes her time to the party instead. Beth if you read this before I talk to you that's what I'm thinking.   At the moment I'm in a state of pissed off at my computer. It won't let me send, or save emails that I write. Which I think is odd. As well it won't allow me to read Laurell K Hamilton's blog or see her entire menu. It also doesn't want me to go onto my writers board. It normally is more then happy to let me go there. I want to read the stuff damn it.   I want my bethie. I'll give in now. She's coming home today, I'm allowed, becasue she's coming home. Late, might I add. I was under the impressiont that she was coming home on the tenth, no. I was like "well she's coming home on the 10th so I'll call her ont he 11th" Well forget that, if it's not too late she'd sure as hell better call me. Well even if it is late she can call me. Post! Dear god post, I'm ok with that f you post I will respond! Damn I miss her. Bloody hell I'm trying to refrain from being poetic.   What's worse is she'll be home long enough for the party and to go to the lake with me, then next week on the 20th I'm gone, and in the middle of me being gone she'll leave and then I have to wait for the beginning of august to see her again. Well I'm leaving now. I have to go maybe I'll eat a double brownie, that I made, that tastes so good you would cry.

      Ok time to make some excecutive decissions. Bethany will not be available until the 12th. My aunt fannies bloomers her mother will allow her out of the house then. In order to be done birthday stuff for the fourteenth we will have to pull a total all nighter. Or not... I have most of teh stiff figured out. Like what we're eating and stuff like that, but to keep all the people entertained I need help. Now I was under the illusion that she was back on the tenth (late at night) that I could give her a day to recoop, and then we would go for it. But now I have to throw her right on in there. That just seems unfair.   So in turn, I'm making shopping plans. We'll head to radio shack first for the present, and pick up extras in the mall, my research dictates that they have the cheapest prices for what we want. then we will probably go to Superstore (becasue they are cheapest) for the food food, I'll see if Bethie dearest can get over it. And then there are the decorations, we can pick them up willy nilly. I'm thinking mostly at dallare giant they have good ones at cheap prices. And then I have to contribute, as well I have to get Cory's money and the stuff bethie had and what ever else I can squeeze out of others.   AND PEOPLE STILL HAVN'T RE-EMAILED ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Well I have relatives from Edmonton here so I must be off for now.

      Well well well... I'm in a state of a bit of pissed off. People need to give me money and they're not. I need it if I'm going to make this party a success. people just aren't cooperating. I've had two responses so far. From an email I sent to well over six or eight people. Well there goes the clown. It's probably too late to book, and I couldn't have anyhow because the idiots didn't give me there frigging money. Well I guess I'll have to make somephone calls. I hate makeing bitchy bank phine calls.

      Went to the ortho today. Those people are a sadistic little bunch aren't they? If you don't have braces count yourself lucky. They 'Reactivated' my springs. I didn't know that they had been deactivated! But apparently since my teeth move so quickly the springs had moved the teth as far as they could, that is without the 'crimps'. Grumble. I don't like this. Grump grump grump.  I'm going to read my book for the rest of the day. Maybe I'll finish it. Unlikely but it could happen. All I really want right now though is popcorn. I'm holding out until my paretns go to work. Or maybe not. I don't know. I do need to edit... I keep saying that and most of the time I do but there  is the occasion where I'm either to busy to do so or too lazy. Maybe I'll play an internet game first. Wow way to print out randome thoughts. My mom tried some pressure points on me the other day to help my carple tunnel but, well it made it worse. Either she's not good at it or I am a freak of nature. I'm going to go with the second option. Unless we are talking about carple tunnel I don't feel very much pain in  my wrists, even when doing wrist locks in class and those bring even my father to his knees. So I'm going to stick with I'm a freak.

      Hello hello all. Or one. Had a bit of a fit yesterday, won't go into it, it's a bit embarrasing. My shins hurt like HELL! My god ow. I think it was from the skipping or the something else. All I know right now is that my Sifu is busy on his mission to have all his students in the best shape they have ever been in, this meens he'll end up in great shape to. The man doesn't stop. He has the strongest stonach, I swear it's like punching a brick wall. But then he's always been very physical.   Well I should go now as my cat seems to be reluctant to allow me to continue.

      I've never made that sound before but it seems very appropriate. Yawn, I want to sleep but I will refrain until I get home from working out. I'm bleary eyed that's not good. This is really wierd considering that I got ten hours of sleep, just the perfect amount for me. Well what ever.   Yay I managed to get my SIN number today. Good good good. Well I didn't actually get the number I got the slip of paper saying that they will give me one. This means I can check that little box off on my applications that says I'm legally allowed to work in Canada. Always a good thing. I'm very tense lately maybe I need a neck rub.   Hummm Went and saw Troy and Shrek 2 last night. Both were excellent but if you are going to see a movie in theaters go see Troy. People keep going on about the beauty of Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom, but I thought that Eric Banna was the most atractive. I think maybe because in chacter sence he was the best. Brad did a good job too. Orlando was good but his character was a total pussy. I did not like Paris. Of course Beth will say that he was the cutest because she likes her men to be the equivalent of veal. Translation: She likes tham to look very sheltered and kind of baby faced. I like my men to be real. I'm talking they need flaws, they need some muscle and they need a personality that doesn't radiate adoration. Maybe that's wierd but damn it that's what I like.   I know I was going to say something else but My fingures are beginning to go numb and that meens that my carple tunnel syndrome disagrees with my typing. Must go now and take pills to stop the pain.

      I'm FINALLY going to get my social insurance number, I've wanted this bloody thing since I turned fifteen. Now I can LEGALLY work in Canada. This is good because I need money. Of course I won't be able too start working until after August 20th because I would be so fired if I told my employers that I couldn't work for three weeks out of the summer because I'm vacationing, or partying, or going to the beach with my family or otherwise doing another job for no pay at Science World, all of which was previously planned. Ya I don't think that they'd like that at all.   You know I seem to be doing a total mend thing this comeing year. School year I mean. I'm cleaning my room, slowly yet surely, thus instilling more organization into my life. I'm trying to get a job, thus preparing to save for univercity. I plan on clubbing myself out, i.e. debate club, writer's club, arts council, possibly dance councill, I plan on starting liturature week in our school again, and probably another club becuase it looks really good on scholareship apps, that and I want to volenteer somewhere. Plus I'm going to be working out at least two times a week, somehow. Luckily I can re-organize work outs. The only thing I'm not planning for is a social life.   And if I do get a job then I have to be careful because I want to do that conferance in surrey at the end of October. What if I can't get the time off... Oh I'm stressing myself out and none of this has even happened yet.  I think I should keep a work out log... Naw that would just deter me. I plan on editing some more today, somehow. If I have time. I really hope I do, it'll be nice. I plan on finishing the Fraser part in beth's chapters, and the Taryne part is kind of sliding into place all on it's own. Of course I never know what to do with Taryne. She refuses to tell me ahead of time. But I can guess. What we have hard copy at the moment is amusing but kind of pathetic. Pathetic in that it sounds really young. No one except our parents would think it was worth anything. Poor Beth  might be a bit disappointed though she really enjoyed writing that part. Well I'll have to break it to her gentally. She's a big girl she'll get over it.   Well I have so much more to tell and so little time. Maybe I'll post later. It doesn't really take me long. Yes I believe I will. Ta ta for now

      Oh my god. If you are into greek dineing go to Kafi resturant. It is phynominal! It is so good. My parents and I (as you know) went to their grand opening tonight, some of the best I've ever had. I didn't think that I'd like squid, but what do you know I did.   Tomorrow is Movie day Yay that is going to be loads of fun.   Got lots of writing done today editing editing editing, lots of editing. I like most of what I've written but it's not as great as it could be, maybe I'm just too picky. Well I've still go tstuff to do, so I'll post later. Bye-E

      I must edit today. There isn't much to do. Seven pages out of thirteen for the parts Bethie wants me to do and then my own of course. But I don't think Bethie wants me to have that done as well. I finally finished that blasted Fraser part but had to cut part and add it into another part, it took some deliberation to figure out if that was a good plan but if I was to add it to the plan Bethany has it makes much more sense, not to mention allows the chapters to flow much better.   Raven's B-day party is getting increasingly closer and I'm having panicks. I've emailed/called Raven so that she can get me the emails for all of them, but she hasn't gotten to it yet, she will though I have faith. We're going to the movies together tomorrow. If we're lucky we'll see two of them, Troy and Shrek 2. This will put me back in the movie loop I hope. It won't cost too much either because if we do decide to go to two movies then we only have to pay one admission each due to the fact that I have special 2 for 1 passes. If we only see one movie we each get to pay 1/2 the admission cost. It really sucks that Spiderman 2 won't allow passes yet because I would replace that with one of the other movies. I'm not sure which though, I'd have to ask Raven, seeing that I would really like to see all three of them.   Today I'm going to the opening of a Greek restaurant run by one of the school members (martial arts school). It's going to be really good! I know this because I've already tried some of their food. Yay! It's really awesome too because we won't have to pay, it's a free trial. Free food is good.   Well if I'm to meet all my day goals I'd best be off. Must check the movie schedules and all that.

      And now we begin with a lead in rant about Canda hateing emigrints   I have a friend (well some one I've had to contimplate my friendship about for the past while due to the fact that she has been acting rather Cattie and well rude lately.)who has moved here from, well several different contries. She thinks she's better than everybody else becasue she is well travelled, and well versed in many different languages. There was a time when I really comended this person because she was really trying to pick up on Canadian culture and what it is all about. Very good considering she's living in Canada now. But for some reason (actually I think I know the reason) lately she has been playing the part of the superior European girl. It's really frigging annoying. "I just don't get North American humour" or trade the word humour for "expressions". She says this and I know it's not true because she said something of the kind like last month! AUG! Another thing is she continually goes on about how Canadian fashion is just not up to par, how we are insufficiant, so on and so forth, boardering on how we are stupid! she's never acted like this before and I really don't apriciate it. The school system the liturature, nothing is as good as it was in Europe. Well my dear I don't hear you complaining about all the freedom! I know for a fact (because you told me) that elections in your mother contry go a little something like this, your get the list of candidates, you're told which one you will vote for, you vote for that candidate even though they are already in power! But, no that's not why she's here even, she's here becasue at the age of eighteen her brother would have been enlisted in the army. Her paretns not wanting that moved here, to a contry that doesn't do that, that has fair elections, and that has pleanty of *GASP* freedom! What really gets my goat though is the fact that she is only acting liike this becasue a group of people think it's cool to have the tolkine forigner. Some of the people in the group are really nice, very cool people, others... Not so much. One in particulare actually. One that I wouldn't mind telling off one day. of course that is the opne that totally entrances everyone now, becasue she's loud and rude, and as long as that loud rude mouth isn't directing it's coments at you it's "Funny". Not so much. I guess she thinks that this is more European. But if European humour is mean comments made to hurt people I'll stick to my Canadian wit thank you.   Now onto movie talkers.   This may not be as long due to the fact that I'm not as rilled up as I was.   Movie talkers bother me. I hate to say it but it's true. Well no I don't hate to say it. If you are at home watching a movie with people you know and who don't mind that's one thing. In fact I encorage you to make rude guestures at the screen and yell at the charaters to your delight. But when you are in a theater where you have just paid $10.95 to watch a movie that you have been dieing to see, it really sucks when people talk above a whisper. And by whisper I mean face in the person beside you's ear. I went to go see a movie last night (HP3). And it was really good. It would have been better if the little girl on my left wasn't talking like she would at home "What's that""Why's he leaving""Is he a bad guy?". By little girl I don't mean like 3-6 little girl I'm talking at least 8-10. OLD ENOUGH TO SHUT UP! My other grievance was the loud woman beside the Gnome, who was on my right. She was in her late twenties early thirties at least "He's right behind you Harry!" "Watch out!" "That's not how it was in the book." It was a compation to see who I would throttle first.   My mother's a pretty bad movie talker. She has to ask dad what happened a lot either because she's not bright enough to pick it up the first time or because she had to go pee... Again. But that last bit's not her fault she has kidney problems... Still, SIGH.  My Dad can be a bit of an issue as well becasue he's partially deft. Not enough to be legally so, but if there is back round noise he's screwed. They're kind of perfect for each other in that respect. But my parents are qiet movie talkers, they WHISPER. Whispering isn't bad I can put up with it. It's easy to ignore. Heck I can be guilty of whispering, mostly when it's a movie based on a book I've read and liked. But I've yet to blatently just start talking like some beligerant fool who doesn't understand that people PAID to watch the movie that just magically popped up before them.   On the whole though HP3 was a great show.

      Alright now that I've got the latest one posted I can move on to this one (I know I'm sad two posts in a day but I can't help myself).   AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Laurell K Hamilton hasn't updated her blog! Sigh I swear I'm not sad.   Well I finally went to go see Harry P3. It was really really good. But I can't help but sit there and go AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. Yes they left out MAJORE parts. I was prepared for the absence of the second quiddich match, heck I sat there and preped myself for it. I said to myself "You WILL NOT pick apart what is probably a wonderful movie for the lack of one scene, it is probably a woinderful movie and should be seen and appriciated for it's artistic merit." And I didn't I really did like the movie, and aside from the absence of the quiddich scene I had no complaints... Well one. They left out the scene where    *SPOILER ALERT! IF YOU ONLY WATCH THE, I.E. YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOKS, YOU MAY  LEARN MORE THAN YOU WISH TO KNOW*     Harry learns that Peter, Sirius,  and  his father were  all  animugi. It was a really good p[art and I don't think Harry will learn about it until the fourth book. It'll really suck, I feel very bad about it. But chin up and all that. You know that wasn't the only part they left out, it was just the little thing that really got my goat.                                     *SPOILER ALERT OFF*   I love movies, they're great and I think in time I'll get over the loss of thes wonderful scenes. Well Let me end by saying that this post is probably very pointless, and that I really miss Bethany.   Next post tune in to hear why I hate movie talkers... Unless they are me...  Don't you just love double standards!

      Let me start by saying I did very poorly in grade 8 french and consiquentally have not been a student of the French language since.   Yay I got posts! I'm frigging thrilled! You have no idea.   Now onto bussiness. This Canada day I wasn't able to see fireworks (thank you for telling me about English Bay! Too bad my computer was dead) But I was able to see Trooper, as well as meet them, at Rocky Point. It was a blast my ears haven't rung that badly since... It's been awhile.   It's really wierd about parents, you think they're one way and then poof they're people. I mean ya I'm one of those queer (not that way) kids who likes hanging out with their parents. I can't help it if I got a good set! Still they suprise me sometimes. My dad's always been into the rock scene, when he was yonger he knew a bunch of the big names, expecially if those names were Vancouver based. He did the parties so on and so forth, and still never got completely ripped on drugs. He used to go hiking and skiing with one of the origional guitarists of Trooper (I can't remember his name). Dad introduced mom and I to his old buddies and it was pretty cool they stopped sighning for a quick second to talk and were kind of amused that he had gotten married with a kid.   This brag moment brought to you by...   Well GO CANADA! YOU ROCK BABY! So on and so forth it's almost dinner time. I'll probably post later tonight after we go to a movie.

      Huu I have so very much to do today. Not that I am disappointed about it. It's really all writing. I'll probably put some music on at a decent volume and then work work work. I think I'll probably get quite a few pages done to. Or not depending an what my parents plan on doing today. I really love my private writing time it's nice and, well lovely. Lovely is the only way of putting it. If I don't write I find that the ideas start clogging my mind and then I can't think as well as I would like to and well... For all of those who read Harry potter, think of it as a pensive, it's like the silver stream of my thoughts flow out through my fingers and onto the screen, it's really a phenomenal occurrence. It's hard to describe to those who don't write though, very hard indeed. I think it'll be nice to settle and write, but first I'm going to have to continue cleaning my room.   Today is Canada day (there I go with my lack of transissions again). Unfortunatley there will be no fireworks. I love canada day with fire works, it's beautiful! But becasue of forest fires we can't have any. I would still rather have forests then fire works though, becasue I even though I love both one of them only really occures once a year, and the other takes a couple of hundred years to grow. I wish others would realise that too, 1 out of 3 forest fires are started by people. How very irresponsible.   Well if I'm to write today I'd best go and clean my room now.

       Wow this week has been cracy I'm still trucking along though. I may get the urge to post on the weekend but for now I'm keeping it quick.       Children annoy me. I can't wait for next next week. Next week I'm working (still) the week after that I get "off". I'll probably be forced to do stuff but I won't have to wake up before seven. I won't even have t wake up before ten, it' is going to be great. I will have two weeks left of sleeping in. For now my  head hurts but I can survive one day until the weekend and one week until I never have to work for free again. I won't have t odo any work expiriance or step into science world ever again.       Well I'm off now time to SIT.

       I have to wake up at like 6 or 6:15am tomorrow morning. I woke up at like 1 30pm this morning. It is going to be sickening to leave the house at about quarter to seven in the morning. My plan is to get a little bit (very little) of excercise every day. I plan on walking to the skytrain station. Ooh Aah. My parents are thinking about getting me a transit pass. I really hope they do because then in the after noon I can bus home, you know when it is insainly hot out, that and I can bring myself to the school. Kung Fu school. At least my lunch will be good.    Beth and I just aren't sure what to expect. Will it be fun, boring, annoying? I hope it's the first of the lot. We've vowed to allow reading time when on the train in the morning, both of us will need to do that and niether of us are very sociable in the morning anyhow, talking in the morning isjust a very quick way to get into a fight.    I've asked my parents to make dinner relativly early tonight so that I can go to bed and read for as long as I normally would, (even though it will be like 9 and still light out). I also have to make arrangments to have to two o'clock voyager taped. god I love star trek (stop making faces at me beth). I'm sure mom will if Iask really nicly it's not like we are taping anything else. I don't think that I will bother with the three o'clock because that is a bit obsessive and I'm not as into that one as I am into the two o'clock.    I'm still hoping that beth and I can get to that tutoring thing. It sounds like a very good way to get some cash. hint hint.    Sigh I should be doing somthing, I'm not sure what but I'm pretty sure there  is somthing.    BTW: Beth you should start studying history and lit pretty soon, I understand that it is august but if you don't you're not going to do much better on the make up test, and that is your last chance, your mother can't annoy you about this one so I will, get to it girl you've only got a week!

       Ello ello chaps, ow's it going? Right oh then?    Alrighty my cat is attacking me for attention. This is mean. Cruel and wrong. Normally I wouln\dn't be so disturbed about it except he started just as I was beginning to post. His tail is running across the key board.     I'm soon to have the house entirly to myself! Yay! This is going to sound really pathetic but, I'm actually looking forward to arranging my desk. As for word of other roomly stuff I've finally put up the beautiful poster that I got for my birthdaym, and it looks really great on my door. Oh good cat has abandoned desk.     Beth and I had a great night. Five hours of cleaning, five bags of garbage, two bags of clothes she's never going ot wear again, half a bag of stuffed animals, two wal mart bags of recycling, and we are still not done cleaning and fixing up her room before the big fix up. Later on when every thing is painted and installed I plan on giving her a "seminar" on how to use space in a functional manner. I watch the show "clean Sweep" can you tell? It'll be nice to see her room all pretty. Although I have a feeling I'll be making my way down to her room in january or February (before her birthday and another onslaught of stuff, but just after christmas and the initial onslaught of stuff) to weed out more undesirables. I love my bethie but I pity her problem with pack rat assitis. Anthother bit I pity is the fact that she ends up with all the stuff her family doesn't have room for in her room. Her closet was full of other people's stuff. I fear what will happen when they go through their laundry room, or other wise known as the black hole! That room has a bag of mismatched socks in it from when beth was like five. It's really kind of scary. I don't know why they keep them. I have a theory that it may have somthing to do with a huge sock puppet festival they plan on throughing though. That must be it.     her sister's room got done up pretty well although I don't know how long she will like it for. The novilty hasn't worn off yet but it is VERY BLUE! I'm not using hyperbole here. That girl is going to be so sick of her room in a couple of years. Not that the rest of her furnature wouldn't be compatable with another colour of paint. I think that a green or purple, mauve, somthing like that would work very nicly and then the room wouldn't be crazy woman blue. That's what makes me feel really bad for Bethany though. Of course her sister is going to want her room. But I don't see the logic in that because Chelse made the choice of blue she should have to live with it. Just watch that will be turned around once Beth's mom decides that she will be the one stuck with all of the cblue furnature. I just don't see why Beth can't keep the stuff that is GIVEN to her. I just think it's her mother's way of detering any speak of leaving. on that note once the time comes when it is smartest for Beth to move I think her mom will come to her sences. I mean Beth plans on staying there for some time while she's still going to univercity. People change, so do oppinions.     On a lighter note. Bethie's mommy wants to take me with them to the Egypt exibit in Victoria! Apparently she wants me to go becasue I will be in comp civ with beth (and doing all of the projects with her) and Egypt is a huge unit in that class. I think the actual reason she wants to take me is because she gets bored without my random appearances, she has to book time with me. Speaking of that the reason I was at Beth's house... Her nother was bored. Apparently I have to be hanging out with beth for it to be ok for beth's mom to go to BINGO. I don't know what kind of reasoning that is but it doesn't really matter does it?     I got home and had some fun. I trye teaching genetics to my mother (basic) but she really doesn't get it. Kind of sad. She just can't figure out why I can't roll my tongue. So I tried explaining. Still didn't work. Well I guess it's just one of those things for her. Every body has "one of those things".      WOW I just figured out as to why it is my blog wouldn't let me do colour. I was on Edit... But why was I there? Hmmmm... I didn't click there... Well it's a mystery. At least I can do the colour thing now.

      I get to blog about our day FIRST! This never happens! HA HA!   Beth and I had a great day. Capital GREAT! First (for me) we walked to Ikea where we both determined that the shoes we chose were not nearly as good as we had anticipated. As well that particulare route we chose was riddled with baby diapers. Ew ew ew! Once we got to Ikea we headed straight to the resturant. We had a great breakfast and determined that the other Ikea meals looked pretty good (even though they had a rather large selection of fish beth agreed.) Then we completely scored the second floor. Beds shelves accesories chairs, it was beautiful! First we checked out the bed she wanted and the younger sister of it that our friend raven owns. Then we were confused by the replica of it in a show room that totally confused us because it seemed WAY wider (we determined that that was becuase it was the King sized version). But before we did even that we veged out in the computer chair section where we tried out various chairs. Then we wandered about a bit more, that was cool. Then we determined that we were wandering around three quarters of the floor and completely skipping the section of shelves that we were trying to get to. Finally finding the shelves we found this Uber Awesome square shelf of square shelves. It sounds really retarded but it would look really really good in bethany's new room. It would be perfect becasue she would be able to get rid of her dresser (wich was a total stitch in our sides) and her book shelf, as well she won't have to put shelves on her walls. We worked on the various reasons as to why this is the better alternative to the other options that would be applicable and expected. She's determined to get it and I'm with her on it (we didn't argue at all on anything!) We also determined that the gothic/tacky candelabra she needs to turn the room into what she wants is going ot be my christmas present to her. This means I can get other people to give her the REALLY tacky looking accesory table top holders and holders that hang on the wall to match the candelabra. It'll be so awsome. I also have to get somebody to get her the blood red camdle sticks. her mother is going ot have a christmas corinary.   Onve we were done with the second floor we headed down to the first floor and checked out the accesories. Our fet began to hurt again and we determined that the wicker garden swing looked really appealing so we sat there for quite some time. We did the usual down there, found the curtain rods and rod ends that Beth liked as well as the curtains, probably (it'll cost almost $150 with tax if she gets all the curtain stuff she wants). But then we were thrilled when we saw the perfect duvey cover for her room theme. It is completely red with these little flower things and cute little oriental loops and knots. It is beautiful. Just to make sure that it would look really good on the frame we carried it all the way to the double bed version of the frame to make sure, we got some wierd looks but damn it did look good!  I threw out the idea that black satin covers would probably look really good with the red and beth thought so to. We prety much finished it from there and headed to the bistro for frozan yogurt. I wanted to stangle a mother there, she was talking to her child like an idiot. I was frigtened how does this woman expect her child to grow up with a decent vocabulary?   We travelled over to Linens'N Things and saw some neet stuff but really spent our time searching for the bathroom (the one at Ikea was closed) The thing was hidden. We did see this really cool bed tent made of velvet, gauze, and beading, it was great! beth plans on saving up for it.   There was nothing spectaculare about Home Sense. They did bother me with the fact that they already had halloween stuff up. Really that is pretty bad, it's the beginning of August. After that we begged my dad to pick us up because both of our feet were crazy sore. I'm blistered all over. my feet. We vegitated for some time after, on my bed. It was good. We just sat there, blah. Yay. Then beth headed home, I think that she is stopping at Wal-Mart to chek out the different shades of beige.   Well I'm off now.

      I now have nintendo in my room, this may hurt my editing. Maybe I too should keep an editing blog... It may work. We'll try it the day after I've done some editing.   I am having pie for dessert. This is pathetic. I should be eating all healthy and stuff but no, I'm eating pie. I least I'm eating fruit!  I get to go to the school today, i.e. the martial arts school. It'll be nice to work out with out the burning heat. I think I will like that. I figure it will be about two more weeks in the mix class then I will upgrade to the advanced class again. Well maybe three weeks. I'll do this week mix, and then... Never mind I may have to go advanced next week because I'm working at science world until 4:30, it takes about... Wow I'm going to have to haul my work out stuff around with me when I go to Science world on Tues/thurs or I won't be able to work out, and I really don't think that I should just stop for two weeks. This is going to be difficult. maybe I'll do tuesday, and then work out Friday... What ever I'll do what seems right.   Ho hum pies done I think I'll go and eat some breakfast now.   That is the last bit of sugare that I will eat for awhile... I say this now...

      My poor poor bethie. Of course I will refrain from phoning! I've been there before. Normally my mother manages to "forget" that sort of thing. But when she doesn't OUCH!  Maybe this is why she wouldn't let you come over to my house tonight and "forgot" to answer her phone.  I feel very very bad for you. You were very tired last night. If you hgad been in a better frame of mind maybe a little less forgivable but it sounds like you were rather sleepy. You realise that if you have that conversation it's all going to turn around on your sleeping habits.   My daddy's uncle died. Very sad, he heard about it today at about seven. I hate it when adults are in misery, it seems so unnatural. i comforted him for awhile and then he told me a bunch of stories about his uncles. They were really funny most of which I've heard before but I got over that because they are really good and becasue he needed to talk.   OH! Bethie! Ya go for the Sears bed... Wait but the Ikea bed would go so much better... But the Sears bed... ikea... Sears. AAAAAHHHHHHH! I know what you mean.   Well  dinner is coming up so I had better go.   Crap I need to call Cate. I keep forgetting.

      I am officially mexican. Yes my mother has forced me to be a berry picker. I have spent the better half of this afternoon picking berries and my arms tell me that they have never been so scratched in their lives (although I'm sure they have).   This should be really quick because I have to de-sweat and de-juice before I go to this BBQ today.   I had a really great talk with Bethie yesterday. It was great just to chat again. If you are big on the whole "allow same sex marriges" deel (as I am) then go check out laurell K hamilton's blog. I jsut read it and she is absolutely right.   Well again I must shower so Ciao!
