      It's been one of those days where everything is setting me off.  I got a new job in the company, and instead of congratulating me, a co-worker says, 'so what made you decide to abandon the sinking ship?'  WTF??  Who is she to decide that my job is that bad (it isn't I just want to learn something new)?  Then, another co-worker lost some papework I gave her, so she decided that it was easier to just say that I never gave it to her.  Yeah, too bad I have proof that I did.  Dumbass.   I keep thinking about the one thing that I shouldn't.  Jim. I keep wondering if I'm still infatuated/in love with him, or do I just feel bad for the horrible way I treated him?  Which is it?  Love or guilt?  And I know that I'll never know, the chances of us ever getting back together are nil, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about it all the time.  Some fools never learn I guess.  I ended up oversleeping this morning, it is lovely to sleep in!  At least one good thing happened today.

      So, a little about where I work.  I work for a fairly large bank, processing market trades for trust accounts.  It is, as I'm sure you can imagine, cubicle hell.  The girl in the cube next to me is quite possibly the dumbest person I've ever met.  Common sense dumb.  She's fairly intelligent academically, but no 'street sense'.  She spends most of her days arguing loudly with family members on the phone, taking cigarette breaks and telling everyone else how to do their job.  She's the utility clerk, so she assumes that she knows everything about everything.  Funny, when she has to cover someone else, she always screws it up.    Other than her, everyone else at work is great.  Sometimes people get petty about things, but that happens everywhere.    Like on the bus I ride to work for example.  There's always a guy in the back, stretched out asleep.  The driver always has to make sure that he wakes up in time to get off at his stop.  Then, there's the 'Lilt-Lady'.  You've seen her before.  She has the tightest home perm in history.  Poodles have more relaxed curls than she does.  All that home perming has put her in a foul mood, and everyone who dares to get on the bus after she does is rewarded with one of her withering stares.  God help the poor sap who sits in her spot on the bus.  She likes to sit up front in the same spot every morning.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's the way she throws daggers at anyone who gets that spot before she does.  The second they get off the bus, she's flying into that seat like a vulture staking out a claim, waiting for the best carcass to come along.  On one of the message boards I post on, we've been discussing the marriage of J-Lo and Marc Anthony.  One poster is getting pissy because the rest of us have commented that we dont' think the marriage will last very long, that she seems to be a media whore, etc.  He keeps telling us 'this happens everywhere, not just Hollywood.  Why is it a big deal? Just leave here alone'.  Well, helloooo...she's a celebrity and has chosen to live her life in the public eye.  Anything she does is going to be subject to scrutiny.  She gave up some expectation of privacy when she chose this life.  I wonder if Ben A. really had bronchitis or was just depressed about her marriage?  I wonder if he's really wearing a hairpiece?

      This Monday is shaping up to be like most others.  I stayed up too late on Sunday night doing laundry and over slept this morning.  I'm trying to lay off the caffeine so I feel like I'm walking in slo-mo.  It's hard to concentrate when I'm like this, my mind wanders around a lot.  One thing I keep wondering back to is the whereabouts and wellbeing of the first guy I ever loved, James F. Jennings.  I wish I had been smart enough to know I loved him at the time.  He crushed on me in high school, and I thought I was too good for him, 'what would my friends think?!'  Hindsight being what it is, I know now what I should have known then.  Everything happens for a reason, doesn't it?  In a way, I would love to know what my life would have been like if Jim and I had ended up together.  It probably wouldn't be as good as what I imagine it would be would it?  Anyway, he's married now, with kids, I'm married with a son.  My husband and I get on ok, but is ok the best I can hope for?  I love my husband, I know he loves me, and I live and die by my child.  Is this as good as it gets?  One thing about writing, it gives you a chance to see how shallow you really are.

      Keeping a journal is a little like talking to God.  You have a lot you want to say, but don't really know what to start with, and you don't want to sound like you rattle on about nothing.  This should be a good place to keep all my rattles about nothing and everything.  We'll see what happens.
