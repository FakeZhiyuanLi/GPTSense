      Bored bored bored. No one is online. And it is just my mum and me at home. Have resorted to more quizzes. Damn you Quizilla!    Indie rock!  You're my most favourite type of music...  Your music channels lots of emotion. On the top it seems simple, but underneath there's always a deep meaning...  As your name you're independent from most of music!  Stay that way!  Good on you!  There's so much variation in your style...from deep and thoughtful like The Stills, to happy go lucky like Belle & Sebastian, to dancy and catchy Franz Ferdinand, and back to boogie down Hot Hot Heat and The Rapture...    urlLink   What genre of rock are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Fun stuff! I am indie rock and I lurve indie rock. Maybe I do like Quizilla...    You're addicted to.....  Nothing!  Your addicted to nothing at all? Well..... ok I guess thats a good thing but come on just think of the possibilities!    urlLink   What are you addicted to? (pics!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Find this extremely hard to believe. Especially because I have been taking these quizzes compulsively for the last twenty minutes. I definitely should not have started this Dave... it was a very bad idea!   urlLink     What Finding Nemo Character are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    It's Nemo!!! Hahahahaha! I am a Nemo!    You're chocolate.  You're the old soul type, people feel that they have known you their entire life.  Many often open up to you for they view you as thoughtful and trustworthy.  Although people trust you, you have a hard time trusting them.  You prefer to keep your feelings bottled up inside, or display them very quietly.  It is alright to open up every once in a while.    urlLink   Which kind of candy are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Well, if I had to be any kind of candy I am glad to be chocolate. Hmm, I am actually rather hungry. Just a couple more quizzes then.    Congrats! Your a Pure Angel! Angels, as far as most of them go, are all compatabile creatures, but Pure ones simply are symbols of God. Pure Angels always appear when a child is born, when a rainbow is seen, or when someone shares their first kiss. They never grow old, an can appear in the shape of a naked woman with white, bold wings. Pure angels are the carriers of god, and show their love to everyone in the world.    urlLink   What Kind of ANGEL are you? (For Girls only) This Quiz has amazingly Beautiful Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    I don't think I like the whole god thing but the picture is pretty!     You belong in the land of darkness, otherwise known as one of the worlds in which I dwell. All here is beauty inspired by tragedy and great sorrow. Write or go through other creative outlets to express the anguish you may be feeling, and never let anyone tell you that you are just being 'weepy' or full of 'teenage angst'(if you're a teenager.If not, then they really should be punished for calling you one. They probably are trying to insult your maturity...fools.)and always remain yourself, dark and amazing. Never change.    urlLink   Where do you belong?(ANIME IMAGES)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Erm, right then. A little scary. I think I will go relax and be tired and watch movies and eat some lunch. Yay! May post more later, may not. My back is very sore. I am in need of some chiropracting!

      Well, blog numero deux. Je ne parle pas le francais. I have made a new blog because people were asking me about the other one but some of the stuff I have written in there is a little personal. So yeah I dunno. But here I am! I'm listening to Death Cab for Cutie's Transatlanticism. This CD is so beautiful and pretty. It's also really sad. Really sad. =( But it is a good sad. Cause there is such thing. At least as far as I know there is.  My brother has cut his hair. It is um, well it's interesting anyway. It is Davey Havok's hair from AFI from four years ago. I told him that he should have waited a little longer so that he could have had retro hair. I mean, retro! He didn't take too kindly to that and I know have some lovely red marks on my arms to show for it. Thanks a lot jerk boy! Actually got to talk to people online last night which was nice. Normally I am asleep by the time that anyone fun is one. Excluding Diana who is on more often than that. Yay Diana!!! So I got to have sorta human contact. I guess it is more computer contact but I don't care. It is just like talking to people only I don't have to talk. Which is good because I have decided that I don't like my voice. I may just take a vow of silence. Hahahaha, how long do you think that would last? Less than an hour even if I was home alone and the phone was off. Yeah, I don't need people around to talk. Shhh... I need to get to writing people some email... Sorry Erin! I was supposed to do this yesterday, and normally I would have but a lot of other stuff came up yesterday. So that has become my action plan for the day. Write emails and watch movies and do nothing. By the way, thank you Kirsti!!! For the awesome movie selection. Started Ferris Bueller's Day Off yesterday ("When Cameron was in Egypt's land... Let my Cameron go.") and Finding Nemo today. Fun fun fun! Well that is all for now. Sorry bout the short post but it is almost lunch and I am hungry. More later...

      I have started to wonder about the lyrics that I stole the website name thingy from. And I am thinking that they might just be about cocaine. Soo, um yeah. I don't use cocaine. I just liked the lyrics in the song. Go death cab for cutie. Of course it will likely turn out that the song isn't actually talking about that but whatever. I am allowed to have my silly little thoughts whenever I feel so inclined.  Kirsti was over today! No more isolation! It was nice and weird at the same time to have someone else around. No offense meant it was just the first time in a realllly long time that anyone has stopped in for longer than an hour. Or in the psychologists case a little more than an hour. I wonder if you have to pay  extra if he stays for longer than one hour. I don't really care. I would prefer to never ever ever have to see him again but we all know that thanks to my darling mummy I will have to make a return visit. But I have held her off awhile longer using my I-can't-be-bothered-to-get-up-that-early excuse. Long live mono. Just not in me. By the way, Tyler/Kandis I AM NOT A MONOFACE!! Okay maybe I am but its not nice to point out others faults! Jokes. All jokes. The phone will not stop ringing. First it was my dad. Which was nice. He gets to watch a movie tonight. But sadly, it is Along Came Polly which we watched about a million times the week before he left. I miss him so much. "I need you so much closer" ~transatlanticism. Then it was Star Records in Oshawa calling because my brother's Tiger Army thing came in. I don't really care but whatever. Then some friend of my parent's called. Why do people call but never for me? It must just be a thing. Oh well. Kirsti and I watched part of School of Rock. That movie is so funny. Well in its own little way it is.  Thinking of lyrics, I think that Transatlanticism by Death Cab for Cutie is the prettiest song ever. Its just so nice. Plus I could probably play the piano part. I'm also liking, whatsit, um, Televators by the Mars Volta. Right, thank you Tyler! And screw you sibling, I can like the same music as you if I want to. And sometimes I do. So come on. Riddle me this... Rhymes with Lackey Down (two words, Quentin Tarantino). Good freaking luck. It is tricky.  We also conquered Candyland today. Or at least the shareware version. Rainbows all around. The cute crows and scary gigantic spider. But we are the masters of rainbow death madness! Or at least Kirsti is. I am like a master in training. And walked into the angry sea and it felt just like falling in love again. How true. Anyway, I grow tired of typing and really just being tired. But I still am. Once again I am posting a very short little post. I am sorry. But the days seem to interfere with my having no life and being on here all the time. As of Monday morning though it is back to normal for the week, anyway. And on Friday, I have Lore's dance thingy. And sometime near the end of next week Laura and I are hitting the movies. Harry Potter here we come! I think Kirsti is coming too. Very exciting cause I haven't seen Laura in well maybe by now its years. Time does fly when you are having a ...Well, time flies. Whatever. Good night Ladies and Gents! Or rather good evening! Good something anyway.

      Well I decided to get up and go. Only not really because I got up and did nothing. I at least thought about it though. Which almost counts, right? I walked as far as the A&P this afternoon. That was awesome cause I got to see people that I hadn't seen in ages and ages. Like Jess and Lisa. I also got my pictures in from Halifax. If I knew how to put pictures on here I would. They are mostly landscape shots and nothing really too interesting thanks to my camera eating all my film! Stupid camera...  We had to have a mad hunt for my cat Kate today. My mum was on the phone this morning and she thought that she heard Kate outside meowing in a really funny way she said. So we looked around the house and didn't see her but we didn't really think much of it. Hours later, my mum comes inside and she is now really worried about my cat. I wasn't all that concerned because I know Kate is weird so why would she stop being weird just for today? But nonetheless, I still went back through the house and did a proper search. Looking under beds and tables and other things that my hugely gigantic cat would be able to fit under. Which really narrowed down the number of places because she is really fat. I think that my mum was so worried because we thought that maybe Kate had had a stroke because her face was all crooked now. I think that it is just because she is getting pretty old. Eleven is pretty old in cat years I think. Anyway, so my mum seems to think that Kate has gone underneath our deck. I am not so sure because the spaces to get under the deck are small and Kate is not. But I try to look there anyway. I can't see anything because it is all dark and gross. So my mum comes up with the brilliant idea of spraying the entire deck with the hose to see if that would drive out the cat. (!) I do not know what was going through her head. I told her no. I went inside to look around a bit more. When I came back outside she was midway through spraying the deck. No one listens to me around here. Kate is probably just sleeping somewhere. Anyway, out from under the deck comes my cat. Not dead from a stroke but soaked from a hose. Why I ask, does no one ever listen!?! Arg!!!  Anyway, there is not really much else to say. I think I am going to make some dinner cause I am hungry and cause I don't have anything better to do. Might have a nap before the end of the day. I don't know. I would also like to watch Sixteen Candles before I go to bed. But that really is planning too far ahead. I'll get to it if I get to it. Which I probably won't. Oh well. Mac and cheese here I come!  Also, my mum is playing her music insanely loud so I can't even hear mine at full blast with my headphones in. I am going now, to turn it way down.

      Its early yet but here goes. I am writing anyway cause I won't be able to write later cause I am going out to dinner at Kate (not the cats) and Paul's. So that will be that.  Dru went out to a friends birthday last nite and mum drive out there to get him. In the middle of nowhere. Like twenty five minutes each way by car. She gets there and oops, he forgot to mention that he was staying over and he did try to call you know. Yeah so that was that. I hadn't really done much yesterday other than the Grand Cat Hunt of 2004. So I was all geared up with no place to go. Kirsti pulled through though and out to the movies we went. Saw the Terminal. It was all right. Funny and cute and pretty much exactly what you would expect from a Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks picture. Nothing really surprising. But it was still fun just to be out of the house. Cause I haven't been in so long! And I stayed awake! Sweet deal!  I am thinking of going up to the coffee shop for lunch. Mmmm bagel and cream cheese. (lol, Kandis) Er, yeah I really do love bagels though. When my dad gets back from rehab I will try and figure out how to put pictures up in here. He has the one of me where I have a bagel with cream cheese for a smile. And what is there not to smile about when you have a bagel? All right I think that I have taken that far enough. I'm like two lines away from agreeing to marry a bagel, and lets face it, that it not a good idea cause it would go mouldy after awhile. Have started to think about university and money. (way to go dave!) And there is going to be none. Money that is there had better be university or I am going to be really sad and work forever in a grocery store, which is fine. I really like my job and it is a good place to work. I was just hoping to get a different job, like a journalist or a photographer or something I dunno. We shall just see. That cardboard box just keeps sounding better and better! With windows and everything Al! Oh well, I am getting hungry cause it is almost twelve and with all the conversations I have going it has taken me a really long time to type this out. So I need food. I hereby declare today, Take Yourself Out For Lunch Day. Or if you don't read this before lunch, Dinner. Whatever flips your burger. (flashback to grade eight which is a really long time ago. I mean my brother is done grade eight and *shudder* he will be at my school next year. Lovely) Well, toodles I am off.  PS. Failure by Design by Brand New is a really not that good song. Brand New, I expected more from you. Pop Punk, I ask you???

       Then last night I had that strange dream  Where everything is exactly as it seems.   ~the Postal Service  Really really bored. Really. I did nothing with my day today. Had to go to my brother's Grade 8 graduation. Ooh, better story actually. But I had better start at the start for this one.   I woke up at around eleven thirty, still in my pajamas I went on the computer. Right then. So I talked to Rachey and Kirsti and Kandis for a bit. Anyway, the day wore on and I ended up spending the whole day on the computer. Very bad. Very very bad. I dunno why I did that but I did. Anyway, so many crazy funni conversations were had. Hot with two t's. Yikes is a funny word. Assface. Etc. Pure hilarity really it was. I dunno. But yeah it was good.   Then I get a call from my mum and I have to go buy my brothers hair dye and then dye his hair. Yeah, so that was super fun. Anyway, this meant that I actually had to get dressed. It was about three thirty and I was still in my pj's. It was awesome. Awesomely lazy but nonetheless, it was. So I got dressed and walked up to my mummy dearest's place o' work. Picked up the deviant brother. Lovely. Anyway, we manage to fight and argue the whole way to the drug store to buy his hair stuff. Even better. So I buy the damn stuff and we head off to the little hole in the wall we call home. Ha ha ha! Dyed his hair and my arms and part of my face. It was a miserable little excursion. Miserable. Or course his hair turned out really nicely thanks to moi! Black and beautiful!   Then I had to go to brother's graduation. Oh my god. That was soo boring and long. I couldn't even believe it. It just kept going and going like that stupid little pink bunny on TV. There were soo many awards. And they all went to the same like five people. Just keep them up there and give them all the awards at once. It would be much easier and quicker and it would have saved me from almost falling asleep about a billion times. Yikes. lol Rach and Kirsti. That is all.  Fuck, I did have a point to this stupid little story and it was supposed to be funny. But I forgot it and it isn't now. Damn it! And Kirsti isn't even here, so I'll have to take the blame for my own stupidity. But really our two head are dumber than one. Jokes Kirsti! It's all good! But we are hardcore losers!  Okay well I am sorry that this went horribly awry. Damn memory.   G'night!   I am thinking it's a sign that the freckles  In our eyes are mirror images and when  We kiss they are perfectly alligned.  ~the Postal Service

      Another Saturday. Well this is fun and exciting. Not. I'm just sitting here wearing boxers and a tanktop, thinking that maybe I should get dressed for the day. It is around eleven. I likely will not get dressed for the day until, well later if I do at all. Unless I go out. Then I really should get dressed. We'll see. I have decided to just throw some pants on and leave the tank top alone. I think. Mum and brother have gone out to get a record or something in Oshawa. Yeah, he planned it so that they would be there when the store opened. A little overexcited? Perhaps. I want a popsicle and I think I am going to walk to A&P later when I know that good people will be in. No offense to the morning people I just prefer to go in when I know some of my friends will be working so that I can say hello. Yeah. I really have nothing to say. Surprising, I know. But it is still early and there is plenty o' day left for me to have a shocking story to tell by tomorrow. Or later depending on my day. We shall just have to wait it out and see.

      Here at home. Still bored. Still tired. I am just killing time until something better comes along. Unlikely to happen. I managed to walk all by myself to A&P today. Very exciting. I saw Julie and Erin. They are so much fun! Almost makes me want to go back to work sooner. I was talking to Julie and I had just bought some popsicles. And she was saying how she really loved popsicles and apple juice when she is sick. I have told them that I will be back in a couple weeks. I am really hoping that I manage okay. I am almost sure that I will but hey you never know really. I saw Mr. Beatty in the parking lot on the way home. He had his baby with him and the baby is soo cute. Well I guess he isn't really a baby anymore but whatever. Anyway on the way home I didn't even think of the apple juice thing until I was turning into a convenience store to buy some apple juice. And you know what it was good. Actually Julie leaves soon for her big trip. So when I finally start back at work she will be gone. Sad. Oh well, she will come back eventually. And I'll still have Erin. Yay! Well, I am trying to write stuff that is important in here but I can't really think of anything. So I guess that is all for now. Not going to be anything else today as far as I know... But that isn't very far.

      Well, there are forty five minutes left until mummy dearest gets home and I have only put away the dishes and hung out the laundry. I am thinking that making my dad something should likely come next because we are mailing that before we go out to dinner, which by the way is going to suck and I don't want to go. My back is incredibly sore and Kirsti didn't show up on her lunch. Grr...I'm sure I will see her later then. Still haven't written to Erin so that is not good. I will have to write her tomorrow which will actually be interesting because my mum will be home all day with me so there will be a lot less in the way of posts because she hates the sound of typing for some reason. And we have a loud keyboard.  So that is my life for the day, I have things to do so right after I post some lyrics (just because I feel like it!) and a poem I wrote, I will get to doing some stuff.  To the Dancer in the Rain ~Emilie Simon I didn't believe in anyone  but I found you today my eyes are now closed babe as to remember if my words are not that clear I know my heart is understanding every little kiss of you. I'm your princess for a night maybe forever we were dancers in the rain  and it still remains if my words are not that clear I know my heart is understanding every little kiss of you.   I let my mind drift and for some reason  it always finds you across time, galaxies whatever the path brings quantum leaps over mountains and canyons it stops at nothing I stop at nothing just for a glimpse of the flawed perfection I find in you. ~by me  see like I promised I am going now to do stuff. I have wasted enough time here today. Ooh, one more thing, I was watching Last Comic Standing last night and there was this guy on there and his joke was "I work at Bed, Bathroom and Beyond. I work in the Beyond department." I thought it was really funny because I feel like I belong in the Beyond department somewhere. Its probably more fun than the other two anyway.

      Doubt that there will be many postings tonight as I am being forced to endure dinner with my mum and dad's friends at their place of residence. Granted they have a pool, but I have a nasty bruise that I am not feeling like exposing as of yet. Anyway, it'll be nice for my mum to get out and see some people other than us and the people from her work. I come to the conclusion that I just generally want a guy. It is non-specific. Or at least it had better be because I am not(read:no way in hell) going back to the ex. I was seriously contemplating that but it would be a very very bad idea. Almost as bad as the one that started me going out with him. Yeah that was really bad. I talked to Erin last night and she is trying to get over someone also. There is a very sexy musician in her future though. That is one thing that I definitely do not have. If only... A sexy musician would be really nice. Just think about it, a gorgeous sensitive musician. That really would be perfect but it is also really too bad that it will not be happening. Especially because the only musician guys I know, while be very cute, are also very taken. Being in the school band does not count. I want a rock and roll guy, if anything.  I am expecting a visitor who is still not here. Which is making me sad because I am hungry and would like to eat lunch. Plus I have a huge list of stuff I have to do before my mum gets home in three hours.  1.) Write Erin an email because my other friends don't listen but she promised to. Will talk about stupid guys. Because some of you are very stupid. Not all. I am not that bitter anymore! 2.) Have to hang out laundry. I hate the sun so will have to wear sunscreen to avoid and burn and eventually an allergic reaction. 3.) Put away all the dishes and do the ones that are in the sink. I hate doing dishes. It is revolting and disgusting.  4.) Make my dad a Fathers Day gift or at least a card. He still hasn't phoned so, we haven't been able to ask if the patients are allowed to receive mail. We are hoping that they are but hey you never know. And it has to be mailed toady so I have to do this if nothing else. And really I have to do everything else because if not I will be in serious trouble from my lovely mum. 5.) Try to start cleaning my room as it is a filthy mess again. It should only take the rest of the summer. All right, so that isn't that much but I should go now and start to make a dent in at least some of those things. So, cheers!

      Well I am just here to marvel at the wonderful timing of my outbreak of mono. Couldn't really have been any better. So while all my school friends are off at school writing killer exams I will be here at home, either asleep or watching some day time TV. Lovely! I do feel sad that they are stuck there you know, doing really boring stuff. But it is really quite awesome that I don't have to. Good luck to all though. Especially all my best friends. Even though no one is probably reading this cause you all have better things to do with your time but whatever! I am finally on the computer after three when my brother gets home from school. It is much better because there are actually people online. Of course they are all busy what with studying and all but still. They are online and that is what counts.  I need some new friends. Yeah I should work on that. That'll be my plan the next time I am in a social situation. Which is not likely to be soon. Damn I hate this. But no exams. Though also no friends. It appears to be a rather tricky situation. I think I need some advice on this one.

      I just ate an atonishing and disgusting amount of pizza.  Especially considering how I am sick and not really hungry. Oh well, four pieces can't do that much damage. I think I am going to be sick. Yech...  I have decided that Rach is in fact wrong. The eighties are not scary at all. They are in fact quite wonderful. All the neon clothing and brite lights. And all the fab music. Of course all the AIDS and scary drugs weren't good but there is always a downside to things. Anyway, I think yesterday I may have mentioned that I loved eighties music. Well, I think that my favourite song from the late eighties is We Didn't Start the Fire by Billy Joel. Yes, it is not just a grrreat song but it is also a grrreat history lesson. In grade ten, my history teacher gave us an optional assignment to research every term used in the song. It took ages and ages and ages. Mostly because at that point our computer sucked and the internet did not work properly so I had to go to the library to do my research. But whatever. I am so over that. I think my favourite line is "pope paul malcolm x british politician sex jfk blown away what else do i have to say?" Yeah that is definitely it.   I am writing my erstwhile friends yet another email. I think that they are likely very sick of me by now but I don't care. I need things to do and writing to them is pretty much it. That and writing here and writing stories.  Well, I am going to go watch a movie. That I may or may not have downloaded illegally. We'll say not. I will write more later when I have watched the film. Cheers =)

       My pet angel has a long lost friend. Says he's coming back when the world ends. When us humans have lost our touch. God never liked people that much  ~Sarah Slean "Angel"  Parents can be so frustrating. Actually just family in general. After Sandy stopped by earlier, one of my dads so called friends came here. So I opened the door for him but he stayed outside the front porch type thing. He was just here to bring back a CD that belonged to my dad. He said he ws sorry about the way that things had gone down. Yeah all righty there buddy, get out. Not that he was in. But whatever. So fine. He leaves and awhile later I call my mum just to say hello. She is at work so I called her there. She was busy so someone said that she would call back in a bit. Anyway, I continued on with my usual lunch time routines. I made my lunch. Kraft Dinner with the noodles boiled for so long that they become mush. Exactly how I like it. I sit and start watching Law and Order. And then my mum calls back. And she is absolutely furious that I opened the door for dad's friend. I mean irate. She asks how many times she has told me not to open the door. I tell her truthfully never because she has never told me anything of the sort. Ridiculous. She just gets angrier and angrier. So I decide that this is stupid and tell her that I just phoned to say hello and now she is getting all mad at me. She says that yes she is getting mad at me because she didn't think that I was that dumb to open the door for a scumbag (yeah she actually used those words... a hopeless case). So I said that I would talk to her later because she was making me feel incredibly angry. And goodbye. So I was so mad by this point I was ready to just start crying. And I did. Right over my Kraft Dinner. Doesn't really make for an appealing meal. It's just so stupid. If she had told me that I wasn't allowed to open the door for people then I wouldn't have opened it. But I am seventeen. It's not like I am some infant who has to be watched over all the time. I am perfectly capable of handling myself with people. I have done it many times before and will again. There is so much that she doesn't even know about me. And I never plan on telling her. She only found out about this guy because he wanted to meet my family. And after that she didn't mention him again. She didn't even notice when we broke up. I was sitting at the computer which is in a central location in my house, crying. And no one noticed. It wasn't just my mum who didn't notice. Not a single person in my house noticed. That just made me feel even worse. Yeah so bad memories. I just feel like shit. I miss all my friends so much. I just want to be better and get drunk. Hahahahaha, I mean it, that is the only thing that I am really looking forward to about not being sick anymore. That and going outside and concerts and such. But me, Erin, and Kirsti all together, all drunk. It'll be a nice little vacation from feeling sick, that is right up to the hangover. Oh well. No matter.  I think I will go now. Before my brother gets home and he starts complaining because he wants to go on the computer. Life sucks today. It has to get better from here. I am hoping for a series of fun emails from best pals tonight. Later...   I guess it's better that you trapped yourself in your own way. And if you want me back you're gonna have to ask.   ~the Used

      Now playing: White Flag by Dido It is early. Or at least for me right now it is. Haven't seen too many eleven a.m.s lately. Not for lack of trying but the whole mono thing kinda puts a damper on not sleeping. But as I sit here (alone as usual) I am laughing away because I am sitting at home updating my blog while all of my friends and other people in my age bracket are off at school. Learning things that they will never again use. Of course they also get to talk to people other than their dog and their computer. It's a sad little existence but it a good one. At least for now it seems that way. I am not thinking about the guy... All right I am but I am trying really hard. It's just that certain little things remind me of him sometimes. Not in a ooh-I-miss-him kinda way. More of a wow-I-was-incredibly-stupid-for-going-out-with-him sorta way.  Now playing: Buried Myself Alive by the Used I am very into music. Almost all types. Not country though. AltCountry I can take but actual country... There is just something so sappy and cheesy about it. Now I know people who are going to be very angry that I said that so apologies in advance. This is just one girl's opinion. Let it go! I don't know I just like a little variety. I like it when I am writing because different songs can stimulate different thought processes. I am really fascinated by people's reactions to music. A really well constructed sad song can move someone to tears. Or even a happy song that has some connections.  Now Playing: Kiss by Prince Actually, I have a variety of songs that rather than make me sad, make me really quite angry. I guess it's the connection thing. But no more of these songs. Which is sad because I have ruined a fair number of mix CD's for myself by putting these on there a long time ago and now I can't listen to these tracks. Breaks up the flow. These songs are: I Believe in a Thing Called Love by the Darkness, This Love by Maroon 5 and Laid by James. Now in principle they are all very good songs. Especially the last one , which was sent to me by someone who was very important to me at the time. My how things have changed. I try not to associate certain times with music now because it can ruin a perfectly good song. Now Playing: Where do you go by No Mercy Yeah so I am a child of the eighties. Actually I am child of the nineties but because my parents were nineteen and twenty when they had me in '87 they were the children of the eighties. So I got exposed to all their lovely music. I absolutely despised it during my I-am-so-much-cooler-than-everyone-I-know phase in Grades four through to about grade eight. I was quite the little snob. So once again apologies to all the people I was really horrible to because well, I was stupid. I really do love this song.  Now playing: Angel by Sarah Slean desperation and the end of the world. Two themes that scare the shit out of me. Especially the latter. I think that it is possible that I am a deeply disturbed person. Who spends time thinking about the end of the world? I guess its down to me and Morrissey. Will the world end in the day? At night? Well, that's about enough of that. As I am home alone and there is no one to console me if I have a breakdown. Also there is no one home to make me melty grilled cheese. Or run to the store when I run out of chocolate popsicles. Or sit and watch Law and Order with me and try to predict the ending. Sadly, being able to predict Law and Order endings is about the only upside to being a police officer for my dad. Downsides in this case include: post traumatic stress disorder, always distancing yourself from people you care about as well as addictions. Yeah so that is why I am all alone because my dad has had to go off to rehab yet again. So that is a downer. I miss him but there is nothing I can do. He can't even call for the first few days. And he left on Saturday. So maybe in a couple days.  Now playing: Femme Fatale by Emilie Simon My friend Sandy just stopped by for her tupperware. I got cake in it a long time ago. From the cake auction at school. I do kinda miss school. But mostly just the people from school. I haven't even talked to my best friends in days. Which is sooo abnormal for us. Before I got sick it used to be that a day never passed without me talking to at least one of them. Now I haven't seen Kirsti since my birthday and Rach since two or three days after that. And neither of them are ever online anymore. But I am a strong person and will survive despite little or no human contact. Or at least I think I will. Now playing: Change Clothes by DJ Danger Mouse (Jay Z) Well, I am tired and I think I should start in on some lunch. Thank god that my wonderful (*ahem*) sibling and his little friend came by yesterday and I bribed them into going to the store and getting me some Kraft Dinner. My all time favourite food well that is next to melty grilled cheese. But that is not going to be around for the next eighteen days or so. I need a massage. My back is sooo sore. I think it is from falling asleep on the couch so much. I should stop doing that. Not very likely. Now playing: Blackout by Muse I will say my goodbyes from high atop this tightrope. As the gentle breeze makes me fear not only for my life but for my fleeting sanity. It is a delicate balance. One that makes me incredibly nervous. But then again, these days what doesn't? There are stories waiting to be written. All I have to do is find them. I know that they exist out there somewhere. Maybe one day I will put some of them in here. I think my blog could use a little artistic merit. But there is no guarantee that this can be achieved through putting my mundane little creations here. They deserve to be out and in the open. But if they weren't tamed by me then who? It is better this way.

      Still bored. Still at home. Still irritated with my sibling. Feeling slightly better about the situation with afore mentioned guy. Will work to reconcile with him while making sure not to fall into the trap of going back with him. Have spent most of my day listening to music. Took a break to wash my hair and put some creme on my scary bruise. Has gotten slightly more scary and purple since last checked.  Need to rent Bridget Jones' Diary as I started watching it yesterday because it was on TV but I fell asleep before it was over. And now I have adopted her irritating way of starting sentences with verbs and therefore never formulating a complete sentence. Yuck. Will henceforth try to stop. I can't change my profile because the link thingy just never showed up so that is puzzling. One more thing to confuse me. Oh well at the rate I'm going I will probably have forgotten within the next five minutes anyway. Lucky for me. Unlucky for me, I have no life. None at all. I did have a life. A rather nice one if I say so myself. But thanks to this little viral disease I have no contact with a lot of my friends other than email. Which sucks because they are all too busy to write me back. But I am all done with self pity. No more I say! Instead I will be a stronger individual. I will start tomorrow. Brilliant plan, self. Brilliant, indeed.

Well, at least now I know what my sex appeal is. Thank you Quizilla... Whatever.  Brothers are extremely irritating. I can't be cool because you are fourteen and stupid! I only have so much patience for you and your friends. Well I think I am actually done here for the day. I am feeling pretty decent about my first day on here. I like it =) Very tired though. Thank you mono!

      I still don't know how to use this site but whatever! Can't be that important.  I am developing a really gross bruise that I somehow got in my sleep last night. Very painful. Almost as painful as stupid people that I know. I don't know if this will make me feel any better but here goes (can't get much worse anyway!)...  I met a certain guy in one of my classes. He was super nice, you know the type. He had a girlfriend already but that was cool cause I wasn't really interested in him like that. Useful for flirting purposes only. For now anyway. So we had lots of fun in class and on MSN. Whatever. And I really start to like this guy. So then his girlfriend breaks up with him for the billionth time. And I am not exaggerating. She does this all the time. And then he immediately starts asking her back. That's his business so I just talk to him about it, try to make him feel a little bit better cause he is pretty upset. Fine. A week or so later I am talking to him and he asks me out. Now I am thinking to myself "Self, this is a bad idea. He just got out of something. So even though you have a crush on him, you really shouldn't. Very very bad idea." But sadly, I like bad ideas. I put it off for a bit but I said okay. Anyway later in the week we meet up and fool around. From bad to worse, self. Bad to worse. So now we are an "item". Lovely. I am actually having a great time. I fall for the guy. And I miss him whenever I can't see him. At this point, my friends are all mad at me for ignoring them and they are all teasing me for making out with the guy in the halls. Because I have become exactly what I used to hate. Enter stage left: self loathing... More fun stuff. But no matter. Because I love this guy and he says he loves me and we are perfect together. At least that is what I keep telling myself. So what if he still talks to the ex a lot. Not important because he loves me now. Right? He meets my mom. Yeah, this clearly shows that I am serious about him because no one guy meets my parents. Except for him now. We are both really nervous but it goes well. And he walks me up to my doctors appointment cause I kinda quit eating. Mostly because it just wasn't important to me anymore. I had better things to do on my lunch hour. And Dinner was never that good to me anyway. Don't even get me started on Breakfast. We get there and he calls me on the fact that I don't like kissing in front of people. He walks home alone in the rain. My parents honk the car horn at him I find out later. And nearly turn purple with embarrassment. Why do I care? I am not responsible for their actions. Anyway, during this whole period of time, the ex keeps emailing him saying that she was going to tell him just the day before we started going out that she wanted him back. The day after the car horn incident, he gets another letter from her. Saying that she just knows that they belong together and she can't live without him and doesn't intend to. She wants to get married and have little babies that are just like him. Well, whatever. He seems totally fine about it. For a bit. Anyway, I see him later on and he says that he doesn't know what to do cause he still loves his ex and she was his first love blah blah blah. Did I mention that she is in grade ten and he is in grade twelve? Ordinarily, this is not a big deal if the grade ten is relatively mature. This is not the case. He says that he is going to have to think about things. Right then and there I should have told him that is he had to think about it, not to bother with me anymore. But I didn't because I really liked the guy. Anyway, long and sad ending short. He thought, we broke up and I was angry. At least for the first ten minutes or so I was angry, then I was sad. Really sad. This guy knew me better than anyone and he still leaves. Nice. "Well, I told you this was a bad idea." I can be very vindictive when I so choose. Anyway many stupid tears later I am fine. I tell him that I think we should still be friends. He thinks that this is a good idea. We should just go back to how things were before we started flirting back and forth. Except therein lies the problem, there was nothing before that. So we settle into a daily routine of not talking to each other. He goes back to making out with her in the halls. I go back to well, not doing that in the halls. Everything is fine.  Awhile down the road, I get mono. Not from him or anyone else (at least that's what I am telling people...) So I miss a lot of school. More than a month. I come back for an afternoon to return books and say hello to people I haven't seen in ages. I see him and tactfully ignore him, as is now customary. When I get to the class that I met him in. One of my friends tells me that him and the girlfriend have broken up again (!). I laugh because it amuses me that I told him this would happen but he chose not to listen. Too idealistic methinks.  Later on that night, I realize that just knowing that he is available has made me start to think about him again. This is not good. Not good at all. But that is where it ends for now because I am trying to avoid talking to him about it. Even though for some reason I now miss him a bit. So that is my sad and incredibly stupid story.   My bruise is getting more and more sore. Whoa that rhymes. Anyway, I have other things to do... All right, I lie but I would like to. Next time I will have happy or funny stories to offset this gigantic downer! Until then...
