       The ongoing  saga of my new fugly mouse at work continues...  Ok so it sucks worse than anything that's ever sucked - we've established that much. So the new story is that without a scroll wheel I'm having to relearn all my habits so my productivity had practically dropped through the floor.  "A mouse makes that much of a difference?" you ask? Yeah, when your job is Internet Recruiting and surfing the web all day, every day. Now stop cutting in will ya?  Anyways, I used this to go to my manager to say "hey this mouse licks bag - can't I just go buy one and expense it?"  Well yes, I got the go ahead on that, but get this - turns out this ugly piece of garbage with 3 buttons and no scroll wheel cost them... *drum roll* $175!! (CAD) WHAT!? For that kind of money I could've gotten myself a wireless, 15 button, gold plated mouse that'll tell me when I need to take a piss just by the temperature of my palm.  So yea, to top it off, apparently my area can't send the mouse back and get a refund on it because it would cost almost as much to return it to this stupid place they got it from.  I nominate  urlLink Contour Design  as the biggest fucking rip off company in the world.

       I managed  to pick up a new mouse again. Yea I took back that Logitech mx700 because it was fucked, but I ended up saving $65 because Futureshop had the Logitech mx500 on sale.  I picked it up for $50 - what a steal!  Exact same mouse as the mx700 except its not wireless.. big whoopty fucking doo!  This mouse is quality.  I am now happy.  On another note, I'm even MORE happy because I picked up Zelda for Gamecube today!!! I haven't had much time to play it but suffice it to say that it ownz me, you and your mom.  I'll be having a serious go at it tonite.  In the meantime, back to the grindstone...

       Regarding  the comments I made this morning about how shitty my new mouse at work looks.. yeah, well, I just took another look at that pic in the link I provided, and while that looks like shit, mine is worse!  The one in the pic is a sleek silver with the odd thumb thing on the side being black. Nice colours sure - I get the white and biege model that you couldn't fucking give away if you tried.  No scroll wheel!? Who the hell makes a mouse with no scroll wheel nowadays? Wait, better question, who buys one!? Yep, you know it - my work.  So, I've been using it for a couple hours now and its seriously the biggest, most clumsy piece of garbage mouse I've ever used. But its comfortable! ......... blegh

       Something  else I want to mention is that  urlLink Microsoft  have released a silent update to  urlLink DirectX 9   "What the hell do I care?" I hear you asking. Yeah, well, I've been fighting this "little" problem that DirectX 9 introduced to my system a while back.  The problem goes something like this - If you run Windows XP, use Windows Messenger, have the built-in XP firewall enabled AND had installed DirectX 9 (note: no "a" on this one), your Windows Messenger would freeze for 5 seconds every GODDAMN FUCKING MINUTE.  Somehow Microsoft overlooked their own software when testing DirectX 9.. maybe the testers went out on a binge and got shitfaced every night. Who knows.  At any rate, they've fixed this problem FINALLY in DirectX 9a.. and thank dog for that!  I knew a little work around that fixed the problem but I won't get into it because its a stupid solution even though it worked.  New solution?  Download  urlLink DirectX 9a  now to end your misery and save the few strands of nappy hair left on your head.

       Happy birthday  to Kitty.  She's 25 today!   So today is the moment of truth - do I get a call from EB about my pre-order of Zelda or not? Does it come in? Can you feel the tension?? Ok, no tension, but I'd still like to get my hands on it today. If not, I'll live.  What the hell else is there to talk about at the moment?  Oh, I got my new "ergo" mouse at work today. The thing is fucking huge and ugly...AND NO SCROLL WHEEL. WTF is that about?!  urlLink Peep this.  It has got to be the crappiest looking mouse ever but its really damn comfy. They got me the Large size one and it fits my hand like a charm. Bah..form over function? Who the fuck thought that up?  Give me a nice pretty MS Intellimouse or a Logitech mouse over this huge piece of garbage.  So what if my hand cramps trying to reach for mouse buttons that are hidden under my palm and I can't straighten my fingers in 20 years time.. they look damn COOL!

       Well  I've returned my MX700 for a refund. I spoke too soon. I still wasn't having any problems the majority of the users complain about regarding the Mouseware software, so I stand by my original comment. My mouse was just defective. I couldn't fully charge it without the mouse dying. The LED would blink and then after 5 mins the LED would go out and there was no turning it back on. I hit the connect button, swapped USB ports, etc. The thing that brought it back to life was leaving it in the base then unplugging the base from the powerbar and plugging it back in. At any rate, there was something seriously wrong with the one I had.  I opted for a refund rather than an exchange because I'd been spending too much money recently anyway.  Its a pity really because I loved that mouse. It's still an excellent mouse and I'd recommend it to anyone.

       Wheeeeeeeee!!  The new  urlLink Zelda for Gamecube  is released either today or tomorrow, but I don't know if I'll be getting my pre-ordered copy that soon. Why you ask?  Well apparently some fuckwit broke into  urlLink Electronic Boutique's  warehouse by..get this..cutting a hole in the fucking roof!  Anyways, I guess he (they?) made off with a ton of shit, and my copy of Zelda could have very well been in their loot.  Sledgehammer to the kneecaps anyone?

       Ok I lied.  I'm going to rave on about my new  urlLink Logitech MX700  because it seriously owns me right now. It has got to be the most comfortable mouse I've ever used. And on top of that, the extra buttons really pay off. You may read about other jerkoff's having problems with the mouseware software, but I've installed and have had zero problems. You want my guess on their situation? Its not the mouse..their problem exists between their chair and their keyboard.  Excellent mouse. I just can't get over how good it is. I used to use the  urlLink Microsoft Intellimouse Optical  and while that was exceptional, the MX700 is even better.  Me likey leaky!!

       Managed  to pick up a Logitech MX700 cordless mouse today. I won't rave on about it (but believe me, I could!).  Instead I'll just simply say - BUY IT. You honestly won't regret it.  Lack of updates recently because I also bought the new Gameboy Advance SP on friday and have been busy playing with that.  Well ok, not all weekend.  Saturday I managed to make it out to the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto.  Cool shit there. I took my Canon ZR40 video camera and was filming a mummy in the Egyptian section. Yeah well a guy who worked there comes up to me and says "It's ok to take pictures but just don't use a flash."  I looked at him and looked down at the video camera I was holding, with the LCD flipped out to the side, and said "Does this look like a camera to you?" Maybe I didn't have to call him on his stupidity and be an ass about it, but I did it anyway, so screw him.

       OMFG!  Sometimes you manage to talk to someone on the internet that is so stubborn and stupid that you just want to reach through the monitor and strangle some sense into him or her.  Its like talking to a fucking wall with these people - they won't acknowledge when they're wrong, their opinion won't change, and NOTHING you can say to them will change that!  So frustrating.

       Wow!  Talk about fog. Holy crap. Its foggy like hell in a thunderstorm today if you haven't pieced that together yet. But get a load of this - some schools are closed because of..FOG!  What the hell? Are they scared kids are going to get lost on their way to school? So stupid.  What's next? "Oh! Someone farted on school grounds this morning. Thats it, close the school!"  Bah..

       You  know when you're at work and you feel a major crap coming on and you try to subdue the beast but no matter what you do, its this unstoppable force that intends on sending you running for the bathroom?  Ok, I had one of those today.  No one likes taking a crap at work.  I don't know what it is - the fact that other people have placed their bare ass on the same spot where you now have to, or the feeling of unfaithfulness to your home commode.  Whatever the reason, theres only one thing thats worse - having no choice but to take a stall next someone else.  I don't know about women's washrooms, but men's usually only have two stalls (or at least they do here at work). I also don't know if this is universal across both sexes, but guy's like that "buffer zone".  No one wants to take the stall next to someone else who's already in there doing their business.  That's where my day comes in. I had to go so bad I'm sure I was walking funny all the way to the can. Anyways, I get in there thanking god that I made it and someone is already in one of the stalls!  I didn't know what to do - do I leave and try to fend of this monster turd until the guy is done or do I just get in the damn stall and suck it up?  Well, I decided to suck it up...partially.  I went in and sat down, and tried to judge how long the other guy had been there. I wasn't hearing anything so I figured he'd been there a while so I tried to pinch it off and wait. Problem?  I think he was doing the same thing!  I think a minute went by in complete silence and the pressure was building up to the point where I could barely hold it any longer, and then just at the last second, I hear him going for some toilet paper.  Ahhh..safe now right? NO! He must've used like 4 pounds of toilet paper!  Pull, pull, pull, rip...pause...pull, pull, pull, rip...pause...  over and over again like 10 times!  I felt like screaming out "what the hell did you do? shit all over yourself?!!"  I swear it took this guy 2 minutes just to wipe his ass!  I figured I'd be safe with the noise he was making and besides, I couldn't wait any longer, so I just let go. But guess what? The increased pressure caused a loud splash. Everything goes silent. Did I get away with it? The guy leaves his stall and washes his hands.  I started to relax thinking now I could just do this in peace. But as he's walking out he stops just outside my stall and I swear to god, the guy says "Take it easy in there, you'll hurt yourself!" and leaves.  Comedians everywhere..

       Quick  little update to the GBA SP silver thing below. I'm getting one now again anyways..  I guess the guy who told Dazzla about that was a shit-eating chimp who was talking out of his ass.  Big D tried one, says its quality, and I trust him.  Simple as that! Silver GBA SP here I come...

       Strangest  thing happened to me yesterday too. I was on the drive home from work and some dude pulls out in front of me, cutting me off a bit but it wasn't too bad so I didn't care. So my gf is in the car and she says to me at one point, "What the hell is he looking at?"  The guy was staring at us in his rear view mirror.  I thought at first maybe he was checking for rogue nose hairs or some shit but nope!  So I'm thinking fuck, why don't you just take a picture asshole? Too cold to put down the window and yell it so I made a stupid looking face for him to look at. Gotta entertain the audience right?  I eventually pass this guy cause he's turning left and he flips ME the bird! What the hell was that about? It only took a second for me to pass so sure enough by the time "that fucker flipped me the bird!" registered in my head, I was already past.  Bah.. retards.

       WTF?  Seems like feedback is filtering back from GBA SP owners and they say the   urlLink silver paint scratches off  . The blue and black are coloured plastic though.  Yea well woopee. This licks balls.   I was looking forward to getting the silver one but now I don't know what to do. The blue one looks gay and the black isn't available in North America.  Stupid ass silver paint /me grumbes

       I swear  work just keeps getting worse.  An increase in workload and bitchy people = grumpy Spyder. Ah well, I'm paid well..life goes on.  So hey, I'm getting one helluva sweet tax return this year.  What does that mean?  Oh, well let me tell you (and especially repeating this just for Dazzla hahaha). At the end of this month, I will be purchasing:  1) The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker 2) The new Gameboy Advance SP  (read about it people!) 3) Metroid Fusion 4) Gameboy-Gamecube link cable  Wha? Me a Nintendo whore? Abso-friggin-lutely!  muahaha

       Dazzla  is the fucking king of digital movie editing! It doesn't hurt that his PC kicks ass too. I mean really..his friggin PC can encode crap at faster than real time! @_@ I need a PC like that. Anyways, I haven't met anyone who knows more about this stuff than he does though. Currently waiting for him to finish up editing a version of Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers into Divx. The man is all about quality so its safe to assume he won't be happy until its perfect.  /me does a Monty Burns   Exxxxxxxxxxxxxcellent!

       w00t  it seems to be working fine. Ok - another person and hopefully this'll be updated more often (knowning Mel it won't be though).  Variety is good, no?  Anyways, I seriously need to upgrade the stereo system in my car. Turns out the wattage of my back speakers are 25W.  25W!!!  That blows! Yes folks, I have a combined grand total of a whopping 50W blaring out of my rear speakers. Blegh! I'm hoping the front speakers are 25W each but I seriously doubt it. Definately something I'm going to be buying in the future, considering my deck is a factory P.O.S. and needs a little something too.

I've been a little wary of it to say the least because it's beta shit after all!  Well it turns out that its not bad at all, so I may just end up keeping it installed.

       I'm currently  unable to sleep. It's been going on almost 2 weeks now.  I wake up 15 million times a night.  Last night I fell asleep at 11pm and woke up WIDE AWAKE at 2:30am - of course, not without waking up 3 times in that short time span.  I wasn't even remotely tired until 5ish am, at which point I crashed from exhaustion I think.  I had to get up at 7:30am though for work.  If I'm not waking up completely during the night, I wake up many times - enough to not get a restful sleep.  Needless to say I'm irritable and have been in a foul mood for a week and a half.  I'm dead tired and all I want to do is sleep. Help me?

       Hmm..  looks like Blogger updated the whole internal interface. Very cool now!  Great work by these guys.  Anyways, the place where I work opened up a new office about 8 months ago about 10 minutes from head office (by car).  Anyways during that time, there's been a ton of car thefts, and 2 of them most recently.. get a load of this part of the notice everyone was sent..  "There have been two recent incidents of auto theft at the 50 Westmount Place parking lot. Waterloo Regional Police say our Waterloo office locations aren't problem areas for theft and "very few things go missing from this area"  uh.. they "aren't problem areas for theft" eh? then how come so many cars have been broken into in the past 8 months?  I think they're full of shit personally.

       Yeah so  to follow up from my brief post on monday, I'm back to work after a week off. Everyone asks "So what did you do?" and most are surprised to hear the answer of "nothing". What's wrong with doing nothing? I'm an avid fan of it. I swear I could do absolutely nothing forever.  Ok, ok.. nothing isn't really  nothing  so to speak. I mean, I'm cruising the net, playing Gamecube or Xbox or something. So I  am  doing  something , but not going to some caribbean isle or climbing a mountain like it seems most people almost expect you to do with time off.  Give me a beer, my GBA SP, a comfy chair to plaster my ass in outside on my deck and I'd be honest when I say that my vacation  was excellent. :-)

So I picked up Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (KoToR) and Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance for the Xbox the other day. Both games are excellent. I especially like KoToR because its a Star Wars RPG based on the Dungeons and Dragons 3rd edition ruleset. Pretty cool if you ask me.  I haven't found a beef with Baldur's Gate yet, but I do have a few minor ones for KoToR..  1) Alien's talk far longer than needed. You have the english subtitle at the bottom and I guarantee you'll be done reading it far far far before the alien stops yammering on his in language.  Luckily you can hit the A button to go to the next thing he says before he's finished. 2) Jaggies. They can be quite bad in some places, but they're forgiveable because of the next point coming up and because the game is just too good to let jaggies be the end all and be all. 3) Framerate drops. Every so often, the framerate drops and things get a little jerky. Its not really bad where its unplayable, but it drops just enough to be noticeable. Likely they didnt implement FSAA to kill the jaggies because the framerate drop would be horrendous then.  Like I said, these are minor gripes. The game far makes up for it in almost every other aspect so far.

        urlLink Neowin.net   is back up folks. Within 5 minutes of its return, more than 200 people were already on the forums. Now that's damn impressive.

       I've decided  to edit this post.  I'm tired as hell at the moment, and theres more drama going on than a day time soap opera.  Makes me want to puke.

       I rented  Midtown Madness 3 for the Xbox on the weekend. Pretty cool game, I found it a lot of fun. One issue though.. the jaggies are horrible in the game! I thought Xbox had full screen AA, so I'm confused as to why the jaggies are so bad.  It's especially bad when selecting your car before the race, but its all throughout the game.  Very fun though regardless. I hear the Xbox Live multiplayer mode is where its at for this game, but I don't see how it'd make the game that much different.

       Ok so  it turns out that I didn't have anything in my eye, and that it was just irritation from the eyedrops I used. Black smudge in my eyesight out of the left eye? Yeah, thats INSIDE my eye. They referred to it as a "floater".. its when a small part of the gel in your eye hardens a bit - just enough that you can see it. Apparently it eventually sinks to the bottom of my eye but that'll take a little while.  Also mentioned I'm a little young for that to happen (25) but its nothing to worry about.  So good news, and bad news I guess.  I do need glasses though, as it appears I have astigmatism, but its minor and I don't need to wear them all the time.  If it helps my headaches, BRING THEM ON!

       I've been  living with something in my left eye now for a week. Or at least I think (and hope) its something in my eye.  I can see a black image, its hard to describe, in my vision and it moves around depending on where I look.  I was extremely nervous to be honest.. worried that it'd be something like the onset of blindness or some other equally bad thing (yea I tend to worry too much). The black semi-transparent blob moves around though, so it has to be something ON my eye, right?  Anyways, I find out today because I have an appointment with the eye doctor. Up until yesterday, the thing was it didn't feel like there was anything in my eye, but finally it does and its irritating the shit out of me.  So I'm praying its something he can just pluck out.  Other than that though, I'm almost 100% sure I'm going to need glasses or something.. my vision just ain't what it used to be.  Fuck.

       I'll never  understand why I subject myself to this. If it wasn't because I need to, I would have said "fuck it" a long time ago. I'm definately looking forward to the time where I no longer need to deal with bullshit.. hell, I'll settle for one full day. Thats not too much to ask, is it?

      Ok, I'll admit it. My marriage proposal to my girlfriend was a little unorthodox in that I didn't have a ring when I proposed. OMFG! Why you ask? I just figured that a woman wears her engagement ring throughout her life, and if thats the case, I wanted to be absolutely sure that she'd like it. We went ring shopping the next day and she picked out something that she liked. It was fortunate that I did it this way actually because I'm almost 100% sure I wouldn't have picked what she did. Not to say its not a nice ring, I probably would have picked something else.  So long story short, we got a great deal, and we ordered the diamond separate from the band (Melissa wanted a specific band so they're going to make it). Anyways, the diamond arrived yesterday and we went to go see it last night. The instant the guy dropped it out of the baggy onto the velvet black cloth, Mel's face lit up. Instant smile! It was great. :) The bonus was that the diamond ended up being slightly better quality than what we ordered, but we get this one at no extra cost. Luck man, luck!! So anyways, now that she's given them a picture of the band she wants (and I've given them more money lol), it'll take about 2 weeks to make and put together. Woot!

      I got an email last night from a beta that I signed up for a while back. It's a 3D chat program called  urlLink There . Now, after I installed it, it was a little overwhelming because theres just so much to do. Thing about the chat community in There is that they're all extremely friendly and helpful. If you have a question, just ask someone.. they're all willing to help and no one is a jerk. I've never experienced that anywhere on the internet before. Ever.  I didn't REALLY start having fun though until I convinced  urlLink NTUser  (a member of the A.D. forum) to join up.  Someone in There had lent me a dune buggy, so I let NTUser drive and I rode shotgun. Let me tell you, stay away fromt his guy if he's driving in your town! LOL He was going off jumps and running over people. It was so damn funny that I was laughing so hard I almost peed my pants.  This chat program is definately worth checking out. Head on over to  urlLink There.com  to sign up and download the client. Be warned though, the download is 100+mb and you need a broadband connection to join in on the fun.  If you DO join up, add Northstar (thats me! Spyder was taken) and NTUser to your buddy list :)

      Holy crap! 2 full weeks of not updating my blog..what the hell is wrong with me? Anyways.. what's news?  I proposed to my girlfriend yesterday and she said yes! :D :D :D  I was confident she would say yes but that didn't stop me from being so damn nervous that my hands were shaking.. whew.  So now, needless to say, I'm a pretty happy guy :)

       Went to   urlLink Niagara Falls  on Saturday. Ok, let me lead in by saying this: If you ever plan on going somewhere, check the weather forecast and find that your destination is currently experiencing 100% humidity, DON'T GO!!  Holy shit Niagara Falls was hotter than hell!  The "felt like" temperature was 38 degrees celcius, and with so much humidity, it felt like a sauna. Not only that, but your sweat wouldn't evaporate.. it'd just cling to you forever if you didn't wipe it away.  Anyways..disregarding the heat, Melissa and I had a lot of fun. I snapped 76 pictures and got about 30mins of video I believe. If you go to see the Falls, you need to visit  urlLink Clifton Hill  at some point. That short stretch of road crams in a little of everything! Check out the link to see what I'm talking about.  The way home was nuts. At one point it started raining so hard that people were pulling over. Clouds were low too..it looked like a tornado was about to form. Got all this on video of course. I'm going to see what I can do about compressing this enough to put it up on the site because its worth seeing!  Related note: I think I'm going to change the "stuff" section into a photography section and post pics I've taken with my digital camera.  Till next time..

       The guys  at Rogers finally figured out and solved my slow internet problem. It was going on 2 weeks and I was getting a little fed up with it to be honest. I pay $45/mth for the service and I was getting a 20kb/s speeds.. normally I'm around 100!  Anyways.. they sorted it out and they're crediting me for "my inconvenience" so all is well in the world again!  Rogers is a great ISP :)

      Wahoo!  urlLink This  is what I intend to buy today. I was going to pick up just the headphone adapter for my GBA SP from Nintendo, but that'll come to about $10 (if not more). For $19.99 CAD I can get that kit that comes with the headphone adapter, some headphones (which I lack), a car adapter for charging on the road AND a protective case. I'm all for it!

      Well I got my JVC home theater kit yesterday. Total installation time? About 4 hours. Geezus! It took a while to run the wire etc so it would be as unnoticable as possible.  Regardless though, it sounds fucking great! I can finally appreciate my DVD's and man, does having a center speaker make a difference! Before with 2 speakers it was hard hearing the people speaking if music was playing. Now the people talking comes out of the center speaker and music comes out of the surround speakers.  Quality.

      ARGH!!!!!!!!!!  I bought a home theater kit from Futureshop the other day. Awesome unit and I couldn't be happier about it.  urlLink (this is it actually)  I didn't pay $549.99 (before 15% tax btw) for it. I paid $321 and change total because I know someone who works there :)  So what the hell is my problem?  I spoke to a guy I know at work here who has his own PC-shop-side-business-type-thingy. Anyways, he's willing to cut me a good deal on a Radeon 9600 Pro! I don't have enough money now to get this, and its a $60 savings.  Sucks eh?

      So yeah, I'm one of those people who do their best to hold it until they get home. I don't know why, I just do. Anyways, today there was no way I could wait so I get to the washroom and think "BONUS! Completely empty!" and I take the stall furthest from the urinals (says the men's bathroom code). Get in, do my business, only to look up and find that theres NO GODDAMN TOILET PAPER!!  Now the most frustrating part about it is that I'm sure one of the main duties of the cleaning staff and/or janitor is to make sure that all stalls always have toilet paper. Well someone fire someone now!  Anyways, so now what? I don't want to pull my pants up over my ass just in case you know? I mean, I was almost positive that it didn't get messy back there but I didn't want to chance walking around at work for the rest of the day smelling like shit.  So there I was, holding my pants up at the front to cover my wang and my ass hanging out at the back, moving as fast as I could from my stall to the next.  Fortunately no one came in and caught me, but I tell you, its for exactly these reasons I HATE pinching a loaf at work.

       urlLink There  & magic pictures. What? Yeah, thought so. Here we go.  There, the fun "chat" program that I've mentioned before, is finally leaving beta. They've announced pricing structures but I'll save me tons of typing by giving you  urlLink this URL . It breaks it all down for you but here it is in a nutshell. Beta members get a flat fee of $30. This includes a lifetime membership to There and all the premium services. If you're NOT a beta member, you have to pay $30 for an activation fee, and $10 a month. This doesn't include the premium services.  What does this mean for you?  If you  urlLink sign up now  and use me as a referral (Northstar), you don't have to wait in line to get approved to enter the current beta. Since you'll be moved up to the front of the line, you'll be able to take advantage of this amazing beta offer! Yes I get something out of it for referring you (Therebucks, the in game currency) BUT you get by far the better deal. No monthly fees. No extra fees for premium services. $30 USD. Period.  So if you wanted to sign up to try it out, do it now. What do you have to lose? It's free currently, and there'll be no waiting line to get accepted if you put in my name (Northstar) as a referral.  If you like it, take advantage of this amazing deal for beta testers!  Oh, I almost forgot  urlLink the magic picture.   Cya!

      Ok get this:  There's a good possibility I'm going to Germany for Christmas this year.  My fiancee's parents moved there because her dad is in the Canadian military...some sort of promotion.  At any rate, how cool is that? They've offered to pay for her ticket as a christmas present, so I just have to get one for myself.  So far prices I've seen are around the $1500 (Canadian) range, so it's pretty steep and thats where the possibility comes in.. if I can afford it, I go. :)  Nevertheless, I'm excited to all hell at the good chance of heading over to Europe for a week or two!

      So I called my local  urlLink EB Games  to find out when  urlLink SSX3  is supposed to be out. They say the 21st of this month, but the website says its out today! I know you're probably thinking "Big deal. It's only one day" but I'm so pumped over this game, its unreal.  It looks so goddamn cool that it makes me go adsoifha;lsdkfjadsf;jklfdsjak;lfdsjl;kfdsa  Yes. Really. Exactly like that. lol  Anywho I'll be picking it up for Xbox over Gamecube me thinks. I read a review over at  urlLink IGN  and it said that its a little easier on controls due to the fact that Xbox controller has one more button. Whoopy!  It'll start to round out my Xbox game library with my GC one.  I have SSX Tricky on GC anyway.  Going to make a few calls to see if I can score it today rather than tomorrow. Wish me luck!

      Mkay so I went to the bank last night to get pre-approved for a mortgage. Found out today I'm approved and I'm going tonight to put an offer on a house!  To be honest I'm freaking out. Its exciting and all, but this is all so much money. The biggest purchase I've ever made was my car, and a house eclipses that big time.  Regardless, I'm happy to have found something that Melissa and I can afford so we can finally have a place of our own.

Regardless, I'm unable to resist temptation and not download the playable Half-Life 2 leaked demo that this person managed to scam as well. I'm downloading it now and hopefully it'll be done sooner than later so I can see a little of what I can expect when the game is released this holiday season. Oh man, I'm definately buying this one regardless.

      So I was watching the news this morning, like I do every morning while eating breakfast before work, and it turns out some  idiot  in New York City has a white tiger in his apartment. Yep! He raised it from a baby, and when they found it, it was a fully grown adult. How did they find out about it? Well the owner went to the hospital because the tiger bit him but he said it was a dog bite and the doctor didn't believe him. 1+1=2 and the cops found the tiger. A HUGE tiger living in one room of this guy's apartment for all its life. What kind of fucking idiot is this guy? Want to hear whats worse? He had a full grown alligator in there too! What baffles me is how his neighbors never knew.  Long story short, the animals were taken and hopefully they're going to some zoo now so they have some space to roam.

The main character (her name escapes me at the moment) kicks some serious ass. That black leather catsuit outfit of hers makes her look sexy, but still makes her look tough. Very cool that they were able to pull that off for her.  Vampires vs. Werewolves rock! I'll be buying this on DVD when it comes out.  Head on over to the forum to talk about this wicked movie!

      Oh.. I forgot to mention.  After a long time with Rogers cable broadband, I'm officially switching to DSL. This should take affect on Wednesday, November 5th. Since Mel and I are moving into our new house on January 30th, I decided not to put the DSL account in my name. What does that mean? No blog until that time, because the webspace given by the new ISP will be used by the account holder. The forum will still be up at  urlLink http://www.timdorr.com/spyder , so if you happen to visit this page once in a while, stop by the forum instead for the next couple of months until I manage to get my own space again.

      I just got back from seeing Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. Without a doubt, this is the best movie of the trilogy!!  I didn't think it could get better but it did. These 3 movies have to be the best movies ever made.  If Peter Jackson doesn't get Best Director now, he'll be robbed plain and simple.  I have to say that I'm sad though now that its all over. I have no movies to look forward to. It'll be a long time coming until any movie is anywhere near as good as one of these.

At any rate, yay, I can update my blog. haha  I've long since got a new computer case - the Antec Sonata. It's extremely quiet. So quiet, in fact, that I can't hear it sitting right next to it. Awesome eh?  Almost Christmas too! Yay. 1 more week of work next week then 2 weeks off for vacation!  Anyways, head on over to the  urlLink forum  and have some fun.

I'll be moving into my new place on the 30th of this month, so hopefully my net connection will be up shortly after that. In which case I'm going to transfer the site over there and leave a single link here for as long as Rogers doesn't delete the space.

      Someone needs to give me a tranquilizer or something. I want  urlLink Roxio Easy Media Creator 7  so damn bad and I have no idea why! I mean, its just burning software for shit sakes. I think I have mental problems. Though to be fair, it looks like a sweet, sweet software package.  Been getting a lot of flak from people who are hardcore  geeks   urlLink Nero  users though. As silly as it sounds, even thinking about using anything else is blasphemy to these people. To ridicule someone over something as mundane as personal choice of burning software is pretty silly, don't you think?

      PITA! Thats what this is.  If you don't know what PITA stands for, think about it for a bit..it'll come to you.  Anyways I feel like a truck ran me over today. I've got some sort of flu and it kept me up for most of the night. Yay me. I hate being sick, I dunno about the rest of you. Someone out there might go "But you get the day off work!".. true, but I feel guilty about taking sick days. I don't know why.  I actually have some GOOD news though. My ISP has sent me a little note that they're going to be doubling my download speed and increasing my upload speed by 4-5 times!!  All for   FREE   too!  My rating will soon be 3mbps down and 800kbps up.  Oh yea! There is a god :D

      Ok.. its been fun trying to get this to work. Apparently unless you're a Bell Sympatico member, you can't login via FTP to a sympatico member webspace. Who cares right? Yea well thats how Blogger works.  So at the moment I'm forced to upload it elsewhere and transfer manually from that external ftp to this space.  If anyone has any ideas how I can do this easily, it'd be much appreciated.

      Ok so I moved out a little over 30 days ago. Have the new house with Melissa and all is well. I have to say though, some of the neighbors around here lack brains.  For instance..  1) This is new development. Because of that, all our driveways are dirt. Our houses were built through the winter and in the last 2-3 weeks, the snow has melted and what happens to dirt driveway then? Soft mud right?  Ok, everyone seems to want to drive up their driveway and leave massively deep tread marks. If thats not bad enough, they don't take a few minutes to fill them in! I'm waiting until the a rather warm day when the mud hardens.. then they'll have a bitch of a time filling in those ruts.  2) The people across the street were thinking a bit more than a few of the others in #1 above. They decided they'd lay down something so that they can drive on it and wont make deep ruts. Smart right? You know what they layed down? FUCKING BLUE TARPS!! Seriously here folks. A Tarp. Took 2 of them the better part of 20 minutes too. I know because I was watching and laughing the whole time. So what happens when they finally finish and drive on it? They get deep ruts but the tarp is between the car and the dirt.  They seemed happy.  @_@  3) Just tonight, its snowing and miserable out..high winds, blah blah.  Anyways, I happen to look out a window out front of my house. Next door neighbors have left the trunk of their van WIDE OPEN! Who the hell knows how long but lights were off and they definately weren't coming back.  After about 5 minutes of laughing, Mel convinced me maybe we should tell them that their van interior was getting ruined. Yeah, maybe. :D

      My grandmother passed away on Wednesday of this week (the 14th) after a long fight with Sepsis (aka. blood infection). She'd been in the hospital since New Year's and seemed like she was getting "better" but took a turn for the worse the other day. I said "better" because the infection had caused her kidney's to shut down, among doing other damage, so even if she had recovered, her life would have been dramatically different from that point forward.  It was her decision to agree to exploratory surgery in an attempt to help her late Tuesday night. The doctor's said it was very possible nothing could be done and that she wouldn't recover from it, but she agreed anyway. She was a strong woman and too proud to let the infection defeat her so she took her chances. I'm sad but happy for her because ultimately, its better for her this way. My grandmother would have been the first to say that, and the whole family agrees.  However, all she originally went in for was foot surgery, so what I don't get is why do bad things happen to good people?  Visitation is today and her funeral is this Saturday.  I'm going to miss her.

      I need webcam drivers! I could go to Logitech's site but the damn drivers there are older than the ones I got from Windows Update months ago. I've formatted my computer and now the ones from Windows Update aren't there anymore! It's the suckiest thing that ever sucked!!!  Soooo... if anyone out there has a Logitech ClickSmart 510 webcam, and they managed to download and archive the drivers from Windows Update, please do contact me. I would very much like them!  Thanks!

      I finally managed to create the little splash page ( urlLink found here ) that I've wanted to do since the blog changed.  Also, if you notice up top, I added navigation links from the blog to the rest of the site.  Bonus!  I'm none too good at this webpage coding stuff so the fact that I managed to get all of this done makes me happy. The code might be sloppy but it works and thats all I care about. :)

      Damn was my car dirty. Living in a new subdivision doesn't help with dust and dirty flying all over the place (the ground doesn't have grass yet). It took me 5 hours on Saturday to clean it, inside and out. Thats with the help my dad too! Mind you we're pretty thorough but still.  Needless to say I have a mean burn on my face, neck and arms that hurts like a bitch. This sucks!

      First of all, the weather is crap.  So much for being outside washing cars and drinking beer in the sun.  So, as a second choice, I result to getting things done around the house.  Except that my original plans are larger than my actual ambition.  I'd say I couldn't care less about dusting an vacuuming and whatnot, but the truth is, it bugs me that it's not done, even though I don't feel like doing it at the moment.   And *someone* has brought a laptop home for the weekend and seems to have it glued to his knees.  I've hardly seen them separated since Friday afternoon - including bathroom time.   Not that I blame him.  I'd rather sit and relax and do something fun too.   Oh, well, there's one day left yet, so maybe there's some hope.

      I brought home a laptop from work to play with over the weekend. Its an IBM Thinkpad T41. Anyways, it has built in wireless due to the Centrino package. I turned it on once home and turns out that theres 2 wireless networks close by that aren't protected by a WEP key and are broadcasting their SSID. I'm actually connected to it right now. His SSID was still "Linksys" so I thought "Hey, I bet he hasn't even changed his router login/pass from the defaults either!"  Guess what? No he hasn't.  The unfortunate thing is that he probably doesn't even know that he has a security leak. If I was malicious, I could really wreck his crap. Lucky for him, I'm not. I intend to drop a word doc on one of his lan shares that informs him what he needs to do to protect his network...  .....but not until Sunday evening. ;)

      I wish I was more handy with HTML. I need to insert internal site links but the template code I scored from Blogger isn't very user friendly.  If I were to put links on this page, I was thinking of placing them in the space between the dark title cell up top and the white blog cells below. I'm not sure about it though..I'm guessing it'll look like crap.  So the alternative I'm thinking of is to change the redirect page to be a splash page. Nothing fancy. Just the same colour scheme, no graphics, the title and a bullet list (or something) of links that would take you to different areas of my piss poor mishmash I call a website.  I'm sure I can pull it off but the only problem is I doubt it will look good! Arghhhhhhh

      Because of the LAME requirement of Sympatico, only the user can upload to their ISP webspace.  This caused problems in the recent past as I was unable to have Blogger publish directly to my site via FTP. I used a workaround but it wasn't pretty. Long story short - the new comment feature wouldn't have dynamically updated until I manually updated the site. I didn't like that, so now I'm here. When you send your comment, it should show on the site immediately or within a few seconds.  I plan to link externally from here to my ISP webspace for various other things. I dunno. Silly_Walk has offered me webspace so I might just take it. We'll see how this goes first.

      New Blogger features! Notice the comments link below this post? Try it out! ;)  I've changed my template so the site is going to get a new look. So far the front page is the only thing affected and I'm not quite sure at this point if I want to add the other pages or not.  Go get a Blogger account now :)

      If anyone wants a  urlLink Google gmail account  then you should know that if you use Blogger, you're eligible to get a gmail account. After you sign in, you'll see an offer extended to you as a user of blogger. There's your in!  So anyways I have one. Its convex(at)gmail(dot)com   May as well sign up now. It's 1gb of space for fuck sake!

      This has got to be THE best Transformers remix ever! The video rocks too.   urlLink You must watch it!   If it crossed your mind that you might want to burn the music to a CD or something (and I really couldn't blame you!), I ripped the sound out and made it into a WMA file. If you want it,  urlLink grab it here .

      I can't seem to get rid of these things fast enough! Just yesterday I got rid of 3 invites and now today I log in and I have 5 more! I'm running out of people I know who are aware of what Gmail is and actually want an account.  So... I figure I'll put them up here as a bonus to anyone who reads my blog. The first 5 people to reply in the comments section to this post will get the invite.  PS. I receive email notification when a comment is submitted so please be patient because I'll be sending the invite along as soon as I can.

      Okay.. yesterday I mentioned I bought a logitech headset. DON'T GET THAT MODEL! They suck large donkeys for sound quality. Very flat and "tinny" sound. Poor base and midrange if at all.  I got a refund on those and bought a set by  urlLink Cyber Acoustics .  They're muuuuuuuuuch better!

      R.I.P. old headset. You serviced your time well.  How did it die? The cord was on the floor and Mel accidentically put the vacuum over it. The powerhead on it stripped the plastic coating on the cord and exposed the wire, breaking a few strands.  Ah well, accidents happen.   urlLink Here's my new Logitech headset.  Quite spiffy if I do say so myself. Works good!

      I haven't posted in a while but it just hasn't been high up on my to-do list. I'm going to try to get back in the habit again so we'll see how that goes.   Been busy playing some new games I bought:  urlLink Sacred  and  urlLink Battlefield 1942 . I know BF1942 is an older game but I've just really discovered it and finally see what all the noise was about. Sacred is a new game, much like Diablo 2, only better.   Tomorrow is my birthday, making me 26.&nbsp;Age doesn't really bother me but now I'm officially closer to 30 than 20. Scary..
