      So I headed off to the gym a little late this morning, so I don't think I should be bitching about other people being a lazy ass in the gym. But this is my blog, so I'm entitled to write whatever I want :-)  One good thing about Gold's Gym is that they have amble equipment. It is almost like you never need to be in line for anything no matter how many people there are. So I was going through my sets of bench press. In between my 2nd and my third set, this guy came over to me and start benching at my station while I stood close by. That just intrigues me. I mean there were probably 4-5 other benches close by with bars ready to go, yet this guys still have to use the one I was using. What is up with that? May be he likes the idea that the weights are all setup already and ready to go. Hell, it is just 2 25lbs-weights and not 20 45lbs-weights that Luis uses. Just grab 2 from a close by rack and slap them on to another station. You troubled yourself to come workout in the morning so that you can get off your lazy ass, but you are too lazy to setup your on weight. This is just one of the things that will never make sense to me.   Oh, one more thing. When he is finally done his only set, I have to wipe his disgusting sweat off my bench. I hate the feeling of other people's sweat.

      I have finally taken more initiative at work by requesting a home system. At last, I will be able to do some real work at home on a screen that is of a more reasonable size. I have been doing work from home on my laptop and it has not been productive at all. Hopefully, I can become more of a workaholic that Constance already claimed I am.   In addition to that I have also took my work desktop to the IT desk this afternoon to get it fixed. It has been hanging on me too frequently and I have decided to settle it once and for all. At least I hope this will be the case.   This further reinforced my belief that having a great IT support team is very important to the productivity of a company.

      I'm going to start collecting resources on the Internet about visual effects and imagery. I think these are some of the topics I find very interesting. I would love to pursue in finding out more in this field and get my hands dirty in some experiments. Here are some great resouses I have collected recently.    urlLink Paul Debevec   urlLink Henrik Wann Jensen   urlLink Advanced Graphics Algorithms   urlLink The Face Detector   urlLink Stanford's Digital Image Processing Course (EE368)   urlLink Using GPUs For General-Purpose Computing

      I'm pretty sure every Blog will have this first post message. I'm just going to go with the tradition :-) Let's just see how dedicated I can be to maintain an informative Blog for my family and friends. Wish me luck in my brave new adventure in the Great Blog World.
