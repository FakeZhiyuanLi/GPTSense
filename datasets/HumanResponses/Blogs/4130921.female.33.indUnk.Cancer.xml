       This thing isn't a real journal. If it were then I wouldn't be thinking so hard about it, editing myself. How do I feel today? A bit  disconnected . Perhaps, it is this book I am reading. It is glorious really, beautiful...it takes place in cyberspace. Vast, elusive, familiar, yet unknown. Constantly searching for a connection.  "Only the impossible is worth the effort."  Hmmmm, I don't know about that. Sounds good though doesn't it? It's a love story. One person is unattached, yet weary of falling in love. The other person is married, but growing apart from her spouse. They communicate via email, yet like lonely people do, they plan a meeting. Thinking it to be only about attraction and sex and promising themselves not to   feel   anything, of course they fall in love. From sweet memory(once night of passion in Paris) to possibility (following a planned yet chance encounter).  Possibility ...that's a killer concept isn't it? Dreamers know what I mean. Here's my question. When is it time to let go of dreams and possibilities? Here I am navigating and compromising my way through life, having given up on lots of things, but constantly second guessing myself...am I making the right decision here? Am I pussying out or being brave? Do I fucking sell out?  How   How  How do I not utterly sell out? For now the voice in my head wins...you know who you are...she says,  "More will be revealed."

       Adrienne Rich said that  anger  can be a kind of genius if it's acted on. Audre Lourde said that there are several uses for anger.  So I guess I must learn to do something with mine . Yet most people seem to get so upset...they are quesy, uneasy, unnerved, and anxious. Mine are just words after all...an honest outburst or a volatile reaction. I'm simply expressing myself and loving others who do the same. Those who know me know I'm full of hot air...and they laugh and adore me all the more. We had a good giggle tonight, didn't we D? Everyone else can just go about their boring business and sleep walk themselves to death...just stay out of my way and keep your needles to yourselves.

       urlLink      I am  Enid . Not so much anymore...I think I am nicer and more grounded now. It is a strange thing to watch a movie and feel like the writer was inside of your head. I imagine Enid's struggles after her bus ride into nowhere to be intense, but if she just  perseveres  she'll get her happy ending...I just know it.

       There is this fantastic scene in the film  Amadeus  where Mozart's foe (ironically I cannot remember his name) curses God for giving him the ear to appreciate and adore Mozart's music, while withholding in him the gift to create such beauty himself. It is this light that I attempt to write. I cannot stand my own writing. I am not talented and all attempts to string together beauty in the form of words fail miserably. However, I am an idea person. I have the gift for analysis and deconstruction (which seems to be inexhaustible). In other words, I must write. I must express these wretched ideas in order to calm my brain, to quiet the noise, and to amuse myself.  Enough for today. This is getting old.

       urlLink      Bored ... Curious ... Narcissistic ...All the reasons for this creation. I really have no idea what I'm doing. Be kind, I am slow to join the 21st century.
