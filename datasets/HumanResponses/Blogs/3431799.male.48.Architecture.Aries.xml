						   Jacob is back from a week at boy scout camp.  He was down at camp Durant, down by Carthage, NC.  This week he is off to Lacrosse Camp during the weekday mornings.  He received all the gear he needed to play competitively for his birthday, so we expect he will try to play for Smith Middle school this coming year.  Kelly is down in Fayetteville with the cousins and Michael is home working with me.  Nancy is hard at work at Duke this week also.

						   About the 16th of June we had Nancy's aunt and uncle (Hal and Shirley Metz), now from sunset beach, NC, come visit.  Not a week later my aunt and uncle from Churchland, Va (Sam and Blanche Bisese) came for a night.  The following Sunday (6/26) my aunt from Hawaii (Arlene Schwab, my mother's sister)came down for a night.  She apparently came back to Virginia for a high school reunion, then on to Roanoke, Va and then down here to Chapel Hill, NC.  She had a friend from Hawaii who had relocated in the area down in Pittsboro, NC, about a 15 minute drive south of Chapel Hill.  So now we prepare for the 4th of July!  Nancy and the kids will be at Harker's Island for the week of the 4th for a summer vacation.  OH YEA........as of July 1, 2004 the HOKIES are in the ACC!  Miracles do happen, Hell has frozen over.  I am only sorry my Dad didn't get to see this!  Leo Barber class of 1961, Tim & Nancy Barber class of 1979.  We are sorry to announce that Nancy does have a Wahoo in the family!
