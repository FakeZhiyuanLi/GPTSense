      01-13-98 --Rochester, NY---  * The President, and the left in general, have been chanting the mantra that we should drop the President's trial, and (all together now) "get on with the nation's business". Well, pardon me, but isn't the removal of a shamelessly corrupt   President the nation's business, and in the direct interest of the nation? What is their motivation for missing this crucial point?  * Does it strike anyone as odd that Larry Flynt, publisher of 'Hustler', and (former?) sex kitten Madonna, slime ball Alan Dershowitz, and the world's worst excuse for a news person, Geraldo Rivera, and Presidentially hired thug, James Carville should be acting as President Clinton's moral defenders against the Republicans, and most of the Democrats? Given their individual and collective history, how can anyone claim that these hold any moral high ground? How do Clinton's other defenders deal with being lumped with them? Can it be that like those listed here, they simply don't care about such matters as honor, and country? What is their motivation?  * How is it that when Congressional Republicans all vote for something, it's partisan politics, but when the Congressional Democrats do the same thing, it's "A Bi-partisan effort, in the best interests of the nation"? What is their motivation for passing a so seriously flawed logic off as truth to the American public?  * How is it that while Democrats are trumpeting the Rodino hearings from the Nixon impeachment as 'fair', they seem to forget that Rodino was canned for his overt partisanship? What is their motivation for this oversight?   * So, if Hillary is a strong woman, why is she still hanging onto Bill's coat tails, even after all this slime has pulled? All the women I know, even the ones not particularly strong, I know would have left a welt on Clinton's jaw, a swinging door, and a dust trail. Can it be she has other motivations for sticking by this guy?  * Speaking of strong women, did anyone in the press make note that in the last election, we  had a double digit swing toward the Republicans among women voters? Can it be that they had some motivation for ignoring this pertinent fact?  * For all the screaming from the Democrats about how much this bit with Clinton has cost us, has ONE come forward and stated that it's Clinton's doing? That had he told the truth, the whole thing could have been over with a couple of phone calls and a late nighter or two? Is there some motivation for ignoring this fact?  * Why are the Democrats worried about calling witnesses in the impeachment trial of Mr Clinton? If, as they suggest, all we'll hear is testimony we've heard before, and if, as they suggest, the testimony so far does not give evidence of impeachable offenses, then the Democrats should have nothing to fear by hearing it all again. Indeed, if what they say is true; that witnesses won't do anything to damage Clinton's case, it can only serve to hurt the case of those removing Mr Clinton. Yet, we see these objections from the Democrats... who are going to great lengths to prevent witnesses from giving direct, live testimony. It appears that the Democrats figure the chances of damaging Mr Clinton's case to be higher than the Republicans damaging theirs. It would appear that they don't trust Mr. Clinton not to be hiding further shockers from them, that could be sprung on them. In short the Democrats fear the truth. Yet, even though they don't trust him, they're willing, for partisan reasons, to continue to inflict him on the American people. The motivation here seems fairly clear...    The Democrats know full well that if they lose this one, it's over. They're finished as a party. They're both so far in debt that they can't do much to sell their story to anyone ( or buy off potential witnesses) ... and so lacking in credibility that they can't raise any more money, either (unless China is willing to help. FBI, are you watching?)   Clinton's defenders look like and act like, drowning rats. You've not seen such a thing, I expect. A group of drowning rats is a terrible thing to behold, and in this case is also instructive on what we're seeing going on at the DNC and among the Democrats in the Congress. They even try to climb on the back of their drowning fellow rats in an effort to save themselves, and fight and bite others who have an advantage on them in the fight to survive.   So, then, are the Democrats at this stage of the trial. They're busy trying everything they can... even killing off some of their own, to save their sorry backsides.  That's their motivation.  Do we really need to let them take the country down with them?

      02-21-99 --Rochester, NY---    A while ago, I raised a question that had been bothering me for some time:  "* So, if Hillary is a strong woman, why is she still hanging onto Bill's coat tails, even after all this slime has pulled? All the women I know, even the ones not particularly strong, would have left a welt on Clinton's jaw, a swinging door, and a dust trail. Can it be she has other motivations for sticking by this guy? "  "Questions of Motivation" -1-13-99  Well, if the current Washington chatter is correct, we now know why, and just what her motivation is, in two words: Senator Hillary. Assuming, that is, that you trust the press. Of course, I do not. Let's first for the sake of discussion, assume that what we're hearing is true. If it is, it seems fairly easy to defeat a Hillary Clinton Senatorial candidacy by simply pointing out that this has to be the only reason that she stuck with Bill; Power of her own. Think back; She's made it clear over the years that she thinks  of herself as a kind of Co-President (the Constitution and the will of the people, and the lack of an election not withstanding) , and certainly went to great effort to make use of that crown in the little medical care fiefdom she set up for herself. She has always coveted governmental power for her own ends, and has shown this at every opportunity. It's obvious to even the most casual observer  that Hillary leaving Bill over Monica and the rest, would have removed any chance at Hillary obtaining power of a more legitimate sort for herself.  The facts suggest that she simply decided to bide her time, and use her position relative to the President's, to obtain power of her own.  If this story out of Washington is true, then this is the picture that is presented to the American people. A scheming woman, willing to parley her Husband's elections into power for herself.... something he'd never have been able to obtain on her own. And she's willing to deal with all of the bimbo eruptions to get there. Does this sound elect able to you? I'm willing to bet that it doesn't sound that way even to the majority of Democrats.  Oh, don't misunderstand; I don't doubt that there are those Democrats who take this whole thing very seriously and consider the Clintons to be the best thing that's happened to America since Karl Marx. But I'm not convinced this accounts for the majority of Democrats. Moreover, I'm not sure the Clintons do, either. This is particularly true of the district she proposes to take over; that of retiring Senator Daniel Patrick Moynahan, whose positions, (and whose district) generally are far to the right of the Clintons, and even of mainstream Democrats, as to make the prospect of Hillary moving into such a position laughable, if it were not so dangerous for Freedom in America.  (Granted that being to the left of Hillary and mainstream Democrats would be hard to do; there's not much room to their left.)  Which brings us to the more likely possibility that the whole thing ISN'T true... (Since when have the Clintons EVER employed the truth?) Well, for what purpose could this idea have been pushed by the press? Consider the timing of this little escapade. The Democrats, and particularly the White House, desperate to move the onus off of Bill being a sexual predator, and a felon, needed something to shift the focus, off of both the trial and the new events; The Dolly Kyle-Browning lawsuit, and the Broderick Rape, and subsequent White House inspired killing of the story by NBC... What better way to do so, than to create a controversy such as this?  And the thing is, to a large degree, the ruse seems to be working. At least, that is, if you trust the press.   And, as I say, I do not.

      03-08-99 --Rochester, NY---  Watching the derisive reaction of Democrats to Juanita Broderick, I'm reminded of their quite different reaction to Anita Hill, the accuser of Justice Clarence Thomas.  Anita Hill, you will recall, was the subject of leftist breast beating  (pardon the pun) over sexual harassment in the workplace. This objection of Hill's was you may recall, around a decade old the time it finally made public light. Rightists still charge today... and many leftists agree... it was only brought up as a roadblock (however unsuccessful) to the Clarence Thomas nomination to the United States Supreme Court.  At the time, we were told by the left that no matter how old such charges were, we should take them seriously because to do otherwise would mean we don't take sexual harassment seriously. We were also reminded that there are several cases of sexual harassment and attack that go unreported for many years, because the victim simply cannot deal with it before then.   The argument of the left was strikingly similar in the case of the lion's share of the 18 charges of sexual misconduct against Sen. Bob Packwood. In that case, the alleged incidents occurred more than 10 years earlier and four of them more than 20 years earlier. We were to take those charges seriously, too... and we did, removing Packwood from office for his offenses. NOW still prides itself on being on the leading edge of the lynch mob who attacked Thomas, and Packwood. Ironically, it was Packwood who was the biggest single Congressional backer, Republican, or Democrat, of Women's rights issues.   Yet, now, with Juanita Broderick's charges against Mr. Clinton, (and, for that matter the Jones, Willey, and the mirad of other charges as well) the left suddenly forgets the principles it fought so hard for in the Thomas and Packwood cases. Indeed, the defense of Clinton is as energetic as the persecution of Thomas and Packwood.... despite the similarity of the nature of charges and the evidence backing them.  Remember the "I believe Anita" buttons proudly worn by liberal opponents of Clarence Thomas in '91? We're now starting to see "I believe Juanita" bumper stickers. The trend is not without merit; Juanita Broderick is far more compelling, credible, and convincing, than was Hill back in 1991, particularly in light of the many others lining up to lay charges against Clinton, and what we now know of the man and his behavior. Consider, too, the fact that Hill was alone in standing against Thomas, and that there was no pattern of behavior that would have supported her charges. On the other hand, Clinton himself has provided us all with ample evidence to support any claims of sexual harassment.. again, based on past behavioral patterns.   It's interesting to note that the kind of evidence that Thomas's opponents considered crucial to the dignity of mankind in general, and womanhood in particular, is dismissed out of hand by Clinton defenders. Even before Lanny Davis heard Juanita Broderick tell her story, he was busy dismissing it. "How do we know she didn't lie to all of her friends?"  (Can you imagine the reaction to a Republican making such a remark?)  Even Hill herself...(at least when surrounded by "friends" from NOW) suggests she trusts Bill Clinton. This from the woman who helped to define sexual harassment charges back in 1992, despite the marked similarity of the charges.   I'm forced by this dichotomy to wonder what is the motivation for each  stance. If the left's reaction to Hill can be labeled by them as 'principled and reasoned', what happens to those principles when  a liberal is the subject of the investigation? This is a key question to determining the motivation of the left. After all, if one is driven by principle, one will, given the same set of conditions, react the same way each time.   In light of this, then, perhaps we should consider what can be considered consistent in their acts. There is but one consistency; each action defended a leftist.  Mind you, that does not suggest that the defense is reserved for those who hold with the positions taken on this subject or that... say, Women's rights for example.... else Bob Packwood would still be in office to this day.... but rather avowed liberals... such as Bill Clinton.   There is, then, only one conclusion as to the motivation behind their actions; Lockstep Liberal office holders at all costs.   And principle has nothing whatsoever to do with it.

      The pattern is well established.   Politicians and others have frequently blamed "hatred" for headline-making crimes, particularly when in the act of pandering to so-called Minority groups..  *After the April 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City, President Clinton named G. Gordon Liddy among the  conservative talk-show hosts he called "purveyors of hatred and division," saying they were "encouraging violence." The press liberal press, who has long been willing to prostitute itself to the end of cefeating anyone who holds views to the right of say, Fidel Castro, gleefully agreed with him.  There was serious talk of McVeigh being charged under "Hate crimes' laws, but I've forgotten if he ever was procecuted under those laws.I suspect it was.  *Concerned over arson attacks on black churches in 1996, (You recall, the ones Mr Clinton lied about) civil rights leader Joseph Lowery accused the Christian Coalition of fostering an "extremist climate." The non-problem was followed up as a group of hate crimes.  *When avowed homosexual Matthew  Sheppard was killed in Wyoming last year, Gay-rights advocate Joan M. Garry suggested it was the result of a conservative anti-homosexuality campaign she said "fuels the fires of bigotry.", and his killers were subject to Hate Crime statutes.   *Following the shootings last month at a Jewish community center in California, the leftist media and politicians jumped onto the hate crime bandwagon, labeling those episodes of violence "hate crimes".  Yet there is another pattern, also well  established… a more disturbing one.  #When a gunman spouting blasphemous rhetoric burst into a youth service at a Fort Worth Baptist church this week, and fatally shot seven persons, the government's war on Guns was nowhere to be seen. No charges of 'hate crime' here.  #When in 1997, a kid who had been known as anti-Christian shot up a high school prayer group in Paducah, KY where were the people protecting the citizenry  from 'hate crime'?  #When the April murders of Christian  students at Columbine High School in Colorado, made the front page… where the shooters specifically picked out Christians to shoot at by asking them for professions of faith and then killing them for their answer, we saw no calls from the usual suspects about 'hate crime' status.  Such is life in America today.  The obvious question is why such double standards are allowed to exist. The answer, I fear, goes directly to the heart of the reason behind the hate crime laws.  What are those reasons?  Well, it doesn't pass my notice that there are many who scream loudly to the populace for hate crimes laws when certain groups… groups whom they have  historically favored…  are targeted. Yet, these same people keep stony silence when other groups that they don't favor are. This  (along with the apparently selective implementation of hate crime laws themselves) sends the message that hate itself isn't the issue… but, rather WHOM you hate. And of course, by passing hate crimes laws and selectively implementing them, the government sends the clear message of whom we shall and shall not hate.     A look around provides the idea that hostility to Christians, and others who hold traditional American values, is growing rapidly, and government is doing much to foster this hostility, mostly under the guise of 'fairness'. The message being sent by our government is that the only people capable of hate are those who dare to try and uphold traditional cultural values, and/or those who are  Christian.  It is clear; prosecution of crimes Anti-Christian bias as a crime motive is routinely ignored by the news media, and by  Government. What is equally clear, if we take the time to look, is the reason behind it. Namely, government and the liberals in the press care more about protecting some people more than others. This is fair?  I suggest that this double standard is just one more front on the culture war … a war so many deny exists. Yet, it is a war that  continues to claim victims. As in this case.  Let me be clear, here. I am not suggesting that we give 'hate crimes' status to those crimes which do not yet have such status. I'm suggesting that we should grant 'hate crime' status to NO crime.  By their design, and certainly by their implementation, the Hate Crimes statutes tend to reveal motives on the part of the government, which have racial and cultural motives, which are directed against the majority.  Lincoln once observed that a house divided against itself cannot stand. Hate Crimes laws, far from being the healing tool they were supposed to be, have only served to deepen our division. It's time to remove them from the books.

      09-30-01 22:14Hrs--Rochester, NY---  It is little discussed in the press, and less understood in the general public, that the kind of terrorism brought upon these shores on September 11th, is more or less a daily event in Israel, and has been so since 1948 .One would think that our country's leadership would grasp that linkage more clearly after being pummeled by it for so long.  Alas, that they seem more interested in listening to the pacifists in this country and the world, rattling on and on about how we should examining the 'root causes' of the recent violence against the US?. That we should understand, as one pundit put it, the "alienation" and "sense of grievance" against us by various people in the Middle East.  Reality counsels us that it was exactly this kind of non-thinking, this seeking the "root causes of crime" during the 60's here in the US, which created our overly soft policies toward crime, and which, thereby, led to the truly grotesque crime rates of today. So, now, we're to find the 'root causes' of someone's desire to level two buildings full of 10,000 innocents? Perhaps the desire here is to induce more of this kind of behavior as our 'soft on crime' fellows of the 1960's so generously provided us? Ironic, too, that the two suggestions are from the same sources.  Let's be realistic.  Those who attacked us on September 11th, and their fellow terrorists are of a particular mindset. (I call them terrorists. To call the attackers Arabs, insults the majority of Arabs and the majority of Muslims,, and I won't do it here) These terrorists will not be appeased by anything less than the annihilation of the west. They have demonstrated this desire for this destruction, and their ability to provide it, time and again, for decades.  It's not like the West, mostly the US, hasn't tried. Every chance for peace has been provided, every consideration shown and every forbearance provided, even after it was demonstrated many times that such chances were unwarranted, and not in the best interests of peace in the region, and the world.  Doctor Thomas Sowell echoes my comparison  between our bumbling with the Middle east, to the west's pre-WWII stance, vis'a vie Neville Chamberlain:  "Chamberlain sought to "remove the causes of strife or war." He wanted "a general settlement of the grievances of the world without war." In other words, the British Prime Minister approached Hitler with the attitude of someone negotiating a labor contract, where each side gives a little and everything gets worked out in the end. What Chamberlain did not understand was that all his concessions simply led to new demands from Hitler -- and contempt for him by Hitler. What Winston Churchill understood at the time, and Chamberlain did not, was that Hitler was driven by what Churchill called "currents of hatred so intense as to sear the souls of those who swim upon them." That was also what drove the men who drove the planes into the World Trade Center."   Dr. Sowell is, of course, quite correct. More often than not, peace is simply not within reach at the peace table.  There are, however, other noteworthy similarities, too, between this and the pre-WWII era? For example, take the anti-Semitism of both Hitler, and Bin Laden's people. It is this same hatred as Sowell mentions, that causes suicide bombers to blow up Israeli teen-agers at a disco or Israeli families at a Jeruselem Sbarro pizzeria, along with themselves. And... Oh, my!... it's the same group of people, that flew those planes on the 11th. Do you suppose anyone in Washington has made this link, yet?  Yes, we saw some Arab countries and cultures express remorse at the loss of life, but NOT at the TACTICS. Some goodness, some morality is struggling to get out, over there. However, it would appear that the morality suffers under the weight of what passes for political reality in the Arab world today. Take Iran for example, who at first, following the attack, made statements that seemed to be very friendly indeed, and then only later made statements denouncing the 'disgusting' Americans, and arrested it's own people for partaking in candlelight vigils in respect to our dead in New York and Washington. Clearly, these delayed anti-western responses, are reactions to political pressure within the Arab block. So it was that after the attack on America, we got all these expressions of support, but no denunciation from the Arab world, of the terrorists themselves, and what they were about.  Consider, too, that there were no Arab voices raised in condemnation when suicide bombers blew up Israeli teen-agers at that disco full of kids, and Israeli families at that  Jeruselem Sbarro pizzeria. Indeed, the mass-murderers were called martyrs to the cause. At the moment, that same phrasing is being used by some Arabs to describe the lothesome bastards who killed over 6500 Americans last month.  So, how is it that our leaders here in the west apparently haven't figured out what's what? The problem is that they, too are bowing to political pressure. The problem is the pervasive humanistic view, fed to us in the 60's and reinforced hence by the country's left wing, that there is good in all people, and all we have to do is placate them long enough to find it. Or, as I put it a few months ago, the belief that sacrifice and bloodshed will not be necessary; and that peace and prosperity are the universal goals of mankind. I hope and trust Mr. Bush is not among those swayed by this claptrap, as Chamberlain, and Clinton were., and as the rabid left here in the US continues to be.  As an aside: Such nonsense is clearly the view of Jesse Jackson, whose efforts to act as a 'bridge' are raising questions. "...there must be some bridge, even a civilian bridge.", notes Jackson. Ummm... A bridge between what, Jesse? Between the Americans and the Taliban? Does this mean you are not American? The subject of Mr Jackson's motivations in this matter is a lengthy one and perhaps worthy of a column to itself. Perhaps I'll tackle that one next week.   Anyway, alas that peace and prosperity for all is not a universal goal. The reason is simple: There are some people in the world that are simply evil.  Our own prisons are filled with such people.Oh, I know it's not politically correct to call people who are in jail, 'evil'. Well, face facts, people... some of them are. Indeed, most.  That established, Is it really so much of a shock that we would find such players on the world stage, playing for larger stakes, such as a Hitler, or a Bin Laden? And isn't it ironic that the very leftists who were quick to call Timothy McVeigh, 'evil' after the attack on OKC's Murrah, are the same folks who are telling us we need to look at the 'root causes' of the attack on the world trade center? Why is it they did not look for the the "alienation" and "sense of grievance" in McVeigh and yet are willing to do so for BinLaden? If simply calling something evil and dealing with it as such is good domestic terrorism policy, why is it less sound in international terrorism policy? On the surface, it would seem something else is influencing the judgementt. of the left here in the states.  All one can hope is that the influence of these people remains as low as it's been in the last few days. To that end,  we  need to ask ourselves: How many more people in the west are going to have to die before we learn the lesson of the double standard, and deal with these war criminals, and their supporters, as such?

      10/13/02 --Rochester, NY---  In watching the "debate" over attacking Saddam Hussien, there is one point that the detractors seemingly keep failing to mention... This man and his supporters are driven to destroy both the people and the culture of these United States.  I wonder, frankly why they would do that. Let’s examine the reasons.  I have stated several times in this column that I hold politics a means to a societal end... Whatever that end might be for the individual or group.  On that basis, one would normally argue that the societal end of any American citizen should at least include, if it doesn't focus directly on, the furtherance of western culture in general, and American culture particularly. Well, common sense would dictate that at least.  If we make the assumption that most follow that rule,  we can make three observations very quickly about those those arguing against our waging war against those who have declared war against us, and have acted on that declaration .  The kindest observation would be that the people in question seriously under-estimate the danger presented to the stated goal of supporting and extending the sway of western culture. In short, To hell with the country, and for that matter, the rest of the world ... So long as their short - term political goals are satisfied.  Since, as I say, this is the kindest cut, it only gets downhill from here, I’m afraid.  The second, less kind observation would of course be that they are operating outside the group of people who are for the furtherance of our culture, and so they simply don't care about it. Apparently, there are many libertarians who are in this position. I find their position singular in it’s short- sightedness. Since they are in the extreme minority, I won’t delve very far into this one, except to suggest that this is the major flaw in the stated libertarian philosophy; they think government should have no influence on culture…. Forgetting, apparently, that the original purpose of government was to reinforce and extend it.  The third, most damning, and possibly most accurate observation would be that the people against our defending ourselves are working directly against us and directly for the destruction of our culture our society and our way of life. There are many, I fear, who are quite squarely in this last group. The majority of them are Democrats.  Now, lest you think this an outlandish statement, consider the new book by one Yossef Bodansky called "The High Cost of Peace", which I’ve only had a chance to go over quickly as this is written.  At first glance, this book will be worth picking up.   Bodansky, in his book reports that former President Bill Clinton betrayed pro-American Syrians who sought to oust the reviled, terroristic, drug-dealing Assad regime.  Catch this act: Bodansky goes on to suggest that dozens of Sunni officers in mid-1999 wanted to overthrow Assad and bring Damascus into the modern world with economic development and a representative government. They asked the U.S. for help. So, the U.S. Embassy responded by requesting a list of the coup leaders and details of the plan. "Naively, the Syrians complied," Bodansky writes. Then "the Clinton administration decided to save Assad."  It released the names of the leaders of this pro-American coup to Assad, which resulted in a deadly purge.   "Washington betrayed an intended coup that was supposed to be pro-American against a regime that was on the United States' own terrorism and drug-trafficking lists," the author summarizes.   And Americans wonder why those in the Middle East hate us?  I would take that a step farther;  9/11 would not have happened, had another pro-American power been in place in Damascus.   And let's see what we can of those the Clinton administration befreinded.... Yassir Arifat. Reports are that he tried to assasinate Colin Powell and the Israeli president, as well, as they were on their way to a peace conference. I've written quite a bit about Terrorfat, so I won't go much further here, either.  Given these reports,  much less including the other discussions we’ve had on the subject over the recent years, I’m quickly coming to the conclusion that the Democrats, of whom Bill Clinton is only a part, are intent on the willful destruction of America.  I think you are, too.   But it gets even more conclusive.  We’re now seeing reports that there is a direct link between Robert Jaquez and Saddam Husein.   Now we find out that the government at the time… Read that Bill Clinton’s White House, and many lower level people within the FBI and the CIA have been stuffing the information that there’s a link.  http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/news/opinion/4251116.htm  Now, remember; this is a bombing Clinton tried to blame on the voices of the right. If this report is anywhere near accurate, it becomes clear that Murrah’s terrorism was the left was doing it’s work, And as usual blaming the right.  So we arrive back at the question of why liberals would defend Saddam, with this new information about Clinton's activities in the MiddleEeast, with only one answer. There is no other logical conclusion, but that the left is working toward the destruction of America.. Just look at the stink they raise about anything that even comes close to resembling America defending itself and it’s interests.  It was Robert Frost who suggested that liberals are so open minded they won’t even take their own side in an argument. However, in this case with all respect to the talented Mr. Frost, I tend to doubt its open-mindedness that causes them to take the positions they do. Rather, with the evidence presented us, it’s clear that Liberal Democrats are actually representing their own position; That is to say, they’re being what they are. Anti-American.  That's right... you read it correctly, that's what I said. And I mean it; Liberal Democrats have exposed themselves as being Anti-American.  Remember that, come Election Day.

      01/20/03 --Rochester, NY---  The left is a group of fighters, with an agenda… and a group in search of an excuse to impose that agenda, as a solution to whatever problem happens to be to hand at the moment. Even if they created the problem in the first place.  Back in the early 90's when the SUV started becoming the vehicle of choice for millions of Americans, the left was had problems justifying their arguments against such vehicles. Having higher priorities at that time, (such as defending Bill Clinton from his misdeeds), the attentions of the left were turned away from this.   Nowadays, the left has no such distractions, and there has been some serious concentration on an all-out campaign against the SUV. But let's examine in critical fashion, the arguments the left puts up against the SUV, shall we?  First, let's take the most recent one, being pushed the loudest by the ‘Detroit Project":   >SUV's support terrorists  While this would be true if we were actually getting a significant portion of our oil from the Middle East, we're not. Iraq, for example, only accounts for around 9% of our consumption, under the normal conditions we've not had for some 10 years now.  Also, let's consider that the head of 'People for the American Way', Norman Lear who is the creator of these ads has a garage with 21 cars that includes 2 Limousines Private Jet.  Forgive me, Norman, but somehow, I doubt your sincerity on this issue. In fact, Lear is not alone. According to actual survey, over half of the people involved in this political hit movement drive SUV's.  Let's also consider the idea that all automobiles burn fuel, and often at as high a rate as SUV's, the whining not withstanding. Looking even closer, let's say that the SUV uses 20 gal per week, on average. Meanwhile the driver of the average car gets a little better, burning perhaps 8 gallons per week less. Are the folks at the Detroit project telling us that it's just the money for that eight gallons that funds terrorism, and the rest are OK?  So, by those lights, shouldn't that be ANYTHING that burns gas or uses oil contributes? Why just SUV's?   Should we be shutting down NASCAR and NHRA competitions because they're anti-American? Do we all become Amish to satisfy these people? The question becomes, of course, at what point does this Liber-Lie™  get to absurd levels?  ( I will quietly offer, yet again, the writings of late last summer, as regards all of this: http://home.rochester.rr.com/bitheads/realenemy.html )   >SUV's Pollute   Again, comes the question about ALL autos. The fact is, the polution from such vehicles are no worse than the vast majority on the road today, Including the mini-coffins the left would have us driving.   >There's no real need for the SUV   I'm forced to agree with Charles Galbach, who speaks to these points better than I:     "In the first place, the purchase of SUV's by businesses was the result of your close buddies, the tax lawyers and their cohorts in the not that long ago Democratically controlled congress which permitted or encouraged a windfall tax deduction for SUV's, posing as "trucks". Since the Republicans have a history of trying to bottle up lawyers, including tax lawyers, where they belong and also have a history of opposing business taxes rather than the Democrat method of manufacturing loopholes, it had to be the Democrats who conjured up this ruse. It obviously backfired with unintended consequences.  Secondly, it was the Democrats who forced the auto industry into creating vehicles that couldn't hold even 2 adults and 2 children without them being squashed inside a thimble sized vehicle. These same vehicles are underpowered and therefore unsafe on any highway at any speed. They qualify for no more than zipping around an area no bigger than your typical gated community – a role better served by the usual golf cart.  Everyone, except the rabid few enviro-whackos can see this. As a result, we see mom driving around in an oversized vehicle which is the only one that can hold her kids and a couple friends on a trip to soccer practice – or grandma driving around in an oversized vehicle which is about the only thing safe enough for her to drive on her daily errands."  To this excellent commentary, I would add one more point: Like millions of Americans, I tow frequently enough to make a truck an economical choice.  Now, I happen to do this with a conversion van, which you can see in the above linked BIT.  But I could easily do this with an SUV, as well, and many do.  Cars have been so downsized that towing with anything less is simply unsafe if not impossible. As an example, I will never forget the sight a few years ago while in Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, the sight of an obviously honeymooning couple using a Dodge Neon to tow a fairly small sized popup camper. We were at a parking spot along the ocean, near a popular eating spot.  There's a sizeable hill out front. When he pulled in, I could smell his brakes burning, from trying to get down the hill without smacking something or someone.  They ate, and left. Well, they tried to…. They got stuck going back up that same hill… the car had all it could do to hold the trailer against the hill… and the trailer only weighed a couple thousand lbs.!  You do NOT want people and equipment like this next to you on the highway. But just think of all the gas he's saving, right up to the part where they both die horribly because he can't control the thing.  If milage is the desired goal, fine, go after it. Meantime, leave me something that actually works. Create something that can tow 6000lbs, without getting into trouble, is safe in an accident sitaution, and yet gets 45mpg, and is at a reasonable initial cost, and is as dependable as our current modes of transport,  and I'll buy it. Meantime, leave me the beep alone.  Which leads me, finally, to a personal comment, to those of you who think small cars are "safe".  I hesitate to say this. Twice now, I've been at the scene of an accident… once where I knew the victims personally, and once where I happened upon an accident before the police arrived. Both fatal accdents, both one car accdients, and both situations where the person would have lived had they had something better than a Ford Fiesta in one case, or a Prius, in the other.  In both cases, they valued a gallon of gas over their own lives, and paid the price…. And I'm left with the horrible memory of those two incidents.  I will *never* drive such a vehicle, and I don't give a hot crap WHAT kind of gas numbers it turns in.   >SUV's Aren't safe in accdients, having higher accident death rates.  NHTSA figures report that 64% of SUV deaths are blamed on lack of seatbelts, not of vehicle design. And of those, a sizeable number are related to tire failures, which in turn are caused by lack of tire maintainance... simply keeping the tires up to pressure, and THAT in fairly isolated cases. When those incidents are factored out, the death rates in SUV's are actually LOWER than for the kind of tincans the left would have us in.  Now, of course comes the story from several difference sources (NewsMax, The NY POST, etc) that the people behind this are the rich Hollywood left, led by Norman Lear, who himself owns a 21 car garage. Excuse me, but I question the sincerity of this arguments' proponants.  Sorry, but from any angle... ANY angle...this anti-SUV argument doesn't hold up. Since all these arguments are so easily defeated, it strikes me taht what we're seeing is more a poliytical ploy, than anything else. An excuse for a bigger attack. An infamous socialist (is there any other kind) Adolf Hitler, had the Jews as an excuse for his attacks. The socialists of today have the SUV as their excuse. I refuse to be a victim as they were, for the purpose of someone's political ploy for power.  You should refuse to, as well.

      2-12-01 10:20Hrs--Rochester, NY---  As most of you know, I have a newswire here, which is updated for me, live, 24/7. It is where I get a goodly dose of news myself. You can, too, at  http://home.rochester.rr.com/bitheads/newsroom.html    Since it updates fairly frequently, this story is likely not in there any longer. Here's the link to it, but I'll save you the trouble. http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63701-2002Feb12.html  Mr. Turner, speaking before a group of students at the school he was tossed out of several years ago, Brown University, was there giving a lecture on international affairs. I'll bite my tongue on that one for the moment. Turner said, in part:  "The reason that the World Trade Center got hit is because there are a lot of people living in abject poverty out there who don't have any hope for a better life,"  It's a tremendously "feel good" kind of nothing that many liberals, and many people in the EU I've spoken with, have been tossing out of late. The basic idea is we here in America are taking all the wealth and all the resources. So, the poor of the world attack us, as a result. We're supposed to feel guilty for being Americans, and guilty for being successful, because the old zero sum game suggests that because we're successful, no other countries can be so.   Well, let's examine this idea. If you want to speak of abject poverty, shall we discuss the depression, here in America? 30-50% of people out of work? Hmmm. I don't seem to recall many innocents being targeted for wholesale slaughter in that period.  It should be noted that Mr. Turner is a multi-millionaire. It should also be noted that the person who paid for the attacks on 9/11, is (or was) a multi-millionaire. Clearly, another factor is at work, and Mr. Turner's argument is tossed on its face.  OK, I'll grant you, Ted Turner is a nutcase....a point even Hanoi Jane figured out. But he's hardly unique in the ranks of the elitist left. Consider Al Gore, in an AP story:        "In his first policy address since the 2000 election, Gore renewed his support for the Bush administration's ``highly successful opening counterattack'' to the attacks. But he said it is crucial that the administration show ``a more evident respect'' for the coalition of allies it has built or that alliance could quickly crumble. Gore said the administration sometimes sends the message: ``With others, if we must; by ourselves, if possible.''      As if there's something wrong with that, huh? The story goes on:     "Gore said U.S. policy should also be aimed long-range at ``draining the aquifer of anger that underlies terrorism.'' ``The evil we now confront is not just the one-time creation of a charismatic leader and his co-conspirators, or even a handful of regimes,'' Gore said. ``What we deal with now is today's manifestation of an anger welling up from deep layers of grievance shared by many millions of people.''       Of course, Mr. Gore is saying, it's our fault that these people are angry. Of course they're angry at us for being Americans, being successful. Fortunate for us, The "Blame America First" message was disastrous to the 80s Democrats and is no more effective today, than it was back then, else Gore would be president.   Let's face it, folks; the cause for the attack on 9/11 is the existence of evil, and the Clinton administration's allowance for it, in terms of decimating our intelligence gathering and national security as well as bargaining with a known terrorist.  The lack of focus we see today on the part of the Democrats, seems on the surface to be a blessing to America; their true natures tend to come out when they are less well orchestrated. This anti-Americanism is the heart of Liberalism, and their true natures are showing... just in time... on the leading edge of the election season. The republicans would do well to remind the America people where the hearts of the left really are, as this election season progresses.     As an aside: we still don't have an explanation for the 6 million dollar heist at London's Heathrow a few days ago. I've seen some speculation that suggests the people who pulled that off were Bin Laden's people, trying to secure other means of financing, since their assets have been frozen around the world. Interesting but unsubstantiated as yet. (In public, at least)

      The supposedly peace loving liberals among us must feel blind sided as regards the middle east these days, as they are a great many things. Because of Bill Clinton's bumbling in the middle east, we're now closer to war than we have been in years.  Ah, yes... middle east peace. Never have so many westerners given so much for so little. So great is the need to  believe that  sacrifice and bloodshed will not be necessary; and that peace and prosperity are the universal goals of mankind, that they were willing to accept the help of a known liar toward their goal of, as Nevile Chamberlin put it; "Never to go to war with one another again".  Thing is, facts refute liberalism. The middle east is no different than any other armed conflict in the history of man.  Others learned the lessons, painful as they tended to be. Chaimberlin's England, for example,  along with  the remainder of the free world, learned about appeasement of a mortal enemy the hard  way.  The American left, apparently not having leaned the lesson taught by the infamous socialist, Hitler,  was taught the lesson again, by another band of socialists, as Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan.  It is clear reading Jimmy Carter's comments on the era, that HE hasn't learned anything from the experience, to this day.  I doubt the remainder of the American left have leaned their lesson yet, either As evidence, I point to the recent events in the middle east, and their foolish forbearance of Clinton's vain and blind pursuit of his legacy... right in the same spot Jimmy Carter tried so hard to earn a legacy that, alas, lasted around, oh, fifteen minutes. Al at the expense of Israel.  Israelis seem to be waking up from the over-long self delusion... one that's been going on since President Clinton decided he wanted to try and create a legacy for himself, other than Monica, and a string of dead bodies and other scandals. One wonders if leftist Americans will EVER wake up.  From Oslo to Camp David, Clinton has pushed Israel to the bargaining table, and pressured her to give up vital strategic and cultural assets she has no business giving away, if survival is at all on her agenda.  Ehud Barak, by his giving into Bill Clinton (who, along with his staff including Jim Carville, did much to  put Barak into office), has done little more than demonstrate  just how empty the Palestinians' peace talk really is, and how desperate Clinton was to be seen as a good President, his crimes against his oaths not withstanding.  Consider....  At Clinton's insistence, Barak offered Arafat  the keys to the kingdom; just about all of the West Bank and Gaza, plus East Jerusalem and even Palestinian sovereignty over the Temple Mount. How do the peace loving Palestinians respond?  Yasser Arafat turned it all down, and gave us another few nights of headlines, filled with kids in the street throwing stones, and being shot, occasionally. He also sent his armed forces, (You recall, they're supposed to be policemen?) to fire at the Israelis, apparently hoping for an excuse to tell the rest of the world how Israel is a war-mongering nation.   Of course that should have been a signal to about anyone with a brain that he didn't give a damn about peace. All he and his followers are interested in is the destruction of Israel. It should have also been a signal that Clinton's attempt at a legacy backfired, big time, and more, that it didn't have a chance to start with.... something that Clinton should have known, did he have any understanding of the situation at all. You will recall, perhaps that back in 1992, Clinton more or less bragged he had no understanding of matters of foreign policy. This was never quite so clear as during this monstrosity Mr. Clinton unleashed on the world.  For Israel's part, all of this has been laid at the feet of Ehud Barak, perhaps unfairly. No, I don't think he was the man for the job, and clearly was only in the PM's position because Clinton's people worked so hard to get him there, apparently hoping to set up Clinton's brokering a of peace deal. Easy to do when you have the PM of Israel owing you his election. But Barak apparently was under pressures he had no control of, having nothing to do with politics at home, or the Palestinians... both of which were quite out of his control to begin with, in any event.. He was concerned with Israel continuing to get support from the US. In this concern, he saw Israel as being on the controlled end of the puppet's string... and knowing that if he did not capitulate to Clinton's demands, that vital US support would wither as quickly as Benjamin Netenyau's prime ministership did, when it became clear he wasn't  going to buckle to Clinton's concession demands.  And Barak wasn't alone, nor was the left in Israel, in this perception of US control versus Israel's survival. Yitzhak Rabin, hardly a liberal even by American standards and certainly not under Bill Clinton's extortion based control to the extent that Barak was,  saw the same problems. His longtime friends, according reports I've seen, tell us he was deeply troubled over the prospect of losing US support... and therefore bought into the 'land for peace' deals being brokered by the liberals in the US. This was something I predicted he wouldn't have done.   Israeli voters, seeing this happening, and clearly annoyed with the US control over Israel's dealings with the Palestinians, trounced Barak in the polls. Unless one considers this anger, the election of Ariel Sharon, his replacement, is hard to fathom, since he has never been overly popular, as best I can tell. But perhaps  the people of Israel are finally figuring out what the real story is.. that in truth, there is no dealing with the Palestinians, and Arifat.  One hopes that they've not been too late in coming to this conclusion. If they are, world war seems fairly certain to me... possibly nuclear in nature.  However... also of great  import, I think, and far more certain, is the damage that has been done to our ability to deal with other countries on the world stage, even on the assumption that Israel survives all they've given away under Clinton's threats. Our foreign policy influence has been diminished, because other countries, seeing what has gone on with Israel, one of our best friends, will trust us less, when we come with the helping hand. They'll be, perhaps, wondering what the OTHER hand is doing. And after Bill Clinton, who could blame them?  And no... as much as I loathe Mr. Clinton and everything he stands for, I'm not piling on. I am simply issuing a warning that the damage he has caused will take a while to heal, if it will ever do so. And that we should avoid making such choices in the next several elections.  Never again should we as a nation or as a world, allow ourselves to be pushed into the situation we found ourselves in with Mr. Clinton's attempts at salvaging face.   Our future, assuming we actually have one, will depend on it.

      Well, it's past the 100 day mark, and what do you know?   President George W. Bush is doing far better than anyone in the so-called mainstream media predicted, or indeed, is ready to admit to the people now.   The president has garnered approval ratings in the low 60's in two seperate mainstream media polling projects. One from ABC, and the other from CBS... the latter of which, as usual, when finding polling numbers that don't reflect their Marxist idealism, buried the report.   Matter of fact, Bush's poll numbers are better than BIll Clinton's were, eight years ago. Of course mainstream press and their leftist freinds, when you can get them to admit the polling numbers at all, will tell you it can't be because people like the way he does things, and like his polcies. No, they're still working on the tired, and often disproven notion that the only reason people like him is because he's got a wonderful 'Gee, whiz' smile about him, and that he can actually speak without falling over his own tounge once in a while.    And how do they justify these kind of misreads? Simple enough; they load their polling questions, as I have pointed out before many times in this medium.   Here's an example question from the ABC poll: "Do you think Bush cares more about protecting the interests of ordinary working people or cares more about protecting the interests   of large business corporations?"   Here, my freinds, is a typical socialist trick;  putting ‘real people’ on one side, and those cold, nasty, faceless figures from business in separate, warring camps, instead of understanding that these are people as well.   Another example of how they won't tell you the whole story: We've been seeing in the Usenet and on some opinion pages around the world from leftists, about how Dick Cheney is really the one running things.    Um... Guys? You may be interested to know that the polling data are in on that as well... and CBS and ABC didn't report it to you... certainly not at the levels they trumpted Clinton's numbers. But I will.   Question from the ABC polling: Does President Bush have the "experience and ability to meet the challenges of the presidency?"   63% answered YES.   Question from the ABC polling: "Does Dubya rely too much on his advisors or not enough?"   Only 20% say too much, and 62% say again he's doing things the right way.     Another example: When they asked if Dubya was too liberal, too conservative, or just about right ideologically, 31 percent answered "too conservative", but the overwhelming response.... some 62 percent... said "about right".   Gee, that a bit of a shocker, huh?  Moderates and conservatives like his policies; the far leftists don’t.  Big loss. (Shrug)   The numbers are in, guys... the public are saying "We like President Bush, we don't like the nonsense coming from the Democrat leadership, and we're not listening to you anymore, either.    OK, the polling ABC and CBS did didn't say that. The viewer ratings have, however. And the numbers are backing this up bigtime, as well. ABC, NBC and particularly CBS, are all losing viewers. Indeed, CNN is passing out pink slips already; they've all been losing Market share to Fox News, rather dramatically.   Personally, I'm rather enjoying watching these idiots on the left, squirm.

      The similarities between the cases, and the conduct, of Ex-president Bill Clinton, and that of soon- to- be- ex- Congressman and fellow Democrat Gary Condit, are startling. This is true for both the conduct of the central figures, and the defense being put up for each.    Now, we both know that the happenings of Bill Clinton, are well documented first in ‘Body Count”  urlLink http://vikingphoenix.com/news/stn/1996/bodycnt.htm   and and in other places since, are well enough known.  So I won’t delve too deeply into them here, exept in comparison.   Last I knew,  we’re supposed to operate under presumption of innocence in this country. When we do so, we abandon the  mentality of the mob.(A mentality which oddly enough, seems rather prevelant when Conservatives are accused of something or another.) So, we’ll push aside the ideas and arguments surrounding the charge that Chandra Levy is dead and Condit has something to do with that death, for the moment.   That done, there is still much in the way of similarity between Condit’s case, and Clinton,s vis-a-vie Monica Lewinsky, and the rest of the number of women.   Consider:  In the time since Levy’s disappearance,   *Condit’s has engaged in Clintonesque evasion.   *Condit’s has engaged in Clintonesque spin.   *Condit’s has engaged in Clintonesque flat out lies.   *Condit, like Bill Clinton has apparently engaged in apparent attempt to suborn perjury.   *Condit, like Bill Clinton, is both lecherous and dishonest. An evil mix in normal life, much less public life.   *Condit, like Bill Clinton is rather cruel,  at need.  ( having obviously and deliberately misled and stonewalled Ms. Levy’s parents in the matter or where she was, and the nature of the calls made to him, by her, on his secure phone line..)   *Condit, like Bill Clinton, either delegated or ‘permitted’ aides run a Clinton-like whisper campaign against Chandra Levy. This ‘nuts and sluts’ tactic backfired rather badly, and was soon abandoned. A new tactic was promptly employed: Attack Chandra Levy’s parents.  Sounds just like Bill Clinton, no?   It gets better: we now have reports from poeple investigating Condit that they are in fear for their lives.  Just like Bill Clinton.   *Like Bill Clinton, Condit has a history of sexual abuse. Reports to show in the national media within a week of when this is written, report that Condit was investigated for it in 1983. The case officer at that time reported that the teenage girls he attacked were also terrified of Condit to the point that they fled their homes...    Just like Bill Clinton.    Also, the case file was later stolen...(Or was it simply mislaid?)   Just like Bill Clinton.   Clearly, Bill Clinton, if nothing else, has eroded our vision on the question of “private character” vs. “public virtue”.  Integrity you will recall, used to be defined as ‘what controls what you do when nobody’s looking’.  It is apparent that definition has been altered to ‘what you do when people are looking on’.   As a quick aside, let’s ask ourselves the question...  Even assuming a public figure could be a sexual preditor, and a criminal in private while being a prince in public, should s/he be rewarded for that rougish behavior with our high public offices?  Do we really want to publicly approve of a leader who supposedly does their job well, but can’t seem to keep their hands off  young interns? What kind of lesson does that teach the next generation, particularly in a society so consumed with protecting women’s rights, at the exclusion of common sense?   The biggest and first rule in "The Ethics Manual of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct"  tells members to “conduct themselves at all times in a manner that reflects credibility on the House.”   Now, look gang, I really don’t care, for the sake of argument,  what you think or don’t about of adultery, per se’. It is, as it happens, still a crime in the District of Columbia, though I can’t find any record of it having been enforced recently.  (I've looked) But regardless, does the House really want  to say that having sex with an intern reflects credibility on the institution?  That spin,  evasion and flat out lies to cover up such entaglements reflects credibility on the institution?   That point having been raised, the question also comes to mind, what of Bubba? Assume for the moment, that Condit gets ousted, as he should. Does that ousting mean that the only reason Bill Clinton wasn’t ousted from his office was because, of the two similar behaviors, Condit alone was the one didn’t have the power of the presidency to protect him in his misdeeds?   Yes, it does.   But there is another similarity, here. A larger, more compelling and more dangerous one... and sadly one the Democrats are more likely to ignore... Sad, because it runs against their stated purpose of helping the helpless in our society. In this, it is revealing, as well.    At the bottom line, Condit, like Clinton, is one of the powerful, not giving a damn about the less powerful.  In the Condit case, the Levys are just an average family. They have  means that, relative to Condits, are rather modest. Condit knew full well they lacked the power to cause him any real problem and so wasn't at all worried about putting his own self-interest above their needs.  This eletism may also explain why the press is so reluctant to report on the matter... CBS and ABC in particular. The so-called mainstream press has show symptoms of this eleism in the past, even the recent past. I suppose and expect this is simply one more example of it.   Just like Bill Clinton; consider the treatment of the people who got in his way.. even the ones who were his sexual servators. There is a similarity in the way the press treated these, as well. Hump as many interns as you like, abuse your power all you like.... so long as you save the snail darter.   Don’t misunderstand; This is not to suggest Clinton broke any new ground for the Democrats.  Consider the treatment of the Kopeckne Family by the press, and by Ted “Hang a left off the next bridge” Kennedy. Jesse Jackson, seemingly, is in similar trouble, and tried a whisper campaign of his own against the woman in question. William Kennedy Smith, of teh rape case of two years ago, is now considering a run for the Senate from Illinois. WHich would seem to partially explain Hillary Clinton running from New York instead of her home state, Illinois. Gee... anyone would think there's something of a pattern developing here, were this any other group on the planet. But these are liberal Democrats and so this problem goes without note.    The question has now elevated to the point of: “Are the Democrats going to stand up and be counted in their fight against the powerful abusing the powerless, or are they going to hide because the powerful happen to be Democrats?”   Alas, I fear the latter, given the long history of this situation.    But more, I fear the press, too, will let them get away with it again. And again, and again.  And yet more, I fear so too, will the congress, who will ignore their duty, all in the interests of ‘diversity’, of course.   Humping interns is a diversity thing, isn't it? Only a personal judgement, after all.   One wonders if the Amercan people haven't had enough of the judgements of such abusers. And if not, why not?   Perhaps we'd better put some ice on that.

        It is recorded in our history books that when he looked down at the ship full of smiling, victorious faces... faces of his flyers, just having returned from Pearl Harbor, Japanese fleet Admiral Yamamoto was quiet, pensive, even apprehensive. He later wrote in his private diary, "I fear all I have done is awakened a sleeping giant and filled him with a terrible resolve.         As this column is written, it is the second night after the dastardly attacks on the World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, and the Pentagon. In that amount of time, I have heard, on the news channels, and on the internet, a phase batted about several times, in various refinements, when discussing these attacks: "Like Pearl Harbor".  Something in that phrase struck a deeper chord with me. It was, at the same time, unsettling, and reassuring. And about 20 minutes ago, my memory finally coughed up that quote from Yamamoto, and with it, my entire thought process about these events crystallized. In that revelation, it occurred to me I'd already written about what I was feeling.  In that column, I wrote of my worry that our influence on the world stage had suffered seriously, under the weight of Bill Clinton's international bumbling. Well, Bumbling isn't the right word. Bullying, is perhaps more accurate, yet still not spot-on.   I said, then:     "From Oslo to Camp David, Clinton has pushed Israel to the bargaining table, and pressured her to give up vital strategic and cultural assets she has no business giving away, if survival is at all on her agenda.

Unless one considers this anger, the election of Ariel Sharon, his replacement, is hard to fathom, since he has never been overly popular, as best I can tell. But perhaps  the people of Israel are finally figuring out what the real story is.. that in truth, there is no dealing with the Palestinians, and Arifat.   One hopes that they've not been too late in coming to this conclusion. If they are, world war seems fairly certain to me... possibly nuclear in nature."       When I re-read that,  I knew I'd found what I'd been feeling, and why the Yamamoto quote had been nagging at me.  I was feeling a deep anger. Justifiable, deep and abiding anger.  Anger not only at the terrorists who arranged and executed the events of September 11th, but anger at the policies which here at home led us to this pass.   I said, back in February:      "Others learned the lessons, painful as they tended to be. Chaimberlin's England, for example,along with  the remainder of the free world, learned about appeasement of a mortal enemy the hard  way. The American left, apparently not having leaned the lesson taught by the infamous socialist, Hitler,  was taught the lesson again, by another band of socialists, as Soviet tanks rolled into Afghanistan 40 or so years later. "     What's this leading up to?  Well, dear reader; the conclusion that we are now paying the price for Clinton's presidency. One can only hope we have paid the full price…. But I doubt it.  A rash statement, say you? I think not. Consider the timing of this attack on the US.    Clinton, far from being firm with the Arabs, was giving them just what they wanted, following the World Trade Canter bombing in 1993; legitimacy, to use as a tool against us. Ironic; he's supposed to be representing US. And to boot, we were ripping Israel apart for them.    I have stated several times, that Clinton's sole purpose here was to save his legacy. But how to achieve his goal? By bowing to Arab terrorists, and bullying Israel into giving in. So, while that's going on, everything is sweetness and light. America decides to elect George W Bush, who will (rightly) support Israel and the Arabs aren't too happy.  And since Clinton also decimated our military, you ability to mount a credible defense is so laughable as to encourage attack...   Boom. Boom. Boom. And, splat.  Likely 20 thousand people dead, and as many injured, all in one afternoon, along with the likelihood of many more to follow.   Oh, I hear you squirming already… particularly those on the left… those who have always defended Clinton before, regardless of any fact. I hear you saying:   "Shouldn't we be concerned with catching, and dealing with the people who ordered and financed all this? And as Americans, shouldn't we be sticking together?"   Oh, certainly. String them up. Cut off all relations with the Palestinians, and do it now. No question.  And Military action isn't out of the question, either.   And yes, I think we all as Americans should stand together in times like these. And, no, I'm not trying to gain political points, here... this problem affects every one of us.   Logic dictates that actually solving a problem, necessarily includes that both the problem, and the causes of that problem which can be controlled, be identified, so that action can be taken to ensure that such problems cease to exist.  Now, like it or not, we can't do much about extremist causes. But we CAN control them to the point where they don't cause us nearly the concern, by not acceding to their demands, as Chaimberlin did, and as Clinton did. We can support our longtime friends in the world. Clinton ran fast and loose with that requirement, in an effort to be remembered for something better than the long list of shady dealings and downright criminal acts, and what happened to be running down his leg at any given moment.   Trouble was, and remains, that Clinton was dealing with Yassir Arifat. Arifat's comments, following the attack, as compared to the reactions of his people, (dancing in the streets at our losses) show him to be a liar of the first order, or that the Palestinian people are not under his control, or both. As a result, Arifat's commitments were useless to us, and yet useful to the Arabs who wish and work for the destruction of America,her citizens and her friends.     Would it not have been simpler, would it have not cost less life, I ask, to elect a president who can keep his pants on, rather than get us into international trouble because of half-baked efforts at obscuring his own history? Something we should consider at the next election. As I said in February; Our future, assumng we have one, depends on it.  In any event;   My heart and my prayers go out for the persons lost, the persons yet trapped, and their families and loved ones.      My great respects go out to those rescue workers, paid and otherwise, who carry on the fight that all will not be lost. Your wounds from this, I fear, will be greater than the wounds on those you struggle to save, because it is a cold fact that you will not succeed in saving all of them, and you know it going in. To you falls the task from which no sane person could walk away unaffected... and yet you go in, willingly.  And that is a wonder to all Americans, and most people in the rest of the world.   My respects also go out to the many law enforcement and military officials who are working to gather information toward the capture of those who ordered and executed this attack... at times risking THEIR lives.  We each, all of us, need to take out own kind of action in times of crisis. We feel we have the need to accomplish something to help to solve the issue. The people I mention above are doing that, certainly.   But my personal resolve is to work hard toward making sure we have Presidents who actually respect and want a strong Israel. As a start, that means making sure we never again have a president of the lowly in-the-gutter presence of a Bill Clinton.  Yours should be as well.  I only hope it's not too late.

      01/21/03 --Rochester, NY---  About a month after the 9/11 attacks against America, I had asked the question:  ** What kind of image are we projecting? Literally! I am willing to bet that a lot of the problems between us and other nations and other cultures is a misunderstanding based on what others see of our culture in our media. Consider it this way: When was the last time you saw a movie that made the military look good? How about one that cast a positive light on the Christian religion? Or Judaism? One that showed us that the American family is supposed to be a cohesive unit, much less one that actually WAS?  So, over a year later, here comes  urlLink Fredric  U. Dicker, The New York Post's State Editor,  who basically points up the same problems, through the filter of a discussion about film director Martin Scorsese's new movie "Gangs of NewYork" :  "LET'S see: Martin Scorsese's new movie demeans Lincoln's efforts to save the nation, mocks the Union Army, sneers at volunteer soldiers, derides native-born New Yorkers, pours scorn on firefighters and police officers and fails to find a single person of quality among all of New York City's leaders, circa 1863."  It would do well, perhaps to at this point look at the output of Martin Scorsese, aside from GANGS.  * The Last Temptation of Christ. Ah, yes. Portray Christ as a sex-crazed mental defective. Wonder what would happen if he was to portray Mohammed that way?   * Good Fellas. Oh, yeah. THERE's a great picture of America.  * A remake of Cape Fear.  Even the cast of the original, which was sill alive at the time thought it overly violent.  * Taxi Driver Another great snapshot of our country and out culture. 13 year old hookers are common. Got it.  * Casino Another great snapshot of our country and out culture.  *The Grifters Another great snapshot of our country and out culture.  There would seem to be a basic theme developing here, in his list of movies, that not many are willing to see. It's one that Scorsese himself addressed, in an interview years ago:     "My parents wanted to protect my brother and myself from the horrors out there - the degradation of the poor derelicts, who were literally there on your block, in your building, on your stairs as you were going out to school in the morning; who were there, drunk, fighting each other with broken bottles or knives, or dead, literally dead.  Parents didn't want you to touch them - they're dirty, they're this, they're that. But at the same time, the church is always talking about compassion. So I've always had this split guilt: I've always felt not quite right not doing anything about it and that's one of the reasons I wanted to make this movie."    There is no question but that Scorsese is a genius at getting his vision onto film. Trouble is, as Dicker suggests:    "... Scorsese's frightening vision... is just plain wrong, terribly wrong, and wrong in a way that is an insult ... to millions of Americans - then and now. "    Dicker goes on to suggest:    "... anti-American deconstructivism has had a long run in both Hollywood and academia, and it was planted in both places by the political left ."   I'm less than convinced that such deconstruction was the original object of these films, though I can certainly see the argument for it. Rather, I suppose that Scorsese is, like most liberals driven by guilt they wish to impose on themselves, and the remainder of their society. I would go on to suggest that the level of recognition he gets, is based on this lean of Hollywood's.  But for all this inaccuracy, we're supposed to take him seriously when he says as he did a couple weeks ago, on the BBC, that President Bush is wrong to take on Iraq for "the oil" and that America allegedly refuses to "respect how other people live"? Sorry, Martin, no sale here. Worse, what is the remainder of the world seeing in this distortion?   Nor am I suggesting by ANY stretch, that Scorsese is unique in this. The larger issue here, in my view is the kind of message we're sending by holding up such films, and such people as make them, as our best? We need to consider, both as individuals making films, music, whatever, and as corporations and investors? and as buyers? what kind of message we're sending not only to those within our own society, but also to the rest of the world. What kind of message, do you suppose was sent to people all over the world trying to make sense out of the propaganda piece spewed by the fat idiot, Michael Moore? What kind of message about us, are the people in the rest of the world getting from most of today's Rap "Music"?  Small things over which we have exerted little control, are usually what drives our foreign relations.   Think I'm kidding?  Consider the pictures that the populations in other countries have, pictures they use to form their opinions about us. Most will never set foot on our soil. Yet, they think they know us by our propaganda, which is masquerading as entertainment. What else do they have to go on? You may consider this overstating the case, but I think not. Can you imagine anyone watching the films listed above, having a positive attitude about Americans?   And look, I'm by no means suggesting that we should somehow place artificial (nee: Legal) limits on the produced matter. What I am suggesting is that our country, our culture, our world, would be far better off, if the producers of popular films, music and so on were more conscious of what kind of image we're sending of ourselves. That can best be arranged by the American buying public were being conscious of the message sent in what we're buying. If we don't buy it here, it won't be selling overseas, either, and thereby we will have some control over the kind of picture others are getting of us.   Our future may depend on what others see of us. Shouldn't we be paying attention to it?  -0-  Postscript, 01/22/03: Just this morning, a couple days after writing this column, a peice by Newt Gingrich on this very topic was posted on his website, and run in the LA TIMES Op-Ed section. His conclusions are slightly different than my own, but valid, nonetheless, and decidedly worth a read.

      The Democrats started 2001 smelling blood in the water, and like any mindless shark, started snapping at anything that moved. As they start 2002, though it's looking more and more like the blood they smelled was their own. It's just that quite a few of them, like the sharks they are, don't know it yet.  They started this year of their campaign against Mr. Bush by challenging his legitimacy as president, claiming that Bush really lost the 2000 election and so shouldn't have been in the White House at all. According to these people, it belonged to Gore... even when Gore was sounding rather relieved to have not made it in. Then during the summer, the big deal was punishing Bush and the 'thieving' Republicans in the 2002 elections  More recently, it's had the undercurrent of that 2002 win pushing Bush out in 2004. These attacks have gotten so brazen and bizarre, that we are seeing indications that the Democrats plan to demonize conservative Christians as being like the Taliban, according to an article in Newsweek. All in the name of tolerance, of course.  Howard Fineman, in the NEWSWEEK, writes: Democrats "are planning a daring assault on the most critical turf in politics: the cultural mainstream" ..... " The theory goes like this. Our enemy in Afghanistan is religious extremism and intolerance. It's therefore more important than ever to honor the ideals of tolerance ? religious, sexual, racial, reproductive ? at home. The GOP is out of the mainstream, some Democrats will argue [this] year, because it's too dependent upon an intolerant 'religious right,'" Mr. Fineman says.    "This is an incendiary battle plan... essentially comparing the GOP right with the Taliban... designed to draw an outraged response from the president. Then Democrats would have Bush just where they wanted him: in a firefight at home."    Fineman has obviously not been reading Usenet, and some of the other political forums on the net, because that nonsense has been going on in there since Gore finally admitted Bush won. The usual suspects are getting more strident as they find themselves taken out of the realm of validity. But you're always going to get that in Usenet.  But the net is hardly the only place. Consider Laura Conway of the 'Village Voice': "Progressives spent much of 2001 getting punched in the nose again and again and again... all the way from the crushing denouement of Bush-Gore-Nader to the collapse of a visible anti-war movement. We lost on tactics, principles and PR. The year opened with a few thousand protesters straining to be heard at the crowning of an illegitimate president and ended with 90 percent of the country ... and no small number of progressives... backing that president's military machine. As if understanding that the left is losing the fight badly, the Village Voice wails:     "The left can ... and must... get up off the mat. The bell is ringing and the fight is now."     What is happening here is that America is beginning to understand that what the left has been executing is an attack on American culture. This understanding existed , even before 9/11 but certainly after it. It's not been until 9/11 that we as a people understood just how important that cultural base is, and how low the American left has been bending so as to attack it.  With all that Democrat partisanship as a backdrop, the left now decides to puke up charges about Bush's involvement with Enron. But as usual, the left can't seem to see the facts, so blinded are they by their desire for revenge. Consider the linkages:   Enron does fine for years, under Clinton. Under Bush they go under? Just what is Enron supposed to have gotten under Bush, anyway? Here's a clue: Other energy companies fell the same way and most often and hardest in the states where energy companies are most closely regulated. Such as Democrat - dominated California. So, Bush gets the blame? Well, let's see... Under the Clinton administration, what would have kept Enron afloat? On Nov. 22, 1995 President Clinton scrawled an FYI note to chief of staff Mack McLarty, enclosing a newspaper article on Enron Corp. and the vicissitudes of its $3 billion power-plant project in India.  ..... McLarty then reached out to Enron's chairman, Ken Lay, and over the next nine months closely monitored the project with the U.S. ambassador to New Delhi, keeping Lay informed of the Administration's efforts, according to White House documents  reviewed by TIME magazine. ...... In June 1996, four days before India granted final approval to Enron's controversial $3 billion power-plant project, Enron's gave $100,000 to President Clinton's party. ...... Enron denies that its gift was repayment for Clinton's attention, and White House special counsel Lanny Davis says McLarty acted out of concern for a major U.S. investment overseas, TIME's Michael Weisskopf reported.  And of course, Enron later hired McLarty. Lay played golf with President Bill Clinton and slept in the Clinton White House. Lay served as an adviser to the Clinton White House on energy issues. So, Clinton did what the left is now complaining aout with Bush. The difference is, there's documented evidence that the Clinton administration, in turn, helped Enron get a contract for a gas pipeline in Mozambique and other projects, according to many, many reports..  And Clinton wasn't alone in taking the money. What kind of donations did Enron cough up to the Democrats in Congress? Here's a breakdown of Enron contributions 1989-2001  Enron Donations to Senators   #1: Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) $99,500 #2: Phil Gramm (R-TX) $97,350 #3: Conrad Burns (R-MT) $23,200 #4: Charles E. Schumer (D-NY) $21,933 #5: Michael D. Crapo (R-ID) $18,689 #6: Christopher S.

Barton (R-TX) $28,909 #4: Tom DeLay (R-TX) $28,900 #5: Martin Frost (D-TX) $24,250 #6: Charles W.

Dingell (D-MI) $9,000 #11: Earl Blumenauer (D-OR) $8,500 #12: Edward J. Markey (D-MA) $8,500   *All figures from the Federal Election Commission  Confirmation:   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,42757,00.html   urlLink http://www.opensecrets.org/alerts/v6/enron_cong_senate.asp   urlLink http://www.opensecrets.org/alerts/v6/enron_cong_house.asp      Interesting; the farthest to the right they got with their donantions was left of center. An agenda, perhaps?  And of course, let's recall, shall we, that the Congressional leftists in the Congress weren't alone, here. Gregg Simon, Jack Quinn, and Johnny Hayes were all Gore advisors, and all took cash from Enron, while in that capacity. Remember these names; they will play heavily in any investigation into Enron. Bill Clinton did too, and so too, many other DNC candidates. Enron's two biggest donations to House members went to Democrats. The company spread its cash around in vast amounts, on the left. How much remains to be seen, and I doubt we will ever know. And the reason is simple: The accounting for it has been destroyed.  Recently stories about Enron accounting records that were destroyed have surfaced. What the press hasn't been telling you...at least as of this writing, is that the accounting firm, whose records were destroyed, were from the accounting firm Arthur Anderson and company.   Anderson is a company with a long history of supporting Democrats, with maximum money, and some reports place the amounts given well OVER the legal maximums. They also provided services worth millions of dollars, cooking up the books to defend Bill Clinton's nonsensical economic prattle. With this in mind, it's not hard to see why those documents have recent been reported as destroyed.  What did Enron get for all of those Democrat donations? There is much in the way of indication that Enron got special treatment from our federal government, both allowing, shall we say, non-standard budgeting practices, and international influence, in places like India, for example. Thing is, with the documents being destroyed, we'll never know.  Putting the links together, it's getting easier to see that this attempt to slander George W Bush by the Democrats will fail yet again, and will in fact backfire on them. I suspect and suppose the Democrats have dug their own grave. And like any body that's dying, some parts just don't know it yet.  Others seem to, however. Says the Washington Post this morning:      "Democratic lawmakers are divided about how aggressively to investigate the White House's relationship to the implosion of Enron Corp., with an increasing number of party officials warning their colleagues against overreaching or showing too much glee in attacking a popular wartime president."      I wonder if Tom Dashiele has gotten the message. If not, one could say the DNC is dead from the neck up, given that Dashiele is the only one who doesn't know his moves will kill the party, if he keeps it up.  If he does, he'll be doing the country a service for the first time in his overly long political career.

      12-09-01 23:14Hrs--Rochester, NY---  Poor Yassir Arafat. I gather we're all supposed to feel sorry for him these days. The years of playing one force against the other for his own aggrandizement have taken their toll. He’s just not able to fool anyone, any longer, and it’s down to put up or shut up time.  I said, just after the attack of 9/11, that "Arafat’s comments, following the attack, (Shock and dismay in carefully measured amounts) as compared to the reactions of his people, (dancing in the streets at our losses) show him to be a liar of the first order, or that the Palestinian people are not under his control, or both. As a result, Arafat commitments were useless to (the West), and yet useful to the Arabs who wish and work for the destruction of America, her citizens and her friends." Such as, of course, Israel.  Mr Bush knows this, as do his advisors, many of whom have held from the beginning, as I have, that Arafat is a sham. And yet, they know that the best chance for a peace process on paper at least, is to have Arafat as part of the mix.  But of course then comes two hard questions.    Is Arafat to be trusted?   And, even assuming he is to be trusted, will a peace treaty with Arafat’s signature on it mean anything more than paper, given that the Palestinians seem to be out from under his control?   A look at the support for Hamas, this last weekend, is an example. The ‘police actions’ Arafat’s PA took were a dismal failure from every angle you look.  The reason for Arafat still being regarded as the only person who can be negotiated with is simple; even assuming he could be removed who is to replace him in the role of head of the PA? The answer at the moment appears to be under Palestinian law, the speaker of the Palestinian legislature, Ahmed Queria, also known as ``Abu Ala,'' who would be acting president for 90 days pending new elections.   ``Do not be deluded by the word `elections,' '' said an Israeli official, speaking on condition of anonymity, in a recent Knight Ridder article, which was run in the Miami Herald recently. ``These are selections, not elections. The voting will crown the victor who has been decided by the leaders in advance.'' Queria ``is a contender that others do not want,'' said this official, who regards him as having little chance of retaining the presidency after the interim period. I have seen information, suggesting Ala is a Hamas supporter.   So far, I’ve seen nothing that will contradict this information. So, in all likelyhood, he will not be supported by the west, as well as not being supported by his own.   To my mind, this not having a popular successor, raises the issue of the legitimacy of the position Arafat now holds. In every other position of political leadership around the world, including ones  which are of rather dubios value, such as the politlca role of one Jesse Jackson, have someone waiting in the wings, to take over the role should the need arise. Even if, as in Jackson’s case, it’s one of his children.  The comparison seems to me quite apt. Arafat seems to me a very Jesse Jackson - like figure. Like Jackson, Arafat holds no real power, and like Jackson, Arafat is not even recognized by most of his own people as being in a leadership role. Nobody, including his own people, wants him around, but the people whose race and culture he claims to represent would be offended if he wasn’t given the treatment due someone of leadership status by the remainder of the world. So, Arafat gets invited to the party, and negotiates for meaningless peace treaties.  Frankly, my perception of his position comes down to this; That the only people in position to take the reins from Arafat are Hamas, makes one wonder if about Arafat’s loyalties to the concept of peace.    But all of this has now come to a head in the last week. Israel, taking their long overdue queue from the United States, has now also declared War on terrorism. And with that have come the attacks of Israel against Hamas, and their supporters, including Arafat’s compound. Israel sees itself as having the support of the world in this, and for the first time in many years, they’re right, for the most part.  Arafat responded to Israel’s get tough actions by issuing scores of arrest warrants. Problem is, the PA jails have a revolving door on them. Arafat makes a show out of arresting people and then turns them loose as soon as the dust settles. In hearing the reports these days of the arrests by the PA police, one nearly envisions Claude Rains in the guise of Captain Louis Renault in Casablanca, giving the order to ‘Round Up the usual suspects’.  Arafat certainly is playing this so that he doesn’t erode his own power base. He has long played things so as to expand his power. This tendency has been noted previously, and current events with him have changed little, his policies and actions.  But with the hard choices he now has to make, he may not be able to maintain his power, and peace, both. Peace may have to come at the price of his power. Indeed, it will be easier without him in his current position. But, no matter what he does, the danger for him is that Palestinians will look at him as having gone too far while Israel will say that he has not gone nearly far enough. Arafat certainly no stranger to playing both ends against the middle, but the stakes, with 9/11, have been raised on an order of scale. Ironicly, this is, perhaps, an unintended effect of the attack.    After an attack by Israel against Hamas positions, Arafat, clearly annoyed at having the facade of peacemaker stripped away to reveal the Hamas leader underneath, spoke irritatedly to Israel’s Channel One, about recent American pressure on him to arrest militants,:     ``Dear God, who cares about the Americans,'' Arafat said, striking the  air with his hand at his office in the West Bank city of Ramallah. ``The Americans are on your side and they give you everything, ` `Who gave you the airplanes? The Americans. Who gave you the tanks? The Americans.''     Well, Yassir, you seemed to care enough during the Clinton years, when you all but had your own room at the White House. As to caring now about America now, you’d better start, Yassir. The people in those tanks know better than the people negotiating those sham peace treaties with you, that they’ll have to use those tanks and planes to come after YOU. And, it’ll be happening soon, barring a change on your part.  After which, peace may at last come to the region.

      12-19-01 21:21Hrs--Rochester, NY---     Back on the 13th of September , a mere day and a half following the attack on America, I pinned the fault for this happening, squarely on the shoulders of one Bill Clinton, for having done the Chamberlain dance with Yassir Arafat. I've been suspecting for a long while, and made my feelings public that day, that the problem was Clinton either being collusional enough, or perhaps being more kind… flat out stupid enough, to be dealing with Arafat as if he was the genuine article.  I caught hell from the usual suspects, but that only served to confirm I was onto something. Indeed, I went further in my next several articles, saying in the most recent, that we'd have to take Arafat out. As of today, it looks like I have proof that I pinned it. Within three days, This unspeakable slimeball has tried playing one end then the other. Just today, Arafat put the Hamas leader suit back on and appealed for martyrs in the war against Israel.  In an address in Ramallah, Arafat said Palestinians should regard a Palestinian youngster killed in crossfire between PA and Israeli forces killed in the Gaza Strip as an example for the Palestinian people. And some of the reports I've seen say the kid was so busy chucking peaceful stones, he never noticed the Palestinians opening up behind him. In all likelihood, in his act of hate, he got caught between his elders act of hate, and their intended target… the victims in all of this...Israel. Arafat, trying desperately to score points with his Hamas Masters, said all Palestinians are martyrs. Now, doesn't that sound cozy? Oh, so peaceful.  Just so we know this was no fluke, no slip of the tongue… that he really meant to say this, he went farther:, saying he is willing to sacrifice 70 Palestinians to ensure the death of one Israeli. And just so we know we heard it correctly, the speech was rebroadcast several times on PA radio today. "We will defend the holy land with our blood and with our spirit," he wailed. "We do not only wear uniforms; we are all military. We are all martyrs in paradise." According to at least one account I've seen, the crowd seeing the speech live began to chant that millions of Palestinians are prepared to march as martyrs to Jerusalem.  So peaceful huh? If we take his word, that means that all bets are off, and that any Palestinian is a legit target. That's really what you want? So be it, Yassir.  And all of this, as I say, less than two days after calling for an end of Palestinian attacks against Israel. Of course, Palestinian insurgency groups have rejected Arafat's appeal, and apparently dropped a few well-worded threats, and presto-chango, he's a warrior again. Well, news flash, guys… he's always been a warrior. He's been using this 'peacemaker' act as he would any other weapon... against his enemy. That much has now been made so startlingly clear, even those of the left can no longer deny it. The PA cannot be trusted, and never should have been trusted. It's been clear to me for some years, now, but as I said some months ago…  The supposedly peace loving liberals among us must feel blind sided as regards the middle east these days, as they are a great many things. Because of Bill Clinton's bumbling in the Middle East, we're now closer to war than we have been in years. Ah, yes... Middle East peace. Never have so many westerners given so much for so little. So great is the need to believe that sacrifice and bloodshed will not be necessary; and that peace and prosperity are the universal goals of mankind, that they were willing to accept the help of a known liar toward their goal of, as Neville Chamberlain put it; "Never to go to war with one another again".  We now see where this leads us.  There is no longer any argument that the bumbling of Mr. Clinton has led us to this pass. It is now to George W. Bush to clean up the mess Clinton made, while Clinton's fellow Democrats fight him almost as tenaciously as El Quieda. One wonders, if after all proof, the Democrats continue to fight Bush's efforts, because they and El Quieda share the same goals…. The destruction of America.  The vast majority approves of Mr. Bush's actions and continues to thrash the Democrats in the job approval polling. Yet the partisans keep trying to play roadblock in our efforts against the Terrorists and our recovery efforts as well, all while blaming Mr. Bush for Mr. Clinton's doings.  The sad part is, Clinton won't pay for this crime, nor will his supporters and apologists both then and now. The really sad part is, WE will be paying for his trying to diffuse his legacy, for decades to come.

      12-25-01 10:20Hrs--Rochester, NY---  Another Christmas has come.  This one is filled with all the wonder and all of the joy that their predecessors have brought, along with some added sadness. As I sat and watched our two kids open their gifts from Santa this year, over the rim of my morning tea, a focusing  thought struck me. Is it just me or do our lives get sadder every year? I just had to write a column…  No, don't worry. I've not taken leave of my senses… I am not being overly morose here, nor am I wallowing in self- pity. There is a positive point, here, trust me.  But consider; as we get older, we become more aware of the world around us, and how hard it can be. Small concerns are our focus when we are as young as my two are. My younger boy's biggest concern is, will he get to play with his trains today, and watching a favorite cartoon. The older boy's big thing these days is watching the real trains when we get the chance to go out and see them together. (I suspect that the 'together' part is the most important.)  As we grow up, our focus changes, of necessity. It's a hard world out there, and being adults we’ve come to understand this, in a way of understanding that only long exposure and experience can bring.   Each new hurt leaves it's own scar on our souls. We see, this year, the illusions of peace disappearing in the Middle East, and we've seen the war being brought to us here in the US. There's nothing like the specter of 5000 people dying on national television to remind us we're not in control.  Seems every year we have more worries and concerns. We worry about out health, and those concerns increase with advancing age. We worry about our jobs, about our investments, our savings, about the future in general. Retirement is a concern. Will we have enough? We worry about the future our kids will have and the normal growing up problems, but we also worry about the future that we've left our kids. What kind of a world have we left them? We see loved ones die. We've seen marriages we thought would pass the test of time, pass away, instead. Things we had hoped would come to pass, didn't, and those we'd not dreamed, in our wildest nightmares would happen, did. The list of these reverses, these scars, gets longer as the years progress, and it starts eventually, to break down the positive outlook in us all…. Each according to their ability to resist.  And that, I thought, over this morning's Earl Grey, is why Christmas holds a special place in our hearts, and our traditions. The obvious spiritual considerations aside for the moment, it is a time of renewal of our fragile human spirit. All of the hurts, small and large, become less pronounced, and fade under the soft glow of the lights, the candles the fireplace, and the smile of the children.  It is the children, in fact, that do us the most healing. Our long experience has hardened us to the realities of the world around us, and perhaps jaded our point of view. Christmas gives us, individually and collectively, the chance of looking at the world though the wonder-filled eyes of a child once again. Becoming childlike, ourselves, in the process, and becoming healed and renewed.   Hmmm. Little Children, eh? (Sound of turning pages)  "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."  "And whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me."  "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these."  "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children. Yes, Father, for this was your good pleasure."  Healing, indeed!  A blessed Christmas to each of you.

      1-13-02 11:21Hrs--Rochester, NY---     Charges of racial profiling are all the rage, these days. It seems there was a Secret Service agent who was recently kept off an American Airlines flight from Baltimore/Washington to Dallas, Texas by the captain who noting the man was carrying a firearm, and hadn't filled out the proper paperwork, as mandated by the government even before 9/11, had the nerve to suggest he wasn’t satisfied with the man's credentials. So, now the agent and his attorney, John Relman, are saying that the agent was the victim of racial and ethnic profiling.  Several questions pop up here, mostly relating to common sense. Among them:  Isn't the Secret Service subject to aviation law?  Are minorities immune to aviation law?  Isn't the Captain of the flight the one in charge?  Let's look at this from his perspective, shall we? Let's assume, just for the sake of discussion that this guy IS in fact a terrorist since, after all, the captain couldn't be sure, based on the information he had. Here is, by all accounts, a belligerent SOB with a gun, and one who submitted a rather smudged carbon copy of his paperwork instead of the required original, at that. Sounds like a real winner, this guy, huh?   It gets better.  According to the reports I'm seeing, he failed in two subsequent attempts to fill out the required paperwork correctly. He was trying to board a flight headed in the general direction Of President Bush, on a day when security forces are on a maximum alert for terrorist activity. To top this off, the guy's of Middle Eastern descent.   Now, we're supposed to expect the captain to presume this idiot was who he said he was?   Now, let's say this guy IS a terrorist, and breaks out this weapon mid-flight and tries to create a 9/11 scenario. Think the families of the people on that plane aren't going to have a few questions as to why procedure wasn't followed? How about the media and the public?   These charges should be thown out without comment and the Secret Service chap should spend several years behind bars. If we are taking our security seriously, Mr Bush, I suggest you start with this idiot. Interesting, how we've not heard anything further on this one.     Consider a similar incident in injecting race where it simply doesn't belong; Check the thumbnail picture below:        You've all seen this picture before, so I won't waste bandwidth on the high-res version. The FDNY decided to commission a statue of this picture to place in their city HQ. Trouble was, they altered the race of the people in the pic. Can someone explain to me what would have motivated the 'artist' to do that?     The commonality of course is that in both cases, someone waved a magical wand called RACE and thought that would make it all better. Were whites to try this…. How long do you suppose it'd be before we saw Jesse Jackson front and center?

      Frankly, my general attitude toward watching the Olympics on TV is one  of disinterest, to say the least. I find the network coverage lacking  in several areas. Usually, in the network's defense, it should be said  that they're dealing with time factors they cannot control, but this  adds nothing to the viewed output. As a professional announcer, I  generally find the commentary obnoxious in the extreme.   I tried this time, I really did. However, Kostis and Couric not being  able to shut up at the appropriate times during the opening ceremony  forced me to turn the channel. I personally don't give a damn HOW  perky she is, or how much either is getting paid. In fact, as much as  they're getting paid, one expects more smarts than they displayed.  (Click)   I do tend to keep a loose eye on the events there via my usual news  sources, however, as I do everything else. So it was, that I was  mildly amused to see the most recent controversy in the skating world.   For all of the protests that the Olympics are not supposed to be about  politics, this event was completely driven by anti-western politics.  If proof of a long-standing effort to lessen the impact of the west on  the part of Europeans was ever needed, it was never easier to obtain  than in the judging of the skaters at the Salt Lake games. This from  the group that told us the display of the flag rescued from the rubble  of the world trade center at the opening ceremony would be too  political, and thus forbade our people from doing so, at least for a  while.   And this Olympics seems to have also given the proof we need about an  anti-American press, here in America. Coric and Kostis both have  publicly, on air, fretted about public displays of American  Patriotism, even as muted and apologetic and self-demeaning as they've  been. And the left here in this country has batted NBC about, along  with those who foster anti-American sentiment beyond our  shores…Ironic, since the NBC air talent appears to agree with their  objections.   Worried editorials have been issued, in which NBC has been roundly  chided for its "over-emphasis" on American athletes, American medals,  and American flags, and a conservative, tough talking American  President. It appears news reporters are supposed to ignore the facts.  Whoodathunkit?   It wasn't bad enough Bush teed off the Europeans with his "axis of  evil" speech, -- now NBC was making it worse by reporting patriotism,  a pro-American stance including flag-waving. It's all so contrary to  the spirit of the games…and bad for international understanding.  Apparently there was enough American at the games that NBC's  technicians were unable to edit them out, in real time, not having the  8 hours of delay to prime time, as they did at Nogano.)   All of this adds up to a not very pretty picture…at all points, an  anti-American one… even among some ostensibly American Citizens. Most  notably, The American left…. Errr… American Press. (A duplication of  terms, I grant you).   It does seem rather odd, all this flap over such a muted display of  our patriotism. Alas, that it's not strange to see such bias from our  own press however, who has long been acting in an anti-American  manner. Nor is it much a shock to see anti-American bias pop up in the  judging of events. Both, you see, have been going on for decades. It's  just they've never been so clearly caught at it; they've never been so  brazen before.   Oh, and lest we seem to be singled out, here, let's not forget the  IOC's refusal to allow Afghanistan it's chance to be seen as a new  part of the world by allowing the country's new flag to be flown at  the games. The IOC apparently likes the Afghan people under the rule  of the Taliban. A newly freed Afghan people displaying their new flag  and their new status as a free people is apparently seen by the IOC as  'too political'   I have only one question: Why are any free nations still involved with  the IOC? Why do we insist on subjecting ourselves to this one-world  feel-goodism, at the expense of our freedom?

      3-26-02 08:58 Hrs--Rochester, NY---  In watching the Oscars the other night I was struck again by the racism in our country.  What are you talking about, Bithead? Wasn't that a breakthrough night for Black America, given that Potier and Halle Berry won historic awards? Possibly, but if so, there are serious questions.   Consider the spin employed, here; The Hollywood left who controls these proceedings, worked themselves into a frenzy trying to convince us that Denzel Washington, Halle Berry and Sydney Poitier won their awards not as the very unique, remarkable, and admirable American talents that they certainly are, but tokens representing a particular group.  Take for example, the idea that there were so few whites who were given the chance to speak in the intro film for Poitier's award. Did his fine work only affect black people?  Let's also point out, gently, that Halle Berry is an example of racial integration on two legs, being half white,(her mother's side) and for that matter, so is Poitier, whose wife is also white, as were all of the directors and producers and financial backers of their projects who took a chance on them personally and professionally. These are not examples of blacks, but of individuals, which, last I heard, is how it's supposed to work here in America. That these points weren't considered seems to have a political stench to it. Where there's smoke, there's fire, it appears. Because who are the people asked to speak, and their political bent....  Laura Bush.  Jerry 'Govenor Moonbeam' Brown, Oakland Democratic mayor and dedicated far-leftist.  Fellow leftist wacko Willie Brown, San Francisco's Democratic mayor.  Lani Guinier, the far left law professor whom even Bill Clinton thought too radical to be a part of HIS administration... too heavy on the quotas...  And Al Sharpton, who intends to be a Democratic candidate for president next turn.  (A four to one far left wacko to normal person ratio? No leftist tilt in Hollywood, huh? This must be 'balanced and fair' to their minds...)  Yet, as to the substance of the awards and the people giving them, let us examine this... The claim is made that this was a special night because the barriers are falling', as Gannet's local rag, the Chronic Democrat, put it. Clearly, the perception they are trying to convey here is that there were bariers to overcome , even up till this year.   Seemingly, Hollywood is trying to convince us it was more than their talents that gave them the awards. The subliminal message is clear; it was not their individual talents, and because they were black and available on the night Hollywood needed to feel good politically about itself, by giving these poor disadvantaged multi-millionaire black actors and actresses, a pat on the head for being good little liberal blacks and not upsetting massa's cotton wagon.  Do not misunderstand my ire. I do not question that those who got awards deserved them, for the fine performances and achievements. They most assuredly deserved them. I applaud their efforts, and have personally enjoyed them over the years.  Yet, how is it that far leftist Hollywood, who has been trumpeting racial equality while pushing for quotas ala Lani Guinier, for decades, is just now getting around to handing out such awards? The left prizes such things as racial equity highly, we are told. Since they've obviously controlled Hollywood for generations, doesn't it make sense we'd see such awards to black performers previously, and without all the attempts at tokenism, if in fact the left, itself, wasn't the barrier to black advancement toward equality?   Put another way; Has the left just revealed to us it's own racism?

      Editor's note: I actually wrote this article some years ago back when I was doing editorials for a GT network BBS I used to SysOp, but I got a number of requests to post it on the net, from folks who had read it back then. So, I'll do so here. Beisdes, there's a recent update to the story.  -1-  I'm on the soap-box about lawsuits and government regulations, and warnings and such. All of this came about when I looked at a bag of ice I'd just bought, and noticed that the bag actually had a nutritional statement on it, of all things.  I was amused to learn that because the bag of ice contained 0% fat, it qualifies under government regulations, as a low fat food! (They must not be using the water from around here, then.)   It was at this point that I started to consider all the strange and wonderful messages we are hit with every day, because of government, and of lawyers. In the process, I made some interesting discoveries.   Consider:It is because of lawsuits and Lawyers that everything we buy has a ridiculous warning on it. My lawn mower actually has a warning that reads:                                       WARNING!       DO NOT PLACE HANDS OR FEET UNDER MOWER WHILE BLADE IS SPINNING.     Duh! This sticker exists because somone went to court claiming minus part of a hand or a foot, claiming he or she didn't KNOW there was a slight problem with putting their foot under a mower? Worse... a jury thought they were telling the truth, and forced the manufacturer to pay millions for this person's rehab. Far as I can tell, half a foot is the least of the problems, here.  It gets worse.   I bought a toaster oven the other day. My new toaster oven came with a whole list of warnings:                      " Do not touch heating coils. "  Gee. I wonder why?                     "Do not stick foreign objects in oven."  Aw, Gee... No French Bread?                  " For best results do not submerge oven in bathtub."  It's OK if I leave it on the EDGE of the tub, so long as it doesn't fall in, I guess. One also wonders what they would consider less than "best results".                       " Do not drop oven on your foot."  Aw, Gee. What happens?            "Oven is not to be used as protective headgear."  Not even at a party?   This list of oddball warnings goes on and on. I sometimes think my $30 toaster oven would cost $15 if they didn't have a staff of highly paid lawyers somewhere thinking up this stuff... and highly paid union printers packing literature in there with it, containing what the lawyers tell them to print.   Thinking that there is a reason for all this nonsense, that each of these warnings on a product represents a previous (successful) lawsuit, I decided to focus on one of these warnings, I chose to investigate what caused the 'Toaster oven as Headgear' business. It's amazing what you can find when you've got a fast Internet connection and a good computer... and a Saturday afternoon to kill. Turns out that I was right; there was a strange story behind it.   In this example, some moron in Tacoma went to work at a construction site one day, with a toaster oven on his head instead of his hard hat, so his pals could get a laugh. Yuk Yuk.   A Scooby-Doo lunch box another worker dropped on him injured him. (I can just picture this big burley construction worker with his Scooby-Doo lunchbox, can't you?) From the accounts, the lunchbox landed on his head. Well, it landed on the toaster oven, which was on his head. What is unclear is how much head damage was pre-existent.   In any event, he apparently wasn't warned by the toaster maker that a box of tin filled with heating coils and no padding does not protect your head from metal lunchboxes filled with baloney sandwiches and a thermos full of coffee, moving at 33 ft/sec. So, in response, he sued the toaster oven company as well as his employer, the lunchbox maker, and Hanna-Barbera, who drew the pictures on the lunbchbox  and just for good measure, the state of Washington and the federal government. (Apparently, the work site was a government building…. A Post Office. Doesn't it make you all warm and fuzzy inside knowing that idiots like this are responsible for the quality of the work on government buildings?)  Get this: The guy won $6.33 million, and then took the money and bought a brand new trailer home (the old one was pretty bad… I remembered seeing him on TV at the time) and a collection of commemorative Elvis plates. What novel choices for expenditures! I guess you can't change a real man.  In response to this unprecedented cost of doing business, the toaster oven  manufacturer decided to warn people of the rather limited uses of their product.   Now, before you get started,…./Of course/ I believe that companies should be held accountable for the safety of their products, given reasonable use. I just think that our purposes could be better served by one warning:         WARNING: Do not use this product if you are a complete idiot.   We all know about the MacDonald's coffee case. Nowadays every drive-up and every cup of coffee the Fallen Arches serves up, has a label:                           WARNING! COFFEE IS HOT!!!  Look, Gang... Let's nip this one, shall we? Coffee is hot, and it will burn you if you're not careful. If you don't understand this, then you've got bigger problems than a $2.7 million settlement can solve, OK? I suppose you are, however, qualified as a possible winner of the Darwin Award.  Now, just recently, a case against McDonalds, which was almost verbatim the same case as was brought here in the states, was laughed out of a court in London. I've not seen the particulars, myself, but the reports I'm seeing suggest the judge gave the plaintiff a bit of a chewing out, and I gather the lawyer is in trouble over it, as well. One wishes that had happened here in the states when the same case came up; the case in England would never have been brought.  The ideals we all grew up with would be served best if the next time someone goes to court to sue both Nabisco and Ford, because neither company warned him that Jell-O was not a suitable substitute for motor oil, the judge quickly throws out the case and recommends that the plaintiff avoid any pyramid investment opportunities, stairs of over three steps, yard implements, and most kitchen utensils, and many small farm animals.  A certain amount of common sense is necessary to survive in this world. Unless of course you have a jury filled with your peers... IE: Fellow idiots, willing to pay someone else's money to help you along.

      I am in shock and full of questions as I write this column. I am afraid this time, that I have no conclusion for you, and I will leave lots of unanswered questions.  Longtime readers will know this is an unusual thing for this writer.  The reason is simple: A 12-year-old boy my son knew killed himself the other night.  Ponder this in general terms for a moment, and let those thoughts seep in before you continue, because I want the reader to fully understand "where I'm at" as I write this.  Jamie, we'll call him, was a bright kid, with a genuine future. Liked his music, was a veracious reader, was in the Boy Scouts. Got good grades in school. Liked the color Red best. To my understanding, he never gave anyone cause for concern.  Before now.  Now, of course I understand that people die every day. This is not news, nor is it earthshaking. I usually write about things that are more widely reported and discussed. So, my even making mention of this comparatively small happening in the annals of the world,in this column is unusual.  Yet, when one is close to us, that death impacts us in a rather pronounced fashion. When one is particularly young, or their death is particularly senseless, that too, tends to affect us in very significant ways. This death affected me as profoundly, yet on a different level as the events of say, the WTC and Pentagon attack on 9/11 did. So of course, I had to write about it, while marveling that this tragedy should occur so close to the day when the WTC cleanup was officially completed.  We're still learning about this tragedy, even while we grapple with the emotions it causes us. At this writing, I don't know any of the problems that led to this event, so we're not even sure what to base our feelings on.  My son seems to be taking the death of his friend in stride, but then again, he's the kind to keep things to himself, only to hit you with 'zinger' comments and questions later on, sometimes months later.  So, I'm pretty much resigned to this subject coming up with my boy, at some future date... doubtless, when I am least prepared for it. Indeed, I'm rather hoping for it, since his talking about it to someone he trusts is the only way he's going to get all of this to a manageable point in his own mind.  Yet, I dread it, because I'm lacking the answers for the questions he will be asking. So, I got to thinking about all of this, in general terms, in an attempt to prepare myself for what questions he might ask, or feelings he might express.   How does one prepare for undefined, hazy questions from a 12-year-old, who is just coming to grips with the death of a friend, even an accidental one, much less one of this nature?  I suppose it would start with defining your own feelings about it. This would be foundational for my own sanity, first of all, and making sure my boy takes all the right messages away from this event. In the process, however, I found myself ending up with more new questions than answers for old questions. My own feelings have nothing but loss to be based on, so they are as a result, at best unfocused.  When a tragedy like this happens, one of the biggest questions is always 'why'. An accident is far easier to explain and deal with emotionally, than this. So, chief among the questions would be, what it is that drives a 12-year-old to end his short life?   In general, we know that there are no definitive answers for why adolescents attempt suicide, there seems to be general agreement among professionals and lay people alike, that young people who take their own lives, feel hopeless about their situation. They think that situation will never change, and so there's only one way out. Suicide seems to be a response to seemingly what the youth considers intolerable pain.  Specifically, Jamie was kind of smallish for his age, so I suppose the bully/low self-esteem syndrome could be at work here.  But I know Jamie to have been quite popular and outgoing, so there's no clear-cut answer there. A lack of parental involvement is usually on the list of possible indicators, but in this case, I don't see that as an issue, either, based on what little I do know.  We know that suicide attempts are usually speaking, unsuccessful; For every five people who commit suicide, four have made one or more previous attempts, say the experts. But so far as I am aware, there have been no previous incidents in this case. No note was left, so far as I'm aware, but this is not unusual, either. Indeed, the experts tell us only 15% of suicides leave such a note. Even a friend I know who lost a child in this manner decades ago, has no answers for me. To this day, he still searches himself for the answer to his questions, and comes away empty.  The bottom line, I guess, is that I'll never know what was going on in Jamie's mind, that night. I am left with the terrible weight of the question, "How could one so young and so apparently promising, be so troubled and not show some outward sign of it?". I don't suppose that will change.  Of itself, that's a problem, in that since I don't understand it myself, I fear that I cannot explain it to my boy when he comes to me to ask "Why?", which was a question on all our minds as we came away from the funeral, yesterday. It's hard for parents when they don't have answers for their kids.  Harry Chapin (another senseless tragedy) once wrote "It's got to be the going, not the gettin' there, that's good". So perhaps if we apply that thought of Harry's to the search for answers to hard questions like this, it's not the answer itself, but the struggle to find it, that's of greater import, at least in this case. I guess at this stage of the game, the best I can do, the best thing I can be, is here, and available, when my son finally starts asking those questions, so that the loss can be a shared one. Because, however often the questions get re-examined, all that's left is that loss.   And I wonder; would knowing, even were that possible, make it easier or harder to accept?   I'll leave you with some links to suicide prevention information in the hope that you read and learn. One less of these events would make it worth it to both of us. If you have better ones, drop me a line, and I'll be glad to pass it on, in future columns.   urlLink http://www.jaring.my/befrienders/youth1.htm   urlLink http://www.emh.org/acadia/su.htm   urlLink http://www.childsafe.net.au/SCOUTS/scysp1.html

      I recently became involved in a conversation, wherein one of the participants a liberal, started making light of the so-called American Taliboy.. Johnny Walker Lindh.  I started wondering about this, and did some investigation. Why would an avowed liberal be so concerned about Lindh's arrest?  I came away from my investigation, more firmly convinced than ever that American liberalism is self-destructive in the extreme. And worse, it seeks to destroy America itself.   That statement on it's face will create a firestorm, I suppose. But facts, particularly uncomfortable ones, usually do. I submit that liberalism as it has become here in the west is more destructive than any other single force to our American way of life. No before you go into denial, read.  To get an idea of what I'm talking about, one need look no further than Lindh. He's currently stinking up a jail cell, for having taken up arms against us, where I hope he remains for the rest of an greatly abbreviated life.   Now, I've seen suggestions, over the years, that young idealistic kids are cups waiting to be filled. So, let's see if we can determine what Walker was filled with to get him to this pass, shall we?    According to an article in the UK Guardian, the answer lies in the " faddism of  "Bay Area culture" and excessively liberal parenting". Lindh was, for lack of a better expression, brought up, in Marin County California... the liberal capital of the planet.  One article I've seen in Newsweek reminded us that 'Marin County  has even been gently mocked by the  the most unabashedly liberal cartoon strip in America, " Doonesbury" as the epicenter of the  self-esteem movement, a land of hot tubs... a bastion of moral relativism where divorces were for a time listed alongside marriages in the newspaper.'  And let's suggest, gently, that Walker's parents didn't give him much to counter that appearance.  To assert that the "family"  he came from was left wing wacko would be like suggesting that Sir Lawrence Olivier some pretty good acting, sometimes.  The Lindhs deserted their Catholic roots. The mother became Buddhist, say the reports. And though she apparently tried to get her son involved, clearly she was unsuccessful. What was clearly transmitted, however was that foundational beliefs can be shopped for as if one was shopping for a better breakfast cereal.   The former Ms Lindh had little time for her son, apparently, but did manage to find the time to be involved with far-left activism.... I've seen pictures of the woman, in Marin Country at a rally denouncing our response to Iraq's aggression. Apparently, her daughter was involved as well, since she was also in the picture, carrying a sign.   John's father Frank, meanwhile, left the home, and the wedding vows, when John was 16 years of age, to live with  no, not another woman, but another man.  The Lindhs apparently found even the liberal biased schools in California to be too restricting. No daily classes for John... Too structured. They opted instead to enroll John in a 'alternative school', whose only requirement was that the students meet a few times a month with a tutor to discuss their independent projects, which in John's case turned out to be 'world cultures'. Gee, big shock.   Now, one can only speculate from this point, because the press was reluctant to research this any further, and what I have been able to get on this point, so far after John's initial arrest, is spotty... the thrill is apparently gone for our press. Frankly, though, given the eternal state of youth, and the state of liberalism in this country, one can do this rather easily, I think.  Let's assume John was like other young people, idealistic and wanting to do the right thing. Such a desire, however, requires the understanding of what right and wrong are.    Understanding that John clearly lacked, being educated and raised by liberals.    We can for example pretty much assume that this waste of air wasn't being taught a healthy respect for American culture, language, history and so on.  I rather doubt he knew much about the founders of this country, past that they were slave owners. We know the more liberal schools, even the government paid for ones... IE' taxpayer supported, are about teaching a healthy DISrespect for all of these. While others were learning about America being the shining city on the hill, Walker was being subjected to a labeling of the US as the oppressor, the imperialism capital of the world.  Home life did noting to remove this idea. No anchor there, either... he picked up first hand at home that we are becoming a God-less society.   All very liberal, and all very destructive. No shock then, that this was leaning he ended up acting upon. No shock, that is, to everyonbe but the leftists who went into denial when these facts began to be floated.  The people in America, the liberals teach, are the victims. And of course people elsewhere in the woprld who deal with America and Americans are also victims. Of course Lindh, , being an idealistic youth, ate it all up.   Thus does a son of sunny Marin County California, give up that life to join a bunch of terrorists who hold themselves victims of western aggression. He actually followed through on the trash that American liberalism teaches.  And to this day, he cannot understand why he's in jail.   Lindh's actions should be a warning to us all about what we are up against from those who taught him. His liberal teachers, including his parents are as destructive or more destructive than anything BinLaden's been able to toss at us.

      09-01-02 --Rochester, NY---    I'm on vacation, as I pre-write this, so instead of doing this at my keyboard and desk, I'm writing this on my Palm 505, as we sit around the campfire… a Guinness Stout to one hand, trees sighing overhead, and some pork chops in the smoker, about 3 hours along. It's just about dusk, and there's a train going by on the double track about 3 miles distant. I often do jot general ideas down into my palm into my  Palm, but not often do I do it in so nice a setting. Bithead is relaxing, to say the least.   But now that I have the time to reflect, I'm reflecting on the events of the trip here.   In the last few articles, I've taken some time to point out just who and what our biggest enemy is. But in all of those, I've perhaps neglected one of the biggest: Liberal idiocy, which as usual, is disguised as 'caring and sharing', and anyone opposing them of course, is 'greed'. There is perhaps no place where the standard liberal arguments take on more of a quality of utter stupidity, than with regards to the subject of transportation in America. I ran into this in all it's glory, at a gas station on the way up here to my little vacation spot.   To put this story into perspective allow me to show you my rig: I drive a 1995 Chevy Astro conversion, with a 4.3L V6, which usually gets around 23-24 mpg on the highway, after I did some minor mods to it. (even stock, Chevy reports the unit gets around 21 mpg on the highway.)      It's rather comfortable, having powered velour seats, wood paneling, a TV/VCR combo, which feeds up to four sets of headphones for the kids, two AM/FM/ Cassette Stereo units, one which feeds the afore- mentioned kid headphones. Makes longer hauls much easier on the driver, I can tell you. It'll seat 7, for short trips, four for longer runs. It has a seat in the back that with the touch of a power button, folds into a bed. Curtains in the windows. Twin A/C units, twin heaters. Direct and indirect lighting, as well as reading lights at every passenger  position. For those of you who know about such things, this van is set on an S-10 frame. It's a really great over-the-road road rig, and already has well over 100,000 miles on it, 30k of it this year so far, with two additional long-haul trips planned before camping season ends in October. OK, that's the truck.   Trailing along behind is one of the smallest pop-up trailers on the road… around an 8 foot box, weighing, when fully loaded, around 1500lbs. Sleeps five people, if they're really friendly. This is not a 10,000lb 5th wheel…      So, keep these specs in mind as we proceed here. The importance of them will become apparent.   I left town with less than a full tank, so at around 150 miles out, upon finding some fuel priced $1.27/gal vs the $1.55 I usually pay, I decided it'd be worthwhile to fill the rest of the 27 gallon tank, which when topped usually takes around 32 gallons total. Must be a monster amount of a feed pipe on this thing. It's one nice thing about having a good sized tank; when you find it cheap, you can load up, and  roll past the $1.55/gal places.   Anyway, I pulled in, and proceeded to load up, when a rather nice looking blonde in a Camry Solaria came in for a little liquid motion. She squirted around 5 dollars worth into her car, and then looked at the amount the van had taken on. Her eyes bugged a little, as she motioned toward my pump, and her face got a little red.   "Don't you know how much gas those SUV's waste?" Once I stopped laughing, I pointed out that strictly speaking mine was not an SUV. I further pointed out that the car she was driving had only a slighly smaller engine than the one in my van… her 3100cc vs my 4300cc, and that in fact her car according to the EPA, only gets around 25mpg on the road and averages around 19mpg.   (OK truth to tell, I was a little off, as it turns out, the site http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/findacar.htm lists it as 19 and 27.. Not bad, for off the top of my head, and still not as good as my much larger Astro.)   How, I asked her, can she drive such an inefficient mode of transportation? Of course, she went ballistic, and then lacking something better to say, apparently, she pulled out the same defense all liberals do when the tripe they've been force-fed is challenged by someone with actual facts: She call me a liar. I've come to understand you're hitting a truth they can't argue with when they do that. I  suppose there are a few who will see themselves here.   She then flamed me about the amount of space being wasted, and did I really need to have all that space, did I have to drive something so large. I reminded her it was in fact a mini-van, and would she like to look inside and point out to me what space got wasted, between my wife, my two boys, the dog and our luggage. She declined, spouting some more crap which I didn't even bother listening to. She then fumed off, ripping a little environmentally friendly rubber as she went out into the street in front of an oncoming tractor trailer, who had tolock up all 24 wheels to miss making environmentally friendly liberal/riceball pancakes out of it all.   I filled the remainder of the tank, got some coffee, and continued on my way, fully expecting to see her again along the road. I never did. As I drove up to the campsite, perhaps 300 miles distant, I began to wonder a bit at the encounter at the pump. It seems to me that many encounters in various political discussion venues are rather like this one. The liberal attacker being gleefully ignorant of the real world, and calling anyone who disagrees with them (all together now) a liar.   How does all of this tie in with the stated topic? Well, rather simply, really. I submit to you that the biggest enemy of America today is not Bin Laden or any of his bloodthirsty idiots. Our biggest enemy is the willful, nay, GLEEFUL idiocy of the left, of which I was treated to a glowing example that afternoon.   Examples are many of this brand of idiocy are many, and while I won't get into a lot of them for the moment, I can hardly get by without mentioning a few of the more recent examples.   Since this is a union weekend, let's take the biggest government teachers union, the NEA, who is going to start this week to teach our kids. What are they teaching? The NEA says "Do not suggest that any group is responsible. Do not repeat the speculations of others, including newscasters" If the examples of the last few years are true, ala OKC, the only time anyone should get blamed, say the liberals, is when right wing talk show hosts can get stuck for blowing up a building. And lest you think the NEA doesn't carry any weight in this, consider the case of the New York city schools, where a teacher was suspended merely for telling her class that all of the individuals who attacked this country on Sept. 11 were Arabs. Can you beat it?   Consider the recent 'redemption' efforts of Johnny Walker Lindh, whom I wrote about recently. Consider the conclusions drawn; he simply acted upon what he was taught. What are the kids learning here, do you suppose? The lefists control over our educational system is nothiung short of a moral disarmament of the nation. For any military force to be able to protect us, there must FIRST be a citizenry that believes in their heart and soul that we are worth defending,   And the American left is exporting their nonsense, too. In listening to my short wave up here, I am hearing reports of the world summit in Johannesburg, where the free world is told among other things that the flush toilet is a major problem, culturally. Some of the other gems coming out of that are typical leftist; it's the rest of the world's fault that South Africa is so poor. Of course the fact that the place has sunken into poverty in the time that the socialist African National Congress has been in power, there., isn't the reason, huh?   So, the Africans hate us, to the point of attack, because of the flush toilet.   Then of course there's the wacko "Lettuce Lady" a PETA member, trying to get the world to become vegetarian. http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20020831/od_uk_nm/oukoe_environment_summit_lettuce_1   Of course the idiot GREENS have their say:   http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20020825/sc_nm/environment_summit_dc_25   In all of these cases, the US, and it's capitalism, the only real salvation of any of these malcontents, is being blamed by those pushing for socialism. And those who don't know any better, both here and abroad, parrot the nonsense. The conclusion of all of these connections is fairly well obvious. I submit to you that the biggest  enemy America has today, is the willful idiocy of the left, both nationally, and internationally.   The sad fact is, that people like the bleached blond I ran into at the pump have the power to vote, even if they're not sure how to work a ballot, as in Florida.        Worse, she's following the left's dictates, more or less exactly. The proponents of the left clearly haven't done much actual THINKING on these subjects they so willingly spout on, opting instead to let others do their thinking for them.   We see this kind of BS all the time in Congress, this "Blame America First" nonsense, with exactly the same basis of arguments as we see in the public venues. Problem is, such people have the power of government behind their idiocy, and thus the power to destroy America from within. I can't think of anything that would be more destructive to us than this. No matter how destructive any external attacker might be, it pales in comparison to the kind of damage that the left can do and I fact is doing to us, to us from within. I don't fear Saddam, I don't fear BinLaden, nearly as greatly as I fear the American leftists protecting him, and challenging America's right to protect herself.   It's been noted that the destruction of America is the one goal that American leftists share with Bin Laden and Saddam. Will we let them? We're now around a year away from 9/11/01, and it's lessons. The question is, have we learned them?

      In watching the "debate" over attacking Saddam Hussien, there is one point that the detractors seemingly keep failing to mention... This man and his supporters are driven to destroy both the people and the culture of these United States.  I wonder, frankly why they would do that. Let’s examine the reasons.  I have stated several times in this column that I hold politics a means to a societal end... Whatever that end might be for the individual or group.  On that basis, one would normally argue that the societal end of any American citizen should at least include, if it doesn't focus directly on, the furtherance of western culture in general, and American culture particularly. Well, common sense would dictate that at least.  If we make the assumption that most follow that rule,  we can make three observations very quickly about those those arguing against our waging war against those who have declared war against us, and have acted on that declaration .  The kindest observation would be that the people in question seriously under-estimate the danger presented to the stated goal of supporting and extending the sway of western culture. In short, To hell with the country, and for that matter, the rest of the world ... So long as their short - term political goals are satisfied.  Since, as I say, this is the kindest cut, it only gets downhill from here, I’m afraid.   The second, less kind observation would of course be that they are operating outside the group of people who are for the furtherance of our culture, and so they simply don't care about it. Apparently, there are many libertarians who are in this position. I find their position singular in it’s short- sightedness. Since they are in the extreme minority, I won’t delve very far into this one, except to suggest that this is the major flaw in the stated libertarian philosophy; they think government should have no influence on culture…. Forgetting, apparently, that the original purpose of government was to reinforce and extend it.  The third, most damning, and possibly most accurate observation would be that the people against our defending ourselves are working directly against us and directly for the destruction of our culture our society and our way of life. There are many, I fear, who are quite squarely in this last group. The majority of them are Democrats.  Now, lest you think this an outlandish statement, consider the new book by one Yossef Bodansky called "The High Cost of Peace", which I’ve only had a chance to go over quickly as this is written.  At first glance, this book will be worth picking up.    Bodansky, in his book reports that former President Bill Clinton betrayed pro-American Syrians who sought to oust the reviled, terroristic, drug-dealing Assad regime.   Catch this act: Bodansky goes on to suggest that dozens of Sunni officers in mid-1999 wanted to overthrow Assad and bring Damascus into the modern world with economic development and a representative government. They asked the U.S. for help. So, the U.S. Embassy responded by requesting a list of the coup leaders and details of the Plan.   "Naively, the Syrians complied," Bodansky writes. Then "the Clinton administration decided to save Assad."  It released the names of the leaders of this pro-American coup to Assad, which resulted in a deadly purge.   "Washington betrayed an intended coup that was supposed to be pro-American against a regime that was on the United States' own terrorism and drug-trafficking lists," the author summarizes.    And Americans wonder why those in the Middle East hate us?  I would take that a step farther;  9/11 would not have happened, had another pro-American power been in place in Damascus.    And let's see what we can of those the Clinton administration befreinded.... Yassir Arifat. Reports are that he tried to assasinate Colin Powell and the Israeli president, as well, as they were on their way to a peace conference. I've written quite a bit about Terrorfat, so I won't go much further here, either.  Given these reports,  much less including the other discussions we’ve had on the subject over the recent years, I’m quickly coming to the conclusion that the Democrats, of whom Bill Clinton is only a part, are intent on the willful destruction of America.  I think you are, too.   But it gets even more conclusive.  We’re now seeing reports that there is a direct link between Robert Jaquez and Saddam Husein.    Now we find out that the government at the time… Read that Bill Clinton’s White House, and many lower level people within the FBI and the CIA have been stuffing the information that there’s a link.   http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/news/opinion/4251116.htm  Now, remember; this is a bombing Clinton tried to blame on the voices of the right. If this report is anywhere near accurate, it becomes clear that Murrah’s terrorism was the left was doing it’s work, And as usual blaming the right.  So we arrive back at the question of why liberals would defend Saddam, with this new information about Clinton's activities in the MiddleEeast, with only one answer. There is no other logical conclusion, but that the left is working toward the destruction of America.. Just look at the stink they raise about anything that even comes close to resembling America defending itself and it’s interests.   It was Robert Frost who suggested that liberals are so open minded they won’t even take their own side in an argument. However, in this case with all respect to the talented Mr. Frost, I tend to doubt its open-mindedness that causes them to take the positions they do.   Rather, with the evidence presented us, it’s clear that Liberal Democrats are actually representing their own position; That is to say, they’re being what they are. Anti-American.  That's right... you read it correctly, that's what I said. And I mean it; Liberal Democrats have exposed themselves as being Anti-American.   Remember that, come Election Day.

      A Lott over Nothing     12-18-02 --Rochester, NY---   First, before I even draw breath, let me mention my personal position against segregation.  I take that off the table right now, because what I say after this will without a doubt be used against me, in an attempt to paint me as a racist, even with this statement up front. So be it; at least now, they have no excuse.  That bit of Political Correctness dealt with, it must be noted that Majority Leader Trent Lott’s situation is not justified by the facts. This is a completely contrived state of affairs... created by frantic Democrats, who are desperate to regain power, in any way they can.   Consider the whole situation, here. Democrats, who are still smarting at their unprecedented mid-term losses, search for a way to retake Congress. At the least, they want to be able to limit the power of the Republicans by slashing the leadership. So they look at the new Majority leader. Now, what would happen, if we painted him as a racist? This is by no means a new trick, for them. The race card has always worked before.  They see that Mississippi has a Democrat Governor, who will doubtless appoint a Democrat to the Senate if Lott quits, under the kind of pressure they can generate, given their wherewithal in the leftist press. This would place us back at 50/50 again in the Senate.   Lott’s comments about Strom Thurmond must have seemed a gift from Heaven. Oh, wait. These are liberal Democrats. Sorry. I meant to say a gift from Gaia.  "But.... Bit!" , I hear you say; "Lott’s comments were racist!"   Were they really? Let’s examine this, by looking at what he's actually said, not what we're supposed to think he meant:     "I want to say this about my state: when Strom Thurmond ran for President, we voted for him. We’re proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn’t have had all these problems over all these years, either."    Hmmm. No direct reference to segregation there. The people linking this to segregation are in reality those looking for an excuse to take offense, and at that, one has to do some serious digging. Talk about manufacturing a controversy!  Segregation as a problem of that day in 1948 aside, what was at the core of Thurmond’s run for the White House was strict constitutionalism. Yes, I expect there were many of the day who supported Thurmond on the issue of segregation. Yet, I think where the run got the most support was on it’s lean toward a strict constitutionalism. Meanwhile, where it eventually lost the most support, was with regards segregation. Regardless of how good the concept of a strict constitutionalism may have been, most Americans couldn’t get over the race issue, and Thurmond lost. Both the gain and the loss were justifiable.  But consider; It’s no accident that those who are against a strict ‘original intent" reading of the constitution call such a reading ‘racist’, and that… what do you know... these are the same ones ‘taking offense’ now.  I have no indication provided me by any available facts, that Lott, wasn’t speaking of the constitutionalism aspect of Thurmond’s 1948 presidential run. The assumption that he is making racist comments sells better, I suppose.  Perhaps it would help to note the words of Dick Morris:     “...one third of Mississippi  blacks vote for him, year after year. He took the lead in doubling funding for historically black colleges in Mississippi, sponsored the bill to make racially motivated arson a federal crime, broke the filibuster to get the Africa Free Trade bill passed and brokered the deal that led to a vast increase in federal Title I education aid and earmarked it for poor schools.  And he helped get the Congressional Gold Medal voted for Rosa Parks. “     Gee, a real reacist there, huh?  Further, a comparison or two is in order. I mean, let’s test this supposedly well-known Democrat sensitivity to racism, shall we?  Does nobody recall Slick Willy Clinton honoring William Fulbright? I don’t recall anyone, black or otherwise, lining up to take a stab at ol’ Bubba for speaking warmly of HIM, do you? I’ve even been unable to find any record of anyone within the DNC or within Congress raising their voice in objection.  And of course there’s the Grand Wizard, Robert Byrd, which no Democrat will EVER go after, regardless of the comments made. I recall like yesterday, his saying on Fox, that..     "…there are white niggers. I've seen a lot of white niggers in my time."    Was he talking about whites who act like blacks, I wonder? Years after Byrd supposedly renounced the Klan, he wrote in a letter, he would never fight…    …"with a Negro by my side. Rather I should die a thousand times, and see Old Glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again, than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels, a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds."     It was Byrd who fought against the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act -- an act which was supported by the supposedly racist Republicans – and fillibustered it for over than 14 hours.I wonder if he mentioned his little dog, Billy.  Byrd also worked against the nominations of the Supreme Court's two black justices, Thurgood Marshall and Clarence Thomas.  Certainly, his Fox interview alone is a greater and more direct offense than Lott’s indirect and unwitting connection in his comments to segregation. If using ‘Nigger" on a news program won’t get his butt booted out of office, much less the remaining racist history of Byrd, nothing will.  Michelle Malkin, who I find myself respecting more and more of late, accurately notes that if Byrd were a Republican:     "Maxine Waters and Ralph Neas and Julianne Malveaux and Al Sharpton and all the other left-wing bloodhounds who sniff racism in every crevice of American life would be barking up a storm."    Yet, it is the supporters of such as Clinton, Fullbright and Grand Wizard Robert Byrd, who are going after Trent Lott on his supposed racism? Forgive me, but I smell a fish.  It gets even worse when we reflect on Byrd’s comments about Clarence Thomas…    " I'm very sorry the matter of race was injected here, not in an effort to clear one's name but in the effort to shift the ground. And so, instead of making an effort to clear his name in the minds of the committee members and in the minds of other senators who are not on the committee, he shifted the blame to the process and to race prejudice. I think it was preposterous..."     Much the same could be asked of Byrd and his fellow Democrats, here.  And now we see chatter from Lott’s home state that the man being considered to replace him should he quit, is Clinton co-criminal Mike Espy. I must say, I’ve never seen so brash a coup.  Make no mistake; this was planned from the get-go. Evidence for this, comes right from my own hometown in Rochester NY, where the attack pattern of the Democrats is all too clearly established. The executive of Monroe County, Jack Doyle is suffering much the same fate as Lott. I've met Jack Doyle, and can tell you from even that minimal understanding, that the man is no racist.   urlLink http://www.democratandchronicle.com/news/1219story5_news.shtml   I'll post a little of this article, because the D&C is not known for keeping stories online for a long time, apparently having some kind of space issue on their servers.  More or less from the Article: (edits added to clarify for non-locals)   The comment in question was published Monday in a list of quotes (the Republican) Doyle and (the Democrat Rochester City) Mayor William Johnson . made about their frosty relationship and about governing. Doyle said: "If there was a mayor that looked like me, it would be a whole different landscape."  During the interview, Doyle was asked whether he meant it as a racial issue, but said "No" and responded, "If there was a Republican mayor, there would be no end to it. Do you know what this city needs? It needs a Republican mayor to go in there and clean the bureaucrats out and straighten this city out. This city is disassembling, it’s deteriorating. And I live in the city."  Doyle is on record as commenting later: "Any crass political effort to twist these comments into a racially charged statement is entirely inaccurate and can only be explained as partisan politics at their very worst,"  (I strongly advise you visit the D&C site, paying particular attention to the investigative links at the bottom of that web page… as long as it lasts.)  The pattern here is too obvious to ignore… after years of there being no worries about racial discrimination from the left, now suddenly, there’s a national crisis? The tming of this is questionable at best. Forgive me, but this is obviously a co-ordinated effort.. The Democrats have shown their hand… they will play the race card in this is desperate effort to steal power again, by any means they can… in this case dealing the race card they've been holding up their sleeve….   The card they won't play against their own racists, black, white, or whatever.

      Churchville NY—  Tonight, I'm treating the kids to a little train watching, at a favorite spot of ours for this purpose, which is just west of Rochester, out along I-490. (Sanford Road, if you have a map and are curious) It’s cold, around 28 F or so, and there’s a light reflected from the sky over the the foot or so of the white stuff we picked up over Christmas day around here.  After having no snow at Christmas for a few years, this is a wonderful change, other than having a devil of a time finding a spot to park; my usual being covered by around two foot of snow drift.  As luck would have it, this is, then as now,  one of the busiest rail corridors in the country… the old New York Central Water Route. Today, this line is run by CSX transportation, and still moves around 70 trains per day, and Amtrak moves 5 to 10, depending on what day it is. Power sets of 6,000 to 10,000 horsepower are common, these days. It’s a big and colorful parade, a display of power unmatched anywhere. It’s free, except for the small amount of fuel needed to get here. Often during the summer we'll take some camp chairs to this spot, and a cooler, both of which are always in the truck, anyway due to our other family vice... RV camping.  There’s history trackside, as well… and a springboard for educational discussions with the boys. For example, in 1865, this very roadbed, was the route of funeral train of our first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln.     The train is pictured here as it is leaving Chicago the day before. This place wasn't even a town, yet. But the track was here.  A few years later, just west of here, about 20 miles or so, the fastest machine on earth in May of 1893, the old NYC 999, and it’s engineer Charlie Hogan set it’s record speed of 112.5 mph, while pulling the Empire State Express.  Hogan averaged over 100MPH for around 5 miles, on a slight downgrade. Apparently, Hogan just "wanted to see what it would do", so once he got west out of Batavia station, he let the valve all the way out, and hung on, across the flats to Buffalo. Listening closely, I can almost hear its whistle.       Old 999 is still around today. It's currently at the Museum of Science and Industry. The drive wheels you see mounted on 999 here, are 78inch wheels. The record run was done with larger 86in wheels. This would be like adding an overdrive to your car, more or less. One imagines the larger ones were removed so as to remove the high speed temptations from this already long-  legged power.   Later, the 20th Century Limited blasted through here, at an only slightly more sedate 80mph as a matter of routine behind sleek, streamlined silver and black Hudson types, like this one, a J3a designed by Henry Dreyfus:    Those same engines pulled troop trains during both world wars. Out the windows of those trains was all too often the last glimpse of home many that fought in those wars, had. One cannot be anywhere along this main line without feeling at least some small sense of history…. A history I am taking pains to ensure my sons know about.  Here's a link to some more about the area.  urlLink http://www.townofriga.org/History.htm    As usual, my trusty Palm Pilot is along on this trip, both for logging train spottings and for writing. Turns out the Word Processor I got for this Palm last spring is some of the better technology money I have spent recently. It’s getting a workout today for this column, because it’s future history I’m concerned about…. Which is to say, I’m concerned over what historians will say about us, looking back.  After all, it’s the day after Christmas, 2002 and strange events cloud our horizons. It is a time is for such thoughts, I guess. Not that we plan it that way, it just happens, more or less. It was just last year that I wrote about how our lives get sadder every year, more care-worn. Our scars this year have not altogether healed from last year, and more have developed since then, and if I read the signs aright, yet more will follow. And there are those who want those scars not to heal, apparently for reasons of their own… reasons of power and of politics. And as I sit in this historic spot, watching trains rolling by, and looking at 2003 rolling in, I can’t help but wonder what the people of the past would think of us, and what people of the future will think, as they look back on our times.  A few days ago, a black friend of mine and I were discussing the problems surrounding Trent Lott, from the point of view of blacks. He knows about this column and is a frequent reader… occasionally he is a harsh critic, usually, however, he's a passive bystander.   I asked him in passing if he’d seen, and what he thought of, the Lott article that I’d posted last week. I did so as someone would as they were stepping into a minefield. It did cause an explosion from him… but the explosion went a completely different way from what I envisioned. I had fully expected to hear about how racist Lott was and how he and his ilk… well, you get the idea. What I actually got was both totally unexpected, and encouraging.  My friend started in loudly, on what he called the ‘purveyors of white guilt in America’ I must confess, I was both taken aback and interested. He asserted… (rather stoutly, I thought, as if he’d been thinking about this very subject before I’d asked) …that this was another example of the Democrats playing the race card, more or less agreeing with what I’d written in the first article on Lott. But from there, he took an unexpected turn, as our conversations often do.  He noted that for example, "the press leans on the usual leftists and race salesmen for quotes to fill their papers… Jackson, Sharpton, Kweisi Mfume, as well as a whole mess of WHITE leftists, who supposedly better represent modern black thought than actual blacks.   Nobody asked Ward Connerly, Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, or Shelby Steele, or Condi Rice, for that matter, what THEIR thoughts were. It’s almost as if they can’t allow themselves to think that blacks might NOT agree with whatever the Democrats are saying." And that, he concluded, would only hurt blacks in the end, and in so doing, all Americans, by eliminating open debate on such matters.  Encouraged by his thoughtful and unexpected response, I prodded him further, asking him directly if he didn’t think Lott’s comments racist. "Depends how you take it", said he. "Sure, it can be twisted into that but I don’t think he had that in mind. And it wasn't what he said directly, anyway.." He went on in somewhat more subdued tones: " Ya know, this… all this…this business from Lott, is a power grab, trying to get Congress back, like you said in your column."   "But what is also is,", he continued  "is a diversion from what the Democrats have been doing to blacks as INDIVIDUAL PEOPLE. Ya’ever notice that when blacks and their rights are brought up by the Democrats it’s always in the plural, never the person, the individual?   When they claim to be working for the group, they always seem to forget the individual!"   I was intreuged and wanted more of this point, but he was on a roll. I’ve learned to let him go when he gets into these moods. He wanders some, but somehow he always seems to tie his thoughts together in the end, if you give him long enough without interruption. So, the discussion wandered into his frustrations with our local school system. He then drew a less than obvious comparison:     "Democrats like throwing cash at inner city schools that are falling apart and not really teaching the kids. Why? Because they have a ‘white guilt’ complex, and they need to make themselves feel better about that guilt. Never mind that you’re flushing money down the crapper hoping some of it floats back up. Never mind that using tax money that way is a sheer waste … that doesn’t matter… What matters to them is that after tossing that tax money around, they can send their kid to the private schools in the ‘burbs…. And with their big government paycheck, they can afford it, too. And guess what? Those schools they send THEIR kids to, are all WHITE, too…"      "Imagine what would happen if we were given the chance to take our kids out of the city school system, and instead use that money they’re tossing around, to send our kids to the schools of OUR choice! "    At this, I understood the larger point he was driving at, and he’s right, sadly. Blacks and other minorities being guaranteed a good education is supposedly why the left steadfastly refuses to allow the money to be diverted from the government  school systems, toward schools of the parent’s choice. Yes, that dreaded "v" word. Yet, this attempt to supposedly help ‘the black community’ by removing their choices is actually hurting it, by hurting the black individuals within that system.  I have several articles by Doctor Thomas Sowell stuffed into the word processor in my Palm, here. Among them, I find:    ... "According to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black think tank, over 60 percent of black parents support school vouchers so that their children can attend better and safer schools. Civil rights organizations and 69 percent of black elected officials oppose vouchers. In the "service to their masters," namely the National Education Association, civil rights groups and black politicians fight tooth and nail against vouchers. Their payment for helping to protect the monopolistic stranglehold on education is political and charitable contributions."       Unfortunate, though, that what gets sacrificed here is the individuals who would be better served outside the government education monopoly so pushed by leftists.  It interests me that anyone raising such issues, tend to get labeled as ‘racist’… unless the speaker happens to be black, as Doctor Sowell is, at which point, the cries of ‘racist’ get muddled between silence and mutters of ‘Unc Tom’. Williams happens, by happy chance to have put up an excellent article on these points, just this week, at  urlLink http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams1.asp    I guess what I’m concerned about here at that so many problems that the leftists and race baiters like Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Kweisi Mfume, Maxine Waters, etc, and the entire Democrat leadership these days, want to call racism, are actually nothing of the kind. Doctor Williams in another article I have stuffed into the Palm here, speaks to this point:    "At one time, black Americans didn't enjoy constitutional protections. Today, we do. As such, the civil-rights struggle is over and won. That doesn't mean that there aren't other problems, but they are not civil-rights problems. If we diagnose them incorrectly as civil-rights problems, however, their solutions will remain illusive."    If those problems never get solved, these folks can keep blaming the right for the problems, and doing nothing to actually solve the problems. It’s a vicious cycle, that I’m afraid consumes those at the center of the storm as well as those on the outside…. The minority as well as the majority.  And, I wonder; what will historians say of the bald-faced lie that the Democrats pass off on us as regards Trent Lott, in an attempt to regain power?  Consider;  Historically, "White Guilt" has proven an effective tool against the opponents of the left. Has our ‘guilt’ been so engrained in us by these flimflammers that we roll over and beg for mercy every time the subject of race comes up? Do we give in every time the left starts hollering ‘racist’? Are we so far gone in what the race baiters have been selling us that there can be no honest disagreement in how to maintain the desired racial equality?  Yes, I’m afraid we are… to both the detriments of both the racial minority and the racial majority. The reaction of the right, to the charges against Lott is a prime example. In most cases, Lott's included, race isn’t the real issue at hand. Its’ merely a prop, a cover, for a deeper power struggle. And the biggest victims of this ruse, I think, are the people it’s purveyors are supposed to be helping…. The minorities, that is, and the majority, in the bargain.   What would Lincoln have said if he could see us dealing with this issue today, aside from the comments about ,not being able to make the weak strong by making the strong weak, of course… a comment Liberals seem to ignore as a matter of routine.   And 110 years from now, historians will look back at the doings of these race baiters and report this was our failing. What will the state of racial equality be then, I wonder? Will we have worked our way out of this cycle by then, or will we still be stuck in these well- worn ruts, which were designed for the maintenance of Democrat-party power, like the one that railroaded Trent Lott?

      It's snowing tonight in Rochester. About everything is shut down. So, I'm spending some time, drinking a bit of Irish Coffee, and warming myself in front of a roaring computer. Looking outside, we've got a fresh snow measuring a good foot on the ground, and it's showing no signs of stopping. A practically dry Christmas, and now this. It's metephoric, I think for what I see going on in the political world of late. Take these last few days for an example...  Democrats, we are told, are looking for a new voice, one who shares the vision of the American people for their future.. someone who doesn't represent big money, and who represents fairness.  So, who comes to the front of the line? Who do the Democrats claim is the answer to their quest?  None other than (drum roll, please) Sen. John Edwards, the Multi-multi millionare lawyer.  Edwards, as you may know, made all his money, being a professional  ambulance chaser.  He was on all three  national TV morning shows, all at the same time, the morning after his announcement. You couldn't escape it, if you had the TV running. That they have this timing  suggests a willing press being used as campaign fodder by the Democrats who are struggling to get back into the spotlight, after the voters kicked them out last November.  That rather obvious point aside, the Democrats will tell you with smiles on their faces that Edwards largely funded his own Senate campaign with a $20-50 million fortune. What they don't say, what's hidden behind the smile, is that he got all that money as a trial lawyer, winning huge medical malpractice and products liability claims.  Back in the day of the debate over the Tobacco settlement, many Republicans, including then House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., singled out the multibillion-dollar contingency fees contained in the proposed tobacco settlement for "enriching a small group of trial lawyers" rather than aiding  children's health.  Newt was right, too... and Edwards is one such person.   In 1997, a suit leveled by Edwards, gathered a state record $23.5 million award. Edwards went on to break his own record later that year with a $30 million award. In an area of practice where the mouth piece gets around 30% fees, one can easily see the attraction.   However; that amount of money, and that kind of voting history comes with a cost, assuming the the Republicans are willing to extract such a cost... we know full and well the press won't. That cost is simply described. Edwards is going to be hard pressed to sell himself to the public as 'Joe Everyman', given his millionaire status. His vote record certainly doesn't reflect the desires of the average American, either, further eroding his chances. While the so-called mainstream news media  calls edwards a moderate, let's consider they did that with Bill Clinton, as well.   Since they won't tell you about this, I will.  Edwards voted NO to partial birth abortion ban Edwards voted  NO to eliminating the marriage tax penalty. Edwards voted  NO to repealing the estate tax Edwards voted  NO on the confirmation of Interior Secretary Gale Norton Edwards voted  NO to the bipartisan tax cut plan Edwards voted  NO to temporarily suspending the gasoline tax. Edwards voted  NO to limiting the social security tax to 50% of total benefits (it had been 85%).  Edwards was backed by Bill Clinton, who raised around 400,000 dollars for him. Edwards voted  NO to stopping the use of federal funds to distribute the "morning after pill" on school grounds.  Is there any doubt that this is the record of a far-leftist?  This... this  is supposed to be new, and refreshing?   This is not supposed represent big money? This is supposed to represent fairness?  Sorry, but this is nothing more than the same often criminal tripe the DNC has been pushing for decades.  Clearly this support of a rich lawyer is nothing new for the Democrats, who have been in the hip pocket of the American Trial Lawyers Association (ALTA) for decades. Thing is, for all Edwards' blowing smoke about healthcare as an issue, and for all the noises form the DNC that this will be an issue come next Presidential election, has anyone seriously looked at the role Edwards and his ilk have played in the worsening healthcare situation in this country?   Perhaps we should do so here, since again, the so-called mainstream News Media won't. And certainly Edwards the ATLA and the Democrats won't.  The biggest problem with doctor fees right now, are insurance costs. Malpractice insurance is driving good doctors out of their practice. ATLA falsely blames insurance companies. So does Edwards. But wait! Ask the question:  Where are the doctors going? They're retring, but the ones that aren';t ready to retire yet are leaving for states that have Tort reform on the books... you know.. the tort reform the ATLA and their puppets, Democrats, are against, and are lying about, while states without tort reform are losing doctors to the exodus. As a result, the United States increasingly faces a health care crisis.  This is not the fault of the insurance companies, but rather of the kind of outrageous lawsuits that we've seen. Trial lawyers like John Edwards are the biggest reason why. The 'get all the money you have coming to you' commericals we're all assulted with daily of late from lawyers like Edwards have a price... and healthcare costing more in those few places you can now find it, is that cost.  The gargantuan awards in malpractice lawsuits brought by Edwards and his fellows,  have caused a lot of insurers to abandon medicine altogether, and those that remain have been forced to raise premiums to rates that have been bankrupting doctors... yes, even those who have never had an insurance issue.  Some of the doctors I've seen reporting on such matters, say they're getting hit with rate increases of between 20 to 400 percent in the last few years.  This can get into the range of $200,000 per year, per doctor. Gee, do you suppose this might affect your healthcare coverage costs?   A report in the paper, "Roll Call", 86 percent of the $1.39 million raised by Edwards' recently formed political action committee came from fellow trial lawyers. Roll Call writes, "No other Congressional leader or potential presidential contender has such a heavy reliance on a single industry for their leadership PAC."  The reasons for such PACs, along with the ATLA want Edwards in office is to gather them yet more money. Problem here is they'll finish the job they've started; killing off affordable healthcare in this country. I say it again:These are the people killing off healthcare, and the people who need it. And they're running for office.  What I find particularly frustrating here, is the lying Edwards and his supporters have already started with: He makes lots of noise about 'helping the helpless', but his record is one of making a fortune and cutting a path to power, by chasing  Doctors out of business, and thereby harming the helpless who are now without healthcare they need as a direct result.  I wonder; how many people have already died because of people like Edwards? This guy wants to be elected President?  Like the snow outside, tonight, the level of  nonsense from the Democrats constitutes a snow job that shows no sign of stopping soon. Break out the shovel.

      --Rochester, NY---  The left is a group of fighters, with an agenda… and a group in search of an excuse to impose that agenda, as a solution to whatever problem happens to be to hand at the moment. Even if they created the problem in the first place.  Back in the early 90's when the SUV started becoming the vehicle of choice for millions of Americans, the left was had problems justifying their arguments against such vehicles. Having higher priorities at that time, (such as defending Bill  Clinton from his misdeeds), the attentions of the left were turned away from this.   Nowadays, the left has no such distractions, and there has been some serious concentration on an all-out campaign against the SUV. But let's examine in critical fashion, the arguments the left puts up against the SUV, shall we?  First, let's take the most recent one, being pushed the loudest by the ‘Detroit Project":    SUV's support terrorists   While this would be true if we were actually getting a significant portion of our oil from the Middle East, we're not. Iraq, for example, only accounts for around 9% of our consumption, under the normal conditions we've not had for some 10 years now.  Also, let's consider that the head of 'People for the American Way', Norman Lear who is the creator of these ads has a garage with 21 cars that includes 2 Limousines Private Jet.  Forgive me, Norman, but somehow, I doubt your sincerity on this issue. In fact, Lear is not alone. According to actual survey, over half of the people involved in this political hit movement drive SUV's.  Let's also consider the idea that all automobiles burn fuel, and often at as high a rate as SUV's, the whining not withstanding. Looking even closer, let's say that the SUV uses 20 gal per week, on average. Meanwhile the driver of the average car gets a little better, burning perhaps 8 gallons per week less. Are the folks at the Detroit project telling us that it's just the money for that eight gallons that funds terrorism, and the rest are OK?  So, by those lights, shouldn't that be ANYTHING that burns gas or uses oil contributes? Why just SUV's?   Should we be shutting down NASCAR and NHRA competitions because they're anti-American? Do we all become Amish to satisfy these people? The question becomes, of course, at what point does this Liber-Lie™  get to absurd levels?    SUV's Pollute    Again, comes the question about ALL autos. The fact is, the polution from such vehicles are no worse than the vast majority on the road today, Including the mini-coffins the left would have us driving.    There's no real need for the SUV    I'm forced to agree with Charles Galbach, who speaks to these points better than I:       "In the first place, the purchase of SUV's by businesses was the result of your close buddies, the tax lawyers and their cohorts in the not that long ago Democratically controlled congress which permitted or encouraged a windfall tax deduction for SUV's, posing as "trucks". Since the Republicans have a history of trying to bottle up lawyers, including tax lawyers, where they belong and also have a history of opposing business taxes rather than the Democrat method of manufacturing loopholes, it had to be the Democrats who conjured up this ruse. It obviously backfired with unintended consequences.  Secondly, it was the Democrats who forced the auto industry into creating vehicles that couldn't hold even 2 adults and 2 children without them being squashed inside a thimble sized vehicle. These same vehicles are underpowered and therefore unsafe on any highway at any speed. They qualify for no more than zipping around an area no bigger than your typical gated community – a role better served by the usual golf cart.  Everyone, except the rabid few enviro-whackos can see this. As a result, we see mom driving around in an oversized vehicle which is the only one that can hold her kids and a couple friends on a trip to soccer practice – or grandma driving around in an oversized vehicle which is about the only thing safe enough for her to drive on her daily errands."     To this excellent commentary, I would add one more point: Like millions of Americans, I tow frequently enough to make a truck an economical choice.  Now, I happen to do this with a conversion van.  But I could easily do this with an SUV, as well, and many do.  Cars have been so downsized that towing with anything less is simply unsafe if not impossible. As an example, I will never forget the sight a few years ago while in Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, the sight of an obviously honeymooning couple using a Dodge Neon to tow a fairly small sized popup camper. We were at a parking spot along the ocean, near a popular eating spot.  There's a sizeable hill out front. When he pulled in, I could smell his brakes burning, from trying to get down the hill without smacking something or someone.  They ate, and left. Well, they tried to…. They got stuck going back up that same hill… the car had all it could do to hold the trailer against the hill… and the trailer only weighed a couple thousand lbs.!  You do NOT want people and equipment like this next to you on the highway. But just think of all the gas he's saving, right up to the part where they both die horribly because he can't control the thing.   If milage is the desired goal, fine, go after it. Meantime, leave me something that actually works. Create something that can tow 6000lbs, without getting into trouble, is safe in an accident sitaution, and yet gets 45mpg, and is at a reasonable initial cost, and is as dependable as our current modes of transport,  and I'll buy it.  Meantime, leave me the beep alone.  Which leads me, finally, to a personal comment, to those of you who think small cars are "safe".   I hesitate to say this. Twice now, I've been at the scene of an accident… once where I knew the victims personally, and once where I happened upon an accident before the police arrived. Both fatal accdents, both one car accdients, and both situations where the person would have lived had they had something better than a Ford Fiesta in one case, or a Prius,  in the other.  In both cases, they valued a gallon of gas over their own lives, and paid the price…. And I'm left with the horrible memory of those two incidents.  I will *never* drive such a vehicle, and I don't give a hot crap WHAT kind of gas numbers it turns in.     SUV's Aren't safe in accdients, having higher accident death rates.    NHTSA figures report that 64% of SUV deaths are blamed on lack of seatbelts, not of vehicle design. And of those, a sizeable number are related to tire failures, which in turn are caused by lack of tire maintainance... simply keeping the tires up to pressure, and THAT in fairly isolated cases. When those incidents are factored out, the death rates in SUV's are actually LOWER than for the kind of tincans the left would have us in.  Now, of course comes the story from several difference sources (NewsMax, The NY POST, etc) that the people behind this are the rich Hollywood left, led by Norman Lear, who himself owns a 21 car garage. Excuse me, but I question the sincerity of this arguments' proponants.   Sorry, but from any angle... ANY angle...this anti-SUV argument doesn't hold up.  Since all these arguments are so easily defeated, it strikes me taht what we're seeing is more a poliytical ploy, than anything else. An excuse for a bigger attack. An infamous socialist (is there any other kind) Adolf Hitler, had the Jews as an excuse for his attacks. The socialists of today have the SUV as their excuse. I refuse to be a victim as they were, for the purpose of someone's political ploy for power.  You should refuse to, as well.

      It’s been amusing and educational, since last November’s elections, watching the Democrats squirm.  For example, Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschele (feels really good to say that) Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschele lately is rather like watching a mouse in a trap.  Grisly, to say the very least. Flailing around helplessly, the mouse will start frothing at the mouth attacking anything and everything… even shadows. So it was with Old Tommy Boy who started frothing at the mouth, attacking everything to his right…which these days includes just about everything.  Apparently here is a man who knows he’s never going any higher in his political life, he will never attain any more power,, and so all bets are off. Everything and everyone got his blame. Of course the fact that the media he blames for his loss is biased so far to the left that the claims of press neutrality in reporting are something of a national joke. That point aside, he also tried to tell us all how it was those who oppose him that had been projecting a tenor that has led to increased threats on those of the left. He claimed threats have increased against him and his family….  Well, let’s break out for a minute; Since the post 9/11 anthrax attacks, during which MANY Americans are sent envelopes containing white powder, Dashiele has been under Secret Service Protection. Do you think for a minute that in that situation, added threats wouldn’t have eventually made the news? Put simply, the man’s a bald faced liar. That said, let’s continue.  Dasheile went on to blame talk show hosts... "Rush Limbaugh and all of the Rush Limbaugh wannabes" for an “increasingly negative tone in politics. “  He said, to an astonished room full or Reporters:     "What happens when Rush Limbaugh attacks those of us in public life is that people aren't satisfied just to listen, They want to act because they get emotionally invested. And so, you know, the threats to those of us in public life go up dramatically, on our families and on us, in a way that's very disconcerting."    Well, let’s examine this. I mean, let’s examine some recent events some recent quotes in then news, some recent usenet quotes, and see where the attacks designed to increase threats are from and whom they are directed at. Let’s see where the unfounded hysteria is really coming from. Let’s look behind the Leftist claims to the real source.   "When you don't vote, you let another church explode. When you don't vote, you allow another cross to burn. When you don't vote, you let another assault wound a brother or sister. When you don't vote, you let the Republicans continue to cut school lunches and Head Start."    Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   Or how about this campaign ad?   "On June 7, 1998 in Texas my father was killed.  He was beaten, chained, and then dragged 3 miles to his death, all because he was black.  So when Governor George W. Bush refused to support hate-crime legislation, it was like my father was killed all over again. Call Governor George W. Bush and tell him to support hate-crime legislation.  We won’t be dragged away from our future."    Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?  Oh, yeah. It’s a real ad, Here’s the link:  http://www.gwu.edu/~action/ads2/adnaacp.html  And, it isn’t like the Democrats didn’t know and approve of what they’ve been doing…. Check the following exchange:   ABC's George Stephanopoulos:  "Well, if it's wrong to play politics with national security, why not call off the scare tactics with Social Security?"   Gephardt:  "I think that's over the line when you get -- get into national security.  Social Security, the economy, jobs are always legitimate political issues and important substantive issues. "  George Stephanopoulos:"You don't think the DNC should take [the ad] down?"   Gephardt:  "I don't."   ----(ABC's "This Week," October 6, 2002)   The comment about national security is of interest, too. When the Democrats started playing politics with our national security, Gephardt at least had the good sense to cut bait.   Liberal Pols are not the only ones cranking up the hysteria in politics.  Remember Harry Belafonte taking to the radiowaves to slam Secretary of State Colin Powell as a sellout to the black race? Belafonte, a guest on San Diego's 760 KFMB, told host Ted Leitner that Powell was like a plantation slave who moves into the slave owner's house and only says what his master wants him to say.  "In the days of slavery, there were those slaves who lived on the plantation and were those slaves that lived in the house. You got the privilege of living in the house if you served the master... exactly the way the master intended to have you serve him.   "Colin Powell's committed to come into the house of the master. When Colin Powell dares to suggest something other than what the master wants to hear, he will be turned back out to pasture."  For close to twenty minutes, Belafonte ripped the entire Bush administration, including an attack on Attorney General John Ashcroft. "There's something wrong with men who think the way Ashcroft does and who manipulate the justice system the way he does."   Belafonte likened Ashcroft's tactics to the McCarthy era:   "Families were destroyed, neighbors spied on neighbors. Now we find Ashcroft cutting in under the guise of catching terrorists, suspending liberties and rights. To deny those rights, to any citizen, to any people, is to cast a great shame on us and lead us back to another dark period."   Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   Or, we can look at Nina Totenburg:  "If there is justice, he will get AIDS, or his grandchilderen will" ---(referring to Jesse Helms)  Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   How about Margaret Carlson?  Linda "Tripp lost membership in the family of man" and "can safely be cast as a villain -- the Mark Fuhrman of the Starr investigation,"   Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to pproject “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   OK, this is all somewhat older stuff. More current you say:… Fine. How about November ’02, in this most recent election;    Candidate debate has unfriendly end 11/24/02 By Bill Walsh Staff writer/The Times-Picayune  BATON ROUGE -- An already-bitter U.S. Senate campaign got personal Saturday afternoon at the conclusion of a taped debate between Democrat Sen. Mary Landrieu and Republican state Elections Commissioner Suzanne Haik Terrell.  After a tense 30-minute segment finished taping at WDSU's studios in New Orleans, the two candidates were preparing to leave. According to witnesses, Landrieu looked over her shoulder and told Terrell, "This is your last campaign."  A stunned Terrell replied, "She threatened me."   Oh, yeah. Nothing inflamitory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   How about Alec Baldwin? Is he still in the country? Remember his big day?   "I'm thinking to myself if we were in other countries, we would, all of us together, all of us together would go down to Washington and we would stone Henry Hyde to death! We would go to their homes, and we'd kill their wives and their children. We would kill their families"   Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?  Or, how about the steamy rethoric of Babs Striesand? Remember her memo to Democrat leaders? She continues to rant, even today.   “And there is a horde of extremist federal judicial nominees, deemed by the Democratically- controlled Senate as too conservative for confirmation, just waiting to get rushed through the nomination process. These judges are guaranteed to threaten our civil liberties, a woman's right to choose, civil rights and environmental protection. And they will be around long after the president is gone.”  Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   Really sad, that one. Such talent. Such a voice. Such an IDIOT.   There’s always Ed Asner…  “I feel that George Bush's actions are desecrating the America that I grew up in and believed in. He is making us an imperialist government. He is choosing to replace heads of state and government he doesn't like.”  Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to pproject “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh? And as an aside, does that mean you DO like Saddam, Ed?  Or how about leftists on the street… literally. Check this from a recent USEnet posting.  “We all need to take a deep breath and think about being a Bush daughter and having that cross to bear. I'd go out and have a couple of drinks, too. - about President George W. Bush's daughters being caught with alcohol as minors  He's embarrassing, he's not my president.

Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   OK, let’s dive back into history, as I happen to find these little gems… One from Hillary Clinton:   "For anybody willing to find it, and write about it, and explain it, is this vast right-wing conspiracy that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he announced for President. A few journalists have kind of caught on to it and explained it, but it has not yet been fully revealed to the American public."  --Jan 27, 1998 Today Show (NBC)   Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   Or, from: http://www.therightwing.com/conspiracy/  “The Vast Right Wing Conspiracy has been outed by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. We can no longer lurk in the shadows. We must show ourselves to the world and reveal for all to see who we are. We have built this page to inform, educate, postulate, and to fight the lies. We have been maligned, slandered and misquoted.

It is propaganda to call a fight against terrorism a war. http://www.angelfire.com/journal2/oreilly-sucks/hitlerbush.htm  Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there.

Just so you have cheap gas for your Tahoe.   Oh, yeah. Nothing inflammatory there, huh? Nothing hysterical, there. Nothing designed to project “a tenor that has led to increased threats on those” who aren’t leftist, eh?   The examples are easy to find there are millions, quite literally. All these quotes I’ve included in this 5 page commentary   are easily verified, and prove beyond a shadow of any doubt:  It is the DEMOCRATS who are the real source of racism and hysteria, the real advocates of violence against political enemies.  It’ll be interesting to watch the cockroaches they are, run for cover when this light is placed on them.

      I discovered back in September of 2000, and thereafter, that writing about current events that are moving quickly is perhaps the hardest chore one can undertake. This has proven true yet again. Events are moving quickly enough that I won't attempt to comment on and cover each point that pops up, in this week's column; there is certainly enough to descuss these events in the next weeks and months.  I am forced to start with events, picked by chance as much as anything else.  As I write this, we have four days of this war under our belt. I find myself watching our people acting in a just cause with no small measure of pride.  Our country is blessed indeed to have such dedicated and talented people.  This Army Photograph  is of a tank and it's crew in Central Iraq, having just driven for the last 32 hours, basicly non-stop. Some of us don't deserve to be served by such people. Who am I talking about?  Who else? The ones who basicly spit in the face of the military every chance they get... the liberals.  One of the interesting aspects of this war is watching the liberals in their discomfort, as their arguments disappear or backfire on them, one by one.  They're begining to understand that they will lose what little credibility they have left when President Bush's path with Iraq turns out to be the right one... and the signs are all there for the seeing. The only ones NOT seeing this, are the losers... the leftists.   See, the left has never understood that winning the hearts and minds of people is of paramount import. In this case, they're just starting to understand that they've already lost, but they fail to fully comprehend WHY.   Let's examine some of the nonsense they've been claiming.  * They can no longer claim this is about oil, since if it was it would have been far more productive to simply put up with Saddam's world-class thuggery. I'm quite sure he'd be more than willing to pump all the oil we wanted, under those conditions.  *  They can't claim, as they have been, that Iraqi citizens are victims of  American force, as we all watch the reaction from the Iraqi people, and watching as they cheer as they see their oppressors fall. Here's a few I've collected, as they've been reported.     Coming into Basra as part of a massive military convoy, I encountered a stream of young men, dressed in what appeared to be Iraqi army uniforms, applauding the US marines as they swept past in tanks."           BBC reporter, 3-22-03       "Ajami Saadoun Khlis, whose son and brother were executed under the Saddam regime,sobbed like a child on the shoulder of the Guardian's Egyptian translator. He mopped the tears but they kept coming. 'You just arrived,' he said. 'You're late. What took you so long? God help you become victorious. I want to say hello to Bush, to shake his hand.  We came out of the grave.'"           The Guadian, 3-22-03           "As hundreds of coalition troops swept in just after dawn, the heartache of a town that felt the hardest edges of Saddam Hussein's rule seemed to burst forth, with villagers running into the streets to celebrate in a kind of grim ecstasy, laughing and weeping in long guttural cries. "‘Oooooo, peace be upon you, peace be upon you, peace you, oooooo,'.  Zahra Khafi, a 68-year-old mother of five, cried to a group of American and British visitors who came to the town shortly after Mr. Hussein's army appeared to melt away. ‘I'm not afraid of Saddam anymore.'"           New York Times, 3-22-03       "We've been driving since dawn today in southern Iraq, and so far we've come across scores of Bedouin herdsmen. We've been greeted by friendly greetings of ‘inshallah' and ‘salaam aleikum'…we've seen both women and men waving greetings and shouting greeting to the U.S. troops."           Radio Free Europe correspondent Ron Synovitz, 3-21-03       "They told me that Saddam Hussein is not allowing anyone to leave Baghdad. I don't fear the Americans. I was in Baghdad in the war in 1991 and I saw how surgical an operation it was. Saddam Hussein has persecuted everyone except his own family. Kurds, Arab Shiites, Turkoman - everybody has suffered. But our country was a rich country and we can be rich again.'"           Financial Times Information, 3-21-03       "These are US Marines being greeted if not with garlands, with hand shakes by residents of the town in the deep-south corner of Iraq."            CBS News, 3-21-03       "One little boy, who had chocolate melted all over his face after a soldier gave him some treats from his ration kit, kept pointing at the sky, saying 'Ameriki,  Ameriki.'"           Associated Press, 3-21-03       "Milling crowds of men and boys watched as the Marines attached ropes on the front of their Jeeps to one portrait and then backed up, peeling the Iraqi leader's black-and-white metal image off a frame. Some locals briefly joined Maj. David 'Bull' Gurfein in a new cheer. 'Iraqis! Iraqis! Iraqis!' Gurfein yelled, pumping his fist in the air... ....A few men  and boys ventured out, putting makeshift white flags on their pickup trucks or waving white T-shirts out truck windows....'Americans very good,' Ali Khemy said. 'Iraq wants to be free. Some chanted, 'Ameriki! Ameriki!' ... "Gurfein playfully traded pats with a disabled man and turned down a dinner invitation from townspeople. 'Friend, friend,' he told them in Arabic learned in the first Gulf War. ..."'No Saddam Hussein!' one young man in headscarf told Gurfein. 'Bush!'"           Associated Press, 3-21-03       "Iraqi citizens were shown 'tearing down a poster of Saddam Hussein' and Dexter Filkins of The New York Times was interviewed, saying that Iraqis he had seen were 'hugging and kissing every American they could find.'"           NBC Nightly News, 3-21-03       "Here was a chance to stop and I clambered down, eager to get a first word from an Iraqi of what he thought of this whole affair. 'As salaam alekum,' I said in the traditional greeting, then ran out of Arabic and quickly added, 'Do you speak English?' No go. But with a fumbled exchange of gestures we slowly managed to communicate. Thumbs up for the American tanks, thumbs down for Saddam Hussein. Then he pointed north into the distance and said 'Baghdad.'"           Reuters, 3-21-03        "A line of dancing Kurdish men, staring directly into the mouth of the Iraqi guns less than a mile away, defiantly burned tires, sang traditional new years songs and chanted, 'Topple Saddam.'..."March 21 is the Kurdish New Year....And bonfires have long been a symbol of  liberation in this part of the world. 'We're celebrating [Nawroz] national holiday,' said Samad Abdulla Rahim, 22. 'But today we also celebrate the attack on Saddam.'..."Many expressed hope that deadly fire would light the night sky over Baghdad in the days ahead, bringing an end to the Kurd's epic 30-year struggle against Hussein and his Baath Party. 'I can't wait for the U.S. planes to come and liberate Kirkuk,' said Shahab Ahmed Sherif, a 33-year-old Kurd who had fled the oil-rich city four days earlier."           Copley News Service, 3-21-03   Unidentified Iraqi man: "Help us live better than this life. Let us have freedom."           ABC World News Tonight, 3-21-03         Hmmm.Given the comments of the Iraqi people, I'd say offhand, that it's a sure bet their hearts and minds are already won over by President Bush's action.  *  Leftists can no longer claim that  the UK and the USA are alone in the thought that our actions are just and right. Indeed, some forty-six countries are publicly committed to the Coalition, including (in Alpha sort)  Afghanistan , Albania , Australia , Azerbaijan , Bulgaria , Colombia ,Costa Rica , Czech Republic, Denmark , Dominican Republic , El Salvador , Eritrea , Estonia , Ethiopia , Georgia , Honduras , Hungary , Iceland , Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, Mongolia, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Palau, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Rwanda, Singapore, Slovakia, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Spain, Turkey, Uganda, United Kingdom, United States, Uzbekistan                                                There are many more who because of fear of reprisals, are not publicly backing this effort but rather are privately   supporting it.  That's who supports our actions. As to who does not support our actions. it should not escape you that the party of big government here in America… the socialist Democrats, along with the Socialist dominated French the left in Canada, the Germans who are socialist dominated now, and have been since the fall of the Berlin wall, the Russians, and many other socialist/leftist groups should want to keep the Iraqi people from this day of liberation… instead keeping them under the thumb of their fellow Socialists in the Baath party. Indeed, all Americans should be angry about it.  American leftists are not, if we can take their louder members as any indication.  *  So, also,  then, they cannot claim being loyal Americans. This by definition includes  Democrat leaders, who, as a result of this action in Iraq, are in full disarray, as well.   Consider the position of Minority Leader Tom Dashiele (D- France). His earlier support of Clinton's attacks on Iraq are now coming back to haunt him. Way back in 98, Daschle said,     "Saddam Hussein leaves us little choice" but "the use of force." He also said, "Iraq must comply (with U.N. resolutions). There is no choice. We stand united in our determination to do whatever is necessary .."     He also called for "immediate Iraqi compliance" or "threat by force" would be "required".   Even more recently, he plays the same tune.    "We ought not politicize this war. We ought not politicize the rhetoric about war and life and death ... We have to rise to a higher level .. It is not too late to forget the pollsters . the campaign fund-raisers . (the) accusations about how interested in national security," different parties are      .."(Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle in the Congressional Record 9/25/02).    So, his well-known recent attacks on President Bush, as regards his efforts in Iraq  are nothing more than the worst kind of partisan politics.   urlLink http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/03/17/sprj.irq.congress.briefing/   And the Democrats seem to be not backing down from this matter, as if they could EVER admit they were wrong… In a recent note to the party faithful, their leadership asks them to stand up for Partisanship over what's right and wrong… Just an hour or two before our beginning to topple Saddam Hussein's regime, the DNC sent e-mails to its grass-roots activists that said "Democratic leaders are standing up to Bush; Make sure you stand up for them!"  The UN must be scratching their collectivist heads, as well, as they watch these reactions… to say nothing of the expressions on their faces as they watch weapons they themselves banned Saddam from having, weapons he swore he didn't have, being launched at our troups, as they liberate Iraq.   You could just feel the red faces as the  world discovered that Iraq does indeed have a downright huge Chem /Bio Weapons plant, near An Najaf, just as we've been saying,  all along.   The poll shows that three-quarters of all Americans approve of the decision to go to war, including 60% who approve strongly. Only one in five Americans disapprove -- 15% who feel strongly and 5% not strongly.   urlLink  Source: http://gallup.com/poll/releases/pr030321.asp   It's interesting how the press has been by and large ignoring this report so far. (Non-partisan press, my butt.)  It's also interesting that the day after this polling data hit the streets, that Daschle and Nancy Pelosi both used their Saturday Radio address to whine about how they are ‘behind the troups'. Here's a link to it;   urlLink http://www.house.gov/pelosi/prSupportTroops032003.htm   This is almost word for word the actual text of the address given, except that Daschle, who can't convincingly read scripting to save himself, was obviously tacked in at the last minute. They clearly gave the impression of two errant dogs being called sternly to heel. Yet they still will not address the concept that when one supports the troups one must also support their actions.. and thereby the choices made by their commanders. If the troups are right in what they do, then so too is their commander… President Bush. making the choices that are right.   These Democrats know no shame whatever, apparently.  The left KNOWS their positions... every one of them, as regards Saddam, and our fight against terrorism, (to say nothing of their draconian domestic policies) are the wrong ones for America, and for the world. They KNOW their constant whining about President Bush and his leadership is costing them votes, particularly when Bush demonstrably keeps making the right choices, over their loud objections, which would have us doing exactly the wrong thing. The numbers above, suggest that the American people, as a rule, are wise to this, however much TV coverage the anti-war rioters get.   I, for one, plan to never let the left forget they stood up to be counted among those who opposed the US... the troops our President and the freedom of the Iraqi people. I hope you don't either. But, for the rest of the world, our hearts and minds have been won by the people who have the courage to fight for what's right.  Let us also not forget who it was who put us into this position of having to fight in the first place:. Think back a few years, to 1992. Who was it who told us all that he had little interest in foreign policy, and was therefore better qualified to run for President? Why, Bill Clinton, of course.  With all of this said, I will make the suggestion that you offer a prayer for our servicepeople. They know better than anyone else what we're up against. They don't think their sacrafice a vain or idle one.   But, I hasten to add,  the left does. Consider it this way: How can one claim, as the left has with some consistancy, that Mr. Bush is a war criminal, without labeling the military war criminals as well?   Perhaps that's one more claim the left can no longer make; that they support our soldiers.

      We are so often told by the news media and the left (Often a redundancy) that there is no left leaning bias within our fifth estate.  And certainly, they are honest, and do not spread mistruths for some advantage.  It's gotten to the point where it's become a large joke.  Well, the usual left-leaning suspects in the news world... CNN, the New York Times, and a few others, have all within the last few weeks, admitted to years of lying to us. Not just once... they admit readily they lied for decades, about conditions in Iraq under Saddam Hussein.  Yep. You may not have heard this one. You can understand why they'd be reluctant to tell us...  Indeed the usual leftists have been verrrrry quiet about this one. But apparently CNN’s chief news executive, Eason Jordan felt the need to unburden his soul, and has reported in an editorial in the TIMES that under his direction CNN  purposely failed to report Iraqi atrocities. While Jordan claims he was protecting his staff, a lot of people, journalists particularly, have questions and concerns that CNN was trading their lies for access. Ok, either way that swings, there's a number of major concerns.    Let’s ignore for just a second, the questions of Jordan's motivation (and there are several) to get this point out; the biggest role these news orgs have is being a watchdog, supposedly. We keep getting told this when they’re trying to attack… errr.. report on someone who isn’t leftist/socialist.  Assuming they are being true to their charter, the only action journalists can take against oppression, injustice and hate is by exposing it thereby forcing a reaction from the rest of us.   In short, their job is to REPORT.  CNN didn't.  If nothing else, CNN should have put up a disclaimer to tell viewers that the Iraqi government was controlling the actions of reporters, and thereby controlling the content of their reports to us. No, we were expected to take what they fed us as hard news.... that we were getting the real picture of what was what in Iraq. In short, CNN lied.   CNN, being the only really world news body, had a monopoly on the picture of Iraq being fed the world. And the world got ONLY what Saddam wanted us to see, without so much as a whimper of protest from a CNN that, were they being stonewalled in a non-socialist country, would have been raising world-wide hell.  As to what impact all this has had, nobody can really be sure.  One can only, in this situation, properly  gauge all the implications by saying "what if"...  What impact on the U.N. debate of last winter might there have been, had CNN actually maintained that much touted watchdog role?  Can you imagine the reaction, both here and abroad,  had CNN actually reported then, as they did after the fact, in Eason’s words, that several Iraqi officials had told CNN that  “Saddam Hussein was a maniac who had to be removed”? Imagine the reaction of the much misunderstood Arab Street, had the news come out that Saddam’s son had planned to kill the King Of Jordan, as CNN now admits... Imagine  the reaction of the American public, for that matter. Do you think the leftist arguments against our removing Saddam would have gained even as much traction as they managed to? And finally consider the difference in the UN debates on the issue.  In their failure to report the gross human-rights violations by Saddam, and all the other damning information that should have been reported, CNN has systematically ignored that watchdog role. One wonders what would cause them to so dramatically shift from the traditional watchdog policy to looking remarkably like Bill Clinton’s “don’t ask, don’t tell”.  One also wonders if they were selling their silence for access, and what possible reason there could be for that; what purpose their silence could possibly have served. Certainly, it wasn't helpful in getting the truth out to the people. The price for their controlled access was that they became a part of the Human-rights violation conspiracy that was Saddam’s government. Is this the same CNN that fought so hard against government officials they saw as less than desirable on this side of the ocean? Something simply doesn't add up here. Perhaps a look at their other actions will give us a clue as to what was what.  In looking around the landscape on this topic, some things do leap right out.  Let's remember, this is the same news org that paid 30,000 dollars US for video tapes... videotapes that depict al-Qaida poison gas experiments, terror training and bomb-making, and then lied about that, blaiming a 'miscommunication' for the discrepancy. The Tapes, initially, were a feather in the cap for CNN, who made several nights of programming out of them. Fox news never covered those tapes. Their news exec, Kevin MacGee, explained it this way:  "we don't see much newsworthy in it," said Kevin Magee, Fox's vice president of programming. "You've got to be careful when you start paying for things"  CNN at that time, refused to identify its source for the tapes but to this day insists its money did not go to Osama bin Laden or his terrorist organization.  Fox's Magee says, however... "We are at war. This is the enemy. Where did the money go? I'm not sure `trust us' is good enough."  No kidding, Kevin, particularly in light of Eason's overlate admissions.  I’ve mentioned the Times and CNN, in particular because both these orgs were rather outspoken in their opposition to out invasion of Iraq.  One wonders, though, just why... why they were so adamant about our not deposing Saddam., given the horrible facts they now admit to us that they did know, and what they're not admitting to us, like where those tapes came from.   Gee... do you suppose.... could it be that Saddam was a fellow leftist..... being a founding member of the Socialist Baath party? Was this opposition just one more lie to be told to maintain their position in Iraq?   And, perhaps an even more frightening question: What else has CNN not told us about it’s leftist/socialist friends around the world? Like the aforementioned Bill Clinton, as an example.   Even assuming their motivations were not, as I suspect they were, Geo-political... the only option left here is that CNN was running a straight propaganda service for Saddam and his merry band of thugs. This is balanced news?  CNN has an undeniable effect on the other news orgs around the world. How much did their not reporting such matters, influence the other news orgs into thinking nothing was wrong?  Or, perhaps more seriously; how many others were following where CNN led, and were as a result unwittingly lying to us, and to what effect?

      There are two levels of hate being sent from the left, these days at Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair. They are both fairly easy to identify, and understand. These two levels and a mixture of them, are being send by two groups: The leftist followers, and the leftist leaders.  The first grouping, is by far the less sinister, but still problematic: The followers. There is an unspoken truth, that those who bring uncomfortable truths into our lives are often regarded with some degree of hate, by those unwilling to face those realities. So it is with Mister Blair, and with Mr. Bush, in these days of post-war Iraq.   They have reminded us that the price of peace, is having to defeat evil, by whatever means, including the force of arms, occasionally. The idea of the ability to live under peace, and all the benefits thereof, for extended periods is a recent luxury in the history of the world, a luxury which was brought on, not by simply being "peaceful" but by such as were willing to *fight* to defeat evil, thus bringing about such extended peace.  There are some who are uncomfortable with that great truth and who have deluded themselves into the misbegotten idea that all one needs to have peace is to be 'peaceful'... forgetting that we're only half of the equation.. and that all a war needs is one antagonist. From these peace loving, supposedly open minded people, we see a lot of unreasoning vitriol... downright hate... being directed at those doing the correcting.  There is much in the leftist agenda, that is childlike... meaning both the good and the bad implications of this label.... Alas, that the good sides of that childlike aspect get lost in the reality! In this instance as in most others, the deluded leftists respond like any child who has been corrected sternly by reality... with an unreasoning "IdonWANNA...". And, to extend the metaphor, the child will come up with ANY argument possible just to hold up his end against the adult's logic, particularly if the child doesn't understand the parent's logic in the least. Indeed, they tend not to understand even their own limited logic, (and therefore offer lame arguments for it, and then only when pressed) but rather tend to follow blindly whomever is speaking the loudest from their camp, who end up usually being from the second grouping.  This second grouping, and by far, the more sinister of the kinds of hate flowing toward Mr's Bush and Blair, are the people who are about supporting the evil which we just fought. I've pointed out repeatedly, that what we're up against is simply another branch of socialism. I consider it no shock, therefore, that there would be leftists here at home who would not want to see the downfall of the leader of the socialist Baath party and his minions.  Now that such a corrupt leadership is gone, and the socialists here in the west are feeling rather naked, they tend to respond like any cornered animal would... napping and snarling, this is the most hate filled and vitriolic leftist. This feeling of embarrassment is further amplified as Castro executes some more dissidents, and as the hell that the socialists have made of North Korea comes to light...(and as Mr Bush calls that errant dog to heel) ...and as all the other disasters predicted by the left fail to materialize. The reaction of these hard-line socialists to this is understandable, but none the less is ironic; since this most hateful type most often constitutes what passes as the collective leadership of the "peace" movement. (Note: "Collective" here, is not an idle choice of words).  It is this second group that the first grouping follows, often quite blindly. Sad, because there is much to be said for the child-like innocence that the first group offers... Innocence that the second group exploits for their own purposes. Consider that "Socialist World Workers Party, World Wide A.N.S.W.E.R., and so on, the groups that are behind so many of the anti-war protests of today, are being funded directly by places like North Korea, and you begin to see the depth of that exploitation.  The radio and TV talk shows, (at least the ones that still cater to leftists) and Usenet are both and each a microcosm of both of these kinds such hatreds; filled with such levels of leftist vitriol that it's hard not be imagine a rabid dog in it's death throes, snapping at anything and everything it can, even imagined targets, and hoping that few will be infected by him before he's put out of our collective misery, so that the world's occupants can continue to evolve.   But underneath all the vitriol being directed at Mr Bush and his supporters...which means 75% of Americans... one senses the uneasiness of both of our groups. There is a division in the left today, as the second grouping begins to come to grips with how it has been manipulated for decades by the first.... since the Vietnam era, and before.  Consider a few examples of the more obvious splits:  *Degenova at Columbia and many others like him, forsaking the "Anti-War" moniker in favor of calling for open warfare, and the defeat of America. Turns out they're pro-war after all. It's, just that they're on the other side, and seemingly always have been.   *NOW expressing outrage that Lacy Peterson's Killer should be charged with a double murder because the second involves an unborn boy named "Conner". After decades of supposedly fighting to protect women, this seems to fly in the face of their stated purpose, to guard their real purpose... promotion of abortion. Even within their own ranks, they're split on handling that one.... the far leftists in NOW leadership are clearly getting a message from the rank and file.  * Robbins, Sarandon, Mike Farrel, the Ditsy Chumps, to name but a few leftists collectively scream (falsely) about how their 'free speech rights' were violated, and that the right is out of line for questioning the patriotism and morality of such people. Well hold on, here. Aren't these the same leftists who just went after Rick Santorum, and Trent Lott before him, for using THEIR free speech rights, in the process questioning their patriotism and their morality? And this double standard is nothing new...  For a number of years, now, the left's attacks on the right have been categorical and personal. Conservatives have been labeled as reactionary, and liberals have been labeled as progressive. In this, the left has managed to covey the notion that conservatives, by the nature of their POV are moral inferiors. Ummmm this isn't attacking our patriotism and morality? And isn't this the same left who a short time ago was even questioning the very concepts of morality, and of patriotism?  The true purposes of the leftist leadership is being revealed in each of these cases...and the followers, if they are not recoiling in horror, are quietly questioning if *this* was what they really wanted. And given the polling numbers showing wild support for both our action in Iraq and for the President, and his policies, it would seem that a goodly chunk of them are being less than fully quiet in their questioning, and in their conclusions.  It's to the point now, where America is united as it has not been since Reagan... indeed since FDR, truth be told. The vast majority of Americans, for the first time in over a decade, are quite sure that their country and the leadership thereof is doing the right thing as regards it's own role in the world. As the successes of  this path of action and thereby the support for it, continue to pile up, and the evidence against the socialist mantra continues to accumulate, the left, is now finding itself increasingly irrelevant. That, in turn, drives those remaining in the camp of the left, to even more vitriol, more over-the-top attacks, more grandstand ploys, and more desperate (and easier to defeat) arguments. In short.. deeper into hate. And that hate, as hate always does, tends to feed on itself.  Both Mr Bush and Mr Blair have some tough times ahead as a result of all of this, I think. Their task: Keeping the left isolated and irrelevant; To keep the terminally hateful left from infecting the rest of us. Hate, after all, has a way of spreading as the history of every socialist country in history attests... Nazi Germany,  Stalin's Soviet Union, Castro's Cuba,  Saddam's Iraq. But both the President and the Prime Minister have shown themselves to be a rarity in these times.... true leaders, and up to the tasks before them.   To prove that point... and to defeat yet another liberal argument that we've forgotten the war on terrorism....one needs only look at reports just out today,  that as a result of their actions, terrorism, as measured by the number of terrorist attacks, is down by 44% which puts it at it's lowest since we started measuring such attacks back in 1969.  And that's as hopeful a sign as the western world has had in many years!  But it will doubtless cause even more hate from the left. Ya know, after a while, you have to ask, just what it is the left wants? Are these results not desireable to them?

      --Rochester, NY---  I wrote a few weeks ago about how CNN had lied to us. Since that time, two more similar points have come to light.  Former ANBC newsgeek Peter Coluins is now telling us that Peter Jennings, the Anchor edited stories to put a better spin on the outlook of the Sandanistas.   urlLink http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewNation.asp?Page=\Nation\archive\200305\NAT20030501c.html    After the revelations of CNN lying to us about another group of socialists, Saddam and Company, this should come as no shock, even assuming you knew nothing about Daniel Ortega. Just one more example of how the leftist dominated press has been lying to us. But, of course, there’s more. MUCH more.  You will recall that mentioned prominently in the piece of last week, was the New York Times.  The case against ex-Times employee Jayson Blair is heating up at this point, and all the facts aren’t in… this is written based on the facts we know so far.  I advise you to read up on this subject… I won’t waste your bandwidth repeating it here, except in very brief:  Blair has been found to have been writing about things that didn’t happen and other associated charges, all raising questions about the validity of his stories.   I’d been watching this business with Blair, for several weeks. I’ve always suspected that Blair wasn’t the only problem, and that his situation was revealing of a systemic issue within the paper, but also of the so-called “mainstream”  newsgathering in this country.  Now, I said last week that this would be a column on the left playing the race card. I said that because the Blair case certainly looked like it was developing into that.  As the facts have developed since last week, however, it’s become more than that.   Was race an issue? A US news online poll certainly seems to suggest it was; around 75% answered that Blair got away with it because he was a rising-star minority. More than this, Andrew Sullivan has Times executive editor, Howell Raines, saying to his staff at an internal meeting, the other day:    “Our paper has a commitment to diversity and by all accounts [Blair] appeared to be a promising young minority reporter,” Mr. Raines said. “I believe in aggressively providing hiring and career opportunities for minorities.” “Does that mean I personally favored Jayson?” he added, a moment later. “Not consciously. But you have a right to ask if I, as a white man from Alabama, with those convictions, gave him one chance too many by not stopping his appointment to the sniper team. When I look into my heart for the truth of that, the answer is yes.”    Raines, of course is being only partially truthful, here. Reports and internal Times documents have surfaced that suggest MANY different managers tried to have Blair removed from writing for the Times. Blair remained. Why?  Of COURSE race was part of the issue.  And this incident does seem to be directly in line with the fears expressed by those who object to ‘affirmative action’.  But race was only a part of the issue, and I expect this statement of Raines is a play of the most cynical kind.   Raines knows that most of his core is liberal. So, the admission, coated with “But Ma, I did it to help that poor black man” will, Raines thinks, go down much easier. Yet, this while this admission will strike sympathy in the breasts of many liberals, the fact is it makes a victim of Mr. Blair.  Says Brent Bozell:    "But it’s clear that Blair’s meteoric rise – a young man who didn’t even graduate from the University of Maryland, from humble internships to the national desk in four years – was not following the average career trajectory of an American reporter. Many journalists work their whole lives dreaming of someday joining the New York Times. It’s time to ask whether Blair would have ever been promoted into the position where he caused maximum damage if race wasn’t a factor in his career."     Blair as usual got a pass on all the transgressions for one reason only; He was black and was thus immune to the rules. Black Columnist Thomas Sowell seems to agree:    "Having gotten away with so much, Blair knew that the rules and standards that applied to others would not be applied to him because he represented “diversity.” He just pushed it a little farther than it would go."     This whole incident seems to me emblematic for what happens when liberals have their say in issues of racial ‘diversity’. That said, though, there’s a deeper and more urgent issue, here. I doubt we can hang the credibility of the Times, or the current lack thereof, on Howell Raines alone. Nor can race be the sole issue here as the management of the Times seems to imply in their dissembling.  Granted, that race and the headlong rush of the left for what is laughably called “diversity”, before it’s even properly defined, is a large bit of the puzzle.   However, race is part of this Blair business, only insofar as the liberal’s mantra crosses racial issues. In short, racial diversity as a goal is a mere excuse for what was really afoot; Liberal bias. Yes, mistakes will happen. This sort of complete collapse however requires a systemic pattern. It is a bias that’s been festering for years before John Corry exposed it in his book “My Times”.  To get some measurement of this bias, let’s look at Raines.  Back in 94, puked up this hairball:    “Reagan couldn’t tie his shoelaces if his life depended on it.”    Oh, yeah. Really unbiased, this one. While the rest of the press had real news to deal with, the Times gleefully ignored the real world, and focused all of its energy and righteous indignation instead, on induced Raines screeds against Augusta National Golf club and it’s policy regards women players.  Remember, now, this is the same Raines who back on 1998, when he was the editorial page editor, wrote and posted a column, going after the Boston Globe's editors... ironicly, the Globe being a Times owned paper... for saving the  ass of then Globe columnist Mike Barnicle. He said at the time:      "Public respect for newspapering is wounded when rules that would be enforced with doctrinal ferocity among the  mass of journalists are lightened for a star who has great  value to the paper. If you believe, as I do, that if you have to choose between a worthy but erring colleague and the newspaper itself, you choose for the paper."     Clearly, Raines in this case held something higher than the paper on this round : liberal politics. Under his liberal leaning “leadership” what is the staff, in turn doing? Exactly what’s apparently expected of them: Tilting to the left. Consider the case of Times columnist Maureen Dowd, where she misquotes President Bush:  Busy chasing off Saddam, the president and vice president had told us that Al Qaeda was spent. “Al Qaeda is on the run,” President Bush said last week. “That group of terrorists who attacked our country is slowly but surely being decimated... They’re not a problem anymore.”   Now, here’s the entire quote, including the words Dowd removed, and the Times allowed her to remove:    “ Al Qaeda is on the run. That group of terrorists who attacked our country is slowly, but surely being decimated. Right now, about half of all the top al Qaeda operatives are either jailed or dead. In either case, they’re not a problem anymore.”    Notice the difference? In what Dowd posted, it’s clear she’d like us to think that the President is of the impression that al Qaeda isn’t a problem anymore.  Of course he didn’t say, or mean that, but the Times didn’t tell us that.  The thread in each of these is the same… a liberal bias, within the Times, that was fed from the top.   I’m not surprised that I’ve been unable to dig up much of Jayson Blair’s output to his regular column in the op-ed pages. But can it be that Raines turned a blind eye to his transgressions because they liked his political stand on things, as they have always seemed to like Doud’s political leanings?  Consider the overtly leftist stand of the paper as regards the war in Iraq.  We were told repeatedly how the war would be a quagmire, and that it would isolate us in the Arab world. To show how wrong that ‘news’ was, let’s check the op-ed pages in the Arab News:    urlLink http://www.arabnews.com/Article.asp?ID=26165     “There is much in US policy to condemn; there are many aspects of Western society that offend and where necessary, Arab governments condemn. But anti-Americanism and anti-Westernism for their own sake are crude, ignorant and destructive. They create hate. They must end. Otherwise there will be more barbarities.”     Hmmm.  Since the leftists running the Times proven so wrong, perhaps we’ll hear soon about how Blair wrote all those anti-war screeds, too, huh?  Look, let’s give them some credit, since it’s due: I applaud the public examinations the Times has engaged in thusfar.  However, they do not go far enough, and so far, they expend too much effort on protecting the guilty… protecting the leadership of the Times,  and I’m not just talking about Blair.  Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger argued that Blair was the only one to blame, here, of course.    “The person who did this is Jayson Blair. Let’s not begin to demonize our executives—either the desk editors, or the executive editor or, dare I say, the publisher.”    In other words, Raines is saying that finding out who did what and exposing those faults is "scapegoating', at least when Times Managers are focused on.  Think about this. Let’s say that a major oil company is found to be lying to the public. Would the media, the Times particularly be all over it?  Why is the management of the Times exempt from level of scrutiny, this level of acid, about it’s own transgressions? The answer of course is that any snake is immune to it’s own venom.   Let’s see… ABC, CBS CNN, and now the Times have all been caught tilting stories to the left. And this is just what they’ve been publicly caught at. Lord knows what they've NOT been caught at. But the Smart Americans have known all along.  And Liberals simply can’t understand why Fox News is doing so well. (Chuckle!)

      It must really be a pain to be a liberal these days... Every single issue the left has tried to spring on the rest of us, is exposed as flat out lies, or at least, a tretching of what little substance they manage to find. Consider a just few examples from the last few weeks:   Originaly, the left started hollering about the looting going on in Iraq, and remained gleefully ignorant of the reports that suggested such looting was limited to government offices and places associated with Saddam's regime. Apparently unable to gather any sympathy for their aguments about looters in Baghdad, (particularly after seeing little wrong about looters in LA) they have latched onto what they think is an easir argument. The left started screaming that our  forces, under the supposed misdirection of George W Bush, had failed to protect the Iraqi museums. Supposedly, tens of thousands of items were looted.   Only one problem with the story: It's a flat-out lie spread by Democrats desperate to put a chink in the armor of President George W. Bush.   Col. Matthew F. Bogdanos, a Marine reservist who is investigating the looting and is stationed at the museum, reports that museum officials had given him a list of 29 artifacts that were definitely missing. But even of those, four of them - ivory objects from the eighth century BC - had been traced. “Twenty-five pieces is not the  same as 170,000,” said Colonel Bogdanos, who in civilian life is an assistant Manhattan district attorney. The most vauable artifact was a Bowl, says a Chicago Tribune article. The rest of what was suppsoedly looted, was found, right where it was suposed to be. And in case you’ve not heard, our forces also happened to have found a Iraqi gunner’s nest.... inside the museum.   Well, heck, they were only off by 169,975 objects out of a set of 170,000... Between this glaring screwup, and the little reminder last week by some of the right, that we couldn’t even get the left to admit there was soemthing wrong with looting, during the LA riots...that it was merely a sign of the frustration the looters had with their government... and weren't the Iraqis entiutled to be frustrated with the socialists that had been running things in Iraq... Well... I’ll wililng to bet that we don’t hear much more about looting from the American left, for a while.   Do Democrats really think this nonsense is going to get them back into power?   * Running for President   Then there's the laughter surrounding the leaders in the Democrat race for the office of President. Did you see the ‘great debate’ the other night? Well, most people didn’t, and they didn’t miss much, if facts were what you were after. It WAS good comedy, though. It was on at around 2am here in Rochester, and I’m unaware of anyone doing it live, but I did manage to grab it on tape. I have to say...it was a  real hoot.   For one thing, I hope I was not alone when I noticed an interesting point: While all of the candidates were quite loud in their attacks on President Bush with regards to the economy, the only solution they managed to offer was to eliminate the tax cuts, which are the ONLY thing now that will actually HELP the economy. Nobody offered any solution OTHER than increased taxes. Nobody made any mention of what THEIR economic plan would be, past that one point. No, not one. What inspirations these Democrats are!   Oh, I suppose it should be mentioned also, that they mentioned their manic devition to socialist healthcare, though of course they'd never call it that. All of the plans offered as regards healthcare are expensive to well past the point of insanity and impossible to judge based on the fantasy numbers provided. But they do offer the Democrats the one thing they crave most: Government Control. It's the reason they can't leave healthcare alone... they want more control over our  lives, and dependant on them.   Do Democrats really think this nonsense is going to get them back into power?   * Judical nominees.   We have seen two appointments now where the democrats have been very loud about the appointment being fillibustered. This is unusual in itself, but even more so because this is the first time such a fillibuster has taken place, for appeals court justice appointees, of all things. Both of the candidates being stalled would pass by a majority vote if allowed. And such a vote is all that the Constitution requires. However, the DNC is desperate to oppose the president, the  Congressional majority AADN the will of the people, to say nothing of the Constitution itself, for their own political gain.   The good news for America and bad news for the socialist Democrats, is that the Republcians have found a way around this blockage.The parliamentary committee will rule that such blocks do not fall within the scope of fillibuster allowances. There will, of course, be loud Socialist Democrat objection to such a ruling. However, that ruling can stand by a simple majority vote, which the supporters of Estrada and Owens have. Which would start the appointment process again.   Which means the nominees get their jobs, because there are enogh votes to do so.   The Democrats of course seening that the Republican action would be legal, constitutional and ethical, and would end their obstruction, is now saying that such a ruling would cause them to start blocking every legislative action in congress.   Yes, indeed, The Democrats, are showing themselves to be what they have always been... the party of obstruction. I ask again...   Do Democrats really think this nonsense is going to get them back into power?    *Iraq.   Democrats, seeing that all the dire predictions they made about the war in Iraq and seeing the election cycle coming, find themselves in a pickle. The ones not running for office are in mourning, and amusingly so. The ones who are running for office, are also running for the cover of what they think are the American people's short memories. It's usually called a flip-flop. It's also called hypocrisy.   It's something of a bad joke that the strongest showing was from Joe Lieberman, last year's loser in the VP race. At the moment, he's the front runner. Nobody else comes close.   Another flip-flop is yet another candidate for the Democrat nomination, Former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean. He's been a busy little boy making lots of whose loud opposition to the Iraq action made lots of points with the wacko left... saying among other things that Iraq was "the wrong war at the wrong time" and publicly doubting whether the Iraqi people were better off with Saddam gone. Dean has, with the onset of reality, changed his tune. During the 'big debate" ... just one week after being attacked by campaign officials for Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, his chief rival, who called him as unfit to be commander in chief, Mr. Dean dropped his fierce antiwar rhetoric and said he was "delighted to see Saddam Hussein gone."   Kerry himself, of course is no exception. Kerry, you may recall, voted for the congressional war resolution but continually made leftist political hay by criticizing Mr. Bush for not gathering more international support. Once realiy set it, Kerry shifted his position. Otherwise known as a flip-flop. Kerry needed a toughened image on national security. So, he had his chief spokesman, Chris Lehane,  attack Mr. Dean for suggesting that the United States would not always be the strongest military power in the world. And of course Kerry is having his middle name canged to "Served in Vietnam."   Then there's Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota, who had in the past denounced Mr. Bush for failing "miserably" to find a diplomatic solution to avoid a war with Iraq, gives the president "great credit" for his leadership in winning the war. Well, turns out all the dire predictions didn't come true, and lookie, lookie... Daschle, who faces re-election next year in a state where Mr. Bush is popular, calls the war necessary and justified.... basicly abandoning  his antiwar rhetoric. Says Daschle:   "I don't think there's any more justification required than what we've  already seen in terms of the purpose of the military operations.  Regime change was a legitimate goal, was accomplished, and I think  that's laudable in and of its own right."    Says RNC strategist Ed Gillespie"   "The dilemma they have is that there is an energetic and large  element in the Democratic Party that remains against the war. But the  vast majority of voters, including many Democrats, support and  appreciate the skill with which it was executed and the firmness of  the president in deciding what to do. Bush had the foresight to do  what is necessary in the war with Iraq, and now you have those who  want to challenge him belatedly and begrudgingly follow him to that  same conclusion,"   Jim Dyke, who is a spokesperson for the RNC agrees:   "Some of these guys are beginning to contradict their contradictions.  At some point, it becomes extremely difficult to discern exactly what  they stand for," said Jim Dyke, chief spokesman for the Republican  National Committee.    * Bush is a President whom the military respects.   We're seeing a lot of wailing and gnashing of teeth on the left over President Bush's trip out to the carrier Lincoln. It interests me that so many are having such problems with the concept of the president personally thanking his troups for a job well done. Robert "KKK" Byrd is the loudest, and we'll deal with that, but he's not alone in his idiocy. All the excuses to attack the President came out at once.   They tried, for example to tell us that the ship was turning circles waiting for the President, and that the Sailors were delayed in getting home by this action of the President. Of course, the truth came out... the ship was ahead of scedule and COULDN'T dock until the scheduled time because of union workers at the dock, and other arrangements. They tried cost factors as a complaint. So then someone  reminded them that that the jet and the chopper others would have taken, use the same fuel, and have fairly well the same costs per mile.   All the complaints of the Democrats on this did, was to show how irrelevant, petty, and opportunistic the Democrats really are.   The capper, though, was when they started making noise about using the Military for political purposes, at which point someone came up with this picture of Bubba on the TeddyR, on March the 12th, 1993. just before sending them to Bosnia. There have been other pictures and trips during the Clinton administration, too... the usually timid Tim Russert came up with one this morning, from about a year after this photo was taken. The resuilting contrast between the silence from the left, and the laughter of the rest of us on this double standard, is palpable. And isn't it odd, how CNN,, CBS and ABC and most of the print media have said nothing about this?    And I wonder why we heard no complaints from Grand Wizard Byrd about the several Military photo-ops Bubba put together... to say nothing of the remainder of the list of idiots complaining about President Bush. For that matter, where are the usual suspects on Ueenet as regards this double standard?    How much did puting a 77 year old Democrat into pace as a payoff cost America? And of course, let's remember the trip into space by John Glenn, which was clearly a payoff for defending Bubba from his crimes. I don't recall any questions about what THAT cost, do you?   How many of these things need to be pointed up before liberals understand that we've caught on to all the doubletalk and just plain BS they've been feeding us? Do Democrats really think continuing this nonsense is going to get them back into power?    The real bottom line though is that the Democrats are ticked off for one reason, and one reason only; THey're out of power, and aree desperate to get back INTO power. They're ticked because they see clearly that the American people liked the idea of Bush's landing there, and personally thanking the troops. In short, what Bush did, *worked*, and they're trying to find some way to negate the fact that  it DID work.... and didn't work for Bubba.... as it didn't work for Mike Dukakas. The reason is simple; nobody accpted that the interest and trust of Bubbam dbnd Dikakas, in things military was genuine... everyone thought... no... everyone, including the far left rank and file... KNEW they were liars on the subject.   Not so with Mr. Bush. His trust of the military and they of him, is easily seen, and hard to argue with, and harder to campaign against. Anyone who saw both the Visit by Presidents Bush and Bubba, can see that there is a warmth and comradery between the Military and President Bush that simply wasn't there with bubba.... which, given his history, who can blame them? And the poeple trust the opinion of  the Military, given that they're the ones charged with defending us. They know what will best accomplish that. Their relative opinions of each is well known... which of course is why the Democrats tried to negate the votes of those in the Military in the 2000 election.   So, thus does the Democrat's worst nightmare come true. Not only have the American seen the Democrats exposed as the liars, cheats and outright frauds that they are, they've reached a point where the majority won't put up with it any longer. As the next election will clearly demonstrate.    And lest you think I'm stretching the matter; consider that internal memos floating around inside the DNC within the last month are suggsting the Democrats are planning on losing at least 4 seats in the Senate, and another 3 in the House. Which also suggests they know they haven't a prayer for the White House.    And all of this without even touching the issue of Democrats playing the race card... which is interesting in itself. Barring major events, we'll discuss that next time.

      In case you haven't heard this...Howell Raines and Gerald Boyd are out at the New York Times.   Apparently, Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. is listening to the feedback he’s getting, not only from his own people, but also from mainstream America, and not liking what he’s hearing about his paper. In recent weeks, I called for, and fully expected the head of Howell Raines.  What I did NOT expect, and perhaps should have, was that of Gerald Boyd, as well.   What you shouldn’t let yourself get sucked in by, is all this chatter about Jayson Blair being the cause of all these problems at the Times, and by extension, in the rest of the country's press, as well. Blair seems to be buying into the idea it’s his fault. As word of the firings of the Raines and Boyd became Public, New York City's Channel 2 interviewers asked Blair for comments. He responded with:     “I'm truly sorry for my actions and what they have done," said Blair. "I feel like, you know, I was in a cycle of self-destruction, but I never intend, and I never intended to hurt anyone else. And the pain that I have caused my colleagues, I'm sorry. The pain for my family and friends and anybody else."    As much as the news media in general, and the Times in particular, as well as Blair himself, have tried to portray all these events this as the Jayson Blair Soap opera, don’t you believe it. As I have said before, all this makes Blair a victim… a point apparently not lost on Blair… he almost selfishly attempts to take center stage for the whole affair… Being a victim, of course, is something that always seems to resonate with the left.  His victim- status- seeking not  withstanding, however… these events can by no stretch of the wildest imagination be left at the feet of Jason Blair.  Blair was never the central issue, nor even the majority of the issue… Blair was merely the last straw, in a long string of leftist excesses that The Times and it’s companies have become infamous for.  As Sullivan said recently:    “Crusading stories were covered exhaustively in what became known as a Rainesian “flood-the-zone” trademark. Its newest columnists engaged in increasingly reckless left-wing screeds; its op-ed pages saw conservative voices purged; and dozens of staffers started to leave for other papers. Those who criticized the new direction were punished or pushed out.   (Full disclosure: after I started criticizing the paper’s slanted coverage of polls and the Enron scandal, my six-year contract with the Times magazine was ended at Raines’ behest.)  Errors mounted; and the corrections pages grew. Instead of the staid hierarchy of the past, Raines picked out loyalists for promotion and demoted others. Young new stars shot ahead, while long-standing reporters and editors steamed.   In one particularly bizarre period, Raines decided to make a cause out of shaming the Augusta National Golf Club to admit women. This somewhat minor story was pursued on the front pages with a passion that bordered on crankdom. And when two columnists dared to write pieces defending Augusta, they found their columns spiked by Raines. He was later forced to reinstate them. But fear and loathing of Raines grew in the newsroom; while his own favorites took more and more liberties with the truth.”     As I’ve suggested before, these were not liberties, at least in terms of what the boss wanted… they were simply following the directions set by the leftist Raines. Blair, truth be told,  is merely a convenient escape from the truth of the matter… something to blame all of this on. Blair, who seemingly will take the spotlight any way he can get it, is willing to play the game served up for him by his liberal masters.  One wonders if the re-appointment of Joseph Lelyveld, who retired a few years ago to make way for Raines, will do anything to regain the image of the paper. Given the connection alluded to in my recent columns between the Times and the press in the rest of the country, these questions extend to the remainder of the press as well.  As Brent Bozell says:  “Now that Mr. Raines and Mr. Boyd have resigned, Publisher Arthur Sulzberger, Jr. has a crucial decision to make. He can either continue to use the Times to promote an arrogant, left-wing advocacy agenda or he can return to the news. “The New York Times’ return to respectability is dependent upon whether it presents the news in an accurate, evenhanded manner. ‘All the news that’s fit to print’ is meaningless if the reporting is skewed to promote a liberal agenda.  Mr. Sulzberger has an opportunity to start afresh with new editors, and we hope he takes full advantage of it.”   I’ll be watching, but, frankly, I’m not overly hopeful, here.  Raines was part of the problem, granted… as too was his crony, Boyd. I can see, even, an argument suggesting that Lelyveld is a solution to the problem.  However, unlike the defenders of the Times, (and for that matter, the Times itself)  let’s be honest, here.  Sulzberger himself is the biggest problem, and that situation doesn’t look to change very soon. Sulzberger has always held the conviction that journalism is about helping people and building what they consider a better society.  If you think this isn’t the prevailing nonsense in the news world today, ask anyone coming out of journalism schools why THEY’RE doing what they’re doing, and they’ll tell you ‘to make a difference’, not to "report the news". Simply and fairly reporting the news, and perhaps offering an even-handed comment on it, is too dull an assignment, for those on this ‘great mission’.  Once again, the Times shows up as the largest example of this kind of bias inducement. This is not something that’s just cropped up since Raines took over the ummm... errr…… reins. (Yeah, I know... sorry)  To give you an idea how prevailing this bias is, try this one: Ever notice how it used to be ‘newsman’, and now it’s “journalist”?  The Times has been at the lead of that ill-advised rush away from "newsman'.  Why is this important? Time to refer to my trusty 1956 edition of Barnhart’s dictionary….    ”Newsman” is listed as : “A man who gathers, reports, or edits news”; Journalist is listed as someone who keeps a journal, whereas a journal is listed as “The writings of what someone sees or thinks.” A subtle change, but enough of one to allow for partisanship without the overt appearance of it. Is it any wonder why the country moved to the left as we moved from "Newsman" to "Journalist"? All part of the 'greater mission'.  This move by Sulzberger to reinstate Lelyveld, then, seems to me designed to maintain status quo particularly as regards this “mission” which is exactly what the Times, and for that matter, this nation’s news gathering orgs do NOT need.  After all, Raines originally replaced Lelyveld for one reason only; Raines was more of an adherent to that “mission” than Lelyveld. Oddly enough, Raines got himself and his paper into trouble for just that reason, though the left wil claim otherwise, of course.  Lelyveld is a player here again, only because Sulzberger needs a fallback position in the fight toward the satisfaction of that  “mission”.  On the bright side, though, this can be considered a positive event, given that it has called attention to a left leaning press syndrome the left has always denied is there. At least now, it’s going to be far harder for the left to longer deny its existence.  That said, nothing, I fear will make such a position impossible for the left. No lie is ever too far fetched for them to latch onto.   As for the Times itself, it is less of a liability to our country and our culture than it was, at the least. How MUCH less, remains to be seen. Personally, I won’t be holding my breath waiting for the changes that are really needed there.

      0626031934-   Rochester NY----  In 1964, we here in the US passed a far-reaching civil rights act, which reaffirmed that all men are  created equal, and are to be treated as such, regardless of the individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It made such discrimination unlawful. Period. The new law made racism unlawful regardless of the effect of such race weighting, be it  detrimental OR beneficial.    Court rulings since have repeatedly and wisely noted that this act was directly in line with  the  14th Amendment to the Constitution.    “No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”  (Emphasis is mine)    So, along comes two recent court rulings  which I’ve spent the last several nights going over, You should as well.  The result of these two rulings, at least in combination is confusion.   In the case of Gratz v. Bollinger, the court ruling point blank that the practice of adding 20 points to the possible 150 points in the admissions system for simply being a favored minority, is unconstitutional  Good so far.   Then comes the confusion:  The court’s ruling Grutter v. Bollinger, basically re-affirms the Bakke ruling, which essentially is that race SHOULD be a factor when dealing with admissions.  The ruling does go on to state that yes, the policy does, in fact “reaffirm the Law School's longstanding commitment to one particular type of diversity," That is to say, it engages in racial bias. Not only that, but racial bias that is subjective, arbitrary, and subject to the bias of those running the program. (I would defy anyone to tell me that this description doesn’t capture the situation in Alabama back in the 50’s…. )     So much for Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream that we will "live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character." This ruiling cuts that idea off at the knees.   So much for Justice John Marshall Harlan's dissenting opinion in Plessy v. Ferguson saying "The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color."     So much for the Civil rights act of 1964.   And,  for that matter, so much for the 14th amendment.   Worse, it appears that the Court’s defacto overturning of these ideals was intended to fix a problem that did not exist… There has never been documented discrimination that has ever surfaced at the University of Michigan as regards admissions.  Not one.  As a matter of fact, because of the policy that was being defended by the school, Black students were 170 times more likely than whites to be admitted to the Ann Arbor school. The Court however, ignored this point, and claimed it’s ruling to be acting on the basis of the “compelling interest in obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body"   Well, I have two arguments against this as a basis.   *Such an interest is by no means a constitutional argument, but rather, a political argument… and a short-term political argument at that.  Even the key vote in this case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's declares, "...we expect that 25 years from now, the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary."   One presumes that at such a point, the court will again be asked to rule, and will reverse its decision.  For the sake of discussion, and examination, let’s assume the constitution remains fairly well static between now and then, as it has for much of it’s 200 plus years of life. If the need, much less the remedy, is a constitutional issue, how could such measures EVER NOT be needed?  Unless the constitution itself changes, something doesn’t change status from constitutional to  unconstitutional and back again. These race-based initiatives are both illegal and unconstitutional. So to effect this ruling, we must ignore the Constitution.   So, the court figures maybe in 25 years (…. Or, maybe not… Justice Ginsburg reminds us we can’t accept a guarantee of the timing, here…) these measures won’t be needed anymore.  Did we simply put the Constitution on “hold” for 25 years or more, until someone decides to start enforcing the Constitution? If so, what’s to guarantee we won’t disregard it again, at some need or other, and for less popular reasons?   Despite even that concern, this nonsense might be a little easier to accept if I thought for one hot second that in 25 years, or 2500 years, for that matter, that given this ruling, and these guidelines, racism would magically disappear altogether. I could even see an argument that it might be worth the sacrifice… if it showed any hope whatever of working as advertised.  It doesn’t.  This ruling is counter productive to that goal, and will not have that effect, which leads me to my second point:    **There is a major difference between mandating what we’ll call “RACIAL Diversity” and encouraging “TRUE Diversity”. “Racial diversity” simply means we have a lot of different races represented in a given sector of society. “True diversity” means that we have a lot of different styles of thinking, points of view, politics, ideation, etc. regardless of the race of each individual involved.      As such, I submit there is no compelling state or societal interest in mandating Racial Diversity per se’, in a racially neutral society, which we are supposedly striving to be.     Make no mistake from my comments; Diversity of thought… of ideas, or opinions is a fine goal… to be lauded and it constitutes the largest interest of the state.  It should be pursued. Apparently that’s the goal being sought by the Court, when it seeks to force diversity by forcing racial diversity.   I must give the court credit for keeping that goal in mind.    However, can the pursuit of that goal get tangled when we try to get there through mandated racial diversity? Can it get wrapped up in stereotypical nonsense?  It appears so. Consider the comments of Justice Anthony Kennedy, who in his dissent, cited the testimony of a former director of admissions at the UM Law School that when the question came up about whether Cubans should be counted as Hispanics, one professor objected on the grounds that Cubans were Republicans. Do you think Racial Equality was foremost on THAT gent’s mind, or was it pure, liberal-biased, stereotyping politics, base on race alone?     The Court in Bollinger seems to be working under the idea that they’ll get us to True Diversity, through mandating Racial Diversity. This is a flawed, possibly fatal path to the stated goals of True Diversity and our being a racially neutral society. Following this path in fact will reverse much of the good work done already toward the essential goal of making us a less race conscious, and more race-neutral nation, as the Constitution demands. Even the court itself, in Justice O’Conner’s writings, tacitly admits this.    This court-directed pursuit of True Diversity by means of counting the color of each nose going by the admissions gate in our schools,  (and one presumes, other sectors of our society, as well) is based on the revolting assumption that a person’s race is in total control of their thought processes, opinions, and their ideas.  Not only will I point out that such stereotyping is in fact racism, I say it is racism of a most ugly kind. It is one that should not be tolerated under ANY condition, least of which under the guise of ‘diversity’.   We fought a rather vicious war, about half a century back, against a group of people called Nazis, led by an idiot with a weird mustache who operated under that same racist idea, that race is at the center of one’s being, that ones thoughts, actions and ideas are all dependant on their race, and it’s purity.  Re-applied here in the US, as the court seems to be allowing, here, this idea will at least lead down the road of racial stereotyping and increased racial consciousness.    The Law school ruling is particularly troubling in it’s inconsistency with the writings this week of the ruling’s principle author, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor, who wrote on Thursday in Georgia vs. Ashcroft, that “ the court should be working to  “…encourage the transition to a society where race no longer matters: a society where integration and color-blindness are not just qualities to be proud of, but are simple facts of life."   Nice words, and commendable, and quite correct. Thing is,  that stated goal is 180 degrees out of phase with the Bollinger  ruling.  Possibly it’s more accurate to suggest that the Bollinger ruling was off kilter with everything else.   One more point not too many people like talking about was brought forward by Justice Thomas, who cited Morehouse College, where lass than 1%  of the student body was white, or Hispanic. “Do we have any sense”, Thomas argues, “that the traditionally black colleges will now start admitting more whites for the sake of diversity?  “  Thomas of course is correct.  How, if at all, will this ruling change the racial balance situations in those places? Isn’t diversity equally valuable in those places? Rather makes one wonder about the value some place on this mandate of racial diversity.  Do not mistake my comments. I do not question the members of the court on their desire to get our society to a situation where racism doesn’t exist. Nor do I suggest that this is not a valid and worthy, and indeed, a vital goal.  I do question, however using racism as a tool to fight racism, on logical, moral, AND constitutional grounds. I say again: Diversity of race for it’s own sake is racism, plain and simple.  Thurgood Marshall warned us about such things in Brown:   "Distinctions by race are so evil, so arbitrary and invidious that a state, bound to defend the equal protection of the laws must not invoke them in any public sphere."    It angers me that this court has ignored that admonition. What angers me more is that also they ignored the advise of someone closer to the hearts of most Americans than Marshall… Namely, Frederick Douglass, a fellow Rochesterian, who addressed this point as well as any I can think of, even though the haze that 150 years of language difference can and does bring:   "What I ask for the Negro, is not benevolence, not pity, not sympathy, but simply justice . . .. All I ask is, give him a chance to stand on his own legs! Let him alone!….. ..our interference is doing him positive injury."   The court has once again, disregarded these pleas. All that’s left behind is more confusion, and more of the legal racism we’ve been trying to rid ourselves from since the middle 1800’s..    The court took these Michigan cases, supposedly to end the argument about the constitutionality of  racial bias being applied to try and solve racial bias. (Irony abounds)    The answer to this issue was obvious, and the court missed it, trying to find shades of grey where they simply do not exist.   Racism is, ironically, a black and white issue, as are most things, in the end. It’s either there, or it’s not. It’s either legal, or it’s not. We either support racism in our system of laws, or we don’t.   A clear-cut ruling, reaffirming the dreams of Dr King, the pleas from Mr. Douglass, the advise of Justice Marshall, Justice Harlan, and the law of the land in the form of the 14th amendment was what was needed. Instead, what we got flew in the face of all of that wisdom.      Americans of all races will suffer for that error.

      091503224531 Rochester NY --   It is something of an indication of where we are, in the state of the western world, when we can pass our time, and our anger in relative minutiae. As someone else recently noted to me; when the exact location of Madonna's tongue, or the on again off again wedding plans for Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are considered front page news, you can pretty much figure we're still here; that the threats we face are not larger, at least, than they were the day before.   One conclusion to be drawn from this is one you’re not likely to see mentioned in the press of today, given their leftist lean. Specifically, that the White House is doing a far better job than they're being given credit for by the leftists who desperately want back into the place. Indeed, were any of the current crop of challengers to obtain it, I wonder if they could do as good a job and President Bush and his people have done? Somehow, I tend to doubt it. I wonder if anyone else will make that connection?   Consider it; yes, we're involved in a war, one that was brought to us, and had we had someone more vigilant in office during the 90’s would have been avoided. Yes, we must be vigilant, more so than we have in the past. But as I say, we could have used a little more vigilance anyway.   However that may be, it is indisputable, that the Islamofacists, who sought to bring us to our knees as a nation and as a culture, have not succeeded. It is they, not us and our friends, who are on the run. We're in a state of normalcy that few would have predicted, two years ago today.... a state that had we had different leadership, would certainly not exist today.   There is no other conclusion that may be drawn here, but that the President and his people are doing an excellent job; does anyone seriously think if they were not, that we would not be under attack as you read this? Does anyone seriously consider that they're holding back on the goodness of their hearts?   No. They only available answer is that thanks to the leadership of President Bush, Al Quieda's leadership has been all but destroyed. bin Laden is likely dead. But even if he is alive, he's been reduced to threats delivered by audiotape of questionable origins. The training camps have been shut down, most of the leadership is dead, jailed, or on the run. Instead of attacking our citizens, they're forced to defend themselves from our military, which is why the attacks outside of Iraq (and Israel) have all but halted.   The rabid dogs that saw us as fear- filled, soft, gutless, who saw us as an easy pushover, and so attacked us, have had their heads returned to them via parcel post. This is no small accomplishment, though the left tries to separate this victory from its import, and from the man who led us to it.   To my mind there are some serious questions about the reason behind the willingness to so seriously question President Bush’s obvious leadership ability and motives. Given what is clearly at stake, here, it seems clear that the President’s leftist opponents at the very least are placing their own political power needs, over the needs of the country.   These people have been about denying the danger we were and are in, apparently to try and wrest power away from the center and the right that they hate so much. Yet these too are being less than successful.   Recent polling data suggests that the connections between Saddam Hussein and Al Quieda that have always existed, are now seen and understood by all but the loudest 30% of Americans, including the anti-American left. In this grouping, I include the anti-Bush at all costs Democrats... Including all of the Democrats currently running for the Presidential Nomination of that party.   The reason the steady drumbeat of “it’s all Bush’s fault” has fallen off the front page is really rather simple: The American public isn’t buying the usual Democrat/socialist Mantra. Regardless of what this very vocal and very desperate minority claims, The people know there is no longer any question that Saddam Hussein's Iraq was training Islamic terrorists south of Baghdad at a place called the Salman Pak Training Facility. This point has been repeatedly confirmed both by documentation found by our troops as they wade through the mass of documentation, but also by Iraqi defectors. We also know, through financial records, that Saddam Hussein was paying millions to Ayman al-Zawahiri, who was bin Laden's chief deputy.   It's only the anti-Americans who claim this is false that the troops and the defectors are lying, else that it's been "exaggerated." Again, in this title of 'anti-Americans" I include liberal Democrats.   As an example of the anti-Americanism, I offer a quote that Andrew Sullivan points up in his blog the other day; a quote from Jonathan Schell, which seems to say it all; it sums up the anti-Americanism embedded in the left wing:   "Biden says we must win the war. This is precisely wrong. The United States must learn to lose this war Ã‚– a harder task, in many ways, than winning, for it requires admitting mistakes and relinquishing attractive fantasies. This is the true moral mission of our time (well, of the next few years, anyway)." - Jonathan Schell, saying out loud what many on the Left believe, and have long believed. Good that some of them are finally being more honest about their loathing of the West.   The Democrats should not be trusted, having been exposed as liars,and as anti-American to the core.Those who vote for Democrats are electing the enemies of America. It's really that simple, that direct, and that profound.... Their goals, if realized, will weaken us to our destruction. They should certainly not be allowed anywhere near the reins of power.   To give this point some focus, (this cannot be overstated) consider that we'd not be discussing this at all, that 9/11 would never have happened at all, had their hero Bill Clinton, actually done what he swore to do when he took the oath of office.... being vigilant enough to protect our country, not simply to divert attention from his latest lie.   Which brings me to an offer; those making all these claims against the President; I say, let them come forward. But let them do so with the same levels of proof in hand that they demanded for the charges of most Americans, against Bill Clinton.

      The pattern is established more firmly, and I'm more disgusted.   About a year or so back, I wrote about Trent Lott and his problems with liberals taking highly questionable interpretations of his statements at Strom Thurmond's funeral, and fanning the fires of racism.   In that column, I drew parallels between that manufactured controversy, and one happening here in my own hometown of Rochester, NY. I found it interesting that the two occurrences should be recorded so close on the timeline to one another... at a juncture of history where the Democrats needed the electoral help such controversy invariably brings them.   Which brings us up to the current day, wherein the Democrats are once again in trouble, electorially speaking, with an election coming up. Once again, Democrats take questionable interpretations of positions their favorite targets take, and fan the flames of racism, both on the national stage, and here locally, apparently, in both cases trying to stir their base. And what do you know... we're dealing with the same nonsense, involving, oddly enough, the same players locally.   Take a look at what I wrote at the time. The parameters of that situation are remarkably like the more recent ones. Suspiciously so.   For the national picture, Rush Limbaugh is, simply put, the biggest target out there, being the country's most prominent conservative. He is, thereby, the biggest blockage to their efforts to regain power in Washington DC. And conveniently, he's also a rich white guy. So, the attack by the left on the following statement:    "I don't think he's been that good from the get-go. I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. There is a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of this team that he didn't deserve. The defense carried this team."    Bootz break it down better than most…    "1. Donovan McNabb hasn't been a very good quarterback from the beginning.   Anything racist there? If there is, I can't find it. Do we now find ourselves at the point where you cannot criticize a black athlete without being called a racist?   2. The National Football League has some social concerns.   Translation, there's a bit of political correctness in the NFL front office. I don't know if that's true or not. You tell me! Is there anything inherently wrong with bringing up the possibility?   3. Some sportswriters want to see a black quarterback do well.   Well now isn't that a shocking statement! Can you imagine that! A few weeks ago a female place kicker actually kicked a field goal in a Division 1A college football game. Do you think that it is at all possible that there were some sportswriters out there, maybe even some female sportswriters, who wanted to see that kick go through the uprights? Would that make these sportswriters sexist? So we find it perfectly reasonable to understand why a female sportswriter might  want to see that gal kick that football, but you just can't imagine a black sportswriter wanting to see a black quarterback succeed? Come on, admit it. You went to government schools, didn't you?   4. Donovan McNabb has been getting more credit for the team's success than perhaps he deserves.   Maybe so, maybe not! I'm certainly not knowledgeable enough to comment on that. I couldn't name any Eagles player other than McNabb .. and if it weren't for this story I wouldn't even be able to name him. I'm just not that much of a fan. But can't a question like this be addressed to literally hundreds of players in each of the four major sports?   So .. there you go. Rush's statement broken down into four easily understandable statements, none of which is the slightest bit racially insensitive, let alone racist."    Indeed… Rush says himself, correctly:    "I'm not the one that's even introduced race in this, if you want to know the truth. You can go back. You can read Philadelphia sports media last year, the year before, and you can see that guys have been writing about the great things that Donovan McNabb's success means in a racial context."    Locally, here in Rochester, Bob Lonsberry was certainly one of the biggest voices locally for the centrists and those right of center, and was thereby the most visible blockage to the left's gaining power at the County level, here in the upcoming election, in the form of a black Mayor who has been a dismal failure in that role, trying to get to the county level of government…   So, just as before, within a week, both these folks come under fire for supposedly racist comments they made while on-air. Yet when the charges are dissected, they're found at best wanting, and in truth outright fabrications… just as the cases I discussed in the earlier article.   I know; it sounds like I'm making the charge that these attacks are coordinated and deliberate, and launched for the sole purpose of political gain... in fact being what Bill Clinton called the politics of personal destruction being waged by liberal Democrats. And you know what? You're quite right; that's exactly what I'm saying. When Liberals want to fire up the base, they charge racism. It's knee-jerk time.   And now of course, from the Journalism Standard that is the National Enquirer comes word that someone in the state or Florida is tossing Limbaugh’s name around as regards an investigation of abuse of prescription drugs? Anyone want to bet that the one doing this supposed investigation is a Florida Democrat still ticked off that Gore lost?   I mean, come on, now. Can anyone seriously look at all these events, and NOT conclude that each was an orchestrated and collectively coordinated event?

      It's about time.   The Bush White House is finally starting to deal with the PR problems involved with the war in Iraq and our actions afterward. So far,  they've been letting the naysayers in on the left,rule public opinion. (Which as you will recall, includes the so-called mainstream press.)  The facts, however, are vastly different than the left makes them. While looking at the website for the Iraqi Provisional government, I noted the text of a speech by Paul Bremmer. I've been watching this site with some interest since it first went up. It is interesting how closely the events listed here parallel the events as reported by those leaving Iraq... and how wildly they differ from the leftist media.    Six months ago there were no police on duty in Iraq. · Today there are over 40,000 police on duty, nearly 7,000 here in Baghdad alone. · Last night Coalition Forces and Iraqi police conducted 1,731 joint patrols.  Six months ago those elements of Saddam’s military that had not been destroyed in combat had buried their airplanes and melted away.  · Today the first battalion of the new Iraqi Army has graduated and is on active duty. · Across the country over 60,000 Iraqis now provide security to their fellow citizens.  Six months ago there were no functioning courts in Iraq. · Today nearly all of Iraq’s 400 courts are functioning. · Today, for the first time in over a generation, the Iraqi judiciary is fully independent.  Six months ago the entire country could generate a bare 300 megawatts of electricity. · On Monday, October 6 power generation hit 4,518 megawatts—exceeding the pre-war average. ·· If we get the funding the President has requested in his emergency budget, we expect to produce enough electricity for all Iraqis to have electrical service 24 hours daily—something essential to their hopes for the future.  Six months ago nearly all of Iraq’s schools were closed. · Today all 22 universities and 43 technical institutes and colleges are open, as are nearly all primary and secondary schools. · Many of you know that we announced our plan to rehabilitate one thousand schools by the time school started—well, by October 1 we had actually rehabbed over 1,500.  Six months ago teachers were paid as little as $5.33 per month. · Today teachers earn from 12 to 25 times their former salaries.  Six months ago the public health system was an empty shell. During the 1990’s Saddam cut spending on public health by over 90 percent with predictable results for the lives of his citizens. · Today we have increased public health spending to over 26 times what it was under Saddam. · Today all 240 hospitals and more than 1200 clinics are open. · Today doctors’ salaries are at least eight times what they were under Saddam. · Pharmaceutical distribution has gone from essentially nothing to 700 tons in May to a current total of 12,000 tons. · Since liberation we have administered over 22 million vaccination doses to Iraq’s children.  Six months ago three-quarters of Iraq’s 27,000 kilometers of irrigation canals were weed-choked and barely functional. · Today a Coalition program has cleared over 14,000 kilometers of those canals. They now irrigate tens of thousands of farms. This project has created jobs for more than 100,000 Iraqi men and women.  Additionally, we have restored over three-quarters of pre-war telephone services and over two-thirds of the potable water production.   Before the war there were 4,500 Internet connections and important services, such as instant messaging were forbidden. · Today there are 4,900 full-service connections. · We expect 50,000 by January first.   Six months ago Iraq’s economy was flat on its back. · Today anyone walking the streets can see the wheels of commerce turning. From bicycles to satellite dishes to cars and trucks, businesses are coming to life in all major cities and towns.  Six months ago all banks were closed. · Today 95 percent of all pre-war bank customers have service and first-time customers are opening accounts daily. · Today Iraqi banks are making loans to finance businesses. · Today the central bank is fully independent. · Today Iraq has one of the world’s most growth-oriented investment and banking laws. · Next week Iraq will get a single, unified currency for the first time in 15 years.  Six months ago there was no freedom of expression. Satellite dishes were illegal. Foreign journalists came on 10-day visas and paid mandatory and extortionate fees to the Ministry of Information for “minders” and other government spies. · Today there is no Ministry of Information. · Today there are more than 170 newspapers. · Today you can buy satellite dishes on what seems like every street corner. · Today foreign journalists and everyone else are free to come and go.   Six months ago Iraq had not one single element—legislative, judicial or executive-- of a representative government. · Today in Baghdad alone residents have selected 88 advisory councils. Baghdad’s first democratic transfer of power in 35 years happened when the city council elected its new chairman. · Today in Iraq chambers of commerce, business, school and professional organizations are electing their leaders all over the country. · Today 25 ministers, selected by the most representative governing body in Iraq’s history, run the day-to-day business of government. · Today the Iraqi government regularly participates in international events. Since July the Iraqi government has been represented in over two dozen international meetings, including those of the UN General Assembly, the Arab League, the World Bank and IMF and, today, the Islamic Conference Summit. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today announced that it is reopening over 30 Iraqi embassies around the world.  Six months ago Shia religious festivals were all but banned. · Today, for the first time in 35 years, in Karbala thousands of Shiites celebrate the pilgrimage of the 12th Imam.     An amazing list of accomplishments, made al the more amazing that we're not hearing them from the leftist press.  And, let's call this waht it is; These are all things the left would have us not doing. Had they their own way, Iraq would still be ruled by SoDamn Insane.   I should give Kudos here to Andrew Sullivan, who apparently also monitors that Provisional site. His take on the subject bears repeating:      It's simply beyond me how anyone can describe this war as about "oil" or about "imperialism" or about "greed" or "militarism." It remains one of the most humanitarian acts in modern history. And, if successful, it could turn an entire region around - a region that has been the main source of real danger to itself and to the West in my lifetime. I'm banging on about this not simply because it's by far the most important issue in our politics right now, but because a wilful and petty disinformation campaign is being waged to distort this achievement, undermine it, and reverse it. We mustn't let that happen. We cannot let these people - and ourselves - down again.     Sullivan is correct, here.  Can't one Democrat come forward and say that we've done a good thing over there?  Or is it as I've suggested in the past, that there ARE no good Democrats?  What it is.... I guess I shouldn't be surprised by their omission; Clearly these being good things, run afoul of their worldview. They'd rather stand on the sidelines and claim Iraq HAD no WMD program, and was never a threat to us. They even point to the recently released Kay report, claiming it proves their point; that Saddam had no WMD. They must not be reading the same report I have on file here.     Here's what Kay has to say on those subjects:     "We Have Discovered Dozens Of WMD-Related Program Activities And Significant Amounts Of Equipment That Iraq Concealed From The United Nations During The Inspections That Began In Late 2002." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "A clandestine network of laboratories and safehouses within the Iraqi Intelligence Service that contained equipment subject to UN monitoring and suitable for continuing CBW [Chemical and Biological Weapons] research." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "A prison laboratory complex, possibly used in human testing of BW [Biological Weapons] agents, that Iraqi officials working to prepare for UN inspections were explicitly ordered not to declare to the UN." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "Reference strains of biological organisms concealed in a scientist's home, one of which can be used to produce biological weapons." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "New research on BW-applicable agents, Brucella and Congo Crimean Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF), and continuing work on ricin and aflatoxin were not declared to the UN." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "Documents and equipment, hidden in scientists' homes, that would have been useful in resuming uranium enrichment by centrifuge and electromagnetic isotope separation (EMIS)." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "A line of UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles] not fully declared at an undeclared production facility and an admission that they had tested one of their declared UAVs out to a range of 500 km, 350 km beyond the permissible limit." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "Continuing covert capability to manufacture fuel propellant useful only for prohibited SCUD variant missiles, a capability that was maintained at least until the end of 2001 and that cooperating Iraqi scientists have said they were told to conceal from the UN." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "Plans and advanced design work for new long-range missiles with ranges up to at least 1000 km - well beyond the 150 km range limit imposed by the UN. Missiles of a 1000 km range would have allowed Iraq to threaten targets through out the Middle East, including Ankara, Cairo, and Abu Dhabi." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "Clandestine attempts between late-1999 and 2002 to obtain from North Korea technology related to 1,300 km range ballistic missiles --probably the No Dong -- 300 km range anti-ship cruise missiles, and other prohibited military equipment." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "With regard to Iraq's nuclear program, the testimony we have obtained from Iraqi scientists and senior government officials should clear up any doubts about whether Saddam still wanted to obtain nuclear weapons. They have told ISG [Iraq Survey Group] that Saddam Husayn remained firmly committed to acquiring nuclear weapons." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)  "In Addition To The Discovery Of Extensive Concealment Efforts, We Have Been Faced With A Systematic Sanitization Of Documentary And Computer Evidence In A Wide Range Of Offices, Laboratories, And Companies Suspected Of WMD Work." (David Kay, Statement On The Interim Progress Report On The Activities Of The Iraq Survey Group, 10/2/03)       I think it clear that all we're seeing out of the socialist left is spinning, lies, and omissions, issued for the purpose of putting the worst spin possible on President Bush, so as to regain political power. Apparently, they're working on the same principal that another infamous socialist relied on: A lie, often enough told, become truth.  Just remember; if we followed them Saddam would still be in power.  And 9/11 would have been merely a prelude.

      1025032019-Rochester,NY--   The real story of the last few years, at least in a political perspective - is that the Democrats seem to have lost their sense of direction. That factor is going to play very large in this next election, as it has the last few.   The increasingly nasty attacks on fellow Democrats and other parties alike, combined with a lack of direction reminiscent of headless chickens, leads one to understand just how desperate the plight of today's Democrat has become.   But what brought them to this state of affairs? The reality of the results of liberal polices combined, ironically, with the triangulation politics of Bill Clinton.   To fully understand their plight, one needs to go back into the history of the last 50 or so years. ... A history during which they dominated the American political scene..-when they WERE "The Man" that so many leftists were protesting against.   The claims of the Democrats superiority of foreign policy built at so high a cost in WWII, ended up taking it on the chin in Korea and Vietnam, ended utterly in the colapse of the Soviet Union under Ronald Reagan.   Their domestic policies as well, have been seen by all but the far left as an utter failure. Their claims of superiority vis-à-vis equal rights, sank into nothingness when Republicans started noting that the majority of those who voted for them were not Democrats... in fact that the majority of Democrats voted AGAINST the 64 civil rights act.   The Great Society unintentionally but inevitably exposed the Democrat's mantra of using government handouts to lift all people as the fallacy it is... and this is a point we're reminded of frequently as we pay for the loons used to create great society programs.   The Demand management that is Keynesian economics was exposed as fraud when it had it's biggest impact under Jimmy Carter's stagflation.   And finally, the claim to moral authority disappeared under the criminal behavior of Bill Clinton, and the all-out defense of his actions by the Democrat leadership.   Ironically, it all started really falling apart for Democrats as Bill Clinton was running against George Bush. Clinton and his advisers, (most notably Dick Morris) understood clearly that the Democrat's traditional ideas and ideals had all been disproven in the public sphere.     So, what was needed was a mixture of their traditional stands on things, and some of the more moderate, and indeed, conservative ideas. Failure to so so would have certainly meant a loss for the Democrats in Bill Clinton.   That point, I think, contains the seeds of failure for the Democrats since Clinton left office. That's because it was the point at which the Democrats began to understand that their positions on their traditional bread and butter issues no longer resonated with the voters. Most of that being because of the failures I've gone over above. Of course, the Democrats blaming the American people for the failures didn't help them much either.   In any event, the Democrats at this point found themselves being moved away from their baseline, just to stay in the running at the voting booth. This has resulted in a split in the Democrat ranks, that has been more pronounced the last few years. This explains to a large degree how nasty the Democrats are getting with everybody, including each other.   That split between the comparative moderates like Joe Lieberman, and the Dennis "Moonbeam" Kucinich crowd, has resulted in the Democrats appearing that they don't know what they want to be when they grow up. Which, in turn, results in them losing elections.   The result, then is that the Democrats are more desperate, and more shrill... increasingly so. Even John Kerry has publicly acknowledged the situation:      "I think the crowded field allows the most shrill, conflict-oriented, confrontational voices to be heard, and not necessarily the person who might make the best candidate or the best president. They're very superficial."      That fits. So are the candidates.   Of course the American people, if we can take recent polling data, and the California Recall as any indication, finally see all of this. And in the end, will give Republicans the reins, in record numbers, this next election.

      Euclid, OH,110903141032--   Ignoble    We're in Ohio this afternoon to catch  a concert. We came down last night, and will be back in town on Monday. As this is being written we are waiting for Trace Adkins to take the stage, and as we wait, I am mulling over the news we got on the way here regarding the car bombing in Saudi-Arabia.  As of this writing, all I was able to get was that 5 people had died, more injured, and I got the impression more would die as a result of their injuries. (Editor's note: 15 people as of 11/11)  This attack, and the results of it are very different from the rest, and it appears a new trend is starting to show itself.  What is so remarkable about this attack, what is different, this time, is that it appears Muslims were targeted. Else, at the least the attackers didn't care how many Muslims they would kill and injure.  I fully understand that judging what the attackers are after, based on what they attack, is problematic at best because there are a number of forces at work, here that are not all of a piece.  Yet logically, based on these attacks, one could ask now, as never before in recent times,  if a religious fervor was *ever* at the heart of the reasoning behind ElQuieda and it's actions. This question is far more central than some here in the US would make it, because it speaks to the question of other Arab nations supporting the remainder of the world in their war.....and war it is... with ElQuieda.  I suspect that as a result of this attack, we will see far more in the way of support from Arab nations, both direct and indirect. The notable exceptions of this would be Syria and possibly Iran.  It seems to me that by their reactions the battle lines will be drawn. I fully expect the Saudis to be very co-operative indeed with the west going forward.  And the cause for this bedrock change in conditions was the inevitable... the bloodthirsty idiots attacking the people still sitting on the fence... and pushing them over to our side of it. IN the end, the only thing this will do is help us in our struggle.   Noble   I want to speak briefly about Veteran's day which comes up this week. It's always been a special day for me, more so the last 15 years because my Donna and I got married 11/11/89.  It's always been a special day for me anyway, though, because honoring our vets has always held special meaning for me; it's a lesson my parents instilled very well, indeed. It was brought home to me, as I was recently looking at pictures from a trip we made through the Gettysburg PA area some years ago.  It's a particularly meaningful thing, when you're standing on that field.... something that goes well beyond the cold facts and figures about who died from what company, how old they were, or even where they were from. It's more a feeling you get.... you can sense it... not unlike being at Ground Zero in lower Manhattan, or visiting Arlington National Cemetery. I'm told Omaha Beach, and Pearl Harbor and many other sites are the same way. I've been at the funerals of firemen and policemen who died in their line of duty, and that was also remarkably similar.   In each case, we're dealing with places and concepts of death.  But death alone doesn't do it; doesn't create that solemn atmosphere that is so unique to the above places.  After all; there are lots of mass casualty accidents have happened over the centuries and their sites are well marked, and revered, or at least held apart, and yet, their impact doesn't approach that of an Iwo Jima or a Pearl.  Even under the shelter of the relative safety of the time that has passed since the events, as you stand in each place, you can still feel it; Lives were lost there that were willingly (And in the case of the civilian deaths at the towers, unwillingly) sacrificed toward a higher ideal.  Our feelings and conclusions can be far different from what those lost experienced. Yet, their lives and their sacrifices still count for something. And the thing is, it doesn't take much for us to out ourselves in their mindset.  Think of it this way; Every single man who died at Gettysburg, at Normandy, at Pearl and all he rest, has meaning for us because each of them, had their own lives, just as we have our own  lives.  These people loved, they laughed, they cried. They had a favorite food, a favorite color, a particular bit of music, or of poetry stirred their souls, like none other, just like we, ourselves. Every bit as much as you and I love our lives, they loved theirs. Their lives were as precious to them, as yours is to you. Their loss was as keenly felt by their loved ones as yours would yours. And yet, they gave their lives up, for something bigger.  I have a neighbor, whose father just recently needed a liver transplant. This neighbor willingly gave up part of his liver to be transplanted into his father. A noble action, certainly, commendable, and impressive.  But with all respect to my neighbor, the choice to do that is comparatively easy to make. He knows and loves his father, and the sacrifice is fairly light by comparison.  How much  more noble is a sacrifice of one's life for people that one will never meet? Well, the people we honor today, those in uniform particularly, but some who were not,  gave of themselves for the benefit of people they would never know.... you and I, and countless others from many nations. If not for their sacrifices, you'd not be reading this BIT, because I'd not have written it.... we'd be living in a very different world, possibly, one not nearly as good to us as it has been.  Look upon those actions, those sacrifices, and know what you're seeing is strength, courage, and nobility in measures that should not... can not, be ignored. It must be honored by us all; it was made, after all for our benefit.  Think about that as we deal with the solemn proceedings for their day.

      112403202738-Rochester NY     You've seen it on TV already.  A group of insurgents swarm around the vehicle in traffic, preventing it from moving. They attack the driver with the weapons they've brought.  They pull him from the vehicle. They proceed to punch and kick him, to the point where he's senseless, and utterly helpless. They celebrate their victory, dancing around.  Then, not satisfied, they start tossing cement blocks at his head as he lies helpless and bleeding on the ground. Still not satisfied, they commence looting the truck they dragged him out of.  Does this scene cause you to wonder why we are in this area at all? Perhaps this causes you to think that these natives are reacting to aggression on the part of the one they are attacking? Perhaps you think this an indication we should withdraw from the area and let these angry people solve their own problems, since we are unable to solve them- that they don't want our help?  In defense of our actions in the area in question, it should be pointed out that a vast, if undocumented, majority of the natives in the area support our government's actions towards them, and find these attacks and their perpetrators abhorrent. This will do little, I suppose, to change the minds of some. Nor will it change the reality that we are there and will continue to be so for the foreseeable future.  I suppose that there are some  area warlords who delight in the kind of attacks I have described. I suppose further that they consider such attacks justified, for reasons only known to them. Yet, clearly, this is neither the view or the will of the majority in the area.  In poll after poll,  the large majority of people living in the area support the actions of the government against those making these attacks.  At the same time, the people saying they are against these attacks seem fearful about actually doing anything for fear such attacks will be aimed at them for simply speaking out.  Oh, I see. You thought that I was describing Mosel or perhaps Tickrit. I guess I can understand your confusion: I rather designed it that way.  But, no. The frightful scene I have just described took place in East Los Angeles. The person being attacked is Reginald Denny.    The point I am making of course is that the two situations can get confused, one for the other, at all.  The obvious question becomes one of different responses in each situation. I have seen no calls for us to withdraw from East LA.  Indeed, the left has suggested more armed agents of our government be placed there, along with the added investment of government dollars.  I am by no means suggesting that the two situations are wholly analogous.  Indeed, I am not suprised at all that the backers of our actions in the war on terrorism have not used this juxtaposition to argue their case... The parallels are less than firmly drawn.  Yet, there are similarities which are hard to deny, and questions about our responses to each situation, that also arise from those similarities... Questions that I don't claim to have all the answers to...but ones that will certainly make the leftists uncomfortable with not only President Bush's position on Iraq, but their own as well, I expect.  By no means are leftists going to call for a reduced commitment to the the people of East LA because of these attacks, as they are Iraq. To do so would at the least, incur the wrath of the East LA voters... Voters who have a long history of voting left of center.  We will doubtless be led to think that pouring tax dollars into East LA is some sort of humanitarian gesture... That it is humanitarianism which motivates them.  You have to wonder, though, how they can make such claims when these same people have suggested that our reaction in Iraq was over-blown...and some even suggesting the Iraqi people were better off under Saddam, than they are under the freedom we've provided them.     When the leftists object to the war on terror, are kindness and humanitarianism their motives?     Or is it rather simply political power the left is after?      Just something to think about as you watch the political posturing going on.

      113003214800--Rochester.NY  HEADLINE: President Bush Goes to Iraq  What a brilliant bit of being president!  What a fabulous story this is!  Now, it didn't take long at all for about everyone to see that this at least was going to mean a tremendous boost to Bush's popularity numbers. Which of course means that Democrats and the leftist media were going to try and find a way to spin this against him.  But a funny thing happened on the way to the microphones; The Democrat leadership couldn't get their act together, and all came out looking like idiots. And the rank and file is getting rather desperate.  As soon as this story broke on Thanksgiving day,  I jumped on the net and went over to Democraticunderground.com, where I found: (Warning; the language is about what you'd expect from someone of their mental capacity.)     I fear that this one gesture will be the tipping point past which * re-connects with wavering white males and so-called independents. The media is ga-ga over this farce of a visit. The messages from the whore centers will get much more syrupy and orgasmic as the weekend approaches cultminating in a literal ejactulation of praise and wonder on the sunday talk shows. Even Democratic senators will be stepping all over themselves to praise *'s holy visit as an act of courage and daring-do. It won't be pretty and it won't be easy to take.  I feel in my gut that this changes everything. The sheeple are just beginning to pay attention to the dawning political season and, for many, this stunt will be their initial waking image: "Our President is indeed a cool guy. Our President is indeed brave and true. Our President risked his life to visit our troops." And yada yada yada yada .....  Counter that with Dashle, and Biden, and Zell Miller, and all the rest of the regular cast of mealy-mouthed spinless Dems who, mark my words, will end up praising the piss-ant poseur, and what do you have? You have the very real makings of a blowout landslide for fascism and all that is transparently un-american gaining unambiguous approval in November of 2004.  This is the worst I've felt in my entire life on this shithole of a planet in this shithole of a country. I can't image what I'll feel like in early November 2004. I can't imagine feeling worse than I do right now but I've got to prepare myself for something I dread and fear to the very depth of my soul: The final and irrevokable loss of our democracy to fascism.  What the fuck have we become? In the final analysis it was all just so much sand sifting through our fingers. Just so much sand.    Amazing stuff. Rather reminds me of an aniumal having been backed into a corner. Another pipes up in the same thread:      This feels like it's the beginning of the end for us.  He's wrong, of course. The beginning of the end was accomplished quite a while ago.... as the first message demonstrates.  What perhaps put this even further into Mr Bush's court, though was his remarks at the dinner: (bolds are my own)         "Thank you. I was just looking for a warm meal somewhere. Thank you for inviting me to dinner. General Sanchez, thank you, sir, for your kind invitation and your strong leadership. Ambassador Bremer, thank you for your steadfast belief in freedom and peace. I want to thank the members of the Governing Council who are here, pleased you are joining us on our nation's great holiday, it's a chance to give thanks to the Almighty for the many blessings we receive.      I'm particularly proud to be with the 1st Armored Division, the 2nd ACR, the 82nd Airborne. I can't think of a finer group of folks to have Thanksgiving dinner with than you all. We're proud of you. Today, Americans are gathering with their loved ones to give thanks for the many blessings in our lives. And this year we are especially thankful for the courage and the sacrifice of those who defend us, the men and women of the United States military.      I bring a message on behalf of America: We thank you for your service, we're proud of you, and America stands solidly behind you. Together, you and I have taken an oath to defend our country. You're honoring that oath. The United States military is doing a fantastic job. You are defeating the terrorists here in Iraq, so that we don't have to face them in our own country. You're defeating Saddam's henchmen, so that the people of Iraq can live in peace and freedom.      By helping the Iraqi people become free, you're helping change a troubled and violent part of the world. By helping to build a peaceful and democratic country in the heart of the Middle East, you are defending the American people from danger and we are grateful.      You're engaged in a difficult mission. Those who attack our coalition forces and kill innocent Iraqis are testing our will. They hope we will run. We did not charge hundreds of miles into the heart of Iraq, pay a bitter cost in casualties, defeat a brutal dictator and liberate 25 million people only to retreat before a band of thugs and assassins.      We will prevail. We will win because our cause is just. We will win because we will stay on the offensive. And we will win because you're part of the finest military ever assembled. And we will prevail because the Iraqis want their freedom.      Every day you see firsthand the commitment to sacrifice that the Iraqi people are making to secure their own freedom. I have a message for the Iraqi people: You have an opportunity to seize the moment and rebuild your great country, based on human dignity and freedom. The regime of Saddam Hussein is gone forever.      The United States and our coalition will help you, help you build a peaceful country so that your children can have a bright future. We'll help you find and bring to justice the people who terrorized you for years and are still killing innocent Iraqis. We will stay until the job is done. I'm confident we will succeed, because you, the Iraqi people, will show the world that you're not only courageous, but that you can govern yourself wisely and justly.      On this Thanksgiving, our nation remembers the men and women of our military, your friends and comrades who paid the ultimate price for our security and freedom. We ask for God's blessings on their families, their loved ones and their friends, and we pray for your safety and your strength, as you continue to defend America and to spread freedom.      Each one of you has answered a great call, participating in an historic moment in world history. You live by a code of honor, of service to your nation, with the safety and the security of your fellow citizens. Our military is full of the finest people on the face of the earth. I'm proud to be your commander in chief. I bring greetings from America. May God bless you all."  The response to his showing up was thunderous applause, both in the hall, and here at home. "It's got to be a lonely moment for them," said the President. "I thought it was important to send that message that we care for them (the troops) and we support them strongly, that we erase any doubts in their minds as to whether or not the people stand with them."  He also said, correctly "  Having seen the reaction of those troops, you know it was the right thing to do."  Given the response at home, it was the right thing to do on that score, as well. This trip did several things:  It got Michael Jackson off the front page, at least until the press figured out there was no way to spin this negative for the president.  Much as some in the press bicthewd and moaned about not being told about his trip, it showed clearly that most people here at home approve of the President not telling the press his every move. One could extrapolate that a bit and take the suggestion that the President has more trust in the end, than the press does.  It upstaged Hitlery's trip, basically keeping her off the screens... given her trip, she couldn't even bitch about Bush's trip. It should not have, however. Look what she pulls: In what must have been a demoralizing message to U.S. soldiers she told them that Americans back home are growing increasingly skeptical of President Bush's decision to send them into battle. What a moron.  It answered all those who figured we're going to cut and run.  It made a rather clear demonstration of the differences between an administrator and a leader. Nobody since Reagan and to a lesser degree, Bush Sr., understood this difference. It's clear by the polling data, however, that the American people, including his opposition, understand  the difference.

       I mentioned a while ago on BITSBLOG an attempt by the UN to gain control of the Internet. The Blog note, which linked a FOXNEWS article just barely scratched the surface of the topic. The story suggests that the stated goal of such control would be to tie 'emerging' nations (read that, "the poor") more directly to the net, at the expense of the rest of us.  One other problem of turning control of the 'net over to the UN is that it will make the internet less effective.  The obvious example is the way that body has managed to show complete irrelevancy in the recent Iraq conflict. Iraq is hardly the only example of the UN's impotency, merely the most recent.  Perhaps it should be no shock to anyone that the biggest backer of the proposal is China. You remember them; they're the ones who have been placing more controls on their own people's internet access than any other country on the planet, as an active political action, and who stands to gain more than any other besides perhaps Cuba, by some socialist leaning body maintaining a grip on the internet access of the rest of us, to say nothing of our free expression thereon.     I think most people would find it hard to fathom that China could be backing proposals whose stated goals run so directly afoul of their own past behavior.  And yes, it should be noted that exact definitions at this stage are hard to come by. But I submit this is part of the design. It's the same trick the left uses here in the States; be sufficiently vague about your goals and use high-sounding phrases so as to gather support. Once that particular snowball is rolling damn few will be able to stop it.  And, let's also say that in truth here is much in the way of clues as to what all this is about.  Consider their own press release, which states in part:      "Freedom of the press entails responsibilities. As new technologies allow unprecedented freedom to the “new media” on the Internet, these should not be used to foster intolerance and hatred. Instead, the values of tolerance, dialogue and respect for diversity must be the foundations of a truly inclusive global information society. The information society should bring the world together instead of adding new divisions, creating a more just and harmonious global environment."  Ah, yes... High sounding words. So very open and inclusive... and condescending. Let's remember what Canada did under the guise of such words... Hate Speech laws, under which, for example,  passages from the Bible regarding homosexual behavior is 'hate speech'. Funny how that little "HATE BUSH" party out in LA a few weeks ago, isn't regarded in international leftist circles as 'Hate Speech", huh? Remember also that the United Nations has recently determined that some forms of "hate speech" can actually be war crimes. Starting to get the picture?  In case you were unaware, the US is the birthplace of the internet, and always has been, even if you believe the claim of Al Gore that he invented the thing. The internet is very much American in that it's free speech on all channels all the time. The Internet is in the final read, exporting Americanism.  This proposal would put a stop to all of that. How? Simple.  Just read Article 29 Section 3 of the proposal:      "These rights and freedoms may in no case be exercised contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations."  The translation is that your freedom of speech, your freedom of expression, and your free exchange of information and opinion cannot be exercised if such runs afoul of the "purposes and principles of the United Nations".  As to what that purpose is, let's be real, here. The UN has only one purpose... blanket opposition to anything the US does.  No wonder the Chinese are the biggest backers of this proposal... no wonder the UN as a whole is pushing this; They won't be able to deal with the freedom. Can you imagine, for example China, or Cuba, dealing with free speech? Why, they might even have people that are critical of the communist governments there. Can't have that!  Need I remind anyone that among the first thing the recently freed Iraqi people wanted to do was to involve themselves in the internet, to access US sites?  They also go on to suggest they are about solving the pressing issues intellectual property protection and of Internet crime. They do though manage to get the usual code words in, though, about utilizing new technologies to overcome poverty and find ways to make Internet access "affordable to all".   Meaning, the US is, under this plan going to have to find some way to pay for this grandiose plan of theirs.  But it gets worse than this.  Consider; What would places like China, India, and many African nations,  gain by such central control? A look at Taiwan is a good start toward your answer; it's the best way I can think of to leap over copyright laws to gain a financial foothold. Think your neighbor's MP3 collection's an issue? Wait till this nonsense gets placed into international law.. and music won't even be on the list of financial problem areas regards the net and piracy!  The internet is an invention designed around freedom; the UN, both in the specific proposal regards the internet, and as a whole, runs counter to that stated purpose. Turning control of it over to them is foolish at best, and in truth self-destructive for America, and the world.

      1214031228-Rochester, NY--  Well, it's happened. We got Saddam. We got the man who boasted about the number of people he'd killed:        "George Bush believes he is so powerful, so strong," Saddam said. "But even with all of his bombs and missiles and Marines, he has not even come close to killing as many Iraqis as I did."  Indeed; the evidence is mounting that those who died at the hands of Saddam, or those acting at his order, number in the millions. So much for the claims of the Baathist nuts, and their sympathizers here in the states who claimed this was a war not on terrorism, but on Islam. Weren't the people Saddam is boasting of Killing, followers of Islam?  Clearly, this is a massive victory for the Iraqi people. Equally clearly, this is a massive vindication for the Administration's policies.  What may be less clear to some, is the effect it will have here in the states, politically speaking. The domestic ramifications will take a while to identify, but there are a few we know about already.  A few offhanded examples: Hitlery was due to speak at the Council on Foreign Relations. Hitlery, who has of course been critical of our actions, was reportedly set t fire a massive broadside at Mr. Bush, apparently setting the stage for a Presidential run.    Howard "Duck" Dean, who has been taking a course vis-à-vis Mr. Bush, not unlike that of Hitlery, was also due for a major policy speech in LA on Monday.   Imagine with me, the furious re-writes going on, as the staff of both The Duck and Hitlery as they try to alter their positions to allow for reality, all without looking like they didn't want this day to come to pass.  No statement from Hitlery as of this writing. However, she's not in a good position at all. After her badwill tour of Bagram,  where she badmouthed the chain of command, is less than 2 weeks was proven to be a total idiot..  The Duck, for his part, in his statement this morning, earns his nickname, by ducking what would have happened had we actually followed his advise of 'duck and cover" regards Iraq; Saddam would still be in power.  More, The Duck in his statement this morning, said in part:      "Now that the dictator is captured, we must also accelerate the transition from occupation to full Iraqi sovereignty."   Dean, in this insistence on push9ing all of this back into the hands of Iraqis... seems to want to ignore the advise of the vast majority of people, best exemplified by Newsweek columnist Fareed Zakaria.  Zakaria says in a column published  November 4th in the Washington Post that  "Iraqification" —the quick transfer of power to local troops and politicians in Iraq—is an exit strategy, not a winning strategy. And this losing strategy, tantamount to placing a load on the foundation before the cement is dry, thus dooming the building to total collapse, is exactly what Dean wanted.  That particular argument is a moot point now, of course, except for the question of how Dean and his supporters could be so spectacularly and demonstrably wrong on this issue. And perhaps of greater import for the future, what is their basic thinking on world events that would drive them to be so flat-out wrong?  Certainly, such ideas would lead them to be so again in future... and if given political power, they'd drag US down the chute towards destruction, along with them.  Dean, in the end, has, along with most of the rest of the Democrats, nothing but his hatred of Bush, and his raw powerlust, left to run on, now. Watch for them to become even more loudmouthed as their defenses disappear.  Some other notable reactions:      "Praise the Lord. ... This is a day of glory for the American military, American intelligence, and it's a day of triumph and joy for anybody in the world who cares about freedom and human rights and peace." — Sen. Joe Lieberman  D-Conn.      "For 35 years, the people of Iraq suffered under the rule of one of the most cruel and vicious tyrants in the history of the world. His capture puts a period to the statement that says the Saddam Hussein era is ended." — Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.      "Capturing Saddam Hussein and ensuring that this brutal dictator will never return to power is an important step toward stabilizing Iraq for the Iraqis. Let's also be clear: Our problems in Iraq have not been caused by one man and this is a moment when the administration can and must launch a major effort to gain international support and win the peace." — Sen. John Kerry  D-Mass.      "This is a major, major step, a remarkable day for the world." — Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist R-Tenn.      "I supported this effort in Iraq without regard for the political consequences because it was the right thing to do. I still feel that way now and today is a major step toward stabilizing Iraq and building a new democracy." — Rep. Dick Gephardt D-Mo.  And now perhaps we know why the Democrats haven't taken Gephardt seriously.... because he was right, in this, at least. I wonder how that will play.  Other ramifications that pop into mind:  * The Morale of the military has to be sky high, even overcoming the cloud of doom imposed by Hitlery's recent bad will tour of Bagram.  * The economy here is about to really take off come Monday morning. Says the AP:      "In fact, analysts believe Saddam's capture will give a general boost to equities around the globe, as well as to the U.S. dollar and U.S. Treasuries.      "It's broadly positive for equity markets," said Hilary Cook, director of investment strategy at Barclays Stockbrokers. "Concerns over the situation in Iraq have weighed on sentiment and help explain why shares haven't rallied by as much as they could have in the face of some pretty positive economic data."      So U.S. troops' capture of Saddam, who was found hiding in a hole near his home town of Tikrit, could give the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average reason to extend last week's gains above the psychologically sensitive 10,000 mark."         * This will work to eliminate what little doubt there was about our capturing Bin Laden, in due course.  * Al Gore, who has been screaming for Dean louder than Dean was about how bad the war is,  just a few days ago, now sees his house of cards collapse.  * All these factors must have the Democrats in a real funk this morning, because their disloyal opposition will be remembered as the failing policy it is.   * Ramsey Clark, the paid traitor, isn't even on the radar.  * Oh, and the WMD's?  Does anyone think that he won't be telling us about those, now that he's been captured?  *With all of this, it's clear that the President's re-election has just been cemented.  -0-

      122103203203-Rochester, NY  A number of years ago, one of the justifications of getting involved in Vietnam was what was known as the Domino effect. In that case, the problem was seen that if we allowed Vietnam to fall under Communist domination, that one by one, all the nation-states of the region would also fall under communism.  Update to December 2003. President Bush has been saying for months that the removal of Saddam from power would not only help the Iraqi people, but would also start a domino effect in the region. We remove the Taliban, we remove Saddam, and woosh.... here comes Quack-Daffy, telling us he's going to disarm.  The latest domino falls, and this one didn't require a shot. Just as the President called it. Hmm.  As best I can tell the evidence is now irrefutable that the President's way of handling this situation is the correct one...  The resulting press is interesting, and telling. Even the usually leftist press is being forced to concede that Mr. Bush has been doing it right, after all.     A few examples:  Says CNN:      "Libya has declared its intention to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction and to limit the range of Libyan missiles to no greater than 300 kilometers," Blair said, adding that the Libyan leader has agreed "that this process will be transparent and verifiable."      Libya also agreed to adhere to international agreements on chemical weapons and sign an additional protocol with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the nuclear watchdog group.      "This decision by Colonel Gadhafi is an historic one and a courageous one, and I applaud it," Blair said. "It will make the region and the world more secure."  National Website of Wales which said in part:      "War in Iraq helped secure Libya's agreement to give up its weapons of mass destruction programmes"  British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon Told Sky News, recently:      "I don't think you can separate out the relevance of military action in Iraq from the decision the Libyans have taken.      "We showed, after Saddam Hussein had failed to co-operate with the UN, that we meant business and Libya - and I hope other countries - will draw that lesson."  The Japanese outlet, Asahi.com agrees, saying:      "Some observers believe that the use of military force against Iraq by the United States and Britain was also read as a warning to Libya, with that action paving the way to the current negotiations. It seems plausible that such a threat was one influence on Tripoli's decision to come clean."  The Scottsman says pretty much the same:      "...nevertheless, the toppling of Saddam will not have been unhelpful in concentrating minds, both on the decision to abandon weapons of mass destruction and on the agreement to sign up to UN nuclear arms inspections. Such negotiations could have dragged on for many more months and years without yielding anything so dramatic as the developments of the past two days. It was perhaps no coincidence that Gaddafi approached Britain and the United States in March, at the very time when Saddam was being driven from power."  Larger yet is the report from The Daily Times in Pakistan that with these agreements, comes also, intelligence on hundreds of Al Qaeda and other Islamic militants. Hundreds of terrorists have already been given up by Libya.   Given that there are ties between Bin Laden's group and Libya, it should not, perhaps be overly shocking to find that Libya's capitulation on the matter was apparently based on actions taken by the US, which in turn were started based on information apparently obtained by the capturing of Saddam.  The timing and some of the indications all seem to line up to that conclusion, at least as of this writing.  And what will France do, I wonder? Wasn't it France who tried to over-rule and negate the agreement with Libya last August, over the Flight 103 incident?  Reuters reports that:       France said on Sunday the United States told it months ago it was talking with Libya about giving up banned weapons, dismissing talk that Paris was frozen out because of its opposition to the U.S.-led war in Iraq.      Defense Minister Michele Alliot-Marie said France was kept informed of discussions between Washington, London and Tripoli which culminated in a surprise announcement on Friday that Libya was giving up its banned weapons programs.  Amazing. Sounds like these French have been taking lessons at the feet of one Bill Clinton... who has a habit of resisting to the last, and then when the situation gets out of his control, and what he was resisting finally happens anyway, he'd get out front and claim it was his idea all along. (Take, welfare reform as an example.) Even at this, however, even the French are being forced to admit progress in spite of, not because of their efforts at holding back the US. Says Foreign Minister Dominique de Villepin:      "We are seeing the emergence, after what has been achieved in Iran and in Libya, of a coherent and willful international approach to tackle the problem of proliferation, which is essential for the safety of our societies."  I suppose the French to be playing along now, but should,be fully trusted... rather like Smeagol of the Lord of the Rings fame. They clearly have an agenda of their own and are still trying to steer matters. Whatever else is happening, however, that particular dog has been successfully called to heel for the moment.  Meanwhile, North Korea is keeping rather quiet about these developments in Libya, and says the Korean Times:      "The reclusive country's state media is also silent on the capture of former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and Iran's possible acceptance of comprehensive inspections of its nuclear facilities.      U.S. President George W. Bush voiced his hope Saturday that North Korean leader Kim Jong-il would accept international inspections for weapons of mass destruction, as has Libya done."  This situation seems to also speaks rather loudly as to the effectiveness of the UN in controlling nuclear arms. Consider; that Libya has found itself in need of de-arming means it was armed... for years... with Nuclear weapons banned under the  Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty they were a signatory to. So much for the arguments about trusting the UN to deal with such matters. And so much also, for the malcontents here at home in the US trying to direct us toward the UN running the show. This situation shows that was a Nuclear attack waiting to happen.  But it didn't because the current occupant of the White House not only has some testicular fortitude the one he replaced did not, but also one that is a student of history.  History shows clearly treaties don't keep the peace... the only path to peace in this world is the judicious use of military force. Mr. Bush and his administration have the wit to see this truth, and are reaping the benefits of a possibly more peaceful world as a result of that truth, and it's resulting policy.  But of course the nine dwarves  here in the States won't like it. Particularly Dean, whose idiotic insistence that all this doesn't help our security at home, is going to be hanging over his head for the rest of his life.  In the very near term, he may be right, in terms of the possibility of further attacks against America and the west, as the Islamofacists get more desperate. Like any cornered dog, they're likely to lash out with what they have left. (This, I suspect is the thinking behind the Orange alert as this is written.) Nobody, however, can deny that in the long term, we're going to be better off.  And think; all it took was standing up to a couple tyrants. Do that and like Dominos, all the rest fall in line. Amazing what happens when you have a leader, isn't it?

      010104224728-- Niagara Falls, NY-- Happy New Year.  We're up in Niagara Falls tonight, for the fireworks display at midnight. We're actually not far from where I've written columns in the past.  They have two shows tonight. As this is written, it's between shows, and we're waiting for the Midnight show. We've already seen the one scheduled at 9:15 (though they actually went up at about 9:25). The Midnight show is supposed to be quite something; They'll shoot fireworks off the top of the Skylon tower AND up out of the Niagara river gorge.   At moments like this one tends to wonder what lies ahead, and since I have the time, I may as well jot some notes down.  Within this context, then, here's my predictions for 2004, in no particular order:         *        Lord of the Rings Return of the King will be nominated for picture of the year, and will lose.     *        The Democrats will swing so far left in search of primary voters, they will be easy targets during the general election     *        Yet more links will be revealed between Saddam and Bin Laden, and the left will try to deny such revelations are of any import.     *        More links between Saddam and Syria, as regards Saddam's weapons programs will be found and the left will try to deny such revelations are of any import. These denials will be ignored, given the obvious.     *        Howard Dean will win the Democrat nomination.     *        Following that convention, polling data will show Howard Dean with less than 40% of the support in a general election.     *        Hilary Clinton, who wants Dean nowhere near the leadership of the party,  will try to step in at the last minute to supposedly "save the situation". Her greed will be shown and understood at last... even by the Democrats.     *        Despite this, and in fact because of it, to a large degree, George W. Bush will win a second term as President with around 60% of the popular vote.     *        Tony Blair will face an election, and will win again.     *        Nancy Pelosi will be a disaster for Democrats in the '04 election cycle, particularly in the south, where Republicans will pick up more seats, and governorships.     *        The Democrats will scream about how polarized politics has become, as the majority moves to the Republicans. It's only way they can explain away their losses.     *        "The 2004 election campaigns will break a record in money spent on elections, but a little noted factor will be how much of that money did not come from PACs and corporations, but from everyday people... which is a ratification of President Bush's policies... and that grassroots movement, that majority will be the biggest push toward the Republican electoral victory in '04.     *        The situation in Iraq will continue on it's course of steady improvement. Of course the Democrats will deny it's an improvement, and we'll see occasional statements that we were better off with Saddam.     *        To the dismay of the un-American left, Bin Laden will be captured in mid-summer.     *        Bills and proposals regarding homosexual 'unions' will become a political 'third rail' as polls will report 70% percent of Americans against allowing them despite decades of attempts to change that situation.     *        Given court rulings allowing any two persons to "marry" we'll see the ACLU come out in support of the legalization and normalization of all kinds of kinks, including bestiality and necrophilia, incest, polygamy, pedophilia, and so on. They will argue that such restrictions are unconstitutional, and will use the pro-homosexual rulings as their basis for motion.     *        The long awaited "liberal radio network' will be near stillborn, being heard on lower power and "rimshot" stations only, in the few markets it manages to get into. It will die quietly inside two years.     *        Dow at or above 12,000. So great will be the growth of the economy, in fact, that the Fed will be forced to react with increased prime rates.     *        As an indication as well as an outgrowth of that fact, IT spending will skyrocket and the IT services field will see large growth. This spending will more a more careful spending than we saw in the 90's, since we won't have the 2000 bug to worry about, but will instead focus on the ROI for each company.     *        Linux will increase it's hold on the desktop.     *        As bandwidth gets cheaper, we'll see higher and higher speed internet connections at the home desktop level. This trend is actually already established, but will continue exponentially.     *        AOL/Time Warner will split in '04, leaving AOL to boil in it's own juices for a short time, before AOL gets swallowed up by some other ISP, and the AOL shell will die the death it's deserved for decades.     *        Voice over IP will become a household phrase, and will clearly demonstrate that government regulation hobbles development. Calls will begin to be made to eliminate such regulation. Democrats will of course fight it. May not be resolved in '04, but the path will be clear by '05.     *        George Soros will no longer be the 38th richest man in America, but will fail in unseating Mr. Bush.     *        Castro dies. The end of communism is in sight on Cuba.     *        By year's end the number of states that will have enacted conceal-carry permit laws, will be at or above 40. The associated drop in crime will be ignored by the leftists, who will be suffering apoplexy about how 'wild west' things have gotten. (Disconnection from reality is a safe bet for the left in ANY year, after all.)     * There will continue to be an amusing struggle among  Democrats seeking to describe the recently passed drug bill as corporate welfare for the drug companies, when despite their protests, it's exactly what they've been pushing for decades.  By the way; here's a link to the display we saw at Midnight

      011004105112-Rochester, NY---  One of the biggest arguments over the last few years, on the opinion pages and on Usenet, and more recently in the Blog responders, tends to pop up when the name of Hitler is invoked as a standard for comparison. The usual leftist mantra runs that when we compare (insert Hillary here) to Hitler, ala "Hitlery", it's a sure sign that the person doing such comparisons is running out of valid points, and has certainly lost both the argument and any credibility inside or outside of said discussion.  So here comes The George Soros hit squad called MOVEON, with it's recent competition, wherein they posted ads from their followers making exactly that comparison.  MOVEON, of course is swearing they didn't know, they're not responsible, they regret not having caught the ads before they made it to the site, and so on. MoveOn.org spokesman Trevor Fitzgibbon said, "we had no idea the Hitler thing even existed."  So, what rock have you been living under, Trevor? Have you even been reading the output of your rank and file supporters? Have you even been actually reading your own website?  A look in alt.politics will give you the clue... Even a shallow search of Google's Usenet portal displays hundreds of thousands of posts and their replies, most going back years. A similar search on the web pages shows an even larger number of hits. I find it hard to fathom that a group of people so centered on the net wouldn't know this kind of non-thinking was out there. Sorry, this innocent act doesn't wash. This is Soros driving this.  If you think Hitler comparison is not part and parcel of the Democrats and their political smear campaign, ask yourself a question: Which one of the nine wannabees will stand up and speak out against the trend that's been noted here?  None, I expect. We've not seen them do so yet, and I doubt there will be any. No, the silence on this one will remain. The reason for their silence is clear enough; They think they benefit from it,  or at the least, they think denouncing these tactics will harm them with the core Democrat voter.  OK, admittedly, those are just the leaders of the party, and may not reflect the views of the Democrat rank and file. So, lets test that aspect, by asking a similar question.  Where are the Democrat rank and file speaking out on the news channels, and in the public forums? Where are the letters of protest? There are few; because so many of them don't disagree with the portrayal of Bush as worse than Hitler. And more, is it just a relative few who are generating all this internet traffic making this absurd comparison?   No, the silence on this one from the Democrat rank and file, too, will remain.  This collective silence from the whole of the Democrat party speaks volumes, I think.  I've brought these points up in various discussion groups over the last few days, and have been told  on a few occasions that I'm letting a few radicals define the Democrat party.  Aside from balking at the phrase 'a few'. let me submit that leftist radicalism IS the Democrat party of today.  The argument is easy to make and hard to defeat, because words mean things. Allow me to point out that 'radical' is from words meaning, literally, "from the root'. I don't think it can be denied that the ads under discussion here, are if nothing else, radical left, and given the definition of the word radical, they demonstrate clearly where the roots of the Democrat party are today.  Here's a few examples of Democrat rank and file:  http://hatebush.hilaration.com/enter.shtml  http://altahemp.com/bushnazi.html  http://sandiego.indymedia.org/en/2003/04/5626.shtml  (Be forewarned, the last one is particularly weird.)  There are of course thousands more examples of this kind of Democrat hate, and proof of where it comes from.  But here's the bottom line: Even if you assume MOVEON's innocence in the matter...(a large unwarranted assumption, in my view) this incident still exposes what is driving the left. Sheer hatred, and nothing more, even by their own definitions. I've said this for years, for all the lip service they pay to 'stopping hate'...with them it's not that you hate, or not, but what you hate. This is not love of country driving these people, it's hatred for it. This is desperation in search of a path back to power.  One can certainly understand their motivations, here. Consider their plight;  President Bush has Iraq fully in hand, and we now know where the WMD are, (Syria) that the left has been claiming Mr. Bush was lying about. Here's the Blog entry I did a few days ago, containing lots of links to stories the left hopes you'll never see.  The Afghan people have a new constitution, (another story you didn't know about, thanks to our supposedly mainstream press) and the Taliban, what there is left of them, are on the run. Their supports removed, the PLO is no longer a major factor. Libya has fallen into line. Korea, as well.    On the domestic front, President Bush has managed to get a drug bill into law that the left has never been able to, even when they held power in all three branches, by a wider margin than the Republicans do today, indicating the success rates they'll have at getting the job done when given more of a majority. Bush also has the Domestic economy flying high, the markets are sailing along as they have not done since Ronald Reagan was in office.  Look at the numbers for the last year: DJIA 	+25.3% S&P 500 +26.4% Nasdaq 	+50.0%   Jobless rates are coming back down, pay is going up, productivity is also going up. The states are back out of the financial trouble they were in under Bill Clinton.  Speaking of which, the American public need not be concerned anymore about their president having the sexual behavior of the average stray terrier, humping every leg that comes by.  In the overall, respect for the office has now been reinstated, and Americans are feeling pretty good about their country.  As a result, the polls are continuing to show Mr. Bush with sky-high approval ratings, week on week on week.  All these trends are looking like they will continue to improve, with Bush at the helm.  Here's the rub for the Democrats in all of this. In any election, the task set before anyone seeking to oust an incumbent, is to convince the voting public that moving away from the incumbent and his policies, are in the interests of that voting public, and the country as a whole. So, the Democrats are desperate because, bluntly, their task of explaining to the voter why replacing the man responsible for all this good news, is in their best  interest, is getting ever more impossible, and frankly downright laughable. All the Democrats can offer is moves away from what is demonstrably working well. In short, they're hoping the American voter is stupid.  But, from now on, when you hear about this MOVEON outrage, this Hitler/Bush being pushed by George Soros and tolerated by the Democrat leaders and agreed with by the Democrat rank and file, you need to think about this:   If we're to take them at their word of just a few short Monica kneepad sessions ago, they're telling us, they're running out of options, and have certainly lost both the argument and any credibility inside or outside of said discussion.  And, they most certainly don't deserve our vote.

      011704132726...Rochester NY---  Let's start out with basic fact: The Democrats are electoral trouble... serious electoral trouble. The polling data over the last six months and longer clearly and consistently places President Bush several dozen percentage points over any rival the Democrats can come up with, including Hillary Clinton.  So you can imagine their glee when Paul O'Neill stepped into the spotlight, having been pushed by Ron Suskind. The book Suskind wrote “The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill.” must have seemed the right tool at the right time. The press, dealing with small news cycles in Iraq, and the ungodly boring events in Iowa... which everyone suspects will in the end be meaningless, was looking for some spark, and hoping they could fan it into a flame to burn down the Presidency of one George W. Bush. O'Neill looked to be the match to star this fire.  It amazes me... the short memory that the left has. It was just two short years ago that he was the brunt of jokes from the left. Now suddenly they take him seriously. Why? Because he's giving them something to chew on other than their own recent failings.  Immediately,  and predictably, the leftist hacks started working on out of context and twisted quotes from Mr. O'Neill.  Said one such hack:      "Like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people." That certainly captured my attention: DUH-Be-Ya's own ex-secretary of the Treasury describing Baby Bush's clueless demeanor at a Cabinet meeting."  But was it really so?  No, this is leftist dominated news media twists, because what O'Neill really said was that HE felt like "Like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people.", not that Mr. Bush was acting that way.   He was complaining, in short, that he felt disconnected from the processes of the White House.   Let's look at the bigger lines the Democrats and the press (A redundancy) seized upon:  *  O'Neill had seen no evidence of WMD in Iraq, and from day one the Bush Administration was hell-bent on deposing Saddam.  Well, it didn't take too much thinking to notice a little problem... O'Neill is complaining he's out of the loop and yet we're supposed to take his seeing no evidence of WMD to mean that WMD do not exist in Iraq?  * The Bush administration from Day one, wanted Saddam out of power and was willing to do what it needed to do to make that happen.  Ted Kennedy made a speech the other day, trying to sell the same dishwater: That Mr. Bush had made the whole thing up the act was illegal, and so on. The Democrats are focused like a laser on this point because they know it to be their only hope to regain power.  Well, perhaps Democrats have shorter memories than the rest of us, or perhaps they're just not wanting to tell us the truth.  But I seem to recall something called the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998, which was passed by the house with a large majority, and unanimously by the Senate. Meaning Kennedy voted for regime change in Iraq, in 1998. He may have been drunk at the time, and may not remember it, but he voted for it. The act as passed and signed into law by President Clinton declares that it should be the policy of the United States to seek to remove the Saddam Hussein regime from power in Iraq and to replace it with a democratic government.  So, it appears Mr. Bush was obeying the law. If we're to believe with the Democrats, that all this is Mr. Bush's doing, we also then think, as the Colorado Conservative notes in his blog, that      "....Bush is SOOOOO Evil that he was able to enact regime change in Iraq TWO YEARS BEFORE HE WAS ELECTED. FOUR YEARS BEFORE THE ACTUAL WAR"  I should also point up that one complaint from the left was that Bush went into Iraq with no plan. Now he's tried  and convicted in the press of doing what the Democrats wanted...following a pre-set, well thought out plan... in fact he was planning it all along. Which way are they going with this?  But let's look closer at this claim of President Bush making it all up, let's look at what the Congress had to say on the point, also by way of Colorado's site:       The Congress makes the following findings:     (1) On September 22, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, starting an 8 year war in which Iraq employed chemical weapons against Iranian troops and ballistic missiles against Iranian cities.      (2) In February 1988, Iraq forcibly relocated Kurdish civilians from their home villages in the Anfal campaign, killing an estimated 50,000 to 180,000 Kurds.      (3) On March 16, 1988, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurdish civilian opponents in the town of Halabja, killing an estimated 5,000 Kurds and causing numerous birth defects that affect the town today.      (4) On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded and began a 7 month occupation of Kuwait, killing and committing numerous abuses against Kuwaiti civilians, and setting Kuwait's oil wells ablaze upon retreat.      (5) Hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on February 28, 1991, and Iraq subsequently accepted the ceasefire conditions specified in United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (April 3, 1991) requiring Iraq, among other things, to disclose fully and permit the dismantlement of its weapons of mass destruction programs and submit to long-term monitoring and verification of such dismantlement.      (6) In April 1993, Iraq orchestrated a failed plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his April 14-16, 1993, visit to Kuwait.      (7) In October 1994, Iraq moved 80,000 troops to areas near the border with Kuwait, posing an imminent threat of a renewed invasion of or attack against Kuwait.      (8) On August 31, 1996, Iraq suppressed many of its opponents by helping one Kurdish faction capture Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government.      (9) Since March 1996, Iraq has systematically sought to deny weapons inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) access to key facilities and documents, has on several occasions endangered the safe operation of UNSCOM helicopters transporting UNSCOM personnel in Iraq, and has persisted in a pattern of deception and concealment regarding the history of its weapons of mass destruction programs.      (10) On August 5, 1998, Iraq ceased all cooperation with UNSCOM, and subsequently threatened to end long-term monitoring activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency and UNSCOM.      (11) On August 14, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law 105-235, which declared that `the Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations' and urged the President `to take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations.'.      (12) On May 1, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law 105-174, which made $5,000,000 available for assistance to the Iraqi democratic opposition for such activities as organization, training, communication and dissemination of information, developing and implementing agreements among opposition groups, compiling information to support the indictment of Iraqi officials for war crimes, and for related purposes.  You can perhaps understand why this point of O'Neill's about this being the first priority of the Bush Administration fell off the newspaper front pages rather quickly... Almost as quickly as the bit about the lack of evidence of WMD.  Indeed, the Democrats, and thereby, the news media, have dropped all references to Paul O'Neill. As this is written, it's Saturday afternoon, and the Sunday Morning news show schedules are still pretty much in flux. However, I'm willing to bet that nobody makes any mention of him at all. Apparently, they sense that they got caught, and they're not about to risk more exposure. As I glance through the various wire services this morning, I can find no reference to Mr. O'Neill at all, more recent than the morning of January 15th.  Some Democrats are wondering what hit them, today. Others are loudly suggesting (sans  evidence, of course) that O'Neill was intimidated by the Bush Administration into silence.  Well, you just knew the Democrats were going to try to say that Bush was silencing a Whistle- Blower, rather than they'd overstated their case, and stretched O'Neill's intent, didn't you, really? I have some serious doubts on that score, however. First, because such facts would soon get out to a press desperate to effect the removal of Mr. Bush from office.   Secondly, Mr. O'Neil is a hard bitten businessman, with plenty of financial resources of his own to bring into play, and at this stage of his life, little to lose. This is a guy known to have gone toe to toe with Vice President Dick Cheney in the past. I doubt Rove would have much effect on him.  But still for at least a while, the speculation kept coming from the left as regards why the sudden change on the part of Mr. O'Neill. Chief among the speculations, was that Mr. Bush had clamped down on a whistle-blower.  Think about it; what else are they going to say? They've been trying to say all along that Bush made up the whole Iraq conflict... and nothing else they could have said in this O'Neill situation would have aided their larger case. In fact, saying anything else...anything, exposes them to how badly overstated the left's case on this point really is. And what does O'Neill himself say on the matter? Asked if he thought the internal Treasury probe was a get-even move by the administration, O'Neill replied      "I don't think so. If I were secretary of the treasury and these circumstances occurred, I would have asked the inspector general to look into it."  The silence from the left after this one took on monumental proportions. What they saw as one of the biggest weapons they had in this election, had blown up in their faces.  To further the point of how integral this attempted 'he made it up' story is to the Democrats, and how overstated it is, I refer again to Mr. Kennedy's speech of the other day, and the 1998 bill he voted for. I again refer to the series of MOVEON ads and gatherings, where this point is hammered at again and again. You remember those... the ones where Hitler gets invoked repeatedly.  The Democrats decided to use O'Neill for their own ends to spread this lie. They had to twist his words and intentions to do it, but no matter for that.  Thing is, O'Neill backfired on them, which I found amusing. For all the charges of how he's backtracking now, the fact is, he's not backtracking. He's simply telling the truth... something which apparently Suskind wouldn't let him do in the book, for reasons of his own. In short O'Neill's ghost-writer got out of control. Indeed, he's on record as stating he 'probably' would vote for Mr. Bush for a second term, adding that      "'I don't see anyone who is better prepared or more capable"  One e-mail writer to my blog the other day put it very well:      "O'Neill now presents the picture of a man being manipulated for political gain by the Democrats and finally standing up for himself, and speaking for himself."  So, as a direct result of that truth telling, Mr. O'Neill's face is removed from the "News" papers and TV sets of the world to languish in the obscurity brought on by having revealed, even if unwittingly, how far the left and the press are willing to leave the truth behind, to regain their hold on American politics.     Now, as to Suskind himself, and his inability to tell the truth, well, that's the final straw.   Suskind claimed in the relentless promotion of this sham, that he has documents showing that preparations for the Iraq war were well underway before 9-11. He cited--and even showed--what he said was a Pentagon document, entitled, ’Foreign Suitors for Iraq Oilfield Contracts.’ He claimed the document was about planning for post-war Iraq oil.  While his assertion is correct, for the reasons I've already listed, his supposed proof is in fact a lie.  The document was in fact from the Vice- President’s Office, and was part of the Energy Project that was the focus of Dick Cheney’s attention before 9/11. It had no connection at all with the war effort but was, rather, part of a study of global oil supplies, of which Iraq was only a part.  Judicial Watch has it available.    Drudge in fact had the link up before the echo died on the initial story. (By the way, this is why the investigation by the Administration; not to chase O'Neill, but to disprove the claim.)  This O'Neill business, and the Democrats trying to use him as a tool against President Bush should put to rest the question of who is telling the truth on Iraq and a number of other matters.... but it won't. The reasons simple enough, and clearly seen by their actions over the last several months...; The Democrats clearly don't have anything but their anger and their lies to offer as reasons for their being elected.

         012504183137-- Rochester, NY -- &nbsp; With all of the attention being turned on&nbsp; John Kerry, perhaps it's time we examined him in some detail... and I don't mean his $90 plastic-looking haircuts. It's no secret that the majority of support for Kerry comes from people who don't know much about him, and from the hard left.      For all that John &quot;F'ing.&quot; Kerry likes to lay claim to his Vietnam vet status, apparently most vets don't take him as such. Remember where he spoke at the Vietnam Vets Memorial and the vets turned their backs on him, and walked away as he spoke?        Perhaps it was his publication called &quot;The New Soldier,&quot; the cover of which is a photograph of his ragged band of radicals mocking the U.S. Marine Corps Memorial, which depicts the flag-raising on Iwo Jima, with an upside-down American flag. When he wanted to run for election to the U.S. House in 1972, Kerry decided to suppress reproduction of the cover picture appearing on his own book. The cover is a rare look at this man, and to this day, he won't let it be published. I'll post it here however.             Perhaps it was his group; &quot;Vietnam Veterans Against the War&quot; one of the most unabashedly anti-American groups to come to life though the period. As an example, Kerry and his group were in Chicago to disrupt the '68 Democrat convention. This group was founded and funded by Hanoi Jane Fonda.     Says the Pittsburgh Tribune Review:          &quot;In the last week of April 1971, some 250,000   protesters were in Washington for massive protests against the draft and the war. They were preparing for their attack on the U.S.government on May 4, when they hoped to shut down the capital. Kerry was everywhere, now promoting the pro-communist People's Peace Treaty, drawn up in East Germany and developed by Tom Hayden and Rennie Davis. The treaty advocated the communist line to withdraw all U.S.troops from Vietnam and then negotiate with Hanoi for the release of our GIs who had been taken prisoner.&quot;         That same week,  urlLink Kerry testified before Congress, basically supporting the North Vietnamese dictatorship's positions..      &nbsp; urlLink The group continue be as far leftist as they were then today.  Consider their statements about the September 11th attacks and you'll begun to see just how far out of whack these people are.          &nbsp;    Then, there's the small matter of Kerry having supposedly tossed his medals over the White House Fence at an anti-war protest...     Should we have as President, someone who demonstrably gave aid and comfort to the enemy?     Chuck Noe, in writing an  urlLink exploratory of Kerry,  reports:       &quot;Sen. John McCain revealed that his North Vietnamese captors had used reports of Kerry-led protests to taunt him and his fellow prisoners.&quot;      But about those medals he supposedly tossed away in protest...     &nbsp;New York Times columnist Bill Keller apparently pressed Kerry at one point about whatever happened to those medals. Keller was apparently interested to&nbsp; find them still adorning his office wall. Keller, to my understanding, no longer works at the Times.&nbsp; Wonder why, huh?           Kerry's affinity with the Communists, apparently still exists even today. Noe also reports:          As chairman of the Select Senate Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, created in 1991 to investigate reports that U.S. prisoners of war and soldiers designated missing in action were still alive in Vietnam, Kerry badgered the panel into voting that no American servicemen remained in Vietnam.          “[N]o one in the United States Senate pushed harder to bury the POW/MIA issue, the last obstacle preventing normalization of relations with Hanoi, than John Forbes Kerry,” noted U.S. Veteran  Dipatch.        His affinity with the Communists is not limited to North Vietnam. According to an article no longer online at Slate:           “On May 19, 1994, five years after Tiananmen Square, Kerry spoke on the Senate floor against linking China's Most Favored Nation trade status to its human rights record.   ”        Consider the small matter of Mr. Kerry lobbying for renewed trade relations with Hanoi Now why would he do that?&nbsp; Records show that at the time,&nbsp; his cousin, one Stewart Forbes, chief executive for Colliers International,&nbsp; was busily putting the finishing touches on brokering a $905 million deal, trying to develop a deep-sea port at Vung Tau. Such relationships would in the past have raised howls from the left about 'sweetheart deals'        &nbsp;   More than granted, his service to this country when he was in uniform was worthwhile, and should be praised. But I am reminded of the old Janet Jackson tune:  &quot;What have you Done for me Lately?&quot;        Vietnam Vets Against Kerry states it as best anyone could:          &quot;Kerry's betrayal of American prisoners of war, his blatant disrespect for Vietnam veterans and the military, his support for communist Vietnam and his waffling over the issue of use of force in Iraq proves he cannot be relied on to protect the best interests of the United States. Although Kerry voted to support military intervention in Iraq he is now claiming that he only approved the threat of force by the United States.&quot;         Now any such individual would certainly be altogether unworthy of the trust needed to be our Commander-in-Chief. But do not be trapped into thinking that his stands on the military and on world socialism&nbsp; are the only ones problematic. There are other inconsistencies which do not involve his military service, but rather bring to light questions about his sanity or his patriotism, take your pick.     Let's take the CIA for example. After President Reagan succeeded in ending the Cold War, Kerry made lots of noise complaining about all the money being 'wasted' on the CIA... money he complained could be spent on domestic socialist programs. But when these cutbacks were viewed in the light of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, he complained about &quot;the gross lack of intelligence capability&quot;.      What of the Flight 800 shoot-down?&nbsp; Kerry has never bothered to explain to us why he not once but twice.... twice... referred on the air to TWA 800 as a terrorist act. More, he never once told us why his Senate Select Committee on Intelligence failed to mention TWA 800 at all in its 1996 or 1997 reports.      Kerry, being honest for a change, appeared on the Larry King show the evening of 9/11/01 urlLink  (transcript)  and said, in part:          &quot;We have always known this could happen.   We've warned about it. We've talked about it. I regret to say, as I served on   the Intelligence Committee up until last year, I can remember after the   bombings of the embassies, after TWA 800, we went through this flurry of   activity, talking about it, but not really doing [sic] hard work of   responding.&quot;         urlLink But John Cashill of World Net Daily reports that            ...on Sept. 20, 2001, one mainstream newspaper   broke the story of how the so-called Gore Commission failed conspicuously to   address airline safety. The paper claimed that this failure &quot;represents   the clearest recent public example of the success that airlines have long had   in defeating calls for more oversight.&quot;         The paper traced that failure to a series of campaign donations from the airlines to the Democratic National Committee in 1996 in the wake of the crash of TWA Flight 800, donations likely solicited by Al Gore himself. That newspaper just happened to be John Kerry's hometown Boston Globe.              Cashill also points up that Kerry made this reference again. Read the link.     Here it is: Kerry KNEW about the threats posed against us, KNEW Flight 800 was an act of terrorism. Yet, he not only covered the facts about 800 up, but also then proceeded to distort the facts as regards the terrorist threats against us once Mr. Bush was in office. All for his own political gain, and that of his party.     Can you imagine anything like this getting by when a Republican is the culprit?&nbsp; Why is the question not being asked: &quot;What did Kerry Know, and when did he know it?&quot;      Even fellow Democrats admit inconsistencies exist.&nbsp; Consider a recent New York Times write-up:          &quot;When it was popular to be a Massachusetts   liberal, his voting record was that,&quot; said Jay Carson, a Dean campaign   spokesman. &quot;When it was popular to be for the Iraq war, he was for it.   Now it's popular to be against it, and he's against it. This is a voting   record that is a big vulnerability against Republicans in the general   election. He's all over the place on this stuff.&quot;        I find it interesting that none of this has shown up in the press in the past few weeks; almost as if they're reluctant to question him on these points.    Because the press isn't doing it's job, I had to dig up all of this from older WebPages and reference works. It was pretty easy to find, including the pictures... all of it, from the dateline to the end line.     Thing is, such searches are nothing that the supposed mainstream press couldn't have done,   had they bothered.   They didn't.      Now, ask yourself;   Why?       You know why.

         020104214752- Rochester, NY     &nbsp;    Some more notes on Kerry, to add to what we already posted last week:     First, it's my guess is that we'll see a Kerry/Edwards run.     Kerry's too strong for Dean, and Edwards will be needed for the &quot;Southern Strategy.&quot;     In any event, Kerry will want no part of Dean who has demonstrated himself to be far too loopy as a running mate. (Consider the impact of that statement; Too loopy for Kerry?) Edwards doing well in Carolina will reinforce this idea with me.  Dean for his part, came up the other night on NightLine, with words to the effect that Iraq doesn't matter to the voters. Which, of course is nowhere near accurate. The voters... Even the Democrats... Don't like the strong anti-war stance Dean took. They don't like Kerry on the point, either, but at least Kerry has more going for him than anger. Not MUCH more, mind you.  Which leads us to a Bush Victory.       The reality is, as I pointed out last week, that Kerry has too much of a  urlLink negative history , even among Democrats, to not be full of holes by next  November.         &nbsp;   &nbsp;  Here's a few more little gotchas we will doubtless hear more about between now and November:      Think of it, Gang.... The 'party of the little guy' coughs up John Forbes Kerry, someone of money, who married into MORE money in the form of the heir to the Heinz fortune. Odd all by itself, but of course there's far more.      Kerry is someone whose only dealings with minorities is when he's in need of another drink at the country club. Someone who has never been a working man in his life. Someone who, when he pays taxes it's nothing more than a number; it never really affects his life in any substantial way... taxes don't even enter his world.  We're talking about someone here who was one of only 12 senators who voted against funding our troops in Iraq, and who voted for at least seven major reductions in defense and military spending and then claimed he was supporting our troops, and that he knows how to defend America.         We're talking about someone who voted repeatedly to slash the budgets of intelligence agencies by billions of dollars, and then on the night of 9/11 bitched loud and long about how our intel community failed us.  We're talking about someone who now claims to be for balancing the budget and yet who is on record has having voted against a Balanced Budget Amendment at least five times.  In Kerry we have someone who claims to be for the little guy, someone who's concerned about the tax burden on americans and yet, is on record as voting for the largest tax increase ever, and the death tax, and for a 50-percent increase in the gas tax.  Family values issues? Oh, yeah, there's a lot here, too.  We're talking about someone who voted against a ban on partial-birth abortion at least three times.. who was one of 14 Senators who voted against the Defense of Marriage Act... someone who voted against a parental notification requirement where minors' abortions are concerned, who voted against mandatory sentences for drug dealers.     &nbsp;    And just in the last few days,  urlLink The New Republic Online  has a put up real Gem on their site. Someone did their homework over there... and remember, TNR is hardly a right-wing paper.       They point up two letters from John Kerry to the same person, sent a few days apart, back in 1991.    &quot;Thank you for contacting me to express your opposition ... to the early use of military force by the US against Iraq. I share your concerns. On January 11, I voted in favor of a resolution that would have insisted that economic sanctions be given more time to work and against a resolution giving the president the immediate authority to go to war.'        --letter from Senator John Kerry to Wallace Carter of Newton Centre, Massachusetts, dated January 22 [1991]   'Thank you very much for contacting me to express your support for the actions of President Bush in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. From the outset of the invasion, I have strongly and unequivocally supported President Bush's response to the crisis and the policy goals he has established with our military deployment in the Persian  gulf.'   --Senator Kerry to Wallace Carter, January 31 [1991] &quot;  Did I say both these letters were sent to the   same person?         Wouldn't want you to forget. I'll bet HE  could.       This is what the 'Little Guy&quot; Democrats are placing all their hopes in? Oh, yeah,   that's   gonna sell in middle America.

          Kerry Attacks President On Threat Posed By Iraq, Does He Not Believe His Own Words?     ___________________________________________________________________      SINCE 1990, KERRY HAS TOLD AMERICA OF SADDAM’S WMD THREAT     &nbsp;      Editor's note:          This constitutes part 3 in what has developed into a series on John Kerry. The man constitutes a bigger threat than Bill Clinton.     If this man gets ahold of America, turn out the lights, America is over.It's that dire a situation. I cannot over-state this point.          Normally, I'd not take a whole collection of quotes someone else already has posted. However, I think this message needs to go out by every avenue possible. And in this case, I doubt they'll mind. This is data from an RNC research briefing.         June 2003          Kerry Said “It Would Be Irresponsible … To Draw Conclusions” That Suggest President Misled On WMD.&nbsp;    ABC’S GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS:&nbsp; “I know you said you’re agnostic about whether or not he misled the public on weapons of mass destruction. But do you have a hunch on whether you think they hyped the intelligence?”&nbsp; KERRY:&nbsp;&nbsp; “George, again, I think it would be irresponsible of me at this point to draw conclusions prior to all the evidence being on the table.”  &nbsp; (ABC’s “This Week,” 6/15/03)&nbsp;        March 2003         As War Began, Kerry Said Saddam Chose “To Make Military Force The Ultimate Weapons Inspections Enforcement Mechanism.”&nbsp;    &nbsp;“Senator John F. Kerry …&nbsp; had lambasted Bush’s diplomatic efforts, despite voting last fall in support of a congressional resolution authorizing military action to disarm Iraq of any weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp; ‘ It appears that with the deadline for exile come and gone, Saddam Hussein has chosen to make military force the ultimate weapons inspections enforcement mechanism ,’ Kerry said.” &nbsp;  (Glen Johnson, “Critics Of Bush Voice Support For The Troops,”  The Boston Globe , 3/20/03)         Kerry Said Saddam Hussein’s WMD “Are A Threat.”&nbsp;    “I think Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction are a threat, and  that’s why I voted to hold him accountable  and to make certain that we disarm him. I think we need to …”&nbsp;   (NPR’s “All Things Considered,” 3/19/03)        February 2003         Kerry Said Leaving Saddam Hussein “Unfettered With Nuclear Weapons Or Weapons Of Mass Destruction Is Unacceptable.”   &nbsp;   (Jill Lawrence, “War Issue Challenges Democratic Candidates,”  USA Today , 2/12/03)         Kerry Described Secretary Of State Colin Powell’s Evidence Of WMD In Iraq As “Real And Compelling.”   &nbsp; “[Kerry] said the Bush administration has taken too long to make its case for military action, ‘but nonetheless I am glad we’ve reached this moment in our diplomacy.’&nbsp; Kerry added: ‘ Convincing evidence of Saddam Hussein’s possession of weapons of mass destruction should trigger, I believe, a final ultimatum from the United Nations for a full, complete, immediate disarmament of those weapons by Iraq . Over the next hours, I will work with my colleagues in the Senate to fully examine the evidence offered by the secretary for a complete and close reading. But, on its face,  the evidence against Saddam Hussein appears real and compelling .’”&nbsp;   (Wayne Washington, “Kennedy, Others Question Timing Of Attack But Presidential Hopefuls Back War With Iraq,”  The Boston Globe , 2/6/03  )        January 2003          Kerry Said, “If You Don’t Believe Saddam Hussein Is A Threat With Nuclear Weapons, Then You Shouldn’t Vote For Me.”   &nbsp;   (Ronald Brownstein, “On Iraq, Kerry Appears Either Torn Or Shrewd,”  Los Angeles Times , 1/31/03)        Kerry Described Threat Of Saddam Hussein With WMD As Real, But Not New.   &nbsp; “[ W]e need to disarm Saddam Hussein. He is a brutal, murderous dictator, leading an oppressive regime . We all know the litany of his offenses. He presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation. He miscalculated an eight-year war with Iran. He miscalculated the invasion of Kuwait. He miscalculated America’s response to that act of naked aggression. He miscalculated the result of setting oil rigs on fire. He miscalculated the impact of sending scuds into Israel and trying to assassinate an American President. He miscalculated his own military strength. He miscalculated the Arab world’s response to his misconduct. And now  he is miscalculating America’s response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction. That is why the world, through the United Nations Security Council, has spoken with one voice, demanding that Iraq disclose its weapons programs and disarm .”&nbsp;   (Sen. John Kerry, Remarks At Georgetown University, Washington, DC, 1/23/03)        October 2002          “Mr. Kerry … Said  Iraq’s Weapons Of Mass Destruction Posed ‘A Real And Grave Threat ’ To The United States.”   &nbsp;   (Dave Boyer, “Key Senators Of Both Parties Back Bush On Iraq War,”  The Washington Times , 10/10/02)        Kerry Questioned Saddam’s Actions With Respect To His WMD Capability.   &nbsp; “Why is Saddam Hussein pursuing weapons that most nations have agreed to limit or give up? Why is Saddam Hussein guilty of breaking his own cease-fire agreement with the international community? Why is Saddam Hussein attempting to develop nuclear weapons when most nations don’t even try, and responsible nations that have them attempt to limit their potential for disaster? Why did Saddam Hussein threaten and provoke? Why does he develop missiles that exceed allowable limits? Why did Saddam Hussein lie and deceive the inspection teams previously? Why did Saddam Hussein not account for all of the weapons of mass destruction which UNSCOM identified? Why is he seeking to develop unmanned airborne vehicles for delivery of biological agents? Does he do all of these things because he wants to live by international standards of behavior? Because he respects international law? Because he is a nice guy underneath it all and the world should trust him?”&nbsp;   (Sen. John Kerry,  Congressional Record , 10/9/02, p. S10171)        Kerry Called It “Naive To The Point Of Grave Danger” To Leave Saddam “To His Own Devices.”&nbsp;    “It would be naive to the point of grave danger not to believe that, left to his own devices, Saddam Hussein will provoke, misjudge, or stumble into a future, more dangerous confrontation with the civilized world.”&nbsp;   (Sen. John Kerry,  Congressional Record , 10/9/02, p. S10171)         Kerry Said “Threat Of Saddam Hussein With Weapons Of Mass Destruction Is Real.”   &nbsp; “The threat of Saddam Hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real, but as I said, it is not new. It has been with us since the end of that war, and particularly in the last 4 years we know after Operation Desert Fox failed to force him to reaccept them, that he has continued to build those weapons.  He has had a free hand for 4 years to reconstitute these weapons, allowing the world, during the interval, to lose the focus we had on weapons of mass destruction and the issue of proliferation .”&nbsp;   (Sen. John Kerry,  Congressional Record , 10/9/02, p. S10171)        Kerry: “I Am Prepared To Hold Saddam Hussein Accountable And Destroy His Weapons Of Mass Destruction.”&nbsp;    (Ronald Brownstein, “Democratic Presidential Hopefuls Differ On War In Iraq,”  Los Angeles Times , 10/6/02)        September 2000          Kerry Said “There Is Nothing More Destabilizing Or Threatening [To The World] Than Weapons Of Mass Destruction.”    “I think all of us are deeply concerned about the degree to which certain countries seem to be contributing to the potential of instability in the world. Obviously, there is nothing more destabilizing or threatening than weapons of mass destruction. We have spent an enormous amount of time and energy focused on Iraq, on Iran, on Russia, on loose nukes, on nuclear materials, and of course on China and on the issue of the transfer of technology to Pakistan.”   (Sen. John Kerry,  Congressional Record , 9/11/00, p. S8321)        December 1998         Kerry Defended Clinton’s 1998 Attacks Because Saddam “Is Pursuing … Weapons Of Mass Destruction.”    “Americans need to really understand the gravity and legitimacy of what is happening with Saddam Hussein.  He has been given every opportunity in the world to comply. The president does not control the schedule  of UNSCOM. The president did not withdraw the UNSCOM inspectors. And the president did not, obviously, cut a deal with Saddam Hussein to do this at this moment. Saddam Hussein has not complied. Saddam Hussein is pursuing a program to build weapons of mass destruction.”  (Sen. John Kerry, Press Conference, 12/16/98)        September 1998          Kerry Said, “‘We’re Going To Have To Make Some Fundamental Decisions About Whether To Follow A Policy Of Containment Or Deprive Iraq Of Its Weapons Of Mass Destruction.”&nbsp;    (Eric Schmitt, “U.N. Arms Inspector Who Quit Is Told He Can’t Make Policy,”  The New York Times , 9/4/98)        February 1998         Kerry Said Saddam Had Already Used WMD And Had Intent “To Do So” Again.   &nbsp; “[T]here are set of principles here that are very large, larger in some measure than I think has been adequately conveyed, both internationally and certainly to the American people.  Saddam Hussein has already used these weapons and has made it clear that he has the intent to continue to try, by virtue of his duplicity and secrecy, to continue to do so .&nbsp; That is a threat to the stability of the Middle East.&nbsp; It is a threat with respect to the potential of terrorist activities on a global basis.&nbsp; It is a threat even to regions near but not exactly in the Middle East.”&nbsp;   (Sen. John Kerry, Press Conference, 2/23/98)         Kerry Said That If Saddam’s Weapon Capability Was Not Eliminated “We Will Be Called On To Send Our Ships And Our Troops At One Point In The Future Back To The Middle East.”    &nbsp;“Saddam Hussein has violated … that standard [against using weapons of mass destruction] on several occasions previously and by most people's expectation, no matter what agreement we come up with, may well do so again. The greater likelihood is that we will be called on to send our ships and our troops at one point in the future back to the Middle East to stand up to the next crisis.”  &nbsp;   (Sen. John Kerry, Press Conference, 2/23/98)        December 1997         Kerry Urged U.N. To Eliminate Iraq’s “Suspected Infrastructure For Developing And Manufacturing Weapons Of Mass Destruction.”   &nbsp; “Democratic Senator John Kerry has said: ‘The Security Council should authorize a strong UN military response that will materially damage, if not totally destroy, as much as possible of the suspected infrastructure for developing and manufacturing weapons of mass destruction.’ He added that ‘Saddam Hussein has intentionally or inadvertently set up a test which the entire world will be watching, and if he gets away with this arrogant ploy, he will have terminated the most important multilateral effort to defuse a legitimate threat to global security.’”&nbsp;   (“US Lawmakers Threaten Military Action Against Iraq,”  Agence France Presse , 12/12/97)        November 1997          Kerry Warned U.S. Senate Of Saddam’s WMD Capabilities.    “It is not possible to overstate  the ominous implications for the Middle East if Saddam were to develop and successfully militarize and deploy potent biological weapons . We can all imagine the consequences. Extremely small quantities of several known biological weapons have the capability to exterminate the entire population of cities the size of Tel Aviv or Jerusalem. These could be delivered by ballistic missile, but they also could be delivered by much more pedestrian means; aerosol applicators on commercial trucks easily could suffice.  If Saddam were to develop and then deploy usable atomic weapons, the same holds true .”   (Sen. John Kerry,  Congressional Record , 11/9/97, pp. S12254 -S12255)        January 1991         Kerry Acknowledged Saddam Working Toward Development Of WMD “For Years.”   &nbsp; “If we go to war in the next few days, it will not be because our immediate vital interests are so threatened and we have no other choice. It is not because of nuclear, chemical, biological weapons when, after all, Saddam Hussein had all those abilities or was working toward them for years ....”  &nbsp; (Sen. John Kerry,  Congressional Record , 1/12/91, p. S369)           October 1990         Kerry Said “Iraq Has Developed A Chemical Weapons Capability.”   &nbsp; “Today, we are confronted by a regional power, Iraq, which has attacked a weaker state, Kuwait. ...&nbsp; The crisis is even more threatening by virtue of the fact that Iraq has developed a chemical weapons capability, and is pursuing a nuclear weapons development program. And Saddam Hussein has demonstrated a willingness to use such weapons of mass destruction in the past, whether in his war against Iran or against his own Kurdish population.”  &nbsp; (Sen. John Kerry,  Congressional Record , 10/2/90, p. S14330)    &nbsp;

      Here's some John Kerry Pictures I think will stick with you.  John Kerry is going to spend the next 250 some-odd days and something around 200 million dollars of ads and so on, to try to get you to forget these images. I've used others in the last few weeks, of course but these have been in my in basket, some sent by readers. (By all means, if you have one to add, send it along!)  When Kerry tries to separate himself from the anti-American movement headed and funded by Hanoi Jane Fonda, remember this one.    When Kerry claims he will speak for American interests as President, remember this one. That's Ho Chi Minn's bust, up there.    When you see a Kerry Bumper Sticker, think:    When Hanoi Jane tries, as she did recently, to tell us about how pro-American she was and how the people like Kerry, following her were heroes, remember what she and her followers, including John Kerry really stood for, as shown us by this pic of her with the VietCong.          When John Kerry tries to tell us about how he's every man, and knows what it's like to work for a living... when he tries to tell us about how he's going to fight for the every man, when he tries to tell us about how he's not the very type he claims to be fighting.. IE; the privileged rich... remember this pic of Kerry on JFK's yacht. That's him on the left. He'd be what, around 15?    When Kerry tells us about how he resepcts the military, and America itself, remember how he got arrested in the act of protesting... not against the war, but against America.     Finally, let's remember that were Kerry in a position to make the choice, the person responsible for so many mass graves in and around Iraq would still be in power. This too, then, is a John Kerry picture.   A picture, they say, is worth 1000 words. Apparently, they were right. I'm banking you're going to remember the real John Kerry, and not what his handlers are spending all that money trying to project.

       0222041417 Rochester,NY--  Let's start with a premise:  War heroes do not fight for their country, and then return to spend the next 30 years or so attacking both the country's actions and call it's fighting men 'war criminals', while working tirelessly to hamstring that country's actions and giving support to that country's sworn enemies.  I will go one step farther. I will not only openly question Kerry's commitment to the defense of our nation, I will openly question Kerry's commitment to our nation, period. Mind, I do not dispute that he was in Vietnam and got himself decorated during that time.   John Kerry apparently assumes that service to one's country while in Uniform entitles one to a lifetime of passes for all their future actions.  But as has been pointed out by others:         War Heroes do not return home from a war and attack their own country!      War Heroes do not return home and attack their fellow veterans and service members!      War Heroes do not throw their medals over a fence at the capital and then later admit they were not theirs to begin with! (hypocrisy??)      War Heroes do not give aid and comfort to the enemy and conduct events under the flag of the enemy!      War Heroes do not lie and paint "ALL" of their fellow veterans as war criminals, before a U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee as he did on April 22, 1971.      War Heroes do not allow themselves and their conduct to be used as a propaganda tool by and for the enemy we are at war with.      War Heroes understand if you don't like a policy, deal with the policy makers not falsely blame and accuse fellow veterans or those serving their country and simply following legal and lawful orders.      War Heroes do not create a situation when they return home that causes more death and severe torture of his fellow veterans still in combat or POW camps!      War Heroes don't have friends and financial sponsors such as Jane Fonda who caused the additional torture of American POW's.      War Heroes do not engage anti war activists to pretend they are veterans to give credence to their cause!      War Heroes do not make the lives of their returning comrades so miserable they are only called shameful names and ostracized from society in general causing many to commit suicide, and have a huge negative impact on their ability to move forward with their lives.      War Heroes do not work hard to create a society where other decorated heroes are afraid to admit they served this country let alone admit they are heroes themselves. Unless of course they are a part of his anti America band wagon.      War Heroes do not attack the military of their own country.      War Heroes do not create or promote an environment that makes members of the military feel ashamed of their service to their country.  Kerry complained via a letter to President Bush:        "As you well know, Vietnam was a very difficult and painful period in our nation's history, and the struggle for our veterans continues. So, it has been hard to believe that you would choose to reopen these wounds for your personal political gain. But, that is what you have chosen to do."    Fact is, though, that Bush is not the one who decided to open those wounds, but Kerry. Let's call this what it is; Kerry's the one who made his middle name 'Served in Vietnam' So, Kerry, really, are the one that started that one. What everyone to his right, and many to his left have  done is to simply point out his voting record since that time.  Well, wait. Since Kerry brought it up, let's examine his service for just a moment, shall we?  Kerry spent a total of four months in country. Four months.  During that time, he suffered three flesh wounds, two of them minor. When he got purple hearts for said injuries, they were given based on recommendations Kerry himself wrote.  Once he got his third Purple heart, he asked to be sent back. stateside. Even Adml Elmo Zumwalt stated flatly that he'd have problems in his political carrier based on his experiences in 'nam.  Once he came back form 'nam, he then proceeded to sit down before Congress and outright lie about a number of atrocities, committed he said, by American servicemen there. Yet, he never witnessed them. In short Mr. Kerry LIED, and slandered his fellow servicemen.  The real issue is what he did since getting into office. This, it seems was very consistent with his anti-Americanism since coming back form 'nam... Kerry is on record as having voted against every single Pentagon weapons program during his tenure in the U.S. Senate. Every single one.  This kind of wekaness at best, and in truth, anti-Americanism, is something I want nowhere near the reins of power.  Apparently a lot of other people who served in Vietnam, don't want him there, either.  Vietnam Veterans Against John Kerry (V.V.A.J.K) has formed a national coalition with Vietnamese Americans for Human Rights in Vietnam.    "We represent hundreds of thousand of American veterans who do not want to see John Kerry any where near the Oval Office," said Ted Sampley, founder of V.V.A.J.K, and a U.S. Army Green Beret and veteran of two combat tours in Vietnam.   I have personally dealt with John Kerry on the issue of US POWs left behind in Vietnam. Kerry is not truthful and is not worthy of the support of US veterans. Many Vietnam vets have been duped into thinking Kerry is their friend. He is not. To us, he is 'Hanoi John'"    Dan Tran, a NASA engineer and president of the Vietnam Human Rights Project, said, "John Kerry aided and abetted the communist government in Hanoi and has hindered any human rights progress in Vietnam."  Mike Benge, former civilian Viet Nam POW says, "John Kerry has fought harder for the Vietnamese communists than he fought against them in Vietnam.    "In the Senate, Kerry almost single handedly prevented a Vietnam Human Rights (and religious freedom) Bill from coming to a vote. Mean while the Vietnamese communists continue to wage a war of repression against our former South Vietnamese allies and a war of genocide against the Montagnard ethnic minorities in the Central Highlands of Vietnam."    Chau Nguyen, President of the Vietnamese Community in NY said, Pastors, Priests, and Buddhist Monks are being held against their will and many are beaten close to death on a regular basis"  When Kerry returned from military service in Vietnam he became a national leader and spokesperson of Vietnam Veterans Against the War.  In this role, Hanoi John campaigned against the efforts of the United States to contain the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia. Under Kerry's leadership, VVAW members marched in demonstrations under the flags of the Viet Cong enemy and displayed pictures of Ho Chi Minh. They mocked the uniform of United States soldiers by wearing tattered fatigues, many marked with pro-communist graffiti.  In congressional testimony Hanoi John called the U.S. involvement in Vietnam "a genocide against the Vietnamese people" and referred to his former comrades as "war criminals." The false image and social stigma portraying Vietnam vets as "drug-addicted baby killers and mindless drones" can be traced directly to John Kerry and his VVAW.  "It's one thing," said New York Vietnam veteran Jerry Kiley, "to oppose a war for moral reasons, but it's dishonorable to take that extra step and support the enemy. That's what John Kerry did."  Dan Tran, speaking as a member of Vietnamese Americans Against John Kerry said, "On behalf of tens of thousands of Vietnamese-Americans, we are determined to demonstrate against Senator Kerry all across this nation"  The Coalition plans nationwide demonstrations against Kerry beginning with the New York primary.  Finally, let's remember that a war hero doesn't take illegal campaign contributions from the Chinese. According to the LA TIMES...    "Sen. John F. Kerry sent 28 letters in behalf of a San Diego defense contractor who pleaded guilty last week to illegally funneling campaign contributions to the Massachusetts senator and four other congressmen.  Members of Congress often write letters supporting constituent businesses and favored projects. But as the Democratic presidential front-runner, Kerry has promoted himself as a candidate who has never been beholden to campaign contributors and special interests. . . .  Asked what he did to repay the money, Kerry's campaign said Wednesday he had donated $13,000 to charity on Feb. 9 which was two days before Majumder's guilty plea."     Anyone still think Bush isn't going to be able to defeat Kerry?

      022904141657- Buffalo, NY--  This afternoon, I'm in Buffalo with the family, doing a little railfanning. This spot, out along Broadway, is one of the big spots for rail traffic.  It's also the area of town that the Buffalo area band, The GooGooDolls sing about in "Broadway's Dark Tonight". Not exactly a high-rent district anymore, though this spot we're in is safe enough.   urlLink Here's a site with a lot of photos from the area.   The shots are mostly mid-90's vintage, pre CSX stuff when Conrail still ran the show. Most of what you can see is still there today.  As we wait for events to unfold, I'm struck again, by a comparison I saw drawn a couple days ago in one of the many online discussion groups I'm involved with. The idiot actually tried to compare John Kerry to Alfred Nobel. Apparently, this guy thought them both motivated by similar interests... peace, and they both had life changing events that led them in that direction. Too bad the person making that comparison is such a poor student of history.  When Alfred Nobel's brother, Ludwig, died in 1888 while doing oil exploration in Russia, a French newspaper of the day inadvertently published an obituary about not Ludwig, but Alfred, who in his turn was most famous at the time for having invented dynamite. The translated headline read, "The merchant of death is dead." One imagines what goes through the mind of Nobel as he read his own obituary. Ironically, Ludwig was blown up incidental to mis-handling his brother's invention.  There's not much in the way of supporting evidence to this, but it's suggested repeatedly among academics that this was a major turning point in Nobel's life, and forced him into the active pursuit of peace, and to found the peace prize that now bears his name.  urlLink Kenne Fant for example, in the book "Alfred Nobel: A Biography" (ISBN# : 1559702222, Arcade Publishing, NY 1993)  notes that Nobel become so concerned about his legacy that he set about working to establish that legacy in a more peacful mode, establishing among other things, the fund that established the Nobel Peace Prize.  There are many among us who would suggest that Presidential hopeful John Kerry is not unlike Nobel, in having come to a juncture as regards military conflict and it's results, and worked ever after toward peace.  Of course this is the best of all possible spins, but how true is it? There are extensive records on both people and they tend to paint some rather different pictures which do not favor Kerry. as Kerry's supporters would have hoped.  First, unlike John Kerry, who was born into wealth and married into more of it, Nobel was born into poverty, in 1833, and worked his way out of it.... having amassed so many patents for inventions that only Thomas Edison had more.  Kerry's never had a job, never worked a day in his life, never has understood nor will he, how the working man survives. Nobel knew.   Nobel also never turned his back on country and on his comrades in arms as John Kerry did.... Never embraced the opposition as Kerry has done.  I don't doubt we'll see the comparison come up during the campaign, particularly as Kerry gets more desperate. Think I'm off base, here? Think again; how much on the Democrat side got invested in Jimmy Carter got the Nobel prize some years ago... ironic, given he did  more to bring about war with his capitulation than any President in history with the possible exception of FDR.  Josh Chafetz says very well over at Oxblog what I've been thinking for some days, now regards John Kerry:  "He's trying to claim that, because he's a veteran, any discussion of his views on national security is off-limits, even discussions about the way he has voted during his years in the Senate:  In a letter to Bush, Kerry wrote: "As you well know, Vietnam was a very difficult and painful period in our nation's history, and the struggle for our veterans continues. So, it has been hard to believe that you would choose to reopen these wounds for your personal political gain. But, that is what you have chosen to do."  Kerry was reacting to criticism earlier in the day from a leading Georgia Republican who, speaking for Bush's re-election campaign, predicted trouble for Kerry in the state's primary.  Sen. Saxby Chambliss said during a conference call arranged by the Bush campaign that Kerry has a "32-year history of voting to cut defense programs and cut defense systems."  When Kerry responded later, at his side was Max Cleland, a triple-amputee Vietnam veteran who lost his Senate seat to Chambliss in 2002 after being portrayed as soft on homeland security.  He said the president "decided once again to take the low road of American politics."  Look, no one is attacking Kerry's record in Vietnam. He served honorably, and he, like every veteran, deserves thanks and praise from every American for what he did there. But that doesn't insulate him from criticism based on what he's done since -- his anti-war activities when he returned are fair game; his votes in the Senate are fair game; his statements on Iraq are fair game. Note that Chambliss' comment talked about a 32-year history -- 32 years ago was 1972 -- after Kerry got back from Vietnam. Again, no one here is questioning his Vietnam service -- they're questioning his political activity since he returned. And it's Kerry's attempts to foreclose these policy discussions that are taking "the low road of American politics."  However, I'll take it one step farther than Josh does, here. I WILL attack Kerry's Vietnam record,as many vets have... openly and loudly. After all, Kerry's the one who changed his middle name to 'Served in Vietnam', so his service, such as it is, is fair game as a target.  Kerry spent a total of four months in country. Four months.  During that time, he suffered three flesh wounds, two of them minor. When he got purple hearts for said injuries, they were given based on recommendations Kerry himself wrote. How many of US can be so fortunate as to write our own ticket?  Once he got his third Purple heart, he asked to be sent back stateside. This, he got, too. Again, the man writes his own ticket and dares call it 'sacrifice'. His field commanders had serious questions about his service to this country. Even Adml Elmo Zumwalt stated flatly that he'd have problems in his political carrier based on his experiences in 'nam.  Once he came back form 'nam, he then proceeded to sit down before Congress and outright lie about a number of atrocities, committed he said, by American servicemen there. Yet, he never witnessed them In short Mr Kerry LIED, and slandered his fellow servicemen.  But, as Josh suggests above... The real issue is what he did since getting into office. This, it seems was very consistent with his anti- Americanism since coming back from 'nam... Kerry is on record as having voted against every single Pentagon weapons program during his tenure in the U.S. Senate. Every single one.  And as for it all being with the intent of creating peace, tell me; why is it he never ONCE protested the actions in war that the Communists made? Or is it that he thinks it's only non-communist nations that foster war?  Further, look at the statements made by John Kerry's people this morning as regards the Rebels in Haiti; he'd have sided with the Communist backed Rebels.  All in the name of 'peace' of course.  This kind of selective weakness at best, and in truth, anti-Americanism, is something I want nowhere near the reins of power.  There's a name for his kind of actions... but that name certainly isn't "Nobility", as some would have you think.  And it's certainly is not "Presidential", either.

      0307041748-Byron, NY--  Well, as I predicted, more lies from Kerry are being exposed. Here's a few from the many that have come up this week, that I put into my Palm Pilot:  Kerry's been carefully crafting this image of someone who rushed out to serve in Vietnam. But the real story seems to be coming out at last. The press has picked up on an old Harvard Crimson article that contained information about how Kerry...      "...tried to defer his military service for a year, according to a newly rediscovered article in a Harvard University newspaper.      He wrote to his local recruitment board seeking permission to spend a further 12 months studying in Paris, after completing his degree course at Yale University in the mid-1960s."  Which of course means that his whole 'I served this country willingly' shtick is brought into serious question. For months now, the left has charged Mr. Bush with lying to the American people. Now, we find out what they charge The President with, Kerry has done.  Further, it seems that Kerry was negotiating with the enemy in 1971. He told Congress during  urlLink his testimony:      ....I have been to Paris. I have talked with both delegations at the peace talks, that is to say the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Provisional Revolutionary Government..."           Other news:  Kerry, it seems has missed on the order of 64% of the Senate roll Call votes. Says the Boston Herald:      "The Herald reported yesterday that Kerry, the Democratic front-runner, has missed every one of the 22 roll call votes in the Senate this year and 292, or 64 percent, last year."  Now, Kerry and his supporters, like to tell us about how using an attack on our shores is inappropriate. But let's look back into history, with some help from Jen, over at The Greatest Jeneration:  Says Jen:      "This is a photo of an actual lapel button for Roosevelt's 1944 re-election campaign.         IN YOUR FACE to all those whining Leftist Libs who think it's "offensive" and "inappropriate" for President Bush to include images from the 9/11 attacks in his re-election ads!"  So, not only is Bush not the first, but it seems that the bighest example of such is the liberal icon himself, FDR.  A picture, it seems, is worth 1000 words, after all.    Elsewhere, we've all seen the ad:       "Announcer: Times are tough. So you work overtime to make ends meet. Then you find out George Bush wants to eliminate overtime pay for 8 million workers. Two million jobs lost. Jobs going overseas. And now, no overtime pay. When it comes to choosing between corporate values and family values, face it, George Bush is not on our side."         Trouble is, as usual the Democrats are basing their arguments on a flat-out lie.  Says FactCheck.org :   "The 8-million figure (hotly denied by the Bush administration, of course) comes from a study by the labor-funded Economic Policy Institute.  The ad misquotes the study, however. What the study actually says is that an estimated 8 million would lose the legal right to premium overtime rates should they work more than 40 hours per week. It does not say they would actually lose pay as the ad says. In fact, the 8-million figure is inflated by many part-time workers who never get overtime work, or overtime pay, even though they now have the right to it."  Apparently with all of the problems surrounding Kerry, the people most likely to get Kerry's call as his running mate aren't too happy about their chances of winning. ABC's story goes into detail.      "Three top Democrats, all talked about as possible running mates for presumptive presidential nominee John Kerry, on Sunday suggested a lack of interest in being vice president but none ruled it out."  From North Korea comes news that:      "North Korea's state-controlled media are well known for reverential reporting about Kim Jong-il, the country's dictatorial leader. But the Dear Leader is not the only one getting deferential treatment from the communist state's propaganda machine: John Kerry, the presumptive Democratic candidate, is also getting good play in Pyongyang."  You can't make up stuff like this. I can't imagine this won't be something the Kerry campaign won't try to downplay... If the Republicans are smart, (And they are) they won't let that one pass unmarked.  Finally, a note from the Boston Herald, who reported a direct quote from the flip-flopable Mr. Kerry:  "The first definition of patriotism is keeping faith with those who have worn the uniform of the country,' said Kerry, who argued in the Democrats' weekly radio address that Bush has not given the troops sufficient logistical support."  You oughta know, Idiot... You're the one who voted against what they now don't have.  And does 'keeping faith' include calling those who have worn the uniform 'baby killers, as you did'?     And the Kerry saga continues....

      0314042007- Rochester, NY--  The Kerry saga of lies continues.   I've collected a few items form the past week:  * The Seattle Times reports:  "WASHINGTON - The Interior Department's inspector general has found no basis for a claim by Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry that White House political advisers interfered in developing water policy in the Northwest"  In other words: Kerry Lied. Again.  * If you’ll recall, I expressed some level of question as regards the speed with which the “outrage’ hit the airwaves about the ads the president’s been running.  For a few days I was alone in my questioning of it. But now, (thank God..) people are starting on learning the truth  To listen to media whining for the last couple weeks, you ‘d think that all this was because a group of people associated with September 11th victims were so mad they got together to protest Mr. Bush, and that all that outrage was spontaneous.  Nope.  We’re now finding out that’s not true... and all it took was about 15 minutes with Google. Lookie what Bithead found!  Seems that a group calling itself "September Eleventh Families for Peaceful Tomorrows" being funded by George Soros among others had this reaction all planned out, knowing full well the subject would come up.  This is not outrage... this is cynical Democrat party politics as usual, and Mr. Bush should be calling Kerry out on this one.  Oh, but hold da phone… you’ve seen NOTHING yet. This gets even better! In my searching, I find that "Peaceful Tomorrows" is listed as an official project of the Tides Center and its parent group, the Tides Foundation which is a radical leftist group I’ve mentioned before as one funded by Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of Democrat candidate John Kerry. The Kerrys have poured over $4 million to the Tides Foundation between 1995-2001. Two other Heinz family foundations have poured in an additional $2 million.  They claim of course, on their site that :  "September 11th Families for Peaceful Tomorrows has never received funding from Teresa Heinz Kerry, John Kerry, the Howard Heinz Endowment, or the Vira I. Heinz Endowment. We have no connection with the Heinz or Kerry families through Tides Foundation, the Tides Center or any other entity."  Ah, but wait... and re read that response with some care, and you may notice that this carefully crafted rebuttal doesn't address, much less answer the question of them getting money from TIDES, which in turn was funded by Kerry and company.  Clinton himself couldn't wiggle better. The impression they're trying to leave, that they got no funding whatever from Kerry...simply does not wash with the tax records. They did, in fact, get money form Tides and the other Kerry orgs, and they're trying to cover Kerry's butt with a bit of slight of hand.  "Tides", and " Peaceful Tomorrows" should be examined by the IRS, and by the FEC for federal level violations, and the Kerrys belong in jail over this one. This kind of cynical ploy at the expense of the victims of 9/11 cannot go unchallenged.  * Then of course, there's the under-the-breath comments from Kerry.  The fact is that this is decidedly not news. The reason it's not news is it was not unexpected.  As vile as his comments are, everyone already knew he feels that way, and has been talking that way behind the scenes for four years. These comments were bound to come out eventually. At east now, his vile sludge is out in the open, and can be dealt with by the voters.  I suspect it will be. Even the Democrats are running for the exists for the most part.  And is it just me, or did it strike you that some of Dean rubbed off on him? I mean they meet and he gets taped mouthing this crap... not unlike Dean.  * Everything I Know Is Wrong quotes The Captain who makes a valid point about Kerry's claim of encouragement from (unspecified) foreign leaders. assuming he's not lying, that is....:  " If Kerry really is in clandestine communication with foreign leaders and discussing changes in American foreign policy under his proposed administration, then he is interfering with the foreign policy of the current administration, which may be an actionable offense, depending on the circumstances."  This kind of thing is why he's in my hot blogroll...  I'd add to this, if he IS talking to them, are they backing these wishes with MONEY... such as the Chinese...  Even today, he's getting called on it; Colin Powell on Fox News Sunday today quietly suggested Kerry 'fess up on wh it is he's been talking to. Of course, he won't.     * Some interesting reports from London's TELEGRAPH, with an interview of Stepehn Gardner, who is openly questioning Kerry's 'Vietnam hero' status. Gardner, you see was THERE, and saw Kerry's actions for himself. Says the TELGRAPH"      "The testimony of Steven Gardner, a gunner's mate on the first patrol boat commanded by Mr Kerry in the Mekong delta, contradicts accounts of the senator's military career that depict him as a brave and aggressive lieutenant who won three Purple Hearts and which are a key element of his campaign against George Bush.      "He absolutely did not want to engage the enemy when I was with him," Mr Gardner said in an interview with the Boston Globe, which contacted him about the presidential candidate. "He wouldn't go in there and search. That is why I have a negative viewpoint of John Kerry.      "His initial patterns of behaviour when I met him and served under him were of somebody who ran from the enemy, rather than engaged it."     And finally, comes word from the RNC that Steve Schmidt, A Bush campaign spokesman, suggests:      "After calling Republicans crooks and liars, running 17 negative ads over 15,000 times and spending $6.3 million attacking the president, John Kerry is calling for a civil debate on the issues... John Kerry should finish the debate with himself."   Can't say it better, myself.

      Rochester,NY--  It's been about a year now, since President Bush gave the order to invade Iraq, based on UN resolutions. By the info we had then, it was the correct thing to do on many levels. And since then, it has been show all the more to have been the correct action. As time has gone on, it's becoming clear how  Saddam Hussein abused the United Nation’s oil-for-food program.     Just within the last few weeks, The New York Times posted an article on how..,      “Saddam Hussein’s government systematically extracted billions of dollars in kickbacks from companies doing business with Iraq, funneling most of the illicit funds through a network of foreign bank accounts in violation of United Nations sanctions.”     The evidence that's now coming to light from The Iraqi Governing Council pretty much confirms, and in fact goes well beyond the report by the U.S. General Accounting Office, which told us that Saddam and his thugs had used the Oil for food program to steal several billion dollars between 1997 the present... money that could have made the Iraqi people rich many times over, particularly in contrast to the condition we found them in one year ago.     Of greater import, however, is the picture that we're exposing behind the more obvious fraud committed by Saddam and Company.  Now that they're out from under the thumb of Saddam, Iraq's Oil Ministry has been telling us by way f the meticulous documentation kept for Saddam, a list of names of companies  and individuals world-wide,  that also benefited financially by means of Iraqi oil, under Saddam's rule. They did so by getting oil... lots of it; at far below market prices.     On this is are French and German names, such as Charles Pasqua, the former French Foreign Minister, as well as Russian names, among them being higher-ups with Putin's office. Worse, the names on the list also include many within the UN itself... up to and including Kofi Anan's number 2 man Benon V. Sevan,  who according  to UN records I've found, was in charge of the oil-for-food program. All in all, according to Iraqi newspaper reports, about 270 former Cabinet officials, legislators, political activists and journalists in about 46 countries are involved in the scam.     Tish Durkin recently summed it all up for us, in the National Journal:         "Through regular but vague accounting practices, the members of the Security Council are kept apprised of how much money has been earned through the program, and how much has been allocated to each sector," she wrote.      "But they do not know how much has been spent, or on what. Incredibly, the oil-for-food program has never been audited. Yes: one madman, 10 agencies, 15 independently self-interested Security Council members, more than 50 billion smackers, zero audits,"  As a result of all of this, several questions spring into view, from the American point of view, not only on the world stage but on the domestic side as well given the election cycle in progress just now.  If the reports are true, that the whole thing was crooked... (And given Kofi Anan's call for an independent audit, we have no reason to think they're not)...  * What else can we not trust the UN on, at least as regards Iraq? For that matter what CAN we trust the UN on going forward?  *If by the UN's action and stupidity, some folks with UN authority benefit from the oil for food program continuing, wouldn't they be motivated to arrange for the continuance of the program....  * Say, for example, UN teams not finding WMD in Iraq that did exist so as to continue the oil-for food program so as to maximize their profits from the scam.  * Could they even gone so far as to having  what WMD did exist, moved out to say, Syria, after the gig was up, to cover their butts....  *Is it possible, based on this new informaiton, that our intel on Iraq wasn't so far off after all?  * And let's consider John Kerry's position, in light of all of this.      "I'm an internationalist," Kerry told The Harvard Crimson 10 months after returning home from Vietnam. "I'd like to see our troops dispersed through the world only at the directive of the United Nations." --      http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=37068              "I've met with foreign leaders who can't go out and say this publicly," he said. "But, boy, they look at you and say: 'You've got to win this. You've got to beat this guy. We need a new policy.' Things like that."       http://www.washtimes.com/national/20040312-120719-7926r.htm      "I believed a year ago and I believe now that we had to hold Saddam Hussein accountable and that the United States needed to lead in that effort," he said in explaining his vote. "But this administration did it in the worst possible way--without the United Nations, without our allies, without a legitimate plan to win the peace."      http://www.cfr.org/pub6577/bernard_gwertzman/kerry_calls_for_un_control_of_iraq.php  It's clear Kerry wants to place the United States, and the world under the total control of what has revealed itself as a corrupted body. I think we all know by now what foreign leaders Kerry was talking about; the ones benefiting from  the "Oil for Food" scam. France and Germany and Russia.  Remember, if all this sounds extreme, so is the money. Think about the raw numbers of dollars we're dealing with here... Between 10 and 40 billion so far.  There seems to me many directions this corruption that we are only now finding, could have gone. Indeed, I doubt we'll find it all.  And then there's the laugh-a-minute Hans Blix still trying to sell his story to a press eager to have him justify their leftist politics. Is Blix just part of a cover, to which our own leftist press is an unwitting party?  Our course is clear; The US should shut off all funding to the UN.  Now. All of it...  At least, until such time as the UN can give an accounting of itself in the matter.  And John Kerry should be explaining to us why he wants the United States controlled by a group demonstrably corrupted.     Have you noticed he's not once mentioned the oil-for-food scam?  Shouldn't be too hard for you to figure out why.  Let's end this on a positive note:      "America will never seek a permission slip to defend the security of our country." --President George W. Bush

      040404142742--Rochester NY  Let's open this with an admission; There's not much to write about on the subject I've been writing on for the last several weeks; John Kerry.   So, perhaps this week we should turn to his supporters for things to write on...let's see what we can find that is consistent between them, that's currently making the rounds.  One of the ones that's gained some serious argument in Blogdom of late is Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, otherwise known to we mere mortals, as "Daily Kos" Kos, as he's known, has been rather tight with the Democrat leadership for some time. According to reports, John Kerry's campaign has received $48,349 by 566 donors through Daily Kos. The Democrat Party as a whole has received $60,776 by 636 donors through Daily Kos. Kerry's website linked directly to Kos.   Linked, as in past tense, because this genius came up with the following comment, as regards the news media not showing for the most part, the available vid of the Fallujah attacks...  "Let the people see what war is like... There are real repercussions to Bush's folly. That said, I feel nothing over the death of mercenaries. They aren't in Iraq because of orders, or because they are there trying to help the people make Iraq a better place. They are there to wage war for profit. Screw them.'"  Well, first, I suppose I should ask: Delivering food and such is "waging war for profit"?   That point aside, it is interesting how often the left shows how much of it's mantra is founded in blind hatred... and this seems a potent example of such. Eric Margolis, of Blogs For Bush says it better than most:  "Such shameful, despicable, immoral words, uttered by liberal blogger Markos Moulitsas ("Kos") are a sad and disturbing reflection of the lows that liberals take themselves to because of their hatred for President Bush, and objections to the freedom of the Iraqi people.  It is by no means any less disturbing that Senator John Kerry and the Democrat Party have embraced Kos because of his prowess on the blogosphere."  And Kos is by no means unique in this.   Indeed, he's unremarkable. I mean, at what point do we start to admit to ourselves that Kos and his now-exposed attitudes, are not all that unusual on the left?   Let's take a look at Democrat rank and file for reaction to his 'outing', right from John F'ing Kerry's website, to drive the point home, shall we?     "Cutting off your nose to spite your face in my opinion. Kos has not only raised awareness of Democratic values, he has raised real dollars to aid in the fight against Bush and his cronies. Even if his post was incorrect (which it wasn't, in its entirety), we NEED Kos, period."    So gloating over American dead is Democratic Values? Nice they finally admit it.  ...  "As a Democrat who supports John Kerry for President, I hereby DEMAND that you replace this link and quit acting like cowards."  So, not agreeing with Kos in his gloat over American dead is being a 'coward'.  ...  "The DailyKos blog has done more to invigorate progressive and Democratic action, activism, and information than just about any destination on the Internet."  ...  "What KoS said makes some sense."  "Chasing the big stories the Media is in a tizzy over is just politics as usual and won't separate this campaign from the sensationalism"  ...  "It's almost frightening to see such censorship from someone who claims to be a Democrat...some big tent!!"  Oh, great. So, calling Kos what he is, is censorship.  ...  "kos is a moderate mainstream Democrat."     Yeah, I'll accept that. But, think, actually stop think and ask yourselves, you who call yourself mainstream Democrats... like what you see?  "Because Kos is a part of the mainstream left and a DNC insider, the average American could get the idea that his comments are a reflection of the Party’s feelings about American and Americans."  Oh, that last one's a keeper. "Could get the idea"?  Could see that as the fact, you mean.  This last guy at least is willing to admit the truth; that the American people will see this is the kind of mindless hatred that the left is driven by. And in the end, that's really all it is, driving tem; Hate.   This hate is nothing new; Hate has always been party and parcel of the left. Kos and his comments are not at all unlike Fonda and her ilk..(Kerry included) wishing death and destruction on those fighting in 'nam. This is not piling on; this is simply fact. Fact the left canntot get around. Try as the left will to disconnect themselves from such people, they cannot; such people, such ideals, are the base of the left wing today.      The sooner we can get to the point of admitting it, we can "move on."  Pun intended.   Keep a watch on BitsBlog; I'm sure this story is far from over.

       South Byron, NY---  I'm doing some railfanning outside South Byron NY, which is a bit west of Rochester. Because of the Easter holiday, rail traffic is light. Just as well; I'm getting a lot of reading done, from various news sources.  Well, the Democrats got what they wanted... they got the President to release the PDB from August 6th 2001, which had the title headlined, "Bin Laden Determined To Strike in US." But what did they get?  I expect they got exactly what they wanted; a smoke screen, to cover their own actions. Here's the exact text of that PDB: (Bold is mine... you'll see why in a minute)    -1-  Osama bin Laden Determined To Strike in US  Clandestine, foreign government, and media reports indicate Osama bin Laden since 1997 has wanted to conduct terrorist attacks in the US. bin Laden implied in US television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would follow the example of World Trade Centre bomber Ramzi Yousef and "bring the fighting to America".  After US missile strikes on his base in Afghanistan in 1998, bin Laden told followers he wanted to retaliate in Washington according to a XXXXXX service.  An Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) operative told an XXXXXX service at the same time that bin Laden was planning to exploit the operative's access to the US to mount a terrorist strike.  The millennium plotting in Canada in 1999 may have been part of bin Laden's first serious attempt to implement a terrorist strike in the US.  Convicted plotter Ahmed Ressam has told the FBI that he conceived the idea to attack Los Angeles International Airport himself, but that Bin Ladin lieutenant Abu Zubaydah encouraged him and helped facilitate the operation. Ressam also said that in 1998 Abu Zubaydah was planning his own US attack.  Ressam says bin Laden was aware of the Los Angeles operation.  Although bin Laden has not succeeded, his attacks against the US Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 demonstrate that he prepares operations years in advance and is not deterred by setbacks.  Bin Laden associates surveilled our Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam as early as 1993, and some members of the Nairobi cell planning the bombings were arrested and deported in 1997.  Al-Qaida members – including some who are US citizens – have resided in or traveled to the US for years, and the group apparently maintains a support structure that could aid attacks. Two al-Qaida members found guilty in the conspiracy to bomb our Embassies in East Africa were US citizens, and a senior EIJ member lived in California in the mid-1900s.  A clandestine source said in 1998 that a bin Laden cell in New York was recruiting Muslim-American youth for attacks.  We have not been able to corroborate some of the more sensational threat reporting, such as that from a XXXXXX service in 1998 saying that bin Laden wanted to hijack a US aircraft to gain the release of "Blind Shaykh" 'Umar 'Abd al-Rahman and other US-held extremists.  Nevertheless, FBI information since that time indicates patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings or other types of attacks, including recent surveillance of federal buildings in New York.  The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the US that it considers bin Laden-related.  CIA and the FBI are investigating a call to our Embassy in the UAE in May saying that a group of Bin Ladin supporters was in the US planning attacks with explosives.  Declassified and Approved for Release, 10 April 2004  -0-      So, clearly, even based on the document the Democrats were clamoring for, the White House had nothing new to go on and certainly no actionable information.  Yes, it's true, the Democrats are quick to wave the the paragraph about "The FBI is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the US that it considers Bin Laden-related."  Trouble with that argument, however, is that even investigations to this day, have revealed no connections between the investigations mentioned in the PDB, and the 9/11 attacks.  Now, we know that DNC 'attack poodle' David BenVineste had seen this memo before it was declassified. Why would he then be pressing for this memo in open hearings? If the goal of the commission, is as stated, to find out how to prevent such attacks from happening again, and this was information the commission already had in hand, why would BenVineste have persisted in his 'attack poodle District Attorney' routine?      Political cover, that's why.  Notice; I didn't say political points, though admittedly, on the surface there's much to commend the concept, and in fact such an argument will give a boost to the Democrats among the uninformed. But what I said was "Political cover." Cover from what? Why, what the Democrats don't want you to know, of course.  Which is, that President George W. Bush's first major national security policy directive was in the words of Condi Rice: "not Russia, not missile defense, not Iraq, but the elimination of al-Qaeda."   The fact is that the directive was issued a week before the attacks, on September 4, 2001. Now, Doctor Rice didn't say as much, but the order took nigh on eight months to process. This was not due to a lack in the Bush administration. This is however directly connection to the Democrats who held up confirmations of key members of the new administration until less than two months before the 9/11 attacks.  Which in turn, explains why so many of the security positions at the highest levels, were still staffed by Clinton Mis-administration appointees.... such as Richard Clarke. As a result of this Democrat stonewalling, for example, Mr. Bush's appointee for the top NSC special assistant for intelligence programs, Mary Sturtevant, had only been on the job for several weeks on 9/11. Do you suppose this would have any effect on how responsive the White House was to various threats?  To their credit, the White House has brought up none of this; Indeed, they need not do so, since as I've said they were already properly reacting to everything they knew about.   Clearly, were  the general public to find out about this connection, they'd lose the desperately needed political points they've spent their entire time on the 9/11 commission trying to gain. Time they were supposed to be using for the purposes of fact finding.  Now ask yourself; will anyone bring what I've just told you into account in the 9/11 commission's final report?  You know better, don't you really?

      It wasn't until I actually got them home, that I realized I'd purchased 'home style' dog biscuits, for my dog. I recognize that this is a sales gimmick, but I must admit being confused.   I know of nobody who makes their own dog treats. Logically, one could ask the question; What, exactly constitutes 'home style' dog biscuits? I asked my dog, but it appears to be as secret as the location of Saddam's WMD, or of Bush's Baked Beans recipe, she's not telling.  Then again, this is a beast that given the option, would drink out of the toilet, so perhaps trusting her judgments on what constitutes home-style food is not the most productive of paths.  Another offhanded example of saying it simply because it sells:   The other day I saw a Chevy... a fairly new Malibu, as it happened, not unlike one I traded in for an SUV just a few months ago. Apparently, they're now calling the model the "Malibu Classic". Now, as I say, I owned a '98, and completely enjoyed that car. It's a fine one and one that should be at the top of the buyer's list, if handling, quickness and durability are at or near the top of your list; I put 80,000 miles on that car, and enjoyed every one of them. But "classic"? I don't think so. On looking at that newer car with the 'classic' sticker on it, I can only shake my head in wonder. I suppose the value of the word 'classic' has changed.      My own thought about what constitutes a 'classic Malibu' runs a lot closer to the pavement scorcher I drove in my outrageously mis-spent youth...   One looking very much like this one, though I should say mine was a pale green 70, not this red '72. About the only comparison between the currently labeled "Malibu Classic" and the earlier version of the car is that they both burn gas, go fast and wear bowties. Past that... (sigh) What do you suppose the chances are of Chevy turning out current versions of the 72 Malibu, eh?  In any event, so much of what goes on in America anymore is what happens to be what someone thinks will sell. Some things that will sell, are just stupid, some are amusing. Some are annoying, and some are downright destructive.   One of the things someone thought would sell, was a reading of the names of the soldiers who have died in Iraq, on ABC's NIGHTLINE, which was 'sold' to us as 'honoring the dead'. A classic case of mislabeling which I consider destructive, though the reasons may not be obvious to you at first glance.  I would ask, in this case, "What constitutes 'honoring the dead"?  Of course just what it is they're selling with this action, seems an issue. Sinclair, assuming the worst motives on the part of Koppel, (and given ABC's well documented history, who can blame them, really?)  Sinclair pre-empted the ABC feed on it's 8 stations. Said Sinclair:    "The ABC Television network announced on Tuesday that the Friday, April 30th edition of “Nightline” will consist entirely of Ted Koppel reading aloud the names of U.S. servicemen and women killed in action in Iraq. Despite the denials by a spokeswoman for the show the action appears to be motivated by a political agenda designed to undermine the efforts of the United States in Iraq.  While the Sinclair Broadcast Group honors the memory of the brave members of the military who have sacrificed their lives in the service of our country, we do not believe such political statements should be disguised as news content. As a result, we have decided to preempt the broadcast of “Nightline” this Friday on each of our stations which air ABC programming.  We understand that our decision in this matter may be questioned by some. Before you judge our decision, however, we would ask that you first question Mr. Koppel as to why he chose to read the names of the 523 troops killed in combat in Iraq, rather than the names of the thousands of private citizens killed in terrorists attacks since and including the events of September 11, 2001. In his answer, you will find the real motivation behind his action scheduled for this Friday."     Koppel, in response asks the question:     "Why, in heaven's name, should one not be able to look at the faces and hear the names and see the ages of those young people who are not coming back alive and feel somehow ennobled by the fact that they were willing to give up their lives for something that is in the national interest of all of us?"     Oh.... how noble. Oh.... how worthy...... Oh, poop.  How utterly TRANSPARENT.   Sinclair Group's questioning of this being only about Iraq and not the others as well, is yet another valid point.  Koppel likes to claim this is a way to honor the dead. But why is honoring the dead thought by ABC and by Koppel, simply mourning their loss, and not honoring the values they placed above their own lives, as a matter of choice?  So what are Koppel's motivations, here? What are his intentions as regards the effect of his broadcast? I don't expect that the discussion over that point will ever end. Frankly, I have my doubts about his statements on the subject, myself.  Was it honoring the dead ABC has in mind? I doubt it, even ignoring the ABC network's long history of left-leaning, and muck-raking. This dual pronged approach has left the American people wary of so-called mainline news for years now and ABC is among the worst of the offenders. Let's take these dual prongs one at a time:  Even Koppel himself has suggested that Memorial Day might be a better time to honor these people, and their service. Yet he does it now, and not then. Perhaps it's just an interesting matter of random chance that this occurs during sweeps week,  and Memorial day doesn't fall into those parameters, I guess. I guess it is just another coincidence that Memorial day is traditionally abysmally low in terms of viewer numbers. People tend to be out of doors on that weekend.  All these factors coming together is just random chance, right? I mean, it couldn't be that doing this in the fashion it's done and in the time frame it was done in, just couldn't be merchandising of the war dead for commercial gain, could it?  As to the other prong; their left-leaning... What of the values these people died for? Is that story being told as well? No, it's not.  I would point to what I said last week, about our service men and women; Indeed, what I said last week was written partially in fear of exactly the chain of events that Koppel started; that the loss would be foremost, not what was accomplished as a result of the actions that incurred those losses, that what was accomplished would be overwhelmed, that the image being taken away was it was all for naught.  Those who fight don't think so.   I said at the time:      "They're all worthy of the very same respect, living or dead. Not because of their having lived or died, .... but because of their respect and understanding of the ideals that uniform represents. Ideals they hold highest. ... It is those ideals we should be holding high, as they did. We respect them not because they lived or died as a result of their service to our country, but because of the higher ideals they served.  We should hold them, ALL who serve us true, in our hearts."      How can we honor the dead without honoring what they have with their sacrifice, accomplished?   We cannot, in short, do so, because it was for those accomplishments that they gave their all. They considered those goals higher than that sense of self import we all carry around with us.  Further, consider this from the opposite side of the fence; Let's say we have a news cast willing to actually list the many accomplishments of the men and women serving in Iraq, including those who have died. Would this be considered pro-war bias? Then how can listing those who have died, without listing their accomplishments, be NOT considered as Anti-war bias? Along with the associated political biases based of the various candidates support or non-support for our actions, there, of course.  This is a point raised by FNC's Chris Wallace last Sunday, and it's a proper question to ask. I gather that Wallace will be answering that question, by showing us a list of those accomplishments on his show  next week. I, for one, plan to be watching.

      -East Syracuse, NY--  We're doing some more railfanning, today, sitting just outside the old Amtrak station in East Syracuse. This facility is an intermodal facility... not a very large one, but the biggest in the area, and along the old NYC water route, meaning 100-150 trains per day is not unusual, here. Too bad the weather's less than optimal for photographs. I've managed to find a pic of the spot I'm sitting in... well, close, anyway.  As I write this, I'm parked just to your right at the end of the guardrail.  We come here often.. it's a nice break for us and for the kids if we're traveling to the east along I-90 or to the north or south along I-81.     I've found this pic on Geno Daily's site,  urlLink which can be found here . His site shows quite a bit of the Water Route along through New York... a nice bit of work, and worth the visit. This picture is taken from on board the passing train. Essentially, you're standing in the near track looking at the station. The building's use as was discontinued in 1998 when a station was put up in Downtown Syracuse, about 15 miles west of here.  At the moment, the front lot of this building is being used to store new cars for a neighborhood Ford dealer. The building is looking a bit forlorn, though. Sad, really. A sad footnote in the annals of the excess of government in general and Amtrak in particular.  As I sit here, taking a break with a cold Root Beer, I'm reading the news in the local paper, and particularly the editorials they try to pass as news, I come to the conclusion that there's a lot of desperation on the left and in the press today. (OK, let's save time and space; we all know that with only a few exceptions, the press IS the left.)  The more I watch the leftists making noise about the reported Abu Ghraib prison abuse, the more I understand just how desperate for power they have become. And make no mistake, here, that's what this is all about. You'll hear a lot of wailing about 'honor' and so on. But that's not what this is about. All this noise about Iraq, has in fact little to do with Iraq, and more... in fact all, to do with power here in the US, and who gets it.  What this is, is Un-American leftists understanding that without the absolute worst happening in the Middle East, they stand no chance whatever of defeating the Republicans, and regaining the power they lost. To that end of regaining that power, the Democrats will stop at NOTHING. including fanning the flames of whatever Arab hatred that comes along, heedless of the longer-term consequences to America, or for that matter, to the world as a whole, to further that quest for power.  Some perspective allows for much in the way of backing for these statements. Let's look at several points:  Where has all the outrage from the left, over Daniel Pearl been? You do remember Mr. Pearl, right? Ah, yes, the one who had his throat cut... Some new info about that killing has come out in the last week; Apparently, Mr. Pearl was given the option of being sedated before he his throat was cut... which he refused. He knew for hours before his death he was to be killed. Apparently, the outrage for that has disappeared, even among his fellows in the press.   How about the four people dragged through the streets and hung from a bridge after being burned and decapitated? Where has the outrage gone for them? It has all but disappeared.  Of course we should not forget the unfortunate Mr. Berg. Where, again, is the outrage for that killing?  As with the others, it has become, for all intents and purposes, non-existent.  The supposed mainstream US press has been as silent on these topics as the Arab press has been.  But never let it be said that the the US press does not keep up the breast beating on prison abuse. Is the prison abuse of greater import than the islamo-facists crowd? One would think so, given the way the press is dealing with it.  For that matter, where is the feeling in the Arab world on these issues? Yes, you'll hear some on the Arab street complain as well about prisoner abuses, but stop and think for just a minute, here. Do you suppose there's anything that would get them to STOP complaining? I don't, short of capitulation, and a reinstatement of the Baathists. Do you?  (In fairness, perhaps it should be said about the Arab street that given the anti-American leanings of our own press, the true picture of the Arab street isn't making it to us, here in the States, and thereby to the rest of the world.)  About the only thing starker than the silence about abuses by Arabs on the rest of us by the left (and in this I include the press) is the utter lack of a plan to deal with the problem.   Oh, sure, John Kerry and the Democrats claim they have a solution. But here's a question you'll not get an answer to when you ask a Democrat: Do we have any evidence that what Mr. Kerry advises us to do... IE; turning it all over to the UN, will put us in any better shape? It's a question I can answer. No. In fact, the evidence if anything, suggests the situation would get worse if we follow his advice.  Ignoring, of course the fact that it was UN inaction and in fact UN corruption that brought us to this pass in the first place, there's two major problems with turning it over to the UN. First, the UN has it's own abuse issues.  Oh, I know... you've been busy, and not focused on such matters. Apparently, Mr. Kerry share your pain on that point; he's apparently as unaware of this story as you;  and it doesn't help that it seems to have gotten by the so-called mainstream press as well.  The source for this is the UN site itself.  "7 May 2004 – The United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) has launched a comprehensive investigation into reported instances of sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of civilians, including minors, by its personnel in Bunia, in the northeastern part of the country.   The Mission is determined to enforce Secretary-General Kofi Annan's policy of zero tolerance of any sexual misconduct, in accordance with his bulletin on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse of last October, a UN spokesman said in New York."  According to some sources, the UN has been aware of this abuse since last October, yet took no action. On this basis alone the UN deserves no trust in the Iraq matter. But let's remember, that the releases coming out of Iraq these days are targeting the UN in no uncertain terms. Small wonder, with their history. Let's take just a few examples:  Since North Korea is hot on the griddle these days,let's recall that North Korea starved to death about 2 million of its own people, while the UN did nothing.  Speaking of killing millions, let's recall Saddam Hussein's gassing of the Kurds and Marsh Arabs,  and screwing up their ecosystem so badly they will never be able to return.  And the business in the Sudan continues to this day. Ah, yes, the Sudan. Lovely vacation spot, that... Where something on the order of 2 million of Sudanese Christians have been killed in the last 15-20 years. At this moment, millions are under threat form the Sudanese government, and have been driven from their native lands under threat of mass murder.  Another UN vacation spot; Rwanda, where the UN witnessed the slaughter of around 800,000 Hutu and Tutsis, and did nothing.  Need I mention the UN's strong pro-terrorism stance, basically supporting attacks against Israel?  And since John  Kerry likes to rattle on about his time in South East Asia, perhaps a mention of the genocide of an estimated two million souls by the Cambodia's Khmer Rouge.  No, I don't think we can trust the UN to deal with the issue of Iraq and prison abuse, or in fact much of anything, for that matter. So much for Mr. Kerry's statements on the issue. There's just no way Kerry can really mean what he says about his ideas for the Middle East,  assuming he's not utterly insane, or that he's got the defeat of America and the west as a goal, or both. In which case of course, he has no business whatever in government at all, much less as the President.  Of course there's the Democrat rank and file who are just ticked that we removed the tyrant Saddam from power, and freed all those people.  Clearly these folks ARE insane. I've provided many examples of this type of idiot over the last few months.  Now that I think on it; the people all bent out of shape about our removing Saddam, including the UN, are also the ones who seemingly are not all that unhappy about the deaths of Americans Pearl, Berg, and all the rest. And guess what? They're all John Kerry supporters. That point alone tells us why the anti-war crowd is so very, very desperate, and why the deaths of these brave people mean so little, and why the name Abu Ghraib will be in the headlines until election day. Unless of course someone who has the power calls the press on their leanings.  Like, YOU, for example.

      -Churchville, NY -- I'm catching up on some railfanning... I gather from some online friends a rare bit of power is moving through in the next hour or two. Too bad it's raining this afternoon. The light is terrible for photo work.   Ah, well. At least I'm able to spend some time with my kids. My older boy in particular, is starting to get really sharp in his questions about life, and we've been talking today. One of the things we've been chatting about is the war in Iraq, and my thoughts on it. For one thing, he wanted to know what I had been thinking about the widely reported death of Pat Tillman. To explain that to him, I had to get into some detail on why we honor service to our country. It's amazing how little of that is taught in schools anymore.   For those who don't know, Tillman was an NFL player, and a pretty fair one at that. I don't need to tell you NFL players haul in money by the plane load. Tillman turned it down, instead going into the Army. He was killed in action near the Pakistan/Afghan border on Thursday.  I do have a question: What rock have you been under?  No, don't worry. I'm just commenting on the massive news coverage we've seen on this topic; the news media can't get enough of it.  I told him I'd already written about all of it in my Blog.  We chatted for quite a while about it all. I expressed to him, as I had in my Blog the other day about my discomfort with the coverage Tillman's death had gathered.  Don't misunderstand; I have a small mountain of respect for Tillman. I have sympathy for his family, his loved ones, his buddies in the field. I refuse, however, to be caught in the trap of regarding the death of this one soldier as being of greater impact than the death of any other. I will not hold the service of this one to be unequal to any other that serves us true.  I can understand why the press thinks this a special case, I guess. For example, I cannot dispute that Tillman gave up greater financial wealth to put on the uniform of his country, than most soldiers do. Tillman, if glory was what he was about could easily have covered himself with a sort of personal glory by remaining in the NFL.  So, certainly, he wasn't after the glory, as one I've written of elsewhere on this site for months now, would seem to have been. I don't call THAT true service.   Perhaps some historical perspective will help me to make my paint clearer.  I had occasion, recently to see "The Glenn Miller Story" again, just recently, and am now struck by the parallels, as I have been in the past. Miller put on his uniform because he thought he could do some good in his country's efforts against the Nazi threat. He ended up giving his life for his choice. Who knows where Miller's music would have taken him, had he lived out his natural life, instead of ending up at the bottom of the English Channel.  Like Miller, Pat Tillman's choice was about personal sacrifice, and of service... Service of an ideal he thought bigger than himself.  That kind of dedication is be cherished, certainly. But we must not allow ourselves to be swayed by the life position the soldier had, before he/she was a soldier, in our estimation of the value of that soldier.   Understand me clearly, please; The honoring of our vets has always held special meaning for me; it's a lesson my parents instilled very well, indeed. It was brought home to me, as I was recently looking at pictures from a trip we made through the Gettysburg PA area some years ago.  It's a particularly meaningful thing, when you're standing on that field.... something that goes well beyond the cold facts and figures about who died from what company, how old they were, or even where they were from. It's more a feeling you get.... you can sense it... not unlike being at Ground Zero in lower Manhattan, or visiting Arlington National Cemetery. I'm told Omaha Beach, and Pearl Harbor and many other sites are the same way. I've been at the funerals of firemen and policemen who died in their line of duty, and that was also remarkably similar.  In each case, we're dealing with places and concepts of death. But death alone doesn't do it; doesn't create that solemn atmosphere that is so unique to the above places. After all; there are lots of mass casualty accidents have happened over the centuries and their sites are well marked, and revered, or at least held apart, and yet, their impact doesn't approach that of an Iwo Jima or a Pearl.  Even under the shelter of the relative safety of the time that has passed since the events, as you stand in each place, you can still feel it; Lives were lost there that were willingly (And in the case of the civilian deaths at the towers, unwillingly) sacrificed toward a higher ideal.  Our feelings and conclusions can be far different from what those lost experienced. Yet, their lives and their sacrifices still count for something. And the thing is, it doesn't take much for us to out ourselves in their mindset.  Think of it this way; Every single man who died at Gettysburg, at Normandy, at Pearl and all he rest, and now in the Middle East, has meaning for us because each of them, had their own lives, just as we have our own lives.  These people loved, they laughed, they cried. They had a favorite food, a favorite color, a particular bit of music, or of poetry stirred their souls, like none other, just like we, ourselves. Every bit as much as you and I love our lives, they loved theirs. Their lives were as precious to them, as yours is to you. Their loss was as keenly felt by their loved ones as yours would yours. And yet, they gave their lives up, for something bigger.  I have a neighbor, whose father just recently needed a liver transplant. This neighbor willingly gave up part of his liver to be transplanted into his father. A noble action, certainly, commendable, and impressive. But with all respect to my neighbor, the choice to do that is comparatively easy to make. He knows and loves his father, and the sacrifice is fairly light by comparison.  How much more noble is a sacrifice of one's life for people that one will never meet?   Well, the Pat Tillmans of the world, gave of themselves for the benefit of people they would never know.... you and I, and countless others from many nations. If not for their sacrifices, you'd not be reading this BIT, because I'd not have written it.... we'd be living in a very different world, possibly, one not nearly as good to us as it has been.  Look upon those actions, those sacrifices, and know what you're seeing is strength, courage, and nobility in measures that should not... can not, be ignored. It must be honored by us all; it was made, after all for our benefit.  So how can we allow ourselves to be swayed by what position such people held prior to putting on the uniform of their country? Those things are simply not important. We must not allow that metric to guide us in the amount of respect shown them, be they living or dead after their service.   They're all worthy of the very same respect, living or dead. Not because of their having lived or died, not because of the amounts of money or positions they gave up, or what impact they had on us when they weren't wearing the uniform, but because of their respect and understanding of the ideals that uniform represents. Ideals they hold highest.     these are values I've been at some pains over the years to teach my boys as they grow up in this wonderful place called America. I fear that when and if we let these values pass away, America will, as well.  It is those ideals we should be holding high, as they did. We respect them not because they lived or died as a result of their service to our country, but because of the higher ideals they served.  We should hold them, ALL who serve us true, in our hearts.   And Tillman would be, I suppose, among the first to agree with my thought.  It should be pointed out that this respect is for those who serve us true, who hold to the ideas and ideals I've mentioned here.   I can think of one person in the public eye of late who has been making much political hay of his being in Vietnam... a time which by his own description, if not his admission, that his time did not amount to true service.   That's a choice made when he threw his medals back. I'm sure you know who I'm talking about.  I want you to think between now and November on the points I've written of here.   If we as a people believe that such values as I've expressed here need to be held high, and thus reinforced, then we have no alternative but to react in the negative when such values are not held high by those trying to claim glory and or power, under false pretense. The American people should react accordingly to that lack of service to those ideals, with a solid and irrevocable rejection. The service and sacrifice by those who did hold those ideals high, demands no less.   Such a person, holding and exhibiting no honor of those ideas and ideas,  has no place being Commander in Chief.

      Today, we were greeted with the sad news, that The Gipper, the Greatest President of the 20th century, Ronald Reagan, is gone from us.   Today, we remember a man, whose mind was filled with wide visions and positive actions.      The central figure in pulling down the iron curtain and ending the cold war...   The man who brought the 20th century to a close with America as the sole superpower...   The man who reminded America that it IS good, that freedom, a belief in God and personal responsibility are good things to be encouraged and cherished…   The man who exposed to us the great evil that communism represents, in all it’s forms....   The man who created the longest peacetime economic expansion in America’s history...   This great man of vision has for the last several years had those visions restricted to his room, and another days breathing, having been in seclusion on his BelAir home since the revelation in 1994 that he was suffering with Alzheimer’s.   In truth, at age 93, he’s now been on a long trip toward the exit for several years, and likely would have been anyway without the Alzheimer’s. The picture grew steadily worse, with him having fallen in the bedroom back in January 2001, and suffered a broken hip. He has been frail and bedridden ever since. He spent his time since then being fed, washed and cared for 24 hours a day by medical staff. Grand care, by a loving staff, I am sure, but he could not leave his bed, even for the most basic of functions. Nor could he make himself understood.   The specter of one whose spirit so positively affected us all, to be so trapped for so long, is hurtful to each of us, individually and as a nation, and as a culture. But, perhaps it will help us to remember, first, that that great mind, that great spirit, is now free again.   It will also help, I think to remember his words; he was a far more eloquent speaker than myself, after all. It is, perhaps somewhat symbolic that Mr. Reagan should pass on, on the day marking the 60th anniversary of D-day. It was on this day in 1984, that Mr. Reagan remarked:      "Mr. President, distinguished guests, we stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet of--or inches of sand, as bullets and shellfire cut through their ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, "Every man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero."   No speech can adequately portray their suffering, their sacrifice, their heroism. President Lincoln once reminded us that through their deeds, the dead of battle have spoken more eloquently for themselves than any of the living ever could. But we can only honor them by rededicating ourselves to the cause for which they gave a last full measure of devotion.   Today we do rededicate ourselves to that cause. And at this place of honor, we're humbled by the realization of how much so many gave to the cause of freedom and to their fellow man.   Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today. Others who hoped to return never did.   "Someday, Lis, I'll go back," said Private First Class Peter Robert Zanatta, of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, and first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. "I'll go back, and I'll see it all again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and the graves."   Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa Zanatta Henn, in a heartrending story about the event her father spoke of so often. "In his words, the Normandy invasion would change his life forever," she said. She tells some of his stories of World War II but says of her father, "the story to end all stories was D-Day."   "He made me feel the fear of being on that boat waiting to land. I can smell the ocean and feel the seasickness. I can see the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces--the fear, the anguish, the uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can feel the strength and courage of the men who took those first steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant death."   Private Zanatta's daughter wrote to me: "I don't know how or why I can feel this emptiness, this fear, or this determination, but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know is that it brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as a 20-year-old boy having to face that beach."   The anniversary of D-Day was always special for her family. And like all the families of those who went to war, she describes how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle: "So many men died. I know that my father watched many of his friends be killed. I know that he must have died inside a little each time. But his explanation to me was, 'You did what you had to do, and you kept on going.'"   When men like Private Zanatta and all our Allied forces stormed the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors, but as liberators. When these troops swept across the French countryside and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to take, but to return what had been wrongly seized. When our forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those who yearned to be free again.   We salute them today. But, Mr. President, we also salute those who, like yourself, were already engaging the enemy inside your beloved country--the French Resistance. Your valiant struggle for France did so much to cripple the enemy and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The French Forces of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit. They will be a timeless inspiration to all who are free and to all who would be free.   Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic peoples who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in a firm resolve to keep the peace.   From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible; now, in peace, that same unity makes us secure. We sought to bring all freedom-loving nations together in a community dedicated to the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance, forged in the crucible of war, tempered and shaped by the realities of the postwar world, has succeeded. In Europe, the threat has been contained, the peace has been kept.   Today the living here assembled--officials, veterans, citizens--are a tribute to what was achieved here 40 years ago. This land is secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and dying for.   Lisa Zanatta Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised that he would return to Normandy. She ended with a promise to her father, who died eight years ago of cancer: "I'm going there, Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments. I'll see the graves, and I'll put flowers there just like you wanted to do. I'll feel all the things you made me feel through your stories and your eyes. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor will I let anyone else forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud."   Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us today, a D-Day veteran has shown us the meaning of this day far better than any President can. It is enough for us to say about Private Zanatta and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside him four decades ago: We will always remember. We will always be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free."     Here's a few that caught my eye today:       "I've spoken of the “Shining City on the Hill” all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace, a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity, and if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it and see it still.   And how stands the city on this winter night? More prosperous, more secure, and happier than it was eight years ago. But more than that; after 200 years, two centuries, she still stands strong and true on the granite ridge, and her glow has held steady no matter what storm. And she's still a beacon, still a magnet for all who must have freedom, for all the pilgrims from all the lost places who are hurtling through the darkness, toward home.   We've done our part. And as I walk off into the city streets, a final word to the men and women of the Reagan revolution, the men and women across America who for eight years did the work that brought America back. My friends: We did it. We weren't just marking time. We made a difference. We made the city stronger. We made the city freer, and we left her in good hands. All in all, not bad, not bad at all..... "   ..."“Whatever else history may say about me when I’m gone, I hope it will record that I appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears; to your confidence rather than your doubts. My dream is that you will travel the road ahead with liberty’s lamp guiding your steps and opportunity’s arm steadying your way....”  "And so, good-bye, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America. "     Farewell, Mr. President. Ya done good.   Rest, now.

      Discussion time, as we head to the next election:  I've been called a great many things politically, most of them inaccurate.   But this subject came up elsewhere, and I thought I'd re-post my comments here, since it's as close as I've bothered to write to the subject of what constitutes the original purpose of government, and in fact what the actions of a legit government are.  I am not a conservative per se' not in the sense that we think of such today. I am, rather, a social conservative, which is a different animal altogether. I have a different view from any of the 'established' groups as to the legit purpose of government. That's because all of them have drifted away from it. And yes, I recognize this is NOT going to make me very popular. So be it. Any time you tell someone they're screwing up, you're not going to be popular with them.  So what is the purpose of government, anyway? No, I don't mean what it evolved into, I mean rather it's original purpose... the reason the concept of governments of any kind were even conceived of.  Some submit that government exists to protect privileges of a few, preserving a state of injustice for the majority.   Others hold the somewhat more optimistic view that the purpose of the state is to protect rights and to preserve justice. It appears to me that those questions form the arguments among the proponents of liberalism, libertarianism, socialism, conservatism and fascism, all at once.  I submit that all these four basic positions miss the point, because they generally don't remember who it was who invented the concept of government...government of any kind, I mean... in first place. I should point out that in general, the ones who get it the closest are conservatives, but they are not spot on, either.)  Libertarians, mostly suggest, along with Jefferson, that "No man has a natural right to commit aggression on the equal rights of another, and this is all from which the laws ought to restrain him.", and that therefore, government exists for only one purpose, and that is to secure the unalienable rights of its citizens against violation.   Well... This is fine as far as it goes, but it ignores who created the concept of rights, and it thereby misses utterly, the best path to protect such rights. In doing so it ironically denies it's adherents such protection.  And of course each of these groups has tended to abuse the power of government for their own ends.  To the end of answering overriding question of the purpose of government, (And thereby the question of what government needs to be doing today, and not doing, to remain legit) with any logic, we need to ask a few more questions:  1: Who invented the concept of government?  2: What purpose would that entity have had in such creation?  One way we can answer those two questions at once, would be to look at what existed as the most powerful force before government was invented, and therefore what was the most likely inventor of government: CULTURE.   If we make the logical assumption that governments were originally created by the individual cultures, then it follows that each culture constructed their respective governments in their own image... governments that best reflected and advanced each culture's interests.   The original purpose of government, therefore, is to protect, nurture and defend, and if possible expand the influence of, the culture that gave it life. As such, to the greatest of degrees possible, each government's laws, on the whole, were the culture, codified. It follows, then, that any government holding to the original purpose of government will perform this task.  Now, notice I said to the greatest degree possible. I freely admit... Trumpet, even, that there are no perfect governments, no perfect laws. No law, or government can ever capture in amber, a culture. Cultures are far more complex than any law, however written, can encompass. So it is that laws cannot be the end-call and be-all to a culture, or to a country. Laws when taken too literally and made to apply to all events uniformly, can instead of being just, will instead dispense injustice. It is said that in hell, there will be law and policy and little else. Yet, this imperfect tool did at least manage to provide a mechanism toward the intended purpose... The furtherance of the culture that founded said government. This understanding that there is imperfection in government implies that other values should supersede governmental power when the tool of government doesn't fit the task at hand well. I submit the highest value applied here should be the values of the culture, not that of the law.  (Which, I would argue is why there are judges which read not only the wording of the laws but then intent of them.)  Now, I hear some of you balking at this, suggesting the right of the individual are paramount; a noble sentiment. But consider this immovable fact:   Rights are not universal.   Yep. That's what I said...Read it again, just to be sure.  Rights are not universal.   Clearly, this will raise many questions on the part of some. This should answer most;  When Jefferson wrote that "WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE SELF-EVIDENT" he was not speaking a universal truth at all. The operative word in that phrase is "WE".   Rather than talking about a universal point of view, a universal truth, if you will, he was instead talking about the point of view of WE the new American culture. With this angle, many of the long-held myths about rights tend to disappear.  Consider; if it was in fact a universal truth that all men were created equal, it wouldn't have been such a radical idea, for the time, much less then to now. Last I checked, it is quite true that a vast majority still do not consider these as any kind of truth, universal or otherwise; they consider them to be anything BUT self-evident. Royalty still exists, as do class structures, and slavery, as well.   Again, I say...Jefferson was speaking of the point of view of OUR culture, not that of others.  The fact of the matter is that RIGHTS ARE A CULTURAL CONCEPT, and are nigh on meaningless outside that construct. Once the culture is allowed to fall to the law, even in an attempt to impose rights where they do not exist, what happens to real rights, which are a cultural concept?  When one says "freedom", the question should be 'freedom from what'? The answers that come back will invariably be cultural in nature. They do not make any sense outside that environment.  As I've said, the law and government has been abused by some, it has moved away from that intended purpose of supporting the existing culture. They are in fact being used by the left to alter that morality, to alter that culture, and when that happens, the fall of the government cannot be far behind... and the fall of the culture itself beyond that, becomes a larger possibility. Often as not, the downfall of that culture is what they have in mind.  That said, Culture is by far a more powerful force than government, over time. Indeed; Where governments have gotten themselves into problems over the centuries, is invariably where governments have tried to alter the culture artificially, by means of law. Culture eventually triumphs.   Take communism, as an example. Communism attempts to over-ride the culture and basically outlaw many facets of it.   But, (and this is important) everywhere you saw Communism.. Russia, Cuba, Korea, East Germany you saw the same treacherous *political* ideology, not the cultural values of those societies. And in those places where communism has been overthrown, the former USSR for example, the original culture invariably springs back to life.  This affects the concept of what is being called Multi-culturalism, as well. Governments that seek to mandate multi-culturalism do not last. Again, the USSR is a fair enough example.  Now, some would, because of those abuses as I mentioned, like to see all governments fall. They feel that governments have no legit purpose. I suggest this is short-sighted, and seeks, in the case of our republican form of government, to remove the only tool available to the end of supporting rights.   The worst of the abusers of government in our country, our culture, given these original purposes, are on the left end of the spectrum. The most visible American mainstream political group that works against these original purposes of government are the Democrat Party.  Now these are basics, and do not explore such things as taxes for example... and I'll do this at need. But I've given you much to chew on and respond to; which I will ask you to do; Discuss in the comments section, or (given the size limits on my comments section) send me an e-mail, and I'll post it from here as an update.

      I've got most everything I'd planned to put into BitsBits from the archives... looks like around 60 posts, now the 100 I mentioned before. Most of the difference is because the links in some of the older items are deadsville. (Shrug)  I've changed the links off the homepage to point both BitsBits and BitsBlog to the respective Blogspot addresses.   I've added Icons for both BitsBits and BitsBlog to the right column, so you can navigate between them.  I've left the old addresses up for a while, since the search engines haven't picked up the Blogspot addresses yet, and that's critical to hitcounts. I'll be deleting most of the Bits on the Roadrunner address sometime in the 3rd quarter.  I'll be turning on the Comments section soon as I figure out how to get the CSS adapted for the purpose.   Be sure to check out the extensive archive while on the BitsBits section. And drop me some mail with your thoughts.

       072504145930--Rochester, NY  It is, perhaps, fitting that this first column I’ve written directly to this new website, is being written as the Democrats are spinning up all systems in Boston for their coronation…. Errr… convention. The event, after all, provides us who are bloggers, with what can only be described as a target rich environment.   Well, frankly, it’s been somewhat less target rich than it might be. The assumed nominee, John Kerry, has been taking a decidedly low-key stance these last few weeks, apparently trying to give his detractors nothing to shoot at, so to speak. If you don’t say anything they can’t be critical of what you say. Thus the public debate over the worthiness of John Kerry for the office of President of these United States, and the validity of his stated policies, is once again strangled.   This kind of thinking apparently is also involved in the establishment of a so-called “Free Speech zone” which you see here. It’s so far away from the convention as to be laughable. There is no chance in hell the delegates will ever see this area, nor will they ever see the protests it contains… which in fact is it’s purpose. This is reinforced by the idea that the delegates aren’t even leaving Fleet Center for Meals; the DNC is providing. Apparently so they don’t interact with people who disagree with the DNC.    This point led to another protest from a local business owner, that I BitsBlogged about last week. The owner of one Pizza shop was forced to close his shop.. and left a sign on his shop, speaking his political mind. The Democrats are of course suing the owner, trying to get him to remove the sign… another attempt at the strangulation of protest.      It’s interesting to note that The Democrats, who have long complained about President Bush being isolated from the leftist Brownshirt Brigade, are now quietly about setting up and managing their own methods of strangling protest.  And isn’t that amazing? Consider that most forms of organized protest comes from the left…. Specifically, the FAR left. Think further; if the Democrats are so sure that they represent so great a number of people, how is it that they seek to stifle the free speech of those at the very root of their party?  Perhaps the Democrats are not willing to allow America to actually see and hear those at the root of their own party? People like these, for example, who showed up at the Funeral of President Ronald Reagan.:    Yes, my freinds, this is the heart and soul of the Democrat party. Undertsnadable why the Democrats don't want you, the voter, to see this just before an election. Then too, they decidedly don't want you to see it's the heart and soul of their party to be drawing comparisons between Mr. Bush and Hitler, such as:       And, given the ovberwhemling support for our militaryt and Mr. Bush's efforts in the Middle East, I suppose they're not interested in you seeing the heart and soul of their party calling for Murder within the ranks of our military.    In looking at this (and many others that didn’t make the cut for bandwidth reasons) one can readily understand why it is that the Democrats don’t want to have the voice of the people…. People they claim support them… gets out. A real image problem for The DNC, I think. Apparently, so do they.  But more, now… Word on the street is the REAL people are showing up;  Many, many pro-Bush protests are preparing to show up for the party… and they are decidedly an image problem for Kerry and Company. Folks like these, for example:     Perhaps the Democrat leaders are simply worried that their old friend… protest, will be used against them. Freedom, in their view, is apparently just ducky, so long is they come out on top.  The Democrats know that this week is all about image for them… and they need desperately, to control the image of them that is projected to the nation.  Which raises an interesting, and perhaps the central question for the next week;   Who will find themselves restricted to the ‘free speech zone” in Boston”?   Will it be the protestors bought and paid for by Millionaire George Soros? Will it be the members of Move-On.org,  Or will the population of that so-called “Free Speech Zone” be limited to those, both left and right, who would cause red faces at the DNC, if their voices were actually allowed to be heard by America?   Oh.. and as a side note, what of the Union Picket lines? Are these not protests? After all, if the picket line is in the “Free Speech Zone” Democrats don’t have to cross the picket line.  Looks like by the end of this week, the Democrats with their actions and their double standards, will have provided us with a few targets, after all.

      Living along the southern shore of Lake Ontario, one is presented with a number of unique places to experience. One of them is, to my understanding the only Amusement park of any serious size along the south shore... SeaBreeze Amusement Park, which is just outside Rochester.  The Seabreeze of today is sort of the last man standing.   Rochester had several amusement parks years ago that one thought about spending their time at. 25 years ago, one had  urlLink Roseland,  southeast of Rochester in nearby Canandaguia, and Olympic Amusement Park  in the town of Chili (pronounced Cha eye-l-eye, if you're a local)  Roseland and Seabreeze were by far the older... Olympic was the upstart. Olympic had rides that were designed to travel around to state fairs and whatnot, whereas the other two had a sense of permanency about them.      urlLink  Seabreeze had a Merry Go Round  built by the Philadelphia Toboggen Company (PCT #36). Inside the Round-House was a Wuriltzer style 165 band organ that was a wonder to listen to. It's pictured above. That organ and the "round were mated at birth; both having been built and purchased  in 1926.     They also have a wooden coaster.. a largish out and back created in 1920, called the Jack Rabbit... an intense ride even for today. It's pictured here a few years ago. I've been on that ride perhaps 100 times over the years... and it still scares the hell out of me.  Roseland was older by a few years, and most of it's rides and attractions had a somewhat older feel to them. It's 'round was also created by PTC. Number 18 was built in 1909. Roseland closed nearly 25 years ago, and Olympic closed at more or less the same time. Of the two Roseland was by far the more memorable for most folks; I can't even find any pictures of Olympic as it was to show you.  Roseland's 'round currently lives about 60 miles east of it's original spot, inside the Carousel Mall in Syracuse.  urlLink Here's a few pics of it in the new location.    All that's left of Olympic is a bowling alley.   Someone tried to put a water park on Roseland's site a few years ago, but it never did work; the owners were always fighting the memory of how grand the place used to be... and the new place could never measure up to that memory. It's abandoned, as far as I know... what of it wasn't taken up by high priced apartment complexes filled with people wanting a shoreline view of Canandaguia Lake.  Those closings left Seabreeze all alone in the Rochester Market, which in turn gave rise to the Darien Lake megapark, at Corfu, NY about 20 miles west of Rochester, which is now owned by the Six Flags people.  As for Seabreeze, on  March 31, 1994, came the worst. I never thought I'd have a practical use of my recording of Todd Rundgren of "Were you there when the Carousel Burned Down", but I did, that day. The fire was started about 3 p.m. by contractors who were working to re-tarring a roof. An hour later, PTC 36 and the Wurlitzer, 100 rolls of music and all... nothing of it was left but ashes, and a column of smoke that could be seen for 30 miles. Being positioned directly across the street from the firehouse didn't help at all; it was gone at the first spark. Local stories said the firemen were crying, some of them, trying unsuccessfully to put the fire out. It took an emotional toll on them, the local news said at the time.   I remember looking out of my downtown office window and wondering what that column of smoke to the north was, and not understanding that one of my memories would now never be anything more than that... And a place of the entire area's collective consciousness, was dying. Even when told by co-workers what was up, it didn't hit me.  Until, that is, later that night. I remember driving past the park that night, to get an idea of how bad the damage was. It was dark by the time I got by there.  But I recall being taken back at the sight. I leaned on my horn in a salute to the pile of ashes as I sat in front of the place, my headlights playing on what was left of that ancient frame of PTC36 as I sat on the edge of the park grounds.  In doing so, I happened to catch the eye of someone else, who apparently was there for the same thing... sitting in his car, his young wife with him. He simply nodded at me, and joined in, giving a blast from his horn, as well. He understood, and shared the loss. I'll never know his name, but it doesn't matter.  I can think of a number of  people  that wouldn't get that kind of reaction. I certainly can't think that any MegaPark such as Darien Lake would ever attain that kind of status within the community. Perhaps because it's not been there long enough, but also possibly because as loud, gaudy and intense as it gets, it's never really as comfortable as some of the older parks this country has to offer... Seabreeze among them.  Fortunate, that the owners of Seabreeze understand that factor, and take such pride in their park. and the idea that they've been there for 125 years this year, and plan to be there for many years to come. They rebuilt the ride, and the organ, all to the original specs, from the original drawings, all with handcrafted care.  The cost must have been several million dollars. The 'Round of today... well, all you can say is, it's a real beauty.  OK, I know it's a long lead in, over half this column, in fact...but I say all of this because you need to understand the background, to understand where I'm going with this.  You see, I had the chance yesterday to take part in the company picnic, which, as it has been for the last few years, was at Seabreeze.   Now, I've been going to Seabreeze (yes, along with the other parks, too) for the last 40 years and more. So, in many ways, it's attained the status of an old friend. It did my heart good to see my old friend looking well, and fit, and well cared for. After all, I'd seen a couple friends like this wither and die away, already. The Seabreeze folks obviously take pride in caring for my old friend.   One of the first places the boys wanted to stop was the newly rebuilt 'Round. I found myself being a little sad going into the new 'round. I had to sit and think about why, though.   A Merry Go Round, particularly as beautiful as this rebuild is, making me sad? Rather an unexpected response. I found myself having to stop and think about why this was. The result of that thinking is the reason I'm writing all of this today.  You see, yesterday, in all the activity, I re-discovered the emotions surrounding my seeing my two boys' delighted smiles, as they discovered and enjoyed the very same rides I enjoyed as a child of their ages. The reaction, the feeling, the emotions surrounding that event are as powerful as any I've ever had. There's something of a feeling of, well... of permanency, of a continuance of sorts... And for just that brief, powerful moment, I found myself, looking at myself, 40 years ago. I now understand a bit more of my own parents.  Heady stuff, this.  But for the 'round, as nearly perfect as it's replacement is, that emotion is gone. In some ways, it's like a first love; You never quite love a woman the same way again, as you did your first. You can marry, and find that one true love and yet, in many ways you're always affected by the memory of the first. Sadly, it can never be again.   It's all that and more; and understand, please, I don't mean at all to slight the efforts of the Seabreeze folks; they've done the best anyone could ever have done. I and the remainder of the community are forever grateful to their efforts in rebuilding 36, and the organ.   Thing is, though, I'll always feel a twinge of sadness when entering the new structure, for the one that was lost, because I can't tell my kids "I rode on this when I was your age". I'm sorry, gang, I can't help it. I find myself shocked at how important that one point is to me.  I know things happen, and changes come. But I think I begin to understand what places like that mean to a soul, and what preservation of our landmarks means to us both individually, and as a community.  At least Seabreeze's ownership was thoughtful and foresighted enough to understand that new memories count nearly as much as old ones, and then providing for them, by rebuilding.  They understand that old memories, precious as they are, cannot die when the edifices involved in those memories do. and new memories need a place to be made, as well. This new 'round, Lord willing, will be around for my boys to watch THEIR kids on, 20 years hence.  I had a passing thought as I watched my youngest on his last turn of the day on the Bear Trax, the kiddie sized Coaster..... I wonder if those Islamofacists seeking our destruction, will ever care about, much less understand, that emotion.   I doubt it. What exact connection that has with the future of America, in light of our current struggle with terrorism, is not fully clear to me. But I can't help but feel strangely reassured tonight as I write this, about our future. It's not just our armies, our police and our financial institutions they're fighting against. They certainly tried to hobble us by attacking these.  What they fail to reckon with, however, is it's our Amusment parks as well, and the emotions we experience inside them, and for that matter, all the places, everywhere we get a sense of our cultures and our families, continuing. Those are an enemy which in my view, they will never understand, much less defeat.
