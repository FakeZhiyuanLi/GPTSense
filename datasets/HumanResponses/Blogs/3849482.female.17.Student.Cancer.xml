      I haven't updated in awhile... a lot has been going along, even if I am bored all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Saturday, I went on a campus tour of the College of New Jersey.&nbsp; It's funny how colleges are described differently by different sources.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as a person who can be somewhat gullible, I have come across a dilemma.&nbsp; I mean, it is obvious that the tour guide and staff of the college will try to convince prospective students of attending, but at the same time, wouldn't they have a better perspective on the school than a book full of statistics and quotes from select individuals? *sighs*&nbsp; Who knows?  Besides, I  still  have no idea as to what I want to major in... Dale says English, Carolyn has always said fashion design, and my parents constantly come up with random (yet "stable") professions that I'm not sure if I would even be good at, but the one person who should know which major I should choose does not know...&nbsp; College is already upsetting me and I have a whole year before it actually starts.  Today I taught my first violin lesson.&nbsp; It wasn't great, but I suppose it could have been worse.&nbsp; I wish I didn't have so much work over the summer.&nbsp; It probably is one of the main reasons as to why I never feel like doing anything.&nbsp; It tires me out so that I either end up sleeping "early" or falling asleep in the middle of the afternoon.&nbsp; :`(&nbsp; I really hope I go  somewhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't even care too much as to where, but I need a break.&nbsp; After all, wasn't that the point of having a summer vacation?

      I'm a genuine Cancer and I know it...  It's ironic how something as simple as a zodiac sign can tell someone everything they want to know about me, even the characteristics I try to hide the most.  I have low self esteem, but I wonder if other people see that as me being snobby instead.  If that is how others view me, I wish they wouldn't... but I cannot blame them because I am sure that I mistake the insecuritiy of others as over-confidence, as dumb as it may sound.  Although I'm sure that being a Cancer has nothing to do with it, the reason for my low self esteem actually is body image.  I'm in a fat mood as I often am- it's not a great feeling if you know what mood I am referring to.  I eat when I'm not hungry and I am angry with myself because I do.  I know I'm not "fat" per se, but I do have this strange inborn fear of gaining too much weight.  When I was little, I read that Cancers were supposed to have a love of food, and ever since then, I've been self conscious.  I guess this may explain a lot to some people.  I do not like sounding so superficial though.  *sighs*  I can't explain it.  In ninth grade, I did a project on eating disorders.  People with anorexia had so many symptoms that reminded me of myself.  They were people who obviously were not happy with themselves, were usually overachievers with this need to please others.  Because they felt that weight was one of the few things they could control, however, they decided to focus on being the skinniest or lightest for themselves rather than for others.  Don't worry, I know that I am not anorexic nor will ever be anorexic... unless it is merely a state of mind, in which case, I should be considered one. *ponders*  Well, anyway, I am planning on losing weight while staying healthy at the same time.  ^_^

      Actually this summer isn't that fun for me, besides driving, of course!  ^_^  ehehehe... this might not be the best time to say this, but I've never driven at night before I passed the driving test, so I don't really know what I'm doing when I drive at night.  (I'm sure Dale could figure this out anyway, though...)  Yesterday, I saw "Spider-Man 2" a second time since Dale still hadn't seen it.  There was this weird line in the middle of the screen throughout the entire movie and it was really bothersome, but besides that, the movie was great (obviously)!  Before the movies, I went to the Short Hills Mall with Dale and bought a bathing suit!  After the trip to the mall, Dale and I ate pizza at Romanelli's with Amy and Krysti.  Sadly, I now do not have much money left so I am awaiting my paycheck, which is supposedly arriving on Thursday, with much anticipation!  On Saturday, I didn't accomplish anything because I was working at the snack bar for almost five hours.  I   did  get a two dollar tip though!  ^_~  On Friday, I watched "King Arthur" with Krysti and Jess M.  We knew that the movie didn't have good reviews beforehand, but oh well...  The moral of this is: don't see bad movies and save money!  Okay, okay, so the movie wasn't   bad  , but it wasn't good either.  Today, I'm just hoping I'll do something later or have something to look foward to doing...  -_-;;

      It was my birthday yesterday and although it may not make sense to most people, a birthday isn't always a happy occasion for me.  I always have mixed feelings, like I'm not really happy at all... but I suppose I know why.  I'm not even sure if I   am    capable of growing up or even if I am, I would much rather repress it.  I can't bear to leave childhood, yet I know that if I do not, I may end up missing out on more in life.  I wish everything could just be one-sided.  It would be easier if I never had to try to sort out my emotions.  Yesterday, I passed my driving test!  ^__^  I was really nervous and quite surprised that I passed since I know it definitely was not the best I have ever done, but I am   so    glad that I did.  The wait for actually obtaining my license was incredibly long.  It was over an hour and a half and I kept thinking about how I could be do something more productive, like reading.  (Speaking of which, I have to read a lot more for English class.)  After I returned home with my new license, I went to Jose's Mexicana Cantina with Amy and Jess R.  It was funny because we were confused over the waiters who had looked similar at first, until we realized that they did not look alike at all.  We had the special ice cream dessert that customers get to celebrate birthdays.  I know it's odd, but I   loved    the candle they put in it.  It was in the shape of a crayon and was so cute!  While we were eating dinner... Jess, as usual, scared me.  She never seems to be embarassed to do certain things in public.  She asked a waiter what "papi" meant since she had heard someone call their son that when she had thought it was what a woman was supposed to call her husband.  Then, when the check arrived, Jess wrote her brother's cell phone number on the back.  -_-;;  I'm afraid of going back to Jose's for awhile since Amy and I go there pretty frequently and Jess never does.  The waiters probably think that   I    wrote the number.  Then we went to Blockbuster and rented "The Butterfly Effect" since Jess stated how it was such a great movie.  Amy and Jess were again   joking    (I hope) about setting me up with one of the people working there.

      Today it finally felt like summer!  I don't know how to describe it, but after school ended, vacation just hasn't been like a vacation.  I mean, yes, of course I have been feeling lazy and not accomplishing much, but I've been like that since spring. -_-;; Sad, I know, but what can I do besides try to be better?  Anyway, my point is that I had so much fun today!  In the morning, I drove my parents on route 22 , which everyone says is the worst place to drive, though I've never really minded it.  I was dropped off at Borders where I read manga.  >.  horrible   at making decisions, I didn't buy any.  *sniffles*  I'll need someone to tell me which series to collect!  Then, in the afternoon, I went to the Livingston mall and shopped like the mall rat I am!  Sales are soooo awesome!  ^__^  While I was at Borders, I spent an hour and a half reading the first and most of the second Kare Kano manga because Mercs had told me about the series before she moved.  I liked it, thought I will have to admit that it's very different from the type of manga I normally read, mostly because it seems quite a bit more lighthearted- the issues involved, at least.  I did discover that I have this weird tendency to like characters that have a history.  (hehe, Arima is a potential candidate for my anime harem...)  Another reason why I enjoyed Kare Kano is because the main character, Yukino, is so much like me that it's scary.  It's almost as if there were a series printed about me!  *gasps*  Well, I know we aren't exactly alike, but the few similarities we share certainly are unnerving.  For one thing, I am a comletely different person at home than I appear at school.  I live like a slob!  For another, I  am  a perfectionist and I am competitive when it comes to academics.  I also do enjoy praise and though I'm not sure as to whether or not everything I do is   for   praise like Yukino, it could be.  I do become jealous easily and I'm not sure if I am a fraud, but I very well may be one if I seemingly lead double lives.  I know, not a very flattering picture of myself, but who knows?  It could be more accurate.

      For various reasons, I am returning to xanga, lol.  Yes, one of them is because  Mercs  is evil and doesn't ever look at my sites anyway, you huge, huge, huge meanie!!!!  :P  Also, I'm not really sure how to customize this site and customization is vital in having an online journal, for me, anyway.  My new site is :  urlLink http://www.xanga.com/home.aspx?user=starry_eyed_firefly   But maybe I will continue to post here at times since xanga is in no way private, and barely anyone knows about  this  journal, hehe.  Bye for now!

      Eh... I haven't updated in the longest time... I have so much and so little to write about. Argh, I'm very frustrated.  I watched "Mystic River" with Amy tonight. It was quite depressing, but good nonetheless. And then, of course, Amy made me paranoid before I had to drive home... evil Amy. We discussed criminals posing as cops, people hiding under cars waiting for their victims, and people who have found ways of sneaking into the backseat of cars...  Anyway, my trip home wasn't too bad. I did encounter a couple of interesting things though, such as a dead deer and a blue flip flop.  So, for the most part, I'm as paranoid as can be and proud of it! ...  Oh, I've also been introduced to DDR (Dance Dance Revolution), a PS2 game, for which my cousin is famous for in our town. I'm pretty horrible, but hopefully I can improve. Hehe, my cousin says he lost 17.5 pounds from it, so maybe I can lose weight too! Well, either that or maybe I'm just being way too optimistoc today.  I had my senior picture taken today, although I'm not in the least photogenic, so I doubt it went very well.  *frowns*  Also!!!!  I almost forgot to mention that my relatives are here.  My uncle, grandmother, and two of my cousins are currently living at my house, so there's always someone home.  ^_^
