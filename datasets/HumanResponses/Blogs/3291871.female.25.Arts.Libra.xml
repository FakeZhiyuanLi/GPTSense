      I thought I'd be good at this blog thing.  But I guess I'm not.  I can't even get a picture on my blog! :-(  If I could, I would put a picture of Poco a Poco up!!!!  Because he is huge and you should all see him!  He's awake right now.  He is so cute I could eat him up.  But that scares Mike when I pretend to put him in my mouth.  Hee hee.   Halle Berry is so beautiful.  There is an ant crawling on the wall behind my computer right now.  It is not so beautiful.   I'm going tonight to work with the Central Point Teen Actors again for their production of  Into the Woods .  Man, those kids need help.  I can't believe they keep attempting these major musicals without a musical director.  Well, not so major.  They've done  Grease  and  You're a Good Man Charlie Brown .  Kids musicals.  But still.  Both of those were...not so good.  I applauded them for their guts and their effort.  But they were so painful to watch at times.  So when Aaron (my student who is playing piano for them this time) told me they're doing Into the Woods I said PPPPPlllllllleeeeeeeasssssseeeee let me help out. You need me. (which he did, since he had fallen into role of musical director and had no clue what he was doing) So I'm donating my time.  Time I don't really have.  But I have one week right now between  Sweet & Hot  and  Fantasticks , so why the hell not?  I mean, really, what else would I do in the evenings this week if I wasn't going to rehearsals?  Relax?  Practice?  Yeah, that'd be smart.  But I'm not usually smart.  And besides.... I HAVE to do this.  Being a musical director for community theatre is something i NEED to do.  Why I have not quite figured out.  Certainly not for the pay.  Oh dear.  I am $400 overdrawn right now and my  Sweet & Hot  salary check bounced.  Nobody's makin' money here.  So sad.  But this time will pass.  I have strong support for  urlLink Connect the Dots  (the company I am resident musical director for) and feel they will pull out of this current hole.  Stupid  Little Shop of Horrors  for not making any money. Gggggrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!!  Thank God for my sweet husband Mike and his lovely stable career.  :-)  If it weren't for him I'd still be living in my shed in Jacksonville.  But that's not why I married him.  I don't know how it works when two musicians or artists or actors marry each other.  Besides just the financial aspect, there's so much....drama...tied up in the artistic world.  Emotions are so close to the surface.  They have to be.  And I like it that way.  I wonder if anyone reads my blog.  Maybe I should tell more people about it.  But that would be weird.  It'd be like "hey, come read about me and my random ramblings!"    love Meagan

      I want to cry.  In fact, I think I will.  I discovered Saturday night that I have no serious piano pieces in my current repertoire.  How pathetic is that for a full-time musician with a degree in classical piano performance?  I can't play anything except musical theatre.  Here's the story... Jacob was here and we were just playing in my studio Saturday night.  We were playing Christmas duets, he on the student melody line and I on the teacher part. (Yes, I know it's May.)  He commented how he'd never heard me play any classical pieces.  So after much hemming and hawing (what a stupid phrase--where'd that come from?) I decided to play Debussy's Poissons d'or from Images book 2.  This whole book I performed from memory several times a few years ago.  Yet I sucked.  After about two pages I gave up in embarrasment.  He said it was great, but I know it wasn't.  And don't tell me I'm being too hard on myself.  Then I played a Chopin nocturne that I learned for my students' recital several months ago.  That wasn't quite as pathetic.  Pathetic.  And I'm actually considering graduate school right now.  Right.  love Meagan

      It's been a few days since I've written.  That's okay.  I promise not to be one who updates this blog every hour.  Those people scare me.  Besides, I still don't even know if anyone really reads this ever besides David and Erin (by the way, how did you guys get links to other blogs on the border of yours?)   A day off?  A day off!  That's what today's been!!  And it's been oh so lovely.  I have not even had a little bit of a day free since the beginning of March, let alone a whole day.  So I took great advantage of it.  No, I didn't do anything exceptional; I just relaxed.  I was supposed to be doing   Fantasticks   auditions from 11-4 and   Les Miserables   callbacks from 5:30-9 today and that was my whole day filled up.  But     both     of those got rescheduled for next Saturday!  Yay! Yay!  My excitement is not an exageration.  This was a day greatly needed.  So here's what I did (since I'm sure you want to know...I hope my sarcasm comes through okay throughout this blog!):  I slept in until 8:30 and then I read a magazine in bed until 9:30.  Then I sat at my 'puter for a bit doing nothing really substantial and ate a muffin and drank lots of 100% juice organic orange juice that Mike went all the way to Fred Meyer just to get for me this morning because last week I was moaning the icky 10% juice they sell at Starbucks.  At 10 it hit me that   Fantasticks   rehearsals start in a week and a half and I haven't even looked at the music at all.  So throughout all day I spent a lot of time working on that.  So yes, I was working, but not really because new music is always exciting.  It's just when you've been working on a show forever that it gets tedious. At noon Mike and I went to my parents house since my mom is still housebound I try to go whenever I can.  We brought over   The Fantasticks   movie since I needed to watch it (yes, still sort of like work.  Oh well, that's the way it is) and I knew my mum would love it.  FYI The Fantasticks movie sucks.  It is so not like the stage musical.  If anyone has seen the movie and not the live musical please don't judge it by that!  Anyway, continuing on the journey of my lovely day.  On our way home we saw a bunch of kids from our church doing a car wash at Food 4 Less.  They were washing a huge tour bus. Poor kids.  We didn't help.  We just stopped to visit.  Ha.  I had Poco with me because I'd taken him for my mum to see, so the kids all loved that too.  It was cool (yeah, I know, I'm just being so literary and fascinating with words tonight, aren't I?).    Well, there was more to my day.  And more that I could write.  But I just realized how boring this probably is.  So rather than delete and start over (it is 1:41 a.m. after all) I'm just going to stop there and leave you wondering in suspense over what I did for the rest of the day and evening.  Big secrets.  love Meagan

      wow.  I have a lot I want to write right now.   But more than that, I have a man I want to kiss a lot right now.  Therefore I must wash my face and go to bed.  Good night blogger!    I'll try to update on the excitements of all my musicals tomorrow!  love Meagan

      ..."never know your luck when there's a free-for-all"  The above is my current favorite lyric from Les Miserables.  It reminds me of Sweet & Hot.  Yes, I've got to complain about Sweet & Hot once more.  Just once more.  Well, we still have three shows to go, so it might be more than once.  So David E. Weck, read with discretion.  I think you're the only one in this production that might read this.  But you probably agree with all I'm saying anyways. And you'll know that anything insulting I might type probably doesn't apply to you!  Right?  All happy.  Good.  (HI JACOB!  WE'RE ON THE PHONE RIGHT NOW AND WHEN YOU READ THIS TONIGHT YOU CAN SAY "HEY KOOL SHE WAS TALKING TO ME WHILE WRITING THAT AND I WAS IN THE LOUNGE TALKING TO RUBY.")  So Sweet & Hot.  Still subtitled "Sucks & Sucks".  But it is getting better every single show.  In fact, that's quite nice.  The cast sems to be loosening up, starting to interact with the audience some.  The weirdest thing I think is during the dance breaks, whether solo or everybody, they just silently go through the steps.  It's not that it's un-energetic, it's just...un-emotional.  Yeah, that's it.  There's no emotional involvement.  But why should there be?  I don't think the director did any sort of character development with the cast at all.  Yes, it's just a bunch of random songs loosely pasted together with a wimpy plot of sorts.  I did something really notnice at a rehearsal for this show recently.  I was so frustrated with the whole process at that moment that I wrote down all the things I could think of that were being done wrong (in my so very unhumble opinion).  Even though I would only share some of the things on my list with someone if they asked, it was still notnice of me to even put it down on paper and out of my head before I exploded.  Many of the things had to do with director/musicaldirector relationship or just the musical director's process.  I waffle (waffle--such a great verb!!) between being so glad I wasn't musical directing this and being so frustrated and working hard to keep my mouth shut since I'm not musical directing this.  Anyway.  Enough about that.  Katie, you mentioned wanting to come see "Into the Woods."  I'm not actually musical directing or performing in it...I'm just doing some emergency help.  (How do you know about this show, by the way?)  Crater is doing it and it's so sad how all the other high schools in this area do pretty decent musicals and my hometown is so pathetic.  My piano student Aaron is accompanying for them (which he does perfectly wonderfully okay) and at his first rehearsal he realized he was basically musical directing too as they have no other musicians/conductors involved.  And he's never done any theater before.  So as good as each individual seems to be, this show is definitely struggling.  Not to call myself any kind of expert, but I do think I'm a pretty decent musical director and it's nice to be able to come in as an outside person, be efficient, skilled, and immediately make things happen.  So that's been fun.  I went to one rehearsal last night (they only have two-hour rehearsals...that's something I'm going to suggest changing soon!) and will go a few times more next week after Sweet & Hot closes and before Fantasticks rehearsals start.  That one week I had a couple free evenings.  Oh well.  In Production and about to close: The Matchmaker (SOU/MD/recorded pianist) Little Shop of Horrors (CTD/MD) Sweet & Hot (CTD/accompanist)  In Rehearsal: Into the Woods (CPTA/guest MD) Carousel (RMT/I'm not really doing anything with this but I've been consulting with their MD a lot and I helped with auditioning/casting so it feels like I'm involved still)  Casting: Les Miserables (CTD/MD)  Auditioning: Fantasticks (CTD/MD)  Am I crazy?  Most people do one show at a time.  How is it that I am suddenly involved in, like a million and three shows?  Well that's what it seems like at times.  The times when I can't keep straight what song's from what musical.  It just requires me to pay more attention I guess.  And give up on trying to keep my house clean.  Ooooh.  That's hard for me.  New subject again.  So yay yay yay for Katie posting a comment!!!  I hope she read about herself in my first entry!  And yeah, I think it's weird too when people get really really personal in these things.  I bet it'd be a really interesting social psychology experiment to study the dynamics of why and what people type in a publicly online journal.   I guess it's cool that you can say whatever you want, but nobody should expect anything really juicy from me.  Just so you know.  :-)  Every now and then I might feel...voyeuristic.  But in general I'm sure my journal will be like "this is what I did today.  I had ice cream.  Yum."  Yeah.  Exciting stuff liike that.  And on and on and on about musicals.  Next time I think I'm going to talk about my mom.   love Meagan

      I went on a date with my pop tonight.  It was wonderful and sweet and fun and special and all around good.  I sure do love him lots.  It was a big formal banquet in Eugene for the Oregon Fire Chiefs Association.  So basically a long program of boring awards and stuff I know nothing about but that is very important to him.  And since my mum is way too sick to even leave the house he asked me if I wanted to go.  It was fun to have a reason to dress up in clothes other than black performance clothes and schmooze with a bunch of people I don't know.  that's all for now.  I've been to Eugene and back (total 5.5 hours driving) this afternoon/evening.  Sleepy.  Tomorrow I'm going to a siskiyou piano institute workshop with Mark Levine called "Teaching Jazz Piano for Classical Teachers."  $5!  What a deal!  Then at 2:30 we have yet another round of auditions for Les Miserables.  I love auditions.  More on that later.  love Meagan

      The power of Blogger!  This evening at approximately 6:45 I read in "My New Friend Erin's" blog that tonight is Sonya's senior recital.  And by 7:15 I was out the door.  Were it not for Erin's blog, I wouldn't have even thought to go to the recital hall tonight to listen to an AMAZINGLY WONDERFUL vocal concert.  And I'm so glad I did!    It's rare for me to have a free evening.  "Sweet & Hot" opened Sunday and "Matchmaker" opened tonight (the two shows I was rehearsing for) so this Wednesday evening I really truly was planning to stay home.  So much for that.  I really don't like staying home.  I really need to work on the scores for "Into the Woods," "Les Miserables," and "The Fantasticks" for upcoming rehearsals, but it's not everyday I get to be out with friends so I've gotta take those opportunities when they come!  Right? And besides, I was at a classical voice recital.  That could be considered research.  It's not like I just went to the movies to see, say, "13 going on 30" (which, by the way, is a movie I really want to see.  Yeah, I know, that really shows you the depth of my cinematic choices.)  After the concert I went out with Jacob and Erin and I was so glad I went to the concert just for the opportunity to hang out with them.  Jacob and I got to be really close friends really fast and those kind of friendships sometimes scare me because they have a tendency to end as fast as they start.  And I don't want that to happen with him.  I hope it doesn't.  But I don't know how to stop it from fading away.  I still haven't figured out if it's just me, or just the way some friendships are.  Either way, I don't like it.  I hope we stay friends for a long time and keep getting to know each other more and more, even as new people come and go.  We have a lot in common as far as music goes and just having fun together and he's interested in God-stuff, so with those two topics we always have lots to talk about.  Note the title of this entry.  That's because everyone at our table at the bar tonight (besides myself, Jacob, and Erin) were smoking and I had to smell myself in the car the whole way home.  My first priority was to take a shower as soon as I got home (well, after saying hello to Poco and Madeline).  Does that make me obsessive-compulsive?  I mean, really, I live with a smoker (my husband Mike).  You'd think the smell wouldn't bug me.  But Mike only smells like smoke immediately after actually smoking.  When a bunch of people are smoking in a room like tonight it really sticks to clothes, hair, everything.  Grrrrrr.  Another way going out tonight was really just as productive as staying home and practicing----I met a guy at Alex's Bar that plays bass and is really interested in playing for me in "Les Miserables."  Yay!!!!  I've been hiring musicians for that this week so it is perfect that I met this guy.  I just hope he's good.  After all, hiring someone you just met over martinis (me) and beer (him) isn't really the most responsible job interview.  But hey, we're "artistes!", that's the way it's done!  I love my job.  Hey, Friends!!!!  I hope you'll give me a little comment when you read this, so I know you found it.  Just once.  Then if you're bored and never read again, well that's okay too.  Does it sound like I'm begging?  Oh well.  love Meagan

      I'm thinking my blog needs a name.  When I created it I didn't realize MAGN would be like a big bold title at the top every time.  I just thought it was the name I'd use to log in.  So MAGN is boring.  I tried to take a quiz online (at quizilla.com...stupid website, rarely works) titled "What Kind of Obscure Latin Phrase Are You?" or something like that.  If the silly website had actually been working, perhaps that would have given me a fun title!  Obscure latin phrase.  Whatever could that mean?  Sounds fun.  "Muchos Gracias" Restaurant aka "Big Thanks"  I guess that's not obscure.  But it was really funny when Tanya said it last night.  Then there's the other local Mexican eatery--"Si Casa Flores" aka "Yes House Flowers" Thanks Shane for that enlightening translation. ?????????  So I sent out a bunch of text messages last night to some of ...ummm...internet-savvy friends (as opposed to those who are like "blog?  wtf?") telling them about my blog.  So dear buddies vanessa, eric, david, katie, jacob you all should leave me at least one comment so I know if you're looking at this.  You know, so I know how to best censor myself.  :-)  If needed, that is.  FANTASTIC!  I mean FANTASTICK! Now's the time to go to my beloved Petrof and learn "The Fantasticks" score before we hold the auditions for it in one week.  Good bye.  love Meagan

      Yep, that's the title of my current show -- "Sweet & Hot."  I added the subtitle "Sucks & Sucks" myself.  It is quite sad.  I've never been part of such a low quality musical.  Thank you, Jesus, that I am not the musical director for this one.  I've made it clear to everyone (probably too much) that I am just the accompanist and have made no directorial decisions.  Being musical director so much lately, I've had to work hard to keep my mouth shut.  It's just amazing how the actors are keeping their enthusiasm up; I am quite impressed with them.  Even more reason to keep my mouth shut, so I don't bring everyone down and get a reputation for being...well you know.  Our second performance of "Sweet & Hot" is tonight.  One down, eight to go.  Matt (my bass player) and I are going to go out first and get truffle cups from the BlueStone Cafe!!!  Yay!! Maybe we'll be so delirious with chocolate by the time we arrive at the theatre that we won't care how the show sucks.  Matt's here now.  Gotta go.  love Meagan

      Heellllloooooooo!  Well, it seems like I spend quite a bit of time lately reading other people's blogs online.  I suddenly seem to be quite interested in the mundane details of lives of those I don't really know very well or at all.  So...perhaps someone would be interested in mine!  I honestly can't imagine why.  I promise I'll try to be entertaining :-) but no guarantees.  I might have something exciting to say sometime.  So watch out!  At least I can promise to spell things correctly.  Complete sentences?  Now that's asking too much.  Especially if it's late at night.  I think my blog is starting out ugly.  I will find a way to make it prettier.  My new friend Erin (well, I've known her a few years and now we've hung out once and it was fun, so I guess I can call her "my new friend Erin") has one here that looks way cooler than mine.  Her blog's name is pezpoodle.  Or poodlepez.  I never can remember which.  Maybe she'll read this and set it straight.  And then there's livejournal.com.  Oh my.  An endless variety of fun things to read there.  I keep finding random journals related to all the various musicals I'm working on.  I find the best research really is just talking to people who've already done a particular show, so that's been way helpful.  I think I may become addicted.  I do tend to have an addictive personality.  Speaking of...I just finished my beer.  Grrrrrr.  :-)  Anyway, back to the allure of online fun. (Oh, that sounded bad)  Recently Jacob introduced me to friendster.com.  I'm still not sure what to do with it.  He's the only friend I've added and somehow it suddenly is telling me I have like 300 friends online.  I don't get it.  Connect the Dots (one of the theatre companies I work with often) has a message board on their website, but I think I'm the only one who looks at it regularly.  I really need to get out more.  The first person I need to tell about this blog is my dear friend Katie.  I bet she'd love reading it.  Maybe she already has one of her own.  Katie!!!!???? Are you out there???!!!!   So.  I'll find a theme of some sort for this blog soon.  Or at least some kind of through-line that makes it...um....suspenseful.  Yeah.  That's it!  Suspenseful.  Hmmm, yeah I don't know if that's the word for my life.    love Meagan

      "Little Shop of Horrors" is officially finally over.  It must be.  We had our cast party last night.  Now the show has to end, right?  I loved doing this show.  It was definitely the best band and the most...drama-free...cast.  I know that sounds funny to call a group of actors drama-free.  But if you work in theatre you know what I mean.  There were a few oddballs but no one totally whacko or wanker.  No wankers.  That was nice.  And the BAND ROCKED!  Even when the sound system was acting possessed and the singers couldn't be heard during some songs the band was entertaining enough on its own (don't EVER tell the actors I said that!)!  Anyway.  Good music.  Not difficult music, it's just that we had seven skilled and relaxed musicians that honestly love to play.    Ladies and Gentlemen!  Introducing.... Matt Dorris on guitar!  Jacob Fatooh on bass!  Ruby Reese on winds!  Kevin McKern on drums!  Aaron Blenkush (and David E Weck!) on keyboard!  Meagan Iverson on piano!  Gary Berlant aka wino #2 on harmonica!    There.  I just thought I should introduce us all.  The party was good.  Pretty mellow with much singing and not much wine.  Unusual.  With some parties much wine comes and   then   much singing!  We did all the gay-love songs from "Rent."  Lots of "Into the Woods" and "Godspell" songs and a couple songs shamelessly promoting our upcoming "Les Miserables"!  Tanya sings On My Own so amazingly.  Sadly, none of the guitarists pulled out my guitars.  :-(  Poor guitars.  They only get played when we have parties.  So I know they'll get tuned at least every few months or so.  My student Aaron was our keyboard player for this extra week of Little Shop.  He did an awesome job.  I knew he'd be good, but I wasn't sure how free he'd feel to just really jump in and fit with the band.  But he jammed with them way better than I do.  It was fun, while slightly awkward at times since he is in high school and I am his teacher, having him around.  He even came to the party and stayed for four hours and played for a lot of the songs.  It was nice not being the only accompanist at the party.  I think he has a very different view of his teacher now.  I haven't quite decided yet if that's a good thing or a bad thing.    Katie gave us a little book for people to write or draw in whenever we have parties.  Everytime she comes to visit she reads it to see what she's missed out on.  So sorry, Katie, we forgot to have people write in the book again!  And this would have been a perfect setting to have it just circulating around the house.  Bush is talking about mass graves on TV right now. :-(  It is not fitting with the light-hearted nature of my blog.  Perhaps I will talk about more serious things next week.  love meagan

      I just had a fight with Mike.  A disagreement, let's say.  No.  It was a fight.  Voices were raised.  A door was slammed.  Lightly slammed, nothing rattled.  Just shut harder than necessary.  Does that still count as a slam?  I don't like it when we disagree strongly enough to get mad.  It happens so rarely.  Usually one of us is just like "okay, whatever, it doesn't really matter."  Because usually when we disagree, that's the way it is--it doesn't really matter.  The things that are really important we generally connect well on.  And this thing didn't really matter either.  Well, I guess it sort of came down to money.  Which is, statistically, the number one issue couples fight over.  Which is stupid.  It started out just talking about Connect the Dots and the struggles the company has in the community with discrimination and then ended up being not just a friendly discussion about the homophobic Grants Pass but morphed into being about them not paying me fully.  I guess that bugs him more than I thought.  I hadn't realized.  Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR  I love my husband lots.  More than music and Madeline and Poco and strawberries and chocolate and martinis and Debussy and lipstick and Sondheim and Diet Coke and anything else that is a favorite thing of mine.  love Meagan

      Hi.  Remember me?  It's been a while.  I sort of forgot I had a blog.  Sorry blog.  Sorry faithful blog-readers.  If you exist.  I played piano for three hours yesterday.  Awwwwwww.  So nice and inspiring.  Even if all I was playing was Joplin.  Connect the Dots is doing this big fancy schmancy wild west fundraiser dinner thing so I was practicing for that.  I hope it will be good.  The fundraiser, I mean, not my playing.  I know that will be good.  :-)  Connect the Dots needs some funds raised.  Well I don't have anything exciting, deep, meaningful, or funny to write.  The end.  For now.  love Meagan

      So I had a bit of a quandry amongst myself this evening.  I was invited to this Arbonne Essentials Skin Care Party type thing (think Mary Kay, Tupperware, Avon, etc. that sort of thing, but Arbonne is all natural botanical stuff.).  The reason I was perplexed was because the host of this party is one of my most favorite people and the sales person/consultant is one of my least favorite people.

      I went on a date tonight...with someone other than my husband!!!  It's not as exciting as it sounds.  Well, I mean, not as...scandalous...as it sounds.  I'm just trying to fool you into thinking I do scandalous things. :-)  It was a date with my ten-year-old piano student, Maddie.  I play this little game with some of my students in which they have to reach a certain amount of points--32 to be exact--and when they get to 32 we go out to dinner and to a concert or show or something, no matter how remote, music related.  Usually the way they get points is by answering a trivia question I give them to research for one week.  Not always trivia, but music history, theory, all sorts of things.  It was really fun.  The final question for Maddie, as she neared the 32-point goal was "Why exactly is the goal 32 points? Isn't that a weird number?  There is a musical reason why I chose 32."  Other questions were ones they have to look up if they don't know, but could easily find (they all have a list of fun music websites) like "What is Alberti Bass" or "What was the relationship between Beethoven and Czerny" or "How does the standard blues scale pattern differ from a major scale pattern?"  And some of them were bigger projects like one student created a music resume, another memorized finger four for all scales.  Stuff like that.  Pretty varied.  At first I tried looking online for music trivia-type stuff but didn't find anything very useful so I had to get creative all on my own!  I think I did okay.  I think I'm pleased with myself with this little experiment.  So tonight Maddie and I went to Hometown Buffet (100% her choice!)then to the jazz ensemble concert at SOU.  As always, it was a fantastic concert and it was so fun to be there with her.  She's a very cool kid.  Very interested in all aspects of music.  AND we both in for free, which makes me happy too.  Yes, I want to support the music department, and scholarships, and blah, blah, blah but, whatever.  There are philanthropists to do that.  I'm too poor actually  being  a musician.  I've been feeling more and more lately like I don't know anyone in the music department since I've graduated so when I went to the box office tonight I totally expected to have to buy our two tickets.  The people working the box office I sort of know, not really, just by name and face (Nick and Kate) so I was so pleased, surprised, honored, and all those good things when I whined "Do I really have to pay?" and they gave me two comp tickets!!  Yay!!!  Thank you Nick and Kate!  All Poco does is sit in his water these days.  I'm slightly concerned about him.  He's going to get moldy.  love Meagan

      Here are some lovely quotes for  urlLink Erin  to steal for her blog...if she wants... :-)    "It is possible to play piano without passion - but why?"  "In Bach's 48 I frequently see biological mechanisms and scenes, cells dividing and reproducing, fish swimming and eating one another. What he actually thought two hundred years ago while putting pen to paper neither interests nor concerns me; even if I did know it would probably hinder rather than help."   "Music is quite unlike spoken language in this capacity for metamorphosis of meaning. I wonder if this chameleon property is itself a criterion of goodness in music?"

      Oh, my sadly neglected blog.  It's been over a   week!    Over a week since I've written anything.  That's because Mike is in town.  When he's home I don't get to spend any time at my computer without him around.  It's not that he wouldn't want me to have this silly little blog or anything like that.  And it's not that I'm crazy-distracted when he's home by all the crazy-love (hee hee).  It's just that I know I'd be embarassed by it if he knew.  So I don't write anything when he's around.  And when he's home he's always around.  That's not a bad thing.  I like having him around.  I love him.  I think we have the perfect marriage. I know that sounds conceited.  Oh well, that's the way it is.  I was talking with Jacob about it yesterday; he was asking about Mike and I and how we get on, and I was explaining things to him I was realizing once again that, yep, our relationship is pretty damn healthy.  Except that we really like hitting each other.  Hitting. Slapping.  Pinching.  Biting.  Whatever.  If you know us, you know that that's not as bad as it sounds.  It's all in fun.  I met Eric at Chadwick's tonight.  Yay!  My long-lost-friend Eric.  There was a time when we were really close friends.  Like practically the best of friends, I'd say.  But I guess a lot of that friendship was just based on the amount of time we spent together.  With jazz choir, musicals, piano, etc. there were several months there when we were working together practically every day so that's how we became close.  When he moved away I really think the only reason we stayed friends was because of that duo-piano recital we were working on.  Since that ended (exactly a year ago now) we haven't really had a   reason   to be friends.  I don't like that.  I like to be friends with someone just because it's worth sharing your life with that person.  And he is worth that. But I guess we both have to make the effort.  Tonight was a good time.  Lots to talk about.  Nothing real deep, but not shallow chatter and idle small talk either.  Since he got divorced we are in such different places in life and I worry that will separate us even more than the physical difference of his moving to Chico.  I hope not.  It's not like I can only socialize with married people.  Not at all.  Mike and I have   never   had that kind of relationship.  warning!!!! subject change!!!!  Poco loves baby food!  That's exciting because for the last two years of his life he hasn't eaten anything except pre-packaged "Turtle Food Pellets" and bananas.  And one of the fun things about turtles is that they should be able to healthily eat anything that people eat.  But he refuses to eat any fruits and vegetables besides those bananas.  So I bought some organic baby foods at the Ashland Food Co-op on Sunday.  And he loves it!!!    We had our meet-&-greet for   The Fantasticks   tonight.  It went pretty well.  It's a great cast that I'm really excited about.  Also, I love working with Ed.  It's such a relief from the time spent with Daniel in casting for   Les Miserables  .  They are just two very different men.  With Daniel, life is a struggle and art (theatre) is an escape from that struggle.  With Ed, life is what you do and the art (theatre) is inspired by life.  At least that's the way I feel about the two.  It's very weird working with these two   very   different directors at once.  Even weirder is the fact that Daniel is in the cast of   The Fantasticks  !  Already he and Ed have butted heads over vision, blah, blah, blah.  Oh boy.  I just make music.  That's all I like to do.   Madeline is the noisiest goldfish in the world.  Good night.  love Meagan

      Well, I'm feeling newly inspired to write in my dear blog right now, because Eric actually asked me about my blog tonight.  Told me he'd read it a few weeks ago and there wasn't anything new.  So someone actually reads it!!!   And  I had comments from both Katie and Erin on my last entry!!  Whoa.  My teeth still hurt.  Have you heard of Maslow's Heirarchy of Needs?  I was explaining it to the cast at my rehearsal tonight (yes, I know I'm supposed to be teaching them music, but, well, true to the heirarchy, I had to talk about my hurting teeth.).  It's so hard to focus on anything when you are in pain.  Some people live with constant chronic pain.  I can't imagine it.  Even though I used to have  almost  chronic pain before that hysterectomy.  But that feels like another life.  Now just something as little as dry sockets in my mouth (whatever that is) consumes all my extra brain attention.  I went to the Wild Goose tonight after my rehearsal with Eric and some of his friends that I don't know at all, and actually he doesn't know at all, either.  Hmmm.  That was confusing.  But it was fun.  Yay for karaoke.  Apparently they're regulars there now.  I'd like to be a regular at a karaoke bar.  That'd be fun.  That's the end of my exciting post.  It's 2:18 a.m. and I have rehearsal tomorrow at 9:30.  I guess I'd better sleep.  I miss Katie.  love Meagan

      I know it's time to post a new entry to my blog.  I will soon.  And I  do  have things to say.  Really, I do.  Just not the time to write about it.  Well, I do have time today.  But I'm too busy relaxing right now.  And I have hiccups.  love Meagan

      Well here's something exciting I received in my email today. From Katie.  So I filled it out and sent it back to her.  I don't really know how these silly little questionairres get passed around, but look, here I am continuing the mysterious madness!  Read on, if you just can't go another moment without knowing these facts of my life...  Welcome to the spring 2004 edition of getting to know your friends. What you are supposed to do is copy (not forward) this entire e-mail and paste it onto a new e-mail that you'll send. Change all the answers so that they apply to you, and then send this to a group of your friends (including the person who sent it to you). The theory is that you will learn a lot of little things about your friends, if you don't know them already!  Maybe you'll post me a comment and copy and paste with your answers!  Maybe a random stranger will read my blog and post a comment with their answers.  That'd be weird.  But it could happen.  I sometimes read random strangers' blogs.  Blogs of people I've never heard of.  Not enough to actually get caught up in their life.  That would freak me out.  But it's entertaining at times.  love Meagan   1. What time do you get up? Oh gosh it totally varies.  Between 6 and 9, depending on what I'm doing that day and/or what I did the night before.  3. Any nicknames?  Maggie, Magn   4. If you could eat lunch with one person, who would it be?   Katie!  5. Gold or silver? Silver definitely, Platinum if you want a specific metal!  6. What was the last film you saw at the cinema? Man on Fire  7. What is your favorite TV show? Dharma & Greg  8. What's your favorite book?  It changes all the time, but usually I say "Hinds Feet on High Places" even though I haven't read that book for like ten years.  I remember it was a cool allegory.  I should read it aain.  9. What do you have for breakfast? Sometimes a banana or grapefruit or V8 Splash or McD's plain biscuits.  Today I had a peach but it made my throat do weird things (I really need to stop trying to eat peaches, they always screw up my throat) so then I was really hungry when I got to the church so I ate a ton of goldfish crackers out o f the children's church supplies!  10. Who would you hate to be stuck in a room with? a Hyena.  That would suck.   11. What/Who inspires you? People with passion.    12. Beach, City or Country? City.  Even though I don't actually live in a city.  I'd like to.  13. Favorite ice cream? Umpqua Chocolate Peanut Butter or BaskinRobbins Chocolate Fudge  14. Favorite Color? I like certain shades of green  15. What kind of car do you drive? VW New Beetle  16. Favorite sandwich? Grilled Cheese  17. What characteristics do you despise? Limpness.

If you could go anywhere in the world on a vacation, where would you go? Ireland  20. What is your Favorite brand of clothing? Do you really think I'm stylish enough to have a Favorite brand of clothing?!   21. Where would you like to retire?  Retire!!??  What the hell!!  I'm only 25!!  I don't think about retiring!!  22. Favorite day of the week? with my schedule, every day is pretty different and every day has great potential to be busy or relaxing.  So it's not like I have specifically weekends off to be a favorite.  So I don't know.  My favorite day is a day that I get to spend a lot of time making music and being efficient and not much time doing busy-work.  23. What did you do for last birthday? On my birthday I was at a rehearsal for Grease.  I didn't tell anyone it was my birthday.    24. Where were you born? Portland Oregon.  Yep, I'm a native  25. Favorite sport to watch? Well, if I actually were to watch a sport, I think I would enjoy basketball..  28. What fabric detergent do you use? Fabric Detergent?  Does anyone really care about this?  Well, just so you know, I don't use any fabric detergent because my dear Mike is such a sensitive man that is bothers his skin.  29. Coke or Pepsi? diet coke  30. Favorite Alcoholic Drink: Sapphire Martini up with a twist  31. Are you a morning person or a night owl? It really varies for me.  Once again, totally depends on my current schedule.  I am not, however, an afternoon person.  I would have a siesta every single day if I could.  32. What is your shoe size? 8-1/2  33. Do you have any pets? Madeline--the most mature goldfish in the world and Poco--the baby turtle who is actually a girl even though we've been saying he for the last two years.  34. Favorite restaurant?

Last person you went out to dinner with? Jacob Fatooh at Olive Garden.  I think.  I go out to dinner a lot.  Too much.  36. What would be your ideal birthday cake? Baskin & Robins Chocolate Fudge Ice Cream Cake.  I llllllloooove their combination of ice cream and frosting and cookie chunks!  37. Which store would you choose to max out your credit card? Pottery Barn, maybe.  or some cool furniture store.  Really, a store like Target would also be quite easy to max out.

      Hi.  So I came into my office, turned out the light (because it makes Madeline jump), sat down at my computer, opened Internet Explorer, logged on to magn.blogspot.com, clicked on "create new post", clicked in the title field, and immediately forgot what I came in here to write about.  Grrrrrr!  Where is my memory?!  Maybe it's because I forgot to take my estrogen medicine today.  Yes, I know I'm only 25.  Don't ask.  Hmmmm...  Well, I still don't remember.  I'm sure it was funny.  Hilarious even.  Falling out of your computer chair with laughter funny.  I'm sure of it.   The Fantasticks  opens in one week.  Shit.  I don't know why I said that.  Random profanity.  This show will be good. (I don't know about 45 dollars good, but at least that includes a fantastic dinner {hee hee, notice the play on words} ) We've got a great cast.  They'll get it together.  We've got a great set designer, Susan.  When I first met her over two years ago I couldn't stand being in the same room as her.  Now she is one of my favorite people.  Funny how that works.  Our costumer is weird though.  Just overly... rambunctions.  Rambunctious.  I have no clue how to spell that word. (Mike just came in and scared me.  Yay for both being home!) Originally I thought the vision was for this show to be very artistic, very imaginative, earthy.  Now it's become more cartoony.  Example: The mutes are wearing rainbow suspenders (and, if she gets her way, beanie hats).  Ridiculous.  Oh well.  I just make the music.  And do whatever possible to help them sound good.  Now that  Little Shop of Horrors  is over it's time for a new title for my blog.  I used "The Plant Just said The Strangest Thing" because that was the funniest line from  Little Shop .  Audrey says it right after Seymour saves her from being eaten.  It's funny because (in case you can't figure it out yourself) Audrey doesn't thing it's strange that the plant is talking, just that the thing the plan said is strange.  Yeah.  Funny.  My last blog title was "Watch 'em run amuck" which is a line from  Les Miserables .  Amuck is just a comical word.  Hmmm.  So a new title.  How about "Gin and Tonic", since that's what I'm drinking right now?  Actually I'm drinking cheap-ass gin and walmart-brand club soda.  But who's being particular?  When out I treat myself to Sapphire.  At home it's Monarch or Potter's *!#@)!!#$*#.  I need to get out of theatre and make more money.  Get out of theatre, get out of music, get out of church office-ing.  I'm smart enough, responsible enough, I could have a lucrative career.  I know it.  But I know I'd be miserable.  The artistic side of me (which always prevails) would be squashed.  I cannot abandon music.  I've tried that before.  A couple times.  I guess it's part of me.  I am so unbelievably grateful, lucky, priveleged, indebted, blessed, and any other word my online thesaurus can look up to have such an amazing husband.  Mike knows how I  need  to be a musician and leads me in that direction even when I get down on myself and feel so insufficient compared to all the talented people around me.  See, I told you I could be serious in this blog.  But I'm done now.  love Meagan
