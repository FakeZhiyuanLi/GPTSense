       I got back to school tomorrow. How gay. I can't believe it. This summer has gone by way to fast.   Am I ready for school to start? Umm...I spose. I'm not ready for all the homework, and all that crap though. This year is really going to be difficult, with more classes, and the Ohio Graduation Tests coming up. Erg. I don't have any classes with Kayla or Alana this year, except for lunch, like usual. It sucks, cause I hardly have any friends at Shawnee. Perhaps I can make some new ones...hopefully. I can make friends pretty easily. But yes...I just pray that I can get through this school year ok.      The Purpose Driven Life  is seriously an awesome book. I just got done reading chapter 25, which was titled "Transformed by Trouble"...and wow, it just touched me so much. The whole chapter was pretty much talking about how God has a purpose behind every problem, and every struggle that we face. I'm kind of thinking about doing a lesson on this at prayer sometime. I think it'll be a good lesson topic. I'm gonna post a few quotes and verses that were in this lesson....just to make you all think a little bit. And all of this is true. All the crap that goes on in our lives has purpose...and they will all help us grow closer to God. I have experienced it already. Like when my sister moved out, I feel like I have gotten closer with God, and I feel like I have matured more. God will use every problem we face and do something significant with it.       "You'll never know that God is all you need until God is all you've got."      "Everything that happens to you has spiritual significance."      "What happens outwardly in your life is not as important as what happens inside you."     Romans 8:28-29:  "We know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. For God knew his people in advanced, and he chose them to become like his Son."

       The canoe trip was a blast today. I actually got to canoe this year! Haha. No smashed thumbs this time. Me and Cara rode together. 'Twas a fun time. Except for the time when we ran into the stinkin' thorn tree or whatever it was. We both got scratched up by that thing. It sucked. But yes, with only a few trees in our way, we did a pretty dag on good job canoeing. It only took us about 3 hours to complete this obstacle course they call the Mad River. Wee! I can't wait till next year's trip.      We went back to the church at around 3ish. Then we just sat around for a while, waiting for Jennifer and stuff to get back with the food, which was about 5 when they actually arrived. Those were also good times. This whole day has been pretty awesome. Ah. I freakin' love my youth group. Everyone is so awesome, and we have so much fun together. I love you guys!

       So people have told me that this is easier than Xanga...and I think they are wrong. I've been trying to put links on here and everything, and I guess I'm too stupid to figure it out. If any of you smart computer geniouses out there want to give me a hand sometime on how to work this piece, then please do. I need all the help I can get.

       I decided to make one of these blogs, like all the other cool cats out there. Does this mean goodbye Xanga? Most likely not. I'll still be posting on it. Just not as much I spose. If you ever want to check out my Xanga, just go   urlLink  here   . Woo. Be excited. That's about all I got for now. I give myself a pat on the back for making this. Thanks fellers. Have a nice day.
