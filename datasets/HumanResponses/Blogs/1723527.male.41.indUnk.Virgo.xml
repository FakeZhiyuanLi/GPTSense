       Why marraige is not a sacrament   The Catholic Church is launching a  urlLink global campaign against gay marriage .  On Wednesday President Bush said: "I believe in the sanctity of marriage." Other Republicans such as Sen. Rick Santorum have said that "marraige is a sacrament".  In making such statements, Christian conservatives appear to be saying that marraige should be between a man and a woman. But they are actually saying something far more radical.   A sacrament is  urlLink defined  as a Christian rite or religious symbol. By saying that "marraige is a sacrament", they are saying Christian churches, and only Christian churches, should decide what constitutes a legal marraige. In doing so, they challenge not only so-called "gay marraige", but all marraiges that do not involve a Christian rite or Christian religious symbols.  There are almost a billion secular or non-religious people on this planet. There are more seculars in Europe alone than there are Americans in America. When a secular man and woman decide to spend their lives together, what kind of ceremony do Christian conservatives imagine they choose for their wedding, if should they choose to marry? In most cases a non-religious ceremony. If President Bush and the Vatican are taken at their word, all such marraiges (which must surely number in the millions) would be considered void, because they were not "sacraments".  My wife and I are secular, and when we were married, our wedding made no mention of a supreme being of any kind. Our vows were to each other, not to some imagined holy ghost. That does not change the fact that my wife and I love each other and that we are married legally and in every other sense of the word.  There are also gradations between a purely secular ceremony, and a traditional Christian religious one. Does the mere presence of a religious official make the marraige "sacramental"? If so, then what of gay commitment ceremonies that are performed in a Christian church and in the Christian tradition? We attended such a ceremony several years ago, and it was a very traditional Christian ceremony. Should such ceremonies be called marraige because a church sanctifies it, even though the state (or the Vatican) does not recognize it? Even our wedding, while completely secular but performed by a "religious" humanist celebrant. Who decides which weddings are "sacraments" and which are not? The Pope? Pat Robertson? George Bush? What about other religions?  It is unfortunate that Christian conservatives put their faith above all else, and choose to attack people who form loving committed relationships because that relationship doesn't conform to their expectations. Do they really think the world would be a better place with fewer families, or with more children born to single parents? Would it be better for gay people to lie and pretend to be straight, or for secular people to lie and pretend to be Christian, just so that Christian conservatives don't have to face the reality that not everyone is like them? Do they imagine that God would be pleased if we did that for their sake?  People are who they are, and the sooner we all accept that, the happier we all will be.

       Experts call for retirement of space shuttle   The  urlLink Planetary Society  has released a report from a  urlLink workshop  with astronauts and aerospace experts held last April to propose a new strategy for human exploration in space. One of the key findings:  "Crew and cargo should be transported separately to increase flexibility, reduce cost and reduce risk associated with human space exploration."  In other words, the Space Shuttle's "mini-van" design combining passenger and cargo hauling in the same vehicle is too complex, and should be abandoned in favor of safer, less expensive designs.  I had the opportunity in my youth as an engineering student in Houston to meet one of the giants of the space business, spacecraft designer Max Faget. Faget was an advocate of a smaller and simpler design for the shuttle with a small cargo capacity. Last May, Faget said that it was time to  urlLink retire the shuttle  and start working on a new launch vehicle.  The Planetary Society's report expresses much the same idea:  "We see no essential role for continuing flight of the shuttle orbiter beyond its immediate goal of completing construction of the International Space Station and early transport of crewmembers to and from the Station. As soon as an alternate mode of human transport into and from low Earth orbit (LEO) is available, which should be accomplished as soon as possible, the shuttle orbiter should be retired."

       Tech jobs to move overseas  By the end of 2004, 1 in 10 technology jobs could be moved overseas to markets like India to cut costs. Details  urlLink here .  Many of these jobs will be in software development, which remains labor-intensive and thus driven by labor costs. The emergence of skilled software engineers in countries like India and China, the tough IT market, monetary exchange rates, and new restrictions making it harder to bring skilled people into the United States, probably make such a shift inevitable.  The challenge for those of us working in the information sector in America is to respond in a positive way. Obviously if your own job is cut, its hard to be positive about it. But until that happens, there are some things you can do. Focus on your own development to keep your job skills current, and not just technical skills. There will be a need for people here to manage relationships with overseas technology vendors. Any experience working on virtual teams is a plus.  If you work for a large company, or in a community with lots of high tech employers, look for opportunities to move to a job that is doing something really innovative, something that isn't turnkey, something that isn't mature and can't easily be outsourced or moved offshore in a few years. And if what was innovative yesterday becomes mature today, move again.

       Afghans living in fear  The BBC reports that Afghans are living in a  urlLink climate of fear .   In its rush to overthrow the Taliban two years ago with a minimal commitment of American ground troops, the US threw its support behind Afghan warlords whose commitment to democracy and freedom were questionable. Now Afghan women and others trying to exercise their freedoms are being subjected to threats and intimidation, and many are afraid to leave their homes. If the situation does not improve, Afghanistan's hopes for democracy may be stillborn.  This is appalling considering the commitments that were made by the US and other countries not to abandon Afghanistan a second time. As with Iraq, it is too early to say if those commitments will be met or not.

       Bush protecting Saudis   Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama has criticized the Bush Administration for classifying sections of the 9/11 report to avoid embarrassing the Saudi government. Details  urlLink here .  Is it just me, or is there a contradiction here? Since when does the Bush Administration have qualms about embarrassing or even humiliating foreign governments? Remember how they bullied governments all over the world, first to try to get their vote in favor of an Iraq resolution on the UN Security Council, then to provide support for the Iraq war. Governments were threatened with the loss of foreign aid if they didn't cooperate, or offered bundles of cash if they did. Those who didn't cooperate were snubbed.  Seriously, would the Bush administration lift a finger to avoid embarassing the French, a democratic country with which we have had over two hundred years of close relations? Then what makes the Saudis deserve such special treatment? It surely isn't their form of government, an Islamic police state that treats women only marginally better than the Taliban did.  You know the answer. It's sitting in your garage.

       Why I Support Howard Dean for President   I’ve always had a love hate relationship with politics and politicians. My core political beliefs have always centered around inclusion and justice, with a strong respect for democracy and civil liberties, and an equally strong distrust of authority. I have always felt that political candidates and causes need to earn my support. I don’t support politicians unless they talk straight and stand up for values I agree with.  One candidate for the 2004 Presidential election has earned my support. His name is Howard Dean. He is a medical doctor and former governor of Vermont. Dean is the only candidate who stands up for values I believe in, and perhaps the only candidate who can beat George Bush.  Since the September 11th attacks, the Bush Administration has taken our country in some frightening directions. Bush has squandered an enormous outpouring of sympathy from the world after the attacks bypursuing a policy of pre-emptive war and reckless disregard for international law. Bush has gutted environmental and social legislation designed to protect the future. He has passed tax cuts and other special interest laws to benefit his corporate donors. His Attorney General and his Patriot Act have gutted precious liberties with secret trials and imprisonment. He has alienated long time allies and made America feared and distrusted in much of the world, resulting in citizen boycotts of American products. Bush has divided Americans at home by encouraging jingoistic patriotism and bigotry with an aggressive and excessively religious and nationalistic tone.  This isn’t the kind of America I want to live in. Howard Dean is the only candidate for president saying that Bush is taking the country in the wrong direction. Dean wants civil rights for all Americans. He was the governor who had the guts to sign the Vermont civil union law giving gay couples many of the same rights that most Americans take for granted. He is pro choice. He has a health care plan that extends health care coverage to all Americans who want it while keeping the current system. He is a fiscal conservative who has balanced budgets. He has an “A” rating from the NRA. He opposed the war in Iraq not because he is against all war, but because the case was never made that Iraq was a threat. It now looks like he was right.  More importantly, he has delivered real results in his own state for our most precious citizens: children. Dean helped to create programs where every child and new mother in the state of Vermont is offered a visit from a family counselor to discuss their needs. Child abuse in the state is down 43% and child sexual abuse is down 70% in eight years. Virtually every child in Vermont also has health care. Similar programs on a national level could do much to curb crime and violence in the future.  Howard Dean has a vision for a different kind of America than where Bush is taking us. A vision where America is respected in the world, not merely feared. An America that works with our allies rather than going it alone. An America where Americans take care of each other, where it is not enough that our family has good food, good jobs, or good schools, but where every American has access to the same things. An America where all Americans are equal in the eyes of the law. An America where right wing talk show hosts and fundamentalist preachers don’t define morality for the rest of us.  These are some of the reasons I support Howard Dean. The fact that he is a Democrat is not one of the reasons, however. As an independent, I don’t believe that political party is a good enough reason to support anyone. In the past, I have supported candidates on the basis of party affiliation or political philosophy alone. No more. What matters to me is the candidate, what their values are, and what they are going to do when elected. And most importantly their credibility. Do they talk straight? Do they have principles? Do they stand up for what they believe in? Do they care about this country? Have they made a difference? Dean has.  I have to admit that since September 11, I have at times been ashamed to be an American. Our country has become a bully, threatening and occupying other nations, and killing thousands of civilians in foreign wars in the past two years. The conservative majority has suppressed dissent and labeled Americans opposed to the war as enemies of the state. The American flag has come to represent a new kind of Imperial Rome. I have wondered if it is safe to travel abroad, not because of terrorism, but because of resentment and anger that has been generated towards Americans by Bush’s policies of aggression and arrogance.  Howard Dean has said it loud and clear. America is not an empire, it is not Rome. It is a place of freedom, where all people are equal before the law. Howard Dean makes me proud to be an American again. Howard Dean gives me hope that America can become a great country once again, not justed a feared country. He has given me hope that someday I can travel abroad and have someone smile at me, and say thank you, because I am American.

      The last 24 hours have been truly magical.   Last night our family went to the Boise Astronomical Society's star party at Black's Creek Rifle Range east of Boise. I brought my small 50mm Polaris Meade telescope and pointed it at Mars. The turnout was huge. The available parking was overwhelmed with cars. Suddenly people lined up by the dozens to see the Red Planet through my telescope. Even though Mars was low on the horizon, and my telescope is far too small to see any surface detail, it was clear that many people had never gotten a better view of Mars in their lives. Many expressed their feelings with "Wow" or "Cool", or simply "Thank you". Some asked questions, and it was quite wonderful to be able to share my knowledge of the stars with others.  This morning we got up early to drive to the Boise airport see Howard Dean on his campaign tour on the way to Portland and Seattle. A crowd of over 400 people turned out. I saw a number of friends and made new friends in the crowd. It was truly inspiring. Dean is just as powerful a speaker in person as he is online or on television.   Dean promised to campaign in Idaho during the general election, and to help grow the Democratic party in Idaho. Dean said that the way to make this happen is for Democratic candidates to say what they think and stand up proudly for what they believe in.  Even though I am independent I think a strengthened Democratic party in Idaho would be a good thing. Idaho is so Republican that politicians no longer really bother to campaign. It would be better if candidates of both parties had to actively campaign and address issues of the day to win the support of swing voters.   Dean also said that we need to do a better job of supporting the troops in Iraq. Those of us who are against the war shouldn't be angry at the troops, we should be angry at the Bush administration for sending them there and not getting them enough international support to share the burden of policing Iraq. As for the Bush administration increasing their stay and cutting their pay, Dean said "I think that stinks".  Near the end of his speech, Dean picked up an American flag, and speaking of the fact that John Ashcroft is coming to Boise Monday to promote the Patriot Act, said that the flag doesn't belong to the right wing of the Republican Party, it belongs to all Americans.   I decided to go out and buy an American flag for the first time. I will put it up on my home this week. As soon as I can, I will get a United Nations flag to go alongside it, in honor of the UN workers who were murdered in Iraq while trying to help the Iraqi people.

       Why Libertarians should support Howard Dean for president in 2004  In the 1990s, for almost ten years I was an active member of the Libertarian Party. I attended two national conventions, served as a state party membership director, and a state party chairman. While my views have changed, and I no longer consider myself a libertarian, I still agree with libertarians on many issues and still have friends in libertarian circles.   I don't believe that voting for a third party candidate is always a wasted vote. A vote for a third party candidate can be effective when a) both major party candidates are uninspiring or fail to address important issues; b) both major party candidates would pursue similar policies if elected, and c) the third party candidate is likely to draw away enough support to exceed the margin of difference between the major candidates. In these conditions, a third party candidate can force one of the major party candidates to move their position closer or risk losing the election. In this scenario, a vote for a third party candidate has leverage. It is low risk and high payoff. If the third party candidate most closely represents your views, it is well spent.  These conditions existed in the 2000 presidential election. Democrat Al Gore, once considered a liberal because of his strong environmental views, ran to the center, saying next to nothing about environmental issues during the campaign. Republican George W. Bush, the darling of the religious right, also tried to run as a moderate. A third party candidate emerged and drew off enough support from one of the candidates in swing states like Florida and New Hampshire to throw the election the other way.  But that candidate was not Libertarian Harry Browne. While Browne actually exceeded the margin between Bush and Gore in Florida, Ralph Nader got six times as many votes in Florida as Browne. Nationally, Browne got 0.36% of the vote, and Nader 2.74% of the vote, eight times as much as Browne. See the 2000 election results  urlLink here .   The impact of Browne on the 2000 election was negligible. Nader, on the other hand, is widely believed to have lost the election for Gore. More accurately, Gore lost it for himself because he did not pay more attention to Nader supporters and their concerns.  Of course, it turned out that Bush was not a moderate, but an extremist who has attacked civil liberties, invaded Iraq despite overwhelming world opposition, subsidized corporate America, exploded the national debt, and lost three million jobs. The leading Democratic contender for the 2004 presidential election, Howard Dean, is the opposite of Bush on all these issues. Dean is energizing liberals and independents in much the same way we can expect Bush to energize conservatives, especially religious fundamentalists and nationalists.  So the 2004 presidential election is very different from 2000. It seems to leave little ground on the left or right for a third party candidate to emerge. Even if Nader runs again, it is unlikely that he will be able to draw away as many voters from Dean as he did from Gore. Liberals seem to have decided that getting Bush out of power in the 2004 election is what matters most, and Dean is popular among liberals.  And what about the candidates seeking the Libertarian presidential nomination? So far, none seem likely to break out of the 1/2 of 1% or less that Libertarian presidential candidates have earned in the past.  So who should libertarians vote for in 2004? It all depends on what they want to accomplish. If they just want to perpetuate the Libertarian Party as an organization, or if they want a candidate who will deliver a pure libertarian message without having any other impact, they should vote Libertarian. But if they want to make the country more free than it is today, they should support Howard Dean.  Bush may appear to be a better choice for libertarians because of his tax cuts. However, there are many issues where Dean takes positions that are closer to libertarian positions than Bush, or at least no further.  * Equal rights. Dean is pro-choice. Bush isn't. Dean signed the civil unions bill in Vermont that ended discrimination against gay and lesbian couples with regards to visitation rights and similar partnership issues. Bush is opposed to civil unions, and supports anti-sodomy laws such as those recently overturned by the Supreme Court.   * Civil liberties: Bush supports the Patriot Act, which gives the government sweeping authority to arrest and search people on the mere suspicion of terrorism. Dean opposes the Patriot Act. Bush has introduced the idea of "enemy combatants" and allowed prisoners captured overseas to be held indefinitely without trial or even the rights of prisoners of war. Bush has also introduced "military tribunals" in which prisoners could be tried in secret without due process.  * Foreign policy. Bush has created a doctrine of pre-emption which claims that America has the right to attack other nations who are no threat to us but might become a threat in the future. Bush would have us in a state of perpetual war against the world. Dean believes in going to war only if the president can make a convincing case to the American people that there is a real threat against the United States. When America must use force, it should gain the support of the world and allies rather than going it alone, or using threats and intimidation of other countries to gain their support. Dean would have America be a moral leader not just a military leader.  * Separation of church and state. Libertarians advocate a strict separation of church and state. Bush uses religious language in all his speeches and has pushed divisive legislation to provide federal funding of religious charities that discriminate on the basis of religion or sexual orientation. Dean does not use religious language, and opposes Bush's faith-based initiatives.  * Gun rights. Dean opposes additional gun laws at the federal level, and has never voted for gun control legislation. For this reason he has earned an "A" rating from the NRA. He does believe that states have the right to have tougher gun laws if they wish. Dean opposes legislation giving gun manufacturers special protection from lawsuits.   * Economic growth. Most libertarians want to reduce both taxes and spending. Bush cuts taxes, but he is also a believer in deficit spending. Government has continued to grow under the Bush administration, along with the national debt. Three million jobs have been lost since Bush took office, and nothing has been done to curb corporate fraud or restore investor confidence. Dean is a fiscal conservative who balanced budgets every year as governor of Vermont, and often drew the ire of liberals who wanted to expand social programs beyond the current tax base. Dean wants to balance the federal budget.  Obviously there are many issues where libertarians wouldn't agree with Dean. Libertarians basically believe in an individualist, every man for himself approach. Dean believes in community, that we are all in this together. Dean talks about restoring high moral purpose to government, language that might make libertarians wary. Dean wants to strengthen international institutions such as the United Nations, libertarians oppose them because of the belief that they could subvert individual rights that our constitution protects.  In reality, the U.S. government under George W. Bush is subverting individual rights at home and abroad. Institutions such as the International Criminal Court may ultimately defend us from our own government. But the best way to preserve our freedom may be to replace the administration that is undermining them, with one that will defend our liberties. Howard Dean has the best chance of doing just that.

       No hazard pay for US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan  It seems that the Defense Department wants to renege on a hazard pay increase promised to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in April. It seems that the Bush Administration is deferring to the Pentagon and supports the rollback. Details  urlLink here .  It is an outrage for the President to say he supports the troops while extending their stay in the battle zone and reneging on hazard pay promised months ago.  Americans are dying every day in Iraq. If the risk of getting shot or dying of heat stroke isn't a hazard, I don't know what is.  This also makes me wonder, what, if anything, it means to say "I support our troops". Does it mean simply agreeing that they should be deployed into a particular battle zone, or does it mean that the troops get the food, equipment, and logistical support they need to be successful, and decent compensation for their service to the country.   Bush has done a lousy job of supporting the troops in any sense except being a cheerleader for their presence in foreign lands. If you really support the troops, in the broadest possible sense, you cannot support this president.

       Making history   The first week in August appears to have been a relatively slow news week, apart from the recall circus in California. One of the most important stories were a pair of decisions coming out of the general convention of the Episcopal church.  The church made history earlier this week by its appointment of openly homosexual Gene Robinson as bishop of New Hampshire. A decision that has gotten less attention but which may ultimately prove be more important for civil rights is the decision by the church to  urlLink recognize same sex unions .   These decisions are important because they continue to chip away at fundamentalist religious justifications for discrimination against gays and lesbians. In the past it could be argued that homosexuality was a crime in many states, but the Supreme Court's sodomy decision has undermined that argument. In the past it could be argued that no mainstream Christian church would recognize gay and lesbian individuals as decent people, as being equal to straight people in the eyes of God, but the appointment of a gay bishop says otherwise. In the past it could be argued that no mainstream Christian church would recognize same sex unions. No longer the case.  Religious fundamentalists are increasingly being put in a position where they are forced to admit the truth about their biases, or change their position. The existence of Christian churches and governments that accept gays and lesbians means that being Christian does not require one to condemn homosexuals or discriminate against them. It is no longer a requirement of faith. If the Bible is open to interpretation, then which interpretation one chooses is just that, a personal choice.  For that reason, it will eventually no longer be acceptable to say "I disapprove of homosexuality, that's just my belief" as a basis for discrimination, any more than it is acceptable now to condemn interracial or interfaith relationships.  For an excellent analysis, see this  urlLink article by Deborah Mathis .

      We're back from the Oregon coast. We had an awesome family vacation, staying in Portland, Seaside, and Newport.   This was the first time our daughters had seen the ocean, and they loved it. We spent time together beach combing, building sand castles, and chasing waves. We visited two aquariums, two lighthouses, and took a marine sea life cruise. We saw sea lions, harbor seals, nesting sea birds by the thousands, and even a pair of California gray whales in the wild. And of course, lots of shopping. I also got to eat some great seafood, fresh from the boats.  We also enjoyed our stay in Portland where we visited the Oregon Zoo, the OMSI, and Powell's Books, one of the largest bookstores in America. We rode the Max, Portland's light rail system, and the Portland Streetcar. Every city should be so lucky to have such excellent public transportation.  I hope to get photos from the trip online soon.

       Why favorites are not one of my favorite things  If you're like most people, you visit a lot of web sites. Chances are you've found some places you would like to visit again and saved them in your Favorites. That's where your problems begin.  Favorites are an important feature of internet browsers, but unfortunately they are based on an old concept in software design, which I call opaque hierarchical structures, which makes them not only quite obsolete but ultimately quite useless.  Favorites, like menus and directory-based file systems, use a hierarchy or series of levels where only one level is visible at a time. With files, you can see the folder "My Pictures" but you can't see what's in that folder unless you open it, and if you do you can't see the level above or any folders at the same level. Similarly with menus, you can see the entire menu bar, but to see what's on the Tools menu, you have to select it, and then you can't see what's on the Edit menu or any other menu at the same time.  Hierarchical structures were an improvement over simple lists because they break up the number of files (or menu items or favorites) into shorter lists that are easier to scan for the item you want. But there is a cost. Users can only see a small subset of the available selections at any given time. Everything else is hidden. This forces users to remember the hierarchy and where to find things, or to grope around in the hierarchy in search of the thing they want. For a small hierarchy this is fine, but once the number of files (or menu items or favorites) gets above a hundred or so, the opaqueness becomes an annoyance, and eventually, a nightmare.  Features such as expandable folders in Windows Explorer, by the way, don't really solve this problem, they just convert the heirarchy to a simple list, which is the structure the hierarchy was designed to improve on the first place.  In the case of personal files or favorites, users are also forced to come up with a set of folder and subfolder names that they can remember, and put things in the right place religiously, otherwise they won't be able to find them later. The fact that favorites don't put your files in the "right place" for you automatically means you will ultimately have to search for them. In the case of files you may have a search engine, but in the case of favorites or menu commands you have no choice but to grope around.  To understand how frustrating this can be, imagine a house with a lot of doors each leading to a single room, and inside each room are doors each leading to an even smaller room, etc., and you have to find your car keys. That is what navigating heirarchies can be like.  A search engine for favorites would help, but if you are going to use a search engine to find things, who needs the hierarchical structure in the first place. Better to have everything out in the open where you can see it. Less like an insane house of mirrors, more like a map.  One wonders why a user should have to mark favorites anyway. Shouldn't the computer just remember every web site I've been to? Disk space is cheap. Shouldn't it clean up the list automatically and remove stale links? Of course it should. Shouldn't I be able to search that list the same way I can search a file system? Of course you should. But you can already search the web almost as quickly, again making favorites appear unnecessary.  One answer may be to use some restraint. Limit your favorites to your absolute favorite web sites, the ones you visit all the time. But then if you visit them all the time, you probably won't need favorites to remember them anyway.

       Europe launches moon probe  The European Space Agency has successfully launched  urlLink Smart 1 , the first European mission to the moon.  While this is not Europe's first mission beyond Earth orbit, the Smart 1 mission is significant because it uses ion drive, an advanced propulsion system much more efficient than chemical rockets. Only a few spacecraft have used ion propulsion though it has been known since the 1960s.  With NASA grounded, and China soon to launch its first manned space flight, space is no longer exclusively a US-Russian domain. This is good, because it means that progress in space will continue even if one of the major programs is set back. The convergence of US, Japanese, and European spacecraft on Mars next year may be a sign of things to come in space.

       Microsoft contradicts itself  In the September issue of MacAddict, it was reported that Microsoft will  urlLink no longer develop  its Internet Explorer web browser for the Macintosh.  The reasons Microsoft gives for this move are interesting. Microsoft claims that Apple's web browser, Safari, has an advantage because Apple develops the Mac operating system. Microsoft say's it can't compete against Safari because Apple can use hidden source code that Microsoft doesn't have access to.  While this is true enough, it is also exactly the opposite of what Microsoft said a few years ago in the Netscape lawsuit. Back then, Microsoft denied that its Internet Explorer web browser gave it an unfair advantage over Netscape because it used hidden hooks in the Windows operating system that Netscape didn't have access to. Gotcha!  Most likely, Microsoft has decided that since it has conquered the Windows browser market, the Mac market was no longer worth the effort. Look for Microsoft to make IE less and less compatible with the HTML standard so that Safari, Netscape, and Opera will not work well with web sites optimized for IE. Once again users will be forced to buy Microsoft products whether they like it or not.

       On principle and hypocrisy  In the last week or so, Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean's opponents, as well as the news media have been trying to make an issue of the fact that Dean has changed his positions on some issues or spoken in a way that gives that impression.  I believe that in many cases this is an artifact of the way Howard Dean communicates. He is brief and to the point, and only adds detail when pressed to do so. For example, in the Democractic presidential debate in Albequerque last week, Dean said we needed to internationalize the war in Iraq, bring in more foreign troops, and "bring the troops home". In a later interview he clarified that what he meant was not bringing all the American troops home, but cutting the American troops by half while increasing the overall force with even more foreign troops. Opponents will call this a change in position, but it really is just communication style.  Meanwhile his opponents in Congress and the Senate have been doing complete turnabouts on issues such as the war, tax cuts, and other issues where they voted to support Bush only a year ago. Democrats who voted for the war then and are critical of Bush's handling of the war now have explained their votes with excuses like "that was a very emotional time". It is in such times when leadership and standing on principle are needed most.  It's pathetic that the media is going back 8 years to find issues where Dean's positions are now different, while giving Kerry and Lieberman and Gephardt a free ride on their reversal on the Iraq war and tax cuts. The fact that they supported Bush on these issues damages the credibility of their entire campaigns, and the media should call them on it.

       The Golden Week  Two years after the Sept 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, I reflect on the meaning of that event and how it has changed my life.  One of the most remarkable things about the attacks was the week that followed. I call it the Golden Week. For a week, Americans, normally too obsessed with making money and living their hurried lives to pay attention to other people around them, rediscovered courtesy and neighborhood. People said hello to perfect strangers they would see in the supermarket. They would drive a little less aggressively. They realized, if only briefly, that the people in their lives were more important than anything else, and that those people could be taken away at any time. It was a week of deep reflection that could have resulted in a different kind of America, one where having it all was less important than enjoying what you have.  But the Golden Week passed. People went to church, and were told that God was in control. People turned on the news, and were told by government officials and media pundits that there was nothing wrong with the American way of life, that our enemies were evil, and that the only thing that had to change was that our enemies had to be destroyed. It quickly became clear that the root causes of terrorism would go unaddressed, that no public debate would occur, and that America would not change, except to become what many had feared, a superpower perpetually at war with the rest of the world.  The outpouring of shock, grief, and goodwill from around the world was squandered in a matter of weeks. With the first bomb that killed an innocent in Afghanistan, our country became not just a victim, but a victimizer. America became blind to any deaths but our own. The three thousand innocents killed in Afghanistan were not only forgotten, to most Americans they never existed and still don't to this day.  Also forgotten were other things. Like the fact that a plane filled with University of Washington students also crashed on Sept 11, 2001, shattering the lives of many families. Or the fact that before the terrorist attack, Rudy Guiliani was in political trouble, the NY police and fire departments were both in the midst of scandals involving alleged racism. While it was admirable to finally recognize the sacrifices that police and fire personnel make every day, and to hold them up as heroes, it was not just the NY police and fire personnel who deserved this. Many police and fire fighters were killed on the same day in the normal line of duty. So too did many Americans die on the same day for many other reasons. They have been forgotten.  Soo too were our freedoms forgotten, in the hasty passage of the Patriot Act following the tragedies. In a rush to judgement, we threw away our freedoms more quickly and with more recklessness than any terrorist could take them from us.  Two years later, Americans are starting to remember. They are remembering that our freedom is more important than fear. They are remembering that what made America admired around the world was not our military might, but our moral leadership. They are remembering that the flag belongs not just to right-wing ideologues, but to all Americans. They are remembering that social and economic justice are not alien to the American experience, but part of it. And maybe, just maybe, they are remembering that Golden Week and wanting to bring it back.

       Rumsfeld memo casts doubts on terror war  A Defense Department  urlLink memo  by Donald Rumsfeld paints a grim outlook for the Bush Administration's War on Terror. In the memo, Rumsfeld wonders if Muslim religious schools may be training future terrorists faster than the United States military can kill them. "Is our current situation such that 'the harder we work, the behinder we get'? " he asks. "The cost-benefit ratio is against us! Our cost is billions against the terrorists' cost of millions", he says.  Well, duh. Some of us have been trying to say that for years. You can't beat fanatics who can kill thousands and do billions of dollars in damage by carrying a box cutter onto an airplane, by bombing a village from 10,000 feet with a billion dollar stealth bomber originally designed to defeat Soviet radar. Using million dollar cruise missiles to blow up straw houses in a remote desert village where a terrorist maybe stayed six months ago (and killing innocent women and children in the process) isn't cost-effective either.   This war is bankrupting our national treasury and making us less safe in the process. Not only are our military actions angering people in the Islamic world, driving more people to extremism, the money we spend on oil goes directly to fund oppressive regimes that suppress dissent, and to fund the very religious schools Rumsfeld acknowledges are breeding terrorists.  Rumsfeld's solution is to set up a private foundation to encourage Islamic schools to adopt a "more moderate course". That'll go over well with the Christian right, let's send our money to Islamic schools in Saudi Arabia, I can see them getting out their checkbooks now. Don't even think about how that would play in the Arab press.  Sending money to Islamic schools, even moderate ones, is not the answer either. The answer is to adopt a balanced policy toward the Palestinian conflict that leads to peace, and a renewable energy policy at home so fewer of our dollars are going to prop up emirs and sheikhs and other tyrants in the Arab world who oppress and frustrate their own people to the point where radicalism is the only outlet.

       Why  urlLink Yang Liwei  should have been front page news  When the Soviets launched Sputnik into orbit in 1957, Americans were awed and alarmed. How can backward Russian Communists beat Americans into outer space? When they launched Yuri Gagarin in 1961, the first human to orbit the Earth, the alarm was ignited again. Events like this accelerated the U.S. space program to such a degree that America surpassed the Russians and landed on the moon first, in 1969, only 12 years after Sputnik.  Though they have largely been forgotten now, Sputnik and Gagarin were household words in America in their time. They were front page news. But what about  urlLink Yang Liwei , China's first astronaut? What kind of coverage for him? In Idaho, and throughout much of America, buried in the back pages.  There are at least two reasons I can think of for this. China is not the aggressive rival that the Soviet Union was. China matched America's achievements 40 years later, not ahead of us.  The American media may assume that because the Chinese are 40 years late in orbiting an astronaut, they are 40 years behind. Not necessarily. Space programs are not just a function of technology, they are also a function of economics and political will. Many space enthuasts predicted that humans would follow the Apollo missions with large orbiting space stations and human missions to Mars. One book I remember reading in the mid-1970s predicted that humans would reach Mars by 1986!  The people who made such predictions looked at a purely technical timetable carried forward from Apollo. Given the economic and political will, humans to Mars could have been done and could be done now within ten years of any decision to do so. While technical setbacks can occur, it is economics and politics that create most of the fits and starts in space programs, not technology.  All the indicators are that China is emerging as an economic power and is determined to carry forward with their space program. If this continues, the Chinese could have their own space station in less than a decade, and otherwise be on par with American space capabilities if not with our list of "firsts". While Americans don't need to be alarmed as we once were over Sputnik, we should not be complacent either. We should both welcome the Chinese as potential future space partners, and be motivated to redouble our own efforts in space. The alternative is to continue to believe in our innnate, god-given supremacy in space while the fact of that supremacy slips away.

       Why myths spread faster than facts  The Seattle Post-Intelligencer reports that an alarming number of cancer patients believe a  urlLink myth  that cancer will spread more quickly when exposed to air during surgery. An alarming 19 percent of patients said they would refuse cancer surgery on the basis of the belief even if their doctors told them it had no scientific basis. Most patients could not say when they first heard this idea.  This is an example of what scientists call a "meme", a self-replicating bit of culture that survives by spreading from mind to mind. In this case, a myth is circulating in the cancer patient community. The appeal of the myth is understandable given the stress that cancer patients face, and the insidiousness of the disease. What is surprising to me is not that this type of meme spreads, but why perfectly valid memes that promote human health don't seem to have anywhere near the same traction.  The act of washing hands after going to the bathroom, for example, is the single most simple and effective measure to curb the spread of disease. A mere 15 seconds of hand washing is plenty to kill most germs. Yet many adult men in particular fail to do so, especially in public restrooms where they are most likely to spread or catch disease. They apparently believe an alternate meme, that "germs happen to other people."  It would be interesting to know why some memes that are obviously nonsense spread and others that are obviously useful don't. Clearly the usefulness of the meme in what we like to call "the real world" isn't that important to the meme's survival. The only thing that seems to matter is whether the meme has a characteristic that causes it to spread. Whether the belief in the meme is deadly to the host long term doesn't matter to the meme, only that the host survives long enough to spread the meme to another mind. What characteristics have this property is not yet known.  With such knowledge, one could perhaps spread a meme suggesting that space aliens frequent male bathrooms for the express purpose of infecting men with nanorobots that steal their potency, sort of an anti-Viagra. THAT might get men to wash their hands more. But such knowledge could also be used for darker purposes, to manipulate public opinion  for example. Not that advertisers and politicians aren't already trying to do that to us. They are. But we can take some comfort that theirs is an inexact science. Precise knowledge on how to infect human minds with selected beliefs would be dangerous indeed. I would rather take my chances with the germs.

       Kerry and Gephardt speak Washingtonese on budgets   In yesterday's MSNBC debate in Iowa, Sen. John Kerry and Rep. Dick Gephardt repeatedly went after Dean on Medicare and budget cuts. Kerry repeatedly asked Howard Dean if he would "slow the rate of growth of Medicare" as if this were a cardinal sin. Gephardt repeatedly charged Dean with cutting social services in Vermont, when Dean says he has done no such thing. Whence cometh this madness?  It comes from Washington. Once politicians serve in Washington long enough, they come to see the growth of government programs as inevitable, even normal, and view any effort to "slow the rate of growth" of government as the same as cutting that program. The problem with this kind of Washington thinking is that most people don't think this way.   If your employer raises your salary 3 percent when you had hoped for a 5 percent raise, you might be disappointed, even angry, but you are not going to call this a 2 percent cut in your salary. Most Americans know how to do math properly, that if you are making more money after a salary change than before it, that change is an increase, not a cut.  In the case of government programs, the rate at which a program should grow over time is not set in stone, it is a matter of opinion and debate. The only standards one can measure against objectively are what was spent on the program last year, and what the spending would have to be to adjust for inflation. Beyond that, any statement about what the growth rate of Medicare should be is just an opinion.  Kerry's opinion seems to be that Medicare should be allowed to grow out of control indefinitely, and that it would be insensitive to seniors to limit its growth.  Some conservatives have the opposite opinion, that government programs should not grow at all. Several months ago Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, wrote an editorial saying that "Howard Dean is no fiscal conservative" because he allowed the state budget to grow while he was governor.  It may be appropriate for some programs to grow faster than the rate of inflation. But programs can't grow out of control indefinitely because we live in a finite world with finite resources. Sooner or later every society has to tackle the question "what percentage of our economy SHOULD we spend on health care?", or any other social service function. Once a program reaches that size, it isn't going to able to grow faster than the economy itself in the long run.  Limiting the rate of growth of government programs isn't cutting, it's sound fiscal management. That's exactly what Howard Dean has done as governor of Vermont. Kerry and Gephardt simply don't get it, and aren't going to.

       Political cartoonist endorses Dean  Cartoonist Ted Rall has written an article explaining  urlLink why he supports Howard Dean for President , why Dean may be the only person who can defeat George Bush, and why defeating Bush is more important than anything else this year.  Should Dean win the nomination, I will be surprised if he doesn't pick up support from many of the people who have supported Greens or Libertarians in the last election. For the first time in years we have a clear choice between the major party candidates for president. I can't imagine that many of those folks will vote for Bush, or for an irrelevant third party presidential candidate.

       Brit leadership up in arms over Bush steel tariffs   A  urlLink story  in the UK newspaper Guardian discusses how European leaders are angry at George Bush's signing a tariff on foreign steel. The WTO has recently ruled that this tariff is illegal, and European leaders are threatening to sanction American products made in key swing states such as Florida in an effort to undermine Bush's re-election chances.  A plot of the notorious Bush-hating French? Maybe, but the issue has also angered the British, to the point where members of the Blair administration are saying they will support the sanctions and even support Democrats if Bush doesn't back down.  I don't like the idea of foreign leaders trying to influence American elections, but we shouldn't be surprised, especially in the case of the Brits. After all, Blair and his people put their own re-election at risk when they supported Bush in a war that was hugely unpopular in Britain, and the tariffs were seen as a slap in the face. Bush's action is causing job losses in Europe, who can blame Europe for wanting to strike back at Bush?   If Bush doesn't back down, we can add the WTO to the list of international bodies Bush has trashed. It is a shame that US workers who may not even have voted for Bush will get caught in the crossfire of this trade war, if it happens.

       Of Confederate flags and pickup trucks  Howard Dean has gotten into trouble because of a comment he has used in his stump speech about wanting to "be the candidate of guys with Confederate flags on their pickup trucks". Dean has apologized for the remarks, and pointed out what he meant was what he has said on a number of occasions, that the Democratic Party needs to reach out to white southern voters by pointing out to them that their lives have actually become worse off under Republicans.  Smelling blood in the water, candidates John Edwards and Al Sharpton jumped on Dean. Sharpton charged that Dean was anti-black and that the statement amounted to an endorsement of the confederate flag. When Dean tried to respond to Sharpton saying that those white southerners should put down the confederate flag and support Democrats, Edwards, who mentions at every opportunity that he is the son of a Carolina mill worker, said that southerners don't need northerners like Dean "coming down here" and telling them what to do.  The tag team of Edwards and Sharpton are trying to have it both ways. If the confederate flag is a symbol of racism, as Sharpton claims, then Dean has every right to tell southerners to put it away, and it is Edwards who needs to explain why he speaks so proudly of growing up among whites with confederate flags on their pickups (even if he doesn't use that symbolism). Moreover, what has Edwards done to actually improve the lives of those people in all his years in Washington?  If the confederate flag is a symbol of southern heritage that northerners have no right to question, then Sharpton, a northerner, also needs to be silent about it. But if northerners have no right to weigh in on southern issues, the entire civil rights movement could never have happened. Edwards needs to apologize for even suggesting such a thing.  Howard Dean's statements in no way endorse the Confederate flag. His civil rights record, as the governor who signed the civil unions bill, is unquestionable. Dean is one of the few candidates brave enough to talk about race in a serious way that panders to no one.  If Edwards and Sharpton want to debate the meaning of the Confederate flag, let them. But leave Dean out of it.

       Two views on religious displays  Today's Idaho Statesman  urlLink editorial  called for the removal of the Ten Commandments monument on public land in Boise.  Meanwhile in France, president Jacques Chirac has supported a  urlLink  ban on headscarves and other prominently displayed religious signs  by students.   I agree with the Statesman, but not, this time, with the French president. As a secular person, I am very concerned about the display of religious symbols in a way that express official approval of one religious community over another. The Ten Commandments monument in Boise clearly does that.   But I don't feel that the wearing of scarves by Muslims schoolgirls in France does that. I understand that the French are trying to maintain a secular environment, but limiting personal expression of students is not the way to achieve that. Such a ban would only drive secular and religious people further apart and empower fundementalist radicals.

       Howard Dean makes statement on capture of Saddam Hussein  Click  urlLink here  (Window Media player required) for a video of a statement on the capture of Saddam Hussein by governor Howard Dean.  In the statement, the governor congratulated the US military, the Iraqi people, and the Bush administration for the capture of Hussein, and said that we now have an opportunity to bring in other countries and move from an American occupation to an international reconstruction effort.  I thought it was a gracious statement and a wise one not to attack the president's Iraq policy today. Governor Dean is planning to give a major foreign policy speech tomorrow.  For me the capture of Saddam in no way convinces me that the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq was justified,  or that Iraq had anything to do with September 11th or was an imminent threat to the United States. The question of whether Saddam will be tried according to international law remains to be seen as well.

       Bursting the bubble  I have read a lot of articles about Howard Dean by people who barely know him and are trying to understand the phenomena he represents. Many try to compare Dean to politicians of the past. Dean has been compared to past losers like George McGovern, Gary Hart, and even Ed Muskie by people who want him to lose. One of the most recent, and perhaps the most bizarre comparisons was by Cal Thomas, who actually compared Dean to Pat Buchanan.  Most in the media though, still claim that Howard Dean is swinging the Democratic party to the left, but the truth is that the media and the politicians have swung so far to the right that they don't even recognize how many Americans they have left behind. These Washington people  live in their own world, don't talk to anyone but themselves, and have lost all concept of what issues average Americans care about, and how concerned many Americans (who wouldn't necessarily call themselves liberal) are over what George Bush has been doing to our country and to our national reputation in the world.  This is why they describe Howard Dean as "angry" or "short fused". Because they can't concieve that a calm and rational person would be upset about anything our government is doing. That millions of jobs are being permanently lost, that the national debt has ballooned, that billions of dollars of taxpayer money are given in subsidies to wealthy Bush contributors, that the president lies to us about the war, are all seen as perfectly normal. Any suggestion that what is right is actually more important than what the rulers can get away with is viewed as odd at best, unpatriotic at worst.  In some ways this mindset is the political equivalent of the Internet bubble. Many of the dot.com investors believed that it didn't matter that the companies they invested in had no product, no business plan, and no experienced leadership. Anything that sounded high-tech and had the right buzz words was IN. It's as if investors were walking around with virtual reality helmets on. When the bubble burst, it wasn't just a stock price bubble that collapsed, but a bubble of self-delusion.  The Washington and corporate insiders who think they run this country are walking around in a similar bubble of self-delusion. They actually believe that they can ignore us, lie to us, send our jobs overseas, bankrupt our country, insult our patriotism, and we will just roll over because that is what the Democrats in Washington do. They actually think that Americans will put up with this garbage. Let them think that. I can't wait to see the look on their faces when the bubble bursts.

       Culture of growth  The Shell corporation has set up a  urlLink forum  to talk about the future of energy. Here's what I posted there in response the question of what the energy mix will be 2050.  I have looked at these questions before. While in college in 1990 I wrote a paper that looked at what the energy picture would look like in 2015. What I've learned since then is that many technologies can keep the lights on, it comes down to what people really value.  *****   What will be the dominant energy of 2050 cannot be completely known because it depends on the value systems of people.  Developed countries currently have a culture of growth in that the dominant belief of most people is that growth is good and that everyone can have more and more without limit. It uses a human-centered accounting that does not take into account the value of natural systems and values only that which saves or makes money. This culture also tells us not to worry too much about the long term consequences of what we do, that the future will take care of itself.  A new culture of sustainability is emerging where the value of natural systems and the reality of limits is recognized. It values the small, the elegant, the connected, and the eco-efficient. It considers our impact on "the seventh generation".  While the culture of growth is losing ground and the culture of sustainability is growing, both will exist for some time. People and institutions that value sustainability will invest in wind, solar, hydrogen fuel cells, energy efficiency, and so on. Others will defend the existing system as long as possible.   It should not be assumed that the culture of growth will simply give up when oil starts to cost too much to recover. Already some US politicians are talking about reviving the fission industry, even though nuclear waste is still an unsolved problem. Fusion should be much cleaner, but until it is actually implemented we won't know.

       Thoughts on Iowa and New Hampshire  Since coming back from Iowa where I spent several days hanging fliers and knocking on doors trying to get out the vote for Howard Dean, I have realized a thing or two. First is that the media is an enormously powerful force in this country, one which people believe is more real than a person standing right in front of them on their doorstep.   When the news media and the other Democrats attacked Howard Dean repeatedly in Iowa, it worked. Pundits, pollsters, and attack ads have more power to influence voters than an army of smiling young people making phone calls and knocking on doors. Dean won the ground war in Iowa with his 3000 volunteers, of which I was one. Dean with 18% of the vote soundly beat Gephardt whose union based ground campaign came in a distant fourth with 11% and out of contention.  But Dean lost the air war. Millions of dollars of attack ads and the equivalent of millions of dollars of negative media, fueled by mistakes of his own, almost knocked Dean out. The key word is ALMOST.  Dean survived, and even gained 10 points in New Hampshire in the final week. And he did it with mediocre TV ads and lots of volunteers. In two states, Dean has proven viable, something only Kerry can claim so far.  To survive the next few weeks, Dean needs to launch an air campaign. His satellite appearances in ten states today is a start.  He needs to fire his media people and create some new and better TV ads. And he needs to run them in every state that has a vote coming up.  Finally, he needs to figure out how to shine in the debates. He needs to stop talking about the Iraq war so much and start talking about how he has delivered in Vermont and his vision for the country. His excellent speech in New Hampshire is a start. But we need more than a start. We need some wins.

       An odd encounter at the office  Tomorrow I will be leaving for Iowa to campaign for the presidential candidate I support, Howard Dean. One of the things that makes me a little nervous about this trip is the prospect of having to encounter hostile or rude people in the process of knocking on doors or making phone calls for the campaign. It isn't easy to bite back my pride sometimes.  Yesterday I got a taste of what that was like when a coworker confronted me at work about the fact that I was supporting Dean (I have had a Dean sign in my cubicle for months) and ridiculed me, saying that Dean would lose because the war in Iraq was going well and the economy was picking up. "Where do you get your news?" I asked him. But I could say little else to respond to his ridicult as I was literally headed out the door to go home.   I talked to him today and he said he was just kidding around. He is a conservative Republican which I didn't know before. We talked politely about politics. Mostly he was curious how I had gotten involved in the Dean campaign and why. I told him about meetup and how it is organized on the Internet. He said he used to have a liberal friend at work that he liked to debate with. He move here to Boise from Colorado and I think he misses his friend and was hoping I would fill the same role. We'll see about that, but at least I will try to say hello to him more.  I've learned a valuable lesson here. Not everyone who seem nasty really is. I think I am ready to face whatever Iowa has in store for me.

       On machines and people  A quote by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. that was in the newspaper today got me to thinking. It was:  "When machines and computers, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered."  It got me to thinking how far I have come in my progressive thinking in the past few years. There was a time, when I used to be a libertarian, when I would have dismissed this statement as socialist tripe. Now I am not so sure.  We clearly live in a society where machines, profit motives, and property rights are considered more important than people. To see this one can observe that whenever the economy gets tough and a company has to cut somewhere, it is employees that are sacrificed rather than profits.   Another way of saying this is that payments to shareholders (those who are considered to have a property right in the company) are continued while payments to employees (those who are not considered to have a property right in the company) are not.  Viewed this way, it isn't so much an issue of property rights against human rights, it is an issue of the rights of some people (the shareholders) being considered more important than others (the employees). It is a case of some people being more equal than others.  Majorie Kelly talks about these issues in her new book  urlLink The Divine Right of Capital . I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to develop a deeper understanding of the culture of corporate greed in our country and how to change it.

       More thoughts on Mars  At the Democratic debate last night, the question came up about George Bush's soon to be announced proposal to have NASA focus on returning to the moon and Mars. Several of the candidates seemed skeptical, saying that NASA has existing commitments like the Space Station that need to be seen through.  As much as I would like to see humans go to Mars in my lifetime, I'm not so sure we are ready for that as a nation or as a planet.  Mars is a long way. Any mission to Mars is an over two year round trip, and rescue missions are not possible outside a narrow launch window. No foreseeable means of propulsion is going to change that for at least another century.  This means several things. It means that any human crew is going to be on its own once it leaves Earth orbit. It also means that the mission cannot carry all the oxygen, water, or food needed in a prepackaged form, but will be able to carry only a fraction of what it needs and recycle the rest in a closed loop life support system. Such systems can be fragile, and the breakdown of any part of it would mean the slow death of the crew. Other risks such as radiation from cosmic rays and solar flares remain. All these risks are present both in transit to Mars and on the surface of the planet.  Is a society that increasingly values security and safety, which is willing to eagerly give up its freedoms out of fear of suicide bombers, going to be able to stay the course and risk trillions of dollars to send crew after crew to Mars only to have half of the people sent die in the process? I'm not so sure.  I'm not sure that national pride or even science are worth such a cost. Perhaps the only goal worth it would be establishing a sustainable branch of human civilization on Mars, one that could survive even in the event of some cataclysm on Earth. But again, will a society that is increasingly focused on self gratification be able to summon the pluck and the resources for goals that could only benefit generations far in the future? Again I'm not so sure.  It seems that the kind of long range, open thinking required to create a sustainable civilization on Mars could also be applied on Earth, improving life right here and now. Once that is well underway the case for Mars will both be more compelling and more likely to be well recieved.

       Bush to announce plan for Mars, moon missions  The Bush administration is poised to announce plans for a roadmap to return to the moon and Mars, says  urlLink HoustonChronicle.com   While I am a strong supporter of space exploration, I have to view any space exploration initiative from the Bush administration with skepticism. First, the plan was drafted by a team led by Vice President Dick Cheney, whose secret energy task force was notorious for excluding public interest groups. Second, the Bush administration is clearly one of the most anti-science presidencies in our history. On issues like stem cell research and global warming, Bush has put ideology and industry interests before science every time. I don't believe for a minute that George W. Bush, a man too intellectually uncurious to bother reading the newspaper, understands much about what NASA is doing or cares about such questions as whether there is life on Mars.  The details that have come out so far also make no mention of  urlLink Mars Direct , brainchild of Robert Zubrin and one of the most well thought out plans for going to Mars as cheaply as possible. Without incorporating Mars Direct concepts like producing propellant on Mars for the return trip, any human mission to Mars is going to be prohibitively expensive.   That may be intentional. It may be that this initiative is just a distraction that Bush knows Congress will never fund. Sort of an intentional lead balloon, not unlike the expensive space initiative proposed by Bush's father that went nowhere fast.  One possible sincere motivation for this initiative may be the success of China's first manned space flight. Perhaps President Bush was embarrassed by the success of the Chinese in light of last year's Columbia space shuttle tragedy, and wants to reclaim the high ground in space. Announcing a new space initiative may be one way of feeling better about the American role in space without having to do much else.  I for one am working to elect a president who is both pro-science and pro-international cooperation and not bought and paid for by industry lobbyists. Such a president might actually get us to Mars someday rather than just talking about it.

       Carrying on the fight  Tonight the results are coming back from Wisconsin, and it looks like Howard Dean's run for the White House is over. Howard Dean gave an excellent speech on C-SPAN tonight, one of the best political speeches I have ever seen. In it he talked about how change is hard and we need to carry on the struggle to change our country.  It appears that he will go back to Vermont tomorrow and decide how to carry forward from here. I believe that he will announce tomorrow or Thursday that he is bringing his presidential campaign to an end. But that will not be the end of our struggle by a long shot.  I hope that the next step will be to create a 527 organization, a progressive alternative to the Democratic Leadership Council that will fund progressive Democrats for Congress though thousands of small donations.  I also intend on going to the Idaho caucus on the 24th wearing my Dean button, and will vote uncommitted in the first round. I stand by my principle that any candidate must earn my vote and my support.  In the next few months I will probably be talking less and less about politics and more about computer technology, one of my other passions. Howard Dean's internet campaign was in some ways inspired by the open source software movement, and in turn Dean's campaign has made me realize that corporations will never produce software that truly meets people's needs. Perhaps what the world needs is people-powered software development. I will expound on this more in the future.

       Cash and Kerry  When I said last Wednesday that Howard Dean should fire his media people and get new ads, I never expected that campaign manager Joe Trippi would be the one leaving the campaign.  The new campaign manager, Roy Neel, has a gutsy strategy to get the Dean campaign back on track. It is, quite simply to stay in the race, continue to build Dean's army of supporters, continue to pick up delegates, and wear down the other candidates until they wither under media scrutiny or run out of money. It is also to focus the campaign's money on states where Dean has the best chance of winning and with the most delegates at stake, starting with Washington on Feb 7, and Michigan, Maine, and Wisconsin in the days that follow, then moving on to the big states like Texas, New York and California.  The media is already scrutinizing Kerry's record. Once Kerry might have been able to claim he is a principled anti-war activist, but he has become a complete sell out. Unlike Dean who is raising money with thousands of small donations, Kerry is relying on big donors and bundlers just like George Bush. And these big checks come with strings attached. This MSNBC/Newsweek  urlLink article  is rightly titled "Cash and Kerry".  On C-SPAN this morning, a veteran called in to complain about what Kerry did by protesting the war in Vietnam. I don't have a problem with that, I have a problem with Kerry not uttering a peep of disapproval against the Iraq War when he actually had the power to stop it by voting against it. I also have a problem with Kerry railing against Bush's medicare bill when he failed to even show up to vote against it. I find it difficult to support a candidate who campaigns against his own votes and no-votes.  Howard Dean and Roy Neel's campaign strategy also does something else. It neutralizes George Bush's millions of dollars for months. If Bush runs ads now, who does he attack? If he attacks Kerry, Kerry withers and Dean emerges as the nominee. If Bush attacks only Dean, it confirms that the Bush campaign believes Dean is a greater threat to him than Kerry, which only helps Dean. If Bush attacks Dean and Kerry, once again it establishes Dean as a viable opponent to Bush. So Bush will do nothing for months, which also helps Dean.  Hang on folks, its going to be a long and wild ride.

       On the lighter side  Now for some lighter fare. One of the sports we really enjoy watching as a family is women's college basketball. It is much more of a team sport than the pro leagues or even men's college basketball, and you don't see near as many tattoos or gang insignia on the players. Our girls Caitlin and Hailey really enjoy it and of course it is a positive role model for them seeing confident and physically fit young women showing their skills.  Last night we were treated to an  urlLink excellent game  between UCSB and UConn. The higher ranked and more experienced UConn team faced a fiesty UCSB that just would not quit. April McDivitt, the small guard on the UCSB team, showed real spirit and determination, making steals and key baskets trying to keep her team in it before UConn finally won. Our girls were so impressed that the next day they asked Mom to do their hair in braids just like April McDivitt. They look so cute.

       A tale of false choices  In the February-March issue of Free Inquiry, Paul Kurtz calls for a  urlLink Free Market with a Human Face  and points out that "the free market is not a panacea for every social ill" and that health care should be a "human right". The next issue drew a letter from libertarian apologist Tibor Machan who defended free market capitalism as the "optimal socio-economic system", and from another reader who asked whether it is possible to be both libertarian and humanist at the same time.  The answer depends on how the two philosophies are defined. One of the principles of humanism is that "moral principles are tested by their consequences". This is particularly germane to the question of whether humanism and libertarianism are compatible because libertarianism is clearly a moral principle, a set of rules about what kinds of rules governments ought to make or not to make.   Libertarians often use moral and utilitarian arguments. Libertarians point to the failure of communism in the twentieth century as proof that capitalism is the best of all possible economic systems. At other times they will argue that liberty and property rights are matters of moral principle that should be treated as sacrosanct even if it could be shown that some other system for organizing human society produced better results.  But from a humanist perspective those arguments are quite different. To a humanist it is reasonable to debate whether certain systems for organizing human society produce better results than others, based on evidence. Such a discussion would not be trivial. Humanists who object to some of libertarianism's tenets would be quick to point out a number of flaws in the utilitarian argument for libertarianism.  Libertarians often speak as if free market capitalism and state socialism are the only possible choices. This is of course a false choice, because a quick look at actual governments and societies in the present and in human history show that the variations are more diverse than this simple model suggests. Nor is it simply a matter of categorizing all governments or even particular laws on some scale between two extremes. The set of possible laws is in fact a multi-dimensional space of perhaps infinite dimensions which has barely been explored. Libertarians acknowledge the multi-dimensional nature of law-space, but often speak as if it were all explored, and as if their little corner of space were the only safe territory, with the rest labeled "here be dragons".  The fact is that the question of what is the "optimum socio-economic system" has barely begun to be studied from a scientific perspective. It may be that there are only local optimums, which only apply while society is in a particular phase, but which are no longer optimum once a phase change, or what historians call a social revolution, occurs. If that is the case, it is naive to speak of any system of organizing society as optimum for all humans and for time.  It also seems naive to expect any society that reaches an optimum to stay there without effort. Even in a society that produces the maximum benefit for most of its people over the long term, there will always be those who would benefit more if the rules were changed to exploit others for their own personal gain.  A libertarian who was willing at least in principle to revise his opinions in the face of new evidence can be called a humanist, and can have a meaningful conversation with other humanists. But a libertarian of the second variety, who is unwilling even in principle to change his views in the face of new evidence, cannot honestly call himself humanist because his views are not scientific, but religious. For such a person, the belief in the superiority of the free market becomes not an article of reason, but an article of faith. That is where libertarianism and humanism must part company.

       urlLink BBC NEWS | Europe | Spain threatens Iraq troop pull-out  The election results in Spain are without doubt the biggest story of the past week. Three days after major terrorist attacks in Madrid, two days after 11 million people - a quarter of the population of the country - marched in protest against terrorism, the people of Spain turned out in huge numbers to oust the current conservative government and replace it with a socialist government, with the new prime minister declaring his intention to pull Spanish troops out of Iraq this unless the U.N. takes over running the country.  Some are already saying that the terrorists influenced the outcome of the election. However, it should not be assumed that those who voted for the socialist government did so out of fear or appeasement. When the people of Spain marched against terrorism this weekend, they were defiant and united. Many of those same people also marched against the war in Iraq. As it became increasingly clear that the Basque terrorist group ETA was probably not responsible for the attacks, I believe that many Spaniards realized that the Aznar government's support of the Bush administration's war in Iraq had not made them more safe.   It should also not be forgotten that the vast majority of Spaniards were opposed to the Iraq war, and as evidence points increasingly to Al Qaeda, the attacks reminded them of that fact and how the Aznar government had ignored them.  I believe the election in Spain shows that the world is changing. People are becoming smarter and the old appeals to nationalism and fear are beginning not to work. The people of Spain showed that they are determined to hold only their values and to resist the forces of terrorism and war at the same time.

       What happened in Idaho  The past few weeks have been completely crazy and I am still trying to catch up.  On Friday, February 20th, the Howard Dean campaign send me their entire list for the state of Idaho. Over 2000 records. Over the weekend Dean supporters in Idaho called or emailed 80% of the people on that list. We also worked hard at the Frank Church dinner to remind people that Dean was still on the ballot and they could vote for him.  Once the word got out that we were making an effort, the energy became contagious. The result was that over people turned out for Dean at the Idaho caucus on the 24th, especially in the counties where we had volunteers making phone calls. Dean got 11% of the state convention delegates in Idaho. It was one of the proudest moments of my life.  Making that happen required a lot of work and little sleep for several days. By the end of the caucus on Tuesday I was completely exhausted. I needed a vacation. My wife LeAnne got us a hotel room in Lava Hot Springs for the weekend. We took the kids and had a great, relaxing time.  Now I am back, and looking forward to being active in the Democratic party in Idaho, and taking back our county, our district, and our state.

       urlLink He'll Take Your Job and Ship It  ... and blame you for losing it.  The problem with American high tech workers, says professional outsourcer Atul Vashistha, is that we don't have enough training. We have to go back to school year after year, or lose our jobs. "That is the new reality of being competitive", he says.  But who created this new reality? Human beings did. Specifically, American politicians who voted for NAFTA and GATT and a host of other laws did. They agreed to globalizing trade without globalizing worker and environmental protections. They created the conditions under which Americans could not compete. Human beings made this "reality", and human beings can unmake it. In November it starts.  Vashistha's talk about "retooling" is an illusion. I've been retooling most of my life. I have been chasing the market for years. I spent years in college training for a career as a Mechanical Engineer, only to find out there were no jobs in that field for me. I am 41 years old, and I am still in school chasing a Computer Science degree, and still the market is not satisfied. I have no more job security now than I did 20 years ago. And I am supposed to go to school for another 20 years? When am I supposed to enjoy life? When do I get to see my children? Vashistha can take his 18 hour work days and shove it!  There is nothing more dehumanizing to a man than to put him in a position where he cannot protect his family. I have come to realize that no amount of education or hard work can provide economic security to my family. Not so long as corporate managers can throw workers away like tissue paper in search of profits for stockholders who never contributed a dime of capital to grow the company. I am happy to have a job, but I have no illusions about it being secure.

       urlLink BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | Picture emerges of Falluja siege  It is starting to become clear that the US has adopted new Israeli-style tactics in the seige of Falluja in Iraq. Some people may be skeptical that U.S. troops would shoot at ambulances or civilians. However, if true, it wouldn't be the first time civilians have been targeted by the U.S. government.  Most Americans have forgotten about the incidents at Waco, Texas and Ruby Ridge, Idaho in the early 1990s. I haven't. In 1993, I was a protester in Waco while the seige was ongoing. I was not sympathetic to the beliefs of the Branch Davidians at all. However I did not support law enforcement using military hardware against American civilians, whatever their beliefs.  I will never forget the arrogant faces of the FBI and ATF agents wearing flak jackets and machine guns. In their temperament and attitude most looked like members of street gangs. I will never forget the shame on the faces on the Texas law enforcement officers who formed a human barrier between the peaceful protesters and those thugs whose arrogance and aggresive tactics led to the death of 80 human beings.  I believe that most American soldiers would not deliberately target civilians. But I have also seen a darker side of the federal government that is quite capable of it. Which is in charge at Falluja? The military has made sure we may never know for certain.

       urlLink The Idaho Statesman - Boisean a rising star on behalf of pro-life cause  This woman is seriously fact-challenged. I will be writing a longer response to her nonsense soon.   UPDATE: I sent the following essay to the Idaho Statesman the day after this acticle was published but it wasn't acknowledged.   How ironic that the interview with anti-choice activist Brandi Swindell ran the same week as naturalist E.O. Wilson's visit to Boise. Swindell holds many misconceptions about religion, abortion and birth control, but her views on population and nature are perhaps the most misinformed.  How sad that on her nature hikes Swindell learned nothing of the intricate and delicate web of life that surrounded her, but could think only of waging cultural war on her neighbors. She could benefit from a hike with Wilson, who could double her knowledge of the natural world and humanity's impact on it in an afternoon.  Her claim that population is not an issue because there is plenty of room is not true. The issue is not how many people could fit in a Texas-sized subdivision. The issue is how much land, air, and water it takes to sustainably provide all the services people demand, and to leave some wilderness aside so that other species can survive as well.  One way to measure human impact on natural systems is the ecological footprint. Start with food. Your groceries don't just beam into Albertson's from outer space every night. They are grown somewhere on this planet. The land it takes to grow food just for you is part of your ecological footprint. Add a couple of acres for the trees it took to build your house. Add a few more for trees to absorb the carbon dioxide released providing you electricity and transportation, including transporting all the goods you buy. And so on.  Ecological footprint doesn’t measure some impacts such as air and water pollution, but it can tell you if nature even has a chance of sustaining the population if everyone in the world lived like you. The average ecological footprint of Americans is 25 acres per person. The collective footprint of all Americans is three times the land mass of the United States. That’s a lot bigger than Texas.  By comparison there are only 5 acres of biologically productive land per person in the world today. It would require almost five planet Earths to support everyone in the world in the life style of Americans. That’s also a lot bigger than Texas.  Swindell might be right on one point when she says marketing is a problem. Maybe she means condom marketing, but I mean the broader marketing culture that tells us every day we must have more: bigger houses, bigger cars, bigger vacations, bigger food portions, bigger everything. This culture of over consumption should be resisted. And there are many things we can do to reduce the ecological impact of our consumption, such as re-use, recycling and using alternative transportation and renewable energy when available.  But over time these choices will amount to nothing if we don’t also make responsible family planning choices. It should be obvious that having more than two children increases the pressure on a finite ecosystem. It takes more land to support more human beings, and nobody is adding more land to the planet.  By spreading lies about population and by opposing every form of birth control, not just abortion, Swindell is damaging the life prospects of future generations she claims to care so much about. And she is damaging the future of the natural systems she seems to enjoy.  The ecological damage humans inflict on the natural world is what naturalist E.O. Wilson warns us about in his book “The Future of Life” among other writings. Swindell might want to read it if she truly wishes to be “pro-life”.

       urlLink Arianna Huffington talks about talking to Republicans   Arianna Huffington talks about her journey from moderate Republican to progressive Democrat on Blog for America today.  I can relate to her journey. I was an active Libertarian for many years. I was attracted to their emphasis on personal freedom, but over time I came to realize that like conservatives, their economics reduce people to abstractions.   Libertarians' only answer for such questions as how do we care for the least fortunate always could be boiled down to "the market will provide". Children or the environment or other things that people care about but that government shouldn't get involved in would be taken care of "somehow".  This belief that the market will always provide for human needs is a religious belief. The reality is that much of what markets produce are toys for people who already have more than they need. Markets don't understand need, only ability to pay. That's why they can never be the complete answer to the human equation.

       Another democracy says no the right  One of the most surprising and hopeful outcomes of the Bush administration's war on Iraq has been a series of shocking reversals where right of center governments have been ousted in elections and left of center parties have been swept into power in democracies around the world. First in Brazil, then in Spain, South Korea, now in  urlLink India .  While it is true that all politics is local, I believe these results are part of a larger global trend. News of the horrific social cost of the Iraq war has been the top story all over the world for the past year. Most of the people in the world were against the war and that has not changed.  Governments that went against the will of the majority of their own people and allied with the Bush administration are being held accountable. Even more hopefully, right wing governments that were not necessary close to Bush are being viewed with suspicion by the people. Blatant lairs like Bush have a way of casting doubt on those who even sound anything like them.  These new governments will have great opportunities but also little margin for error. Many of these parties were themselves ousted by voters because of corruption. Many cling to outmoded socialist economic ideas. To the extent that these new parties focus on progressive issues like peace, jobs, health care, and the environment, they will be successful. But if they return to their old ways, they could quickly see voters looking for alternatives. This is as true for the Socialists in Spain as it is for the Congress Party in India and the Democrats in the United States.

       Thanking Sheila Sorenson  Once in a while one gets the opportunity to play a small part in something larger than one self. When that opportunity comes, don't pass it up.  Last Monday I was invited to attend a gathering of supporters to say thanks to Sheila Sorenson, a moderate Republican legislator from Boise who is retiring this year. Sheila did a very brave thing this year. She used her position as head of the State Affairs committee to block a state constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage in Idaho.   I was glad to attend even though I'm not a Republican or a voter in her district. Over a hundred people turned out on a rainy day. It was amazing to see such a diverse group of people coming together to thank a legislator for her courage on this issue and many others.

       urlLink Torture at Abu Ghraib  I've chosen not to post any comments on the horrors of the Iraq prison scandal during the past week, to give myself time to calm down and to wait for more facts to come out. The above article by Seymour M. Hersh in  The New Yorker  describes the lurid details of what happened at the prison in Iraq and how it could have possibly happened.  Also see a BBC  urlLink video interview  with the same author.  "It's clearly widespread, this is clearly a policy decision ... This goes into the Pentagon ... goes back to Afghanistan, the mistreatment began there and continued into Iraq ... Rumsfeld knew about this within six days ... it's self-deception on an enormous level ... somebody told them what to do."  As disgusted as I am by all of this, I cannot say that I am completely surprised by it. See my earlier post about Falluja. Despite all the protestations by Bush that "Islam is peace", I've believed that the Bush administration basically views the war of terrorism as a holy war between Christianity and Islam, in which Muslims are considered less than human. I've suspected for a long time that the Bush administration was evil as well as stupid, but how evil and how stupid wasn't obvious until now.  When it sinks in that this was in fact a policy decision by the Bush White House, I expect that heads will roll and you will see calls for impeachment. Stay tuned.  My blog now supports comments, so feel free to express your opinions.

       Lies and legends from the religious right  Apparently there are several  urlLink urban legends  circulating around the Internet as emails claiming that the ACLU wants to remove crosses from cemeteries or stop soldiers from praying. This is designed to inflame the passions of religious conservatives. If you get an email like this, please don't forward it. The claims in the email are untrue, and the people quoted in the email don't even exist.  In general it is a bad idea to forward any message saying "forward to everyone you know" or the like, especially if the original sender of the email is not indicated or is unknown to you. These are almost always hoaxes or urban legends (or as Al Franken would say, lies told by lying liars!). If you forward a lot of such things to your Internet friends you may find that you stop hearing from them because they may conclude that you aren't very bright.  This doesn't have to happen to you. You can quickly find out if an email is a hoax by doing a Google search on key words in the first sentence of the email and adding the word "hoax" or the word "legend". This will usually turn up a web site that documents the hoax. Remember, think before you click!

       urlLink Yahoo! News - Hitler Image Used in Bush Campaign Web Ad  The Bush campaign's use of ads comparing Al Gore and Howard Dean to Adolf Hitler proves several things:  The Bush campaign is growing desperate and will use any means, fair or foul, in its attempt to steal our democracy.   The Bush campaign has no institutional memory or any concept of logical argument. On the one hand, they say with a straight face that John Kerry is responsible for the constitutionally protected speech of one of thousands of people who entered a MoveOn ad contest in January, content over which neither Kerry (who was not even the presumptive nominee at the time) nor MoveOn had any control. At the same time they argue that the Bush administration is not responsible for the illegal torture of Iraqi prisoners by U.S. soldiers, men and women sworn to follow Bush's orders and to whom the Bush administration gave policy direction. Huh?  I'm not sure which is scarier, the idea that they think the American people are so stupid we won't notice this contradiction, or that perhaps they do not even notice it themselves.  Finally, this ad proves that anything you post on the Internet can and will be used against you. Think before you click.

       urlLink Boston.com / News / Boston Globe / Opinion / Op-ed / How about Howard?  There seems to be a growing "Draft Howard Dean for VP" movement, as this article shows. While I would love to see Dean in the White House, I don't expect Kerry to pick Dean as his running mate, if only for geography reasons. But if not Dean then who? Kerry needs to find someone with a fire in his belly. I don't have a clue who it would be, but Edwards is not it. He comes across as likeable but is just not exciting, and he isn't a progressive. After Dean I would choose would be Carol Moseley Braun, but alas I don't except Kerry to do that either.  At this point Dean is probably better off to remain an independent voice, outside of the Kerry administration. Maybe head of the DNC. But I'm not holding by breath on that one either.

       Why Kerry may be repeating a classic mistake  Yesterday I got my first fundraising letter in the mail from the John Kerry campaign. In the letter, Kerry talked about how his campaign was competitive in fundraising against George W. Bush and other things. He then talked about Bush had "no plan" for getting out of Iraq, "no plan" for fixing the economy, and so on.  While it's true that George Bush has no plan for anything, and while this might sound great in a Senate filibuster, it would be a mistake for Kerry to harp on this too much. To do so would be to make the election "about competence". If that phrase sounds familiar, it should. It is the phrase that Michael Dukakis carried to defeat in 1988 against the elder George Bush.  Kerry doesn't seem to be willing to go after Bush where he is most vulnerable: on ethics. The whole world knows that Bush lied on the justification for going into Iraq. It is becoming clear that soon after 9-11 the Bush administration was interested in using torture and building a legal justification for doing so with impugnity. Kerry should be asking fundamental questions about the kind of America Bush is creating with these horrific policies, and how un-American they are.  Instead Kerry seems to be repeating the Dukakis play of trying to make the election about Bush's competence rather than Bush's morals and credibility. If he continues to do this, he will come across as elitist. Also, the more he talks about Bush's incompetence, the less time Kerry has to talk about his own vision and policies. If that continues he could lose the election. That's something the country simply can't afford.

        Revolution  is a must read  This morning I finished reading Joe Trippi's new book  urlLink  The Revolution Will Not be Televised: Democracy, The Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything  . This book is a must read for progressives everywhere.  The book is written in the blog style of personal conversation. Trippi uses plenty of humor to tell the story of his life in politics and the rise and fall of the Dean campaign.  But interwoven with Trippi's personal story is a broader story, of how television has eroded our democracy, and how the Internet is helping citizens to reclaim it.  The implications go beyond politics but to business as well. Trippi warns that businesses that do not embrace democracy in their dealings with customers and employees will get run over by those who do:   What this democratizing means for American businesses is that they have a choice now: Embrace a more open, responsive era, or make a doomed stand against progress. Cling to the old top-down structure, or radically reinvent the way you do business. The companies that survive and thrive in this new age will be the ones that respond to the three demands that this movement will make of corporate America:  1. We want businesses that empower consumers 2. We want corporations to be responsive to shareholders 3. We will only tolerate companies that are good corporate citizens.  This is the real choice for American companies. Will they willingly invite their customers inside or push them away? Will they listen to small groups of shareholders or wait until they band together and take over the boardroom? Will they stop polluting and start taking care of their employees, or will they wait until we force them to do it?   That will be fun to watch, and to help make happen.

       Carter stands out for Democrats  The Democratic National Convention opened today. I started out watching the coverage on PBS, but when the feed went down we switched over to C-SPAN and will be staying there. No talking heads!  Most of the speeches were the typical stuff of a coronation convention: testimonials about how Kerry was a war hero and how every demographic group under the sun was supporting him. Word was that the Kerry campaign was vetting all the speeches, so when President Jimmy Carter took the stage and delivered a tough foreign policy  urlLink speech , I can't help but wonder if that was by design.  Without naming Bush directly, Carter talked about how the great Presidents of the past served in the military, didn't mislead us, didn't initiate "wars of choice", and didn't squander our greatest assets of "truth" and "trust". This gentle elder statesman gently but firmly put Bush squarely outside the mainstream of American foreign policy.  Bill Clinton had a strong speech but not nearly as powerful to me. The best part was when he said that strength and wisdom were not incompatible. This is clearly branding because several other speakers called Kerry "strong and wise" over the course of the evening.  The strangest part of Clinton's speech was when he tried to attack the Republicans for heartlessly defending a tax cut he once supported and which he kept referring to as "my tax cut". I can't believe he won any votes for Kerry with that argument.  I look forward to seeing what Governor Howard Dean will have to say tomorrow. Here's what Dean had to say in an email to his supporters today:  " I will talk about how far our party has come in the last two years and how crucial this election will be to the future of our country. I will talk about John Kerry and make it clear that he is the man who will bring the fundamental change we need to right our course.  "I want you to know that as I stand on the podium tomorrow night I will not be there because of anything I did. I am here because of you. Together we have built a real force for change and I am deeply grateful that you have let me be a part of it."  No, Governor Dean, I am deeply grateful that you let me be a part of it. You gave me back my flag and my country. Now we must make sure they are never taken away from us again.

        I, Robot  Rocks the House  This evening I went to see the new sci-fi action film  I, Robot  starring Will Smith. I have long been a fan of Asimov's robot novels, especially the Caves of Steel series, which represents some of his best work. However, I tried to go in without any preconceptions, and as a result I was able to enjoy an excellent film without chaining it to the novels. There are strong echos of Asimov here, but only an echo, like a robot dream.  In the movie, set in a transformed 2035 Chicago, Will Smith's character, detective Spooner, is a troubled homicide detective who is alarmed at the growing presence of robots in society. Spooner, who has a personal reason for hating robots, soon has his fears confimed as a visionary robot scientist dies in an apparent suicide. Spooner soon suspects foul play at robot hands.  The computer-generated city scape as well as the detective story are strongly reminiscent of the Caves of Steel novels. The film also resurrects the character of Dr. Calvin, the robot psychologist from the original I Robot stories. Played well by Bridget Moynahan, the character of Dr. Calvin becomes more human as the story progresses. I was half expecting her to become Smith's love interest but thankfully the movie stopped short of that point.  Don't let the action footage, or the nude shots of Will Smith at the opening of the film, or the only slightly human looking robots fool you. Australian filmmaker Alex Proyas has created a significant science fiction film with a human subtext that captures the spirit of the Asimov novels while also being an original and important piece of work.  For another perspective see this article on the filmmaker from  urlLink Australia News .

       urlLink Is Iran next?   President Bush is trying to make the case for an Iranian connection to Al Qaeda. Could he be planning the next war?   Bush's stated policy is that he reserves the right to invade any nation whose government he suspects of harboring terrorists. Bush has also listed Iran as one of his "axis of evil" nations. These facts make his raising the issue at this time quite significant.  Bush seems to have already decided that Iran had something to do with September 11th. Notice his language: "We will continue to look and see if the Iranians were involved." NOT "We will continue to try to find out if any national governments other than the Taliban were involved".  His comments about Iran being a totalitarian regime is a thin justification for invasion. It could be said of many countries around the world, including Saudi Arabia, the country where most of the September 11th attackers came from. In some ways Iran is actually a more liberal country than Saudi Arabia, for example, in the freedoms that women have.   One thing is certain, that there is no way the U.S. can occupy Iran without a military draft. Iran is a far larger country than Iraq with many more people who will defend their nation vigorously. Even the younger generation that wants reform would side against an invading American force. It would take far more troops than a volunteer army could ever produce. Iran equals the draft, period.   We simply cannot allow this man to be re-elected.

       Getting around to it   I hope everyone had a great Fourth of July weekend. I like to use long weekends to catch up on those tasks about which one always says "one of these days, when I get around to it..."  On Saturday we spent the day with LeAnne's brother Jeff and his family in Middleton. The high school there had a fairly large fireworks show, there was a clear view from the backyard, also a lot of the neighbors were firing off rockets of their own. We love small towns on the 4th, the celebrations seem more genuine somehow. The only downside is the bug bites, inevitably somebody gets a few. Caitlin got a nasty one on her foot that may have been a bee sting but she is recovering.  On Sunday and Monday LeAnne and I worked on painting our bedroom from white to a dark forest green. It took the whole weekend but we really love the result. It makes the room look more peaceful and restful. One lesson we learned the hard way is to avoid plastic drop cloths, newspapers work much better. Another is, don't leave a paint can in the work area, it will get knocked over sooner or later.  Monday afternoon I finished the web site for the   urlLink Idaho Progressive Caucus . This is a project I've been excited to get up and running all summer. At this point it's just a series of static web pages, but one has to start somewhere. The next step will be to get some PHP code in place to make the site more interactive.
