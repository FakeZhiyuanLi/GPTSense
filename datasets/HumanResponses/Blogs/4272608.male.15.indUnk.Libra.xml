      Why do I have to call family members that I haven't seen for years to wish them a happy birthday? It is most awkward, and pretty useless. You say happy birthday, they say thanks and then there is that awkward silence. Not only is it uncomfortable for the caller, but for the receiver as well. "Happy Birthday" doesn't even mean anything anymore. It is just something we have to say. If you did mean it, then you would use some other phrase which is synonimous, like "hey, have a great birthday".  While writing this, I was watching the History Channel (Oh my, they've discovered that there is more to history than WWII!). During the commercial break, they advertised a brand new type of telephone, which they called a "revolutionary product". Apparently this phone solves many of the problems of the old phones, like buttons. It is also "the easiest phone to use". Who the fuck has trouble using a phone? Who in the world has ever gotten to the phone and complained about having to deal with buttons. Who has ever said "Oh, woe is me! I wish someone would invent something and free mankind from the grip of buttons!"?

      I've been fooled by ironic lefties before, but is  urlLink this  site real or what? Holy poop.  Check this shirt out:  urlLink http://www.thoseshirts.com/images/sam500.gif   That is just some of the milder stuff.  Oh man, I love ignorance. This two party system rivalry is driving this whole country fucking insane. Today I saw some kid slap a John Kerry button from another's hand. Is this where we are folks? The Democrats call the Republicans sheep and the Republicans call the Democrats brainwashed, while in the end they are both right. They can't pull their heads out of their asses to notice that you can pull bits and pieces from each side and that there is more then two choices on any given issue.  The truth is that I am going to start punching hardcore "YOUR POLITICAL ASSOCIATION HERE" in the anus. Can you think of a more primal punishment for such repulsively primal behavior?

      Remember those "ancestor" projects we had to do in middle school and stuff? Yeah, well my ancestor was this medieval alchemist who dabbled in the reanimation of flesh (he is mentioned in  Frankenstein ). That is all nice and good, but he had "von" before his last name. I want one too. Apparently it was used by royalty, but now everyone uses it. All I know is that adding a "von" to my last name would be fucking spiffy. I could go around and tell everyone that I am a baron and hold land in Germany. I also have to wear contacts, but only my left eye is really bad, so I could get a monocle.  Baron von Nettesheim. You wish you had such a cool name.

      First post, just a test. No need to get your panties in a bunch. Just so you may be slightly entertained, enjoy this "burn".  Evan: Dude, look, I didn't give that girl a chair and now she is on her knees, ahahahaha. Me: Enjoy it Evan, for that is the only time you will ever get a girl on her knees.   OH SNAP PLE
