       Been listening to Evanescence's &quot;My Immortal&quot;. I've listened to it before, but its meaning hasn't resonated with me more than now. I've been feeling rather lonely. It's simple, mostly just Amy Lee singing and the piano. This is probably my favorite type of music. Savage Garden's &quot;Two Bed's And A Coffee Machine&quot; is another good example of how well voice and piano do together, but alone.

       This is pretty cool. I just got a plug-in to GAIM so that I can post to Melancholy Surprise from it. Not quite as integrated as I'd hoped though. Oh well.

       The type of music we tend to like and listen to, not only reflects our current mood, but often is a reflection of our personality at different stages of life. As I was thinking about my past tastes in music, I saw how this was true in my life.  I feared showing any form of weakness as a youth, so resisted the temptation to be drawn in by music. I saw how it controlled people's emotions when they would watch movies. I didn't want to be controlled.  Around 11 or 12 years of age, Kirk introduced me to a lot of music, most of which I listen to and enjoy now. It was also at that time that I got my hands on some Peter Cetera tapes. I think I related most to the song "Solitude/Soliaire", as I was extremely introverted towards strangers at that age.  Just recently I bought Peter Cetera's "Greatest Hits" album. Now that I am dating Kristi, I relate to a lot of his love songs. "S.O.S" is probably my favorite as far as rhythm and sound go, but its lyrics are about lost love, so I don't really relate to them. I relate much more to "Feels Like Heaven", "Happy Man", "Faithfully", and "She Doesn't Need Me Anymore". There are other love songs on there that I'll probably appreciate more later in our relationship.

       It's been several days now since my last post. I'll try to recall some of what has happened. I got my "Pager" script working for the most part which has been a big boon for me, as I've been stressing to finish it for some time now. It felt like my progress on it was going too slow. Afterwards, I played Hearts with Kristi and Jared on Yahoo! games. We played for several hours. It seemed totally foreign to me at first, but after awhile it started feeling familiar. I think I probably have played it with a group of people many years ago. Kristi left as soon as I started to get the hang of things which was disappointing.  I woke up early so that I could take a shuttle to Chicago. My work group had a meeting with a group at the University of Chicago which works there. I didn't really participate much in the discussion. Much of it was presentations. I got a lot of clean up work done on my Pager project during this meeting. That was satisfying. I left around 3:30pm and was dropped off at my office building 221. I stayed there for a few minutes and then went home. I slept for many hours. After I awoke, I worked on implementing a sorting algorithm that I've been toying with for a few years. I call it Lazy Sort, but it'll probably fall victim to change. I returned to sleep around 1 or 2am.  You'd think with all the sleep I got, I'd be well rested and ready for work today, but I wasn't. I got up around 10:30am and didn't get to work until 11am. Probably got 2 hours of work done today. I mostly fiddled around with my sorting algorithm. After work I ended up IMing for an hour or so with Heather, Kristi, and Steven (all separately!).  I spent several hours IMing with Peter. I was hoping to play some more Hearts with Kristi, but that hope has fizzled now.

       This year I only saw a few fireworks due to the huge overgrowth of trees and a sky which always seems have an eerie glow. What I could not see I heard--multitudes of them. The skyline was continually flashing. The fireflies certainly seemed livelier than ever. Probably in some way due to the fireworks. I think I may have figured out why we using fireworks to celebrate the 4th of July. It's because they sometimes sound like gun blasts. It gives you a small sense of what it would have been like to have fought in the Revolutionary War.

       After reading the pamphlet, I started to walk to Darien (around 5 miles) to return a DVD and get a haircut. The path I've taken in the past is simply to follow Cass Avenue north until I hit Darien. It's very straightforward. This time, I decided to try a different path, as I dislike all the noise and commotion of walking a section of Cass which goes over the freeway. However, the longer I walked along this other road, the more I became convinced that it would never cross over or under the freeway and that I could end up walking it indefinitely and never get where I was trying to go. So I turned around.  I wasn't really frustrated, because I felt I'd learned a life lesson from this experience. Beforehand, I was contemplating how hard it would be to give up all my possessions, as it seems God would like us to do. You might recall, as I did, the man who asked Jesus what he needed to do to inherit eternal life. Jesus responded by saying that the man needed to sell everything and follow him. This was too much for the man to take as he was quite wealthy. Thus, even though he kept the 10 commandments, he couldn't attain to the kingdom of God.  The lesson for me was that no matter how far you walk away from the goal you can always return, but there is a price to pay. I had to rewalk that same road in reverse to get back on track and so must we retrace our steps to get back on track with God.  I finally got to Darien and headed straight for the haircutter. However, I found that they are closed not only on Sundays, but also on Mondays. No sweat I thought, I'll just go over to this other one I know of. But again, they too were closed on Mondays. I don't think it's a temporary thing for the holidays either, because the print at both locations seemed to be pretty permanent. Kind of wonder why they have Mondays off. So I'm thwarted from getting a haircut for the second time, but I am getting a little wiser each time. I think I shall call ahead next time.  When I returned the DVD, the rental place gladly took it back, but charged me $14 for the inconvenience I had caused them. With the rental price added to that, I probably could have bought the DVD. Oh well, live and learn. Next time I'll have to double check the cases to make sure I don't send them empty (or with the wrong DVD in them).  So I walked back to my office. By the time I got there, I was tired and sweaty, but surprisingly not as sun-burnt as I thought I'd be. Maybe it'll take a day to kick in.

       Cherie told me yesterday evening that she was reading a pamphlet entitled "A Call To The Churches In America". She said she really liked it. I remembered that I had gotten that same pamphlet from Bill and Eve during conference. I had already read some of it, but didn't get very far, as I wasn't in the right spirit at the time. I went home around 10pm last night and did some laundry. After which, I started reading that pamphlet. I enjoyed it so much that I read about 3/4 of it. Then, this morning I finished reading it at work.  Although it's historically interesting, it was the spiritual content that most interested me. It brought to my attention the meaning of a parable Christ once told about how a man who wasn't religious would help a widow to "get her off his back", so to speak. He makes the point that God would do the same for us, but that we must ask (pray) continually as the widow did.  The need to pray and the need to separate ourselves from the world and our earthy possessions, were the two primary themes that I got from this speech. The author tells us that we need to pray not only continuously, but also emotionally. We must cry when we pray. I hope to reread it, but this time with a highlighter.

       I'll bet I look absolutely crazy today. I slept in longer than usual and the longer I sleep, the more my hair sticks up later. I usually fix these bad hair days with my "Got Root" hat, but today I accidently left it home.  After doing some upgrades to my system, I nearly locked myself out of Linux. After several hours fixing a few things, I finally got things back to normal. Whew!  Although much of day has been a headache, there are a few things I've enjoyed.  I ate what I think was my first chili dog. I really liked it. It contained chili-beans, a hotdog (of course), chopped onions, and ketchup (I think).  I've decided my favorite song today is a duet between Peter Cetera and Ronna Reeve, titled SOS. I've listened to it several times now. My favorite part is the background vocals at the beginning and toward end. I think Peter's and Ronna's voices really work well together in this song. It's a very passionate song, full of life. I just realized that I have no idea what this song is talking about. I think I'll go study the lyrics.  It sounds like it's about a couple who fell out of love with each other and now miss the love they had.  After getting myself something to eat from the grill, I played poker online with Cheri and kept playing hours after she left.  Looks like Steven has his mentor over playing cards. I wanted to discuss relgion with them, but now I don't think I'll be able to. I'm feeling pretty depressed. I can't describe how lonely I feel.

       Getting to bed around 3:30am last night, I didn't wake until around 10:30am. I walked straight to work. I'm thinking I might get some work done today. We'll see.  On my walk through the woods to work I noticed how a thick over-growth of leaves has enveloped nearly everything. It's interesting as you walk because you quite frequently hear squirrels, and who knows what else, scurrying beneath the underbrush.  Today is hot and muggy. I expected the humidity to be high from what I'd seen on www.weather.com, but I also expected thunderstorms, which as of yet have not shown themselves. It's just a weird lightly foggy haze.  I did get some quality work done. Although, I'm still unsatisfied with the quantity.  Spent several hours replying to a very short email from Kristi, the details of which I'll keep between her and myself.

       Apparently I forgot to check the DVD case before sending it off with Liz M. On a hunch I check my DVD drive and there it was. I'm a little frustrated to say the least. I guess I'll have to take it in Monday, when I go to get my hair cut.  I baffled Kristi and Heather with the word "anachronistic". I'm quite pleased with myself. I feel like the dog in "A Dog's Tale" by Mark Twain.

       I must confess I've found this site very accessible. It amazes me how well they've made it so simple, yet so functional. I'll take my hat of in a moment of appreciation to all you who've worked so hard to make this happen. Thank you.

       My eyes seem to be finally clearing up of the gunk that they've been producing. I don't know if I've acquired allergies or whether it was due my contacts. I took my contacts out last night because I figured they may have been at least partially responsible. Who knows, it might just be a fluke, but my eyes seem to be much better today.  It's hard to believe how tiresome this has been. Every morning for the past several days, I've woken up having my eyes nearly glued shut and at work I'd be continuously wiping it from my eyes. All that rubbing caused the area around my eye to get dry and hurt. To combat the dryness, I started carrying around a tube of lotion, which helped a bit.  I woke up late since I played "Texas Hold'em" Poker with a few of my roommates last night. We played with some of our spare change. Things started good, but I ended up loosing everything in the end. I blame it on luck. Because I didn't get to sleep until after 1am. As a result I didn't wake up until around 9:30am. Hence, I got to work later than my usual 9:00-9:30am, at around 10:30am.  I must have just spaced out for several hours (a la Office Space), because I can't quite remember what I did. I think I spent it IMing with Steven W. I went to lunch, came back and IMed some more. I had planned on getting some work done today. Just no ambition I guess. I've been quite distractable.  I did get some stuff done. In an IM conference I set up with Cheri and Kristi, we did some school class rescheduling so that we could take more classes together. I'm a little disappointed that I won't be able to take French 101 with Kristi though. I'd really been looking forward to that. I've already taken this class, but I figure I need a refresher. Kristi wants to take French II with me the following semester and I fear unless I take 101 over again, I won't be prepared for it. I'm still a little unsure whether I want to take by myself though. I've got it set up to take Sign Language with Kristi too. However, she told me not to. She seems to think it'll be way over my head, and she may be right, but I think I'll rush in where angels fear to tread on this one.  I decided at some point that I wanted to read a romance novel and who better to ask about which ones to read than Heather, Kristi, and Cheri? So I posed a slew of questions to them, probing them to find out which I should read. I've now got two authors and 5 books that I'm considering. Here they are  Jude Devereaux "Sweet Liar"  Johanna Lindsey "Gentle Rouge" "Silver Angel" "Gentle Feuding" "Hearts AFlame"  I read reviews and excerpts from all of them and must say that the one I want to read most is "Sweet Liar". Heather told me she's already mailed it and now I'm waiting with baited breath for its arrival.  After awhile, everyone but Heather seemed to have left the IM and she wasn't responding, so I decided to call to see what they were all doing. Apparently Heather and Steven left to have lunch with Steve's mentor. Kristi was reading a Jude Devereaux book (I wish I'd asked which one) and Cheri was watching some show.  I was feeling a little tired so I went into a conference room and took a nap, as I've been in the practice of doing. I didn't sleep too well as maintenance seems to have an overly agressive cooling system going.  When I woke up I was feeling a little lonely and dejected. Then an idea hit me. I've always wanted to keep a diary and what better way to do it than make it accessible to family and friends. So I found www.blogger.com and began writing. I think this really helps me to sort out my thoughts.

       What to write, what to write. There's so much to write and yet where do I start. Ahhhh!!! My first case of writer's block. And so early into my career.  I can see my epitaph now: "He may have been a brilliant writer, winning the hearts of millions, had it not been for the writer's block which stroke him so suddenly."
