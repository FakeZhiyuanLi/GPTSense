      Got a phone call from my brother Pete the other day telling me that Dad hasn't been well.My Dad is 88 years old and  been in a old peoples home for 4 years.Until quite recently he's been in reasonably good health, but his mind has been going . He's got senile dementia, its got to the stage where the ppl at the oap-home cant look after him anymore, so he's being moved to a home dedicated to his condition. I havnt seen Dad in 6 years, i wish i had, thats the problem with emigrating to the other side of the world its a lot harder when somthing happens to family back home. I'm in two minds wheather i should go an see him, Pete said thats it would be a shock to see him now, or should I just remember him as he was.

      The day after I got my new iPod, Apple anounced a new version - typical ! they dropped the 15g version and knocked $100US off the price with longer battery life too. Just my luck, but i dont care I like mine a lot.

      Got a new gadget over the weekend, an 15g iPod and its brilliant. Loaded almost my entire music collection onto it, and there's still 10g free space left. Like most apple stuff its beautilfuly designed, but it really needs a protective cover, the chrome plating on the back looks like it will scratch very easily, a remote control would be handy too.

      I love shoot-em-up games and my favourate game at the moment is Wolfenstein Enemy Territory.  One of the great things about the game is that there is a version that runs under Linux and even better is that its free, no need to reboot to windows have fun (er i mean work :-) ) any more.

      The Company I work for had upgraded Laser printers a few months ago to a fancy ( and huge) Kyocera FS9100, The old printer a  Minolta PagePro 20. had been gatering dust in the back room and  was about to be chucked into the rubbish skip. Well I thought is was too good to miss and ended up taking it home, hoping to sell for few bucks. Well after some investingation on the local on-line trade.me it turns out there are lots of lasers (in apparently perfect working order) for sale at next to nothing with aboslutley no bids, Looks like I'm left with a large and heavy door-stop, that pleases my partner, Maria heaps..

It turns out there hope for me yet  was reading the blogger homepage & there was details of a woman over 80 yrs old posing blogs, wonder if il be in a fit state to handle the technology that will be around in 40 years time.Just been to see Spiderman 2, was worth seeing, better than the first film i thought which makes a change sequels are ususally crap. IÂ´m tired, time for bed.
