      Last night some teenagers were vantilizing the neighborhood. They are probably at this time at home laughing about it. WOW how retarted is that? I mean come on. Only little kids vandilize people's homes and propertys. But I guess they are little kids since they do that kind of stuff. Oh well, I'll walk out there a little later and see if anyone needs any help with anything. Well I need to go get ready for the cookout today. Laterz!

      I have relatives in North Carolina that have no intentions of telling me anything at all. First, 3 weeks after they call me and tell me that my grandad had died! Thanks appreciated the soon news! Second, we call down there saying we were going to come down and see granny, and they decide that she doesn't want us to see her in that "state". Yeah right and pigs fly! Now yesterday I find out that my granny died, and of course they haven't called to inform us! We had to find out about it on the internet. What great relatives I've got. They don't even care enough to tell me stuff. I REALLY APPRECIATE IT EVERYONE! Well, I hope I never have to talk to them again. The only people down there that really cared was granny and papa slone.Well everyone else can go screw themselves I never want to see them again.

      My Next Thirty Years   I think I’ll take a moment, celebrate my age The ending of an era and the turning of a page Now it’s time to focus in on where I go from here Lord have mercy on my next thirty years  Hey my next thirty years I’m gonna have some fun Try to forget about all the crazy things I’ve done Maybe now I’ve conquered all my adolescent fears And I’ll do it better in my next thirty years  My next thirty years I’m gonna settle all the scores Cry a little less, laugh a little more Find a world of happiness without the hate and fear Figure out just what I’m doing here In my next thirty years  Oh my next thirty years, I’m gonna watch my weight Eat a few more salads and not stay up so late Drink a little lemonade and not so many beers Maybe I’ll remember my next thirty years  My next thirty years will be the best years of my life Raise a little family and hang out with my wife Spend precious moments with the ones that I hold dear Make up for lost time here, in my next thirty years In my next thirty years

      Friendship is like the breeze, You can't hold it, Smell it, Taste it, Or know when it's coming, But you can always feel it, And you'll always know it's there, It may come and then go, But you can know it'll always be back. - Terri Fanning -

      Hey, Dad, look at me  Think back, and talk to me  Did I grow up according to plan?  And do you think I'm wasting my time  Doing things I wanna do?  But it hurts when you disapproved all along  And now I try hard to make it  I just wanna make you proud  I'm never gonna be good enough for  You can't pretend that I'm alright  And you can't change me   [Chorus]  ‘Cause we lost it all  Nothin' lasts forever  I'm sorry I can't be perfect  Now it's just too late  And we can't go back  I'm sorry I can't be perfect   [Verse 2]  I try not to think  About the pain I feel inside  Did you know you used to be my hero?  All the days you spent with me  Now seem so far away  And it feels like you don't care any more  And now I try hard to make it  I just wanna make you proud  I'm never gonna be good enough for you  I can't stand another fight  And nothing's all right   [Chorus]  ‘Cause we lost it all  And nothin' lasts forever  I'm sorry I can't be perfect  Now it's just too late  And we can't go back  I'm sorry I can't be perfect   [Bridge]  Nothing's gonna change the things that you said  And nothing's gonna make this right again  Please don't turn your back  I can't believe it's hard just to talk to you  But you don't understand   [Chorus (2x)]  ‘Cause we lost it all  And nothin' lasts forever  I'm sorry I can't be perfect  Now it's just too late  And we can't go back  I'm sorry I can't be perfect    This song is for my Dad. I hope he reads it one day.

Did some vacuming and skimming, then came home early and had to help mom cut grass. Then came inside and took a shower. That felt so good. After that I ate pizza for dinner. Then I watched Full House and 7th Heaven. I love those shows. Thats all for now.

      Pretty much same as yesterday. I woke up, washed my face and hands. Then I put my swimsuit on and headed to Hardees this mornin for breakfast and ate a bacon,egg,and cheese biscuit, then I headed off to work. It rained some during my shift, but it was fun swimmin in the rain durin work since nobody was there. Then it cleared off. After I got off work it was so nice that I stayed and swam until 5:30. After that I came home and took ashower. Then I talked to friends online. I got inturrupted by dinner, but of course I didnt mind. Thats all for now, have a great evening. Love always.

      This mornin I woke up at 7:00. I seem to wake up the last few days at that time for some unknown reason. I turned the tv on and watched Saved By The Bell. I used to watch show every mornin when I was in elementary and middle school. Then I got up and washed my fdace and brushed my teeth and got on here, talked with friends for a lil while, then got dressed and went to breakfast. Of course I went to Hardees. Then I had to go to the bowling alley to ride with James and jessica to pick out the trophies for bowling. I actually got to make the choices. I felt special. Anyway, after we got done there we went back to the center and mom picked me up. Mom went to Wal Mart while I was with Jessica and James, while she was there she bought me the new Joe Nichols "Revelation" CD. I would highly recommend it to anyone. All of the songs are awesome. Then of course she had to go to Dollar Tree, she loves that store way too much. Then as my luck would have it, we got stuck in there because it started pouring down rain. I wasnt very happy to say the least. Then we came home and I ate a cheeseburger for lunch. Then I got back on here and am doin pretty good. Ohh yeah one more thing, it rained so I didnt have to go to work. HALLELUJAH. ROFL. Yall have a great afternoon. Love, Carson

      This mornin I woke up at 7 again , why does my brain make me get up then. Anyway I got up, came in comp. room and watched Saved By The Bell. After that about 9 or so I went to Shoneys for breakfast with my mom. Dad was supposed to join us, long story. Then we went to Barnes & Noble and I got some very good chocolate frozen type of coffee yeah, whatever its called. Then we went to Wal Mart and of course I had to see someone I knew cause I had that chocolate stuff all in my teeth. I ran into Danielle and her bf Ben. Luckily she didnt notice, dk about Ben though. Great seeing them. Then I came home and helped mom with the grass. Now I'm on here. Have a great evening. Love, Carson

      This mornin I had to get up at 8, mom called the house @ 6:30 to wake dad up, so needless to say I wasnt very happy. Anyway I got up, brushed teeth, got dressed and went to Hardees for breakfast of course. Then I got to work around 8:45. Daycare came at 10 and didnt behave very well. I got off at 2 and of course as soon as I was about to get in it started raining. So I just got out and came home. I came home and got in the shower and now I'm watchin Pastor John Hagee then Pastor Rod Parsley. Dont know what I'll do after that, probably wait for full House to come on at 6. Anyway have a great afternoon. Love Carson
