      I doubt you wanna hear about my sad attempt at a life so I'm gonna write a happy blogging blog:  I like Boulder because it's such a small peaceful place. I'm glad I live on such a wonderful street with such great friends. I am excited to go to a new place next year and make new friends.   My favorite things: Horror movies Making movies with my friends Going to Pearl Street and just walking around Frappacinos Puppy dogs Flying on planes My (uh, my sister's) hammock The chicken dance Fudgecicles Fake doggy dooky Tire swings Musicals Being in plays Sleeping Reading a good book in a comfy place Last day of Summit First day of High School Friends Cookies and milk Watching movies in the theater Laughing so hard it hurts Strobe lights My fog machine!!!! Having nothing to do Walking through Blockbuster for hours on end Double sided tape Music

      Gosh darnit, lately I have felt so sad.  I don't know why, I just feel like I don't fit in anywhere.  I'm afraid for high school, cuz I judge people too quickly and of course no one likes that.  I'll make fun of everyone before I have a chance to meet them.  Of course, I've been trying to change that and it's been working, but I don't think I'm ready for the big high school environment.  I haven't really been to a big school before.  I have felt left out...I don't think it's because of my friends, they are very supportive and everything.  I just feel like I don't belong and that I'm losing my close friendships.  Homework has taken over my life.  I can't do anything anymore.  All I do is go to movies with my friends...not the best hang out activity.  No talking, just sitting and watching a movie.  Ever since my two friends have been going out, they never talk to me anymore online.  I occasionaly ask a question and they answer it, but then the rest of the time they talk to eachother.  I guess I'm happy that they're such good friends and can talk, but now I've been left in the dust alone.  I don't have serious conversations online anymore.  My conversations are always stupid and immature, and It's just wasting my life.  Ugh.  No one probably reads this unless I tell them to, and I'm not planning on telling anyone to read about my boring who-gives life.  Goodnight...and If i don't see ya, Good morning, Good afternoon, and Good evening as well.

      I'm a bit upset, but I think everything will be ok...I wont go into details though cuz I dont feel like it. That was completely pointless.  I am so glad we are done with Geography...the final was really pretty easy (not saying much though, cuz all exams are easy but I get like C's on them...NOT A GOOD SIGN!)  I feel kinda sick.  I have a bad headache and I'm really tired, so I'll go to bed once I'm done with this blog.  This bl*gging blog.  Hehehe that still cracks me up.  Well goodnight all...Goodnight room, goodnight porridge, and goodnight to the little old lady whispering hush.  Goodnight keyboard, goodnight mouse, goodnight all of my little house.  Goodnight friends, goodnight IM which i've been on since noon, and goodnight moon.  (Don't laugh at me...I love that book.  My poem is good too.  It is!!  IT IS!!!)  Anyhoo, night all!

      I'm sitting here at my computer thinking of good ways to die.  That is what I do in my free time.  Actually, I'm writing another movie and I need a lot of accidental death scenes.  I have had two ideas so far and I need about 8 more!  Please please please help me...They have to be easy to film, nothing at the bottom of the sea or burning someone to a crisp.    I am so happy with how Rebecca turned out.  It was such a great movie.  It had tons of blood at all the right times, and it had tons of scares when you least expected them.  Oh my, it was a great movie.    My new one is a mix between Nightmare on Elm Street and Final Destination, and it's gonna be FREAKY!  Trust me when I say it will, cuz Rebecca scared everyone. :-D  Bye for now...

      Who thinks up these words?  I think I may have created a new slang word:  Blogging.  Sam's Blogging Blog.  Think what you may, It is not a bad word.  It will not become a bad word until I suddenly dislike this whole blog thing.  Then it will be a bl*gging blog (censored for the younger ears...eyes...whatever.)  Today, I'm going to see Shrek 2!!!  I'm going with Laura, who is pretty much my sister, and her boyfriend who is one of my best friends...this is weird.  I'll be sitting behind them sticking my head inbetween them to make sure they dont do anything...I am very protective of my Laura.  I grew up with her...except I did not invite her to my Wizard of Oz party...long story, nevermind.  Hmm.  Only 2 weeks left of that school which will remain unnamed.  Y'know, I didnt really want to go to Summit...oops it slipped out, I'm sorry for those of you who were alarmed I used such language in a blog.  K, S*mmit.  There.  A new bad word.  How charming.  AAAAnyways.  I didnt want to go to S*mmit.  I wanted to go to Baseline. but nooooo. My mom wanted me to be just like my sister.  At least I could choose which high school I can go to...but my parents wont support me at Fairview cuz they dont want me to go there.  They will never drive me there or pick me up...ever...and they probably wont be willing to come to my plays or anything.  Thats nice.  I feel so loved.  They dont support my decision.  DEAL WITH IT MAMA AND PAPA!  K Thats all for my first blogging blog.

      Ya know, a lot of my friends have boyfriends and girlfriends.....then I think about myself....I'm single, but I'm fine with it.   I don't really think 14 is too young an age yo have a girlfriend, I just haven't met that "special person" yet.  (Don't laugh, I know its cheesy) I don't wanna be like some people who just go out with someone for the heck of it...Like Tabby and Eli...she was like "Oh, I need to get a boyfriend to prove I'm not bi.  Oh look theres Eli!"  So they went out for a few days....Yeah that's not too romanitc if ya ask me. I'm not sure if I'll even know when that "special person" comes along (hehehe that sounds so cheesy) because I'm so used to being single.  K this is getting boring.  I am super sore from teh Bolder Boulder....I ran the whole thing!  Anyways, I gotta go to sleep.  2 days left!!!!!!
