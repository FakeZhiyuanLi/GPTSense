      I was skimming through channels last night waiting for  The Late Show with David Letterman  to come on when I stumbled upon some good, old-fashioned Christian television.  The main topic of discussion that night was about Michael Moore,  Fahrenheit 9/11 , and basically how wrong it is.  Liberals around the world, if they saw this programming, would go "Whaaa?".  Granted, I haven't seen the movie.  However, through clips and commercials (and an oddly-placed trailer when I saw  Envy  in April), the movie paints a cinematic picture of how Bush isn't exactly  wrong  for going into Iraq, but he triggered events that directly led to the invasion.  These ÜBER-Republican religion buffs didn't bother to mention anything about the plot of the movie or what Moore tried to accomplish.  Instead, they accused him of being "Anti-Bush" and encouraging kids to go vote in November (two things I'm positive Moore is).  However, these motives were brought in a negative fashion.  On another note, the following was a question (not directly quoted, because I didn't exactly write it down) from a viewer):  "My church is creating a recreational center for its youth.  They are including books, a foosball table, and Xboxes (X-boxs, as they put it).  Are these items okay for a church atmosphere?"  And, the response (also not directly quoted), which starts off innocently enough but turns into a very narrow-minded reply:  "Children need something to do, so I think the games are okay for the children.  Youth are not going to go to something that is, well, boring.  As long as they realize that they are in a house of God, it will be okay.  A good idea would be to include God-related video games, which I would imagine they included.  I don't want to see any 'Grand Theft Vice Auto Town 3' shooting bonanza.  Children should learn to be faithful whenever possible, so religious games, I feel, are the only solution.  Foosball is too violent, so I do not suggest that.  Books are good, although the only book kids should be reading is the Bible, for the Bible rules all.  Bibles will also prevent homosexuality from spreading since it clearly states that God does not tolerate a man lying with a man like he would with a woman.  You know what, scratch all that.  Games and books are not good in a church, for it detracts from the Church.  All kids should value God in His house, and that will be the child's fun throughout his youth.  Vote for Bush."  I realize I made that last part up, but these guys are very extreme.  He also contradicts his Grand Theft Auto beliefs by stating that he is a prominent defender of the Second Amendment (the right to bear arms, for all my uneducated friends).  Hmm.  I think it's funny why conservatives are confused why people don't like Bush and his supporters.

      I could go on forever as to how bad he is, but I leave you with some  urlLink underlined words .  Self-explanatory.  This is from  The Daily Show  from Comedy Central.  You need RealPlayer.  Vote this year, if you can.

      I have a serious issue with the dieting fad America has undergone.  There are too many examples of how Atkins is ruining the world.  - McDonald's, in what I feel is a response to "Super Size Me" (which I no longer have the desire to see), recently created their Adult Happy Meals, which consist of a salad and a bottle of water.  That's it.  What a meal.  Starving Ethiopians would demand more. - The simple fact that McDonald's offers salads is really a joke, if you think about it.  I can't imagine some trucker going down I-95 and thinking the following: "Wow!  There's a McDonald's at this exit!  I need a salad!" - Burger King (which is way better than McDonald's, in my humble opinion) has seven low-carb sandwiches available.  Counterpoint: on this menu is "The Angus", which was quite possibly the best burger I've ever had from a fast food venue. - Subway has their low-carb wraps available.   - Every food item possible that can have the Atkins logo on it has the Atkins logo on it.  Look around.  The gym commercials you see on television are eminent of this too.  The main reason most gyms give for why people should come there (Bally comes to mind) is to resolve a "lack of energy".  Maybe they'd have more energy if they digested some carbohydrates every once in a while.  Of course, the capitalist pigs we live under have to make money somehow, so the energy drink craze happened.  There are too many.  Granted, some of them, like the Snapple Elements drinks, are very good (albeit only six of them are energy drinks, and they are pretty hard-to-find).  However, how many energy drinks are there?  Red Bull.  Amp.  Rockstar.  Sobe.  Erektus.  Red Stallion.  Some of them are just ridiculous. - V8, that tomato-ridden veggie-juice that is "okay", has come out with Invigor8. - Rappers' energy drinks, like Pimp Juice or Crunk, are just marketing ploys and gimmicks.  However, the worst gimmick, by far, belongs to Gay Fuel.  That's right: Gay Fuel.  Don't believe me?  Here's some  urlLink underlined words .  America, we have a problem.

      The party I worked at yesterday could be described in two words: "white trash".  - The garage we played in was bigger than the  house  trailer. - They didn't make enough hamburgers and hot dogs, so they had to serve sausage and sausage patties.  They sure like their sausage. - For every one can of (Sam's Club) cola there was, there were ten cans of beer.  A large assortment of beer, too.  I witnessed cans of Molson Canadian, Labatt Blue, Bud Light, and Miller Lite being devoured. - Nobody brought a gift for the graduate.  That answers my question for the Saturday after next. - We played a lot of country music and classic rock, including all ten and a half minutes of "Free Bird", all eight and a half minutes of "Paradise by the Dashboard Light", all eight minutes of "Stairway to Heaven", etc. - We had to play overtime, so the job got extended to six hours.  However, I got paid $50.  If only I could get some new CDs before I leave next week.  I have my eyes set on Muse, The Killers, Velvet Revolver, etc.

      Today, I have to DJ a graduation party that is five hours long (ugh).  This is good for me because:  a) It's my dad's birthday.  Since I'm working with him, I really can't get him a present. b) I get paid from this job, hopefully in an amount exceeding $60. c) I can look at what the girl's friends get her.  I'm looking for the cheapest tolerable gift to give someone for a graduation party, because Kathleen's party is on July 10th, and I need to get something.

      Since it was a nice day today, I decided to ride my bike for a good hour and a half.  One of my stops on my journey was to the card shop downtown.  I play Magic: The Gathering.  So sue me.  I'm aware of the stereotype Magic players get.  We live in our parents' basements.  We do nothing but play the game.  Our entire paychecks go towards new cards.  Most of these players are over the age of twenty-one, though.  I'm just a casual player.  I'm more into music than the card game, to be honest with you.  But, it is fun.  That, and my fellow counselors at camp hold large Magic tournaments during our free time.  It's fun.  What I don't like are the  other  card games out there, such as Pokémon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Duel Masters, Harry Potter, etc.  They all copied from Magic, because Magic has been around since 1993.  The earliest any of the other mentioned games came out was around 1998 (Pokémon).  However, I could contradict myself by saying that all card games of this nature (as well as all RPG video games and fantasy novels) are inspired from books by authors such as J.R.R. Tolkien.  That explains the popularity of those  The Lord of the Rings  movies (none of which I have seen, nor do I intend to).  Whatever.  It's just something I do, and it's fun.  End of rant.

      Well, today was the annual PC Open, in which the Chemistry students face the Physics students in a rousing (not an arousing, mind you) game of miniature golf up on Harris Hill.  There had to be partners.  Originally Kieran was going to be my partner because we had discussed our strategy earlier.  We were going to be Team Ramrod (his decision... it's from  Super Troopers , but it sounds dirty).  Then, Grund decides that teams should be boy-girl.  So, I'm stuck with Katie.  Just great.  Kieran and I still played in the same four-person group.  Both of us patent the pool-cue style, but I usually don't lie entirely on the ground... I don't trust what's fallen on those greens.  I ended up with a 51 (when 36 is par) total.  Kieran got 40.  Then, all of us went to Friendly's for some ice cream.  Everybody else got these tiny little Happy Ending sundaes, but I went with the five-scoop serving.  It took me less than five minutes to get that thing down.  I am a beast at eating ice cream.  So, while I suck at putt-putt, I got ice cream out of the deal.  Plus, I didn't pay for it.  Life is good.

      You all know who this guy is.  Political activist, former Rage Against the Machine video director ("Sleep Now in the Fire"), and director of documentaries such as  Bowling for Columbine  and, his latest work,  Fahrenheit 9/11 .  I don't have a problem with the guy's attempt to reveal inadequacies in the government.  I just want him to follow through with it.  Case in point: David Letterman last week.  On the show, Moore practically apologized for his anti-Bush remarks he made at the Academy Awards.  That, and he laughed at everything he and/or Dave said.  I think he's high.  Or maybe he's replaced Tony Blair as President Bush's prison bitch.  If you're going to go anti-Bush, don't just stop your momentum.  I mean, when you have a movie criticizing the entire White House staff for what happened three years ago, you can't just say "What I did was wrong."  No.  Doesn't happen.  I think he's just trying to soften up his image in order to get more people to see the movie.  For one thing, though, I don't want to see Moore for two hours on a movie screen.  And I'm sure he's in the movie way more than he should be.  In short, Michael Moore's fifteen minutes of fame are way over.  He needs to work at McDonald's with that guy who made  Super Size Me .

      Do you think Americans have the ability to come up with their own ideas in today's world?  If so, go remove the blade from an operating blender with your bare hands.  Read below for two examples of how wrong you are.  Google, being the evil conglomerate that they are, decided that they just don't do enough yet, so the brainchilds of that company have created their hellspawn.  It sends.  It receives.  It has a tacky name.  It is GMail.  That's right: GMail.  It's just like e-mail, but, you know, it starts with a "g".  Clever, no?  Also, I'm sure you've seen the latest video for Velvet Revolver's "Slither".  Don't get me wrong; it's a good song.  However, check out videos from a group called Bauhaus.  Check out the similarities.  Hmm.

      Yeah, I have another blog.  I felt... deprived.  Lacking.  Bored.  The title still holds strong more than two years after its original conception.  I'm going to try and be a little more experimental with this thing.  For now, though, I have to see what this is all about.  Blogger's gone under quite the overhaul since I last posted.  Start dusting off the armor from your closets.  I'm back.

       Scott Weiland plus remnants from Guns 'n Roses equals just that.&nbsp; And it's nothing new.   I could go into how cliché Weiland's lyrics are about lost love and drug overdose and stuff.&nbsp; I could go into how the drums and bass are relatively tame while Slash is left to dominate over them.&nbsp; I could go into how "Dirty Little Thing" is almost a mirror image of "Sucker Train Blues", albeit not as good.&nbsp; But I'm not.  I'll just say this: the CD is, at best, average, unoriginal, and trite.&nbsp; It's still semi-fun to listen to, though.  Rating: 3/5

       "Declare this an emergency."   With that opening line, this disc starts into its head rush of pounding guitars, eerie keyboards, and other instrumental effects that will astound you as it continues onward on its odd path.  I have to say it.&nbsp; They sound quite similar to Radiohead.  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing.&nbsp; "Blackout" and "Butterflies and Hurricanes" feature some Baroque-esque classical instrumentation that appears out of nowhere, yet it fits in well.&nbsp; Electronic rhythms dominate in songs such as "Hysteria" and "Apocalypse Please".&nbsp; A return to earth occurs with the pounding guitars of "Time Is Running Out" and "Stockholm Syndrome", my favorite track.  Overall, this CD is very good.&nbsp; Is it perfect?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Is it vital to your collection?&nbsp; Absolutely.  Rating: 5/5

       Floyd meets Freud.    &nbsp; Well, this is an interesting little CD.&nbsp; The drummer is astonishingly powerful, albeit he uses simple rhythms.&nbsp; The instrumentation is very atmospheric and dark. &nbsp; The main thing that confuses me is the title track, which is a mere reprise of "Nowhere Again".&nbsp; Oh well.&nbsp; They trip it out.&nbsp; It's good. &nbsp; A must-add to your indie collection, and one of the best pieces of art (yes, art) I've heard in years. &nbsp; Rating: 5/5

      Kathleen's party was better than I thought it would be.  Sure, there were less kids there (a dozen or so), but it was a good time.  I also learned that I am awesome at badminton.  I leave again at 9:15 A.M.  I should be sleeping.  Campers begin to arrive tomorrow afternoon.  It should be fun.

       The down-home comedian's swan song may be his best work yet, although without the trademark "redneck" shtick.   Jeff Foxworthy has been releasing albums since the immensely popular  You Might Be a Redneck If...  in 1991.  This album, his fifth album of new material, may be his last according to the acknowledging liner notes.  That hasn't stopped the comedian from churning out some great material.  For instance, everybody knows about the Cialis ad from the Super Bowl, but only Foxworthy would comment that if he were in the hospital, he would make sure to wear the robe backwards and walk around.  Larry the Cable Guy makes a few unnecessary cameos in the CD during the introduction and encore, but he seems to enhance the CD this time.  He doesn't just yell "Git 'er done!" every two seconds, either.  The only qualm about this is that some of the material can be seen on  Blue Collar Comedy Tour , but all the repeated bits are absent from the soundtrack.  All the audio is new for those whom do not prefer movies.  Rating: 4.5/5

       The Cure meets Nirvana with a dash of the Beach Boys.   I'm fortunate I don't rate on an aesthetic value.  If I did, these guys would suck.  Their lead singer, Lauri, has very dramatic hair with feathers abound in the quaff.  It's strange.  And yes, I realize Lauri is an uncommon name.  The band is Finnish.  The other three members are named Pauli (guitar), Eero (bass), and Aki (drums).  The album is very good.  The sound of the Rasmus is a rock-oriented groove with catchy melodies and haunting vocals.  There are also some interesting stereo effects in some songs (namely, "Guilty" and "In My Life").  The two singles released from the album so far, "In the Shadows" and "Funeral Song", are both very good, albeit a little too radio-friendly.  However, no deduction is made from this, for mainstream radio has yet to grasp onto these guys.  Rating: 4/5

      I am home early this week.  I had to get a physical today in order to receive working papers; otherwise, I would not be getting paid.  Therefore, my dad picked me up today.  Camp is fun.  I work in the Dan Beard program, which consists of teaching the youngest of Boy Scouts a healthy portion of requirements needed to rapidly advance.  My co-workers in this field are Edelman, Sodl, Mark, and Jesse, all of whom are nice guys.  DSL (bleh) hook-up is happening as I speak, so I should be able to post from camp in the near future.

      The following article I have taken from  urlLink Something Awful 's home page.  It's just too appropriate.   Happy 3rd of July everybody!  On this monumental day a few hundred years ago, America threw off the oppressive shackles of the tyrannical English overlords, and won her freedom by throwing sacks of tea into the ocean, and setting traps just like the ones the Ewoks made in  Return of the Jedi .  We celebrate this great day by drinking a lot of beer, getting sunburned, shooting off dangerous fireworks into the sky and sometimes at each other, depending on how intoxicated we are.  Unfortunately, many Americans don't even know why they are lighting those snakes on the sidewalk and sticking flags in their ears.  Most of the public is ignorant when it comes to the history of this great nation.  Even in rotten old rainy England, when they are not too busy ejaculating over Harry Potter, they teach about how they got totally owned by the colonists, big time.  It's really a shame and I think knowing about the American Revolution should be required for a citizenship, driver’s license, and forklift certification.   Have a safe holiday weekend.  I go to camp tomorrow.

      Yep.  There is one.  And, surprisingly, it's on MTV2, which I bashed in the previous post.  I happen to enjoy  Spider-Man .  I don't know why.  The former cartoon versions are kind of lame.  The movie was good.  The MTV Cartoon just seems... right?  I now watch the MTV2oons blocks that are on the channel.

      Noticing a pattern with my anti-television beliefs?  First, there was MTV.  The Anti-Christ.  Sure, they  used  to play music videos.  Then, they created  The Real World  back in 1992 or so, and that channel ended.  Have you turned on MTV lately?  It's all reality shows contemplating the importance of the differences between chicken and tuna.  VH1 was okay, for a while.  Nowadays, the entire VH1 programming consists of three things: - Countdowns featuring rehashed clips from previous shows -  The Fabulous Life of  (insert celebrity here) - Pointless VH1 "Goes Inside" specials  Then, there was The Box... for eight months or so, anyway.  This channel (hosted by MuchMusic, I believe) allowed viewers to call in and request videos.  It was nothing but videos.  Its demise came on January 1st, 2001, when it was replaced with...  ...MTV2.  This was  my  channel to watch for a good amount of time.  I mean, last year was great.  On Saturdays, 8:00pm was  MTV2 Rock Countdown , hosted by Dee Snider's kid, and  Headbanger's Ball  followed at 10:00 (which I'm now a little scared to watch).  The time for the countdown has been pushed back to 7:00, Jesse got the boot because the network opted for Jim Shearer, whom I hope gets teabagged by an elephant, and MTV2 mainly airs - guess what - reruns of MTV's current lineup.  (To add insult to injury, MTV now has created MTV Hits and MTV Jams, two new stations that "play music videos 24 hours a day".  Sound familiar?)  Fuse.  Fuse was the Holy Grail at one time.  I hope they get their act together, because Fuse has started to play rap.  That is bad.  Fuse was the indie/rock/alternative station that I love so much.  They haven't irritated me all the way yet, but they're starting to with this  Daily Download  bull, as well as possibly the worst show they have:  Authentic Hip-Hop . (Fortunately, this comes on at midnight, when I'm preoccupied by David Letterman.)  You want some real music?  Check out this  urlLink link .  Pitchfork Media has some good album reviews for CDs that matter (and some that don't... *cough* Kanye West *cough*).  Or, you could download on whatever software you use (BearShare is my favorite) what I'm listening to.  By the way, that song by The Secret Machines is quite possibly the best song I've heard in quite some time.  Thanks Letterman (again) for introducing me to them.   MY SONG LIST (07/02/04)  - The Hives "Walk Idiot Walk" - Fall Out Boy "Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy" - Midtown "Give It Up" - Onelinedrawing "We Had a Deal" - Gomez "Silence" - Motörhead "Terminal Show" - The Postal Service "Such Great Heights" - Elefant "Misfit" - Jamie Cullum "All at Sea" - Phish "Scents and Subtle Sounds" - My Chemical Romance "I'm Not Okay (I Promise)" - Bad Religion "Los Angeles Is Burning" - Keane "This Is the Last Time" - Jet "Rollover DJ" - Snow Patrol "Run" - The Rasmus "Guilty" - The Secret Machines "Nowhere Again"

      I hate coffee.  You would too after having to serve it for over five straight hours to helicopter pilots, ambulance drivers, policemen, and members of nationally accredited search-and-rescue squadrons because a staff member got lost in the woods with a (female) camper.  They were found at 5:40 A.M.  I didn't sleep.  On a different note, I changed job positions at camp.  I used to work at Dan Beard; now, I am the dining hall steward.  Squeak, who held the job previously, had to leave for a NOAC conference in Ohio.  I bought two CDs.  I'll review them in the future.  For now, I leave you with some thoughts.  When exactly does late end and early begin?  Winston Churchill is accredited for saying "Never, never, never give up."  Does the public really think he was the first person to say this?
