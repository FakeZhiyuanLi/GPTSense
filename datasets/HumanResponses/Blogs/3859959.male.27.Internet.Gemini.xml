      The Terminal is a movie from Steven Spielberg starring Tom Hanks, Stanley Tucci, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and an ensemble cast.  The Terminal follows the story of Hanks' character as he gets stuck in the international terminal of an airport.  He gets pretty much permanently stuck there since his country suffered a military coup while he was in mid-flight and all passports from his country have been revoked.  This movie is another great pairing of Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks, who last paired up for Catch Me If You Can with Leonardo Di Caprio.  There is magic throughout this movie as we follow the lives and interactions of everyone in the airport around Hanks as he touches their lives.  All in all, it's a great story and you definitely walk out feeling good about the world.  We really liked the Terminal.   The Terminal movie review final score: 8/10

      There is a serious question that requires more thought than you might think: Is there really any movie that is better than  urlLink Army of Darkness ?  Army of Darkness is literally one of the funniest movies of all time. It's a horror movie that makes fun of itself the whole way through. It's a constant stream of hilarious one-liners, purposefully bad special effects, great characters, and those totally random moments that make a great comedy able to watched over and over.  Army of Darkness is truly the ultimate cult classic movie.  This movie has so many great one-liners it's hard to keep track:    Gimme some sugar baby.   Sure, I could have stayed and been their king, but in my own way, I am king. Hail to the king baby.   Yo, she bitch. Let's go.   What? Were you raised in a barn? Shut the door! Probably was raised in a barn, along with the other primates.   Maybe. Just maybe my boys can protect the book. Yeah, and maybe I'm a Chinese jet pilot.   See this?! This, is my BOOM stick!   Good. Bad. I'm the guy with the gun.    Sam Raimi has made quite a name for himself lately with the Spiderman movies, but it was his great beginnings in the campy horror genre which really defined him as a director and movie maker. If you've ever seen Army of Darkness or any of the other Evil Dead movies then you'll surely recognize the scene in Spiderman 2 when Doctor Octopus kills everyone in the hospital surgical ward. It's classic Sam Raimi horror that's straight out of Army of Darkness.  So if you haven't seen Army of Darkness yet you have to!   Army of Darkness final score: 10/10    Interested in Army of Darkness?  Find out more:

      Wow.  That's the best way to start a Spider Man 2 movie review.  Another way to start a review for this movie could also be, "when does Spider Man 3 come out?"  Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and company are all back for Spider Man 2, and they all brought their best games.  On top of great acting, amazing effects, fast paced action, and an engaging story, we again get terrific direction from Sam Raimi.  Spider Man 2 is even better than the original  urlLink Spider Man movie .  One of the biggest reasons for this is the villian Doctor Octopus.  Not that the Green Goblin was a bad villian, it's just that the acting, expressions, and development of Doc Ock were simply superb.  His robotic tentacles had personalities all their own that made him as a villian even cooler.  The other great thing about this movie is the comedy.  Even though there are some pretty heavy issues that Spider Man has to deal with through the movie, there are lots of laughs to break up the sour mood that might be forming.  If you like action, comedy, effects, and suspense, then you'll love Spider Man 2.   Spider Man 2 movie review final score: 10/10    Interested in the original Spider Man movie?

      We saw I Robot on its opening night on Friday, and let us say that it was exactly what we wanted. There was a little bit for everyone...action, special effects, comedy, and pretty good plot.   Perhaps the best part of I Robot was the character development of Sonny, the robot who Will Smith must befriend, despite his intense loathing of robots in general, in order to solve the quest he's been sent on by an old doctor. Sonny was built unlike any other robot and actually ended up having true feelings and saving the day with Will and Bridget Moynahan.   There were twists and turns all along the way and we never guessed the true enemy that made themself known at the end of the film. It was actually even better writing and plot than we were expecting from this action blockbuster. There was genuine ingenuity and cleverness at every turn.   The only thing we have to complain about is the supposed timing of the film: 2035. The reason that we have issues with this isn't that we don't think that robots will be walking among us in 30 years, it's that the filmakers somehow think that every road, highway, and transportation system in the greater Chicago area will be totally rebuilt in just 30 years. Now that's futuristic thinking. But, we can't blame them too much since it's the same mistake we've seen in just about every movie set in the near future.   Other than that, though, I Robot, was a great movie that we throroughly enjoyed and didn't want to end.    I Robot movie review final score: 9/10   &nbsp;

      Ron Burgandy lives up to his reputation.   Anchorman was a great comedy with wacky humor, great one liners, and hilarious characters.   Just to give you an idea of just how wacky Ron Burgandy can get, there's a scene where we discover the anchorman's amazing jazz flute talents. "Jazz flute?" you say. Yes, the anchorman plays the jazz flute.   Will Ferrell was terrific, but perhaps the funniest person in the whole movie was Steve Carrell, who played Brick, one of the dim witted sidekicks of Ron.&nbsp; In just about every scene that Steve was in he stole the show with the dumbest, yet funniest, comments.   We totally recommend this movie to anyone who loves wacky comedy, or anyone who happens to currently be in&nbsp;a " glass case of emotion " (see the film and you'll get it).    Anchorman movie review final score: 8/10  &nbsp;

      So we all know that getting a bunch of kids together to throw balls at each other for sport is a great idea. But who knew dodgeball would also make an awesome movie?!    urlLink Dodgeball  the movie again pairs Ben Stiller (White Goodman) and his wife, Christine Taylor (Kate Veatch), but this time they're on opposite sides. She ends up with Vince Vaughn (Peter LaFleur), who plays a struggling gym owner who's trying to fend off a takeover from Goodman's evil Globogym.   It's amazing how it just doesn't get old to watch grown men and women dress up in weird costumes and get hit by balls. It's hilarious.   Rip Torn (Patches O'Houlihan) also plays the crotchety old "Dodgeball expert" to perfection. His one liners are fall out of your seat funny throughout the movie.I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll only leave you with one bit of advice from Patches:    You're about as useful as a poopie flavored lollypop.     Dodgeball movie review final score: 10/10  &nbsp;

       The more technology, software, and gadgets that I see in the world, the more I realize that the powers creating technology must think that the number one plague facing society is that we don't have enough slide shows.  I mean seriously, have you ever stopped to think about how many things we have that make slide shows?  The original slide show was, of course, a legitimate slide show.  You took photographs and turned them into slides.  You took these slides, put them into a slide projector, projected them onto a screen, and told a story as you clicked through the slides of your slide show.  We were happy with this for decades.  Then came the personal computer.  Then came PowerPoint.  And you know what?  PowerPoint is a terrific program that allows you to easily create slides and show them on a screen automatically.  PowerPoint was technology's first major take on the slide show.  Microsoft did, and continues to do, a great job with this program.  It serves a great purpose and it's very useful.  But apparently PowerPoint wasn't enough.  We needed more slide shows.  In addition to PowerPoint, Microsoft has created tons of other slide show utilities throughout the years:     Additional versions of PowerPoint   Screensaver slide shows   Slide shows in XBox music maker   Slide shows in MSN emails   Slide shows in the MSN sidebar   MSN Photos slide shows   Windows Media Center PC slide show   MSN TV slide shows     And who knows what additional slide show technology Microsoft is working on right now to satisfy society's insatiable need for more slide shows.  But Microsoft isn't the only one responsible for more slide shows.  We also have an endless supply of programs that you can plug your digital camera into so that you can create slide shows anywhere and everywhere...on your cell phone, on your digital camera, on you TV, on a projector, and on your monitor.  Why?  Didn't we used to make fun of slide shows as what boring parents made their kids and neighbors watch after they got back from a long trip?  Why after being the butt of jokes for decades have slide shows now become one of the most prevalent things in technology?  Is this slide show push from the same people that resurrected the @ symbol from near extinction when they invented email?  I have to wonder.  So I must ask the powers that be: Why does society need so many slide shows?

       I am happy to say that last night I went to the best baseball game ever...or at least the best baseball game that I've ever been to. It was the Cleveland Indians playing the Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field in Seattle.  It all started when I was gifted free tickets to the game during work.&nbsp; I waited a little longer than normal to make it to the game.&nbsp; This ended up meaning that we missed all of the normal traffic and still made it to the game by the first inning.  After getting an amazing hot dog and some beer we made our way to the best seats we've ever had at a game. We were just a few rows back from first base. We only had to wait till the 3rd inning to see the Indians hit back-to-back-to-back home runs! That's the first time I've ever seen that happen at a game I was actually at.  Not only that, we also made it on the Jumbotron, came the closest we ever had to catching a fly ball, saw two guys get hit by pitches, and even got to witness a bench clearing incident. The Indians had such a great game that they set several franchise records over the course of the evening.  Go Tribe!

       I sure hope that marriage is nothing like getting a marriage license, because we just did that tonight and it was one of the most impersonal things we've ever done.  We drove up to the crappiest strip mall you've ever seen in a random town outside Seattle and walked into a tiny office.  There were two other couples that got there about the same time as us, and as we walked in the woman behind the counter said, "I can do all three of you at the same time."  I don't know if that's quite the phrase I was expecting to hear as I took a step towards spending the rest of my life with one person.  It's just not the tone I was going for.  After filling out lots of paper work and getting chided for not filling it in correctly, we were blessed with the news that the actual license we fill out never gets sent back to us.  Nope, we never see it again.  Instead we get a decorative piece of paper that we can fill out ourselves whenever we want.  All this service for the low low price of just $54.  I sure hope marriage is a little friendlier than the license.

       We were talking tonight about animal shelters and how much we love dogs.  It dawned on me that I've heard of animal shelters for practically every type of animal around...except fish.  So I thought to myself, "why aren't there any animal shelters for fish?"  Is there no such thing as an abused or abandoned fish?  Do people just not care as much about fish as they do about dogs and cats?  Or, is it just that if a fish isn't doing so well then it pretty much always dies so any fish that would actually require a shelter probably wouldn't actually make it to the shelter.  I guess that's why you never hear of anyone driving down the road and finding an abandoned fish on the side of the road with no collar on.  You never hear, "I noticed the little fella lying there shivering in the cold and whimpering, so I picked him up and brought him in."  Nope, Flipper just never gets rescued the way Whiskers and Scampers do.

       So it's Friday night at 9pm, and Kenzie and I are just plain bored.  We left work just a little early to see a 5:10pm showing of Anchorman (which ruled by the way - possibly another post on that later).  It seemed like a good idea at the time, but at this point everything's closed, we're tired of watching TV, and it's too late to really start doing anything interesting.  What should we do?  Well, obviously blogging came to mind so here we are...

       I love to cook.  I love Italian food the most, and there are so many great Italian dishes to make.  I'm getting married in about a month from now, and one of the things that my fiance and I registered for was a Panini grill.  This thing is awesome.  We've experimented on the grill a little bit, and here's my favorite basic panini sandwich recipe so far:  - ciabatta bread (herbed if possible) - ham - buffalo mozzarella cheese - olive oil - salt - pepper  Preheat your panini grill to just below its highest setting.  Cut the ciabatta loaf into sandwich sized pieces, and then cut those pieces in half horizontally so that you have a top half and bottom half for your sandwich.  Brush both sides of each piece of bread with olive oil.  Sprinkle the inside of one of the pieces of bread lightly with a little bit of salt and pepper.  Assemble your sandwich with the amount of ham and cheese you desire, but make sure that the cheese is on the top.  Place the panini sandwich on the preheated panini grill and lower the top.  Push down just a bit to make sure there's good pressure on the sandwich.  Let the panini cook for 5-7 minutes or until the bread is crispy.  Take the panini off the grill and serve.  Be careful since the panini will be hot.  Enjoy!   Don't have the tools for a panini?  Look here...         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

       This is my very first blog posting, so I thought I'd start with a broad question and see what kinds of responses I can garner.  So here's a question for all of you out there: how is blogging different than creating your own website?  I've read a lot of articles and posts about famous bloggers or famous blogs, but how is this any different than if those people had just created their own websites and updated them every day with new pages?  Is it just the fact that people can respond and reply to articles and posts?  Is it because a blog is free?  And, how does the Wiki world play into all of this?  Is Wiki simply a blog without state that anyone can keep editing over and over?  Is there any way to combine the two technologies?  What do you think?  Why blog instead of creating your own website?
