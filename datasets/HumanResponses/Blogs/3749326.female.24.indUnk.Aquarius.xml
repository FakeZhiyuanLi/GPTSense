						   For no other reason than not having to answer to anyone, the weekends are great.  I love spending time with my dog and lately I have been taking loads of pics of him because we got him groomed and he is so damn cute!  I have never felt so good about myself emotionally, however, I am sick of being fat!  And sick of being flabby and out of shape and sick of hiding my "flaws" and sick of going shopping and feeling like crap.  So, I HAVE TO WORK OUT.  I loved it last summer.  It was my release after Jo and I broke up and I looked and felt a lot better plus, I looked hot in cute little dress (and when I mean little I mean a size 12 dress).  I just want to be a size 9/10.  That's all!  I know that's two dress sizes down but I know I can do it if I work hard and watch what I eat.  So, I am going to eat salads for lunch everyday and have a nice healthy dinner.  (chicken and veggies)  It's been tough eating right at night because I have started dating a new guy and he loves to go out (like I object) to eat at great places!  However, I have added tons of fuits and veggies into my diet and have picked up on the water intake.  ARG... Working out is KEY!  It's been a pretty quiet day.  (thankfully)  Mom's fathers day patio furniture was delivered and she got to swing on the porch swing, which was nice to watch. I didn't get to swing because I had lunch with Caitlin.  We both are living back at home with our moms and we needed to vent.  She is the only one who understands my situation right now.  We are going to Greeley tomorrow with some of our girlfriends to the Rascal Flatts show and to the Rodeo.  Very excited about that.  And it will get us out of the house.  I am lucky though, cause mom has a BF and spends the night at his place 2-3 times a week.    Today it stormed.  It's been so rainy and stormy here this month.  I love it.  We need it too.  Kennedy gets so freaked out.  Today he even jumped into my lap.  HE NEVER DOES THAT.  I had mom take a picture of it and now it's my wallpaper on my computer.    Random thought of the day:  I can't even tell you how many marriage proposals I get after telling a guy (hockey fan) that I have season tickets!   I can't even tell you how far I am from the thought of marriage.  I knew Jo and I weren't going to get married probably by the end of year one.  We weren't meant to be and he needed to experience life outside of Colorado and the US.  He is fulfilling his dream and sounds like he has finally found his place in life.  I read the emails he sends to his friends and family (I get them from his friends Eddy and Carla) and he sounds like another person.  No one I have ever known.  Jenny asked me a few weeks ago if I missed him.  I told her that I didn't miss the old Jo and the new Jo is someone I have never known.  Carla said that Jo might want to hear from me, but I think that I probably caused him too much pain with the breakup.  I am sure he just wants to move on.  It really was such a painful time and I have never been so depressed in my life.  We were just so different.  I am such a goodie-goodie and Jo broke a few of my life rules.  I am not even sure why we stayed together.  We just were raised differently and grew up in very different neighborhoods.  However, I loved his family.  It was huge and they always were so nice to me.  I do miss that.  A lot.  But sometimes love isn't enough and a great family isn't enough.    I thought for sure I would accept some of his habits and mature, but I didn't... and in the end, the habits and my immaturity got in way.  Plus, he wasn't ready to settle down and all I have ever wanted was to be married.  It's actually almost been a year since we split.  I haven't seen him since, either.  We almost met up, but I kept putting it off because I didn't want to complicate things.  It's for the best.  His friends, Eddy and Carla are having a house warming party next weekend.  They invited me, but I am not sure I want to go.  It's still pretty painful and the last time I saw one of his friends, things didn't go very well.  Jo found out that I ran into one of his friends and he went nuts and called me on my birthday and bitch/cussed me out for conversing with his friend.  That was the last time Jo and spoke to each other.  It didn't end on a good note and that's part of the reason I don't really want to email him.  Everyone knows how I am.  I always say that it is easier to be mean to me that it is to be nice when ending something.  Like when my Dad passed away, everyone would come up to me and say things like, we love you or other nice things and that would make me cry.  My mom and I always say, just be mean, cause we hate being sad.  I know Jo and I were mean to eachother and I can deal with that.   Mean doesn't stick around like sad does .    Weird, cause when Jo and I broke up, it was on the anniversary of my father's death.  Hmmm guess the mean cancels out the sad.  Huh, weird.    I don't really know why I am writing so much about him.  I guess I have been thinking about him a lot lately because it's been a year.  But maybe it's because I get these periodic emails he sends to his friends and family and wonder who the hell he is now.  I mean his emails are so different from the man I know.  I wonder if it is a front his is putting on so that his family thinks he is okay.  Who knows.  It's been 2 years since we went to Europe together.  I loved/hated traveling with him.  I wonder what it would be like to travel with him now.  Now that he is off pot?  Alright, I have to go downstairs now and enjoy this quiet house.  I am going to read and sleep!  Elvis has left the building!

						   So, it's a Friday, TGIF, and I am home tonight (with my mom) LAME, playing my guitar.  Yes, that's right folks, I am learning to play the guitar and let me just say, it hurts!  I suck BAD but am having fun making up stupid lyrics to the key of G.  Man, I thought I had some kind of musical talent, but HELL NO.  I SUCK ROCKS!  And seriously, my finger tips are numb and I have found out that I have arthritis in my right elbow.  Who knew?    My plans for this weekend: Sleep a lot Swing on new porch swing I bought for mom on Fathers Day Read a girlie novel Listen to great country music Go to Stinky Greeley for the Independence Stampede to watch Rascal Flatts Speak more clearly so my mother will stop saying 'WHAT?!' Watch the lightning show from my bed under my covers Exercise, like ride a bike or something Say Yee Haw more than once on Sunday Have a breather from a new situation that has become overwhelming and exciting all at the same time.   Rekindle my love affair with music.  I lost my passion with music while in a draining relationship.  I did find a song that completely states my thoughts on being boy crazy: Shedaisy  "360Â° Of You"  I wish you lived on the corner where I live So I could look at you all the day long Lickety lip got me flippin' my lid, yeah Nibblin' my thumb 'cause I want me some Oooo, Oooo, Oooo just a little bit a Oooo, Oooo, Oooo Am I makin' you uncomfortable?  And if you lived on the corner where I lived I'd hang around like an apple in a tree Borrow some bread, stick of butter, cup of milk And some sugar for me I'm cookin' something sweet Oooo, Oooo, Oooo just a little bit a Oooo, Oooo, Oooo  [Chorus:] Lookin' once, lookin' twice Better get me a bucket of ice Go on do whatever you do I'll just sit here enjoyin' the view Whistlin' Dixie 360 degrees of you - Oooo, Oooo  I picture me twisted up in your t-shirt Pink lemondade and a squeaky porch swing Don't know your name yet, I guess it wouldn't hurt  If you gave me a ring - a big diamond ring  Oooo, Oooo, Oooo well a girl can dream Oooo, Oooo, Oooo  [Repeat Chorus]  [Second Chorus:] Lookin' once lookin' twice Your a splash of Tabasco on hot apple pie Baby girls like it too Like to sit around enjoying the view Whistlin' Dixie, 360 Whistlin' Dixe, 360 degrees of you, Oooo, Oooo  Just a little bit of you, Oooo, Oooo Gotsa, gotsa have you, Oooo, Oooo Just a little bit of you, Oooo, Oooo Oh, I'm gonna have you  Can't you just see me singing this little diddy???!?!   Random Question of the Day?  Scott:  Have I ever fallen asleep around you? EMPlanner:  Pardon?  Time for my book:  Babyville by Jane Green.  So far, great book!  Schmooch!

						   I just got my review back from my boss.  ARG!  I have love/hate feelings about annual reviews.  That whole week before the review, I get all nervous and jerky and then the day of the review I have a breakdown.  In this year's case, I cried.  Yep, I cried.  Very nice Erin, cry away and make everyone else feel like crap.  ARG!  I was told a few people in the department have 'complained' about how I don't work 80 hours every two weeks.  Nice.  It's a non-profit, no one works 80 solid hours every two weeks.  If you don't give me enough work, I just sit in front of my computer and surf the net.  So, I started working 90 hours every 2 weeks and I noticed how many people don't even work their own damn 80 hours.  Oh well, I am the new girl and need to buck up and strap on the 90 hours in pride.  Oh and by the way, everyone needs to mind their own business!  Oh and I am coming in late on Monday cause I am going to be at a concert late Sunday night and am going to feel hung over!  Oh and yah, the 19th of July I am taking off the WHOLE day to mourn the loss of my dad... It's been 10 years, ya know... so everyone can kiss it if they have a problem.  I don't get paid enough to feel this shitty about 80 hours.   Plus, If you were to calculate the actual time I spend driving to GAHSAW, my hours would be well over!  I mean I spend over 2 hours a day in my car to come here... so 2.5 hours a day x 10 times every 2 weeks =25 hours of driving time every two weeks.  I work over 9 hour days so... let's do the math and we all know I hate math... hmmm... 9 hours a day x 10 days every two weeks = 90 hours not including my 25 hours of driving... so really I think, breathe, eat, drink, GAHSAW 115 hours every two weeks!  AGAIN, KISS IT!  If they accounted for all of my 'work hours' I would be making over 40 a year!  YIKES!!!  I am getting screwed!!!!  If I wanted to go further I could charge for gas!  500 miles of driving to and from Boulder every week... $23 per gas up x filling up 2.5 times a week is $57.50 x 52 weeks is  $2990 .  Let the numbers speak!  Holy crap, that was a good rant...   Back to work!  EMPlanner

						   Well,  It's my first time to blog and to tell you the truth, I am really excited about it!  I have always wanted an online journal for everyone to view.  I dated this one guy who all he ever wanted to do is read my diary.  I was always so afraid he was going to find it and read all of my dirty little secrets, but thankfully I broke up with him before he found it.  So, I might just contact him and tell him that I have an online diary and that if he wants, he can read it and find out how very exciting my life really is.  :0)  It's Friday and our water has been turned off here at GAHSAW.  So we have to go across the street to the mortuary to use the bathroom... Talk about creepy.  It makes me laugh though.  I walked in there today and a friendly man who looked like a cherub asked so politely, 'Can I help you miss?  I answered, yes, bathroom please!  He smiled and looked at me doing the 'I just had 3 cups of coffee dance' and pointed me down the hall.  The mortuary music guided me down the hall with a smirk.  I have been in these types of places so many times, I feel like I even know the song that is being played.  How sick is that?!?    Alright, I need to actually do some kind of work today, so I must go...  Until later,  Peace out girl scout!  EMPlanner

						   Weird week at work this past week.  Been so busy, I can hardly blink.  I am feeling a bit overwhelmed and my mood has shown it at home.  After coming into work on Wednesday feeling tired, overwhelmed and moody, one of my co-workers asked what was wrong and I told him I just needed a vaca.  He then said, take one and take PTO time and then proceeded to ask how much PTO time I had.  Mind you, this is ths shit that ratted my ass out to my boss about my hours at work.  I then told (Let's call him WOXC) my hours and he then proceeded to say, 'well, you really don't have that much time saved up because this next week is the 4th of July and they take PTO time out of that.  Not kidding, 10 minutes later WOXC comes into my office and says, 'well, I have decided to take off today and tomorrow, don't be mad.  FUCK YOU.  I just opened up to you and told you I just needed some time off and you come in and rub THAT in my face.  ASS.  So, I continued to work until 6:15 (alone), and get my shit done.    I did screw up a major project this week so it wasn't WOXC's complete fault.  But let's blame him anyway!  :-)  Like I always say, the first step is admitting it and the second step is blaming someone for it! Anyway, the project I ARFED up made me look like a complete fool.  I seriolusly doubt myself and my abilities.  However, I have to just get over it and move on.  So, every night this week, I went out and didn't come home until after 11.  I am so tired!  Found out that one of GASAW's dearest workers passed away this week.  Very sad week for everyone there.  People were sad and it was difficult to work because of all the sadness.  He was our groundskeeper and maintanance guy.  So sweet and too young to die like that.  He's in my thoughts and prayers.  Also found out that my bestfriend is moving to Montana.  All I have to say about that is YEE HAW!  Now, she'll only be 8 hours from me.  Not bad.  And good thing is, is that she gets to bring Erik with her.  A lot of good things are happening for her right now.  However, a little concerned about the move on Erik.  He hasn't really had a big move like that and it is hicksville.  Not sure all that country music and cowpoke shit will be that easy to get used to.  Expecially for a guy who gets to go to a major sporting game.  They will now have to drive 8 hours to do so!  That's right Erik and Jenny, the Avs, Rockies, and Broncos are now your 'hometown' sports teams!  YEE HAW!  I'm pulling for you E-POK.  If you need the 'big city', come on down to D-town, and I'll take care of you!  Went downtown last night with so friends.  BFF Caitlin, lil sis Sarah, her hot boyfriend Adam, his big bro Nordys cafe guy (can't remember his name) and his wife Nicole, my coptoys Robbie and John.  Fun Fun night.  Danced all night long and took a bunch of pictures.  Went to IHOP and didn't get home until 4 this morning.  NICE!  I wore a booby top and great jeans.  Not sure why I mentioned that but I felt like a modern day Jackie O.  My dad would have been proud, minus the boob fest.  Oh well, I got em, might as well flaunt them before they sag to the groud.  Been having fun being quasi-single.  Been dating this new guy who is pretty serious about me. A little freaked out because I like going to clubs and having a good time, and I don't want to answer to anyone but myeself.  I am not going to think about it too much.  This Girl Just Wants To Have Fun.    Today is kind of a scary day.  Going to a housewarming party today up in Thornton.  It's for some friends of Siahjo's.  It was a year ago today that I had my bell's palsy.  Just a weird reminder of how unhappy I was.  I know that I am going to see his friends and explain my life to them.  Not really sure how ready I am for that.  I love this couple though.  Great people who have always pulled for me.  Actually Carla is the one who sends me the emails that Jo writes his friends and family.  She is so nice to me.  I completely miss her and Eddie.  They always made me laugh.  Mom and Don made it to Houston.  Guess they both got stung by wasps.  The wasp that stung Don flew into his shirt and stung him a bunch of times.  Weird.   I am off to do some laundry, hydrate myself, feed the dog, fight off the hoards of men standing at my door to see my lovely, makeup smeared face and smokey hair smellin self!  I'm hot.  Peace out  PS, someone, anyone needs to post here.  I think I am talking to space.

						    urlLink Randomly Organized Thoughts  Friday, July 09, 2004   This is from mytrafficnews.com.  My mom and I thought it was Hee-Haw-Highlarious!  Enjoy... Gobble Gobble     Friday:      The best way to spend the last few minutes (or hours) of a holiday-shortened week, we think, is to goof off. Hey, goof off with us, as we take a jaunt through what's going on that might tie up traffic tonight. Get comfy; there's a lot going on.  First, there's the 12th Annual LoDo Music Festival, blocking off 20th through 22nd Streets from Blake to Larimer next to Coors Field today and tomorrow. Today's music starts at 5 p.m., and the official site warns against bringing such things as cans, fireworks and turkey legs. You heard them, people, NO TURKEY LEGS!  C-470 and Morrison Road could be packed during the rush hour because of a 5:30 p.m. show at Red Rocks with The Allman Brothers Band and String Cheese Incident. By the way, both are "jam bands" which means this concert will probably be about 9 songs and 47 drum solos in only 7 or 8 hours. Whoo! Turkey legs are OK, but only from free range turkeys.  Meanwhile, the Amphitheater on Fiddler's Green Parkway will host the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, as they play the music of Led Zeppelin starting at 7 p.m. If the Internet is to be believed, this really is happening. Next week a banjo and bagpipe band play the music of Ice-T. OK. We made that one up, but it seems about as likely. Cornish Game Hen legs are OK, but no turkey legs. Sorry.  But wait, there's more! The Pepsi Center not only has Cirque de Soleil in the parking lot at 4 and 8 p.m., but Women of Faith are in the Can itself, starting at 7 p.m. Don't expect all the typical swearing as attendees scramble for the last parking space that will actually fit an SUV. But watch for a lot of grit teeth and a growl of "I'm going to PRAY for you SO DARN HARD!" Whole turkeys -- if very, very flexible -- are allowed at the cirque, and for the faith event, well, you can bring whatever food you want as long as you promise to send us the recipe and it's OK if you used Miracle Whip because we can't cook without it either.  Most of these events repeat tomorrow, with one addition: John "I'm a turkey leg at heart" Fogerty plays tomorrow at Universal Lending Pavilion. We mentioned this yesterday, and a MyTrafficNews family member wrote in and thought our "secret code" was another lame joke. It's not! Click the link below and enter the secret code COACHF in the Special Promotions window; you can get one or two tickets for only the service charges.  Another reader wrote in and said that Fogerty is great, but he's excited to see the other act on the bill: Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers. "Nothing like songs about tequila," he writes, "and, well, more tequila!" Except maybe a Turkey Leg ballad.  We're excited about the show, and we're not sure what the rules say, but we're bringing turkey legs. They can have our turkey legs when they pry them from our cold, wrinkled up hands! And even then we'll keep all that yummy seasoning and the juices that drip on our hand! So there!  If you have a fear of crowds, hide in your closet and eat turkey legs until the weekend is over. Otherwise, get out and have some fun; there's plenty to be had. We'll either see you Saturday night at the Fogerty show, or right here Monday afternoon. Until then, thanks for reading!

						   to say that you're a friend of mine is quite the declaration. i've only known you several years from many celebrations.  you've been a costly friend at times when i didn't have the money. you helped me laugh at things i wouldn't normally take as funny.  you helped me dance, and shout, and flirt with boys i never knew, and helped me think i look a lot more attractive than i do.  you helped me fall a time or two on concrete that was dirty, but saved me from embarrassment  when i acted way too nerdy.  you help to keep late-night diners open with full menus, and taco bell and wendy's have  become our favorite venues.  you also helped to make me sick too many times to count; you never really helped me  in consuming the correct amount.  my favorite part of all the nights you filled with drunken laughter was how you stuck around and raged all through the morning after.  you made me late to many jobs-- especially to school, though i knew that bosses and professors didn't think that was cool.  you care about our needs  and never bitch about your own, especially when we're lonely-- we know we're not alone...  you've got a job that no one envies, and we heartily give you praise for enhancing many many nights, and many many days.  who'da thought i'd find a friend in something like a drink? i can safely say i know for sure that you're my friend...i think.

						   So being selfish has it's benefits obviously.  My whole life theme right now is that I don't want to date anyone seriously and that I want to concentrate on learning more about myself and pretty much live my life like it's all about me, all the time.  I have been pretty successful at being selfish, as I am an only child, and I know how not to share. Even as an animal lover, my thoughts of owning a pet when I move into my new house, makes me ill!  I mean, I can't have an animal who will shit on my new $6,000 carpet!!!   As of late, my life theme has gone down the shitter.  I have/am completely been lustful lately, which is nice, but it's blurring the the line and I have now created this grey area which is ARG! I am trying not to be completely engulfed by my lust and function at work as if I am not falling for someone.  However, it's tough not to think about being in lust when the lustful object comes to Boulder just to take me to lunch.  YIKES!  Oh but how dreamy it is to be taken care of... but wait, I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!  Oh but it's nice to have a day off and have someone else take care of you.  WAKE UP!  LUST IS DISTRATING, especially when the lustful object of my affection is hot!    Funny how my selfishness attracts some and repels others.  For example, I had several requests for hot dates the past few months, but most of my female friends can't even stand me right now.  Except Caitlin.  We are on the same track right now.  We are content with where we are in life, doing our own thing, being strong women, loving the attention we receive from men, but love and would prefer hanging out rather than having to answer to someone/anyone.  And we know, in the end, we will turn out the "better wives" because we took the chance to be selfish now, rather than later.  I mean, who wants a women who wasn't selfish in her 20's and is now wanting to be selfish with 2 kids!?!  NO ONE!  DAMN, I'm SMART!    Speaking of selfish, go to www.feelmypain.net.  This guy is selfish which in turn, makes a neighborhood insane and everyone then turns on him.  Even the kids.  This guy has a lot of time on his hands and really needs to get laid, get out more and realize that if you move to Highlands Ranch, children are expected.  I mean, Douglas County is the fastest growing county in the USA.  DUH! Plus, it's Highlands Ranch, track housing is what HR does.  Random:  I went to the Toad.  A cool little quasi dive bar in Littleton.  I had a blast. Live music, cheap drinks.  I went with the new guy, we'll call him Lustin, and his exgirlfriend, yes that's right, his ex who is also my good friend and my old roommate and her boyfriend.  Actually, I love this girl (the ex).  She is positively the sweetest girl I know.  Her boyfriend is lucky to have her!  The whole thing with Lustin and the Ex is kind of a sticky situation!  They ended on a bad note but have recently become friends ago.  We had fun, once we drank.  :-)  Can you tell the Boss and most of my other coworkers are gone today?  I can!  Enjoying the view from my office.  I love wandering off into the wild world of the internet.    The Avalanche have a new coach.  Jo Quinnville.  Good stuff.  Guess we will see his coaching ability in 2005.  ARG.  If the NHL won't play, I will go to the DU games.  YEP.    Mom was in a rotten mood last night.  I can't see why?  I cleaned her house and the bathroom and did laundry.  I think she misses Don.  BARF.  He will be back in a few days.    Okay, need to work...

						    urlLink Randomly Organized Thoughts   I haven't blogged in so long!  The reason for my absence, is that I have been SLAMMED at work!  All I do is sit on the computer and answer emails/phone calls all day.  So, the last thing on my mind is to jump on the computer at home and write.  ARG!  Speaking of being busy at work, I just wrote a long email to one of my old roommates and now the letter is stuck in send mode... IT WON'T CLOSE!  And so, now, I am forced to BLOG.    Let me just say that I am so glad that it is HUMP DAY!  What a great day to be humped!    I am leaving in one hour to go to a Martini Making Party in Downtown Denver.  I can't wait.  I love leaving work early for a good cause, like getting sloshed at a bar.  Yesterday I left early for a pedicure.  My feet were actually distracting my work.  I had to leave early to regain my focus!  Plus, my boss is out sick and well, it's easier to leave early when she is gone!  FYI:  I shaved my legs today.  Yes that's right, the day after I had a pedicure.  Yes, the little woman prettying my feet had to deal with my hairy legs!  HA SUCKER!  I gave her a $10 tip.  She deserved it.    Last night I went to bed at 10:35 and I wasn't even sick.  I usually only go to bed that early when I am sick.  But I guess I was just that tired.  Justin called at 11:30 and I must have sounded drunk.  I was so out of it.  I wonder what I said to him.  Let's hope to God those 3 little words didn't slip!  Yah know, Let's Do It.  :-)  Found out last week that my best friend is moving closer to home.  She got a job in Billings which is only 7 hours from my new house in E-town.  So, I guess that's better than Milwaukee.  Closer at least.    Getting my chop cut hair done this week.  Thank the dear lord for that.  I look like a bowl headed freak.  Actually, I look like a jellyfish.  I'm hot.  Lucky Justin.  Well, I need to get ready to leave early!  HA  As my friend Rob says, I love you like a fat kid loves twinkies.    Keep reading and for god's sake, someone please post!  EMPshizzle

						   Bunny Survives Explosives Ordeal  (AP) Lucky the bunny is living up to her name. It had seemed like luck had run out: Strapped to a powerful explosive with a lit fuse, Lucky was tossed into a lake.   But the explosive didn't blow up, and the rabbit was pulled out of the water.   Now Lucky's owner and his friend face misdemeanor charges of animal cruelty after photos of the July 13 incident surfaced on the Internet.   Nick Sigmon, 18, and Paul Collins, 20, are accused of taping an illegal M-1000 -- a large firecracker equivalent to a quarter stick of dynamite -- to the rabbit and throwing her into Lake Don Castro.   Sigmon said he fished Lucky out of the water to save her from drowning. But prosecutors charged the two lifeguards on Wednesday. Two other men who were present during the incident may also face charges.   'I think that a lot of people are judging us without knowing us at all,' Sigmon said. Asked why he fitted Lucky with the explosive, he said, 'Um, that's a real tough question to answer.'   Sigmon said he adopted the bunny after almost running over her with his car, but can no longer care for her because he's starting college this fall at University of California, San Diego, where he plans to study biology.   Someone found the photos on the personal Web site of one of the suspects and posted them on Craigslist, the popular Internet bulletin board, where the House Rabbit Society in Richmond saw it.   Lucky is recovering at a foster owner's home, where she's snacking on hay pellets and doing well."

						      It's been interesting living at home with mom and having a social life at the same time.  Not that it's been a bad thing, just interesting.  I hate coming home late and fearing that I will wake her.  I did that once and regretted it the next day.  She woke up and couldn't get back to bed and I felt the heat from the flames shoot from her eyes, ears and nose.  She was pissed.  And bringing a date over, yah, not going to happen!  Too much shit in the house, too many furry animals (don't get my wrong, I love Ken but you know how furry he is and he farts sometimes).  Not really attractive.  Doesn't really allow a mood to be set.  Well it actually does set a mood;  Get the hell out of this stinky, cluttered home!    I am building a house and CAN NOT wait to move.  Not to get away from mom, but to get back into my own space.  I just do things differently when living at home, alone.  Plus, it's new and clean, and I can't wait to decorate and lay on the kitchen floor.  Mary and I used to do that.  Our parents used to hate it.  Funny.  My new house is so awesome, they are drywalling today and next week.  It's coming along so well.  I love watching the progress.  I can honestly say that my house is what I am in love with right now.  Nothing else.  I have been collecting things here and there to add to my home.  A nook table and chairs, a bakers rack (like I bake).  I am going for "rod iron" Parisian feel.  Duh!  I need new bedroom furniture.  I want dark wood in my bedroom, to make it inviting and warm!  :-)  Actually, I want a king sized bed.  More room to not share.  I'm not kidding... I am the kind of girl who likes to snuggle until I'm about asleep... And then it's like get on your side and stay there.  No touching and if you breathe on me, I will most likely puke.  Attractive, I know.  My house will be organized and spotless, I won't have that much stuff to fill the house, finally, my cluttered apartment life will look less cluttered in this big home.    It's only 2:26pm and I have a long ways to go until I leave for work.  I have to clean my office because we have a few committee members coming here tomorrow for a meeting.  Boring stuff, I know... Glad I don't have to be here for it.   Randomly Organized Thoughts:      What I Would Like To Accomplish This Weekend      Get drunk without yacking    Makeout with JD (hey, a girl's got needs too)    Dance like nobody's watching    Volunteer at the Boulder County Fair at the Salsa Competition    Look at Cowboys and flirt with them.    Take a nap    De-fur Kennedy    Clean my room/bathroom  ARG    Not think about work    Listen to some great music    Swing on the porch swing    Finish book, start another    Figure out my new hairstyle    Tan again, but not burn my ass or boobs... HA     Okay, I need to really get to work... And begin my weekend and finish up my day.      PEACE

						    urlLink TheDenverChannel.com - News - Bear Enters Woman's Tent, Rolls Her Around : "Bear Enters Woman's Tent, Rolls Her Around  Snowmass Village Woman Escapes With Minor Injuries  Bear hunters are tracking a large black bear near Snowmass Village, Colo., after it crashed into the tent of a local woman and rolled her around, the Aspen Daily News reported Wednesday. The hunters will kill the bear if they are able to track it, according to the Colorado Division of Wildlife. 'This bear, because it did injure a person, if we are able to track it down, it will be destroyed in accordance with (Division of Wildlife) policy,' Todd Malmsbury of the DOW told the Daily News. Emily Casebeer, 19, said she was sleeping alone in a tent at the Snowmass Creek trailhead Sunday when the bear entered her tent and started rolling her around. She was not seriously injured and quickly made her way to her vehicle and drove home. A subsequent examination revealed a small wound on her leg and some bruising. When she returned to her tent, it had been destroyed. Malmsbury said the encounter it is the first incident of its kind in Colorado this year. Casebeer did not appear to have any food in her tent at the time of the incident, according to Malmsbury. He said there are 10,000 to 12,000 black bears in Colorado at the current time.

Stephan Ballasch, 35, of Wray, and Shawn Madsen, 36, of Ramah, bought two pairs of women's thong underwear at Wal-Mart, went into the bathroom, and put them on Tuesday. They strolled out wearing only T-shirts and the undergarments and made it to their cars before Scottsbluff police caught them, police said. Police reviewed surveillance tape before arresting the duo. When asked why they were in women's thongs and T-shirts, one of the men said because one their friends 'triple-dog dared' them to. A phone number listed for Ballasch was disconnected.

						    urlLink Randomly Organized Thoughts   Welp, he did it.  Hot Pants Lance Armstrong has won for the sixth time.  He has cycled through France for twenty something days and right into the history books.  YUM.  So lean, so angular.  Dreamy really and he's dating a rock star and older hottie Sheryl Crow.  If I knew how to post pictures on here I would post the one where he is holding up 6 fingers.  What he is really saying in that photo is "Hi Erin (left hand), you're number 1 (right hand)."  Yes, Lance, come to Mommy.  :-)  I am a pervert and am fine with being a perv.  Went to a Martini making party last Wednesday.  It was fun!  Got to hang out with my girlfriends.  Two of which had HUGE announcements.  Lisa, school friend and host, announced her new job!  And Raquel, school friend and super hip girl, announced her engagement to Lawrence!  However, the most shocking part of the announcement is that they are getting married in less than two weeks!  Congrats to everyone with announcements!    My best friend in Colorado is no longer speaking to me.  Long story short, I believe in a woman's right to choose.  She does not.  And I guess that is a problem.  However, she has always known my opinion and now that a person of common interest has come to us with a potential problem, it has really driven a wedge between our friendship.  I respect her opinion, but not her judgmental ways.  It's not her choice.  And in the end there is only one being that can judge and it's certainly not my best friend.  GOD BLESS THE USA AND THE FREEDOM THAT COMES WITH LIVING HERE!  I've seen a nasty side of myself for the first time in a long time.  I saw the jealous side of me creep out this past week.  My new lust(let's call him JD) is out of town this week training for his future endeavors to Antarctica.  He is having way too much fun and hanging out with pretty girls who think he's cute.  He made the STUPID mistake by telling me (when he was lit) that he kissed a girl.  Oh hell no!  Don't tell me that.  People keep telling me, "well, at least he was honest."  HONEST!  Well, now I am completely self conscience!!!  ARG!  And then he told me that he just kissed her on the cheek.  Okay, so that's okay, but it puts the fear of God into my head.  I mean, this was just a week long trip, what's going to happen when he is gone for 5 months!?!  I am not sure I can handle it.  Am I nuts for getting this worked up over a kiss on the cheek?  I would love feedback.    I made another big change this weekend.  I cut my hair off!  It's very cute.  I am still trying to figure out how to do it, but I love the cut.  I colored it too... Mahogany.  It's purty.    OH!  I would like to thank Brenda and Dave for driving my drunk, jealous ass home on Saturday night.  Those damn Red Bull Vodka's really kick my ass.  I love it!  Plus, nothing like a little dancing to get me all out of control.  And the guy with the pitched tent jamming into me while we danced made me laugh and throw up in my mouth at the same time.  Good times in LoDo!    My friend Rob and I always say (as we are driving to LoDo) "I love downtown.  It's just the best."  We sound so cheesy, but it's true.  I honestly love downtown.  I always get so defensive when people make bad comments about Colorado.  It's the best state in America.    Okay, I need to work.  I am out!    BLOG THIS!

						   So, my best friend from high school is getting married next Friday. Yes, the date of her wedding is Friday the 13th. Uh huh. In high school we would sit around and dream about what our weddings would be like. Who would be in our bridal party. And who would be maid of honor. She was the first of us to get engaged. She picked her wedding party leaving a few of us out. Mainly me. I know she has a large family and her sisters are in the bridal party along with her college friend. We went and paid for trips to Vegas to celebrate the nups, offer support and hopefully be included in the planning process. Nope, left out. Helped gather the music from our old high school choir teacher. Not a huge task, but it took time out of my day to help. Not a problem, because I like to help and figured it would come back to me. Then a few weeks ago, I found out the our other best friend from high school/college was asked to read at the wedding. Ouch. I immediately went into FUCK YOU mode. Pissed off and hurt. Initially I didn't like her husband to be. I thought he was rude and pompous. But at a wedding we all attended a few years ago, he came up to me and apologized for past doings. I was shocked, surprised and completely flattered that he actually cared. I then let things go and began to see the reason why my friend fell in love with him. He puts her on this pedestal and just adores her. Anyone can see that. So, knowing that, I am going to stop having a pitty party and take me not being invited to be a part of the wedding as a hint that it's not about me. Her wedding has nothing to do with me. Which I always thought it would. But in the end, it's just about her and her fiance. And if I hear one more person say the reason I wasn't allowed to bring a guest is because they want me to "rekindle" the "flame" between me and her brother, shit will hit the fan and I will get so drunk, I will puke everywhere. Who cares! SERIOUSLY, SHUT UP!  So, the only other person who reads this blog is sgl steve1. At first I thought, how funny, SINGLE STEVE reads my blog. Weird, how did he find it? He tried chattin me up and everytime he would IM me I would laugh cause Single Steve was trying to chat with me. Why? I didn't know, but what I did know is that I was flattered that someone/anyone would contact me because of this web log. And then I thought, how weird that someone is contacting me because of this Blog. I am crazy and who wants to contact a crazy person?!? Well, I guess Steve did and we continue to IM while at work. I recently found out that his screen name SGL Steve1 doesn't mean Single Steve. However, I don't believe him. :-) And will continue to believe that SGL Steve means what it looks like. I sent him a pic of me and I think I have completely distracted him with my self portrait! LOL Yah, I don't think so. Again, I am a crazy lady.  I am trying to get my friends to start up Blogging. I think it's a great way to relieve stress, take your mind off of things at work, procrastinate, bitch and moan. Thanks Mandy for introducing me to the wonderful world of blogging. Now, I just need to figure out how to load pictures. Anyone want to help me with that?  I am going to the Mountains this weekend to hang out with JD and my uncle. Plan on doing a lot of relaxing and going to the rodeo. I think we are going bowling tonight. Should be fun. It's my first sleep-over with JD at his place. Kinda freaked out. Not sure how this is going to work. So, I packed a huge bag of shit. Not really sure what to bring. Let's hope for a real bed and bed frame. Nothing like sleeping at your quasi-bf's house on a mattress on the floor. Screams bachelor to me. Yah, I know I am prissy. That's right. Who knows why JD would want to be with a girl like me. He is so outdoorsy. For fucks sake he is going to Antarctica to be a fireman for 5 months. That's awesome, but I would rather decorate my new house.  New dilemma:  Dated a guy for a few months earlier this year. Was completely crazy about him. Things were casual. We would see each other a few times a week, maybe. He is completely career minded and goal driven and always busy with work. It completely consumes his life which eventually became the death of us. It's not like we broke things off, we just faded out. Had called and emailed a bunch of times, he never returned any of them. Until last night. He called as I was tanning. Left a message. I, of course being very smitten with him, called him back. We chit chatted, and agreed to meet up sometime next week. ARG! Why now? He told me that he was most likely moving to Thornton. He then said he was moving up north to be closer to me! HA HA... Nice line. Oh who the hell knows what I am supposed to do!  I am off to think...  ARG!  HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!!!

						    Game 7-There I was, in the Lightning locker room, waiting to interview players during the locker room celebration. It was mayhem on the ice as Bolts players took turns posing for the picture that would go down as their all-time favorite: the Stanley Cup military press. Ten reps of 35 pounds won't build big deltoids, but they make the sweetest photo. AndreychukI was in the locker room with two other reporters, the benefit of working for a network rights holder. The next time the Stanley Cup is awarded, NBC will be the U.S. network airing the celebration, so this might have been the last time I'll ever be in that position. The room was empty. Then, in walks Lightning captain   urlLink  Dave Andreychuk   . He places the Stanley Cup in the middle of the locker room, then leaves. Maybe he had to pee or something. So the Cup is just sitting there in the middle of the room. No one else was there. Just the Cup. It was a very surreal moment. The Cup runneth over in an emptyeth roometh. Eventually, slowly, players made their way in.   urlLink  Brad Lukowich    put his little girl in the bowl, bringing tears to his wife's eyes. Eventually, Andreychuk came back, and I interviewed him for SportsCenter. He said, in so many words, that he had just played his last NHL game. To go out with a Cup like Ray Bourque did in 2001. Then we were sprayed with champagne, which ruined my $75 suit (I think it was   urlLink  Jassen Cullimore   ). The interviews were over, and the room was getting nightclub crowded. Before I left, I took off my suit jacket and had Lightning winger   urlLink  Chris Dingman    sign the back of my white shirt with a blue Sharpie while I was still wearing it. Dingman is a good friend of our boy   urlLink  Shjon Podein    , and he became a friend to me during the 17-day final series. My souvenir from the 2004 Cup final is a white dress shirt autographed by Chris Dingman. He wrote: "To John, Podes' bedfellow. Chris Dingman." Dingman PodeinPlease let me explain. Podes has good friends on both Calgary and Tampa Bay, so he decided to pay tribute in true Podes style. Before leaving Minnesota for Calgary for Game 3, he painted his entire body red, put "Yelle 11" on his back, and sported a red Jofa hockey helmet sans the padding. And made it through airport security. Let me clarify that: He spray-painted his entire body. Podes couldn't find body paint so he risked poisoning himself for the good of the team by emptying four cans of Krylon on his skin. Anyway, he flies on the plane painted red, walks around Calgary all day painted red, and goes to Game 3 ... painted red. Of course the best part for me is when I met him after the game for a nightcap; he was very easy to find. A hostess doesn't often hear, "I'm looking for the guy spray-painted red and wearing Hakan Loob's Jofa helmet." Pretty good chance you are the first guy to utter those words to her. Well, Podes needed a place to stay for the night and I said, "Stay with me." So, Podes comes back to the room and collapses from his long day in my bed. The only bed in the room. Now what? Well, the beds are Montana wide. You could comfortably fit Ken Hitchcock, Melrose and Mark Hunter in there without incident. So, I tuck myself in on the other side and call it a night. You could have laid four Stanley Cups between us. Really! Anyway, Podes left at 6 a.m. to catch a flight. I woke up around 8. As I pulled the curtains and let in the day's light, it looked like a homicide had occurred in my bed. Podes left a body outline of red paint on the sheets. I was sure the Calgary police would have me arrested and questioned by noon. I waited until the maid service arrived to explain the giant red blotch on the sheets, and I remained a free man. As an addendum to this story, Podes shows up in Tampa Bay painted entirely blue with "DINGMAN" on his back before Game 5. The story is basically the same as above. And now you know the Chris Dingman autographed dress shirt story. NHL Awards night

						   I hadn't heard from the White Truck Guy (WTG) since we had met for drinks, but then again, I didn't think he would call. I threw that experience over my shoulder and made it a memory. No big deal. Welp, he called me on my way home from work yesterday. He said hello and then almost immediately questioned me on my relationship status. I told him that I was dating someone, but that things are pretty open. He was kind of quiet and I then jumped into the same kind of questioning. Was he in a relationship? He said yes. And that's when I replied with: You're a bad boy!" Funny, sorta, but I meant it. I don't deal with people like that and plus, it's just a precursor as to what will come. Anyway, I asked how long this relationship had been going and he didn't say. Then I got even more smart and asked if he was married!?!? DUH! He of course answered yes. I am so damn naive!!! It never even entered my head that this guy would have been married. I mean married guys don't hang out their trucks yelling at girls driving in the mountains!!! YAH THEY DO! Why do I give people the benefit of the doubt? Why do I think that all people are good people? Not saying WTG is bad, but WTF? Who does that? He apologized for lying. I accepted. No big deal to me, as I just had a margarita with the guy, nothing more, nothing less. And he has 2 children, to boot! His oldest is 7! Shit, 7 years ago I was 17 and in high school and had just lost my virginity. It had never dawned on me that he was married. NEVER. SOMEONE NEEDS TO GIVE ME A SWIFT KICK IN THE ASS!!! Wake me up.

Guards were stunned to discover the man had glued his hand to that of his visiting girlfriend last week.   Media reports quoted Uwe Dieter Krone as saying, 'We've glued our hands together to call attention to my prison situation and to be heard.'   The couple had to be hospitalized.   'They will remain there until they can be separated and will then have to appear before a judge to make statements. They cannot appear in court together,' said Raquel Navarro, a spokeswoman for Spain's Penitentiary Institutions.   Navarro said she didn't know what type of glue was used.   Krone, 39, was being held in a Madrid prison pending possible extradition to Germany, where he is accused in a case involving the trafficking of prostitutes."

I am looking quite tan for this Irish white ass.  Well, I might not look that tan to you, but only certain people really know how tan I am.  :-)  Yah right!  After Tanning:  go home to play Bunco with neighborhood ladies.  Hell Yah, I could win $20 big ones.  Tuesday:  Attempt to come into work before 9am.  Dilly Dalley around the office, again.  Meet Carolyn (grade school friend) at porn shop.  We are there to shop for our other grade school friend's bacholerette party.  Plan on getting something sexy and slutty for her and for me.  :-)  PS... I need red shoes to go with my HOT black and white halter dress.  Must go shopping.  Wednesday: (actually my Friday) Again, attempt to come into work before 9am.  Head home a bit early to freshen up for the girly party.  Plan on drinking a few too many margs, just enough to make me fun, but not too many to make me want to dance on tables without a bra.  Thursday:  Sleep the fuck in.

Great event to schmooze with other industry folks.  I love being one of the youngest in the industry.  Makes me feel powerful and successful...  SURE?!?  Friday:  Big wedding day.  Sleep in.  Hopefully see JD before wedding.  Get hair done by Mom's stylist/boyfriend.  Nice that he is willing to do my hair!  Can't wait.  Get ready with Jenny?  I should call and ask her if she wants to get ready together just like we did in high school for most of our dances.  :0)  Awe the good old times.  I miss her more than you know.

It won't be pretty.  I always cry at weddings.  It doesn't matter whose wedding either.   I am such a hopeless romantic.  Don't tell anyone.  I wouldn't want the secret to get out that I am all mushy and soft.  Since we were little girls, the Bride to be and I used to dream about our weddings.  Mostly our receptions.  Mostly the music.  Because we are such dancers, we came up with a list of songs that are a must at our receptions.  Number one on the list is Dancing Queen by ABBA.  Oh HELL YAH!  Baby Got Back is a Favorite.  Joker is always good.  Sniff and I want the Boot Scootin Boogie to be played.  I CAN'T WAIT TO DANCE.  Reminder:  Bring Flippies to dance in... I know my feet are going to hurt.  PS:  Hopefully I won't kill a girl that is attending the wedding.  She's not my favorite and I am not hers.  Prepare to dim a few fires that could be/will be created at the reception.  Ex BF and GF's reunite for the first time since the break-up.  Yikes!  Saturday:  Sleep in.  Recover from hangover.  Head over to new bride and groom's parents house for BB-Q.  Head over to my lust's house for a BB-Q.  Meet all the people he will be living with on "The Ice".  Hopefully make out a bit with lust.  :-)  Sunday: I would like a day to myself.  Seriously, I need to hang out with myself and readjust my attitude.  Probably swing on the porch swing or take a drive to somewhere quite.

						   I left for the mountains straight from work on Friday around 5:30. I didn't make it to my final destination until after 8. Traffic SUCKED, bad! Most of my time was spent on this side of the divide. Thankfully I had good music. While sitting in traffic, I heard something outside yelling. I turn and look and to my surprise I find some guy hanging out his window waving to me. For sure I thought something was wrong, like a flat tire or something. But it was nothing of that nature. This guy is smiling and waving, and then yelling out his window to me telling me how "smokin" he thought I was. I giggled, blushed, and smiled back. However, we drove side by side for 4 hours. So, it was 4 hours of him and I trading smiles. He asked for my number, and I can't believe that I gave it to him. We chatted, he asked me if I knew any good jokes. He then asked if he could buy me a drink!?! WHAT, I was going up to the mountains to spend time with my new lust, and this guy in the white truck comes along. Why now? Feast or fuckin famine! It's rainin men, so I guess when it rains, it pours! I reluctantly agreed to a drink. We pulled off the side of the road to meet, and had a nice time. Turns out this White Truck Guy (WTG) works in Erie, right where I am buying my home. Kind of thrilling, exciting, flattering. I'm blushing right now. Giddy really. For many different reasons.  Had a great time in the mountains. After the marg with WTG, I went to my uncle G's house. We went down to this new posh bowling alley to have dinner. It was good actually. Not like the regular bowling alley food you might find down in the city. This place was fancy. 7+ plasma flat screens, rock and stone fireplaces, great bar and eatery. It was pretty. JD met up with us and invited a few of his friends. It was fun. I kicked major bowling ass beating JD in the second game. We then went home to JD's. Saturday I got up and went back to uncle G's and painted all day. G is gutting his house and I wanted to spend some time with him. It was great. We then went to the Eagle County Fair and Rodeo. It was awesome. Ever seen a guy ride horse bare back? It's so violent and insane. It looks like the horse and the cowboy are going to snap in half. Frickin fantastic. It amazes me that the horse and the cowboy make it out alive. I had such a fun time, screaming and yelling that I have lost my voice today. Love it. I sound all sultry and yummy. LOL. Sunday I was sat in front of all of JD's friends. JD said I needed to be "approved" by his friends. Not sure how I faired. Guess I will find out soon enough. I was more quiet than usual. I didn't want to step out of my comfort zone and make a complete ass of myself. All of his friends were really nice. I can tell they love JD a lot. They want to make sure he is happy. I really like his loyalty to his friends and family. It's a very attractive quality.  My boss is out again. Only 3 of us in the office today. It's nice. Very quiet.  It's taken me almost two hours to write this blog. Why? Who knows. Might as well publish this to get it off my desk. :-)

						   Holy Crap!  Never have I ever had so much fun.  My last week has been busy, crazy, hysterical, typical, a-typical, enjoyable, emotional, spiritual, and memorable.  Let me recap from last Wednesday.  Wednesday night:  The Matron of Honor threw the Bride a bacherorlette party.  All I have to say is everything mixes well with Sangria.  Especially porn.  :-)  I didn't throw up, however I should have.   Thursday:  Pick up Poot and Sniff and take them to my new home in E-town.  We then had girly things done to our feet and hands.  I dropped the girls off and headed back up north to Westminster where I went to a charity event for Meeting Planners.  I ended up winning a 2 night stay in Cheyenne, which to some people would suck, but I love cowboys, country music and the rodeo life.  It's perfect and I was so excited to have won it!  After the charity event, I received a phone call from my old roommate.  Her boyfriend was in the process of asking for her parents blessing to marry her.  Awe, how sweet!  Well, she called me in tears because her father did NOT give his blessing and said that Bren and Dave did not have his blessing to get married and that he would NOT pay for the wedding and that he didn't want to have another daughter supporting her husband.  Apparently, Bren's sister is helping pay for things while her husband goes back to school.  Okay, so big deal.  People do that all the time.  Her dad is such an ass.  I can't believe he did that to them.  She was devastated and ultimately had the fuck it mentality.  Dave and her are in love and are meant to be together.  Through medical school and all.  DAD'S CAN BE ASSES!  After that whole debacle,  I went to the bride's house and hung out with ALL of our old friends, cousins, frat boys, etc.  It was great.  I have never laughed so hard in my entire life.  It's been so long since we have all been together.  I stayed there until almost midnight and headed home after the long day to rest for the big day.  Friday:  Went to the Bride's house for breakfast.  She always amazes me.  She was so calm.  She never, ever gets nervous.  She was born in water, that's why she is so calm.  I wish I was like that!  We watched her pack her wedding night bag, in her sister's school backpack.  It was so surreal.  We had always dreamed of this day and here we were, in the moment itself.  Weird.  She asked if Poot and I would take her overnight bag to the hotel and of course the horns went up and Poot and I said we sure would.  And as we left to let the bride get ready, Poot and I headed out the door with a mission in mind:  PORN.  We immediately went to the local porn shop and bought a dildo, flavored condoms, a feather tickler and a few other small things for the Bride and Groom to enjoy on their wedding night.  :-)  After porn always comes shopping so Poot and I headed off to the mall to find me some red shoes for my black and white party dress.  Poot went on her way to get ready and I headed off to the tanning salon.  I rushed home to shower, eat, and go to my mom's boyfriend’s house.  He is a hair stylist and did an up do for me.  I had him find inspiration for my hairdo in my sassy dress.  He did a great job.  Check pictures for the great hair, boobs and dress.  I then rushed to the wedding where I sat 3rd row.  The ceremony itself was so beautiful.  The music, the vows, the flowers, the dress, the tears.  Everything was perfect.  Everything we had ever dreamed of.  Perfect.  It was a Irish Catholic Mass, so it lasted well over an hour.  Again, perfect for the bride.  We then headed off to the reception.   Perfect location, perfect food, dancing, dancing and more dancing.  I sat at table one and cried at the father/daughter dance.  The groom said to me about his bride "I am so excited that we are married!"  The sweetest thing he could have ever said.  So nice.  I do want to make note that this is truly and honestly the brides affair.  The groom’s family didn't say ONE word the entire evening.  NO SHIT.  Kinda weird, but it really wasn't about them.  Oh yah, the reception had a open bar!  PARTY!  The reception technically ended at midnight, but we carried it until almost 1 a.m., the way any Walsh wedding should be.  A few of us even went out to the bars afterwards.  I ended up schlepping (designated driver) one of the brides brothers back to his house.  He was so completely drunk and was hitting on me and my friend, Carolyn all night.  It was pretty entertaining.  Quote from Bride's Brother:  "Erin, I want to kiss you."  I replied, "No you don't, not while you are this drunk."  He then replied, "Yes I do want to kiss you as well as bite you."  How do you like them apples!?!  I threw up in my mouth and told him to get out of the car.  I told him I would hug him and he then said that he couldn't hug me at that particular moment.  Why?  OH LORD, I AM SO NAIVE!  HE WAS PITCHIN A TENT!  YIKES!!!  The night thankfully ended with a little back pat... sick!  I then came home and had to shower because I was so sweaty and plus my hair would fall out if I slept on it.  I took a 30 minute shower.  It was rough.  Saturday:  Slept in, thankfully.  Eventually made it back over to the Bride's parents house for a BB-Q.  Stayed there all day and left after my lust called to make plans for the evening.  Was looking forward to seeing him.   As I traveled home from the Bride and Groom's BB-Q, I call JD to make plans, hoping that he would come over and we could have a session before going downtown.  Instead he was an ass and told me that he had to pick up his female boss and that Rob could pick me up and then meet him down at Dave and Busters.  PARDON?  I made a smart ass remark like, “oh, so then you want me to be the designated driver?"  And he replied, “Well, you and Rob need to figure that out."  OUCH!  I guess Rob and I were asked to be the DD and pretty much be his bitch.  I played along and acted as if Rob was my date the entire night.  He introduced me as his girlfriend but treated me like trash.  Yah wasn't really feeling the love.  I acted aloof all night and actually ended up having a good time with Rob and John.  We met up with my girlfriend Carolyn and enjoyed our evening.  JD actually had the balls to ask me if I would take this girl home to her hotel and then drive his car to my home.  I initially said yes, but then found out that JD would not be riding with us and that I would have to drive his car alone to my house and then have to pick up his sorry ass the next morning early.  NO FUCKING THANKS!  Thanks for asking.  I pulled him aside and said that I didn't feel comfortable toting this girl's ass around.  I didn't even know this lady.  I felt bad, but not really since I was being treated second best.  Push me aside, that's fine, but don't call me your girlfriend then.  And if you want a DD, ask nicely and I will do it.  But assume that I will do it, and you have fucking pushed me off the deep end!  Yah, it didn't end too well.  Sunday:  JD ignored my phone calls.  I know I shouldn't have called.  He should have called me.  I am impatient like that and couldn't wait, so I called.  Went with mom to look at model homes to search for decorating inspiration for my new home.  Didn't find any but found a HUGE home with 4 levels and 2 wine cellars.  It was amazing.  Brenda and Dave called and Bren broke the news that they had gotten engaged!  I then attempted to call JD again, and we made plans to go over to see the couple.  JD never called.  After several hours I called again and he ended up just wanting to meet over at Dave and Bren’s house.  ASS.  We met over there and JD was an ass.  Bren's ring is amazing.  I can't wait to help plan the wedding and reception!  YEE HAW!  JD and I talked in his car for almost an hour on Bren's driveway.  He thinks we rushed into things and that maybe we need a break.  Huh.  Not what he said a few weeks ago.  Wonder why he had a change of heart?  Wonder what the fuck is going on?  I will fill you in on Friday when he returns to Denver.  ARG  What should I do?!?
