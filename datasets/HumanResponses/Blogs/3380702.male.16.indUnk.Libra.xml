      I have never seen an astrology report so close to everythin gthat goes on in my head  http://www.whodoyoulove.com/loveastrology/suncan.asp  Thats the site, if you want to check it for yourself.  It turns out that every single section on that site describes what goes on in my head relationship wise.  for example ----------------------------------------------------------------- Relationships   Call it a sixth sense, good gut or intuition, but whatever the name, the Crab has it. Members of this sign have an excellent instinct for which partner will serve them well, and once they hone in, it's a laser beam shot. Cancer's charm and magnetism are qualities which will prove most alluring to a lover, and coupled with their nurturing need, will prove hard to resist. The Crab loves to feel secure, so a lover who remembers birthdays and other special days, or simply pops a bottle of champagne for no special reason, will be rewarded with tenderness and affection. If the Crab tests a lover with occasional bouts of jealousy, it's only because a stronger emotional response is craved. The ideal Cancer soulmate can spoon on the couch and watch TV all night long.  -----------------------------------------------------------------  Wasnt there a post where i mentioned having like a sixth sense for when people were about to leave me or something might happen?? If there wasnt a post then it was probably just me talking to Jorge, but either way freaky!  Check that site out its pretty good, who knows what your sign'll tell you?

      Well, though I haven't updated with news in a while, a lot has happened. It was a pretty hectic week.   Well lets see, since last monday.....  Well Monday I had a school concert. That was a sad concert because it was the last concert for the seniors in our class! It was sad, I didnt cry though, I'll do that enough when I see them all leave at graduation. They are very close friends. When you take a class as fun as that with someone for 3 years, you tend to grow attatched. Tear :'(...  Tuesday I had my science research symposium. Now it doesnt seem like a lot but ask Jorge(who btw has a blog at www.jorgenaranjo.blogspot.com) and he'll tell you the work I was doing when I got home. I put up my display board and left to the symposium, getting there about 10 minutes late, thanks for the ride Jorge! THen the hard part started. When you have a topic in astronomy you have to know a lot of background stuff on it. I now understand my project very very well. Everyone pretty much looked at my board and said "The XENON project eh? Sounds liek something I might be able to understand" (compare my title with the Mutagenetic properties of the Ang-2 cytokine in protoplasmic environments.) THat wasnt fun. This one lady came by and simple asked if it had anything to do with the Xenon headlights, I had to try really had not to laugh, then I gave her the longest explanation of her life. It was funny to try and see her squirm out of it. But that wasnt the stupidest question I got that day. Someone had the nerve(or the stupidity) to ask me if my project had anything to do with the reason for Disney naming their movie Zenon. Yeah I know im laughing about too right now. And that was a future Science research student(help us!). Well after explaining my project to that idiot.....I got Priya Rajdev's father.....OMG that guy knows waaaaay to much in my topic. He purposely tried to screw me up. It was insane. For those of you who dont know Priya graduated last year from OHS. She was valedictorian, was a straigh A+ student, played on the tennis team, drew the political cartoons for the school newspaper, was the president of the NHS, and did a million other things apart from being a semifinalist at ISEF, the most prestigious science competition out there(the International Science and Engineering Fair, where you participate agaise people from all over the WORLD!) Fun.  Wednesday was the last concert of the year(there were two concerts one for chorus, band and Orchestra, the other for Fiddle, Chamber Ensemble, and Wind Ensemble. THe reason for two is that it is impossible for a brass or woodwind instrument player to play for that long without getting tired and screwing up)So I played in the Chamber Ensemble and the Fiddle group(yes Violas can play in Fiddle groups). Then I stayed to listen to the Wind Ensemble play. Their first song I didnt think was anything special. But the second song, Sidus was amazing. Part of the background on it was, "Mankind has thought about space for hundreds of years. The Stars, galaxies and whats beyond." The rest I dont remember but it was about the music and how its like a person going through space, and what they would see(in music form, think of reverse fantasia). When the band started this 18 minute masterpiece, I started to tear, because of how beautiful it was. I dont think Ill hear another Wind Ensemble piece that will be that beautiful and move me that much in many many years. Congratulations Seniors....You ended off the school year with a bang. We'll miss you....wait a sec thatll be me there next year!!!  Thursday was OHS day. Basically a day of fun. I hung out with Michelle for the entire time of OHS day, then afterwards we went to the Highland diner to eat. I then dropped her off at work and went home. Jorge came over later followed soon after by Sebastian, Jorge slept ober sebastian left. Friday started another one of my best days. Michelle came over around 3(only because we got started late). We planeed on watching a bunch of movies that I had not seen but she had, that she could not beleive I had never seen(for example Fantasia! I have seen it now...good movie) So from 3 in the afternoon to 2 in the morning it was my equivalent to J&J time. Almost 12 hours of hanging out with her, who could wish for anything better(ok, life would be better but that wont happen right now) Thats why I dare you to tell me how things could get any better. An awesome day where the only downpart was having to bring her home...   Speaking of awesome days.... remember a while back when I was really annoyed with my aunt over wanting to sell the house I live in? Well my parents called me the other day and told me, "WE BOUGHT THE HOUSE!" SO IM NOT MOVING!! YAY!!!! Happy days are here again! I knew if I left things alone, they would turn out all right. It always does.  Well thats all for now....TTFN(ta ta for now, guess what one of the movies I watched was??)

      Well another beautiful day! Im glad that everything is working out again. I was beggining to think that nice guys do finish last. But now im in first place with a year between myself and the next guy, thanks Michelle.   So lets see my last post was on Friday(ok i know it says saturday but thats because it was 1 in the morning). So first up is Saturday.  Can you say best god damn day ever!? OK so it didnt start out that way but it turned into the best day ever at night. More later. So anyway I wake up that morning at like 730(didnt go out afterall at 1 30)and trek off to bring scott and sebastian home. I get back home and to my very great surprise, My mom has us cleaning the house. Now at this point its like 1130 and the party is at 730, but i have to go pick up michelle and valentina at 6. Not to mention I have to clean myself up before I go. SO I speed clean my room. Vacuum everyhting, dust. And move on to the living room. Barrel through that, its now 4. At this time I decide,"I should probably eat something" So I eat breakfast and my mom tells me, do the laundry, so I give her this long look and she break apart and decides to let me just do some of the laundry and do the rest tomm. Yay!. Its 6:00 and im all done cleaning. So I jump in the shower and clean off. It was hot outside so I was sweaty like woah. I pull out my dress outfit(the nice black suit and tie and black shirt) get dressed and pull away in the car card for tali in hand. I pick up michelle first, then grab valentina on my way back up. We stop by the Prescription Plus pharmacy to pick up a card for Tali from Michelle and Also another from Valentina and I pull over to the florist nearby to pick up a bouquet of roses for Tali(hey everyone else is probably gonna get her money, ill get her flowers!) So we got her cards and whatnot and headed over to the site of her party. We got there with relative ease, and as soon as I got close enough to see what everyone else was wearing I immediately felt overdressed. She said look nice, but i was in a tux. Oh well I decided, If im gonna look good, might as well make it real good. So since we got there early we had some time to spare. Kinda just hung out till other people got there. Adele shows up in a very chic dress. Jorge and Judith show up a while later. And the rest of the people I know show up trickling in as time went by. When the party got under way people started dancing. Now I looked at the request sheet and immediately thought, aww man another rap party. But upon further inspection there was music from z100 as well as hot 97. Each of those dated as far back as december 1998. So i pull through the z100 list and come across none other than every Morning by Sugar Ray. Yay! So the DJ plays the music and does his stuff. I drag Michelle out onto the dance floor at first, and as soon as she loosened up a bit she had fun. Michelle you are an awsome dancer. What were you talking about? We ate we danced we were merry, we went into the guys bathroom together...(naughty people what were you thinking! The girls bathroom sink was broken so she washed her hands in the boys bathroom one.) The DJ never played my song, but thats OK. After like an hour or two of rap and old z100 music, i got kinda tired of hearing the same stuff over and over again, so since I got so much closer to michelle, decided to get a slow song. Had fun with that song, and then went back to the hectic world of rap and everything else we listen to. FOr one brief but awsome song, I got to show off my Latinness. The DJ played a Merengue. OH SO MUCH FUN!!! Michelle had pretty much just got the hang of regular dancing so she kinda decided to sit this one out. Of course Adele was right there, and since i remembered that she is part spanish, I thought, "hey why the hell not!" SO we started dancing and wow! Adele is one crazy good dancer! I knew she was spanish but I didnt know that she was that good at dancing to spanish music. Just goes to show you, never judge a book by its cover. An Awesome merengue (pronounced meh-rhen-geh). Actually the first time ive danced that in a looong time. So after that they started playing old music, i mean stuff like Grease. It was funny because when they played the spanish music all but myself jorge judith, felix adele and valentina pretty much sat down, but when they played the old music we were the ones sitting. it was fun. After the party Michelle and I headed to the Croton diner after dropping people off, met Jorge who was on his way out(Judith had to go home :'( tear) then sat down to eat food. We were there from like 11 to 1230 and then I brought her home. I said goodbye and went home. Instantly fell asleep. An awesome day indeed. Happy birthday Tali and thanks for the Awesome party!  Sunday was makeup day. I had to wash the rest of that clothes, which took me all day, and then had to do all my homework. Michelle and I barely got to talk(since she was out bowling...tear...:'(). ANd then at night went to Antioch, my youth group. I dont think ive mentioned them much here, ill do that later this post is huge as it is. Went there, listened to an awesome talk by Alanna then went to the diner. Bagels with butter and jelly are addictive. Youve been warned. THe day was all good till I heard about some ugly rumours. I instantly became worried for the sanity of my close friend and tried to help any way possible. In the end things got cleared up and unfortunately now, it seems as though people that I thought I could trust can't be trusted so wholly anymore. Oh well, c'est la vie....  Monday, today, was great too. Got up and into school went through the day as usual while hanging out with Michelle as much as possible, and at 730 went to play at the concert. All the groups played wonderfully. The chorus was beautiful(the womens choir). I looked up at them on the balcony and listened to them sing their song and almost started to cry because i had reflected so much to that same song. I remember looking up and seeing Raquel and immediately thinking of how many other seniors were leaving...a very sad thought. The full chorus played a personal favorite of mine where Emma Donson was a solo singer. Her voice is incredible for such a small person. She always takes me by surprise when she sings. The band copied us and played a holst, and quite coincidentally they played a Dargason(the same last movement as ours). This is the best part. At 725 the unthinkable happens.....my "A" string breaks!! the concert started at 730 and we are on last so its not so much a bad thing except I now have a 3 stringed viola...not good. And its the last concert of the year??? Even worse! I wanted to be really good for this concert. I love the calss thats leaving so very dearly and Im sad to see them go, so i have to play good at their last concert. Now, youre probably thinking why dont you just replace it. And at first its the same thought that went in my head, then i remember, oh wait its humid, and that will keep my instrument out of tune(humidity kills string instruments, it makes the pegs swollen and lets them slide allowing the strings to go flat.) and also new strings do not like to be in tune. Im screwed. Then to make matters worse Mrs Weiss cant get the string into the fine tuner, so now I have a near perpetual out of tune viola with a new a string waterlogged from the humidity and without a fine tuner to at least make tuning easier and keep it more closely in tune. Im screwed. Well come the first song the instrument stays in tune. Then between it goes out. I tune it in seconds. THe next song....still in tune all the way! THen the surprise song, Lullaby. We play lullaby for Mrs Weiss as a goodbye tribute to her. And that was the most beautiful time we have ever played it. THrough some miracle my instrument stayed in tune the entire time. Then as soon as the concert was over, it goes soo horribly out of tune i just packed it up and left it alone. Thank you God!! That was truly a miracle. So now im at home recallin gthe last 3 days events to you. Talking to Michelle, and doing research work. This is The Man In Tan saying goodnight all. Oh and I take it back, this has now become my longest post. Also our Dargason was sooo much better than the bands!!  -The Man in Tan-   Current Mood:  So God damn happy!!! Current Music: Lullaby-(some random composer, Ill put it tomm.)

      So Today was every 30 minute day at school. Every 30 minutes a person pretended to be a memory. Which was fun because Apparently Mr Goldberg Died too. Now dead people shouldnt talk but Jones apparently was able to accomplish the feat of getting the dead to talk....and they said "Bite me!".   After school today was awesome. Went out to see Shrek 2 with, well if youd ask me youd know who(her name wont be out here until like a month later, because by then people will already have known). That was an awesome movie. It was hilarious. Especially the Puss in Boots. HE WAS SPANISH!!! It was hilarious, especially because he yelled at The Donkey(at that point a stallion) in SPANISH!!! that was fun. Before the movie ate dinner with her. Then after the movie went to go find a birthday gift for Tali. Her sweet 16 is tomm.   Well times is good, and I'd like to keep it that way. Im about to go out with Scott and Sabby. Yes, out at 1 30 in the morning. But its all good. Ill c yall tomm. Adios!   O and yeah... WILLIAM HUNG'S VOICE IS THE DEVIL INCARNATE!

      One step closer... Morning! Well I'm back to blogging for today. I can tell this will take me a long time because Im talking to "her" I should give "her" a name its getting really hard to skip around the name thing. So from now on i will call "her" Jane. Today was a regular school day. A week before the concert I got to play in the fiddle group so that made me happy. I dropped a bunch of people home then brought Jane home. I went home myself and was talking to Jane online when she mentioned the art display at the library. So I hopped back in my car picked her up and went to go see it with her. When i brought her home I got o my homework and she went to her music lesson. I was talking to her online and got to the topic of momories. So many old feelings rushed back into my head. It was nice yet sad at the same time. She is definitely a light for me. Definitely my Angel de Amor. Check this out... ------------------------------------------------------------- Wednesday, May 19, 2004  you know when it just seems like everything is going right? like everything is turning out the way you always wanted it to? when your life just feels perfect?  my life is perfect right now. ------------------------------------------------------------- From her blog! God I am so happy right now i just might soil myself! Okay maybe not, but im so happy that there is nothing that can get me down not even the thoughts of the lost poetry.  I really really hope this works out now.   Current Mood:  enthralled Current Music: Nature Boy-Moulin Rouge

      Sorry about not updating in soo long, had tons of stuff to do. But My short term memory has faithfully allowed me to forget it all.   Oh man, Thursday at six flags was awesome. Seeing as that was only the second time I have ever gone to six flags it was so very cool. I got to hang out at Six flags with some awesome friends(most of which wont be returning sadly :(....) We got to do our part of the show in the auditorium like everyone else. I dont see why they would put an auditorium up next to the Batman and Robin ride(which I did not go on, you couldnt pay me to get on it...ok maybe you could). Everytime it would pass b, all the sound would get drowned out. Though the day was fun I did really bad that time. And on my best part too. I couldnt beleive how much I screwed up on the scarecrow scene. But it turns out a lot of people screwed up so no big.   Thursday was an even better day when I found out the best news ever to date since April 20th. So as we all know(if youve been keeping up with my journal) I've had a crush on several people for these past few weeks. I had to sort my mind out to find out if it was just withdrawl or actually like. It turns out that one of them is not my type(after more looking into the matter) and another is still nice, but i could never see myself with her because she isnt old enough(not that age is a thing, its that shes not up to the level, maturely, that I was looking for). Luckily for me the third was a good match. Everyone I have ever like was funny and smart and caring, thats a given but this person took it further. She used her with to teach herself all kinds of things. From foreing languages to programming languages she did it all. A vocalist and pianist she is very much on the same level of music as i am. I think the most surprising part to me is that this person was being chased after by a friend of mine for so very long. And I laughed a bit when i thought, what comes around goes around. Lately hes been kind of an ass about things, and I just shrugged it off ignoring it. And now he gets a little slap in the face. Not that i'm doing it to get back at him, just that it turns out that I've fallen for the person hes been going after for so long. Now what makes all of this so special is that(and i usually have like a 6th sense about matters of the heart, I can almost always tell when things will fall apart and when new things are growing, not to mention most people can)I was talking to her(still thurs) and she sent me this survey that her and the friend mentioned above had created some year(s) back. So I filled it out, honestly. A lot of the questions on it were personal, and a lot of them involved the people you liked or had affairs with in the past. But I answered as truthfully as possible. So the question about who I had a crush on, that one I answered her. And Much to my surprise she sends me the survey, with her answers. And it turns out that she feels the same way about me. Talk about having renewed passion for life. I was just about To give up on everything again. But once again just as the night was darkest God blessed me with yet another person for me to be happy again. I only wish he didnt have to wait till things were so bleak. But I have high hopes with this person. Wish me luck.  Friday, I have no idea what I did. Wait no I lied. I went minigolfing with jorge. We picked up a shyte load of golf balls and they are still lying in the passengers seat of my car. It was fun. We then proceeded to steal the golf clubs as a parting gift and went on our merry way home.  Saturday I went to Lake Compounce with Joanna and Jorge and Rob and Mike and Brian and Scott. We had a lot of fun. I really got a kick out of helping Jorge get over his fears. I went on a few rides. After the park we all went to Joannas house for dinner and a rousing game of Karaoke revolution. Allergies really suck with that game. My voice cracked a lot so I couldnt get as high a score as I wanted but I had fun nonetheless.  Sunday I woke up and proceeded to write my entire talk for that nights Youth Group meeting. It was on Unity. I wrote an awesome talk. Everyone loved it. But of course thats what everyone expects when they hear a talk from me. I used Michael Jacksons Black or White because it had issues of separation in it. When I got home that sunday I talked to my shining star(umm not to be confused with the shining star in the commercial...as nice as that might have been for them, shes not my shining star because of the song, she just is my 'shining star'). During that conversation I started to write a song, Which I have currently titled Life the Game. Its the current standing title. Lets see if it stands. Unfortunately One riff into the song, I lost a G string. So the song will have to wait until i repair my Guitarra.  Monday was a good day, came in late to school but that didnt matter. I had music lessons for most of the day resulting in like one class, programming. I practiced for the programming contest on tues. During the day I dont really get to talk to my special someone too much. So whenever I do I'm very happy. Hey at least shes close to home. Jorge slept over today. Yeah its random but whatever hes lots of fun to hang out with. Possibly because of all my friends I have bonded with him the most. He really tries to be friends with as many people as possible. So while all the other people in my group of friends(at the early stage where dan hernandez was just a speck in their eyes) He really reached out and hung out and talked to me a lot more. Not to say that I dont like the other people. I love you guys completely(as a friend). I just bonded more with him.  Today was so much fun but so much pain. The programming contest was insanely difficult. Despite the fact that it was intended for AP Java students Yang Li and I accomplished 2 of the programs. Yang wrote the code for the two that were finished. I wrote the code to a third but after all the coding was done, I still had an error somewhere. The two numbers for my problem never equaled each other. Its a very long problem so I wont write it up here unless you really want to know the details, so if you do just leave a comment and ill post the details. So when I got back home today I sat down talked to my special someone(in case you havent guessed I dont plan on giving out her name, not yet. I really do not want to jinx this, plus I don't a million people coming up to me going \'aww you go out with ______" Thats just kind of annoying. And then I sat down here to write this blog. So I hope you enjoyed reading what might just have been my longest post ever.

      So heres where I left off:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well since last Saturday mucho has happened. Lets see...On Sunday I had a regular day. I woke up I got out of bed and I went to Antioch. Nothing new to report here. After Antioch, I hung out at the diner with some friends and then we went to Carolines for a bit. When I came home I was just about ready to go to sleep. But seeing as El Amor de mi vida was online I talked to her. She said she had to go to sleep at like 2 but we were up till like 330 at which point she noted that she always wanted to see the sunrise. I said, "Hey if you can get out I can get you to go see the sunrise." She was somewhat reluctant at first(her parents werent home but she wasnt supposed to leave her parents alone. So I talked to her for a bit longer and then she told...oka mid sentence change in train of thought, after a 30 min lecture and absorption of verbal abuse, I cant write anymore goodnight.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Before that little intrusion on my train of thought by my parents I wouldve continued to write and have a great little post. But since they like to bug me....Oh well whatever, time to finish that post.   So anyway before I left, I took Michelle out of her house at like 3:30 and went to Senasqua park to see the sunrise. The sky was a beautiful color(almost as beautiful as her), but the sun was hidden behind the trees, oh well theres always next time.   So we woke up that same Monday to go to the Cheesecake Factory with Jorge and Judith. We left and got there around 4(This is the Cheesecake Factory in the Westchester Mall, Note: THe Cheesecake Factory is not....I repeat is not an actual factory....it is an established eatery!) When we got there we had about a 15 minute wait....ha that was funny because my clock said 40 min! It wasnt that bad but we were all getting really hungry. During the wait Jorge and Judith had some exotic foods(each other). Actually they were just really friendly they didnt eat each other. Michelle and I held each other close because I was too busy being self-conscious(THEY WERE ALL STARING!! AHH!!). SO we finally got called in and went to have ourselves some good eats(Sorry Alton Brown!). MIchelle had herself some quesadillas and I had myself the usual Chicken Marsala. I dont remember what Jorge and Judith ate. I feel kinda bad that I kept teasing MIchelle about the scarf around her seeing as I'm the reason its there in the first place! I was always like "Michelle aren't you hot in that scarf?" and then laughed heartily as I watched the confused expressions on Jorge and Judiths face every time, and the Pleading look on Michelles as she said "Stop it!" So we finish eating and Jorge and I split up the bill(Sorry ladies you cant pay! You know that! It's just not cool on our part!) So on our way out the ladies had to go to the ladies room. As a little joke Jorge and I stationed ourselves at either side of the girls bathroom door, and some kid came up to me and was like, is it ok to use the bathroom? Do I really look like I would work at that place. I wonder what wouldve happened if I had said " No, there is someone in there!" Oh well. SO on our way out we got onto the elevator to take us to the floor where Jorges  car  was. And when the elevator was moving Judith kinda crashed into Jorge. Now just seconds before this monstrous...um thing....(i think it was an african american human fat lady, but it was more likely than not some diseased cow and mutated Gorilla half-breed bastard child), had looked and smiled at Jorge and Judith because on the elevator they were separated and Judith was reaching out to Jorge and said "Ah, Separation Anxiety!!". So "IT" let out a smile. But when Judith fell into Jorge(his arms, damn you dirty minded people!), as IT left from the elevator car(and the car let out a sigh of relief)she pokes Judith rather roughly several times on her shoulder, and the thing spoke. It said in a very butch voice "Hey, you watch what you are doing!". IT then proceeded to shake its head in disgust and walk away. Great jokes from that one. Like "Whoops the zoo let another one escape!". Fun times. That was a fun Double Jorge and Judith, we should do it again sometime.  okay folks, one day down 6 to go! hehe...  Tuesday was a great day. Came into school had my regular class day and proceeded to hang out with Michelle as much as possible. So in the attempt to increase the time I spent with her, I went over to her house to say hello and actually meet her family. SO after school I dropped by with her and met her cat and her sisters cat. Later(around 6) I met her mom, and then her dad. The whole time we were on her couch talking. Being invited to dinner, I ate with them and continued to hang out with Michelle. THe biggest topic of the eveneing between us was our past experiences with relationships. Ok then. At around 11 my parents called and I had to get going. It took us like an hour just to say goodbye. We can never say goodbye, its always too soon.  Ill finish posting the rest of the days later, too much to remember, i have to write it out first.   I LOVE YOU MICHELLE!!!!!!

      So heres where I left off:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Well since last Saturday mucho has happened. Lets see...On Sunday I had a regular day. I woke up I got out of bed and I went to Antioch. Nothing new to report here. After Antioch, I hung out at the diner with some friends and then we went to Carolines for a bit. When I came home I was just about ready to go to sleep. But seeing as El Amor de mi vida was online I talked to her. She said she had to go to sleep at like 2 but we were up till like 330 at which point she noted that she always wanted to see the sunrise. I said, "Hey if you can get out I can get you to go see the sunrise." She was somewhat reluctant at first(her parents werent home but she wasnt supposed to leave her parents alone. So I talked to her for a bit longer and then she told...oka mid sentence change in train of thought, after a 30 min lecture and absorption of verbal abuse, I cant write anymore goodnight.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Before that little intrusion on my train of thought by my parents I wouldve continued to write and have a great little post. But since they like to bug me....Oh well whatever, time to finish that post.   So anyway before I left, I took Michelle out of her house at like 3:30 and went to Senasqua park to see the sunrise. The sky was a beautiful color(almost as beautiful as her), but the sun was hidden behind the trees, oh well theres always next time.   So we woke up that same Monday to go to the Cheesecake Factory with Jorge and Judith. We left and got there around 4(This is the Cheesecake Factory in the Westchester Mall, Note: THe Cheesecake Factory is not....I repeat is not an actual factory....it is an established eatery!) When we got there we had about a 15 minute wait....ha that was funny because my clock said 40 min! It wasnt that bad but we were all getting really hungry. During the wait Jorge and Judith had some exotic foods(each other). Actually they were just really friendly they didnt eat each other. Michelle and I held each other close because I was too busy being self-conscious(THEY WERE ALL STARING!! AHH!!).
