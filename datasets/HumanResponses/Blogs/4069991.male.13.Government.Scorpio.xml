      wow this song aint non-long   look at all tha non-non long words n paragraphs tha hole thing goes for 6 minutes i fink..   How Come by D12  Album :&nbsp; Submitted by : KimShady Corrected by : Nina Mathers Rated : - (0 votes)  [Eminem]  How Come.. we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe dont barely keep in touch at alland I dont even feel the same love when we hug no moreAnd I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin NowAfter all the years we been down.. aint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!  We were so young So full of life and vibrance side by side, wherever you was riding, I wentSo close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shitWhen Ronnie died you was right by my side with a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes and a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it. You even had the same type of childhood I did.. sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours and mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it we grew up, grew apart as time went by us.. and I blew up to both yours and mines surprises.Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe itmuch as your pride tries to hide it. you're coldyour touch is just like ice. And your eyes is a look of resentment.I can sense it and I dont like it.  How Come.. we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe don't barely keep in touch at alland I don't even feel the same love when we hug no moreAnd I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin NowAfter all the years we been down.. aint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!  [Kon Artis]  It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse on my own album with a deal but shit got worsefore I came out I woulda killed a nigga firstfor I let him disrespect me, or check me over some worthless bitch that I wasnt withI woulda hit it and quitbut you were fitting to talk with her and tell her she was the shitI told you dont get involved with heryou would smoke in the car with hercoming outta the bar with herstumbling half drunklike you were husband and wife or somethinbut me catching her fuckin other niggas musta hurt your pride or somethingcause you were openin your mouth to people like you wanted with me.when all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty.And every sister, fares and all the shit that I producedyou acting like I aint your man and lying like she cant be loose.But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth.Dont hate the game or the playerthe one thats changing is you.  [Eminen]  How Come.. we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe dont barely keep in touch at alland I dont even feel the same love when we hug no moreAnd I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin NowAfter all the years we been down.. aint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!  [Proof]  Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stopnow we acting like I gotta live only for the block.And homies in the hood only see me on the tubeSo they gossip on the porchGet ta speaking all rude. fools I used to rap wit all expect magiclike my finger get to snappinand poof it just happen. But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown, shady made it so my babies aint starving at home. See the devil in your glance, since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intellegence, thats forever till the end. I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the satan in your lies, aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise. (HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life? And everytime I go to hear you play, you look away, we barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face.  [Eminem]  How Come.. we dont even talk no moreAnd you dont even call no moreWe dont barely keep in touch at alland I dont even feel the same love when we hug no moreAnd I heard it through the grapevine.. We even Beefin NowAfter all the years we been down.. aint no way no howThis bullshit cant be trueWe Family.. aint a damn thing changed.. unless its you!
