      im having so much fun cause you can publish everything from your IM now its really cool, i love this blogger site its the best one ive ever seen but google is the best and its all powered by google. my bro is being annoying cause hes playing life with my sister and hes winning and bragging alot. funny thing is he says he loves the game but once i played with him and he said he hated the game cause he was losing. some one is a poor sport to day atleast my sis is putting up with it and his mood swings at the game. when he gets money he loves and when he loses money he hates it. its pretty funny i guess but you have to be here. &nbsp; urlLink

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why? Cause the one day my uncle doesn't care how late i sleep i wake up at nine. So i was thinking i could sleep till two or whatever, and i stayed up till four. NO thats not what tommy had in mind, he thinks when something goes wrong its my fault. and someone took his mountain dew so he wakes me up. He know that when someone wakes me up i dont go back to sleep. the worst part is, im hungry. we dont have any good food.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well thats all the complaining for one day. ill tell you about yesterdaysince i already explained my day. So i went to the rec until nine, when i was only going to go until seven but i was having fun. so coming home, two hours late for anna's going away party, i went over, Just in time for the movie school of rock, well a little before because the thing kept messing up. and it was pretty fun, especially for it being all eighth graders i hardly knew. I came home at about 12 from that, and then i read, (yes read it sounds geeky but i couldnt make noise without getting in trouble and you cant call people that late, but anyways i read....) until four then went to sleep, and here i am now. WHen i was reading a thought crossed my mind, and illl say it cause no one reads my blog, allison probably crapped her&nbsp; pants when she started going out with braunson. shes only like hime forever. n e ways my bro is playing james bond and its really violent. he was like sending electric pulses through an old guy. i know its just a game but it seems real and there are people doing that.&nbsp; well i guess i shouldve expected that cause all james bond is, is a character who blow peoples heads off and gets a really hot chick in the process. sad thing is there are tons of guys who think that its the best thing ever and wish that was them. thats why they invented video games, for all the geeks who wish that was really them. i know that sounds harsh but its maybe like 50% true but im just babbling like an idiot.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this is sad ive spent almost and hour writing this. o well not like there is anything else to do. i hate the word mingle~i feel like you had to know that~and i love the word peeved~you to know that to~and i love making these(~) squiggley lines. SO im gonna go now and mess around on this web site.

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; home from Montana, I love being home and&nbsp; i want to go back to montana at the same time. it feels so weird being home. like im so used to my dads laptop, i mean the mouse feel weird, and typing is weird too. but i like seeing my mom and the kitty cats, and stuff like that. the house feels so big compared to my dads apartment. and i miss the view and his balcony. but i am soo excited! i am going to the fair with callie and erin might come, and erin and i might do something tomorrow. im really excited. and sad to say i even want to go back to school. (well at least to see my friends.      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So n e ways today we drove the afternoon away.(i am so stupid) and we saw my uncle in slc and we are probably going to see hime tomorrow, yahhhh. i got new shoes and they are converse! and pink! i wouldve got the green and yellow but anna has them. i wouldnt want to copy the soon to be former neighbor. and i also got one of those cute little build-a-bear things. its a rabbit and her name is heidi! so uhh im going to go now buh bye~

      i was reading some recent posts and i sound like drunk of something. why am i such a tard the world will never know. im tired but i really really dont want to sleep. my mom said i can stay on the comp until ten thirty. so im using every minute writing an actual post. not from hello. i cant believe that the summer is almost gone. i feel like crying, i dont know why though. why the hell do i bother writing in something like this that no body will read. none of my friends bother with blogs and my sisters friends dont care about me. Finished reading The Lottery its a really good book. read it sometime. wait my comp cant read books and no one is reading this. o well. for some reason right now im glad i look thirteen. its funny though people who just assume im like thirteen or whatever treat me differently. but if they know im eleven they treat me like a kid. i dont like it. well lots of ppl dont like to be treated like kids. so maybe im not any different. there are probably lots of people my age that have the same thing going on. like right know i wish i could skip a grade. well if nobody is reading this then they dont have the misfurtune of reading my babble. crap its almost 10:30 i dont want to get off. i am not done writing this post!!!!if im lucky my mom will have fallen asleep giving me atleast fifteen more minutes. but i dont want to look. great now ive cysced myself out and im hearing noises. is that healthy? well my whole habbit until school starts is probably unhealthy.        i should start thinking about school but i dont want to. ill start next week. hey tomorrow is friday the thirteenth. i dont believe that superstittious (sp?) stuff but i like when its friday the thirteenth. well i just thought. (for once) in one week i will have my hair new. then. thats when i will think about school. hey ive even already done a great job of losing my schedule and supplie list. snaps for helen. wow maybe my teacher will like me next year with me staying from from the title of brown-noser. ashlee simpson is addicting to listen to. but i had to stop listening for some strain of hope to be quiet and let my mom peacefully go to sleep. so maybe now i will go to my room and listen to it. but i finally am having fun babbling. sadly thought is slipping from my mind and im drifting into sleep. heh that was deep and cheesy. a nice combonation. i wonder if my locker combo will be on my list of things i keep forgetting. probably a no after a month or two. well im still praying on the yes mrs. crouch will give me for blgging instead of journaling. but i highly doubt she will say yes. well good bye. im going to go listen to ashlee, and wish my hair looked like avril's. more tomorrow, hopefully

      i made like twenty million posts on friday, hehehe. i was going to post yesterday but  every time i got the chance i had to get off. that and my hello wasnt working and i like this one better, its way easier. its weird but i cant wait until school starts. i went to the movies today with callie, and right after we made plans haleigh called and wanted to know if i could go to the movies with her and michelle. i mean not to be rude but i its kinda oblious who i wanted to go with. but i couldnt break my plans with callie cause she would've hated me.  i really hope that for once i can do something with them. i wanted to see anchorman so bad. theyll be other chances. you know i am REALLY glad that my uncle made me go to the rec. i had an awsome time. erin even has to admitt getting pushed into a swimming pool is hilarous. i wish mrs crouch would let us do blogs instead of journals. maybe ill ask her. if i can do that. i  mean give her the link and she can make a comment with my grade. i mean and typing is sooooo much better than having a notebook to write in. i mean thats the best idea ive had all summer. i have to remember to sugget that to her. man that was a great idea. i think some one should congradulate me on that great idea. well im going to go now buh bye, a? ? ?
