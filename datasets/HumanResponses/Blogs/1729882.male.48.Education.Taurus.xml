      I am going to start exercising more.  My doctor has been trying to get me to do this regularly for awhile.  My wife has bugged me about it too.  Now that school is out, I'm going to attempt it.  I want to start walking 1 or 2 miles a day at least 4 times each week.  I also want to start lifting some light weights at least a couple of times each week.  I hope this blog will keep me at it by updating my progress.  Cross you fingers.

      I was reading the paper this morning when I came across a letter to the editor.  The basis of the letter was that anyone who is opposed to the war in Iraq or even the atrocities at the prison should get out of America.  "America, love it or leave it," sound familiar?  It should if you know anything about the war in Vietnam.  It went on to resurrect the ghosts of 9/11.  "They" caused the horror of the WTC and at the Pentagon and "they" can only get what they deserve.  I heard similar arguments when the story of Mi Lai (spelling?) came out.  Nobody can tell me that history doesn't repeat itself.  Iraq is this generations Vietnam.  We shouldn't be there, and we have no way of winning.  I don't want to see another wall with a list of the names of the dead who died for no reason.  Don't get me wrong, one thing is going to be different about this war.  There won't be any "blame" forced upon the soldiers who are doing their duty.  However, wrong I see this war, these soldiers were given orders to carry out and have done so admirably, despite a few rotten apples.  You can no more win a war than you can win an earthquake. --Jeannette Rankin

      I'm going to scream if this rain doesn't stop soon.  This is killing our baseball schedule.  I know farmers like rain, but enough is enough.  Give me a week of sunshine and warm weather.  If you have an extra million dollars you want to get rid of, I'll take that too.  I'm not picky.

      Both sons had their last day of school today.  #1 graduated from 8th grade, made the honor roll, and got a Presidential Academic Award.  #2 graduated from 5th grade and also made the honor roll.  Despite what I've said before, they are turning out to be pretty good kids.

      #1 is fourteen years old and as they say, I'm not sure he's going to make it to fifteen.  One minute he is depressed for whatever reason, the next minute he thinks he is God's gift to the "ladies."  He argues with his mother, his brother, and me.  He starts "going out" with a girl and two weeks later he breaks up with her.  Working hard for something was always his way of doing things until lately.  Now, if his mother and I would let him, he spends all of his time on the computer.  Yes, we do have time limits set.  I'm hoping this is his early teen phase and will outgrow it.  SOON, I hope!  Love him, just don't always like him.

      #2 pitched five innings of scoreless ball, drove in the go ahead run, and scored the winning run.  Not bad for a day at the 'ol ballpark.

      Nothing much today.  My #2 son played a baseball game.  We won 3 - 1.  He still didn't have a hit and he played second base the whole game.  No pitching today.  "A" pitched all seven innings.  I hope that doesn't come back to haunt us later in the year (worn out arm).  #1 son plays tomorrow night.  I have to tell his coach that he will miss a game the 26th.  He won't be happy.  Such is life.

      Every parent of every child thinks that child is the star of the team.  Someone once told me that and I have no doubt that it is true.  I know that I feel that way about my 2 sons.  The difference between parents is that I refuse to yell and scream at a coach if they do not play my sons the way I think they should.  When a player is just learning to play baseball let's say, they need to learn the game and play as much as possible in a lot of different positions.  But after playing for 8 years, there are some players that don't belong in certain positions.  They can't handle the ball and they might get hurt.  No one wants to sit on the bench the whole game.  I think that they should play somewhere every game, but better players deserve to play more.  We have become so concerned with not hurting someone's self-esteem, that we forget that is exactly what we do when a   team   loses because a poorer player makes mistakes that a better player might not have made.  Parents need to lighten up and let a coach do his/her job.  We won't always agree with everything they do, but that's what makes it fun.  Arm chair quarterbacks and second guessing is the best part about sports.

      #2 son had a baseball game tonight.  He started the game as pitcher.  Pitched 3 innings of no-hit ball.  Awesome huh?  He is depressed because he can't get a hit.  He wants to hit the ball so bad he can taste it.  He is pushing too hard.  As far as playing the field goes, he is one of the best players and is  the  best pitcher, but he can't get that hit and it bugs him.  What can I do?

      Day after my birthday.  Thank God that's over!  Had batting practice for my son's team today.  Why is it that kids that haven't been hitting the ball refuse to make any changes which might make them better hitters?  Uncoachable is the word I would use.  Today's quote applies here I think.

      Been there, done that for 48 years, wish it would stop rearing its ugly head.  I don't want to be dead, I just want to stop observing birthdays.  I get pissed off if people don't remember and I get pissed off when people make a big deal out of it.  Sounds like I get pissed off a lot, doesn't it?

      Surprised my brother and his wife on their 40th wedding aniversary.  The whole family was there.  My sons got to meet cousins they have never seen before.  All my sister-in-law could do was scream for about 5 full minutes!  We had a blast.

      #1 son's high school career started today.  He had his first Cross country practice today.  Upperclassmen were there and I think he was a little nervous about that.  Everything went great.  He enjoyed himself and actually met a few new people.  YEA!!!!  We'll see how things go once the newness wears off.

      Yesterday was bad enough.  This morning we got a call that our #1 son had been  arrested !  He spent the night with some friends and they decided to go out late and throw rocks at cars.  Must have dropped him on his head when he was little.  The sheriff was called, they were handcuffed, taken to jail,  and we were called.  He will have to appear in court soon and will probably have to pay damages to the car owners.  He says that he wasn't throwing at cars like the others were.  Unfortunately, even if true, that means squat.  The sheriff did say that he didn't show any attitude to them and was very polite.  Hopefully this scared the  SHIT  out of him.  His life is about to become quite different for the next several weeks (months?, years?).

      #2 son had 11 year old All-Star tryouts today.  He fielded the ball with no problems.  He caught the ball in the outfield with ease.  He even hit the ball better than he has all year.  But, the one thing that he has excelled at the whole year, pitching, he didn't even attempt to do.  When I asked him why not, all he would say is, "I don't want to!"  Needless to say, I was livid.  He has pitched awesome all year.  He is getting the same attitude that his older brother has - If I have to work for it, I don't want it.  I think he is afraid that he will be facing tougher hitters in tournaments and he won't do as well.  His brother isn't even going to try out for the team because he hasn't hit well this year.  I have offered numerous times to take him to the cage to hit, but he never wants to.  He wants to be good without any effort.  Being the baseball nut that I am, this is driving me crazy.  I want to yell and scream, but I don't want to push them into something I want and they don't.  Don't know what to do.

      Just got back from a workshop on teaching writing.  It was not what I wanted or hoped for.  Writing is the "thing" in education right now.  I am looking for a plan on how to teach writing.  As usual in education, we are given a lot of theory but no practical application.  Guess I'm getting to old and set in my ways to figure this out for myself.

        Reality TV sucks.&nbsp; It has no basis in reality.&nbsp; I'll take a good baseball game anyday.  Why can't coaches be fair.&nbsp; I know some kids are better than others, but to play a kid 1/2 of an inning when others are playing the whole game is not right.  In keeping with the baseball theme -   GO CARDINALS!!     Bush has got to go!&nbsp; (I'm just not thrilled with Kerry either.)   Motivation and procrastination - a winning combination.&nbsp; Especially when it comes to diet and exercise.  School starts in 3 weeks - yippee?  Everyone talked about how Steven King's   Dark Tower   series was so good.&nbsp; I am reading the first book and am not that excited about it.  Should I buy a Palm PDA?  We are taking the boys to the   Brickyard 400   in Indy.&nbsp; What am I getting myself into?

      My son keeps telling me that times now are different than they were when I was a kid.  He says that I don't understand how things are now.  I used to argue with him.  I am a teacher and I see kids everyday in their stressed out world.  I would trade their day for my day anytime.   But,  I got to thinking(Scary huh?), I'm comparing apples with oranges.  Sure an adults life is tougher than a kids, most people would agree with that.  But do kids today have it tougher than I did when I was fourteen?  Yeah, I have to agree that they do.  Many things are still the same especially when it comes to peer pressure.  The number of distractions that kids have to put up with today are tremendous.  My boys go from one sport right into another sport all year long.  I didn't even know what soccer was when I was fourteen.  His mother and I are constantly running them hither, thither, and yon.  Studying is more intense now than it used to be.  We are pushing kids to learn more every year.  All this said, there is nothing new here.  Kids today have it tougher, I had it tougher than my parents did when they were fourteen, and my grandkids will have it tougher than my sons do.  This is the natural course of things.  The way it has been and will always be.  So I agree that times now are different than they were when I was a kid.  I will continue to argue with him that I don't understand what it is like to be a kid.  I may be 48, but I remember what high school was like and I wouldn't go back there for winning lottery ticket!

      Watching the movie "Independence Day" and Judd Hirsch looks at Jeff Goldblum and says, "I'm proud of you son."  It made me think how many times I've said that to my sons.  Not nearly enough.  I think I need to change that.    If you want to be free, there is but one way; it is to guarantee an equally full measure of liberty to all your neighbors. There is no other.
