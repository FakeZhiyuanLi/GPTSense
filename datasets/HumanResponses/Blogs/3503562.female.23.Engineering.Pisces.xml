      2 days ago an earthquake happened in north of iran and about 50 people diedand hundreds were injured.Most of us(who live in Tehran,Capital of Iran)filled it and became very scared.You could see fear in every faces .Houses in Iran are not well-biult and can't carry such a quake.The interesting part of all these happenings was the look of the people in the streets.you could see young women who were praying God ,with rosary in hands and kids in the other hands.Even children were asking God not to be killed in this way.And it just reminds me that , we all remember God in the hard moments of life Although we know he is always with us. God bless all quake -striken ones.

      Today i entered the world of orkut friends.It's realy interesting.The idea of making your friend's friend ,your own friend is something new i think.If you are already a member then you'll understand what I mean and if you aren't just let me know ;)

      Maybe you understand that i haven't written in my blog for a few days.The reason is my time which have been full(Is this sentence correct ?)I was realy busy and tired .The worse is my fault which I made at work.Although my boss didn't say anything or at least pretend to it but It was very bad and made me nervouse.Hope these days finish . Last night we went to Farahzad,one of cool resorts in Tehran,to eat dinner.If you have ever been there you can imagin beds which people are sitting on them and eating tea ,sour milk ,kabab , Dizi .... and smoking, specially GHELYUN which is something like an intertainment for Iraninas. It was amazing seeing that there is no GHELYUN on beds.The owner said it is illegal.None of us used to smoke so it has no difference for us but i know lots of people who like it and look at it as a habbit not addiction instrument . I think this decision isn't true.If our police wants to stop smoking ,it must stop delivering addictives ,not GHELYUN which isn't very dengerous.

      Some days ago, I was going home by bus.It was one of those hot summer days.After a while an old lady got on.From the first step of the bus she started cursing all the passengers.I think she was mad or not in a well-built social situation. She shouted and said she would smash anybody who comes near to her and surprisingly, everyone tried to keep the safe distance!!! None of the passengers was courageous enough to stop her.Maybe it happened because they don't like having any trouble , so they all let her curse all of them. When we expand it to a big society like a country,we'll see if the people of that country are this much conservative which don't criticize any wronge incident, then the leaders and government of that country would do anything they want and sure enough that nobody dare to say anything. What do you think? ;)

      Yesterday & today are the longest days of a year.During these days we see sun flames more .Ancient Iraninan was in the conviction of getting more goodness from the sun in such a day. They even said if somebody have been born at this day he will be a loyal and honest human because he has the least devilness in his soul.They looked at the sun as the most powerful source of energy and life so they do some traditions for it.  What's your idea to step just about 2000 years back and have a look on their behavoiur at such a day? :D

      Today i heared about something nice. Is that true which most of us like to get kindness more than giving it to the others? We usually expect people to be kind enough to us ,say hello , shake hands, even bow , ask about our children health , about our spouse works ... to show that we are important enough for them to pay such a time. But have you ever wondered that if you do the same with others!!!Is their illness,problem , quarrel ,... and all tehir unusual matters  in the same importance with what you want from the others? It's obvious that if you want to earn something you must pay for it and the  price of kindness is kindness inadvance. ;)

      From the moment internet come to our home ,gradually takes book place . Unintentionally , I gave my book reading time to amazing windows of World Wide Web .Nowadays I even read newspapers via the net , a usual work for these times . Possibly you wonder why she is talkingabout it.I just want to say one thing and it's this :"If you are like me , very addicted to gaze at the monitor , just give yourself a chance to READ A GOOD BOOK and get sucha  misse dcomfort especially at the end of the day."And if you are thinking why I am saying about it ,your answer is very simple :D Yesterday when I reached home I found that the electricity is off so I wasn't able to do anything but reading!!!

      Yesterday we were invited to someone's home.I like them very much so woke up very excitedly in the morning. I collect some souvenirs from our last trips for them and then make go . When we gpt there I found a cold environment all over the air. I gave the host's daughter my gifts but no thanks!!!She paid no attention to me.She even talked to me very rarely, just the moments she needs something.This kind of behaviour at first, made me very upset.I was realy ready to cry . But after some moments I thought if she wants not to talk with me it's her problem.SHE will lose the chance of chatting ME ,so the person who should be sorry is her not me. After this moment I found a kind of relaxation in myself.I enjoyed all times of the party with others but her. We have a sentence in our religion which says"Act proudly to someone who acts proudly with you!" Last night will be registered in my mind because I learned a new way of thinking which helps me to enjoy my life more than before. What do you think? ;)

      We have a manager ,here at work, who is not favorite at all.None of the employers like to talk with him or do his works unless they have a must to do so. Yesterday, one of the collegues was talking about him and said that about 1 year ago when this favorite man!!!, was somewhere in the toilet :D , they ran into his room and deleted all his phonebook which was saved on his mobilephone. When I asked what would you say him if he asked the reason he answered we would tell him your mobilephone has some dangerous viruses and because he isn't very technical he would beleive whatever we say.So just guess what happened last year when he saw the empty memory.  Sometimes we are THE VIRUS ,not very harmful but very funny!!!

      Last night my father had a small operation on his back.At first he had decided to do it in Mashhad(our home town) but yesterday suddenly he made his decision and went to the hospital. I didn't know anything about it.He phoned from the doctor's office and said I'm going into the room!!!!I was really shocked.Our home is about 20 km far from there and Mehrdad (my husband) was going to be late.I know all of these are lame reasons for not going to the hospital ,so I was completely upset all last night.I promised him to come today and I'll certainly make it but at that time , when he needed me me I wasn't there.Even if he had told me yesterday morning I would definitly go there. My mom and brothers aren't here at the moment and he is all by himself.I'm really shy of myself but the time is gone and I missed last night when he needs my care. I don't know if you were in my shoes what would you do but some moments in life are so priceless which you cann't never ever back to them and remake them as you desire. At this tiem I don't want even to look at myself in the mirror . I don't want to face this unkind Somi!

      Once in a party a beautiful woman asked Albert Ainstine :"How good it will be if I marry you!" and then continued " I can see our son who is as smart as you and as beautiful as me." Ainstine though for a moment and then replied :" Please just close your eyes and see what will happen if he is as stupid as you and as ugly as me . "  Conclusion:Don't ask men to marry you because they really think they are SOMEBODY!!!!

      Has it ever happened that you say something and then understand you haven't thought about it before saying and it's been something wrong? Most of us usually do the same ;) so sometimes we unconciensly break a dear one's heart.It's compensation is much more harder than not making it.What do you think?

      Why do you like some films or musics more than the others?Maybe they are very good or you like their actress or player or you prefer it's gener. But sometimes you like something which is not popular at all. For example an old music or a film with just two players.It's not the film or music that attracts you but the memory of first watching it. Maybe it reminds you , your mom, friend etc , who you were watching it together or possibly he/she advised it to you. So while everyone say" What a terrible music!!!", you just get relaxed and have a nice smile during listening to it.

      Today i noticed to a wiered sound coming from the kitchen.When I looked to the source , I found a very nice incident.A couple of sparrows have chosen our air conditioner chimney as their house.They have filled it with little peices of wood and made it as a soft place for the female one to leave her eggs.When I saw it ,I felt a real happiness deep in my heart. I remember my chilhood which my parents always said if an animal chooses our house to give birth to her children then lots of good things happens for that family.We call it BARKAT in our language(Persian). I'm realy very thankful of my kind God for everythings that he has given to me and I'm ofcourse waiting for much more , because his kindness is unlimited. ;)

      Have you ever decided not to tell any lie for a day? Imagine you have gotten up. You look at the mirrior and say"OK , today I'm the most honest person in the world." and then get ready to go to work. At first your wife ask you :"Honey , what are you thinking about?" It's hard for you to tell the truth which you have been thinking about her grandma who were nagging all the last night party . So , you answer just "Nothing" and tell yourself I DIDN'T lie ofcourse . Then you step out and see your neighbor who is washing his car. You look the opposite to pretend that you haven't seen him , because you don't like him and ofcourse you haven't lied again. you go on and get to work . There is a form on the boared which is about selecting the best employer.You fill it and pass it to your boss and don't tell anything to your collegue because you are afraid of his selection , and still sure you haven't lied up to now. The day pass very quickly, It's a usual day that was supposed to be one of your best days. At the end of the day although you are still certain that you have been honest , but you don't feel any self-satisfaction and just wander WHY!!! What's your idea? ;)

      Sometimes when you look around to find somebody to talk about everything , you find nothing.have you ever felt like that? Today ,at work, I was in this case and unfortunately Mehrdad , my husband, wasn't available at phone.I was tired and need someone to be patient enough to listen all my words , but i found nobody there.Although my colleuges are very respectful but it was like this.I was far away from them.

      Today i read about a chinease astronomer who has predicted a nearly earthquake in Tehran.Like before i was frightened agained and pray to God not to make it.The astronomer predicted the quake out of the shape of the clouds which are over Tehran .They say he had predicted Bam earthquake which about 40000 people died . He said the percentage is about 68% . You see,it's come very near ,it's more than possible ,it's coming to almost. We,people living in Tehran, know this situation but still keep on living like before . Maybe because we love living ,and it's my main reason to be frightened.i cannot say there is no difference.YES there is.I love living with my parents,Dear husband,friends,colleuges and everybody who i meet everyday in the streets,shoppings ,etc.And I ask The omnisience God not to leave me alive when my dearest ones are death after the quake. How sweet is living with your beloved ones!

      once up on a time a wise man's friend came to him and said I want to inform you of some amazing news. Man thought for a while and answered :"Is there any benefit of the news for me?" He answered : "No" Then he asked again : "Are you sure of what you are saying?" He naswered again :"No" For the third time he asked:"Is there anybody who doesn't want me know about it?" He said:"yes" After a moment the wise man answered " so why are you flattering news which are not good and you are not sure about them and some body hurts if I know them?" Man stayed silent and keep on going.   And the wise man never understood that his best friend had sex with his wife!!!

      What do you do when you&nbsp; are listening to someone who is gossipping ? I hate persons who don't have anything to say so start talking behind someone who isn't available to&nbsp;prove himself. I think the best way of stopping these persons is saying frankly not to continue anymore.Some days ago&nbsp;I did such a thing&nbsp; and that person become red out of her anger up to her ears.It was really funny when she heared&nbsp; it and didn't talk up to the night. It made me feel better .What do you think?

      Today I want to talk about the&nbsp;way of this nice lake.  First of all you need to have a good friend from Dorood :D ,the city near there.I'm kidding but it's recommended that you go to Dorood and sleep one night there and then wake up very early in the morning (about 4 o'clock) to climb the mountain , because season of traveling there is summer and in this time you mustn't walk under the sun.  It's about 45 minutes to get from Dorood to the main road of&nbsp;the&nbsp;lake by car.When reaching there you should hire some mules to carry your goods( food, tent, sleeping bag,...) and then a very nice road is in front of you.  Atleast ,you should walk for about 3.45 hours to see the first scenes of&nbsp;the lake , but the road itself is very nice.you can find lots of springs near the way and the sound of the river and the wind blowing there is really calming.  Now you are there.I'll describe it more very soon.

      Last week we went to one of the most beautiful resorts of Iran, called Gahar Lake.this lake is between the Zagros mountains and it has sweet water and you can see kinds of fishes which just live in this situation. Later I'll talk more about the wayof reaching there and the place. But something that I want to mention here is that nice group who helped us to see these nice sineries . They were one of my college's family , very generous , very hospitable and very skillful at traveling in such a way .We were together for 3 days.  The nice part of this family was their old mother who is about 56 years old and comes step by step&nbsp; all the way with us and cooked lots of delicious food there.

      Generally speaking ,people falls into 2 categories.One &nbsp;of them do whatever they like to do and the others do whatever the others expect them to do( Is it clear?:D).Which category do you prefer ?  The first group have an independence mind to let them don't pay attention to the others opinion &amp; do what makes them feel comfortable.In this case sometimes they seem impolite because the other ones think they don't listen to them.  In the other hand there is that so-called kind &amp; nice group which have been born just to listen to their friends &amp; do their suggestions &amp; ... To avoid making them angry.  I prefer kind of moderation, because sometimes the first ones are rude and proud of themselves &amp; the second ones are weak and foolish who don't consider their own necessary needs.  But unfortunately , most of the times I fall into the second group &amp; because I dare not to make someone unhappy I do as he/she likes.  What do you suggest me , to stop this bothering behavior?  Thank you.

      First of all I owe anybody who visits this blogs daily, one apologize for delay of updating it. These days were somehow busy ones. And I want to mention that this blog isn't going to be a place for writing my dairy but somewhere for ideas ,happenings,news and everything that I feel useful to talk about with you. Last two days I was invited to a seminar which was about making your network as much secure as you can to keep your data for your own and don't lose it.They gave a nice example to show the necesity of doing that which you can see it here. All of you have heared of MercedecBenz company which is the largest and luxerious car producer in Germany.They pay tax for each car they sell, to the government.About 3 years ago tehy started advertising a brand new model.When everyone were waiting for this release ,surprisingly, they saw it looks like the new models of Mitsubishi.So it wasn't something especial for car fans and wasn't been sold as they predict , and the government didn't get the income of taxes they were waiting for and the company face to some serious problems. It's easy to imagin what had happened .They hadn't done certain protection of their data and Mitsubishi was the company who do benefit of it :D

      When two people get married they start a life under a ceiling. Maybe they had been in love before the marriage or no , they'd just find each other suitable so decided to get married and then gradually find the certain love. If they live for 1 , 2 , 5 or 10 years it can be a sign of successful selection .I think after this time even if they hadn't been in love but they had get used to this life. And the worst part of these couple's life is when one of them pass away, it will be almost impossible for the other one to continue. Because of all these reasons and because I do love Mehrdad I prefer to live as long as he is alive . Possibly , you say it's very soon for you to think of this matter but yesterday was the first day that I didn't meet him and it was terrible.

      Once upon a time , there was a little princess living at the end of the world , waiting for a handsome prince riding a white horse , to come and kiss her , to become her husband and make her a happy life. There was a monster living near around who , despite of his devil appearance ,was very kind and generous. One day while he was passing around the castle , by chance he saw the princess and from the first glance he felt in love with her , but he wasn't the man with white horse and ... Yes , you are right .This is the first part of a realy nice story of Disney company , named "SHEREK" . I gratefully do love this cartoon and it's look to the legends which are never old-fashioned. What do you think? ;)

      I don't like to write about political problems in my blog and I won't do it , but some of incidents have been hacked on every Iraninan mind which we can rarely forget them . One of these tragic happenings occured 6 years ago on 8th of July (18th of Tir). We all know what happened at that tiem so it's better not to review it. About 15 years ago when the chinease government killed lots of students in Tiananmen square in Beijing, because they were criticizing their way of rulling the country , I thanked God that we are living in an Islamic place which wouldn't hurt it's own citizens out of tehir way of thinking. But nowadays ,all of our brilliant & genius minds are looking for a way to run out of this damn place to live in somewhere where they can breath and think  and act freely as they want!!!

      Last night I was watching parts of a film called "Beyond the words" .Have you heared of it?Before starting showing that ,they wrote" We tremendously advice you not to see this film if you are under 18 or very softhearted." and you know, this sentence almost make me mad to see what they are presenting. It was about kind of Kordish people who are living in some parts of Iran,a documentary film.It starts with very beautiful sceneries of Zagros mountain in Iran and then has a look on the native people with those nice dressing, then gradually focus on some old men ,long haired and long beared( specially in white).They were going to have a wiered festival.  This ceremony starts with a kind of dance ,you round yourself again and again,everybody do the same to reach the certain moment,then someone comes and sit on a chair between them,and then another one comes and strikes a niddle with a hammer in his head!!!!but no blood comes out!They show it as a sign of savagery in Iran and at last they said " Look what a ... people they are" I have a friend who has done some researches on this type of life.I phoned him and heared some other things which was realy nice. He said these people believe in other forces which have effects on our life and they study on knowing them for years and after  a long time they reach to a point which they can say they can do such a thing.When that man is hammering on a head the other man si concentarting and getting help from that forces ,so he pushs his soul out of that certain part of his body,it results in no bloodshed and pain in his head and if he doesn't lose his concentartion nothing will happen ,but if just for a moment he thinks on something else then he will feel the pain and blood will come out and his brain will damage,maybe he dies. My friend said if you sit on that chair,you know all of these,  so you have selfconfidence that you can finish this match. This is one course of their school and their aim is getting nearer to our creator. Although I think it's kind of savagery but when I Listened to him I become interested on studying a little more about these forces.If we can't see them we can't say they don't exist. They are all around us and we are able to use them if we want.

      Tomorrow is the final of Euro2004 .I think you know that, this match is between Greece & Portugal(who is playing at his home). The funny part is that the bigging match of this cup was held between them too which Greece won Portugal, and now the last game is a review of it. During these two weeks which the competitions where going on , a great number of Iraninan men was late at work :D(Notice that ,not the women :D) because of the hour of the games which was near midnight. What's your idea? Who will win?Although Greece is very good but I bet on Portugal.Let's see the future.

      Today in Iran is Mother Day.It's different than the other countries so some lucky mothers who are not here in Iran celebrates both of them  ;) In our custome we go to our mothers home and spend our moments together, usually buy a gift for them to show that we always remember them and their works to grow up us,( This part is very interesting because husbands MUST give their wife a gift too:D Mehrdad always says"It's better to name this day: Mother,wife,mother- in- law day because poor men should buy gifts for all of them") But from the view point of myself today ,beyond all of the gifts and jokes and being togetehr, is just a reminder for us to thank this nice angel ,called mom, who really do whatever she could for her child and don't expect anything ,She is a fountain of love and one of the best things that God give us. I do appreciate all mothers of the world.Happy Mother day.

       Ok now you are there. I'm sure that you are very tired so you cann't see around very good.You are just looking for a suitable place to place your tent and then making some tea. A good point of traveling tehre is that you can find sweet water everywhere.It's so cold and tasty. After resting for about 1 hour ,you have 3 days in front of you to go round the lake and enjoy every minute.During day you can go swimming and fishing and in the afternoon you can just sit lazily in your tent and play card. You should collect woods in the afternoon if you want to make fire at night.It looks very nice ,seeing flames of fire in front of those colurly tents everywhere in the lake beach. If I want to make this long story short ,into some words, it's bettre to say you can enjoy of the nature in a very memorable travel by trying tehre.
