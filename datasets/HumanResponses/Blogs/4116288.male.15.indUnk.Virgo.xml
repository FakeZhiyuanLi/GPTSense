       Hi everybody. I haven't written anything in quite the long while so I'll give you a week update on my life. This has been a pretty fun week and it will probibly only get better. First off, we went to Warped Tour! It was so much fun. I moshed to Billy Talent and came out looking like a friggen zombie or something like that. We also saw a lot of other good bands, and most of the time I was thinking "One day my band will be up on the stage playing infront of tons of people". Before Warped Tour me, Chris and a couple of his friends went and saw AvP (Alien versus Preditor). I'm telling you non-belivers right now, It's a good movie! Now all I have to do is watch all the other Alien and Preditor movies. The rest of the week was pretty basic but still fun. I'm also looking forward to this weekend because it's Leigh's birthday and we will be going paintballing. It's like the two best things in the world, number one, shooting stuff without actually causing much physical damage (belive me... if guns didn't hurt I'd so be American) and number two, funky colours everywere. We are also going to see a movie tonight so that is something to look forward to. Ya... sorry for not putting this all in cronological order and making it harder to read. I just write stuff off the top of my head and now you can all see this. Thats about it and I shall write my next blog soon.

      Ok, I saw the worst movie in the world, and if you haven't guessed already, the name of the movie is Open Water. To watch it would be to make your I.Q. drop a lot. Watching it has now made me, my friends (Emo, Robbie, Vicki, and Leigh), and everyone in that theater dumber. I can no longer do basic math. If I were to fail any school subject, I could just tell the teacher that I watched Open Water and they would be like "Oh my god!!! What did you get on your reportcard? 30%? You still got 30% after watching that movie!? Wow that's amaizing... That should atleast be upgraded to 90%!!!". Infact it was SOOOOOO BAD that I'm actually taking time out of my "busy schedual" to write about it.  WARNING: DO NOT read past this if you DO NOT want the movie OPEN WATER to be SPOILED for YOU!!!  It all starts with a guy and a girl talking about going on a vacation and them first going on the vacation. Then they are in the motel room being all sexual and the guy is all like "Hey, have sex with me" and the girl is all like "Naw, I'm not in the mood" This is probibly the highlight of the movie considering the girl is naked and it doesn't hesitate to show parts. Then they go scuba-diving and stay under the water too long and there is a miscount and blah it has to do with some idiot screwing up the other idiots "foolproof" method of counting which, is every time someone comes on the boat he scratches a pen on a paper till he gets to 20. Ok this is the first part that pisses me off, instead of that you say "Look to your left... then to your right... know the faces of these people for the count at the end". Then they come up and see that there is no boat around them and the only boats they see are far away. So the girl says "Lets swim to one" and the guy says "Oh no, we can't do that. That boat might not be are's and then they would get all worried and wouldnt know were they are". Then for about 30 minutes it's random floating with sharks and jellyfish around them. (Insert soundtrack here?) Not a chance. There is only about 10 minutes of music in this movie and it's random monks humming (and you don't even get to see the monks!) Then something finally happens. A shark bites the guy and he freaks out. They tie some random thing to his leg to stop the bleeding and everything is fine... FOR THE MOMENT! It turns night time, sharks attack the guy, he dies from bloodloss or something, and she takes off anything that is holding her over the water and sinks. In the middle of this whole ordeal, they find out that they are missing and go looking for them...... THATS IT! There I just saved you about an hour and 15 minutes of your time. If you think it sounds stupid being typed, it's even worse to watch. Warning: this movie may contain scenes of really bad acting. Ok I really don't care what you say, if you have been floating around in the water for 2 hours and u seen boat you wont just wave your hands and do a random whistle. You would scream your fucking ass off and flail like a madman. And that would be my review/ the basics of this movie.

      I'm feeling sort of...depressed? I guess thats what it is. It's cause my band hasn't practised in a while and we don't practise all that much and I totally look forward to practise when I'm told that we are going to. Right now I feel like performing on stage, or making a demo tape, or musically achieving something with my band. I want to be like "Ya... thats me and my band" and the other person will be like "WOW YOU GUYS ROCK!". Being even moderatly depressed for a little while of the night sucks for me because I'm Mark... I'm almost never depressed. Anyways... onto another note I have something to talk about that involves friendship. See, today I witnessed something that happens a lot between friends. See we were supposed to go to her bestfriends house at like 5:00 but I invited friends over and we wer having a really good time so by the time we got there it was 8:00 and she has already gone out (and this part was mostly my fault). *oops* a mistake, something that humans make all the time. So they get in an argument on msn and my girlfriend (being the nice person she is) appologized her ass off until her friend finally accepted it. Then today her friend invited her to sleep over and we were all heading in that direction so we walked her. She got there and her friend wasn't there. So we hung out for a while and she went back. It turns out her friend still wasn't there and she had to walk pretty far home and she met her friend on the way and she didn't even care. So for everyone out there... FRIENDS DON'T GET BACK AT FRIENDS!!! It's just totally wrong, it makes people feel like total shit and friends don't do that to eachother. People have done this to me before and I know exactly how it feels. just remember that the next time that your thinking "Hey they did it to me".

       Today I felt like writing something but I wasn't sure what to write about. My girlfriend (Carly) told me to write about pink fluffy bunnies and Jesus when I asked her, but once again my mind wanderd and I rememberd that we watched the funniest movie ever today. First, I must tell you why I find this movie so funny. You see, it all started when I was born in Canada. Because of this I was raised thinking that Americans are stupid. Everyone around me told me so when I was little and then the media justified it as I got older (mainly because I am a pacifist). If you haven't already guessed the movie, it's Bowling for Columbine. This movie basically shows a bunch of Americans saying stupid shit about guns and gun control. This movie seems to have been made for Canadians to laugh at Americans. If you are a patriotic American, DONT WATCH THIS MOVIE! It will probibly make you want to shoot Micheal Moore at which point he would say "I told you so". All I'm really trying to say is this movie proves to me that a lot of Americans are fucked up. Don't get me wrong though, I am not saying that every American you see is either stupid or just and asshole. I'm just saying that a lot of them are, but I do know some kool Americans. Either way... I figure that no one is reading this let alone Americans. O ya and IF you read this and happen to be American. Just remember that if you write a comment along the lines of "I'm gonna kill you and your whole family" or anything like that, then you aren't thinking before you act because you would have read the "not all of them are either stupid or assholes" part and thought fair enough, and therefore you are futher digging a steriotypical hole for yourself.

      I feel very weird at the moment... its 12:46am at the moment and i feel like it's the middle of the day. Like if I were to open the window it would be sunny out. I don't know how many of u would get exactly how weird this feeling is but it's weird enough for me to be writing about it. It also sucks because now I want to do stuff that I normaly wouldnt do at night like hang out with my friends or play my bass guitar. O well...  So ya today was pretty ordinary for me. I hung out with my friends, watched a bio on Donald Trump with them (lucky bastard), played monopoly and then went and played some pool. All and all a pretty good day. On another note, I NEED MONEY BAD!!! Lately, I have been living off of my friends and parents and it makes me feel like such crap. I feel so needy and then I ask my friends for money and I feel like they are thinking *god damn it* and then saying "Ok Mark".  I need to be/ feel more independent. Luckily I am pretty much garunteed a job at IGA in September, but even that isn't as good as it sounds because I am only getting it cause one of my friends work there! Once again I am forced to rely on people. O well I guess I'll just take what I can and live with it.

       Hi, this is Mark F... I'm not going to release a full name cause thats just how I am. I decided to start a Blog because when I dont have much to do (being pretty often), I read my friend/ guitarist's (Chris Rodger's) blog. So I thought "why not make one myself". So far today has been really really boring, and all I can think of is practising with my band *tear*. However like every other day, I tried messeging Chris and he didn't answer *shakes fist*. Above that everyone is doing something EXCEPT ME! But my gf is going to be home at 6 so I'll have something to do then :) and Robbie and Jessica will be home so they better call. That's about all I have to say on "MY FIRST BLOG" lol... hopefully I can update every couple days and hopefully people are reading this stuff so it doesn't feel like a waste.
