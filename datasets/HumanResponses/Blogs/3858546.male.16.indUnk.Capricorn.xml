      I'm bored. I keep thinkin about this girl that lives in town. I don't really know her, and yet, it feels like I know her. That's confusing. Well there's a lot going on in my life no one knows about. Then again no one knows anything about me. People think they know me, but there's really another part of me that no one ever sees. A side that's really nice, funny, not the side everyone sees, serious and business like. I like being myself, but I've raised an image that everyone thinks I am. And I'm not. There's only one person that my real self comes out around. When I'm with her I feel I can be me, and not the me i've made myself to be. Sometimes I believe i'm the person I'm not, and just need someone to hang around with so I can forget about it. Right now what I need in my life is just something more. Not a relationship, but a true friend. Something that's hard to find anymore.

      A couple weeks ago I met this girl named Brittney. I can't tell you enought about her. She's beautiful, has a great personality, and a great smile. She's been through a lot in her life, but so have I. I don't like to rush into anything, I really want to get to know her. We have a lot in common, from music, to beliefs in many subjects. She's working on college as a junior in high school, which is what I had thought about doing. She's suppost to call me tonight. I hope she isn't getting drenched by the rain. It started raining just a little bit ago, and she had said she was going to visit a friend. I was going to go see her tonight, but I'll probably try to see her tomorrow. I don't really want more than a friendship at the moment, but I want to be good friends. She seems to be someone I could spend a lot of time with. Right now I think that's what I really need in my life, someone to spend time with. Brandon is ok, but he's too self centered. It's sad that all i've thought about the last couple weeks is Brittney. Everyday I think about her, and I don't know what to do. I think about her smile, and it keeps me up at night. I was depressed last night, and I think it was because I hadn't talked to or seen her for a little over a week. I talked to her last night, and I really wanted to go see her, but it started to rain. I probably could have went earlier today, but I didn't know she was off of work. I really need a job, I applied at a place called Denier Electric in Columbus, but i've heard nothing back. If I don't hear anything by next week, I'm thinking about going to Wendy's. Brandon and Brad work there. And Brandon says it's easy, plus I love to cook. So I guess it would be OK. The whole time I type this, all that goes through my mind is Brittney. She's been through a lot, and I would never hurt her. But I don't know how to tell her that. I'm not good with expressing my feelings. Plus I really don't wanna rush into anything. I'm afraid if I do it'll end up like my one friends last girlfriend, which lasted 6 days. All because they rushed into it. I really can't express how much I like Brittney. I wouldn't say love, 'cause I don't know her that well. But lets just say I like her a lot.. We'll leave it at that. Well I think i'm going to wrap this up. Want to get to bed early tonight.
