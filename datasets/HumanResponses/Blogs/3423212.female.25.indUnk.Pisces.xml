      Speaking from real life experience, mould does not taste like anything. In fact, the particular greenish, disgusting fungus has a taste so mild you will not be able to identify it, especially in between mouthfuls of ham and cheese, until you actually see the greenish, disgusting fungus.  In other words, you will have absolutely no idea that you are munching mould(y bread) until you look down on a bright Monday morning and notice a whole colony of mouldy spores, residing on the bread you are currently eating, peer back at you.   Other than the whole disgusting relevation, mould really does not have any taste on its own at all.

      Isn't it amazing how quickly an online journal can be created? It's like breathing life into a web address. From there onwards, crystalisation of memories begins here.  A little about how weird a person I am:  It is exactly 3.13am and I have just created my third online journal (at an amazing speed of 30 seconds!) and my washing machine is purring with laundry churning within (mine, of course).  But surely, you see the course of incidents that lead from one to another:  "I ran out of underwear" leading to "I need to get my laundry done" leading to "I wander around in the never-sleeping world of the internet" leading to "a sudden irresistable urge to blog on a website that allows me to host my pictures F.O.C" leading to "creation of wild_daisy's blogspot".  It all makes sense doesn't it?  Perhaps I'm not as weird as I think I am. After all, running out of underwear is fairly common...I hope.  Well, cheerios. My laundry is done. I must go do some hanging.

      Anything, for that matter! And I will bitch about my blurty web log, because it take a gazillion years to load, and it is always "stealing" my entries (i.e. failing to load when I try to upload my latest adventure and not returning my entries when I click "back")!!  By the way, I just realised that "entires" and entries" is only one letter apart. Not that "entires" is a word. I'm digressing.  Now, where was I? Oh yes, bitching about my blurty. The one which I have to click "refresh" a thousand times every time I click on a link. *Bah*  *******************************  Went out to dinner with Ning today and we yakked for three hours over crappy Italian food and coffee.   That's not the highlight of this entry, though.  The real highlight is this girl who sat beside me in the MRT who was talking on her handphone all the way from waiting for the train to the time I got off.  I didn't really mean to eavesdrop...she was loud. Anyway, she caught my attention when she said "...well, not that I don't know you, but knowing someone on the phone and knowing someone in person is different."    Yeah, like it's a big deal.  Anyway, the transmission was really bad because we were travelling in a tunnel, so she got cut off 5 minutes into the train ride. At first she reacted the same way as most of us would--to start shouting repeatedly in the phone (hello?! HELLO??!! CAN YOU HEAR ME??!!) as if volume is the whole problem. Well, it wasn't, and she realised that after the fifth "HELLO?!" staring at the phone in a mixture of disappointment and disbelief.   And then she started singing.   Yes, right in the train, beside me, like me and 50 other passengers did not exist. She started singing this really sad mandarin song rather mournfully.   I stole a look at her from the corner of my eyes and accidentally peeked...ok, so I peeked, at her handphone which had two lines of the lyrics on it. I was fascinated and a little shocked...because she started singing louder.  Unfortunately for the girl, her chatline friend had to get through to her phone and break up the mini concert she had intended to hold. She went on to talk about selective flirting and whether the way they chatted was considered as flirting. Four stops down, reception was down again.  Naturally, she started singing again. Gaining momentum very quickly, she broke into a song, her legs stretched and head leaned back and gazing mournfully at the ceiling of the train, she lashed out another sad song like a lovesick puppy.  You must imagine how hard it was for me to pretend that I didn't hear anything, and that she was just another ordinary co-passenger, taking a light snooze beside me, I looked with great interest at the other passengers' buttons and shirts, and at the reading materials they have on hands. But she was singing so loudly.  Thankfully, I got off one stop after she started singing at full force. Believe it or not, she was still singing (and glaring hard at her handphone, willing it to ring) when the train doors were closing. I hope her little friend calls soon.
