      i feel like writting but i dont kno wut to say..i feel like all the greatest quotes in the world have been stolen  " life is a box of chocolates " - who said that anyway..forest gump lol  "To fear love is to fear life, and those who fear life are already three parts dead." -Bertrand Russell  "Freedom is not worth having if it does not include the freedom to make mistakes." -Mahatma Gandhi  *damn i wish i wuz as smart as him.  "This isn't good or bad. It's just the way of things. Nothing stays the same." -Real Live Preacher  "Electricity is actually made up of extremely tiny particles called electrons, that you cannot see with the naked eye unless you have been drinking." -Dave Barry   i wonder if the people that said these quotes ever thought theyd b recognized fur wut they said.

      mood: inspired and very lazy  i hate myself right now i wish i could study.I wish i could get drunk and pass out, then wake up the next morning and not care what i looked like. I really shud study fur math...but i cant i dont have enough will power fur it i guess.I understand nothing in school xcept fur may b fine arts,.. lucky me im in foods.. Why do we do things we dont beleive in..every time i have a birthday cake, see a shooting star i wish, not one of these wishes come true, and every time i feel dissapointed, but i still do it, this scares me do i not learn frum the mistakes i make...? Y do i collect bottles and put them in front of window, and those jones bottle caps " stop smoking"..right. I hate having high expectations, but i always do. I hate when people dont keep theyre promises. I hate my parents. I hate not ever going to disneyland. I hate fairy tales but i like happy endings. I hate hating. i hate myself sometimes.I hate when after a shitty day your walking home and rain starts stabbing at your fucking back.I hate having a curfew. i hate moodswings. I hate wasting time on sleeping.I hate holding on to things. I hate not being able to admit things. I hate not knowing how i feel.  Melancholy smells like the smoke coming from my blow out birthday candels. its exactly then when i feel a little part of me dissapear.  forever.

      10. That actor who played the President was totally unconvincing Â  9. It oversimplified the way I stole the election  8. Too many of them fancy college-boy words  7. If Michael Moore had waited a few months, he could have included the part where I get him deported  6. Didn't have one of them hilarious monkeys who smoke cigarettes and gives people the finger  5. Of all Michael Moore's accusations, only 97% are true  4. Not sure - - I passed out after a piece of popcorn lodged in my windpipe  3. Where the hell was Spider-man?  2. Couldn't hear most of the movie over Cheney's foul mouth  1. I thought the movie was supposed to be about dodgeball
