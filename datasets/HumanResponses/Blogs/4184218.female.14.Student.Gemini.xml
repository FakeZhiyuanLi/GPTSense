      I decided to get one of these instead of a Xanga since the site kep freezing p my computer. Here's my xanga incase you wanna know some oher stuff: www.xanga.com/roadtorejection143  I'll tell you whats been going on i my life. Ill start rom today and go back as far as i can..  Anyways.. something weird happened today. I s sitting at my computer and then the doorbell rang. Nobody was outside but I saw a bike inmy front yard. I went out on the porch and there was a bunch of flowers and a note. lmao it said "I'm Conner. I'm 14 years old but i'm veryshort for my age. I love you." lmao it was so hillarous My neighbor Kelly got one too. From the same kid. We hid in her car until we saw him and then talked to him. He looked like he was about 8. Lol. It ws crazy. He kept picking flowers from my neighbor's house and thowing them at us. It was crazy. That's it for today.. Andee is coming over later tho. We might go to SGC.  Yesterday.. I did absolutely nothing except go to Borders and got a bo and the Ashl Simpson cd.  Sturday was a blast! Me and Bridgette (and her parents) took the train up to Chicago! We walkd to "Millenuim prk" which was pretty cool and we ate at some Mexican resturant that was really yummy lol. We walked to Sears tower and went up there. It was really pretty t night. we went to Navypier after Sears tower and stayed there. we rode the ferris wheel andKISS103.5 put on a fireworks show. It was cool. We walked around and like a gazillion homeless people asked us for mney. it was kinda sad.. then we rode the 1 AM trin home lol. Then we got some white castles lol.  Friday.. this is the last day i basically remember lmao. Went to SGC and saw my sexi steve! lol. played some DDR and thats about it lol it was really crowded.. mao oh and matt and kenny dressed up really weird.. it ws kinda funny i guess.  Thats all for now.....
