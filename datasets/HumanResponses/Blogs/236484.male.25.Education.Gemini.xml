        A pastoral letter issued by a Roman Catholic bishop in Colorado states that parishioners voting for officials supporting abortion rights be denied communion. The bishop also would deny communion for supporters of stem-cell research, gay marriage or euthanasia. -NPR (May 14, 2004)   Bishop Michael Sheridan of Colorado Springs is urging Catholics not to vote for Kerry (or any politican for that matter) based on the above. I'm not the first to pose this question  but what about declaring an unjust holy war the Pope himself formely denounced? Obviously Bush doesn't have to worry about communion but what about Catholic members of Congress such as Kerry, Jim Bunning (R Sen KY), Susan Collins (R Sen ME), John B. Breaux (D Sen LA), etc.. (information compiled from  urlLink Religious Affiliation of US Congress  and  urlLink Senate Roll Call: Iraq Resolution )?  With the 28% majority Catholic Congress we currently have you may imagine the list goes on and on. So what of them? Has the revolution finally arrived, albeit delivered from an unexpected side?

      Drummer  urlLink Elvin Jones died yesterday  (May 18, 2004). He was Coltrane's drummer for the original quartet (A Love Supreme, everything on Impulse!, etc..).  I can't help but remember the summer of 2001 when hearing anything of Jones'. It was  urlLink my bands  first tour. We hit the east coast and a bit of the midwest. My soundtrack was  urlLink John Coltrane: The Classic Quartet . It's an 8 CD box that I highly recommend to any classic Jazz fan.  If you have any of  urlLink Jones' Recordings  take a listen tonight, sometimes drums are ignored but not with him. . .

      After returning from a wonderful trip in Portland, OR I am caught in a whirlwind of complicated thoughts. They've always been there yet somehow managed to fester with each "free" passing day.  Mary (my girlfriend) and I have been enthralled with  urlLink Frontier  and the new series  urlLink Colonial House  on  urlLink PBS . It's a hard, desperate life but a great life none-the-less. Imagine a world were you really wouldn't have to worry about making bills. Imagine a world of real consequence, tangible gains, and true independence. Imagine a life so removed from the "everyday" that your mind could truly grow. It's a lot of work but separate from the mundane that work could finally be satisfying. I guess in some ways I share the ideals of  urlLink Diogenes , the only man  urlLink Alexander the Great  envied. Of course, I'm not really willing to go running around naked, speaking in only riddles and convincing every passerby I'm insane, at least not just yet.  I always joke with my cube mate John about moving to the mountains and painting all day. Or my other favorite is giving up cube life for a career as a Park Ranger. Trouble is, I'm only half joking. What can I say? I've read too much Kerouac not to see the benefits of a non-superficial lifestyle.  A high school friend found this life in the Air force. He lives in Germany off base with what he considers substantial freedom. However, I'm far too liberal for the military. I need other options. "Being my own boss" isn't good enough. I'd rather be my own world. . .

      I want to destroy my computer! Last weekend it decided to corrupt nearly all 40G of my mp3s. When I attempted to save 20G by copying files from my iPod (sorry Apple, but they're mine) it went ahead and corrupted those. However, before I discovered this I went ahead and synced my iPod deleting the originals. Now I have to re-encode ALL my cds and locate everything I "borrowed" from friends and downloaded (ATTN: RIAA, this transaction does not include any major label artists). Even worse, I think the file corruption is spreading. I ran every virus scanner I could get my hands on and couldn't find anything. I don't even know of any virus that could do this type of damage (at least not in OS X). Luckily, I managed to back up everything irreplaceably important. I feel like I'm on a sinking ship, throwing my possessions overboard, and just bidding time until the inevitable.  The G3 is over 5 years old. I have to face the grim conclusion that it's probably not ever going be as stable as it once was. I'd love to get another Mac but frankly, I can't afford one! So unless some charitable individual decides to grace me with a donation I have to act. . . I'm almost ashamed to say this but, I'm getting a PC. Don't get me wrong, I'm going to build one (or actually a coworker is with my input and cash, thanks Ken), but a Mac is simply not in my future. . .

      When you wonder why your taxes are so high make sure not to blame the liberal agenda. We weren't the ones guaranteeing lawsuits by using "under god" in the pledge. No, that was a red scare driven conservative scheme. We also didn't elect to use the death penalty which costs millions more in pleas than life in prison. I could go on with other examples of brainless conservative policies such as military spending (funny troupes don't seem to be happier now than when Clinton was in office) but let's leave that to another post.  There's three reasons to be a Republican; greed, Jesus, or ignorance. The fact that the center reason doesn't get along with the wings is just more proof that in most cases the latter is true. Let's just come clean here, conservatives are of a selfish mindset. They care only about they're bank book but don't seem to realize this book is stimulated by fairly liberal policies. Here's an example: Joey Greed moves out of a middle-class area because taxes are going up and blacks are moving in next door. He doesn't move too far, just a few miles north to a suburb. This new place is exactly like his old one but the taxes are slightly cheaper, and best yet, there's no blacks. Mr. Greed occasionally drives through the old place and notices quite a few abandoned homes, graffiti, liquor stores, etc... He also notices the once primarily white neighborhood is now entirely black. Things are obvious to Mr. Greed. This once beautiful neighborhood has succumbed to the dreaded minority disease: "Those people don't care about they're neighborhood!"  What Mr. Greed fails to realize is that he didn't "care about HIS neighborhood." If he did, he wouldn't have sprawled out leaving behind a significantly lower population with a significantly lower medium income and subsequently raising taxes. Now Mr. Greed's car occasional gets broken into, and once in a while he spots a "bum" stumbling out of the southern ghetto. He's thinking of moving again because the people in his neighborhood are talking of a tax hike to pay for improvements in crime prevention. Mr. Greed doesn’t like sharing. He doesn't think "those" people deserve his hard earned dollar. Yet, Mr. Greed loves Jesus. He's even got a fish.

      Conspiracy theories surrounding 9/11 aren't exactly few and far between but I can't help myself with this recent coverage of Skull & Bones.  File & Claw (another Yale secret society) supposedly broke into the Bonesmen "Tomb" back in 1876. They found documents of Illuminati origin. Some of you may be familiar with the Illuminati, basically they assume the conspiracy helm of nearly every war, tragedy, revolution, and major event known to man. They are the cream of the crop for conspiracy theorists. The Illuminati also adopted philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770-1831) theory of thesis, antithesis, synthesis. Briefly, this theory's meaning is; one wants something unattainable, one creates the exact opposite of that thing, one attains what once was attainable. For example:  Thesis:  More governmental control over the people; more money, more power, more influence.  Antithesis:  Sept. 11th 2001  Synthesis:  The Patriot Act, war on "Terror," war on Taliban, war on Iraq (access to the largest oil reserves on earth).   Ask yourself, would any of these "synthesized" events ever have taken place if 9/11 hadn't? Has the climate changes because of 9/11, or did we just happen to take notice of a climate already in existence? Better question: Would any of these "synthesized" events ever have taken place if Iraq didn't have the largest oil reserves on the planet?

        ...And while you may laugh at the idea that a secret society has members in high places who run the world, keep in mind that your next president will be either John Kerry or George Bush, both members of Skull & Bones, and both of whom refused to even discuss their shadowy connections to the group, including when directly questioned about it by Tim Russert on "Meet the Press." If they have nothing to hide, then why refuse to discuss Skull & Bones?     urlLink The Order of Skull and Bones

      This story is going to require a bit of background. My mother was recently laid off from her job at a photography studio. This layoff has brought her not only more time with her grandson (my nephew Brenden) but also more time with another of her hobbies. About a year back she reconnected with a longtime high school friend through email. Mona lives in Florida, she has since my brother was born. Mona's divorced, has kids and an alcohol problem. Since my mother's and Mona's reconnection she's been obsessed with this new discovery, email. She emails all her pals at work to complain about the boss. She grabs every cheesy poem, crazy chain letter, and offer from Microsoft for guaranteed millions to forward on to all the names in her address book. Luckily I'm not included in this transaction. Unfortunately, my girlfriend Mary is. Most emails from my mother require no attention at all excluding the delete button. A few days ago however, my mother sent the following. Keep in mind the subject handler was "have to read this" (I guess I should be proud that the subject wasn't all caps followed by a privy of explanation points).  I have not altered this message in any way, shape, or form!    Allah or Jesus?   By Rick Matts  Last month I attended my annual training session that's required for maintaining my state prison security clearence. During the training session there was a presentation by three speakers representing the Roman Catholic, Protestent, and Muslim faiths, who explained each of their belief systems, I was particulary interested in what the Islamic Imam had to say. The Imam gave a great presentation of the basics of Islam, complete with a vidio. After the presentations, time was provided for questions and answers. When it was my turn, I directed my question to the Imam and asked: "Please correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that most Imams and clerics of Islam have declared a holy jihad (Holy War) aginst the infidels of the world. And that by killing an infidel, which is a command to all Muslim, they are assured of a place in heaven. If that is the case can you give me the definition of an infidel?" There was no disagreement with my statements and, without hesitation, he replied "Non-believers!" I responded, "So, let me make sure I have this strait. All followers of Allah have been commanded to kill everyone who is not of your faith so they can go to heaven. Is that correct?" The expression on his face changed from one of authority and command to that of a little boy who had just gotten cought with his hand in the cookie jar. He sheepishly replied, "Yes." I then stated, " Well sir I have a real proublem trying to imagine Pope John Paul commanding all Catholics to kill those of your faith or Dr. Stanley ordering Protestants to do the same in order to go to heaven!" The Imam was speechless. I continued, "I also have a proublem with being your friend when you and your brother clerics are telling your followers to kill me. Let me ask you a question. Would you rather have your Allah who tells you to kill me in order to go tho heaven, or my Jesus who tells me to love you because I am going to Heaven and He wants you to be there, too?" You could have heard a pin drop as the Imam hung his head in shame. Needless to say, the organizers and promoters of the 'Diversification' training seminar were not happy with Rick's way of dealing with the Islamic Imam and exposing the truth about the Muslim beliefs. I think everyone in the U.S. should be required to read this, but with the liberal justis system, liberal media, and the ACLU, there is no way this will be widely publicized. This is a true story and the author is a well known leader in prison ministry.     Yes, despite the fact that I'm a staunch liberal/agnostic my mother is a conservative/protestant. At least that's what I'm discovering. Her interests in politics are slim-to-none. She never votes. She never talks about her likes or dislikes of any specific administration. She's never once declared herself a republican or democrat. Yet, she's a proud Christian and even prouder American! Actually, I think my parents were the first on their block to stick American flags on every item proving their declaration toward American consumerism. Hell, my mom even gave me a flag to display in my car window, "at a time like this you have to have a flag..." Thanks mom! OK, enough ranting. My thought has always been that there's nothing wrong with patriotism if it's targeted. The trouble is, my parents love for this country is like cannon fire on a foggy day. My mother distributing a message like this is not only scary because it's my mom but also because she, more than anyone I know, represents the archetypal white middle-aged American woman. The above message is what Middle-America believes. Not only do they assume this load of crap "story" of good-ol'-boy-meets-educated-Muslim-leader is true but they nod their heads in rhythm to its abhorrently misspelled joke of content.   Please America, listen to me. If you fancy learning more about Muslim faith read the Qur'an. Wouldn't you turn to the Bible if you were yearning for more education on Christian teachings? In conclusion I bring you a quote from myself, because after all, this is MY blog.  In times of confusion, turn not to random messages in your inbox, for they bring enemies of truth. Turn instead to substantiation. Celebrate your patriotism by devouring what is offered more in our America than any other on earth, corroboration of legitimacy. Turn to minds that may clear smoke with facts.  Post: After posting I found this  urlLink link  which may be of interest. . .

       urlLink       The INDUCE Act could be used to penalize any person or company who provides a device or service that could do anything to bring added value to intellectual property. The photocopier could illegally "tempt" its users to duplicate copyrighted material. Broadband providers could be held liable for "tempting" users to download songs. While established corporations might be able to withstand such lawsuits, entrepreneurs with novel, perhaps revolutionary technology could falter under the legal threats and expenses.

         I just noticed an interesting tidbit on  urlLink georgewbush.com  and  urlLink johnkerry.com . If you navigate to Bush's site and count each mention of Kerry (on the main page) you'll notice 5 specific instances of Kerry's name and 2 pictures (one picture includes vice president candidate Edwards). One of W's main menu items is even titled  urlLink Kerry Media Center  (You'll notice it's seven spaces down on the left). Upon clicking it a huge slew of Kerry bashing occurs.  Don't get me wrong, I'm not surprised by this at all. Election year campaigns have a long history of bashing-the-other-guy. The thing I'm surprised about is after browsing to  urlLink johnkerry.com  and counting the mentions of Bush (on the mainpage) my search ended quickly at 0. Of course, to be fair Kerry has a link in his main menu (six spaces down on the left) titled  urlLink D-Bunker  which is quite different from  urlLink Bush's Kerry Media Center  because it's dedicated to "D-Bunking" the Bush team attacks not starting them. Still, it's worth mention because it includes nothing but a slew of Bush mentions.  I would never expect a campaign to go without mention of the opposition. I just wanted to point to the fact that Kerry does seem to be running a very clean race as opposed to Bush. This might change as we approach November but as of right now I have to admit, I'm pretty impressed.

       Disney was the dominant political force behind the Mickey Mouse Protection Act of 1998, citing not fear for the company's continued profit-making–dependent on the gamble of continued innovation and creativity–but instead hiding behind a mask of defending "property rights." It should come as no surprise, then, that Disney cannot even manage to practice what it preaches. According to Reuters, "South African lawyers are suing U.S. entertainment giant Walt Disney Co for infringement of copyright on 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight,' the most popular song to emerge from Africa, the lawyers said on Friday." There should be no doubt now that Disney–and others in favor of extended IP–are motivated solely by corporate greed.  - urlLink FreeCulture.org   Do you believe if the original authors of Cinderella (Tuan Ch'eng-shih 850-60), Beauty and the Beast (Gianfranceso Straparola 1550-53), Pinocchio (C. Collodi 1881), and Snow White (Brothers Grimm, 1819) had copyright laws "protecting" their work Disney would even exist? Of course not, even those authors borrowed from ancient folklore to amass those stories. And that's the way it's supposed to be! Artists gain inspiration from many sources. Other artwork is a main reserve that should continue to be at an artist's disposal. How else would the art-world flourish as it has in the past without access to that history?  The origin of copyright is not the bastardized version the RIAA or Disney celebrates today. Protection of intellectual work dates back to 1710 with the Statute of Anne.   Whereas Printers, Booksellers, and other Persons, have of late frequently taken the Liberty of Printing, Reprinting, and Publishing, or causing to be Printed, Reprinted, and Published Books, and other Writings, without the Consent of the Authors or Proprietors of such Books and Writings, to their very great Detriment, and too often to the Ruin of them and their Families: For Preventing therefore such Practices for the future, and for the Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write useful Books. . .   This statute was clearly trying to protect an author’s work from being stolen by publishers. Quite a different coin than our current situation. . . I'd like to point your attention to the last line of the Statute, "for the Encouragement of Learned Men to Compose and Write useful Books." The heart of this line lays in the encouragement of the art community not the discouragement. I mean, would you have confidence as an author if you knew once a printer got hold of your work it would be mass produced without your consent or any profit? Or, what confidence would you have as an artist if you could barely make $.50 on a $16.98 sale?  It looks to me like the novel idea to protect artists has gone an entirely dissimilar route, don't you think?

      I can't do it! I can't willingly support John Kerry. This man voted us into the war and The Patriot Act. He passed Tax cuts for the rich. He's condoned nearly every agenda Bush put forth during this term. Just look at his stance on Iraq, "We need to get the UN more involved." What the hell do you think Bush is doing? Now that it's a sovereign nation the UN is pledging to assist Iraq both administratively and militarily. How would this war be any better with Kerry (a guy that voted for it and follows Bush step by step)? I don't see it. . . Please enlighten me, because I hate Bush just as much as the next tree huggin' liberal! But I'd rather not just replace him with another Bonesman. . .  On a side note: I just got my new computer and can't wait to tear into some new projects. Thanks again Ken for dedicating so much time to helping me out!

        Saddam was a good guy when Reagan armed him, a bad guy when Bush's daddy made war on him, a good guy when Cheney did business with him and a bad guy when Bush needed a "we can't find Bin Laden" diversion.   Trade with Cuba is wrong because the country is communist, but trade with China and Vietnam is vital to a spirit of international harmony.    The United States should get out of the United Nations, and our highest national priority is enforcing U.N. resolutions against Iraq.   A woman can't be trusted with decisions about her own body, but multi-national corporations can make decisions affecting all mankind without regulation.   Jesus loves you, and shares your hatred of homosexuals and Hillary Clinton.   The best way to improve military morale is to praise the troops in speeches while slashing veterans' benefits and combat pay.    If condoms are kept out of schools, adolescents won't have sex.   A good way to fight terrorism is to belittle our long-time allies, then demand their cooperation and money.   Providing health care to all Iraqis is sound policy. Providing health care to all Americans is socialism.   HMOs and insurance companies have the best interests of the public at heart.   Global warming and tobacco's link to cancer are junk science, but creationism should be taught in schools.   A president lying about an extramarital affair is a impeachable offense. A president lying to enlist support for a war in which thousands die is solid defense policy.   Government should limit itself to the powers named in the Constitution, which include banning gay marriages and censoring the Internet.   The public has a right to know about Hillary's cattle trades, but George Bush's "military" record (Texas and Alabama Air National Guard) is none of our business.    Being a drug addict is a moral failing and a crime, unless you're a conservative radio host. Then it's an illness, and you need our prayers for your recovery.    You support states' rights, which means Attorney General John Ashcroft can tell states what local voter initiatives they have the right to adopt.   What Bill Clinton did in the 1960s is of vital national interest, but what Bush did in the 80s is irrelevant.    Thanks Kim! Hopefully we'll be visiting sometime soon!
