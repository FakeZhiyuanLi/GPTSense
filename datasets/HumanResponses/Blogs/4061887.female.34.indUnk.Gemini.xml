       This is my 2nd or 3rd week working the night shift.  I don't know which, the days and nights are all running together and somehow I feel I've missed out on July.  I know I'm turning into a bona fide night person because last night my head didn't do 'the bob' one time, and I have the television line up memorized from Jay Leno the whole way through to 6am.   One thing that's cool is going home in the morning and knowing that although I'm headed for a nice round of the Today show and a nap, everyone else is on their way to work.  Suckers.  Night shift puts a serious dent in my social life, though.  Forget happy hour.  Forget meeting for lunch or stopping for a beer on the way home, etc.   It is nice to have the bed all to myself though.  No cover sharing or fighting over how high the air conditioner should be set.   Night shift sucks, but all in all it's an excuse to skip exercise.

       Today was a good day.  I went to a baseball game (just friends playing at a local field) and a house party.   I had FUN!  I didn't fight with my husband, and I had a Long Island Iced Tea.   Also, since I'm moving out the new house rule is that smoking is allowed throughout the whole place and not just confined to the basement and the front porch.  Yippee!  I'm really a non smoker, but lately I've been up to about a pack a day.   And all at the kitchen table!  I feel just like a new person.  The nicer my husband is to me, the more like sh#* I feel.  Reverse psychology?  How dare he!  I never thought I'd be divorced.  Pretty smug of me, huh?   Whatever

       So far August sucks pretty bad for me.   It's my own damn fault, I brought this sh** on myself.  September is not looking too good either.   Work was great tonight.  I love doing home health.  Some of the families are so great.  If I have to work, I choose there.  I guess since my husband slept on the couch last night, it's going to be my turn tonight.  Never will I ever get married again.  Ever.  They say 'never say never' but I'm saying never.  Sometimes I feel like the only person in the world.  The Effexor isn't working.

       My life is a big C.F.   I went out on Sunday and was minding my own business having a drink with my girlfriend when some girl (don't know her name) said that I said, "F%$# You!" to her.  I SO did not do that.  Anyway, her and her friends dragged me outside and beat me up.   Then I went to a bar down the street and got dragged outside and beat up again.  (Stupid)  Then I gave a friend a ride home and ended up kissing him and my husband saw it.   I am a mess.  What the heck is going to happen to me?  I'm very sore and looking for an apartment/divorce attorney.   I know I deserve the whole adultery scandal, but I didn't do anything to get beat up over.  Twice.  They beat my girlfriend up too.  I know things will get better.

       Where has the first week of August gone?  Did I miss it?  Hmph...  Summer rules!  I wish it could be August forever.  In 3 short weeks I'll be going back to class (full time this semester) and longing for these lazy, lazy days.  If fall goes as fast as summer, then I won't have a problem.  Yuck!  School!  As a person with no children, I am acutely aware of all the children's birthday parties I'm invited to.  Don't get me wrong, I like the little cuties, but enough is enough.  If I actually had a kid to drag to these things then I might feel differently.  No, I do not think it's cute when they do the crap they do.  No, I don't want to look through the stack of pictures you took at the zoo.  I just want to drop off my gift, eat the cake, and go home.  Thank you.  Children's birthday parties are the equivalent of birth control for me.  10 to 12 screaming brats on a sugar rush is just more than I can handle.  I like to stop at the bar afterward and drink one to my infertility angel.   That's all for now.  I'm off to Toys R Us to purchase another round of gift certificates.  What a terrible way to waste the precious little time summer has left....

       Girlfriends are just the best.  The longer I'm married, the more I appreciate them.  I used to prefer the company of guys, thinking that women were sometimes too catty, but my opinion has done a complete change.  Women rock.  And they have big hearts and strong minds and wonderful styling tips for hair.  They can tell you where the best place is to get your nails done, and when you say, "How was your day" you actually get a detailed answer and not just the usual, "It sucked"  Suprising that it took me 34 years to figure this out, but then again I've never been a fast learner.   Last night I went out to a local club with my husband and was the only girl there (except for the bartender) and got a sneak peek into all the goings on in the man's world.  It is not pretty.  They talk about women in an unflattering way, they talk about each other, and they gossip.  The worst thing is that during down time, they were talking about things like the difference between concrete and morter.  I wanted to open a vein.  No one had any fun, and then the night was over.  I had horrible nightmares all night.  No wonder.  The only redeemable thing was talking to my friend Ron today and realizing that there was still hope.  He is just like another girl to me.  Except bigger and sweatier and a husband and father.   I have to find some new places to hang out.

       It's Sunday once again and I find myself reviewing the misdeeds of the weekend.  Last night was the final night of 'Wing Fling', which is complete with beer tents, a band, lots of fun people and of course some tasty wings.  As usual I stayed out too late and probably drank too much.   Not much else to do in a small town.  It was fun while it lasted.  Sunday is supposed to be a day to relax, but I feel energized and ready to start a new week.  Must be cause I slept till almost 1pm.  This burst of energy does not mean I'm going to clean this pig sty at all.  Is it really August already?
