      Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am home again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am whole again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am young again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am fun again  However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you I will always love you  Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am free again Whenever I'm alone with you You make me feel like I am clean again  However far away I will always love you However long I stay I will always love you Whatever words I say I will always love you  I will always love you

      On a Monday, I am waiting Tuesday, I am fading And by Wednesday, I can't sleep Then the phone rings, I hear you In the darkness is a clear view Cuz you've come to rescue me  Fall... With you, I fall so fast I can hardly catch my breath, I hope it lasts  Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels OhhhhhIt's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me(x2)  I am moody, messy  I get restless, and it's senseless How you never seem to care When I'm angry, you listen Make me happy, it's your mission And you won't stop till I'm there  Fall... Sometimes I fall so fast When I hit that bottom, crash,you're all I have  Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me  How do you know everything I'm about to say? Am I that obvious? And if it's written on my face... I hope it never goes away...  yeah...  On a Monday, I am waiting And by Tuesday, I am fading into your arms... So I can breathe  Ohhhhh It seems like I can finally rest my head on something real I like the way that feels Ohhhhh It's as if you know me better than I ever knew myself I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell Ohhhhh I love how you can tell All the pieces, pieces, pieces of me...(x2)

      Hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption Winding in and winding out The shine of it has caught my eye  And roped me in So mesmerizing, so hypnotizing I am captivated, I am  Vindicated I am selfish I am wrong I am right I swear I'm right I swear I knew it all along And I am flawed But I am cleaning up so well I am seeing in me now the things you swore you saw yourself  So clear Like the diamond in your ring Cut to mirror your intention Oversized and overwhelmed The shine of which has caught my eye  And rendered me So isolated, so motivated I am certain now that I am  So turn Up the corners of your lips Part them and feel my finger tips Trace the moment, fall forever  Defense is paper thin Just one touch and I'd be in Too deep now to ever swim against the current So let me slip away (3x) So let me slip against the current So let me slip away (4x)  My hope dangles on a string Like slow spinning redemption...

      So much for my happy ending...   Let's talk this over It's not like we're dead Was it something I did? Was it something you said?  Don't leave me hangin' In a city so dead Held up so high On such a breakable thread  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be...  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be But we lost it All of our memories so close to me Just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending So much for my happy ending  You've got your dumb friends I know what they say They tell you I'm difficult But so are they But they don't know me Do they even know you? All the things you hide from me All the shit that you do  You were all the things I thought I knew And I thought we could be...  You were everything, everything that I wanted We were meant to be, supposed to be But we lost it  All of our memories so close to me  Just fade away All this time you were pretending So much for my happy ending   It's nice to know that you were there   Thanks for acting like you care   And making me feel like I was the only one   It's nice to know we had it all    Thanks for watching as I fall    And letting me know we were done    &nbsp;  He was everything, everything that I wanted    We were meant to be, supposed to be   But we lost it    All of the memories so close to me   Just fade away   All this time you were pretending   So much for my happy ending...    &nbsp; Avril Lavigne- My happy ending... *hope he's happy at wat he's done to me...

But going out wif someone else is really unfair. so sorry. i really like u. but.. haiz,take care ok. "  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My tears juz started&nbsp;flowin instantly.. n i haf bn up since tat moment.. I am so heartbroken.. e one guy i truly loved was e one to hurt me e most,even more than anyone else ever did&nbsp;in e world.. he says its unfair to her ? but wat abt me ? dont i haf any feelings at all huh ? i wanted to call him names n juz scream n shout to let my anger out but i remained calm.. even tho i was hurtin so much inside n e pain was unbearable..  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Does he tink tat by sayin sorry, its gn change e situation n make me feel better n forgive him.. does he tink tat e pain he caused me will go away juz like tat.. wat e hell.. e day went by in a blur.. kept myself bz,channelled my anger into playin netball n went to werk aft a long day in sch.. n here i am..  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; so, it was all a lie, one big stupid lie tat i fell for.. e reply i gave him was " hmm.. wat can i say ? my guess was rite all along. which is y i tried to stay away from u at e beginnin.. but it happened anyways. haiz, life is so unfair.. tis always happens to me anyways so wat e heck.. im juz screwed. ive got nothin else to say cept tat i wish ya all e best n tat ill see u around ya."---> talk abt calm.. a fren commented tat i sounded like as tho ive given up. she's rite,i have.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he's so cruel.. playin wif my heart,messing wif my heart.. if he didnt care for me, y lead me on in e first place.. i shud hf juz gone wif my instinct n stick wif e fact tat he had a girl.. but i took tat stupid risk n now im hurt once more.. im to blame for my own sorrow.. why did he lie to me, he cud haf juz bn honest..  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; damn.. so many thoughts juz runnin thru my head.. i wasnt interested in him at all but i eventually gave in n he won my heart.. but now he has shattered it to pieces.. my heart will nv mend.. maybe guys r juz a waste of time.. im sealing my heart away.. so numbed.. so jaded.. why play wif my heart ad if u meant to break it.. ive alreadi bn hurt so many times.. sometimes i wished id nv met u.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he made me feel so alive but now it feels like a part of me has died... its hard to let go of somethin so precious,close to your heart but i guess tats e way its gotta be..  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life does go on but im sure if i can... maybe im not meant to be loved.. maybe im juz not worthy of anybody..

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh great..&nbsp;I juz deleted watever i had typed.. Urghh.. Skool juz started n im so stressed out. Not abt tat tho but HIM.. My noel.. I dunno wat went wrong wif our relationship.. Let me juz start from e beginnin.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was my senior back in sec skool.. We met online but nv reli talked at skool.. He was always surrounded by girls n i reli cudnt be bothered wif him.. He wasnt my type anyways.. He was rather flirtatious,wadya expect.. but i haf to admit, he had such a gorgeous smile tat he cud melt any girl.. anyways, lost contact wen he graduated.. tot id nv see him agn.. guess wat, i did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On June 21 '03, we met in a small alley(out of e many places here in singapore) at East Coast.. he couldnt even remb my name den.. but we got in touch n became close.. den i screwed it up by runnin my mouth n he disappeared.. i didnt reli care cos i got sick of him always bein so hung up on his ex gf.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, on May 23 '04, tat fateful day.. we bumped in e train.. i heard somebody shout my name,soundin so excited.. i wondered who e heck tat was.. i turned around, n der he was.. wif tat gorgeous smile.. Exchanged no n things juz took off from der.. we always met n hung out.. n in an unexpected twist of events.. he fell for me. i had told myself b4 tat i wud nv EVER fall for him.. so i kept runnin away, always in denial of how i felt.. i wanted him so bad but i also didnt wn end up hurt again.. ive bn scarred enuff.. But he got thru to me somehow n i decided to let my heart free.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It felt so perfect, juz bein wif him.. so comfortable.. he always makes me laugh n always keepin me happy.. he made me feel so secure, so loved, so wanted, so good about myself.. No guy has ever done tat or haf tat much effect on me like he did.. he's truly special to me.. but now he's disappeared once more n im so devastated.. y is he doin tis to me ? did i do somethin wrong ? was everythin juz a lie... ? y did god make me meet him only to let him slip away once more.. y is he bein so cruel.. ive got so many qns but no ans.. im so confused.. sms,calls.. none were replied.. it drives me insane juz thinkin abt it.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I JUZ MISS HIM SO MUCH...  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Imagine tis: Juz a day b4 it happened, we were out together.. Stil remb e time in e train.. id snuggled up to him,he hugged me, kissed me on e cheek n whispered ' i missed u' in my ear.. n e rest of e nite was perfect as well.. n suddenly, e next day, he's gone.. how wud u feel if u were me huh ?? Til today, i still wonder.. bn cryin.. hopin.. but im lettin it go.. ill juz wait.. wait til i fade away......

      At first I was afraid I was petrified I kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side But then I spent so many nights just thinking how youve done me wrong And I grew strong I learned how to get along And so you're back from outer space I just walked in to find you here with that that look upon your face I should have changed my fucking lock I would have made you leave your key If Id have known for just one second you'd be back to bother me. Oh now go, walk out the door Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh not I, I will survive Yeah, as long as I know how to love, I know I'll be alive. I've got all my life to live,I've got all my love to give, I will survive I will survive Yeah, yeah...  It took all the strength I had just not to fall apart Im tryin' hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart And I spent oh so many nights just feelin' sorry for myself I used to cry But now I hold my head up high. And youll see me with somebody new I'm not that stupid little person still in love with you. And so you thought youd just drop by and you expect me to be free But now I'm saving all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me Oh now go, walk out the door. Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore. Weren't you the one who tried to break me with desire? Did you think I'd crumble? Did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh not I, I will survive Yeah, as long as I know how to love I know I'll be alive I've got all my life to live I've got all my love to give I will survive I will survive Yeah, yeah…

My frens all tink he's a jerk, an ass but i juz cant bring myself to hate him ah.. only god knows how i felt abt him.. i had a talk wif gabriel a couple of days ago.. he said this 'sometimes when u've bn hurt too many times, it'll reach to the extend tht u cant feel anymore pain' and i agree wif him.. 'Maybe tis will help u to grow into a more mature person and so u can handle yr life easier when u get older..'. Not bad coming from a guy like him.. usually all he does is talk crap.. haha, no offense gab.. oops,gtg. later.       Ok, here i am back again.. hmm, gorgeous wasnt arnd today.. Wonder wat happened to him.. hope he's nt sick or anythin.. school was kinda exciting today(sorta). gt that case abt hui shan's stolen hp.. goodness.. i wonder wat e heck tat guy was thinkin.. everybody's bz(cept me, i was dead aslp) finishin e wishin tree n he goes around doin crappy stuffs.. haiz.. hope its settled.. gotta say tat i kinda look up to red now.. didnt knw he had tat in him.. tat honesty thingie.. nvm if u dont understand..      Anyways, tmr's e sch celebratin national day.. feel so lazy to come.. but i guess i shud anyways. to see a certain someone.. hmm.. wat ah.. haiz.. my mind's wandering back to him.. it shudnt be.. dammit, i hate myself sometimes.. but i'll relax.. what goes around comes around anyways so i'll le it be.. i'll be prepared when i do see him agn..      Btw, i juz remembered somethin.. saw city hall guy(i still dunno his name,he's my old crush btw) a couple of days ago.. coincidentally e day aft tis mess started n e last time i saw him was a day aft i met tat jerk... weird huh.. maybe i shud reli try n approach him..who knows.. =) he could be e one who'll make me forget ad.. i hope tat he doesnt start runnin away e next time tat i see him.. hehe..      And ive dropped the idea of bein a butch(lol). muz haf bn out of my mind.. thx alot to my frenz for knockin some sense into my freakin head.. i was reli thinkin of cutting my hair damn short n behaving like a guy.. but now i guess i juz wn go back to normal n juz get on wif my life.. life's too short to be wasted,dont u tink ? Whatever crappy stuffs i said i wud do were all in e state of temporary insanity.. i know ill nv get over it but im sure my heart will heal slowly over time..
