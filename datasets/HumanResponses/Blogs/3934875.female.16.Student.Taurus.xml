       hello.. i just got back frm dinner with my family. i went to town in the afternoon with nana. Nana! ur hair damn nice man!! I wanna cut like urs too..!! We met at arnd 2 plus and made our way.. Went to visit Linda at her Pizza Hut Centrepoint. For awhile onli.. Cos she had to get back to work after her break. When we reached the pizza hut, nana and me realised we were getting hungry even though i just ate b4 i went out! God.. Im piling on fast kilos.. Damn my metabolism rate! So we decided to walk to Far East's Sakura. One of our fave restaurants. There, i ate the usual tomyam claypot and nana ordered Thai Kway Teow.. Nice late lunch we had considering that we had our 'lunch' at 4pm. Hahaha.. After that,we went to take pics at the usual foto thingys.. During our 2nd pose.. Nana asked me to put on a serious pose. She had already put on hers and I was like laughing like mad cos i just couldnt put on a fake serious look!! I ended up laughing and she too! Cos my laughing is just too contagious. Had a crazy time with her inside the machine! God.. Then we made our way to Takashimaya. And.. we bought MUD PIES!! nono.. its chocolate pies.. Heavenly chocolate pies..! Taste damn gr8. We saw some performances outside Taka. This grp with lotsa diff drums.. And the ironic ting is that they were just promoting tea leaves frm Sri Lanka. Whats up with that? LoL. Nah~ Didnt see anyone familiar. Thats good.. LoL. It took my mind of him actually. But heck care,whatever. On the way home, which was realli early cos i had a planned dinner with my family, saw Ahmad who was making his way to school for a campfire. They wanted to gatecrash it.. As usual. Guess what? My family had dinner at Pattaya's Garden. Our usual family dinner place for Thai food. Damn.. I ate at Sakura for lunch and in just 4 hrs, im eating the same food. Not that Im complaining. Hehehe. I have to admit, Im born with a silver spoon in my mouth. =) Argh.. Couldnt eat much.. My stomach too bloated. Im gonna do my art folio later. Shld have started yesterday,but hurhur.. I got carried away.. I didnt do it at all. Fought with 'Awadh yesterday. Cos he bcame mad that i didnt sms him for&nbsp;43 days already. Haix.. U know,global sms now getting more expensive. How can i answer him that way? That would be downright rude. 'Awadh is Nana's cousin. Used to be frm my primary school but he moved to Malaysia when we were in primary 2 or 3. Yeah.. We sort of contact each other by e-mail or chatting every other weekend. He's a nice guy.. I cant deny that. When i told nana that he counted the number of days i didnt smsed him her reaction was like, " Itu sedara aku ker? " haha.. Nana, that is ur cuzin. Half smarty pants and half romantic.(Shh...) Hurhur.. His nickname for me is mangkuk and I call him pinggan. So thats settled and we're even on nicks. =)&nbsp; Well, 'awadh, if u read this, ( I dont think u wld aniway) im so sorry k.. I have my reasons. Blame it on him then. Ended what i had cos my pathetic feelings had to be for him instead. Hey..! Somebody, teach me how to add pics la!! Jepah.. faster!! I need pics on my blog here. And music too..!! Cepat la huzaifah..!! Aku nak pics &amp; music on my blog. Cepat!! Hehehehe.. Jepah my fren la.. The next Brad Pitt with the versatility to act as Neo frm The Matrix or just any typical flirty Casanova. Hahahaz.. Oritee.. I have to end it here. Wanna do my Art folio. Topic's on Death btw.. And im drawing myself potrayed as a soul in her afterlife clutching on to a poem of death dedicated to the one she loves. And hoping that with the help of the poem and an only candle&nbsp;,she might find her way to her next destination in midst of the dark.. Yeah.. Lame.. But I wanna do my best cos every mark gonna affect my end-yrs! Wanna get that 1st position la this time. Its not that nice to always being 2nd. So anyway.. I'll end it here for this Saturday. At least Im happy today. No solemn faces and sad feelings for the day. Except the morning part. Hehez.. Orite2 I'll stop here.Now.   Nitez.. =)   ~Put my soul on hold...Let it drop like my heart..Cos thats how u want it to be~

       Why must it rain at 5am ?? Couldnt go and visit yayi's grave today cos the place gonna get all wet and muddy..Not that i mind but my Dad does..Haix.. There goes my hopes.. Shattered as usual.. So i got up early... Nah~ was jesting.. Woke up at 5 and noticed it was raining.. So i went back to sleep. And i woke up again at 8.30.. Nobody at home.. I don't know where's everyone.. Oh.. My parents probably has gone for breakfast.. And my younger sis got school today.. Nowadays, theres only 4 of us whose usually at home.. Cos my elder sis sleeps over at my grandma's place to accompany her. U know,those pantang-larangs.. The wife cant go out of the house for 4 mths after her husband passed away. And my bro is in NS so of cos i dun expect him to be home... Bt he said he's gonna stay hme after August.. I dunno la the reason.. Or mebbe i forgot. So.. its like 10 am now.. And im going out later.. To town with nana.. And then i tink we're gonna meet up with zsa,yana,dayah and farisah. I tink la.. I still dunno what to wear on tues!! No idea. Oh yeah.. My bro gonna treat us to dinner today i think.. Aiyah.. why must today? Sebok onli lah.. Rite now.. Im listening to I Dont Wanna Know by Mario Winans. The other day, Khairul dedicated this song to me. I totally dont get it... Since when i cheated on him? Like i cared anyway. Guys are all the same. =) Nono, most guys are all the same. Hehekz.. So this song is like staying put in my head. Cant get it out. ~I dont wanna know, if ur playing me keep it on a low~  Cos my heart cant take it anymore~ Im not dumb ok,i can read the words for myself but wtf has that gotta do with me? Nono, Khairul's not my bfren ok.. I dun tink he ever comes close in having potential to be one too.. Hehehehe.. Gosh,that was harsh. Bleugh. Oh yeah.. I came across one of my poems just now. The one i wrote abt Rusydi. Who is Rusydi? He used to be my very good guy friend bt all that has changed when he chose to go back to his bloody ex,Ayu. But now, he's with another girl,and&nbsp;I talked to her over the phone the other&nbsp;day,and she sound real nice. Hope she wont break his heart. Yeah yeah.. Mebe i still like him.. but I gotta get realistic rite? =) He's just a friend. All i gotta do now, is to wait 4 prince charming to come and pick me up. Hahahaha.. Kiddingz. Unless that prince charming is at least 5cm taller than me (im 167 or 168cm aniwaes)&nbsp;and looks like Orlando Bloom then i'll eat my words..!Orites.. I'll update later. Meanwhile, I'll leave these words here.  ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,Cos thats how you want it to be...~  &nbsp;  C ya..

       As i heard the song "Love Me" by Collin Raye.. The country music just brought back nostalgic times to me.And the words..So deeply powerful.     &nbsp;  If you get there before i do,   Dont give up one me   I'll meet you when my chores are through   I don't know how long that'll be   But I'm not gonna let you down   Darling, wait and see   And between now &amp; then,till i see you again   I'll be loving you   Love me...    &nbsp;  You know,there was one point of time....A few days b4 my yayi (grandfather) passed away, he asked my grandma whther she loved him..It was quite loving to see such conversation between them cos I never in my life,saw them ever saying that they love each other.Well,my grandma told yayi that she loved him..And in fact,she asked him the same qsn.He replied in a flash " sayang..kiter sayang awak" in translation meaning that "i love..of cos i love you" I was quite amused and tickled to hear that..I learnt that you must tell one how much you love them..Before its too late. Oh yeah..he hugged me on the evening b4 he passed away. I didnt expect it to be our last hug.But fate is not written&nbsp;in my hands.Only God knows how deep my regrets are for not asking him for forgiveness before he went away.     &nbsp;  I.Was his favorite grandchild amg the 16 he had. He and my grandmother took care of me when i was little.But i was pampered by him the most cos i was the youngest to be taken care of then. And he never lets others forget that Im his favorite. Even as&nbsp;child back then, I used to get treated like a queen. My yayi,wld pick me up from my kindergarten lessons.. And instead of going home straight, i would demand to go to some provision shops to get some munchies.. He would always give in to me.. With a smile on his face. I have this teddy bear that I've been sleeping with since forever. And its somehow connected to my yayi cos he sewed my bear a plaster on its ear. Why? Cos back then, my older siblings and cousins used to kick it around.. And i always cried.. Holding its already-there-velcro-plaster&nbsp; in my hand.. My yayi.. consoled me and sewed it for me when i was sleeping..It mite sound so lame.. But heck it, i love it all the same. Its the little thing he does that make me remember him the most. Gosh..Theres so much about tings we shared together. Our evening trips to the coffeeshop where he had his kopi and i wld be placed in a 20cent per minute toy car.. Theres so much life in the memories. If only I could relive it once more.. But thats impossible..     &nbsp;  Lesson's learnt. Tell someone you love him/her b4 its too late.   And I'll make sure i do. But there's no such person rite now.   I just quite ended something with someone few days ago. Wont go into that though.   Anyways.. Im clueless as how to upload pics and music in my blog here. Eh jepah,if u reading this.. Go get urself a blog soon. And then lead me the way how to make my blog nice nice ok..    Oraites then.. I'll be writing later.. When i get freakin bored or have too many seconds to spare..    Regards

        I came across your picture that day     And wishing you were here.     Our memories as they sweetly played     Made me want you near.       Wishing you were here right now     To share this gracious day.     Wishing you were here with me     And wipe these tears away.       I wish so much that I could see     And hold and have you near.     Theres nothing what I wouldnt give     How i wish i had you here.       It doesnt matter how long the time     Has past since you've been gone     Only God knows deep in my heart     My love for you lives on.       You understood and guided me     Every step along the way.     You told me to be patient with life     But you werent here to stay.       You gave me peace to conquer     All my sadness and all my tears.     You said 'one day we'll meet again'     And i wont need to wish you were here.     I love you, yayi..     Forever...

      My life..full of stupid rollercoaster rides that sometimes,i just dun need it. Im just plastic,u see.I smile to everyone i noe..well almost.But actually i havent moved on yet.I still cant accept the fact tt God took my grandfather away frm me 3 wks ago.. I really love him with all my heart.I took care of him during the sch holidays..and i still cant believe he's realli gone!! Life's pretty fucked up now that i wake up every morning and realising tat i dun have to go back to my childhood home to visit my grandfather animre..i miss him so much,my hart bleeds..God,if ur hearing my prayers rite now, at the very least,put him amg those you love and tell him to look down on me everyday.and tell him too, that i really love him.Cos every smile i put on my face,its just to hide my running tears.Therefore,im plastic..  My Day 15/7/06 Pretty sucky.Fucked up as usual.Hate those bloody younger girls who have a problem with me over someting im not aware of.Started off when this particular gerl wanted to slap me,cos i was telling nana(my bes bud) that "eh pmpan tu jln kengkang"..I was referring to a teacher of ours..not this 14 yr old gerl!She apparently,terasa sgt and wanted to slap me.Yeah rite..I'll fuck her upside down if she did.Like she dared anyway.Fuck her.And her bloody friend & the parents who fought with nana.Revenge gonna be sweet. "Berdiam diri bukan ertinya kau kalah"   I regretted my decision.Shldnt have told khairul that.Now he hasnt smses me yet even though he said he gonna sms me last nite.He didnt till now..Guys..Ur all the same.. Khairul is just some other guy whom everyone wld say Handsome bt he has his bad points. Kept me waiting 4 2 hrs the last time i went out with him.And after i left the place,then he arrived.I hate those type of ppl, bt why do i like this guy? God,get him out of my head.Sometimes,i just wish i will hate guys..Guys are the downfall of me.I hate them so much at times.Im being practical here.I just seem to meet the wrong guys in life.Cos all they're after for is just my body.Not kidding.And i fucking hate that.So now,Im trying my best to fucking hate guys.Cos ur all the same. Peace out~

       rites..used to diss ppl who have blogs..now i have one myself.  to start off.. im pathetically studying in the goddamned Damai sec.yeah,i retained cos i failed badly 4 my end yrs last yr. wont go into that anyway. Im 16 and seeing my frens up there takin their O's later tis yr.. it realli saddens me that i cant be there to graduate together.but i feel quite proud that i noe these ppl and i feel so happy for them..well..back to myself.  Im in a family of 6..im the third child out of 4.I have an older bro,he's 22 i tink and is currently serving his NS and my older sis hus 20 is in NUS..yeah,she's damn bloody clever bt sometimes i tink she's stupid,when it cums to choosing boyfriends.Im not gonna go into that.All i can say is that I dun LiKE her boyfriend!okay..moving on..My younger sis is onli 12..and taking her PSLE later tis yr..She better not slack and go into my bloody school..I'll screw her if that happens.My mom is one of the ppl i love in the world.Of cos,she gave birth to me.And i appreciate her for everything she has done 4 me.She has done alot for me.Im not good in showing my love,but if she ever comes across this blog of mine,i hope she noes how much i really love her despite giving her hard times and rocky turbulences in our family the last 2 yrs.That brings me to my father.He loves me in his own way,that i know and i love him too.I love him so much now bt yeah..I cant seem to express my love to my family tt easy.Bottomline: Im a i-love-my-family girl.  Yet,im so stubborn.And naive.And emotional.And bloody noisy.And egoistic.U'll tend to noe more abt me in times to come..

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~    Hey..Its been a weakly boring day. Had my maths test in the last period. And i've been dragging my art folio since like forever and believe me, I still havent completed it yet. O shit.. Of all things,haven done my SW. Damn. Damn.I'll say it again. Damn.     &nbsp;  Nothing happened much in school.Oh..Woke up this morning only to find my contact lens case tilted and the solution inside the case spilled thru the airhole. So i thought it was okay to wear.. Hahaz. I thought wrong. Damn my eyes hurt alot. I had to wear my glasses instead. The glasses were of my previous degrees so obviously, I cant see that well even with the glasses on. Yes yes,my plastic nerdy glasses. Hehehe.. U know, one of my ex and his friends actually were laughing when they see me. I just dont get it why. I might look different, nerdy or whatever but why should they care man..&nbsp;I dont come to school to look pretty or Very presentable for them. I wear and do which i tink is best for me. And for that, they actually deserved my middle finger salute frm me. They did. Showed them before walking away. =)     &nbsp;  Watched Korean War during my SS study hour just now. It was like sitting in the movies. Benji bought potato chips and I was like this mad girl,screaming and laughing thruout the whole class. Hahaha.. I don't know la.. I was x-tra hyper today.Too hyperactive. Hahahaha..    &nbsp;  After our study hour,waited for nana,zsa,yana and farisah.Hidayah and shahidah didnt join us cos they went to meet their boyfriends. Tata was with me. And we all went to Econ to eat karipap cos zsa mengidam sangat. Hahaha.. We did what we do best. Eating and talkin abt our day plus the bitch-talking. Yeah.. bitch-talking.I love doing that.     &nbsp;  So this is it. My day. Have no idea whats heading my way tomorrow. But something's for sure today.I miss Yayi again. Today is like 30 days he's been gone. And im still missing him. I love you. Good night my dearest. Love you like I always do. Hope this kiss reaches u.M wackz!!   ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~

But Mr Raj let us go on behalf of Racial Harmony. Yeahz yeahz~ ....     &nbsp;   God.. Its like battle of the cheongsams. Rafta wore a real nice pink cheongsam. Damn, if i slim down, i mite be able to wear that next yr but trust me, i dun think i'll be wearing any cheongsams from now on. No originality. Played alot in front of zakiah's camera. Thanx to Moon. My funny faces ended up saved in Zak's camera. Lols. I didnt take any fotos with alot of guys tis time. Only with Weihan, Ismail and Amirhadi ( is that how u spell the name?) haha.. cos&nbsp;Ismail looks so much like my ex, Irwan frm S'pore Poly. Weihan.. Haix.. No need to explain la. If not for his bloody pea-brain antics, i wld have thot he's one of the gorgeous guys arnd. But,i take back&nbsp;my words. Hahaha.. Took a pic with amirhadi la. Yeah..&nbsp;He's one of the only 2 guys i find handsome in school. Bt i shall stop there and say no more. Haha. = My lips are sealed and tight. The other handsome guy.. Nowhere to be seen. But heckz~     &nbsp;   After school, we went to Tampines BK to eat! Hungry like hell.. Whopper meal each. Then we went to finish up my film and took pics at the Standard Chartered Building. Da abes lik dat.. Went home la.. At arnd 5 plus i think. Tired. I wore heels but strangely, my feet didnt hurt a single bit. Lols. Reached home, took a bath and went to bed straight. Couldnt tahan animre.. So tired. Im not the least prepared for my Maths test tomorrow. Argh!! &nbsp; #Take me out!# &nbsp;    ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~  &nbsp;  Listening to the rain outside,&nbsp;up against the glass   I saw a shadow in the hall, I saw it walk right past   It made its way into the room where I last saw your face   The last time there was laughter in this forsaken place     My book of prayers fell to the floor, my heart began to pound   I listened hard to hear your voice but there was not a sound   I clear my eyes and look around to see if it was you   You’re standing right in front of me, I don’t know what to do     I try to talk, no words come out, my tears they start to fall   You’re looking at me longingly, your name I try to call   You do not speak, you do not laugh, you do not even cry   I look into your deep teary eyes and try to ask you why     Why you left me like you did, and what am I to do   This life I live is not a life, especially without you   The tears I cry, I cry for you, it’s so hard to go on   Just knowing that you’ll not be back, you are forever gone     A lightning flash, a clash of thunder bring me to my senses   I'm all alone without you here and utterly defenseless   The day I laid you in the ground my life was buried too   It won’t be long, you have my word, I’m coming back to you.&nbsp;    &nbsp;  In memory of my beloved Yayi.Written specially for him. Rest in Peace my dearest.Im coming soon.    &nbsp;  ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~   &nbsp;   Well.. i've done my work. All finished. Got pretty time on my hands to spare. And i don't know what to do. Ahhz.. Well,i might as just stop here for awhile. Currently,listening to Nickleback's How&nbsp;You Remind Me. The band rocks and so&nbsp;does the song. Owh,I love Nickleback. I mean,the music. I dont worship the band. Lol.&nbsp;My fav part of the song:&nbsp;   &nbsp;&nbsp;   It's not like you didn't know that    I said I love you and I swear I still do    And it must have been so bad    Cause living with me must have damn near killed you    And this is how you remind me of what I really am    This is how you remind me of what I really am   &nbsp;   Im so not looking forward to tomorrow. Its gonna be a draggy Monday.. Have to the final design for my art project. Sucky. The only thing Im looking forward for tomorrow is the end of the school lessons.. So i can go home and sleep straight away. Oh yeah.. Have i mentioned I missed yayi badly? =) I miss you Yayi.. Love u so much. Wish that i can dream of u every night. Or every minute when im sleeping. In that case, I dont mind&nbsp;sleeping always. Ooops.. These days, Im getting more n more lethargic. Cant seem to handle my eyes like I used to last time. Sleepy~    Orites.. Let my lethargic-ness (is there ever such a word aniwae?) take over me and I shall let dreamland conquer my world in like 8 mins time when I'll close my eyes and see perfectness of this beautiful world,sleeping.Gnitez.   &nbsp;   ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~  &nbsp;  Hey..Its a bloody Sunday. No i dont mean the Protestant-Catholic's Bloody Sunday. Hoho. This Sunday is bloody borringg to me! I havent even started on my hw yet.. Onli done my art folio so far.. And yet, I forgot to do the last page -- Color Scheme. How can i forget man? After packing up my things,realised I havent done a single color scheme for my design. Lols. Actualli,not that i care much.Im bad at art. And I suck at it. So, i hate art. Duh~    &nbsp;  Decided to wear my purple kebaya on Tues. Half a mind to wear and half a mind feels like not coming. But at the thought of celebrating it together with my beloved gang of friends for the last time,of cos i would come la. Haf to treasure these last moments.     &nbsp;  O man.. I miss working. My friends and I are part-time waitresses at malay wedding banquets on Sundays. It was fun working actually. Aiyah.. I prefer to call it 'helping out'. Our pay's peanuts.. but we don't really care,for now. Hahahz. That reminds me of that bloody Khairul. Thats how i got to know him.     &nbsp;  During Syuhadah's aunt's wedding, we were helping out. And khairul was one of the boys working for the caterer's company. Yeahz.. he cooks and all. My other friends noticed him first. Before we even started doing our work. I didnt know who he was.. Only that the other girls refer to him as " Abg Pink". Hahaha. Rites.. How did i actually notice him? Well.. I didnt know he was "Abg Pink". Okok.. The first time i saw him, he was half naked. Only in hix boxers. Just came out of the tent. And we saw each other that way. It was quite funny cos I was carrying the dirty dishes,walking towards the diswashers,who were located behind the tent. And. We actually stopped for a second and stared at each other. For a split second only. And then I just smiled back&nbsp;at him cos he smiled. Actually.. I was smiling bcos his body was not too bad after all. The only turn off was that he's bloody shorter than me by a few cm.. Hahaha.. So,from there, whenever he saw me, he would whistle at me and pretend to look at other things. Im no bimbo..So obviously,I knew he was just teasing me. And I, played on the game as well. Hahaha.. Nana noticed us actually. Soon, he was labelled "Abg Hensem" cos amg all, he was the bes looking la. Hahaha.. There was one point of time, we were resting and sitting down, behind the tent, and Khairul was there. Collecting the washed dishes, i think. I was talking to Raihanah abt the plenty number of guys arnd. And blatantly, I just said " rezeki jgn tolak, musuh jgn carik" All the girls laughed at that comment cos I was like pointing my finger at Khairul who was facing backwards when i said that. They got my cue.. Hahahaha. He heard that. Obviously. So when we finished our work, before we went off, we took a pic with the bride and groom. While queuing up to take the pic, our eyes met again and I just gave a casual wave. Well.. He told me to come over to him after the pic cos he wanted my number.. So thats how we knew each other. Eh,bloody hell. Why am i talking abt Khairul? Lol. Anyway.. the story between my and Khairul shall continue some other time. Hehehe..    &nbsp;  So back to my art I guess. Better start on my color schemes. Or I'll die.I'd love that actually.No,I was just kidding. Orites.. Till then.

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~    My apologies. Didnt update lately cos my bloody brother had to conquer back this computer and i cant use it while he's around. Argh~ Nvm.. My weekend..Has been very relaxing. Slept alot. On Saturday,had PFT in the morning. Woke up at 7 and by 9.30 was back home. Washed up.. and went straight to bed. Woke up again at 3. Went back to sleep at 10. Wow. M.R.T. aka Makan,Rest,Tidur.    &nbsp;  Didnt do anything today.Woke up at 9.30 and went back to sleep after having breakfast. Hehehe. I didnt even bothered to wash up. Woke up again at 2. Boring day. Watched Spiderman and Shrek 2 today. I love Puss in Boots!! So cute!! =)    &nbsp;  Friday nite... Khairul smsed me. And I didnt even bother to reply. What a waste of time. To hell with him. And other guys. Most guys i mean. To hell with u.    &nbsp;  Rite now, im desperately looking for songs. Seems so difficult to d/l nowadays. The servers are often down. Oh btw.. My mum asked who was amirhadi when she saw my album on Friday. Just told her it was some guy I like. And she just kept quiet and then suddenly stared at the picture and asked " asal dekat2 nah?" Hahaha.. I just laughed. So did she.. Guess she's understanding.     &nbsp;  Well... that was my weekend. Very boring. This coming Friday,Im sleeping over at Nyai's place cos on Saturday evening,we're having a kenduri for Allahyarham Yayi. I had a dream the other nite abt him. Cant remember everything but certain details are for me and for me. Im keeping my sweet dreams to myself. But it'll be good if i get to dream abt Yayi almost every nite. Goodness,I've been saying that all the time. Im so sorry.     &nbsp;  Ok..So now, I have to excuse myself. I don't know what homework I have actually. Quite clueless. God.. Well,thats it then. I'll update tomorrow or whatever ok.. See ya arnd! *Loving You Yayi Dearest*    ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~    Woah!! My last entry was 25th July!! God.. Im so sorry.. I've been neglecting my blog!! Well, so much has happened man.. Got lodsa to tell you!!      Firstly, I got someone new in my life.. Hehe.. Wont mention his name yet here.. But im pretty much sure u got the idea who.. Hehehe.. Im accidentally in love with him... He keeps me happy and he make my everyday!! Well.. We're not really official yet but I guess.. Its gonna be soon.. Hehehe..      Okay.. So on Saturday,I had this stupid POA thingy at Ngee Ann Poly. We got 4th.. Didnt win anything.. But who cares anyway.. The strange thing tt happened to me that day was when i went to the stupid bloody toilet at the block.. The metal door of the toilet pierced into the back of my heel.. Imagine the pain.. Thats not all.. I didnt feel any pain at all in the 1st place so i just went to the cubicle to ease myself.. Strangely,when i entered the cubicle,my hairs stood at the ends.. And i suddenly felt so dizzy rite after I came out of the cubicle.. All i know, within split seconds, I was on the floor.. Felt so damn dizzy.. Everything was almost pitch black.. And I could see stars arnd.. Seriously,Im not kidding.. I really thought I saw stars arnd Ms Fok's face. So the ppl attended first aid to me.. Which really sucked cos halfway the bandage came off.. Ms Fok put us in a cab all the way to Bedok Mrt (thanks eh!!) and lucky 4 me.. By tt time i was okay already.. Went to meet someone.. Hehehe.. And he sent me back to my grandmother's place cos we had my yayi's 40 death days prayers thingy.. Malays call it Tahlil. Yep... Saw my cuzinz and all.. They and my aunties/uncle saw the foto I took together with him.. Commented tt he was handsome and had a nice body. Hehehe.. The whole thing ended quite late.. I went home at arnd 10 plus.. I missed yayi.. So did everyone.. (Love you.)   And that particular nite.. My sis told her her bf what happend to me at Ngee Ann which happens to be his own sch and guess wat he told her..? Tt blk's toilet (the one i went into) was actualy rumoured to be haunted cos some girl commited suicide in there.. So much 4 empathy..      My Sunday was not tt bad.. Spent the whole day at hme again.. Doing nothing.. Just smsing someone all day.. Hehehe.. School started again on Monday.. And it was usual too. Yesterday... Tuesday!! Had POA enrichment course.. So fun! My team won!! Yeahh!! And then I went home straight cos I wanted to get somethings at Tampines later on.. Reached hme at 5.30 and changed and all.. Well, I actualli got accompanied by my 'someone'. Hehehe.. He waited at my bus stop at arnd 7.15.. And we went to get my things la.. After tt.. Walked at TM for awhile.. Only to run into 2 damaians.. Haiz..We bought ice creams at Mcdonalds and ate behind the Tamp Mrt Station.. Yeah..Sat there and talked 4 awhile.. B4 i went home at 8.30 like dat..We took the same bus,65.. Cos he's gona meet his friends nearby..I gave him a kiss b4 he dropped off.. Hehehe.. Woo.. Im in love...      So today.. My day has been so far so good. Didnt have Physics test cos everyone played hide and seek with that stupid relieve teacher.. B4 that.. Met him 4awhile then after his study hr,met him again.. Then after his d&amp;t.. Met him again.. Hahaha.. He sent me hme until outside my lift. Hehehe.. Got a kiss frm him.. In school!! *embarassed*      Okok.. So i really dun like this friend of his and she in return dun like me too. Obviously,i dun care la..We're still trying not to let anyone know abt us yet.. My friends all know of cos... But regardless to his friends especially his gerl-friends.. We still try to keep it low..

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~    My day.12/8/04.   Has been fucking crappy. Firstly,in school, Im very proud of Nana that she got A1 for her O Level Malay Paper. But the fucking thing is that, Juliana,came up and asked her for the results, before actually turning to me and asked how did I fare too. When I gave tt face,she just looked at me down sarcastically and just went "ohh..." and walked away. FUCKER.. I think she must have heard me swearing her. She with her bloody not pretty face and that disgusting hairstyle on her.. Somebody ought tell her that she totally sucks.. Wait you,next yr when I take my O's I'll make sure I get a very nice A1 and dangle the cert in front of ur so-not-nice-looking face.      So i had study hour after that then i meet up with Nana to eat instant noodles cos we were so hungry.. Talked frm 3.30 to 5 like that then my boyfriend came over after his d&t and Nana went home. Chilled with him for awhile onli.. 5.30 went home.. Washed up and then slept until 8pm. Didnt realised I slept all the way.. Called my boyfriend, I also dunno why I called him rite after I woke up.. Report strength? Hahaha..      At dinner,I had an argument with my mum. Which is like so totally NOT my fault.. And she slapped me for it. Of course, I cried. Cos its been so fucking long since anyone slapped me.. And there she was slapping me for some argument so baseless. Well,so i locked the door cos I was so MAD!! 20 mins later.. Knock knock.. Someone came to apologize...       So now,Im chatting with my cuzzin Fursham. His dad is by right, my dad's cousin. But because my nyai breastfed his dad, and based on our religion, his dad and my dad are considered blood brothers.. Its complicated but yeah.. We are 'muhrim' and considered Cousins! Hahaha.. Take ur time to register tt. While at that, I just realised I have my POA hw to do.. and my Chem overdued hw too. And also, Im waiting for my dearest to sms me.. So I guess that shld be it for today.    ***Im missing Yayi so much.. Every day when I step out of the house, I see his old bicycle.. Yes..The bicycle he used to ride on.. And I often ride pillion and he would send me to the bus stop on it.. Even tho the bus stop is so near.. Thats how pampered i was by him.. Im also gonna miss remindin him that my birthday is nearing.. The only person I have no qualms telling that too is my Yayi.. But he's gone and I can say those words " Yayi, my b'dae coming soon.. Get ready my present eh.." no more. I just hope that in every birthdays of mine to come, he'll just come in my dreams and give me the wish I've been hoping for all this while ever since he went away and that is.. for me to keep to myself. Well.. I just miss him so much. Missing everything about him.. I miss him.. I love him.. (And no one can ever replace the empty slot in my heart cos there's no one like you, yayi...) *** //Spin me around till I fell asleep,then up the stairs he would carry me,and i knew for sure.. I was loved. If i could get another chance,another walk,another dance with him, i'll play a song that will never end.. How I love,love to dance with my Yayi again//    ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~

      I keep asking myself...How come I love him..so much? It might be just our honeymoon days cos its only the beginning.. But for now,lemme just say that I really love this guy. *Cant believe Im yours & ur mine*  If I Aint Got You - Alicia Keys Some people live for the fortune Some people live just for the fame Some people live for the power, yeah Some people live just to play the game Some people think that the physical things define what’s within And I been there before but that’s life’s a bore, so full of the superficial  Chorus: Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah  Some people search for a fountain The promise is forever young (You know) Some people need 3 dozen roses And that’s the only way to prove you love them Hand me the world on a silver platter And what good would it be? With no one to share with no one who truly cares for me  Chorus: Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you, you, you Some people want it all, but I don’t want nothing at all If it aint you baby, if I aint got you baby Some people want diamond rings, some just want everything But everything means nothing if I aint got you, yeah  If aint got you with me baby, ohh, ooo Say nothing in this whole wide world don’t mean a thing If I aint got you with me baby.

       ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~     Yesterday,I met my boyfriend at Bedok Intg approximately at arnd 3pm la.. I was a few minutes late. We took 196 and made our way to Shaw Tower to watch The Village for the 3.45pm show. By the time we bought the tickets and reached the theatre,the movie already started. I quite understood the show,but halfway... I lost my concentration cos it was simply too draggy and boring. My boyfriend,was sick.. Having his cold.. Poor him. Hehehe.. I almost fell asleep actually.. The movie was like 2hrs.. Not worth watching.. But the theatre was not packed at all. In fact,only 1/6 of the theatre was occupied.. Came out of the movie at 5.45pm.      Went to Marina Square to eat cos we felt hungry.. Ate at Mcdonalds.. Then Raihanah called to say she too is in Marina Square.. With her boyfriend.. Eating at K. Rogers. Met them and Feeza after that. Feeza had to bring along her siblings.. Poor her. Lol. We made our way to the Esplanade.. And damn,it was bloody packed. Had to squeezed thru until we reached the mid of Esplanade and Merlion. And met Nana and Jali,her boyfriend there. Her boyfriend was becoming friendlier.. Lol.. Such a small world that my boyfriend know Jali.. Cos they always play football la..      So we watched the fireworks.. Abit onli.. Cos the Pan Pacific Hotel blocked it!! Hahaha.. I watched the fireworks already actualli on Sunday. Lols.. But it was sweet la.. Cos we were with our loved ones.. Saw Zaid and his gfren.. He was shocked when seeing me and Amirhadi. Nevertheless, we had fun that day. Took 14 home.. Saw abit of S'pore Idol.. So bloody funny man.. Lodsa crappy talent.       That was it. I reached hme close to 11. But i enjoyed it.. cos I get to spend the day with him and my friends(for a while,at least).. Hehehehe     ~Put my soul on hold,let it drop like my heart,cos thats the way you want it to be~
