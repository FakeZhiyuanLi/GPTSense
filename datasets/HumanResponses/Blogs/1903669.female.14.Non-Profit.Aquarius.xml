      yesterday was really good! thanks bec for inviting us over! and thanks to sam, uncle richard and aunty mavis for putting up with us! =) hehehe! we had a great time... pigging out... playing games... watching cable!!!!!!!... playing grafitti... surfing the net.... all fun fun fun! =) hope everyone is having a safe holiday... but fun and un-boring! =) i'm finding it very boring... even though i should be practicing piano.. i've done my practice today... but'll have to do some more tonight... *sigh*.... =)   holidays for me...: holidays are a time to get away, from stinky pe and the crowded bus bay. holidays are a time of boredom,  long days spent in the sleep kingdom. holidays are filled with fun with friends,  but then boredom as all the fun ends. holidays are when you make lame tries, at poems that never rhyme-s...?!?!  so there you go... what my holidays are all about... ooh ooh! the perfect last line...  at a poem that never rhymes! *sighs*

      it's those little things in life that seem to pick me up everyday! -commerce/sport selections: suprise teacher, mr rodger... my fave teacher... and then an all out race down to the 'SHED' to pick sports... get in line only to think that we miss out... but get in! =) - maths: laughing our heads off for no apparent reason, just happy and all smiles =) - recess: what more can i say? - history: the annoyance of mrs taylor talking... and her ignorance of our misbehaviour =) - science: mucking around to no end... ask for a muck up period tomorrow... too bad =( hehehe =) - english: do a bunch of questions while in the process of bashing each other... and being told to SHUT UP by the teacher... almost..  - lunch: running around the school... following lisa on her quest to find her continuously missing bottle... found in art room... and under the benches at b block... - scripture: mcgee and me may always provide a weird sense of humour... laughing at the weird and *cough* humourous jokes..  - maths (again): only to find ourselves laughing our heads off for no apparent reason... again - commerce: suprise return of our teacher... and a video from aeons ago! our teacher's dismissal of jay's core of a pear... that was whole when she walked in! - bus stop: windy... trying to stop our skirts from flying up... thankfully succeeded! =) it's funny how those little things in life can make you start laughing and smiling like an idiot! =)

      when we were having grade trials, i grazed my knees... and they sting when i wash them... just me complaining about nothing.. as usual..! (oh yeah.. i didn't get in!) *sigh* for me, october means... piano exam... musical... and HOLIDAYS!!! ... church camp included!.. yet why is feeling such a drag??? *sigh* i think it's coz it's been really hot lately... and i've had to practice piano.... *sigh* i really think this is going to be the end of piano for me... if i don't get at least a b+... my teacher's going to kick me out.... *sigh*... which basically means no holiday for me! =(

      (and I'm not talking about energy stuff!)  how much does a wave actually say? well, what sort of a wave do YOU give? is it a 'hello wave' or a 'go away wave'? usually, a wave means 'hey! how's it going' or something... it's usually a friendly thing and can mean alot to someone who's having it bad at the moment.  so give that someone a wave tomorrow and you may make them feel that tiny bit better! =)

       The Apostle  Paul was a great guy. He started off being this really bad guy, Saul, persecuting Chrisitians everywhere and then Jesus appeared to him as a great light and told him to stop persecuting Him. Then he changed his name to Paul and went on to spread the gospel throughout most of the world... he was a really good guy! maybe we may not be Christians today... that would be pretty freaky... or maybe we wouldn't have the freedom to believe in Christianity... it would be a totally different world... for me anyway... we might not be able to perform our musical... and our musical is really good! and it should be... after so many hours of practice and rehearsals! =)

      I'm actually supposed to be doing my chinese homework... but my parents have gone out. I'm gonna make this short because I have to learn stuff... *sigh*  Today I missed the bus and I realised how much i take the bus for granted. sometimes the bus driver may be a little slow and we get pissed coz we wanna get home, but do we ever stop to think about what time the bus driver wants to go home?!? So, i guess what i'm trying to say is that the bus driver isn't just the bus driver. He has a life too! Thank him once in a while! =) What are you supposed to do when you find out the true you.. and you don't like it??? *shrug*

      These are all from Stacie Orrico songs... I was looking up the lyrics to "More to Life" (which are now up on the lyrics page!)  "Dear Friend" (this is the whole song....)   Dear Friend, what's on your mind You don't laugh the way you used to But I've noticed how you cry Dear friend, I feel so helpless I see you sit in silence As you face new pain each day I feel there's nothing I can do I know you don't feel pretty Even though you are But it wasn't your beauty That found room in my heart  Dear friend, you are so precious Dear Friend  Dear friend, I'm here for you I know that you don't talk too much But we can share this day anew Dear Friend, please don't feel like you're alone There is someone who is praying Praying for your peace of mind Hoping joy is what you'll find I know you don't feel weak Even though you are But it wasn't your strength That found room in my heart Dear friend, you are so precious, Dear Friend   "With a Little Faith" (excerpt)   It seems to wash away Can't find a will to go on But I am here to say there's hope You must carry on Jesus will light your way He'll give you all that you need No need to be afraid all you've got to do is believe   "So Pray" (excerpt)   And I see you when you're walking round And your head is hanging down I can tell that you've been crying lately Cause your face is always wearing a frown I can see you wanna talk about it But you don't know what to say But I consider you a friend today  So I'll pray that God will make it okay   "So Pray" has nice lyrics =)  "Where is the Love" (ok... so it's not Stacie Orrico.... but it has such relevant lyrics! =)..... what?!?... oh yeah... excerpt)   But if you only have love for your own race Then you only leave space to discriminate And to discriminate only generates hate And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah   Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity Whatever happened to the fairness in equality Instead in spreading love we spreading animosity Lack of understanding, leading lives away from unity   ok.. so maybe some of them aren't exactly short... =) but they were still sweet and that's what really matters! =)

      1. you don't!  2. you don't have too... people end up feeling sorry for you anyway... =) asking if you're feeling better... blah blah blah blah... =) 3. you scream and yell as loud as you can... and then you get your way...   I've been going for number 2! since i got back today, SO many people have asked me if I'm feeling better... well, it feels to good to be looked after like that... =) *shrug* hope this 'blog' satisfies the needs of the people who have no life and go around checking people's blogs every five seconds *jay!* *cough*  ok... so i'm trying to invite people to the church musical... i've given them the leaflet... but they haven't gotten back to me.. anyone have any ideas?  i don't think this is blog length enough for some people... but it'll have to do for now.... unless you want a whole page about me feeling sick... and how annoying it is! =)

      Ick! Me feeling very sick though not as bad as yesterday. I missed out last two periods (only History and English) annd i got to miss out all of today. As usual, I'm meant to be doing my assignment... the commerce one... but I'm getting side tracked as usual! For all of you who haven't seen Finding Nemo: You should be very ashamed of yourself! It's SO good! Ah... my favourite line is the one from the turtle... don't remember his name...  first you were like WOAH! and then you were like WoAh! and then you were like woah....  hehehe! When we went to see it, there was this little girl sitting on the seat next to us when we were waiting outside. Me and Raf were saying which characters we liked and she said "I like Finding Nemo!" I thought that was really cute! It just kinda reminded me that when you're little, you're so innocent... *shrug*

       A woman was asked by a coworker, "What is it like to be a Christian?"  The coworker replied, "It is like being a pumpkin. God picks you from  the patch, brings you in, and washes all the dirt off of you.  Then, he cuts off the top and scoops out all the yucky stuff. He removes  the seeds of doubt, hate, greed, etc., and then He carves you a new  smiling face and puts His light inside of you to shine for all the world  to see."  This was passed on to me from another pumpkin. Now, it is your turn pass  it to a pumpkin.    or then you can have the pumpkins used for halloween.... with halloween around the corner... halloween is annoying. you get those little kids who can be bothered to walk all the way up our driveway.... and then you have them knocking at the door for ages... only to find that we're 'not at home'. we just never have stuff to give them.. so we never answer the door! you'd think they'd get the message! =)   on a happier note... though still sticking to sugar (excuse the so not funny pun), we're getting krispy kreme donuts next friday! yummy yummy!

      there are the times when there's just one person who can annoy you so much... that you feel like you're going to explode... so it's not a very godly thought... after church camp, i've been encouraged to act more godly... even though it's not what i do that grants me eternal life... to those people i've been a bum to lately: sorry! =(   on a happier note... church camp was REALLY good! =) kel willis had really good talks... and they were really encouraging... made me think about lots of stuff... and then at the end.... during testimonies... everyone was crying... and laughing... but it was all good! =) i had so much fun! =)  musical is in less than a week! =) ARGH!

      woke up... latish... realised that YAY we were going to wonderland! got ready etc went to pick up raf then went on our way... got there and we went on those swinging charis twice... then got dizzy... saw those swinging boats had a turn even though slightly confused abot why they were there in the first place... should have been on the otherside of the rainbow... hana something land.. anyway... then we went and lined up for the bumper cars... waited for ages... had a go... raf got stuck! (so did i... *blushes*) then went up to the rainbow just to see what had happened... nope.. it was sectioned off... walked back down... met su yins parents... stopped and waited for su yin and sisters to get off the demon... they finally got off... then we went to the beastie... or whatever... on the way we went on the hms endeavor... then went on the beastie and waited for ages... while butterflies multiplied in my stomach... finally got on with raf.. but not su yin and co... was SO fun... but the first dip.. very scary! wanted to go again.. but we were hungry.... waited for the others to go.... then went to get lunch... first went to get 'show bags' from the westac place.. returned to the lunch area to find them gone... GREAT! (note sarcasm) walked back to the westpac place... they had walked there.. THANKS! then we walked out to the restaurant at the front... for lunch? no... had nuggets and chips, raf had fish burger.. and mum and dad decided to leave us and go out for chinese.... *shrug* we went to the beach... supposedly to meet with su yin and family.. we couldn't find them so just sat down coz we were tired and exhausted... and hot... went to those old fashioned cars... raf drove.. i relaxed... mum called and said that they were back... we met them... and then we wanted to go on the river rampage (whatever)... rang su yin to see if we wanted to go with them.. they were already in line.. apparently near the front.. then we couldn't be bothered to go by ourselves... and didn't really want to get wet... so we waited for their turn... and it didn't come for AGES... they were going to go to the beach after... we hadn't brought swimming stuff... so we went without them,... went back on the beastie.... and wanted to go again... but headachy... coz we swapped seats and agreed that the previous seats were better... then we went on the hms endeavor again.. and again... wanted to go on swinging chairs.. but got dizzy.... wanted to go driving again.. but it had closed... =( so we went home... tired.... exhausted.. and disappointed.... =( had pizza for dinner... studied some... slept  sunday came.... church.. yawn... 'lost' bible... found it... went home for boring lunch... studied some... did rap... chicken dinner... miss congeniality... sleep  so, how was your weekend?

      do you think you would be able to study better in a study group (and i mean STUDY STUDY group) at someone else's house or by yourself at home? ok.. so we may get a little distracted... but STILL!!!!! we WANT to study... so if we want to we will right... so why won't my mum let me go!!!!! ARGH!!!! i can never study by myself... it's so stupid... ARGH!!!! (sorry to people reading this... this is nothing very important... skip this whole paragraph..) i mean.. i asked her if we could have it here... so she can keep an eye out for us and make sure that we're studying... but then she decides that she doesn't hear me!!!! ARGH!!!!! so to jay, harshi, nya and jill... SORRY! i'll still do my notes. though... ARGH!!!! *sigh*  it's safe to start reading now... i have to make summaries of music and german... easy.... maybe i might go and try to catch up on my history... mrs taylor is such a bad teacher... at least she gives us sheets to highlight and stuff... =) hehehe   we have so much stuff to learn for maths... and science too.. everything we've done this WHOLE year!!! ARGH!!!!! (oops.. there i go again!)  nothing else to write.. hope all of you who have exams to ok... remember that god is always with you! just trust and rely on him to get you through all these exams! don't worry... be happy! =)

      it was all planned but now it's all gone to pieces... like a puzzle... when you finish it and then you wreck it all up... and put it away so you can do it again... only i didn't want to wreck it! *sigh* oh well... i'll deal... i'll just do the puzzle again... =)

      so now chistmas is over and i feel slightly deflated... oh well... there's new years to look forward to! only a dinner at uncle edwins.. reminds me too much of church anniversary dinner... ARGH! boredom is slowly settling in and i am struggling to find something even the slightest bit interesting to do. blogging is one of them.. but frustration soon kicks in as the computer decides to crash and lose an already written up blog entry.  post christmas sales take up most of the weekend. went to grace bros for 15% off all music cds.. only to read the small print at the bottom: excluding all top 30 cds. looks for a certain favourite single... to find it "unavailable". settles for delta's predictable for a grand total of $2.51. stocks up on 50% off christmas cards. now has 60 for next year! =)  midday tv is limited. sabrina at 11, popular at 2. a gap between 12 and 2 gives a little leeway for whatever midday movie happens to catch my interest. today it so happens to be oliver twist... i decide to wait until popular... an old friend turns up on msn. talk.... or chat rather. discuss when to see a movie... and if we should ask another friend...  looking forward to DISN1011 tomorrow... if parents will lose the protectiveness and let me go! already in an argument about how i should clean my room.... when it is acutallly pretty neat at the moment.... =/ now it's all about how i should practice piano/clarinet... it's the holidays!!! grrrrrrr *frustration kicks in* before i start raving on and on about how unfair it is to be.... my age... i'll stop...

(yay!) dad wasn't home when i got back, so i mucked around for a while, making myself chocolate and oreo ice cream! =) mmmmmmmm ! =P then dad came home and then i finished shanaya's book. had nuggets and chips for dinner, watched judging amy and then cam online... which is where the next bit comes from:  for our english thing, we have to make a crossword. being the good lil girls that we are, harshi, shanaya, jessie and i were trying to finish the whole thing. it's due tomorrow you see! me and harshi are trying to do a crossword over the net and let me tell you, it's VERY complicated! =) her msn stuffed, and then i was left to talk to myself =) (first sign of insanity!) then she came back and then i got kinda:  frustrated, coz i was tired... SORRY JAY!   now, we have finished. if anyone actually wants to do the crossword, give me a yell and i'll give it to you... send it.. whatever! =)   a pretty decent sized entry for 12:31 am so.... =) zzzzzzzzzzzz i'm tired and my eyes are about to close! =)   for those not going to school tomorrow: have a good holiday, merry christmas, and a happy new year!

      tassie was a lot of things... some parts were boring... like driving in the car.... some parts were fun... like the maze, where me and dad got lost! =)   highlights? hmmmm.... seeing penguins. that was awesome. they were so cute... but they reeked of fish... duh... hmmmm the maze place where we got lost. markets were heaps fun. a cruise on the west coast was really pretty, if cold.. lavender farm.... smelt really nice. oh yeah... and the chocolate place. not cadbury though. the views!!!!!!!   lowlights? driving around.... the walking.... but they were worth it for the views. some dodgy accomodation. but nothing else. oh yeah. when my dad stuffed a whole roll of film... 2 days worth of photos poofed into nothing! =/  well, after a tassie adventure, you'd think that coming back here would really suk.... but i'm already getting into the routine of being bored all the time... only that school starts soon... which means so does clarinet and piano.... tonight and tomorrow... so i'd better go and ractice... *sigh*... =)

      went to the city to see the lights on sunday night. to be honest, they weren't anything that great... just buildings with coloured lights on them. the only good thing? the harbour bridge. the lights are kind of like the lights that were on the harbour bridge on new years... except not as funky.... there were some good displays... but mostly it was a little boring...  my mum has taken out all the fun of going back to school. she went to officeworks yesterday and she bought all of my stuff. now i don't get to go and go "ooohhhh i want that... and i don't think i need that but i'll get it anyway." =( it's not fair... i love going back to school shopping... it's fun! =) its the only good thing about going back...  not sure i can go on thursday... unless i change the movie to friday...? candelle? what do you think? friday? coz i realy really want to see honey.. but it comes out on thursday... and it'll probably be really crowded... =/ will call you... one day! =)  holidays almost over... or so it seems... the nz people are coming back... but then i'll be going... yay!

      watched popular the other day and the episode was like "a chirstmas carol" and the popular girl was scrooge... ANYWAY  i ended up going to see brother bear... it was pretty good! cryable at some parts... dodgy in others. after that we went to the choos' place and had lunch. pizz, mini pizza and pasta... trivial pursuit and beauty and the beast watching it again reminds me of all those 'old' disney movies... =)  new years eve was spent with dinner at uncle edwins and then the yeos came over to my house... so we could escape from the bad memories of church anniversary dinner.... =) fireworks weren't so great... was waiting for the little picture to come on the bridge.... and then it didn't come.. instead, there were stupid disco lights. ok, they weren't that bad... and actually kinda nice... but STILL! what happened to tradition! =/  yesterday, we went to the yeos for lunch and ended up staying there for ages... coz we watched the two towers... lotr... and then we ended up staying for dinner! =)  woke up too early this morning. couldn't sleep... so i woke up at 6.. and then at 6:30 i watched idol... which i am currently working myself all up over.... =(  my holidays are still boring... might be able to go and see elf with candelle... parents still mulling over the decision... *sigh*

      If you were bothered to wake up at 6:00 this morning to watch World Idol results show, you would have seen that Guy Sebastian, yes, our favourite (and only) idol, did not win the title. He did not even come in the top 5 or the top 6. He came 7th. Contrary to news reports, yes, I'm sorry to say this, but he did not come 6th. He came 7th. It is a national tragedy and today should be declared a national day of mourning.

      There are these things called secrets, and most people hate them, especially when they have no idea what the secrets are. Then there are the people who tell everyone everyone's secrets, the people who have to be the first to know everything. Then you have friends. Friends are the people that you share your secrets with... but then again, you have to have this thing called TRUST, which can sometimes be hard, especially if that friend has let you down before... But trust is a pretty important thing in all relationships... so you shouldn't be afraid to trust. I'm letting go and trusting my friends with stuff that I probably never would have trusted them with before... And I guess I'm not really all that ashamed to say it either.  so:TRUST!!!!

      if you have dreams, you have hope. if you have hope then that is more than you could even understand. keep dreaming. once you stop dreaming, you will have nothing to look forward to in life.

      today i met some of my old friends from dural... who now go to ruse. i can't help but wonder, what if... we had never left dural. would we all still be friends and stuff, or would we eventually drift apart. i remember years 5 and 6 pretty well. although there were those people who DID piss me off, it wasn't as if i couldn't put up with it... everything was just.... perfect. we all got along pretty well, and now... well, now we barely even talk. it's kinda sad really. sometimes, i think that it would have been better if we had never left the security of primary school, where there weren't any dramas, and all we did was just dream. now, it's like we've been exposed to the world, well, not quite, but that now we can see that there is a small thin line between people, that line that shows who's in and who's not. not that i care, i'm happy where i am at school, at that's the reason why i wouldn't want to go back. i ahve great friends now, old friends still occupying a little space inside of me, but i guess you could just say that i'm looking forward to the future, reminiscing about the old friends. people change, drift apart, i guess there's nothing you can really do about it. if we didn't change, we would never become the people who we are.    "When one door of happiness closes, another opens; but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one which has opened for us."  -Helen Keller    so to all my friends, old and new, i love you all, and thanks for being there for me! =)

      Hey all! I haven't written for AGES!!!!! I've been on the net heaps… but I just haven't quite managed to jot down a few things… Let's see… what's happened lately? Hmmmm….  Ok. well, friends of ours from HK came and we took them out to the Hunter Valley… that was last last week… I think. Then we went out with them for dinner heaps. Well, the daughter is now boarding at PLC and we've been to visit her there a few times. I think it's pretty cool, but she's really homesick so things haven't been that great for her. I think she's getting used to it, but we're taking her out on Saturday… don't know where though… Well, school's started and most of my teachers are ok… I guess… maths is kinda freaky with all these majorly smart people… and we already have three assignments… but I guess it's almost the same as last year.  What else? Hmmmmm…. We went to the Yeo's place the other day and got to watch some of Finding Nemo! =) Had this REALLY yummy mango pudding! =) =) Well.. I'm not sure what else to write, seeing as there's nothing much going on in my life…. *sigh*

      yay!   anyway... i'm bored... i have to find out all this stuff for our geo assignment whish is due on MONDAY!!!! ahhhh *gasp* help!    DAY 1~ Thursday, 22nd January  Today, Mel and I woke up pretty early, because we had to drive out to Ayers Rock/Uluru for the beginning of our holiday. The drive there took us 5 ½ hours. I was surprised at how good the roads were. I half expected a dirt road that would be bumpy and uncomfortable, but it was actually quite smooth. The landscape was so different to that of the city. Even Alice Springs had a very different landscape. It made me realise the isolation of Uluru.  By the time we got there, it was midday, too hot to even try to walk anywhere, so we went to the Kata Tjuta Cultural Center, Here we learned a lot about the Aboriginal culture. There were heaps of displays and stuff as well as a guide who took us around and explained the significance of everything. It's quite amazing how everything fits into the Aboriginal culture, from their art, to their weapons and even their way of life. It reminded me how just by being here, the rest of us have somehow invaded into their previously simple way of life. At the Center, we ate a traditional Aboriginal meal for lunch, which was pretty interesting, because we had foods like kangaroo and emu, which neither of us have ever tried before.   that's all i have so far... *sigh* better get to work... see what i mean about discipline?!?!  oh.. one more thing: ARGH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (jay, you know EXACTLY what i mean!)

      since i can't eat much... i have been reduced to the basics... bread, water... and hot cross buns!! it amazes me how shops and businesses find easter such a money making time, what with chocolate, easter eggs and hot cross buns, that easter starts to lose its true meaning...  easter is a really important time, coz it's when Jesus died on the cross, for us, so that we could have a relationship with God. so i get happy around easter time, not because i'm happy He suffered, but because i am reminded how much He loves me!!! =) I AM LOVED!!!!! =)  yay!

      i was just thinking.. where will we all be 10 years from now?......... scary thought, huh? i would have most likely finished uni... and be working... some of you might be married??? who knows... but then you think about it and wonder if God'll cut your life short... call you back. if that happens, will you feel like you've achieved everything you could possibly achieve in your life? or would you regret soem of the stuff that you never did. stuff you never said to people. simple words like: "i love you" or "sorry for..." or "i'm glad you're here". think about it.   now i have to have an 'early' night.. though my definition of early may be SLIGHTLY different to yours.... =)

      someone called me unworthy today...          and it made me think of the ultimate sacrifice. Jesus. I was way way unworthy for what He did for me. He DIED for me... ME! The unworthy... so then it made me think. What can I do to become worthy? I know that there is no way that I could ever become worthy enough... but if I believe in Him and trust Him and let Him guide me, I think that I might be on the right track...  So... I think I WILL go to the baptism class, just to get a feel for things... not saying that I'm actually going to get baptised... but we'll see...

      we're learning about nazi germany in english... in this book that we're reading called the wave by morton rhue. its really freaky, and we've been told to find out about hitler and stuff, and the stuff that happened just puts you into a state of numbness. i cant believe that someone would do anything like that... experiments with the twins at auschwitz and stuff.. that's really harsh... and then the killing of everyone... and the whole dictatorship thing!?!? its kinda scary... you think that it could never happen to you... and then it almost happened in palo alto, california, in 1969....

      We had our geography half yearly yesterday. I think I did ok, only that I didn't know where Torres Strait was. I just labelled it at the top, knowing it was somewhere around there, but it's near the Queensland tip… oh wellz! I think I've gone ok. I'm just worried about my maths one. I mean I left out some questions, guessed a couple and wasn't positive about the rest. Go figure…  Happy birthday Joel! Now I have no idea what to get you… just talked to Jeanne. Maybe you might not get it on Sunday…  Had a band rehearsal from P3-6 today… missed out on double science, pd and geo, yet I still managed to accumulate 2 periods of homework… out of the 4 periods I went to!! *sigh* it was a bludge though, rehearsal…  We caught the 2503 today… and it was completely empty. It was a really nice buss too. One of the buses that we had way back in year 7 with the disabled persons seats that fold up and down. It was just me, Shanaya, Stef, Siobhan, Em and a whole bus all to ourselves. Too bad there was some truck that had broken down. We all got off at Towers… went to the newsagents… I've finally read the article that Amanda said that she was in. I agree… it wasn't all that interesting after all… but I reckon it's still kinda cool that she was in a magazine. Then we remembered that my dad was coming to pick us up. we went over to the usual meeting place, and he wasn't there. Went to ring my mum, coz I'm so impatient, and she rang Dad, but he was already there. Got home, clarinet… bleh  No more long blogs. Can't be bothered anymore.

      Well, Jasmine left Idol today… I thought that I would be happy to see her go, after it was her that made La Toya leave… but it was still pretty sad. It was good to see that she didn't do a whole crying thing again. The bad thing is, now I'm not so sure if Diana will win. I mean, Fantasia got all good comments, and Diana only got good comments on the last song [which I've never heard before, and really like]… *sigh*   Geography test tomorrow… but we also have strike from 9-11…. *sigh* still, better finish up all my notes. I'm actually writing this before I go on the net, coz I know I will take ages to type this whole thing up. And then I won't waste time typing this when I have to research some stuff for geo. *sigh* wet and dry sclerophyll…   After so many long-ish entries I kinda feel bad for not writing much… but oh wellz… at least you don't have to feel guilty about not commenting.. coz there's nothing really to comment on…*sigh*

      got to skip period 6 and some of period 7 to listen to some guy talk to us about "making a plan".  eric bailey was born in down town LA. he was almost blind in his right eye, and couldn't read or write. his was constantly told that he was a loser and would never succeed. he had a growth disease that made him grow 2" every week. when he was 10, he went to a party to try and be cool. some guys came and started shooting and he made himself a plan, realising how short life could be. he then tried to go home, but police were there. when he thought that they had gone, he got out but a policeman saw him. they took him and asked him why he was there. he told them the truth, and they beat him and left him with his nose, ribs broken, lungs punctured, and unconcious. he waited for an hour before the paramedics came. before they did, he heard the voice of a girl he'd met tell him not to give up. she had been shot three times and died by his side.  at 12, he decided to achieve his dream- of becoming a pro baller. he ended up playing in the NBA [can't remember the team] but was then fired after playing what he thought was the best game of his life. he then transferred to tasmania to play. he moved to melbourne and then queensland. he was told that he would never play sport, that he would never be successful... now he has retired and works with celebs like jlo, mariah, 50 cent, will smith.   motivational? *sigh* i dunno. some people got free bballs... *sigh* oh wellz... i think it was pretty cool.. though you can't really be sure if his life was at bad as he says it is... but then again, some people do have pretty crap lives...  we did our science half yearly today... i think i did ok... not sure about some of the questions... got maths tomorrow... i hope i do ok.. past years' commons were pretty easy... but i don't want to be too confident, coz then i screw up... =/  my mum's done a joel... fame, great china circus, monet to moore [some art thing], cats, cirque du soleil [imax], sydney north dance festival, peter pan, hills district music festival, saltimbanco, beauty and the beast... interesting... i remember all of them except the great china circus.. i've actually been to a proper circus?!? *sigh*  imagine if the only people left alive were teenagers... imagine the chaos and lack of order there would be... reading a book that shanaya lent me... a series about what a bunch of teens do when they realise that there are no adults, no rules, no authority. it's quite interesting...   i'm going to go on a whinge about being so procrastinating... coz i really should be revising my maths... i've only had to have jackie explain the negative indices thing to me about 20 times... *sigh* i always do all my study at the very last minute... and then when it gets to aroud 1 the morning of the test, i freak out and start doing some major study... i'm gonna agree with jay about the wanting to stay in school... don't even want to think about the hsc, coz it's just freaking me out. it used to seem so far away, and now it seems really close... *sigh* who am i to talk? i feel sorry for those people in yr 12 right now... it's not really that easy to cram and stuff for the hsc is it? that's how i've been coping for teh past two and a bit years.... i always say that i'm going to change, but do i? no... i don't really  have as muich of an excuse as jay to be going on about all of this... but i am anyway.. coz i'm on the net,, and i can''t be bothered to go and do my maths... *sigh* it's in period 6... so we still have recess... i still have recess to bug people about how to do stuff... or sometimes people buggin me about how to do stuff... and me kinda not telling them the exact right thing... not on purpose.. but because i think i know.. but then i remember that what i told them is something else... i hope i end up developing good study habits... coz at the rate i'm going... my future ain't looking too bright... =/  *Sigh* i really hate commons... and half yearlies... they ruin what could have been a perfectly good term... *sigh*  must remember to tell mrs. dowler about going to perth... hmmm....  NOTE TO SELF: tell mrs dowler about going to perth...  yeah, like that's going to do anything... *Sigh* i sigh WAY too much nowadays... maybe it's just the lack of something constructive to say... not that "*sigh*" is constructive... but you get what i mean right...   why does it feel like i'm doing a jay? obviously not as much as her... but still heaps... maybe i don't really have much of a life after all... i mean, it's not like i talk to many people.. and not that many people talk to me. and the people i DO talk to, tell me gross stuff about samuel getting dakked... *cough* JAY *cough*  i have done a world first: i've gone on the internet way more in a week than my mum has. she's been at home this WHOLE week and hasn't been on the net for even 10 minutes! i feel like i've accomplished something..... hehehe.   trying to give jay a crash course in maths... but it doesn't seem to be working... do you know how hard it is to explain surds over the net?!?!? *sigh* i think she understands now... but i'm not sure...  it's getting colder and colder. i hate the cold. it makes you all cold... and i have some weird problem and my toes swell and they get all painful and red... it's kinda gross to think about... so i won't pollute your mind with such images...   getting my camp photos on saturday... looking forward to having a look... can't really remember what i took now... but it should be cool. got a free double set from kmart... go kmart... yay! so now i can do some school friends thing with the doubles... *srhug* maybe in the holidays... when i get my creativity streak going... heheheh! =) trish brought hers in today... lots of lisa and aaron... but we don't really need to go there...   hmmmm. i'm hungry. there's nothing to eat at my house.. just got my braces tightened yesterday so i can't eat anything... yeah, the pain has decided to come back now... and to think i thought i would never see him again.. =/ oh wellz...  are there things that should never be said and things that should always be said in open? *Shrug* i dunno... stuff that you don't rally want to tell anyone... but you think you should before it's too late... *srhug* i have no idea what i'm going about... if you people who read this comment about soemthing.. please not let it be this paragraph!  gah! i'm molting everywhere!!! i hate hair! ok. so i don't... but its frustrating... and annoying... and...-  finishing... right now... *clicks "publish post"*

      it's such a good song... and now both pya and jay have gotten me hooked into simple plan... but the song is true... not all of it.. but some of it...    pressure   to do well,  to succeed,  to be better than everyone else, to accomplish, to be perfect... to be someone, something, you're not   got science half yearly tomorrow... wich i could be like jay and become conveniently sick! =)  Phagocytosis --> when white blood cells [phagocytes] see and destroy pathogens. The phagocytes engulf the bacteria and a vacuole forms inside the phagocyte, around the pathogen. Enzymes in the vacuole destroy the pathogen. Inflammation --> blood vessels increase in size so that more phagocytes can enter, so that the pathogen cannot spread and infect other areas.  This is all the second line of defence.  *sigh* i hate science.. and the english comp was today... we did a practice maths common... and it was suprisingly easy... which scares me...  i'm contemplating writing a whole lot of nothing, but my mum is about to come out and yell at me.. [it's 12:13] so i better not... sorry jay! you're just gonna have to wait for me to majorly exceed your number of words! [she has around 60,000 words for 60 entries... i have 15,000 words for 100 and some entries...]  hope fantasia gets out in idol... i never did have that huge rant about how latoya got voted out... *sigh* it's weird how things like that are so forgettable... but paulini now has a record deal with sony! =) yay! i like paulini... =)  re: a very old blog entry about idol and certain ppls...? auditions on 29th and 30th may! =) that's next next week... *hint hint* ? =)  that's gonna have to do for now... but wait, there's more...  went to see uncle daniel today... got the braces tightened. it's funny how i've suddenly, almost, forgotten about them... it's weird, eh? it's not like they're any less painful... just that i've gotten used to them? yay! =)  went to penno library today... they have finally decided to invest in some new books... just when i was about to stop going there altogther... =) they should get more new books to promote reading among younger children... blah blah blah... *shrug* that was my poor attempt at a lecture [?]  for those of you who have not yet seen the new layout [of which i am very happy about] please have a look and tell me what you think! i was about to leave my whole site coz the clouds were really getting to me... but now i have found a nice simple layout... no. make that, i have now made a nice simple layout... that isn't simplicity simple, but still looks nice... kinda like mary's dress... only not as elegant... yeah yeah. i'm so modest. but seriously, no one comments, so i have to make do with my own constructive 'criticism'.... =)  i have come to a conclusion that this blog is barely worth writing, if only for the lame excuse that someone out there cares.  and what is with blogger telling me that i'm a fish?!?! i ain't no fish! i carry the water! *sigh* i'm just on a high at the moment... but i better go and print out my beautiful notes.... and wash up the supper dishes...   mum: lindy? LINDY?!?! me: yeah... *continues typing out conversation*  ok... love yas all! =)

      wednesday~ went to school... and we got onto the bus to somerset... played sweet+sour and we sang heapsa songs. we were sitting at the back and the whole of the bus was basically guys and they had heaps of food, so we scabbed! =)  got to the camp place and we got divided up into out groups etc. got taught how to put up our tents... and harshi and i succeeded without it falling down! =) after lunch, we went abseiling, which was heaps of fun. i got freaked out first... but then it got fun. we walked around some of the bush bits while we were waiting. we had free time... and us chicks made a grassman, like a snowman... but with grass. spent half our time defending it from the guys who were trying to destroy it... dinner was pasta stuff, which wasn't actually too bad... then we played games with the other group that was staying there too. we had to go around and ask all the teachers and staff members if they were aa certain character and then we had to find all of the characters that we were told, until we had found nemo... it was a bit of a dodgy game... too much exercise! hehehe =) sleeping that night was really noisy. one of the guys in our group snored really loud and it was pretty uncomfortable...  thursday~  woke up at 6:30, too early. found all this grass on our clothes from wednesday's grassman making. it took us ages to pack our bags up again and stuff... so we were late to breakfast. after breakfast we went canoeing, which was heaps fun, except for the fact that we got our shoes so wet! but they were old shoes so it was all good! =) the river was really pretty and we had a sandcastle building competition! fun fun =) lunch, and then a very long bushwalk. 3 hours. it was pretty fun even though i was dead for the whole thing, basically. but it was very tiring. and more like a hike. met up with duke of ed-ers though, which was cool. then we got to our campsite and then we had to set up our tents and then us girls helped with dinner. the guys built up the fire and once it got going, it was SOOOOOOOOOOO warm! =) dinner was stew, which was better than the pasta in some respects... and we were playing this sing off thing... you get a topic, like colours and you have to think of as many songs as you can that have the word colours in it... or any of the colours in it. then you go around the groups singing one at a time, not repeating any that have already been said. it was really fun and we played for so long until we froze!=/ sleeping was better that night... though i could still hear whoever it was snoring... and it was FREEZING!!!!!!!!  friday~ woke up at 6:00!!!!! that's the earliest i have woken up without having ot set an alarm or rely on anyone else! it was SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOo cold in the tent! we got changed, packed our tent and our bags, then had breakfast, to be told that it was only 4 degrees!!!! never been that cold before... we had to walk back to camp, but we took the short way.. and then we went to do the low ropes course which was heaps fun, especially the flying fox!! =)  went to thee obstacle course after that and then the wombat hole. most of us didn't go in because there wouldn't ahve been enough time to change. it's basically a hole of mud/dirt. wasn't all that keen... =/ lunch and then we got shoved onto a bus... spent more time singing, but since it was less than half the grade on two buses, it wasn't very full. we didn't manage to get the back seats though. saw some very interesting signs on the way...: ~ BURNS pet food ~ turtle nursery ~ nathan's body repairing and painting ~ use other footpath [where there was no actual foot path] ~ sold by sale like i said... interesting... =) *yawn* need to sleep... but have to learn dictation for chinese tomorrow... then half yearlies next week.. *sigh*

      after 'excitement' of band camp... it felt weird to be back at school. it was a good thing that we didn't have band this morning or else i would have been dead.  had my commerce test first up this morning and i am postive that i screwed up at least a quarter of it. got really frustrated. recess, then pe. bball! indoor! we did mostly skills and stuff but played a really short game at the end. was quite interesting! =P english and more romeo and juliet. and then boring computing. [my day's been sounding so interesting so far, hasn't it?] lunch and did a couple of 'interesting' things~ office to look at the ugly designs of new pe shirts [ick!], got newsletter [missed roll call coz of commerce test], got half of my science assignment checked, went up to music to return lisa's chocolate money [that she sold for me] and got two more boxes. then the bell rang, so we had to quickly split the carmellos and freddos. geo was bludgy but still managed to finish my work. maths was dead boring. came home [bus was REALLY early] and watched my er from thursday. showered, slept, dinner-ed. mum said to make back up files on disks coz there's a huge virus going around. so i did that, and found that i had a whole lot of junk. deleted some crap... then came on the net to do this STUPID science assignment.  found out that our half yearlies are on the week after camp... which is really crap because how are we supposed to study?!? we're going to be dead the whole weekend! stupid teachers and exam co-ordinators. *sigh*  it's 11:22 PM and my mum is yelling at me to go to sleep and to make sure that i do a bunch of stuff. i think i shall stay on until 11:45 and then get off...

      band camp was really fun!!!!! got to miss out on my commerce test! though i still have to do it tomorrow...  highlights~ -- it was heaps cool coz we learnt two new pieces... which were a little more difficult than the stuff that we're used to... potc music and of pride and celebration. we also got a new piece... spongebob squarepants!! hehehe... the music was pretty challenging too.. but we had so many rehearsals and stuff... so we've come out of band camp really well... except of course for the people who didn't go... =/ -- we watched potc on the saturday night... it was great to rewatch the movie! =) i've started to understand the whole curse in it now... before i was just like "yeah, i totally get what's happening..." -- volleyball was heaps fun with heather and bec... and the year 7s and 8s... until heather's volleyball got chucked into the 'dam'... three times.... =/ bobbie/bobby.... (*shrug*) and bobby went out in the canoe to get it... it was quite funny... played heaps until my arms were sore... and then we went inside and played heater volleyball... but that's a long story... =) -- a bunch of the year 8 girls collected 50 bucks from everyone to go towards the senior band tour... in exchange for our band conductor's permission to make him up.... so they put all this make up all over him.. and it was quite ugly... but very very funny! =) lowlights~ -- the food... vision valley food is always exactly the same... and the pancakes we had on saturday morning made me sick... i felt like throwing up after... but then i got better... the only good thing about it... was that they had good slices and stuff for morning and afternoon tea... and yummy  hundreds and thousands biscuits! =) -- having to play so much... but it was all worth it in the end...   came home.. and i missed the beginning of american idol... and then john stevens got voted out.... =( it was so sad.. coz the song was really sad too.... i admit it... i cried.... =/... but i think i would have rathered him to go than george...........  now i am SUPPOSED to be doing my science and i think i shall do it.. because i wanna check with our teacher and ask her if i have enough info for the test... =/

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!   last parting words:  i will see you when i see you if i see you i will see you if i miss you i will miss you never will i forget you.  and He will be with you while I am not.  while my angels are not around me, He will see me through.   miss ya... love ya... hate ya... miss ya.

      You're dumped by your piano teacher of almost 9 years. You thought that you would be happy, since you can't really stand her, but you find yourself in tears. She's willing to give you another chance, as long as you up the practice. A lot. What do you do?  You find yourself wondering whether or not your group of friends is falling apart. You find yourself realising that things are changing, no matter what you want. You begin to understand that change is sometimes a good thing. What is you don't want them to change?  You fall in love… and get really confused. You have no idea what to do… besides, he doesn't really realise that you exist. Should you leave things as they are? Or should you find out the truth, even if it hurts? [please, people who DO know what I'm talking about, no references to people if you are going to comment…]  Your "best friend's" birthday is today [HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!] and despite the fact that you have known her for more than half your life, you don't know what to get her. [I'm sorry if the "best friend" thing offends you… but you've gotta admit that we don't really know where we stand with each other anymore… =( love ya anywayz! *muahz*]  You begin to understand the value of time and how precious it is. You realise that it is something cannot be wasted. You've been given a lecture by your 'mother' and now have come to realise, that although you threatened to stop blogging, you might soon have to refrain from writing in the second person, as well as the first… and give up lame poetry altogether, maybe for the benefit of everyone else!   So, without much ado, I will leave you, who knows for how long, until I learn to manage my time, WITHOUT procrastinating. Also, I'm leaving for Perth in 6 days. Until I next blog, farewell, my friends. I will write of my adventures when I return.   [[Shrek 2 on Sunday!!! *woot woot* =) =) =) Bec, I have absolutely NO idea what to get you!!!! Joel and Pat, Happy Anniversary yesterday! =) I've shoved a staple into my middle finger!!! Ouchies! =( *sigh* English Essay finished… *woot woot* No procrastination? Pssh! =) Love and Peace to you all… yes, yes, WAY too happy today! No poetry for you all… Don't be so happy or anything! =) ]]

      cookies and cream made into tea cookies and cream yummy for me!  walking along, no footsteps walking with me. trying out this thing called independence. taking a stand  for myself wondering how  i will survive.  carrying on, with our busy lives, too busy to take time, to realise, that we're pushing away the ones that we love. i understand  that time's flying by, and it's ok, coz you don't have to put it in words. i already know you care. =)  she listens to him, unsure of whether she wants to know. and in answer to her question, he answers, she breathes in, "i love you"  flowers contain such a simple message: an "i love you" or "get well soon". if you understand the symbolism of a simple bunch of flowers i can guarantee that you'll smile for hours.  =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =) =)  poetry in a world of words expresses much more emotion than any essay or story it shows the true feelings of someone who's lost who just wants to be themselves free from anything holding them back but when the poet has friends there's no need for poetry coz the friends already know and understand how she feels, or at least she hopes they do! =)

      i have a feeling that i shouldn't write too much stuff like the previous poems... getting too many questions and weird comments from anonymous people. getting freaked! =) jill's party was awesome today!!! when we went to harshi's in the morning, we thought that we were gonna have heaps of time, but we ended up getting really rushed. jay at first couldn't figure out how to curl my hair, but we eventually figured that we just had to leave it in for longer. then jessie came over, and we were trying to do her hair... only that it refused to stay up... benji on a lazy day! hehehe... then we were late to jill's party, but i was getting used to the curls. [i like, but my parents don't... back to that convo about me changing my hair...] watched el dorado and extended lion king. v. good. had a cool treasure hunt... with chocolates and stuff.. but it was in the dark so we all had to have torches. oh yeah, jill's cake was REALLY yummy!!! then watched the rest of them play my/michelle's game... which was interesting, considering that stef had NO idea who half the people were... then came home... to do my english essay, which i am still only a third way through.. *sigh*  oh yeah, watched harry potter 3 on saturday. it was pretty good, i think better than the first two. *shrug* but others think differently. i believe that rach has transmitted her ron disease to me!!!! =) though not rupert grint, can't stand his hair at the moment... yeesh!   since i am not i a very poetry mood, i will refrain, and continue along my merry way with my stupid romeo and juliet essay.... *sigh*

      what if the sun didn't rise tomorrow? what if there was no happiness, only sorrow? what if this life was taken away? what if this love was never given a say? would i regret not speaking louder? would i regret not shouting out? maybe it's too late to say a thing, maybe it's too late to do anything about it. i just wanna give up, but can't give up on the memories. i just wanna let go, but can't let go of a piece of me. the feeling's to0 hard to say goodbye to, it wouldn't be fair on me. i guess i want what's best for you, even if it's not me. i'll take a back seat, and watch you be happy,  coz i know that it's better that way. just always remember that you were my first, and only, love.

      ~~Your name of  Lindy  has given you an idealistic nature with a desire to help others. Your initiative often causes you to be the first to act when you see a need. Since you are impressionable and receptive, you feel the misfortunes of others very keenly. However, this name makes it awkward for you to express your deeper thoughts and feelings with finesse and diplomacy to the extent that your candid, sometimes blunt, manner of speaking creates misunderstandings with others. Being somewhat self-centred, you learn through your own experiences, as you rarely take advice from others. Yet, you are sensitive and very easily hurt and offended. You long for praise and appreciation for your efforts, but others find it difficult to understand you.~~  why does that sound ALOT like me?!?!? self centred, rarely take advice from others, sometimes blunt manner of speaking...   urlLink http://www.kabalarians.com

      comments not working.. first comment in AGES>>> understand my joy?! =) and now my frustration to find that it won't OPEN!!!!  athletics carnival... it's been fun fun!!!... hehehez...   happy birthday to harshi and mel!! party was fun wasn't it mel? looking forward to yours harshi.. even if i don't want to see shrek 2 =P heheh... =)  hmm... *sigh* i really really really really want to quit chinese right now. we have our written exam this week, and i'm forfeitting what was supposed to be a girl's night... but now i have to study for it. i already know i'm going to FAIL!!! and this is not one of those things i do just to make myself feel better when i get ok... this is the TRUTH!!!! ARGH!!!!   frustration sets in as her mind calculates. it's only 3 days away, and she doesn't know what to do. people think she knows everything, but her mum always helps her. she's not used to failing,  it's just not done in her life. she doesn't think she can just accept it, so why won't they let her run away. tears fall down her face, as dreads the impending days. the days that will be filled with study, study that she can't fit into her head. she's scared she'll let them all down, but who is she really doing this for? them?  or herself? she stops, asking herself this question. does she really believe it's for them? or is she lying to herself? is it really for her? she wants to do well to please them, but also to remain above the bar. that's for herself, right? suddenly she realises why she's willing to try, because she wants to be perfect, but she can't. no one's perfect, no one can TRY to be perfect. everyone just is. and no matter what she does, she can only be herself.

      someone take my hand, and lead me. i don't care where we go, just guide me away. can't deal with what's here, too scared to run away. i place my trust in you. take me to a place, where i can forget, forget everything: life love pain someone reach out, and take me. i will willingly go, just keep me safe. i need to get away, from everything. it's all too much. all i want  is the hurt to end, for the pain to disappear.     in God i trust.

      if life was a playground i would have already tripped and fallen. i would have a graze on my knee, proof of where i fell. if life was a battlefield i think i would be dead. i think i would have wounded my comrades.  love lies to her face, making her believe in something, deep down she knows is false. she holds on to the lifeline, that love has thrown her, but it doesn't float. she sinks with it, down into the depths of the ocean, like the titanic. love laughs as she struggles to stay afloat, then life gives her a second chance, and she is rescued by a life boat. from that day onward she becomes scared of love, but falls in to its arms the very next day. she needs to learn to let go, but it all seems too good to give up. she keeps hoping and waiting, for a day when he will find her, and read her heart, and understand what's in her mind. she waits a lifetime away, waiting for that special moment. she doesn't stop to think, if it could all be too late, that he may have already fallen into the arms of love, though not the arms of love that she offers. she knows what she must do. she must let him know the truth, but how? she gets too nervous around him. talking to him makes her stammer and squeak. her hands get clammy, she avoids his eyes. she suspects that he knows, and that he doesn't know how to tell her the truth, that he doesn't love her. but she must keep holding on, holding on the lifeline,  that love has thrown her. she can't give up, not yet, not now. so she holds on. her arms get tired, her muscles get sore, but she won't let go, it's been too long to just forget it all. so she holds on, and hopes, hoping that one day he will tell her  the words she wants to hear: "i love you, i always have, and i always will."

      things are changing but she's scared. scared of what might happen scared of the future, HER future. her life has been nothing but a game, but now she must learn. she must learn to learn from her mistakes, the mistakes of which she has made many. time scares her, the second hand on the clock, slowly ticking away, ticking away each second she lives on this earth. has she accomplished anything in life? or will she be destined to a life of nothing. her spirit crumples under the weight of her thoughts, thoughts which she thought she could never express. she builds up a courage to tell the ones who listen, but they've turned a deaf ear, not seeming to care about her. she feels alone in the world with no one really seeming to care. they come and go, passing by quickly. stopping just long enough  for her to tell them some but then they're gone,  just like that. she's been pushed aside, friends thinking that she'll always be there. maybe things should start to change, change for the better.

      bleh...  people don't seem to want to have anything to with me... i mean, look at the convos people start... but then they just stop replying... or else they start talking on the phone and give you about 10 'brb's in a matter of 5 minutes... *sigh*  i guess i'm so boring... and you wonder why?!?  i'm so not in a poem-y mood atm... i feel like writing a poem... but can't... just can't get everything out.. considering it's pretty pointless from my point anyway... not because i want everyone to read it... but because i don't really want them to... =/  i don't think it matters, what i say or do. the words i type, don't seem to be true. they think i want attention [?], but it's what i really feel. can't they understand? what's their problem, their deal? we used to be close, or closer than some. but when i needed them, they were to scared to come. all i need now is a friend, to comfort and to hold me, a friend that will be long standing, who will never be scared to be, the friend i look for, in my times of need, the friend i look for, when i need someone to lead. if being me is just scaring everyone away, what must i do to get someone to stay?  bleh that sucks... will go back to only writing my poetry when i am in a 'depressed' mood.... =/

       We all carry around so much pain in our hearts. Love and pain and beauty. They all seem to go together like one little tidy confusing package. It's a messy business, life. It's hard to figure--full of surprises. Some good. Some bad.  ~Henry Bromel, Northern Exposure, The Big Kiss, 1991  ionno... just looking up a bunch of quotes... i think that life is something we live... because most people are to scared to end it. love is what propels us to keep living, in the hope that we find someone to love... and someone who will love us back.  life is a journey that changes with each individual person. to live life is a blessing... carpe diem~ seize the day. don't live your life crap... make something of it... love is something that screws with our minds. when we're in it, we complain... when we're out of it... we complain. only when we receive enough love to make ourselves live, are we able to continue living without regrets... life is a blessing, given to us so that we might make something of it... love is what we are given so we have the will to live. life and love go hand in hand. without love, there is no purpose for life. without life, no love is possible.  keep living life... always expecting that around the corner you may find love.>>

      oh wellz... i'm back... it lasted for... less than a day... oh wellz...  and then understanding dawns on her, like a sunrise spreading its rays over the land. she realises that she's been stupid, an idiot, not realising that she is surrounded by those who love her. as if waking up from a dream, her previous life seems surreal. she knows all too well that it might come back, but she tries to keep it away, away from the front of her mind. yet she knows that the feeling still haunts her. she is not able to run away, no matter how fast, how far she runs. it will always follow, that feeling of despair and of unrequited love. but there will be a way around it. she needs to move on, learn to forget the love that weighs her down. it's hard, but she tries. she tries so hard... but she can't forget. too many years have passed. she's lost her chance to forget. she wishes she could, but it's impossible. to let go of what is in her heart, would be to let go of part of herself. she treasures those memories too much, to just let them fly away. the memories weren't much,  just glimpses into what might have been. but now she focuses on those who love her, those who care about her, about how she feels. sometimes she just can't talk about it, but they know her too well to let that stand between them. they understand her more than she will ever understand herself. she needs them, but doesn't know how to tell them. she wants to thank them but the words don't come out. her mouth forms those two words, and she whispers them, testing them. " thank you " her words are carried away,  by an invisible source, but she knows that they will reach the ears for whom they were meant for. love was said to conquer all, but it is a matter of which love that will conquer, the love of a partner, or the love of a friend?  i think making up weird and depressing sounding poems helps everythng come out better? but i'm not depressed depressed, ok? just pondering... about nothing... pointless... trying to let go. =/

      there is no purpose, no sense in life, everything changes, but you can't take control. you live life,  day in, day out, breathing, walking, talking, never stopping to think, how it all works, how it all fits in.  would it be possible, to let someone else lead you, lead you away from the hurts, the pains. will someone take my hand, lead me, guide me. i'm too confused to find my way, lost on this road called Life. it never ends, until the last day, when He comes to claim me, or cast me away. who am i to know  the great scheme of things? nothing more than a girl, a girl who's lost and can't find her way, a girl who struggles to understand. someone lead me, please before i fall away,  from the path they tell me to stay on.  there's not enough time to do anything it doesn't stop for you won't rewind for you. once, just once, stop and i will make the most of it. make the most of the time i've been given, to let love fly free, to rid myself of the pain. not now, though, it's too early but might it be too late?  someone guide me, show me the right way to go help me find the narrow path that will lead me to the light. not sure if i'm on the right path just walking, waiting, waiting for the day,  when all will be right.  the truth hurts, but sometimes it's better to know or i will find myself hurting forever. or will i find the truth that's good, that's true that brings happiness into my shadows. maybe i should let it lie, let love run its course or should i disturb the ever running flow, of a river of love that cannot be stopped, unless by the truth, the truth that hurts.  will it be enough for me to say sorry to act like it was all a game or does it go deeper than that? deep into the fortress of the city that is me. the walls are slowly being crumbled by an unexpected attack. the builders work overtime, making sure the forces don't break through. but maybe there might be a time, when they give up, give in, and only then will the city surrender, to the attackers, the army, to the person that is just trying to help, to help her find herself.  this life is so ordinary. nothing more than a window, into someone else's life. have i done anything? have i affected anyone? must i always be just there, living my life like the next person. no one special just ordinary, plain. can i make something of this life? or will i regret not living it?  friends come and go, some never leaving footprints. one or two come, and you never want them to leave, but they're already in the boat, about to cast off. you hold the boat, not wanting to let go. then you grow weak,  and have no choice. you watch them float away.  there is no purpose,  no sense in life. you ask questions that go unheard, think thoughts that sound absurd. you go around and around in circles, get dizzy. then fall.        fall.          fall.           fall... all the way  d o w n .

      This is an outrage to women! And you wonder why there are eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia! Promoting the 'ideal' image: thin, tall, beautiful. A competition, where fakeness and 'All I want is world peace' prevails, proves nothing, except that the people who show the most flesh, are skinny, with Barbie-doll waists, are the ones who win fame and fortune, and the one who gets an opportunity to 'do what they love, that is, helping people'. All Miss Universe is, is a glorified fashion parade, where the grand prize is the title: Miss Universe.  The judges are judging on? All the female judges are previous models or fashion experts, so are going to favour the pretty, beautiful women. All the male judges? Do we even need to go there?!? 'Beauty Pageants' are degrading to women who aren't 'ideal', who aren't beautiful, skinny. What happens to the people who aren't pretty? Ever wondered how they feel? In conclusion, I believe that competitions like Miss Universe are degrading to women, with the competitors flaunting their sex appeal.  There. Now... I would start ranting and raving on something else... but the ad break on Channel 7 just finished... =) hehehe...

      i always wondered how i'd get through this life that i have known without someone to stand beside me and guide me through all the troubles. but then i thought again of my Father who brought me here and He's always standing next to me watching to catch me when i fall or stumble.  i don't think i ever stopped to thank Him or even noticed that He was there but now that i know this fact i've gotta learn not to take Him for granted. i've always known about his sacrifice for me but never really cared but now i think the time has come for me to sit down and think.  He gave his son's life for me for many others too but i don't think i ever thanked Him for the payment that He paid. He's freed me from my sin so that i can be with Him He loves me more than i can understand and he wants me to be with Him.  so when the time comes for me to leave i'll know where i'll be going coz He's prepared a place for me to be with Him where He lives. at times i must admit i'm scared to leave this life i've known but it should just be the same later with Him leading me as i go.

      well, after deciding that i have no idea how to get everything out... i thought that i missed this blog, so i have come back again to do what i used to do before i discovered poetry.... completely boring "and today i did this" entries...  obligation and guillt is a horrible thing. i sooo did not want to use my last day of holidays on a band rehearsal... but my obligation and guilt kicked in... stupid stupid... anyway... so i spent 3 hours at school... on a school development/pupil free day... *sigh* oh wellz.. this whole tour this is sounding good! =) yupz! we're going to the central coast!!! =)   we went to dinner with francesca and her family yesterday night... we went to the city to golden court... and we had all this really feast-y sorta food... it was all good... but sort of... i dunno... *shrug*  well, way2go was fun yesterday too... the kids seemed to have heaps of fun with our inventive games.... or rather, amy's games... =) and then the teacher/workers v. kids... hehehe... what i view as hilarious, but entirely pointless! =)  and then we begin again tomorrow... back into the routine of school, homework, and piano lessons... *sigh* at least i think there are still piano lessons... =/ and i havent seen anyone for AGES!!!! 3 weeks! man... i need to get out more...

      i just want an excuse to type... i've missed typing anything for my WHOLE holiday... but now i'm back!!! =) =) =)   anywayz... well, i'm not gonna give you a whole recount of my trip, coz that would take too long. however, i do give you permission to ask me for my 'travel journal' thing that i wrote everything in... with a  coupla msgs to certain people... and if you're not one of those ppl... sorry!!! it's not that i wasn't thinking of you... it's most probably because i didn't really know what to say... or i sorta just fell asleep half way throught the entry! =/   ok. i will do highlights and lowlights.. hummz.... highlights~~ dolphins... sooo cute! =) =) =)  staying in hotels/motels landing after being in the plane for how ever long it was we were in there!!!  umm....  sleeping during the incredibly long drives smelling rain again! collecting soaps and shampoos coming home! =) i love my bed  lowlights~~ um... rain... coz we couldnt see anything when we were driving lack of internet coming home... i wanna see the rest of the world!!! but that has nothing to do with this holiday... *shrug*  um....  cant really think of anything else....  wellz.... that's about it. now i have to do a whole bunch of homework that i sooo stupidly collected before i left.... *sigh* so i'll get back to you one day yeah?  been thinking about you dunno what to do now it's been so long should i really try and change everything? or leaving everything the same including the pain i feel  everytime i see you but you've never known so should i just let you know even if i don't have the guts to say anything that will make sense to tell you the truth  bleh... losing it.  things try to come out but they only come out like this in poems the essence of words formed together in a string of phrases and sentences or they come out while i talk just talk to myself pretending that everything really happens but then brought crashing down to earth what happens when i lose words? when they dont form anymore? when i just cant explain? i guess things will just build up build up to an explosion of new words and poems completing and restarting a cycle of emotions this maybe the end of such outbursts of emotions but i had fun and i hope you've finally glimsped the real me.

      do NOT ask me what "blogs pt 1" was supposed to be about... i was just looking at the memory thing that my computer has, and tells me every title i've ever used in a blog... that i've written at home anyway.  tomorrow is a yucky day. i will show you how yucky....  p 1+2 ~ english stuff due p 3+4 ~ computing test p 5 ~ history test p 6 ~ maths test p 7 ~ science stuff due p 8 ~ nothing, thankfully!  and that consitutes my whole day tomorrow... so you can imagine me cramming and stuff yeah? wrong. i'm blogging, talking to some people, procrastinating generally... but i've finished the english... and the maths i'm pretty cool with... it's just a matter of finishing science and studying somewhat for the history and computing, mainly computing, seeing as history is half open book anyway! =)  and because i can hear the voices of four dead ugly men, i think i better go and finish them off before they start to take over my dreams! eek!

      there i go again, sticking my nose into where it's not needed, opening my mouth when it's not wanted, trying to care when they don't want to be cared for. i mean, sometimes things come out all wrong and then they get all defensive, when you really didn't mean it like that. you just wanted to show them that you cared, but noooo, they have to turn around and bite back at you. hard. that's what you get in return for trying to help. so what's the point of trying to help? maybe for your own benefit? or maybe because you genuinely DO care for that person. is it your fault that you care? is is your fault that when you're asking them questions, you don't know the answers because they won't tell you and they don't want to tell you? are you supposed to defend yourself? or just let them dig into you? or just forget about it altogether? if only i knew what to do in this current situation of mine. and since when did i do something because everyone told me i should? coz i did. but maybe i did it because i wanted to. i'm too confused to think about this right now, too much going on. but i thought that they didn't have to be so defensive about it, could have just put it a little simpler, less "bang bang boom". but it didn't happen that way, so is it my fault that they got pissed? or is it their fault because they never told me in the first place. or should i just drop the whole thing and forget about it altogether. maybe that's the best thing.   but i can't forget. coz it hurts.

      for that second chance.  i have decided that, although she seems very blonde, i like hayley... only after barry though...! =)  ok. i am already WAY too obsessed with idol... need to focus on OTHER things... like piano. *sigh*    Robert Comier's advice to young writers:     Always keep a journal. write in it  your observations, your thoughts and feelings. it is a record of your experiences and responses to them at any one time. if they are not recorded, they may be lost for all time. get into the habit of writing regularly. when i am at home, i write each day.   Ok... well i do that sort of... this... and then the more personal crapy diary.. that is sort of depressing to read. yes.  tick!    write from your own experiences, your own feelings. it is my emotions that are played out in my books. no matter how much i shudder when i re-read my early stories, i see in them two elements that made publishers want them: simplicity and truth. i did not drive my readers to the dictionary and i wrote about on things i know.    ok... so i sometimes do that... especially about certain... people...   a most important phrase "what if?". in  the chocolate was  nothing really traumatic happened too my son, who refused to sell chocolaTes for his school. but what if? what if there was peer pressure? what if there was family pressure? answering these questions forces  you to create characters and events.   no. i never do that. i can't write about people refusing to sell chocolates. there are too many people who WANT to... =) but, that's a good one to keep in mind.   write with a sense of joy. if you don't enjoy what you're writing you need to start again.   yupz. take my stupid hermione/draco fanfic.... =) done done and done.   remember you are an entertainer, your purpose is to keep the readers turning those pages. i write so my books will be read. i want to affect my audience.   can you just write coz you feel like it? *sigh* i mean, wouldn't that be like writing for reviews... and only for that purpose? *Shrug*   don't expect to get it right the first time. i often think of myself as a re-writer. a writer does not have to get it right the first time.   yeah jay! =) um.... no. usually i'm just writing... and then i can't be bothered to re do the whole thing just so i'm satisfied. but if i was to make a living outta writing... then i probably would...    a writer need not be outgoing and popular but he can't expect to be a recluse either. a writer has to be more humane than other people. he has to move amongst people, eavesdrop on coversations if he is to affect people.   EAVESDROP?!?! yeah, done. but not more humane.... =/    wait a sec... why am i doing this? why am i wasting time? oh yeah, coz i don't want to do Challenge 4...   Write an outline of a training program to help computer users develop good ergonomic habits.   do i care?!?!?!? =/ *sigh*  anyway... i SHOULD do it though... so i will.

      so now my parents are watching it, coz they haven't seen it before. and it's sort of giving my little fantasies... not to be a  blonde ditz or anything... about going overseas to do law... harvard... *dreamy look in eyes*... ok. i'm snapping out of it. there's NO way that i'm gonna get that... *sigh*   but anyway, law. it would be... supposedly supposed to be boring yeah? i dunno... but now that i've convinced my parents that i don't have to do a science... i'm stuck with an empty 2 units.   "LIPOSUCTION!" ok... i don't want THAT part of LB... *sigh* but i think this movie grows on you... coz it's doing that right now...  *aahh* now the emmett bit would be nice! =) *sigh* he's so sweet. but then again, i wouldn't go to law school just coz i wanted to get my boyfriend back. *sigh* this is all getting a little weird...  and then i would probably never win a case because i would probably never know that a gay guy would know fashion... but yeah.... "don't stomp you're last-season Prada shoes at me honey."  and then i don't want the mentor feeling me up.  awwwwwwww... emmett is sooo sweet. ok. i'm REALLY turning into jay. but he's really sweet. "What if you're trying to be someone you are?" ... "stay."   "if i'm going to be the partner of a law firm by the age of 30, i need someone who isn't a complete bonehead."  hehehehe....   *sigh* i just need to be good at public speaking... sorta.... =/ *shrug*  i dunno. it's weird to be thinking about this stuff so early, but life sorta just whizzes by and sometimes you arrive at a point in your life, a point that you've never really thought about before, and then you're stuck when you don't really know what decision to make. so... i've been thinking a lot about year 11 and 12... thinking about how scary it seems. it used to seem so far away, but it's not really, is it?   then it makes you remember the old times, when you were little... and there were always people there... and they were there for you. you didn't have any complicated feelings... you always knew the right thing... you always knew exactly how you were feeling.  ok. getting off topic here...  and the walk suddenly becomes a lot rougher. when you're little, you just believe in everything. when you grow up a little, you try and really understand everything, but find that there isn't really all that much that you've got to understand to cement it, it's just a matter of whether or not you have the guts to do it. but it's the finer points that seem to really stand out... but never actually stick.   and then you get all sorts of weird emotions, love, hate, betrayal, jealousy, ignorance... and you just don't know what to do with them. hurt.   this is getting very touchy feely... it started off as a har-di-har about LB... and now it's turned into my life story... interesting how i can carry on like this WITHOUT writing incredibly horrible poetry! =)  forgiveness... and asking for it. it's hard. but what's more important? your pride, or your friends? i would always have said friends, but when the time came, i really did, and i've gotta say that i always thought that i would pick pride when the time really came. you can always say stuff, but when the time comes, you just never know what you're going to do...   so i'm sorry. i value you guys as friends. i would hate to lose you. no matter what i say, no matter how i act, just know that i count you as my friends. i can be a real cow some days... ok. all days, but i'm trying to change. realising that i could lose friends over my cow-iness, is making me REALLY try. i say it all the time... but the two sides of me a going to become one, hopefully, and i hope it IS a better me. you don't read this, but i'm just putting it here anyway... in case you do happen to pass by one day. =/  so when you watch movies, you should never write blog entries about them, because you will end up blabbing on about something that doesn't really relate to it at all.... =/  i'm up late again, but i think i will live another night with only a couple of hours sleep... =/ which is really bad for me... *yawn* zzzzzz......

      well, i should really forgive you right about now. i keep bringing it up... and i shouldn't. i'm pretty sure you feel bad enough about it already. so i'm going to drop it, and if i bring it up, whack me or something. i'm sorry for hounding you about it... just hope that they turn  up some time before year 12, yeah? *sigh*  on a less personal note, yg was good today. so maybe i didn't exactly pay much attention... =/ but it was nice to be back... feels like i haven't seen everyone for so long!!!! so it was good to be back! =)

I can write about anything and everything that happens to me - from the food I ate to what I was doing when I heard the latest 'breaking news'. Being able to communicate with my friends (online and/or real life) through my blog is important to me.     yeah... sounds about right.... =/

      My  urlLink Bloginality  is  urlLink INFJ !!!   As an INFJ, you are Intraverted, iNtuative, Feeling , and Judging. This makes your primary focus on Intraverted Intuation with Extraverted Feeling.  This is defined as a NF personality, which is part of Carl Jung's Idealist (Identity Seeking) type, and more specifically the Counselors or Protectors  As a weblogger, you are a perfectionist. Even though you have artistic thoughts, you may change designs frequently because of this perfectionistic insticts. You appreciate order and systems, and so you may stay with the same weblog program for a long time to keep things constant. Your personality type is rare, and so you are very special!    hummz... i dunno... maybe? do i change my blog layout frequently? i do for my site... but that was coz i got bored? dummdidumm... and yes about the "stay with the same weblog program", therefore my hatred of blogdrive =)  *sigh* i have succumbed to peer pressure...

ANYWAY, i caught the bus to oakhill, and waited. and waited. until my bus came. i ran my dad, to see where he was, but he didn't pick up. so i caught my bus home... only to get home to find that my dad had already gone, and that he was checking at towers... so then, he FINALLY came home... and then we went to get my glasses... and now i have them! so hopefully now i can see! =)   anyway... i'm getting really tired... and it's not even 11 yet... which is weird... maybe my late nights are catching up to me? =/
