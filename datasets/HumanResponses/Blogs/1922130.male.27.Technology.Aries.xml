      I watched Monty Python's Life of Brian on Saturday night.  (see Sept. 11th post #1)  Uh...it was typical Monty Python and had a few good laughs but doesn't even come close to Quest for the Holy Grail.  Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for their brand of comedy, but I can't give it a single thumbs up.  Note that I am NOT a huge fan of British humor but for whatever reason have a weakness for the Holy Grail film.  The camping trip I had been looking forward to didn't happen.  Bubba was slightly sick and didn't want to go, especially since it was supposed to rain (which it did).   Instead Josh, Bubba, and I had a celebration of red meat, beer, and football at my house.  It was a great day for grilling and we had a good time, it sure was good to hang out with those boys.  Bubba's wife changed jobs recently and now works for a beer distributor so she can get cases of beer on the cheap.  (Thanks for the brews Bubba.)  The red meat and beer were good but the football left a little bit of a sour taste in my mouth as Wake lost to UVa.  Wake was up by a field goal late in the 4th and decided to go for it on a 4th and 2 instead of kicking an easy field goal.  They ran an ugly run play off to the side, got stuffed, and forfeited 3 points.  (Sound familiar?  Read my post from Sept. 15th.)  They then proceeded to let UVa march down the field and kick a field goal to tie it.  A few plays later, Randolph throws an interception which leads to a winning field goal by Virginia as the clock winds down.  What kind of bush league play calling is that?  NEVER GO FOR IT ON 4TH AND 2 IF YOU ARE UP BY A FIELD GOAL AND IN FIELD GOAL RANGE.  By calling that play Grobe not only gave away an easy 3 points but took the air out of his defense by saying "Hey, we gotta go for it and get up by more than a TD because there is NO WAY my defense can keep Virginia out of the end zone for another 5 minutes of play."  What a crock.  I just finished reading Umberto Eco's "The Name of the Rose" last night.  It's a murder mystery set in a monastery in the 14th century.  There was quite a bit of Latin (I'd say about a tenth) scattered throughout the text.  I don't comprehend ANY Latin words unless they are cognates or are in Requiem and I remember them from my choral days, so you would think that  I would have zipped right through this one.  You would be wrong.  It took me forever because I read this book 5 pages at a time.  After 4 pages my eyelids would begin to flutter as I struggled with consciousness and by page 5 I would be asleep.  I don't know why, it was a thoroughly entertaining story, but something about the style of writing knocked me out.  I would still recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.  Of course,  I only understood 90% of what I read so don't listen to me.     Alison and I watched "Sidewalks of New York" on Friday.  Neither of us is quite sure whether or not it was worth our two hours.  There is some good comedy but I think it was supposed to offer some commentary on life and love and I just didn't get it.  I like Edward Burns' voice, Brittany Murphy and Heather Graham are fun to look at, and that guy David Krumholtz cracks me up so I will give it one thumb up.      I've been riding my bike around Salem Lake often in the evenings.  I like riding that trail a great deal but I had to go buy a new saddle for my bike because my penis started going numb.  What's that?  No, you heard me correctly,  my penis would go numb after about mile 5 of the 7 mile trail.  I'm sure I don't need to explain how bizarre and VERY VERY BAD that is.  The new saddle is wider and has solved the problem.  I have resumed sleeping at night.  My fantasy football team lost 2 more this weekend.  I am now 9th in my league of 12 at 2 and 6.  I think Willie Nelson said it best regarding my fantasy team:  "Started out with a dream and the plans of a wise man, but ended up with the heartaches of a fool..."   -- Heartaches of a Fool

      I watched "Bananas," a Woody Allen pic from 1971, last night.  It was highly entertaining as most but not all of Woody's films are.   I particularly like the discussion of yoga and eastern philosophy towards the beginning.  The dude who played the dad on Different Strokes was in it as was a very young Sylvester Stallone playing a bit part as a  thug.   Two thumbs up for good laughs and brevity.     urlLink What's your favorite TD celebration?  I gotta go with the dirty bird just because they got Dan Reeves to do it once.  Since my last post I have decided that mowing the yard officially sucks.   I have also decided that I make excellent beer.  The most recent batch I made and bottled is a porter and I've been happy to discover that the longer it's in the bottle, the better it gets.   It is kind of heavy, though.  I think I'm going to make and amber next time.  Fantasy team won one and tied one but lost the tie breaker (bench scoring) so now I'm 2 - 4.

      No, literally, I'm sick and tired.  I'm having one of my semiannual bouts of allergy related funk and have surpassed both of my dogs as the most prolific mucus producer in my household.   Uggghhh.  I went to the Wake/ECU football game Saturday.  Did a little tailgating and what not.  Wake whooped up on ECU, the weather was great (it was an evening game), and I predicted a fake field goal attempt that ECU ran in for a TD....good times.    (Note to self, pump your contacts for free tickets to the other home games later this season.  After all, it's not really a good tailgate unless you freeze your kiester off.)  Ali joined Netflix last week, so we had some movies to watch this weekend:  Sum of All Fears  -  Another Clancy installment, Jack Ryan saves the world as the US is duped into believing that the Russians have started a nuclear war with the U.S.  One thumb up for the nuclear explosion in Baltimore.   One thumb down because B. Af. sucks as Jack Ryan and Morgan Freeman plays the same role he plays in every movie.    The Count of Monte Cristo  - Guy Pearce (no releation) and James Caviezel star in a stellar rendition of a classic story.  I was thorougly impressed...Pearce is a good bad guy, James Caviezel's usually annoying dryness worked out for him in his role as the count.   One hottie and sufficient comic relief:  two thumbs up.  Spy Game  - The damn disc was cracked and wouldn't play in my DVD player.  I'm not sure this Netflix thing is gonna work out.    No review  I've got a camping trip planned with Josh and Bubba this coming weekend.  Should be a hoot.    Fantasy football this week:  both of my games are still up in the air going into MNF.  More tomorrow....

      Hurricane Isabel will slap the NC coast today.  I hate the potential for loss of life but I love when mother nature decides to remind us how small we are.   The storm is supposedly weakening already but the downside is that it's huge and is supposed to make landfall right around Morehead City, Beaufort, and Atlantic Beach.  One of my favorite fishing destinations, Harkers Island, is right up the road from there...I hope the  Pasfield's stay high and dry down at the Harkers Island Fishing Center.  Somebody better be looking after that crazy guy who builds model boats in the house next to the marina as well. We'll probably get nothing but a bunch of rain and moderate wind out of the whole thing here in Winston Salem.    Last night I helped a friend move the timbers from an old fallen-in kitchen behind his "new" turn of the century house.  He had to get the rubble cleaned up becuase his insurance company was threatening to cancel his homeowners insurance policy if he didn't.  Some of those timbers must have weighed 400 pounds, my friend fell while carrying one of them and messed his knee up.  When it happened I was afraid he broke his leg and the bone was gonna be all sticking out of the skin or something.  My reward for helping was beer and mexican food after it got too dark to continue.   Good times.  My name will be in the Wall Street Journal today.  Apparently the Babcock school takes out an ad and prints a graduation announcement for my class.  Cool, huh.

      Ok,  fresh off a busy weekend.    First off, Friday night Ali and I went to my graduation ceremony.  For those of you who don't know, I just finished the evening MBA program at Wake Forest University.  It was at a fancy shmancy country club near the campus and was the best graduation ceremony I've ever been to for four reasons:  1.  Open Bar 2.  Free dinner 3.  No gowns or tassels 4.  Low sappy go forth and prosper content 5.  It was for me!  That was five reasons, but I'm not in school anymore so I don't care.  A bunch of my fellow graduates and I went out to the Dback grill afterwards to continue the celebration....and then to another place after that (don't know the name).   It got a little ugly, one of the drunken graduates requested "Holiday" about 50 times from the bartender/DJ and proceeded to dance on a pool table, hump a pool table, and attempt to hump other drunken graduates until he was kneed in the groin by yours truly.  I think he paid for my beer in the end so I guess he's not holding any grudges.   Overall it was a great night and I hope I am able to keep in touch with my former classmates.    Saturday:  Wake Forest vs. Purdue football game I've been helping out this dude at work (for those of you who don't know, I also work at Wake Forest University) who works in the athletics department with some network problems he's been having.  He hooked me up with some free tickets to the football game, so Ali and I went to that.  It was hot as blazes in the stands, we both got sunburned, and the Deacs played poorly.  After picking up a bowl victory last post season, beating BC at BC and then knocking off the #11 ranked Wolfpack to become the 20th ranked team in the nation, I thought Coach Grobe was money.    The play calling against Purdue changed my opinion.   The run game wasn't working at all, so to fix the problem they ran the ball some more...even though Wake has proven it can be dangerous through the air.  The most egregious error had to be a late 4th quarter 4th and 1 in the red zone.....you guessed it - a run play -  I think it was supposed to be an end around but never quite got around.  It cost them the possession and any shot at the game.    There was a graduation party at one of my classmates house in Greensboro Saturday night.  It was a nice party...chillin on the deck drinking keg beer and wine and eating all manner of good food.  It was very laid back and we had a great time.    Sunday we went to Carrboro to have dinner with Ali's folks.  It was a birthday celebration as Ali's sister Susie, a sophomore at UNC Chapel Hill, turned 19 recently.   We went to a nice Italian place on Franklin St. in Chapel Hill called 411, I highly recommend it.   Oh, and my fantasy football team won one and lost one taking my team to 1 - 3 so far this year.  Ouch.

      The MAN IN BLACK died today.  That sucks.  I have loved Johnny Cash's music for some time and I have more recently become a big fan of the Carter family as well.  I firmly believe that Johnny and June are singing "Jackson" together somewhere right now to a stunned audience.  Today's list is my top five J.R. Cash songs: 1.  Sunday Morning Coming Down - "the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad so I had one more fore dessert" 2.  I Walk The Line 3.  Jackson 4.  Folsom Prison Blues 5.  Big River  Also receiving votes:  Ring of Fire, Understand Your Man, and Ballad of Ira Hayes    I will wear black today and play every Johnny Cash song I know how to play on the guitar.  I will then learn some that I don't know.

      So I'm watching the second Lord of the Rings movie and I'm thinking Elron sure was a good villlian in The Matrix.    I think I'll start out my journal with a list:  top 5 movie villians.  1.  Leonard Smalls - Randall "Tex" Cobb - Raising Arizona 2.  Liquid Metal Man (aka T-1000) - Robert Patrick - Terminator 2 3.  Agent Smith - Hugo  Weaving - The Matrix 4.  Commodus - Joaquin Phoenix - Gladiator 5.  Mama Fratelli - Anne Ramsey - The Goonies  Admittedly this list is weak with only a trio of true badasses, but they popped into my brain at the moment. (credit #4 to Big Al)     I'm polishing off a bottle of bourbon that a good friend of mine and I started this past weekend (mmmm.... bourbon)  My weekend starts tomorrow because I'm taking Friday off.  wooohooo!    Big Al had jury duty today.....boring!  She just had to sit in a room and read the book she brought for 4 and a half hours.  I hope I never get jury duty, though I do like to read.  Keeping on the sunny side, we did get to have lunch together today...a rare occasion for us on a weekday.  RANT - Based on a conversation between my boss and a coworker yesterday:  What the hell is it with the letter q and and the letter u?  They're always together.  U can exist without Q but Q can't exist in a word without a following U (not counting proper nouns and acronyms).  Hell, Scrabble strategists will tell you to hold a U until the end of the game just so you can use it in case you get stuck with a Q.   I can solve this problem:  I think, since Q can't be used in a word without being followed by a U, that the U should just be implied and not be included.  Thus, quest would be spelled qest, quality would be spelled qality, and Larroquette would be spelled Larroqette (go Night Court, no wait...Larroquette is a proper noun, can't use that one.  How about equestrian would be spelled eqestrian).  just read the above...no more bourbon or weblogging for me tonight

      Ok, I'm starting a weblog.  We'll see how this goes.   I've never actually seen Monty Python's "The Life of Brian" but I'm stealing the title anyway.  I vow to watch it soon.  I know it's about religion, which means it's probably very offensive to some people and very funny to everyone else.

      I'm back. The past couple of weeks have been eventful or I would have posted something sooner.   For starters, two of my good buddies from Nashville, TN were in the area to play a couple of shows.  Matt and Phillip want to be professional singer songwriters when they grow up.  I had my doubts about them making it in this line of work when they moved to Nashville to give it a go four years ago, but after hearing their recent work, I've changed my mind.  They pretty much kick ass now.  They can play circles around me on the guitar now and their songwriting has improved 100 times over.  They played a coffeeshop in Greensboro (The Green Bean) on Friday the 17th to a relatively packed house and then  played a benefit concert on Thursday the 23rd.  The benefit show was for a scholarship fund set up in honor of my old high school glee club director, Duane Best, so it was for an excellent cause.  The guys even let yours truly join them on stage for a couple of numbers  (though I didn't get to practice with them much ahead of time).   The venue was the theater at Rockingham Community College, it's a really nice place to hear live acoustic music.  They have nice equipment and acoustics are excellent. I enjoyed playing and singing in front of people again and really enjoyed the other guys sets.    On Saturday the 18th I was supposed to participate in a glee club reunion concert at my high school.  The concert was the latter part of a ceremony dedicating the auditorium at the high school to Duane Best.  It's now the R. Duane Best Auditorium or something like that.  They also took donations for the previously mentioned scholarship fund.  I didn't get to the rehearsals in time to participate on Saturday, so I just volunteered as a stage hand.  It was a good thing too because there was a fair amount to do behind the scenes.  It was a nice ceremony and the chorus sounded good considering there were only 3 rehearsals.  I'm glad Mr. B is getting some props in retirement.  I also went to the Apple Festival in Eden for the first time on the 18th.  Lots of mullets, lots of deep fat fried sugary things, lots of cheesy country music, nuff said.  This past Friday (the 24th) I went up to Pilot Mtn. to go to open mic at a coffeeshop that specializes in live acoustic music.  It was a pretty cool place, but it was empty.  The biggest group of people there was the group that I was with:  Matt Phillip, Kim (Phillips GF), Ali, and me.  I'd say there were 15 - 18 people there total.  The place is apparently very bluegrass oriented, which I really dig, but I'm not sure Matt and Phillip were too hot on it.  They played a long set of their "country" stuff, so they didn't stick out too bad.  I think they were well received even though they didn't do any bluegrass.  I may even go up there sometime and try to get in on a little bluegrass picking sometime.    Saturday the 25th I got up early and drove over to Elizabethton Tennessee to go trout fishing with my coworker, Bill, on the Watauga river and the Southern branch of the Holston river.  It was a gorgeous drive, the leaves are looking good this time of year and I got to see the sunrise in Boone for the first time in several years.  I got to Bill's about 9 am and we headed out to this little campground right on the Watauga where you can park for $5 to fish.  We fished from about 10 until 1:30  and when we came back, Bill's pickup wasn't where we left it.  We figured somebody at the campground screwed up and didn't get our 5 bucks and consequently had us towed by mistake.  So we found the owner of the campground and asked him if he'd had anybody towed that day.  He shook his head and told us he hadn't even checked the lockbox with the money yet that day.  Turns out Bills truck was stolen.  We were dumbfounded.  We called the sheriff's department and reported the truck stolen and had Bill's wife come pick us up in her car.   That'll ruin a weekend of fishing like nothing else.  At least I caught a couple that morning, a small rainbow on a blue wing olive and another small bow on a pheasant tail nymph.  My boots (which I'd had since college), my new gore-tex raincoat, and my rod and reel cases were gone along with a few other things in the truck.  Bill lost his expensive sunglasses and his wallet, so he had to cancel his credit cards and everything.  I'd like to get my hands on the guys who did it for about a half hour.  The really crappy thing was I had left my keys in Bills truck and had no way to get into my truck that I left at Bill's place.  Of course, all the locksmiths I called could get me into the truck but none of them could make me a key for it until Monday morning, so Alison wound up driving up to Elizabethton on Sunday just to let me into the truck.  Bill and I did fish a little more on Sunday morning on the Holston, but I got skunked and he only caught one.  It's a little more challenging river to fish than the Watauga.   Ali and I stopped in Boone to walk around and eat dinner on the way home, which was cool.  We haven't spent much time there since college.  I really miss that place.

      Ok, I've decided there has been too much sports talk in the journal.  So no more for a while.     Ali and I have been trying to sell our house, it's a small starter home and we're ready for something bigger and nicer.  We've had it on the market for about 5 weeks with NO activity.  Saturday at 10:45am I got a call from a realtor who works at the same company as my agent .  She wanted to show the house that day at 11:30am.  Since we've heard nothing since we put the house on the market I wasn't about to say, "no way, we can't do it on that short a notice," so we scrambled like crazy to make the house presentable and clear out by 11:30.  Turns out the lady who looked at it really likes it and we may get an offer in the next couple of days.  I'll log the house selling process in the journal.  Yesterday Ali and I celebrated Columbus Day (not really, we both just had a day off) by going up to the Blue Ridge Parkway in Virginia.  We loaded the dogs up in the back of the truck and headed out for Rocky Knob and Mabry Mill.   I used to go to that area all the time growing up because it was the closest parkway access to my hometown but I haven't been there in roughly a decade.  It was a nice day and the foliage along the parkway was in full color.  It seems like I've seen it a thousand times but the fall colors still impress me every time.  We went to Rocky Knob first and hiked up to the Knob itself.  It was a little hairy with our two 90 pound dogs, there were a couple of times I thought dog and/or human was going to go tumbling down the cliff, but we managed to make it up and back in one piece.   Next we had a picnic lunch at the park and traveled down to Mabry Mill.  It's an old sawmill/gristmill that is now a historical sight.  Supposedly it is the most photographed location on the Blue Ridge Parkway, so I did my part to keep it that way by snapping a few photos as we made our way around the open air museum.  I'll see how the photos come out (I took an old SLR instead of my digital) and maybe post them.  We did some early Christmas shopping in the gift shop there (I've never ever done Christmas shopping before the week of Christmas) and then headed towards home.   Along the way, we stopped at Groundhog Mountain which may very well be the most boring "scenic overlook" on the parkway.  Basically it is a minifort/firetower (that looks like a kid's backyard clubhouse) and a bathroom .  It did have this display of the three types of rail fences (split, snake, and buck) which was kind of cool, but there was nothing scenic about it and there wasn't an overlook.  We also stopped at Pilot Mtn. State Park on the way home and snapped a few photos of the mountain.  It'a cylindrical rock formation on top of a low mountain that is visible from Virginia to Winston Salem on a clear day.  I live 25 minutes from this park but I'd never been to it before.  I think we're gonna go back and hike the trails there sometime, it looked pretty cool.  I think I got some really good pictures.  My grandmother from Texas is visiting my parents in Hickory so we went up to Hickory to visit on Thursday night and most of the day on Sunday.  Hickory is a cool place.  It's big enough to have stuff to do but it's still kind of redneck and there's a lot of open country nearby.  I like it enough to live there (if given the opportunity) but I'm not sure I want to live THAT close to my folks.  Anyway, it's always good to see Grandma, she's pretty cool to hang out with.    Diet:  I'm down 10 lbs.  I want beer and pizza but I can't have it.  Nuff said.

      I was watching Tim Wakefield pitch the the Red Sox/Yankees game last night and the telecasters kept showing his knuckleballs in slomo.   It was like watching a  moth try to fly in a straight line during a hurricane.....I have new respect for batters who can hit the knuckleball.  Fortunately the Sox won, but I didn't stay awake for the end of the game.  The Cubs beat the Marlins last night to the tune of 12-3 shellacking.  It's funny, I rarely watch baseball during the regular season, I'll check out a few innings here and there and check the scores and standings online from time to time, but when October rolls around I love to watch (or at least fall asleep to) the postseason series.  Last night during the game the announcers mentioned an online poll that asked if dynasties were good for baseball.  The result (not surprisingly, since a ton of Yankee fans were watching the game) was that dynasties are good for baseball.  Generally, I disagree. I like to see new teams in the post season each year, except for the Braves who should make the playoffs every season.  Oh, and the Braves pitching dynasty of the mid to late ninties was a great dynasty for baseball.    On the football half of life, the fantasy team went 2-0 this weekend (I told you I had good matchups this week) for the first time.   So now I'm 4 and 6 with a bullet.    The diet I'm on is working as expected, I'm dropping water and am down about 7 pounds in like 3 days.  Alison is a loser because she is no longer on the diet with me.  She says she still is, but she's eating cereal and PB&Js ....not on the plan.  So poo poo on her.  We watched "A Mighty Wind" Monday night.  Christopher Guest delivers another solid, witty performance both on screen and off, though I don't think it quite compares to "Best in Show."  Don't laugh but I think I'm gonna try to buy the soundtrack to the movie.  A lot of the folk music is hokie, yet somehow it mesmerizes me.  And almost all the music was performed AND written by the actors, which is definitely unique.  Two thumbs up for the film.

      I am. Today is devoted to watching football.  I could do something more productive with my day, but I have a couple of good fantasy matchups this week and the games on TV should be good ones, so why not? Plus, I rode the Salem Lake trail and the Salem Creek Greenway on my bike (a total of 16.3 miles) yesterday so I don't feel compelled to get out and exercise even though it is a beautiful day.  Last night Ali and I went over to Tommy's for dinner.  Phil and his fam were there.  We had a good time.  Tommy makes a killer queso and above average burgers.   Afterwards, Ali and I came home and watched "In The Bedroom."  It was easily the most depressing movie I've ever watched.  One thumb up for good acting, though.  Other moves I've seen since my last post include "Josie and the Pussycats" (Friday evening) and "Spy Game" (Thursday Evening).  Josie was stupid but mildlly entertaining in part due to an attractive cast.  Spy Game was excellent, two thumbs up for a great plot and Brad Pitt's mullet.  Wednesday night Ali and I went to Carrboro to drop my truck off with her parents.  They need to borrow it to move some furniture.  They're cool, it was nice to see them.    Ali and I are starting a diet tomorrow.  I think we're gonna try the South Beach Diet.  Before you get all judgmental and say that those gimmick diets never work, you should know that it was devised by a cardiologist and a nutritionist  and is basically a modified atkins low carb type diet.  You can eat carbs but only fiber rich nonprocessed carbs.  The only other diet I've ever tried was called the protein diet and was essentially a less restrictive atkins diet.  It worked well, I lost 40 lbs., but it was not something that I could do indefinitely and, when I came off it, I predictably gained the 40 lbs. back.  Currently I am a rotund 6'1" 260 lbs and, unlike in my college days, there ain't much muscle accounting for all that weight. I'll keep track of our progress in the journal.

      it's been almost a month since I posted last.   I have a reasonable excuse...I've been in Europe for two weeks.   So here's how it breaks down:  nothing worth noting happened between the 27th of October and the 5th of November.  On the latter date, I departed with three of my coworkers from Raleigh/Durham headed to Marco Polo airport in Venice, Italy via JFK in New York.  The purpose of our trip was to upgrade the wireless networks and perform computer support functions at three overseas houses owned by Wake.  The four of us went to Venice, then we split up two and two to go to Vienna, Austria and London, UK.  I am currently writing from London.  The work in Venice wasn't scheduled to commence until Monday, the 10th, so we had some free time built in up front to get acclimated and sight see.  Alison decided at the last second to join me in Venice those first few days.  It turned out alright in the end but it was a major fiasco in execution.  To begin with, Ali hadn't updated her passport since we got married, so it was still issued in her maiden name.  The airlines originally told us that this wasn't a problem so long as she was able to produce a copy of our marriage license, however, when we got to Ralieigh, the intermediate carrier (United)  said that she wouldn't be allowed to board because of the passport discrepancy.  The international carrier, Al Italia, still said that the passport + marriage license would do.  A few tears and several phone calls later, I had the United checkin supervisor walk up and tell us that he'd been instructed to board Ali....yay for the Expedia's customer service.  So on we go through security.  Ali is flying through Dulles, Va. and then on to JFK and then we are supposed to be on the same international flight to Venice (My coworkers and I flew straight to JFK).  Ali's plane boards and I assume she has left the ground 30 minutes later when my flight boards.  I get to NYC to find out that Ali's flight never left the ground due to closings in Dulles relating to weather (there were thunderstorms in the area).  So she is going to miss the international flight because she can't get out of Raleigh.  Ultimately she winds up taking the exact same itenerary she had planned except that it is one day behind schedule.  The combination of several flight changes and my cell phone not working upon arrival in Venice led me to believe that she would be in on Friday afternoon when she actually arrived on Friday morning so I wasn't there to meet her at the airport.  She found her way though and was waiting in the lobby of the hotel as I was leaving to meet her at the airport.  What a mess!  Venice is a beautiful place.  I love being on the water so I was pleased as we got out of an airplane and into a boat - a water taxi - to go to the hotel.  Cars and buses can go to Venice via a single land bridge to the islands but most traffic comes and goes by boat.   Travelling by car is not possible in 90% of the city so you have to walk, take a water taxi, or take a water bus (vaporetto) to get about.    In Venice we went sight seeing the first couple of days (Thursday and Friday).  We visited St. Mark's Square, toured the church and rode up to the top of the bell tower.  We walked over to the shops along the Rialto, one of only three bridges spanning the Grand Canal.  On Saturday we visited the island of Murano, known for it's blown glass.  We got a free water taxi to the island and then a tour of the glass blowing facility followed by hard sell tactics in the factory's gallery.  It rained heavily all day and I got a little tired of following the women in our group into each every one of the hundred or so glass shops on the island.   Sunday Ali and I mostly shopped for souvenirs but we also visited the Gallery Accademia - an art museum filled with the works of the 16th and 17th century Venetian masters.  I am no art buff but the sheer size of some of the paintings was breathtaking.     Each night we were there we ate like kings, there are plenty of sandwich shops and the like to have a quick lunch in but at night you are restricted to nicer restaurants, everything else is closed.  Seafood and pasta dominated the menus and most places had an extensive selection of pizzas.  The wines of Italy are wonderful, we sampled Valpolicellas, Bordolinos, Chiantis, and Merlots.  I was also told of a dessert wine call fragolina which I sought out and sampled as well.  I have a bag full of bottles to stock the winerack at home.    Monday we started working at Casa ArTom, the house owned by WFU.  It is situated at the mouth of the Grand Canal, the waters of the canal lap at it's walls.  It is a beautiful facility and is right next door to the Guggenheim musem of modern art which houses several of Dali's works.   The work went relatively smoothly although we didn't have some of the equipment we were to install until the day before we left.  The house employs a part time computer and network support person, Marco Di Menna, who acted as our translator and was an invaluable assistant in deploying the new wireless network.  We took Marco and his wife Mara to dinner on two occasions and were invited to his home on the night before we departed for an exquisite home cooked meal prepared by Mara.  I have never eaten so much in my life.  Her gnocchi was a religious experience.  Marco showed me the coolest wine tool ever conceived - it forces CO2 through a needle inserted through the cork and the internal pressure builds unti the cork is forced out.  I must have one.  Marco lives on the mainland in Mestre so we had to catch ar ride with him to and from his house.  On the way over we stopped at an Auchan - it's kind of like a much nicer Super Wal-Mart set up in mall style:  smaller individual stores within a larger store.  I picked up some of the wine to bring home there.  The next morning we took another water taxi to the airport.  Venice is no doubt best entered and departed by water.  I will update more on the London Leg of my trip at a later date.

      Bottom line is neither is happening.    Our  urlLink house  has shown about a half a dozen times since New Years.  We've had no offers.  We have moved a bunch of our crap over to my friend Marty's basement in an effort to make the house look bigger.  House selling has officially become no fun.  I'm still somewhat torn between trying to move soon to take advantage of favorable interest rates and staying put and socking money away.   I guess if we sell the house, we'll move and if we don't, we won't.    I have been half dieting for about 3 months now.  Not surprisingly I have lost no weight.  I started out on the South Beach Diet and decided it was way too hard and switched to a more Atkinsesque low card high fat type of thing and decided that was too hard and switched to my half diet.  I have the willpower of a  urlLink ficus .

      Well, it's now Friday the 20th and since nothing of any interest at all (besides  urlLink Wake  beating  urlLink Duke  on the 18th) has happened during the work week I'll just record what last weekend was all about.     urlLink Friday the 13th  I went to see  urlLink Orrin Star  play at the  urlLink Morning Dew coffeehouse  on Burke St. in Winston.  Orrin is a flatpick guitarist and mandolin player and mainly plays bluegrass and folk tunes.  Big Al went with me.  I don't think she was too impressed, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  The show was sponsored by the  urlLink Fiddle and Bow Society , which I aim to join the next chance I get, but the turnout was not so hot.  I think there were 16 people there including the guy making coffee.  So it was intimate and that was cool, but I think Orrin was dissappointed.  It's not good when the featured act is noticeably dissappointed about the turnout.  Maybe I read him wrong.  Orrin played the guitar for most of the show and was joined onstage by Jeff Foxall on the mandolin on most of the numbers.  Jeff is a local guy who plays with an unnamed bluegrass outfit at the  urlLink Dixie Classic Fair  and teaches guitar and mandolin out of the  urlLink Music Barn  in Greensboro.   I talked to him a little after the show about taking some lessons but I haven't called him yet.  Best music part of the evening:  Jeff and Orrin wore out a rendition of  urlLink Red Haired Boy , one of my favorite fiddle tunes.  Best non music part of the evening:  Orrin did a little storytelling between songs, one of which was about a lady he knew who lived in a tiny town in  urlLink Alaska  where the male to female ratio is something like 3 to 1.  Orrin asked her about the obvious opportunities she must have given the gender ratio to which she replied "Well, the odds are good, but the goods are odd."    Saturday, Valentines Day, Ali and I hung out for a while in the morning.  I finished up reading Dan Brown's " urlLink Angels and Demons " and then we went out to lunch at a pretty cool restaurant out towards  urlLink Clemmons  called Cities.  After that we went to  urlLink B&N  to spend a gift certificate Ali's grandparents gave us for Christmas.  The gift card was for $50 and we spent $130.  Ouch.   We should be in books for a few months now.  That night we watched Gangs of New York, on of our  urlLink Netflix  selections.  Well, I say we watched.  I fell asleep with about an hour to go and Ali turned it off soon thereafter.  Needless to say we didn't care for it much and never watched the last hour.    Sunday, Ali went to Carrboro to go to the  urlLink UNC  vs.  urlLink Maryland  game with her sister.  I went to the  urlLink Wake  vs.  urlLink Cincinnati  game with my buddy Marty (after a little pre game warmup over at Cobalt's).  Both UNC and Wake won and then later that evening Duke lost to NC State capping off the perfect Sunday of college basketball.  AND  urlLink Dale Jr.  won the  urlLink Daytona 500 .  During this sporting frenzy it started snowing and by nightfall we had a couple of inches on the ground and roads.  WFU did me the favor of calling a 4 hour work delay for Monday morning so Marty and I stayed up super late playing guitar and drinking.  Today it's about 65 outside and everybody's thinking spring.

      How lame is this.  I take nearly a 3 month hiatus from this blog and come back with a title like "my weekend?"   It sounds like the title of something a first grader would turn in as a spelling exercise.  Well, you get what you pay for.  Seriously, I'm going to add some posts between my last one and this one to complete the Europe trip report and sum up what's been happenin with the man.  But for now you get what I did this weekend because it's fresh.  I took a half day off at work on Friday so big Al and I could get a jumpstart on a road trip up to Radford, VA to visit Ali's college roommate and good friend Michelle.  You could write a book about Michelle (and some pshychologist might someday) so I will say nothing more than Michelle is a unique individual.   I went home with every intention of eating lunch, packing, and walking the dogs before Ali got home so we could leave as soon as she got ready.  (Why the rush you ask?  Wine tasting starts at 5:30 I reply)  I wound up getting sucked into this show on the  urlLink National Geographic  channel about these guys whose plane crashed at 11,000 feet on Mount McKinley (my people call it  urlLink Denali ) and were stuck for several days in a blizzard.  Two of the four perished and the others lost toes, fingers, legs, and the like to frostbite before they were rescued by a rag tag group of "mountain men" who where frustrated with the Army and Park Service failed attempts to rescue the ill equipped crash victims.  Ultimately, one of the survivors sued the Army and Park Service for the botched rescue and won $50K a year for life.  The other guy became an alcoholic, sobered up, got prosthetic legs and took up.......mountain climbing.  He revisited the site of the crash on a climb before eventually dying in a climbing accident.  Crazy world we live in.  Someone ought to sell tickets.  Anyway, I did pack and walk the  urlLink dogs  (in the only downpour we've had in months....funny how that works) and Ali got home and off we went.  We took my  urlLink truck  because of the risk of inclement weather (it's 4WD) and so I had to fill it up with gas.  This is not normally something I would record for posterity but it reminds me of possibly my biggest pet peeve of all time:  gas stations that put a cap on the amount of gas you can pump at one time.  You see, my truck has a 34 gallon tank so a gas station who caps the amount of gas you can pump at $35 or even $50 (34 * $1.599 = $54.366) keeps me from completely filling my tank.  This means I have to stop more often to fill up.   I don't live in  urlLink NJ  so I have to actually get out of my truck and stand in the cold to complete this task.  You can see where I'm going with this.  What gives?  Are they concerned about drive aways?  Is this something that the attendant has control over?  Do I look suspicious?  I am boycotting gas stations who do this.  The only two I know of are the  urlLink BP  on Linville Rd. and a  urlLink Citgo  on Silas Creek Parkway near  urlLink Forsyth Tech .    We made it up to  urlLink Radford  in a couple of hours.  It rained the whole way but it is still a pretty drive.  Michelle and her dog, Bear, gave us a warm welcome, and off we headed to dinner.  We ate at Spinnakers, the hotel restaurant at Best Western, Radford, where Michelle's fiance Jason works.  The only interesting thing to note is that we met Jason (who was working) and found out that  urlLink General Wesley Clark  was scheduled to speak at the adjacent ballroom later that night.   Weird place to solicit Democratic votes, but I guess that's what potential politicians do.    We were were extremely late to the wine tasting.  It was at a little gift shop on the main drag in Radford, I couldn't tell you the name of the shop or the street but I do recall that the featured chateau was  urlLink Rockbridge .  Mighty tasty - it's all blended stuff but Alison liked their blanc and I enjoyed their Tuscarora Red.  We also found out that the wine tasting was indeed a wine/chocolate tasting.  We neglected to have any chocolate because wine and chocolate didn't seem like a good combination at the time.  They were selling wine by the glass after you had sampled the wares and an appropriate amount of imbibing ensued.  Michelle knew everybody at this place, which I believe is mostly attributable to the fact that Michelle generally seems to know a lot of people and that she works across the street from the wine tasting shop at a coffee shop that is apparently popular with the wine tasting crowd.  This coffee shop, which goes by the The Coffee Milll, was our next destination.   Dot dot dash was playing at The Coffee Mill.  They are an old-time/appalachian acoustic trio consisting of guitar, mandolin, and fiddle.  An acquantance of ours from college is married to the mandolin player and the fiddle player used to teach geology at  urlLink ASU  where Michelle met him.  He now teaches at  urlLink Radford  and the Radford academic crowd was out to hear their colleague.  This night they were also featuring the wife of the fiddle player on the oboe.  That's right, the oboe.  Overall, the music was well played and enjoyable, but this has to be the dorkiest band on the planet.  Imagine a bunch of college science professor types rockin out on traditional tunes and trying to look cool  They had no stage presence and for the most part kept their noses buried in their music stands while playing, but I'd go see them again for no other reason than they were having fun.   The Coffee Mill is pretty cool, I am going to recommend it to my friends playing the coffee shop circuit as a potential venue.    Upon leaving the place we participated in a hit and run accident in the downtown parking lot where we had parked (needless to say, Michelle was at the wheel) and made a quick beer run before retiring to Michelle's insanely smokey apartment.  Jason came home after work with surprisingly little news of the General Wesley Clark Experience and we all vegged for a while and alternately listened to Jason's self made cd (very  urlLink pink floyd )  and watched the first  urlLink LOTR  flick.    Saturday we came back and watched  urlLink UNC   urlLink beat   urlLink Wake Forest  (I never know who to pull for) and then watched  urlLink Bridget Jones's Diary  with Renee Zellweger and Windtalkers with Nicholas Cage.  Neither did all that much for me but Diary was entertaining enough (big Al tells me the book is excellent) while  urlLink Windtalkers  was quite bad.  The true events are more interesting than the movie.  (It's about the code the Army used in WWII that was based on the  urlLink Navajo  language - they used Native Americans as communcations officers)  Sunday found me deciding to learn to play the harmonica as well as practicing  urlLink mandolin  and  urlLink guitar .

      I have one.    I guess  urlLink Matt Thackston  kicked the whole thing off.  Big Al and I ventured to  urlLink Carrboro  on 1/10/04 to see Matt wow a coffeeshop full of hippies and friends at the  urlLink Open Eye Cafe .  He did a couple of well chosen covers and put on a good show.  Much to his dismay, the  urlLink Titans  lost to  urlLink Indy  in the playoffs that same night.     Next, Tommy, Jackie, Marty, Big Al and I decided to go see a couple of country bands on 1/16/04.  We took in  urlLink The Rounders  and  urlLink Cash Monies and the Jetsetter  at  urlLink The Garage .  The Rounders are from somewhere in eastern Tennessee and were awesome.  They kind of have a rockabilly thing going and they look like something straight out of  urlLink Deliverance .  Great stage presence and good chops.  We bought a CD and had it autographed.  My favorite thing about the liner notes is that the bass players list of contributions includes "dog house bass" and "yells."  He was a true showman.  Check those guys out if you get the chance.  Cash Monies and company were from Boston and you could tell.  Country bands should not be from Boston.  I think they were actually embarrassed to have to follow an act like The Rounders.  They were okay, don't get me wrong, but they didn't stack up compared to their opening band.    We left early.  It was my first time at The Garage.  I'd heard lots of good things about the place and it seemed like a cool venue, but it was empty.  The guy who runs the place, Richard, said that it was because the bands were from out of town.  I'm not so sure.  I'll definitely add it to my list of happenin places in urlLink  W-S .  Finally Ali and I went to see  urlLink The Blue Dogs  at  urlLink Rubber Soul  on 1/24/04.  The Blue Dogs are now my favorite band ever.  Seriously.  They were great.  If I am ever fortunate to start another band (don't ask.....high school) I will model my band after the Blue Dogs.  They do bluegrass.  They do americana.   They do funk.  They do country and a whole lot more.  AND they make you laugh while they're at it.  AND all their songs sound more authentic than anything I've heard in a long time....even their covers.....nuff said.

      2/29/04 (Leap Day) - Visited Celeste, Rico, and Jayden in Thomasville with Alison.  Took them the old hand me down grill with a ruined burner tube that has been occupying space on our patio for months.  Also watched UNC barely beat NC State in Raleigh and Duke hold off FSU in Tallahassee.   2/28/04 - Went shopping at the Salvage Discount Store near our house.  This place is a truly bizarre collection of random crap.  We love it.   Also called Ron, Matt, Bubba, and Josh that night.  Ali and I watched "Chocolat" that night.  I fell asleep about halfway through but enjoyed the parts I saw.   2/27/ 04 - Free day off!!!  We had about 5 inches of snow overnight Thursday so Wake and UNCG were closed due to inclement weather.  Ali and I watched "Tears of the Sun" that morning.  Then we went out and made a giant snowman in our back yards.  Our snowman had a few dog turds embedded in him but he didn't seem to mind.  I'll have pictures soon. We took Rachel and Robert  (neighbors) out for dinner at Ronni's.  Made mental note to get medium wings next time instead of hot.    Went to see "The Passion of the Christ" after dinner. Very accurate portrayal of what I'd been taught growing up in chruch.  Unneccesarily gory in my opinion and not making the most of great plot potential.    2/26/04 - Watched "Dreamcatcher" with Alison.  Great book.  Scary movie.    2/25/04 - Went the the Wake/FSU game to see Wake come from way behind to beat FSU in overtime.  Wake didn't deserve to win but they pulled it out somehow.   2/21/04 -  Went to see Peter May and the Rough Band at Rubber Soul with Ali.  They were an ok blues band.  I don't think we'll see them again.    That's all I can remember.

      writer.   Or I would post more than roughly twice a year.  I guess the good thing about my delinquency is that I will have a lot to say when I do actually post.    I'm freshly home from a 7 night Carribean cruise with Big Al which was pretty damn cool.  Our planned family reunion in Lower Right Butt Cheeck, Arkansas was canceled by my dearest Grandmother so Ali and I got to plan a fun vacation instead.  We pretty much did a big ass lap around Cuba, embarking in Miami and heading to Cozumel, Grand Caymen, and Jamaica, in that order before circling back to Miami.  Despite feeling the urge to baa or moo occasionally as myself and 3000 other cruisers were herded on and off of boats and islands, it was areally great time.  Nothing wrong with sipping fru-fru drinks and napping on the blissfully top-optional deck (no cameras, please) of a floating resort.  I'd definitely cruise again if given the opportunity.  The only thing that freaked me out the whole time was the absolute absence of any American crew members.  All the help wore name tags and there seemed to be a preponderance of Easter Europeans and no Americans.  Didn't bother me, it was just weird.  And no, I didn't buy any reefer in Jamaica....though I had many opportunities.    Kudos to those who spotted the Lebowskiness of the title of this post.
